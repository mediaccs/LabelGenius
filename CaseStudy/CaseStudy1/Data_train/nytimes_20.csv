Travel,Resort and Tour News: Jewels in Russia; Hotels in Bermuda,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/travel/resort-and-tour-news-jewels-in-russia-hotels-in-bermuda.html,"A major project to increase tourism is underway on the island of Bermuda: The Bermuda-based real estate company Morgan's Point Ltd. announced today its plans for Caroline Bay, a development on the island's west end with a 79-room Ritz-Carlton Reserve hotel, residences, restaurants, high-end retail shops and a megayacht marina with slips for 77 boats and 21 super yachts. Construction for the project has already started and is expected to be completed in 2018. Morgan's Point is planning a second phase of development within Caroline Bay that includes a larger hotel, an inner harbor megayacht marina, more residences and a boardwalk.

Rocco Forte Hotels wants the guests at its 10 properties to see their destination like a local, and to help make that happen, the brand recently launched Insiders, a program of itineraries created by notable residents in each city. Guests of the hotels will find a package in their rooms with a map of the city along with a guide of suggestions from three locals on their most treasured places to eat, drink and visit. Guests at the Hotel Astoria, St. Petersburg, for example, can read recommendations from Irada Vovnenko, the deputy director of St. Isaac's Cathedral; she likes early morning walks along Nevsky Prospect, a lunch of sea bass at Astoria Cafe and walking in the park at Tsarskoye Selo in the suburb of Pushkin. Munich, Frankfurt and London are among other cities where Rocce Forte has properties.

Appreciating Russia's past and present jewelry culture is the focus of a new trip from the art travel company Adventures in Art. Called ""Jewels of Russia,"" it takes place from May 22 to 26 in St. Petersburg and Moscow and includes a visit to the Faberge Museum at the Shuvalov Palace in St. Petersburg; in Moscow, travelers get a tour of the imperial crown jewels at the Diamond Fund in the Kremlin, a visit to the workshop of the renowned contemporary jeweler Ilgiz Fazulzyanov and dinner at the home of a prominent jewelry collector. The company's co-founders, the art specialist Karen Stone Talwar and the jewelry historian Amanda Triossi, will lead the trip. Prices from $7,950 a person.

PHOTOGRAPHY IS THE FOCUS FOR LUXURY COLLECTION PROGRAM

The Luxury Collection Hotels & Resorts, a portfolio of more than a 100 high-end properties that is part of Starwood Hotels & Resorts, is collaborating with Leica Camera to lend its guests cameras during their stay. The cameras are available on a first-come, first-serve basis through the concierge and come with a booklet of images by a notable local photographer who shares suggestions on locations to shoot. The French photographer Francois Fontaine, for example, guides guests of the Prince de Galles in Paris to capture picturesque spots throughout the city such as the art museum Musee Bourdelle. Meanwhile, the New York-based photographer Jillian Guyette encourages guests at the Chatwal to photograph such landmarks as the Chelsea Flower Market. The program is free, and guests get a memory card of their images to take home.","What you need to know if you're planning a trip, including loaner Leica cameras and locally sourced itineraries for hotel guests.",b5b9ae6d-d44a-5bbb-9da4-112e57b292c6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/16/travel/16intransit-wednesday2/16intransit-wednesday-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=42f376bbf1f8d4e588156a4bdf88378193716e09ba3d51c01a88fc70fbaa7ee6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A rendering of Caroline Bay, a development on Bermuda's west end.",b5b9ae6d-d44a-5bbb-9da4-112e57b292c6,N24News/imgs/b5b9ae6d-d44a-5bbb-9da4-112e57b292c6.jpg,4
Theater,'Hamilton' and 'Harry Potter' Productions Try to Outwit Scalpers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/12/theater/hamilton-harry-potter-scalping-broadway.html,"LONDON -- ""Hamilton"" and the new ""Harry Potter"" play are the hottest theatrical shows of the moment, with ""Hamilton"" outgrossing everything else on Broadway, and Harry, Hermione and Ron drawing hordes of muggles to London's West End. But success has a side effect: Both shows have fallen prey to high-tech scalpers who harvest large quantities of seats and resell them at exorbitant markups. ""Hamilton"" has been hit particularly hard: When it first opened on Broadway, nearly 80 percent of seats were purchased by automated ticket bots, and for Lin-Manuel Miranda's final performance, resellers were seeking an average of $10,900 a seat. Now, as ""Hamilton"" prepares to open in London this fall and ""Harry Potter"" plans to open on Broadway next year, the producers of both shows are aggressively trying to contain scalping, a long-festering problem for the entertainment industry that has been exacerbated by technology. The producers of ""Hamilton"" are trying an unusual approach for theater -- paperless ticketing -- while the producers of ""Harry Potter"" are refusing to accept resold tickets. And in the United States and Britain, policy makers are tackling the issue anew, concerned about the effect of industrialized scalping on consumers and artists.

Mr. Mackintosh is on the front lines of the latest battle against resellers. In addition to being a producer, he is an owner of major theaters in the West End, including Victoria Palace, where ""Hamilton"" will begin performances in November. For the tickets that just went on sale -- and the first block immediately sold out -- the show is trying paperless ticketing, which has long been used for concerts, to the consternation of ticket brokers. Picture this: Instead of receiving a traditional ticket from the box office or a facsimile printed at home, you just get an email confirming your purchase. Then, on the day of the show, you have to bring the same credit card you used for the purchase -- as well as the email confirmation and a photo ID -- and run the credit card through a scanner to get in. The theory is that requiring the same credit card for purchase and entrance should complicate efforts by would-be resellers. ""Going to the theater is expensive enough as it is with the money that you need to charge to put these big shows on, so it's absolutely ridiculous for it to be inflated by third parties,"" Mr. Mackintosh said.

""We have no silver bullet, but we are trying to do everything we can within the law, and it has made a massive difference,"" said Sonia Friedman, a lead producer of the ""Harry Potter"" play. Ms. Friedman and her co-producer, Colin Callender, said they would be consulting with New York producers and officials about what steps they might take to limit resales when their show opens next year on Broadway, where it is also expected to be a blockbuster. The secondary ticketing market is a big business that has long been a significant factor for major concerts and sports events. Live Nation Entertainment, the company that owns Ticketmaster, has estimated it at $8 billion a year. And the business is increasingly global, making any one country's laws difficult to enforce.

StubHub, a large ticket reselling company, said it supported legislation to combat ""bot misuse"" but also argued that producers shared blame for high ticket prices. ""There continues to be a lack of transparency in the primary market about how many tickets are available for public sale,"" the company said. ""This is despite the fact that the industry and regulators continue to put pressure on the secondary industry, rather than attempting to tackle these problems at the source."" Theater producers said they objected to reselling on two grounds: It limits access, by making it harder for people who are not wealthy to afford popular shows, and it deprives theater artists, presenters and investors of profits that should be theirs but instead go to ticket brokers.

At a recent performance of ""Harry Potter"" in London, ticket holders expressed considerable wariness about resellers. ""I was looking in at all the touting sites, all the reselling sites, and the same type of ticket I got was going for like 600 pounds a ticket -- it was ridiculous,"" said Lauren Putland, 26, of Portsmouth, England. But Ms. Putland acknowledged that she had once used a reseller to obtain tickets to a Britney Spears concert. ""I was literally obsessed with her -- I would have done anything to go to her Circus tour -- so I paid over the odds for that,"" she said. The issue affects other shows beyond ""Hamilton"" and ""Harry Potter,"" for which demand seriously outstrips supply. New York Theater Workshop, an Off Broadway nonprofit that has just 200 seats and is perhaps best known as the birthplace of ""Rent,"" has emerged as a test case because it has recently had two shows with strong crossover appeal: ""Lazarus,"" featuring songs by David Bowie, who died while the production was running, and ""Othello,"" starring Daniel Craig and David Oyelowo.

In Britain, where pop musicians have been far more vocal about scalping concerns, an advocacy group, the FanFair Alliance, was founded last year by a group of artists and powerful managers (Mumford & Sons, Ed Sheeran and more). Adele has become a high-visibility example of how artists are trying to control scalping. Using Songkick, a boutique ticketing company, she has sold hundreds of thousands of seats directly to fans, which Songkick says has drastically reduced their availability on the secondary market. But while she was able to sell two-thirds of the tickets to her four coming Wembley Stadium shows, industry practices limited Songkick's allotment in the United States to 8 percent of the ticket inventory. Songkick is suing Ticketmaster in federal court in the United States over those restrictions, which it says are anticompetitive. In London, Parliament is considering antibot legislation after the release last year of a critical investigation of the market, written by Michael Waterson, an economics professor at the University of Warwick. The House of Commons held hearings in November, expressing concern about close relationships between the sellers and resellers. (In an article for The Telegraph, Damian Collins, a Conservative member of Parliament, wrote, ""The ticketing industry in the United Kingdom has become a national scandal."") Another government agency, the Competition and Markets Authority, has opened its own investigation. ""Quite a lot is happening at last,"" said Sharon Hodgson, a Labour member of Parliament who has been pushing for years for legislation to restrain resellers. ""The secondary market is a bit nervous, and they should be.""","As ""Hamilton"" heads to London and ""Harry Potter"" comes to New York, the two plays are experimenting with measures to limit reselling of their tickets.",96a6ac41-ff54-521e-98ee-c3d807175e7d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/25/arts/25POTTER-KNOW2/13SCALPING1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=d05f399c46b57e0e00837391732f3e2eaae6e9829de60d4e43c33d774c870c58&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Tickets have been in high demand for the London production and the New York production is expected to be the same.,96a6ac41-ff54-521e-98ee-c3d807175e7d,N24News/imgs/96a6ac41-ff54-521e-98ee-c3d807175e7d.jpg,10
Theater,"Hugh Southern, a Creator of the TKTS Booth, Dies at 87",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/21/theater/hugh-southern-dead.html,"Hugh Southern held some high-profile jobs. He was acting chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts during the culture wars of the 1980s and, briefly, general manager of the Metropolitan Opera. But perhaps his most lasting legacy stems from an earlier stint as executive director of the Theater Development Fund, a nonprofit organization in New York that supports the performing arts. While there, Mr. Southern helped establish the TKTS booth in Times Square, where over the years millions of theatergoers have bought discounted same-day tickets to some of the most heralded shows both on and off Broadway. Mr. Southern died on July 15 in a hospital in Leesburg, Va. He was 87. His wife, Kathy Dwyer Southern, said the cause was pneumonia and congestive heart failure.

The British-born Mr. Southern was dragged into the culture wars in 1989 over exhibitions, financed by the National Endowment for the Arts, that some deemed obscene and anti-Christian. It was his finesse with Congress over this issue that impressed a Metropolitan Opera search committee, which was looking for a general manager. But before working at those renowned institutions, Mr. Southern was, from 1968 to 1982, the first executive director of the Theater Development Fund, an organization whose goal was to increase audiences for the performing arts in New York. At the time, the Broadway theater was in the doldrums and Times Square was to be avoided. Mr. Southern was among those who believed that some revenue from a discounted seat was better than no revenue from an empty seat. This was initially a hard sell to Broadway producers, who worried that cut-rate tickets would drain away patrons who would otherwise pay full price. A team that included Mr. Southern, Mayor John V. Lindsay, the Shubert Organization and Anna Crouse, wife of the playwright Russel Crouse and a member of the fund's board, helped convince them otherwise.

Only by paying full price, they pointed out, could patrons be assured of seeing the show they wanted to see, when they wanted to see it, in seats they chose, without having to stand in line in bad weather. At the same time, they argued, discounted tickets could make up for some lost revenue and open up the theater to people who might not otherwise go. The producers gave it a try. The first TKTS booth, which was actually a trailer donated by the city Parks Department, opened in June 1973 in Duffy Square, the northern part of Times Square, between 46th and 47th Streets and between Broadway and Seventh Avenue. It has been upgraded over the years and today is a modern glass affair tucked under a set of ruby-red glass steps, where ticket buyers congregate amid the panoply of humanity that swarms through the Crossroads of the World. TKTS now also has two satellite booths in Manhattan, one at Lincoln Center and the other at the South Street Seaport. And business is booming. In the fiscal year that ended June 30, in which a record 14.7 million people saw Broadway shows, the TKTS booth at all three locations sold more than 1.1 million same-day discounted tickets, about 8 percent of all tickets sold. Hugh Southern was born on March 20, 1932, in Newcastle upon Tyne, in the north of England, to Norman and Phyllis Margaret (Hiller) Southern. His father was a lawyer, his mother a homemaker.

So eager was he to seek opportunities in America that he and his first wife, Jane Rosemary (Llewellyn) Southern, moved to New York in 1955 before he graduated. He returned to Cambridge for several months to finish his degree before moving to New York permanently. He and his first wife divorced, and in 1988 he married Kathy (Ayers) Dwyer. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his children from his first marriage, William and Hillary Llewellyn Southern; a son, Jaime, from his second; and three grandchildren. After spending 14 years at the Theater Development Fund, Mr. Southern was deputy chairman of programs for the National Endowment for the Arts from 1982 to 1989. In 1989 he was named acting chairman while President George H. W. Bush sought a permanent chairman. At the time, critics were complaining about taxpayer funding of the arts. Their outrage exploded in 1989 when an N.E.A. grant of $15,000 supported an exhibition of the work of Andres Serrano, which included a photograph of a crucifix submerged in the artist's urine. Many on the religious right, most prominently the North Carolina Republican senator Jesse Helms, railed against the N.E.A. and called for it to be abolished. ""I most certainly can understand that the work in question has offended many people,"" he wrote to Congress. ""I personally found it offensive."" But, he added, the N.E.A. ""is expressly forbidden in its authorizing legislation from interfering with the artistic choices made by its grantees."" He added that the agency had provoked very few controversies with the 85,000 grants it had awarded in its nearly 25-year history.

Shortly thereafter, President Bush named a permanent head of the agency, John Frohnmayer, and Mr. Southern left. In the end, Congress tightened the rules by which such grants were made, but slightly increased the agency's appropriation. ""He stayed cool under fire and had a lovely sense of humor,"" his wife said in a phone interview. ""And the British accent didn't hurt."" The Metropolitan Opera noticed Mr. Southern's finesse and hired him as its general manager, even though he had had little experience with opera. That lack of experience ""did concern us,"" Louise Humphrey, president of the Met's board and head of the search committee, told The New York Times in 1989. But, she said, Mr. Southern got along with people and could help with fund-raising, and she singled out his ""diplomacy"" in responding to Senator Helms. But after just eight months on the job, Mr. Southern shocked the opera world by stepping down. He said he had ""not found fulfillment."" Others said his authority had been limited, given that the previous general manager had remained as a powerful member of the Met board. At the same time, James Levine, the company's longtime conductor and artistic director, retained control over artistic matters, leaving Mr. Southern little room to spread his wings. After he left the Met, he worked with various artistic institutions, including the Virginia Festival of American Film (now the Virginia Film Festival) in Charlottesville, the New York State Council on the Arts and Film Forum in Manhattan. Although he loved living in the United States, he also loved being British, his wife said. But he finally became an American citizen in 2015 -- moved to do so, she said, because for the first time he felt compelled to vote.","He held high-profile positions at the Metropolitan Opera and the National Endowment for the Arts, battling critics who wanted to abolish the agency.",5c89223f-5e10-57ac-941a-ac3d8a192293,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/26/obituaries/19Southern1/19Southern1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=ecb4978312652442a906525e6cb893f9484f4d5a8a78dc8df83810b0109e6048&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Hugh Southern in his office at the Theater Development Fund in Manhattan in 1982.

Science,3 Who Studied Unusual States of Matter Win Nobel Prize in Physics,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/science/nobel-prize-physics-topology.html,"David J. Thouless, F. Duncan M. Haldane and J. Michael Kosterlitz won the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work in topology, a branch of mathematics that describes properties that change only in increments.

David J. Thouless, F. Duncan M. Haldane and J. Michael Kosterlitz won the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work in topology, a branch of mathematics that describes properties that change only in increments. SOUNDBITE (English) Goran K. Hansson, Permanent Secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences: ""The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has decided to award the 2016 Nobel Prize in physics with one half to David J. Thouless and the other half to F. Duncan Haldane and J. Michael Kosterlitz for theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and topological phases of matter."" SOUNDBITE (English) Duncan Haldane, Nobel laureate in Physics: ++AUDIO VIA PHONE++ I was very, very surprised. And very gratified. There's a lot of tremendous new discoveries, which are based on this original work and have extended it many ways, and now happening."" SOUNDBITE (English) Thors Hans Hansson, Member of Nobel Committee and Professor of Theoretical Physics: It has combined beautiful mathematical and profound physics insights and has achieved unexpected results that have been confirmed by experiments. It's really beautiful and it's deep.

Three physicists born in Britain but now working in the United States were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics on Tuesday for research into the bizarre properties of matter in extreme states, including superconductors, superfluids and thin magnetic films. David J. Thouless of the University of Washington was awarded half of the prize of 8 million Swedish kronor, or about $930,000, while F. Duncan M. Haldane of Princeton University and J. Michael Kosterlitz of Brown University shared the other half. The scientists relied on advanced mathematical models to study ""theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and topological phases of matter,"" in the words of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. Their studies may have major applications in electronics, materials science and computing. In an email, Michael S. Turner, a physicist at the University of Chicago, described the work as ""truly transformational, with long-term consequences both practical and fundamental.""

Why did they win? The three laureates sought to understand matter that is so cold or so thin that weird quantum effects overpower the random atomic jostling that dominates ordinary existence. Superconductivity, in which all electrical resistance vanishes in matter, is one example of such an effect. Dr. Thouless and Dr. Kosterlitz worked together at the University of Birmingham in the 1970s to investigate what happens when two-dimensional films of matter shift from one exotic phase, like superconductivity, to another.

The key to their success was something called topology, a branch of mathematics focused on the fundamental shapes of things. At the Nobel news conference in Stockholm, Thors Hans Hansson, a member of the Nobel physics committee, tried to illustrate topology by holding up a cinnamon bun, a bagel and a pretzel. To a topologist, he said, the only difference between them is the number of holes, as opposed to the characteristics an average person might notice, like saltiness or sweetness. There is no such thing as half a hole, the topologist would note, and the number of holes only changes stepwise in integers.

Likewise, the macroscopic properties of exotic matter change in stepwise ""quantum leaps"" if the materials involved are thin or small enough that their behavior is determined by the strange rules that govern the behavior of atoms. An example is the quantum Hall effect, in which the electrical resistance of a thin film changes in stepwise fashion. In 1983, Dr. Thouless was able to link these changes mathematically to the so-called Chern numbers -- after the mathematician Shiing-Shen Chern -- that characterize topological shapes. Dr. Haldane used a similar technique to analyze the properties of chains of atoms so skinny that they could be considered one-dimensional threads. Someday, they may be the basis of a new kind of computer. In the last decade, this work has led to the development of materials called topological insulators, which conduct electricity on their surfaces but not inside.

""They have ignited a firestorm of research, and although applications are still yet to come, I believe it's only a matter of time before their research leads to advances as unimaginable to us now as lasers and computer chips were a hundred years ago,"" said Laura H. Greene, president-elect of the American Physical Society. Who are the winners? Dr. Thouless, 82, was born in Bearsden, Scotland, was an undergraduate at Cambridge University and received a Ph.D. in 1958 from Cornell. From 1965 to 1978, he taught mathematical physics at the University of Birmingham in England, where he collaborated with Dr. Kosterlitz. In 1980, he joined the University of Washington in Seattle, where he is now an emeritus professor.

Dr. Haldane, 65, was born in London. He received his Ph.D. from Cambridge, where he was also an undergraduate, in 1978. He worked at the Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble, France; the University of Southern California; Bell Laboratories; and the University of California, San Diego, before joining the Princeton faculty in 1990. Dr. Kosterlitz, 73, was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, and received his doctorate in high-energy physics from Oxford University in 1969. He has worked at the University of Birmingham; the Institute of Theoretical Physics in Turin, Italy; and Cornell, Princeton, Bell Laboratories and Harvard. ""I was very surprised and very gratified,"" Dr. Haldane, whom the Nobel committee reached by phone Tuesday morning, told reporters at the news conference in Stockholm. ""The work was a long time ago, but it's only now that a lot of tremendous new discoveries are based on this original work and have extended it."" Dr. Kosterlitz told The Associated Press that he had gotten the news while heading to lunch in Helsinki, Finland, where he is a visiting professor at Aalto University.

""I'm a little bit dazzled,"" he said. ""I'm still trying to take it in."" He said that he was in his 20s when he began studying two-dimensional materials and that his ""complete ignorance"" was an advantage in challenging the established science. ""I didn't have any preconceived ideas,"" he said. ""I was young and stupid enough to take it on."" Who else has won a Nobel this year? Yoshinori Ohsumi, a Japanese cell biologist, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for his discoveries on how cells recycle their content, a process known as autophagy, a Greek term for ""self-eating.""","David J.

Media,Nickelodeon to Offer a Streaming Service as Viacom Steps Up Digital Efforts,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/30/business/nickelodeon-to-offer-direct-to-consumer-streaming-service.html,"Nickelodeon, the entertainment group focused on children's programming, said on Thursday that it would start a new subscription streaming service in March that will be available outside traditional cable or satellite television packages. The new offering from the home of ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" and ""Dora the Explorer"" will have a distinct brand intended to draw in children and their parents. More details of the product are to be disclosed in advertising sales presentations next month. ""We want to satisfy the demand that is coming from the viewers out there,"" said Philippe Dauman, chief executive of Viacom, the media conglomerate that owns Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy Central. ""They have an insatiable appetite for great content,"" he added. ""They want to view that content on every device that they own.""

The move signals an attempt by Viacom to prove its relevance at a time of mega-mergers and rapid digital transformations that are upending the media business. Shares in the company slid about 12 percent in 2014, after persistent ratings struggles and advertising declines. The total audience for Viacom's television networks tumbled 18 percent during the quarter that ended Dec. 31, according to Bernstein Research. Viacom has blamed issues with the measurement process used for determining ratings for the declines. ""There is a frustration at Viacom and many other media companies that the world is moving and that the tools they have at their disposal will not help them accomplish their goals,"" said Michael Nathanson, a media analyst with MoffettNathanson Research. Nickelodeon introduced a number of digital initiatives in the last year, including new apps and original series for the web and mobile. Its programming also is available for streaming on Amazon. With the offering it announced on Thursday, Viacom joins other television groups that are starting their own streaming services. CBS started a $6-a-month option in October and HBO is expected to start a stand-alone streaming service this year. Viacom may have to tread more carefully than its rivals, analysts said. Its business is built on selling its bundle of television networks to cable and satellite companies, which in turn package those networks together for subscribers. In the quarter ended Dec. 31, Viacom earned $1.1 billion, about a third of its total revenue, from those so-called affiliate fees.

While creating a compelling digital-only offering from Nickelodeon could increase both subscription and advertising revenue, it could also encourage viewers to abandon their cable or satellite subscriptions, analysts said. In turn, the cable and satellite companies could drop Viacom from their lineup or force the media group to significantly cut its rates. Viacom then would need to create equally compelling subscription streaming services for its other networks, which also include VH1, BET, TV Land and Spike.

""They don't want to destroy the rest of the bundle,"" said David Bank, a media analyst with RBC Capital Markets. ""If it does disrupt the bundle, do they have to roll out a similar strategy with all of their properties? Will those be as compelling?"" When asked whether Viacom would need to consolidate with another television group to protect its negotiating power with cable and satellite distributors, Mr. Dauman said that the company was confident that it was on solid footing on its own. The comments came as Viacom reported earnings that matched analysts' expectations for the quarter ended Dec. 31. Net income declined 9 percent to $500 million, or $1.20 a share. Total revenue increased 5 percent to $3.3 billion, helped by a 6 percent increase in the filmed entertainment group. Domestic advertising revenue declined 6 percent for the quarter, dragged down by ratings issues. In a call with analysts, Viacom executives also disclosed -- without providing details -- that they would reorganize the business in the coming months to better position the company for future growth. Analysts said that the reorganization was likely to result in layoffs, with the company favoring workers with technical skills over those with traditional television backgrounds. Viacom also announced that it was spending about $400 million on two separate transactions. One was an agreement to acquire five regional television channels in India, which it will own with its existing Indian partner, Network18.

Mr. Dauman said Viacom also was negotiating another acquisition ""that would add to our scale in an important part of our business."" The company has reportedly been in talks to acquire a trio of comedy websites, including The Onion, Funny or Die and CollegeHumor. Sumner M. Redstone, Viacom's chairman and controlling shareholder, was notably absent from the company's conference call. Mr. Redstone, 91, usually makes short opening remarks. The company said he listened in from Los Angeles. Separately, Time Warner Cable, the country's second-largest cable operator, on Thursday reported earnings that missed analysts expectations for the quarter ended Dec. 31. Net income was $554 million, or $1.95 a share, up from $540 million, or $1.89 a share, in the year-earlier period. Total revenue increased 3.8 percent to $5.8 billion, bolstered by an uptick in its business services group and the sale of Internet services.

Technology,Zuckerberg to Admit That Facebook Has Trust Issues,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/technology/zuckerberg-libra-facebook-cryptocurrency.html,"In his testimony, Mr. Zuckerberg is expected to promote the benefits of Libra. He plans to describe Libra as a democratizing financial system that will mostly benefit the poor, as well as the estimated 14 million people in the United States who do not have access to bank accounts and who cannot afford banking fees.

""People pay far too high a cost -- and have to wait far too long -- to send money home to their families abroad. The current system is failing them,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said in the advance version of his testimony. ""The financial industry is stagnant and there is no digital financial architecture to support the innovation we need. I believe this problem can be solved, and Libra can help.""

Facebook's cryptocurrency project is the latest controversy to draw Mr. Zuckerberg to Washington.

Last week, he delivered a manifesto on free expression at Georgetown University, defying requests by Democratic politicians to take down false and misleading information by political leaders. Weeks earlier, he met with President Trump and Republican lawmakers to beat down accusations that Facebook gives priority to liberal-leaning content.

The House hearing will be the second time Mr. Zuckerberg has testified on Capitol Hill. In 2018, he was asked to respond to claims that the company did not properly handle its users' data and had not treated privacy concerns with seriousness.

A few weeks after Libra was unveiled, Maxine Waters, Democrat from California and chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, led several lawmakers in a call for Facebook to stop the project until it was vetted by lawmakers and regulators. David Marcus, the Facebook executive in charge of Libra, appeared before Ms. Waters's committee in July, but he appeared to make little progress toward detente with the lawmakers.",The chief executive is expected to testify on Wednesday at a House committee hearing about his company's cryptocurrency project.,d3348e1b-9bff-558c-9a41-7b6d3754298b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/business/22libra/22libra-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=735b2b64c73ec07b3402739a4f9ce5a6b5945a6d17ff765931593038cfdbb299&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Mark Zuckerberg is expected to testify at a House committee hearing on Wednesday about his company's cryptocurrency project.,d3348e1b-9bff-558c-9a41-7b6d3754298b,N24News/imgs/d3348e1b-9bff-558c-9a41-7b6d3754298b.jpg,20
Television,Netflix Renews 'One Day at a Time',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/arts/television/one-day-at-a-time-netflix-renews.html,"The ecstatically reviewed Netflix series ""One Day at a Time"" has been renewed for a third season.

The show may seem out of place with the current television landscape in many respects: It's an earnest multicamera comedy based off Norman Lear's 1975 sitcom. But it has built a rabid following online and in particular received strong support among Latinos. The show follows three generations of a Cuban-American family, which includes a divorced veteran with PTSD (Justina Machado), her widowed immigrant mother (Rita Moreno) and her lesbian teenage daughter (Isabella Gomez).

The second season arrived on Netflix in January, without an indication of whether it would get renewed again. The silence prompted organizations like the National Hispanic Media Coalition as well as critics at Vulture and The Hollywood Reporter to call for the show's renewal.

In her New York Times review, Margaret Lyons wrote that the show ""radiates delight"" and ""cultivates an intimacy and sense of belonging that goes a step further, introducing a level of genuine human happiness into the experience.""",The celebrated show follows three generations of Cuban-Americans through modern life.,6bb7f1d2-1377-5831-b27e-213c7c0f36a5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/26/arts/27oneday-item/oneday-2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=cf4e946d6442a40953722fe760e2acd9279d337fda4227191dcf6ea28deec988&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ed Quinn and Justina Machado in ""One Day at a Time.""",6bb7f1d2-1377-5831-b27e-213c7c0f36a5,N24News/imgs/6bb7f1d2-1377-5831-b27e-213c7c0f36a5.jpg,3
Real Estate,Shopping for Portable Lamps,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/realestate/shopping-for-portable-lamps.html,"When there is no electrical outlet nearby or you want to bring light into a dark landscape, having a portable, rechargeable lamp comes in handy.

""The beauty of rechargeable lanterns is that we can put them into places where we don't have power,"" said Nathan Orsman, a lighting designer based in New York City and Southampton. ""Near water and pools, or outdoor dining areas where we can't pull a wire to do something more permanent.""

They are especially ideal for outdoor parties, Mr. Orsman said, because they can be used to temporarily illuminate stairs and tables. But they are also useful indoors, as bedside lamps that can light the path to the bathroom or the kitchen in the middle of the night.

In recent years, Mr. Orsman said, ""the technology has become so much better,"" with lamps that provide a more pleasing color of light, brighter output and better battery life.","For outdoor entertaining at night, there is nothing better than a portable, rechargeable lamp — unless it's a bunch of them.",ae051fa1-5d5a-593e-b369-1f1b68b9bb1f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/05/realestate/05shopping1/05shopping1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=57188686faaf08ffaebbf57c647aa249f5cc016026d1dd91fd5274a0d948e44c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Portable lamps are ideal for illuminating outdoor landscapes where power cords won't reach (above, The Others rechargeable woven lanterns by Stephen Burks, from $1,300 each at Dedon).",ae051fa1-5d5a-593e-b369-1f1b68b9bb1f,N24News/imgs/ae051fa1-5d5a-593e-b369-1f1b68b9bb1f.jpg,7
Well,No Such Thing as a Math Person,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/well/family/trying-to-add-up-girls-and-math.html,"When I wrote about fending off math anxiety last month I learned both from the experts I interviewed and from people to whom I happened to mention the topic that math anxiety is found across all lines of gender, ethnicity and educational background. There are plenty of men and women out there, including the highly educated and the professionally aggressive (professors and corporate lawyers, say), who proudly -- or shamefacedly -- wave the math anxiety flag. Oh yes, that's me, I don't have a math brain -- though the whole idea of a math brain is frowned on by those who study this topic. There is a general assumption that women are affected more than men, and that math and math anxiety contribute to the barriers that keep women underrepresented in the STEM fields. In my own familial experiment, I have two sons and a daughter, and though everyone managed O.K. in math, the daughter was, without question, the math kid -- though the very idea of ""math kids"" is considered part of the problem. My daughter, who majored in math in college, feels that the key is that she attended an all-girls school from fifth grade through 12th grade, and isn't sure she would have stayed with math if she'd gone to a coed school. I believe her -- though the research literature doesn't necessarily support her, from a statistical point of view. That's one of the interesting things about trying to think about girls and math: It involves questioning some of your assumptions about how children learn, and about what makes some topics harder or less accessible to lots of people. And then trying to look at research that tells you that your own perceptions and experience may not be reliable.

As far as math anxiety, ""many many more girls and women than men are anxious,"" said Jo Boaler, a professor of mathematics education at Stanford, ""and we know anxiety holds people back -- there are still messages out there that math is for boys and not for girls."" Some of the anxiety, she said, may be transmitted by elementary school teachers, who are likely to be female, and are often themselves anxious about math. ""We know that girls identify with their elementary teachers,"" she said, and are more likely than boys to be affected by the teacher's math anxiety, if it is present, contributing to what she called ""the cycle by which this continues."" Sian Beilock, a professor of psychology at the University of Chicago, pointed to the pressure created by the stereotype that girls aren't good at math. ""They come in feeling pressure that could affect their performance,"" she said. ""That can rob people of the cognitive horsepower they would have to perform at their best."" And this can be worst for the best students, she said. ""Girls who come in with the most ability to work at a high level are most impacted."" Andrei Cimpian, an associate professor of psychology at New York University who studies children's ideas on gender and ability, said that there is lots of variability in the distribution of men and women across fields in the sciences, social sciences and humanities. One key, he said, is whether it is perceived that in order to work in a certain field, a person needs to be brilliant, to have, even, a spark of genius. ""When we surveyed academics across disciplines, in fields whose members said, yes, there is something innate, inborn, required for success,"" he said, ""it was particularly in those fields where we saw women underrepresented, also African-Americans.""

And what about this whole idea of math brain and math kid? ""Metaphors like math brain can create their own reality,"" Dr. Cimpian warned. ""We all fall on a certain continuum,"" he said. Dr. Boaler, the author of the book ""Mathematical Mindsets,"" said: ""The message to all kids, girls and boys, is there's no such thing as a math person."" And what about my daughter's belief that she owes a lot to being in math classes with no boys in them? Erin Pahlke, an assistant professor of psychology at Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash., said, ""often the girls in the single-sex schools have higher math achievement, better attitudes, lower levels of math anxiety, they often have better hopes for the future of wanting to take higher level math,"" she said. ""You say, this is incredible, single-sex schooling is the answer!"" But she was the first author of a 2014 meta-analysis representing the testing of 1.6 million students from 21 countries that found that among the high quality studies, the differences could be explained by looking at such factors as the different socioeconomic status of those choosing single-sex education, and at the pretest scores before the girls entered the single-sex schools as well as measures of school quality and resources. Dr. Pahlke said that people tell her all the time, ""my daughter or my niece went to a single-sex school and it was incredible -- I would say to them, yes, I agree, you do see that, but the question is whether or not it's due to the single-sex environment."" Instead, she said, ""it's due to being around girls who came in with higher math scores, or teacher quality differences, that's what the research suggests."" She said the popular idea that boys and girls learn differently is ""not supported by the neuroscientific literature."" ""Most of the things that parents and kids believe about math learning are wrong,"" said Dr. Boaler, who is the co-founder of Youcubed, a website that argues for a revolution in math teaching for all children, and offers resources to teachers, students and parents. In fact, maybe what everyone needs -- girls and boys both -- is a different kind of math teaching, with much less emphasis on timed tests, and more attention to teaching math as a visual subject, and as a place for creativity. ""The lovely thing is when you change math education and make it more about deep conceptual understanding, the gender differences disappear,"" Dr. Boaler said. ""Boys and girls both do well.""","Going to an all-girls school isn't necessarily what makes a girl good at math, research finds.",a0e07f79-703b-584f-abe5-08baf0a6f8d7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/15/science/well-family-math/well-family-math-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=29aafc7659c0969e24985ec354bdb7ff6830b9d14ef7b4e3209f89038d27bbe4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Fifth-graders Shoaa Khan, left, and Briana Berreondo work through a math problem together during class at P.S. 165 in Morningside Heights.",a0e07f79-703b-584f-abe5-08baf0a6f8d7,N24News/imgs/a0e07f79-703b-584f-abe5-08baf0a6f8d7.jpg,18
Opinion,More People Will Be Fired in the Pandemic. Let's Talk About It.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/14/opinion/layoffs-coronavirus-economy.html,"It's about layoffs and it's about the fact that we don't really have a good script for how to let people go. In this culture and that the layoffs particularly now have been incredibly inhumane. They've been dehumanizing. They've been especially cruel. We already know that this is not like the right circuits. These are not precocious circumstances for layoffs right. Everybody is on zuma. At best it's awkward. Screens freeze having any kind of intimate heartfelt conversation about something as difficult as letting someone go from a job is not going to be easy under these mediated circumstances. But there are still probably more delicate ways to do this. Let's see where we have a question how do you retain workers even when the company is not earning revenue right. Well, you know that is a question one thing you can do is run in the red. I'll get to that, actually. Let's bookmark that question. And you can't always there. Layoffs are going to be inevitable in this economy. So what I did would two things. And it was no one I talked about the way you can lay people off and how you can do it in a way that is gingerly and as humane as possible. And the second thing that I talked about was how to do this. I question the actual underlying logic in some cases. Now granted the data that we have right now looking at companies that have laid off people versus companies that have run in the red that have furloughed people instead that have insisted on either pay cuts or in some cases, the CEO is not taking salaries at all in the long run. Those companies in almost every study I could find did better. The ones that actually tighten their belts and knuckled their way through it. If you looked at them versus companies that were in a comparable industry. If you looked at like what kind of profits they were making two years later guess what. It was the ones that actually insisted on furloughs and pay cuts not the ones that just gave her buddy the ax altogether. They were doing better two years later, and I mean, this is not pie in the sky stuff. This is replicated over and over again. The largest and most interesting study that looked at this was a guy named Wayne Cassius who is at the use Uc Colorado sorry university of Colorado at Denver. He looked at all of the companies publicly traded companies on the New York Stock Exchange for 36 years. And he looked at just industry by industry. He was comparing companies. This one laid people off this one, same industry didn't like lay people off. Two years later almost invariably the ones that actually resisted the layoffs did the best. So here's what I wrote about last week. We are learning how in our family right now people layoff their employees. They're doing it like bird for example, the rental car the scooter rental company. They invited 406 employees to a webinar that was a big pretext wasn't true. They invited them all to show up sat them. You know there was a slide that simply said COVID 19. That was it. The employers were left to stare in total bewilderment at this slide that said COVID 19 and suddenly a disembodied voice came in over the slide and gave a two minute presentation read from a script saying that everybody who had attended that webinar was, in fact, not attending a webinar. They were scheduled to be fired and this was their last day. Sorry which is cruel. And as somebody said afterwards, it was like an episode of Black Mirror episode. I mean, it's just this isn't it. I couldn't even make that up. I mean, frankly, I wouldn't even have put that into Black Mirror episode because it's kind of too on the nose. It's the kind of thing that I think somebody would have crumpled up in a writers room and started again from scratch with because he does that. Weight watchers did something similar where they had these simultaneous mass firings where they had people in groupings on zoom call on Zoom phone calls. Same thing read from a script 3 minutes each bloodless impersonal unkind. This isn't good. There is surely better ways to do this. I'm not saying that layoffs aren't inevitable in a deep recession. What might be a depression or the worst recession certainly that we've seen in many generations. I don't get I don't I don't want to speculate at the scale of it. But I think, look 1.5 million people applied for unemployment two weeks ago, I guess it was. I'm not sure. But the figures are this week last week. But I mean, the numbers are high. I think the question is whether everybody is thinking about this in the wrong way. We're debating whether they are conceiving of this in the wrong way. One thing I can tell you is this. Let's just look for a start. Let's assume that you have to lay people off. There are two things that matter that really profoundly deeply matter. The first thing is that people pine for a sense of fairness. So you have to look at somebody and be transparent as possible. Tell them why you tell them why you did it tell them that you're going to help them find a job you're going to give them a recommendation that you tried everything that you could. This was like a measure of last resort. And tell them how much you valued them. If you can you can give them a network of other people to speak to incomparable industries who might be hiring throw them as many lifelines as possible answer as many questions as possible and give them a chance. Give them a phone number and an email to contact after they've gotten over their shock because they're going to have more questions. How do I feed my family. How long does my health insurance run. How do I kind of pull the levers that Cobra is enacted every fight. I'm sorry somebody is weighing in every firing situation is different and exposes the firm to potential lawsuits. Script protect. Well, that may be true. So why not name those companies who have botched the handling. So if you're just joining me, I'm Jennifer Senior economist at the New York Times. Weight watchers blewett bird really blew it an example of a company that did it fairly well was Airbnb very humane layoffs had comprehensive questions. I'm sorry. I answered questions comprehensively set up a system so that everybody who is sort of cut adrift had like a way to kind of address their anxieties, and their questions. But anyway, to go back. So the other reason that, by the way, you have to lay people off humanely if you're going to do it is the morale for those who survive is somewhere down in a missile silo. I mean, it's unspeakably low right. So it's in a tunnel. I mean and this is something no one takes in 2. Let's see maybe somebody else is writing in Macy's sent a letter that if you don't hear from them, you're not going to go back. Oh, my god. I'm so glad you brought this up. So many people have contacted me on Facebook, and talked to me about the passive aggressive way of where they don't actually know an old friend of mine contacted me recently and said, somebody I knew when I was a little child not old enough to vote or tie my shoes. I think she contacted me and she said, we were we were told not to work remotely after they set us up remotely. We were told not to work remotely. And we were also told not to show up at the office, which is like some kind of Joseph Heller catch-22 like you know yossarian kind of nightmare. What is that. What is that. So this is another thing you have to be clear and you have to be courageous and you have to be transparent for the sake of not only the people that you are laying off. But for the sake of the people who are remaining. Because guess what. The second the economy strengthens again. Those people are going to be out the door. They're not going to want to. They're not going to feel any allegiance any fealty at all to a company that behaves cruelly. So that's I feel very strongly about this. And again, then I also want to challenge the wisdom of laying people off in the first place. I think it's very important to think through the idea that belt tightening matters. There are lots of CEOs who can live happily without their salaries. There are lots of people at the top tier who would gladly take a pay cut for the sake of seeing everybody around them still employed. So that they don't have to kind of undergo the turbulence and feel the survivor's guilt. They would gladly exchange 10% 20% of their salaries 30% if they're being paid extremely handsomely well for the sake of just good companies integrity. The team integrity that whatever integrity. And so that. And here's the real thing. I spoke to somebody at a university who was saying, look, you know I have tenure a lot of us have tenure. So you want to know who was going to get fired. The people who clean our bathrooms, the people who mow or lawns the people who do all these important work. Now is a chance for us to express our values. If we say that we are all willing to take a 10% pay cut across the board. So that they can show up like we will feel a lot better about ourselves they are the most vulnerable, they are the ones who are going at the hardest time getting reemployed. They tend to be the people of color they tend to be the people who are living the most sort of precarious kind of existence. We are in a position to actually who cares if five percent. This isn't even a big kind of cost saving measure. If we fire all these people from a university like that's not where the big salaries are the big sat with the people who are drawing all the big salaries are protected. I thought that was fascinating. And I thought it was really worth taking to heart. So now let me just sort of only read some of the feedback that I got, which was great, by the way. Macy's cut 70% Well Macy's is in this very interesting position because either filing for bankruptcy right. So you know the question is, how well, they were managing all along, whether they were already precarious cutting 70% is really astonishing. And I don't know if there are ways to do this more cheaply if there are ways to do what we were shoring up morale retails obviously taking a huge hit and some receptors are going to be much harder hit than others. Obviously, if you own a restaurant, you're in and you're facing a different kind of crisis than a business and/or an institution where some revenue is still coming in. And that's the difference. I think. So somebody tweeted, Good luck trying to get a count talented people to come back to work at your company when all is done. If you handled this poorly. People talk. That's exactly right. That was what I wrote and I have two words for you. Last door people ding their former employers on glassdoor. I mean, you can see all of these terrible write UPS that these companies get cut performance bonuses. I agree. Yeah, why not. I mean, also I would point out everybody's cost of living right now is much lower. It's not like people are spending through the roof. They're not like you know going on vacations on extravaganza. I mean, again, there are ways to actually do this humanely where you can I think assume that people will not need quite as much to live if they're still drawing their full salaries. It's possible that particularly at the top tier of every company that you can cinch the belt. Here is the real thing that got me started thinking about this a long time ago. I was doing a piece for New York magazine. Was looking at sort of that larger body of literature about what makes people happy. What makes people unhappy. And one of the things that I came across. And I would believed it if it hadn't been replicated and also, if it hadn't been done in huge samples involving Tens of thousands of people both in Britain and in Australia and in Germany. It looked at how people's how people adapted to be long term unemployment versus how people adapted to losing a loved one. And here's what's surprising. It was easier. If it wasn't these people adapted more quickly to losing a loved one than they did to losing a job. And when I first read that, I thought there's no way that's just too good to check. But then I looked at the methodology and the methodology was completely sound. But more to the point. More to the point you just have to think about this for a few minutes. And it starts to make sense. No one living in a constant sentences State of economic insecurity is, of course enough to destabilize anyone and significantly lower your mood thermostat. But number two, I think you care if you're laid off. It's sort of taken as a referendum on your own character. And it's going to sort of start this existential little kind of crisis, where you have this crisis of meaning. Now where you wake up and you don't know what you're doing. So I think if you look at it as something that's deeply personal. Whereas you know if you lose loved one. It's obviously, you've murdered them. It's obviously not something that you can take personally. It's something that happens that you had no control over. So I think that this to a large degree explains that data point. And a lot of people have talked when they were writing to me they wrote about how traumatic it was what kind of personal hit it was how it hit them in the gut to be let go. So here. Let me start being let go. It's traumatic in nor in normal cycles. The extra burden is for us to determine how much the termination is a statement of our personal value. Exactly people mistake one for the other. And it's this constant thing. You think that you are your I mean, to a certain extent your professional identity and your personal identity whatever it is are intertwined. It's a big piece of it. And to have that you're suddenly removed is very it's anguish inducing Europe. Somebody brought up that Europe has had a better solution. And this. I regret this. This is a paragraph that's on the cutting room floor. In my story. I actually mentioned this that here in the United States, we don't do what we didn't do what the Europeans did largely not every company. But not every country. But most countries actually just took over the payrolls of you know of all companies and they assumed. Then it wasn't on private, then it wasn't on these individual companies to assume the problem. OK sorry somebody who taught is writing. And do you. I think that the trauma is offset at all by the fact that so many millions are newly unemployed. Oh, that is very interesting. And you are getting to another kind of piece of the literature about happiness and well-being which is fascinating which is that like how you how you feel it is relative to what you see around you. So if you are the sole unemployed person on your block. You are going to feel worse than if there are suddenly huge numbers of you. And it is true that if there are many people suddenly out of work all at once, it probably to some degree does mitigate the sting. Right it's going to some degree it's going to soften the blow. And that's true. It's not a substitute for a paycheck for health insurance. And this is the other thing I think you know, tons of people wrote in saying now can we have a conversation about you know perhaps like kind of state provided health insurance. Is this the moment to sort of dealing our wages. I'm sorry our health insurer assurance from our like employment status. Yes, it is most assuredly is and this is, again, something I think this is a heartache that people in Europe are not facing right. They don't have to worry how they're going to get health care coverage during a pandemic. P.s. right. So that's something. OK So let's see here. Oh, this was I just sort of an exquisite rendering written with real heart by someone by a fellow named Tom Connolly in Connecticut. It's not just a job. It's who we have become where he's been he's where you be. And it's where you spend a major part of your life. A job allows you to pay your own way to support your family. Losing a job is just awful. It leaves a hole that may never be filled. It takes away the dignity of being a man or a woman. You can no longer provide for yourself or for your family in a nutshell, I think that that's exactly right. And I think that's why it cuts to the quick. And I think that that's why the more humane the a company can handle this saying it's not you you're stellar. We're invested in finding you some sort of future employment. We will do everything in our power to do so. And we will show you out the door with a fistful of recommendations you're in. You know it's just it's kinder. And by the way, also the people who remain at the company feel better if they know that the people who were let go are well provided for. I mean, the survivors feel way less guilt. Let's say somebody is saying it feels like job loss is coming for many of us. How can we prepare emotionally and professionally. You know the hard thing you know if there is a way to prepare for losing a job. I think about it because I mean, the newspaper industry is about to. I mean, there's already been tons of cuts in my industry and you know our revenues fall and our ad revenues falling off of a cliff. I don't know how the next day I run through the exercise with myself sometimes. And I try and tell myself. Now it's not personal. It's the circumstance. The pandemic. It's not me. It's the pandemic. It's not me. How fast. I mean, what does that get you. You know, I think it's in some ways incumbent on the employer again to say you can call me. Here's my phone number. Here's my email and we can discuss this again. I think people are in shock when they're laid off. They don't see it coming. They seldom do. And the best thing that you can do is be there for them through the first wave, which is utter disbelief. You're what you're letting me go. I've been here 17 years. And then you can kind of make available all kinds of logistical you can answer questions. My boss fired me through text because I chose not to go in after being given a choice quote, given a choice says somebody to me. And when someone else says that. All right. First of all, I want to address that because that is so heinous and it's consistent with some of the things that I've been getting again on Facebook. This kind of weird passive aggression as if anybody is going to go in to an office when most states are in lockdown. That's just a ridiculous request, and it's cowardly. Oh something I can tell you that I think is really interesting that I found when I was doing the research on this. I was speaking to somebody who's written one of the definitive papers about how bad bosses are at firing people because it turns out they're terrible at it. And I said to him, why. Because what they do, by the way, when they're in the middle of firing people is they become completely freaked out and destabilized because people start getting very emotional. They start bargaining. And people who are tasked with firing aren't prepared for that. How could they be right. You can have a little bit of compassion for them. It's not anything that they relish. So I ask somebody this question and the answer was amazing. They said, well honestly and in business school you don't learn this. So if you want to be school. No one teaches you how to have conversations like difficult conversations. If you're a police officer if you are a firefighter if you are a doctor you are trained in having difficult conversations. You do it on the job you do it in your apprenticeship you do it in your training. But most people don't learn how to deliver bad news. And I thought there's a real powerful argument for actually learning that. I think it's a valuable skill. I think it's an invaluable skill. Somebody earlier also said and this is absolutely true that you know how do you brace for a layoff their answer was at least find something else that defines you as a hobby baking whatever. I mean, that's a cliche, but I'm with them. I mean, you know and some people might not have the means it sounds unfathomably unfathomably luxurious to say, oh, just go big. I mean that assumes that you have a nest egg. But I think the idea that you can start at least feathering your nest with the things that bring you joy. You know you can take pleasure in your children to the extent that you can separate the anxiety from providing you know providing for them from being laid off. That matters. I think, yes, I think that like trying to build your identity around things that are not your job at this moment and time is not a bad idea in any way. Everyone's job right now is compromised. I'm not sure that people are doing the version of their job that they once knew and loved. So that would be my thought about it anyway. If you're just joining, I'm Jennifer Senior. I'm the newest columnist to join the rotation at the New York Times and what I've been talking about is my column from not today, but eight days ago about the utter rank incompetence of companies and laying people off how bad people are doing it. How inhumane and in an unmarked fold they have been in laying people off. The examples I gave were bird the scooter rental company, which had this kind of weird sci-fi Twilight Zone Twilight Zone Black Mirror experience where they let people off en masse sitting while staring at a screen that said COVID 19. They lured them there under false pretenses. And then basically a lady's disembodied voice told them that their services were no longer required. I don't know what that is. It's not human. It's honestly something spun from the looms of the most dystopian sci-fi writer's imagination that I can imagine. And somebody even compared to do you know Blackmore episode. They're right. They're totally right. Also what was the other company have I said, oh, yes weight watchers WWF international. They were horrible. It was like a three minute script. So you just read robotically from it. They didn't have the guts to tell people individually, and they couldn't because there was one all about the country. They could have made individual phone calls to different people. No didn't do it. So that was terrible. Anyway I'm not going to read some more comments. Let's see. My company just laid off a huge number of employees using pre-recorded conference calls. People were very upset about it. But we had over 20,000 employees. OK So they're saying, how can you call thousands of people personally and offer the chance to answer questions. You can't. I think a lot is riding on that pre-recorded conference call. I think what you've got to do is say this is a shock. It's so far from ideal it's so far from what I would want to do. Here are the resources that we are going to make available as a company in case this fills you with distress. And you make sure that you follow up and you follow up. Also, if there are 20,000 employees you know if you have 20,000 employees then I'm assuming that there are managers and managers managers and there's all sorts of people who can still manage those conversations some people still have to be in the building or in the metaphorical building. I mean, sorry. But a company that size is probably better equipped and ways to lay people off than smaller ones you got lots of people who manage teams in those situations. So I'm not sure I buy it. Someone just weighed in what did they say. I got let go on Sunday. I was asked not to talk to co-workers until Thursday. That was miserable. That's horrible. I'm not least because you can't commiserate. You don't know what else is going on around you. And again have so many of these layoffs strike me as like hostage situations where they're sort of like putting you in a black burlap bag and throwing you into a trunk and driving like I mean, what do you mean, you're not supposed to talk to any of your colleagues. That's absurd. You're going to need all the camaraderie and all the support you could get and also their contacts you're going to need the road x you're going to need. There's that's really. This is exposing a great big gap in you know how you write. You're going to want them to have your CV somebody is pointing out. Exactly so that they can pass it around right. They're the ones who still have extant business connections. I mean, this is just it's bananas. It's nuts. And again, I just say that this exposes a huge a huge hole in corporate culture and in small business culture too. These are important things to learn. And I feel like every small business owner should learn how to do this should you know what it is to whatever prosperity is next upon us God knows how many years from now. It's something everyone should learn. That's really the bottom line. That's what I would say anyway. I think I'm going to sign out not least because we, like many other families. We are a cliche. We have a new puppy. And so I want to go and walk him. I'm sort of kept him penned up while I've been talking. Let me just see if there's anything else. Oh one wonderful puppy cameo. Oh, I could watch for her colleague. That would require. I could walk down it. You know what. Maybe I'll do a puppy cameo. OK, I'm going to do a puppy cameo. Why the heck not. All right. So here's one other thing that somebody has mentioned that I think is very funny is that you know they're saying, you know employ it. Why is it that we ask their own please give two weeks notice. And then employer and get employers can just get people to act in like '10 seconds. And the answer is they shouldn't be able to.","For starters, don't do it on Zoom.

Books,"In 'A Promised Land,' Barack Obama Thinks — and Thinks Some More — Over His First Term",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/15/books/review-barack-obama-promised-land-memoir.html,"[The Best Books of 2020: View our full list.] The most audacious thing about Barack Obama's new memoir, ""A Promised Land,"" is the beaming portrait on its cover: There he is, the 44th president, looking so serenely confident that it's as if the book weren't arriving on the heels of a bitter election, amid a cratering economy and a raging pandemic. The ebullient image also stands at odds with the narrative inside -- 700 pages that are as deliberative, measured and methodical as the author himself. Obama says that he initially planned to write a 500-page memoir and be done in a year; what he ended up with instead is a hefty volume (now the first of an anticipated two) that stops in May 2011, shortly after his roasting of Donald Trump at the White House Correspondents' Dinner on April 30 and the killing of Osama bin Laden the day after. Obama's extraordinary first book, ""Dreams From My Father,"" was published in 1995, a year before he was elected to the Illinois senate, and traced his family history alongside his own coming-of-age. ""A Promised Land"" is necessarily less intimate and more political, offering close-up views of the major issues that Obama faced during his first term, including the economic stimulus, health care, immigration, the environment and the forever war in Afghanistan. Presumably left for the future volume are, among other fraught subjects: the 2016 election, his abdication of his own ""red line"" in Syria, the entrenchment of the surveillance state and a discussion of drone strikes. This isn't to say that ""A Promised Land"" reads like a dodge; if anything, its length testifies to what seems to be a consistently held faith on the part of the former president -- that if he just describes his thinking in sufficient detail, and clearly lays out the constellation of obstacles and constraints he faced, any reasonable American would have to understand why he governed as he did.

[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of November. See the full list. ] Nearly every president since Theodore Roosevelt has written a memoir that covers his years in office; this one contains some inevitable moments of reputation-burnishing and legacy-shaping, though the narrative hews so closely to Obama's own discursive habits of thought that any victories he depicts feel both hard-won and tenuous. An adverb he likes to use is ""still"" -- placed at the beginning of a sentence, to qualify and counter whatever he said just before. Another favorite is ""maybe,"" as he reflects on alternatives to what happened, offering frank confessions of his own uncertainties and doubts. At a time of grandiose mythologizing, he marshals his considerable storytelling skills to demythologize himself. He addresses the book to the ""next generation,"" to young people who seek to ""remake the world,"" but the story he tells is less about unbridled possibility and more about the forces that inhibit it.

He periodically reminds us how he inherited a state of emergency. As one of his friends said after Obama's historic win in 2008, when the economy was getting devoured by the Great Recession: ""Two hundred and thirty-two years and they wait until the country's falling apart before they turn it over to the brother!""

Once in office, Obama sought the help of experienced insiders instead of ""fresh talent,"" deciding that the dire circumstances ""demanded it."" Obama says he had ambitious ideas for structural change, but that his team insisted that any attempts to mete out some ""Old Testament justice"" to the banks whose avarice and recklessness had pushed the financial system to the brink would send skittish markets into a full-blown panic. But quelling markets did little to quell anger and fear -- something that conservatives, Obama noticed, were quick to seize on and use to their advantage, while the president deemed it perilous to tap into such incendiary emotions. (This seemed to be an ingrained sensibility: David Maraniss's 2012 biography of Obama has one of his mentors recalling with a touch of exasperation how even when they were doing community organizing in Chicago, Obama was ""reluctant to do confrontation, to push the other side because it might blow up."") What could have been politically beneficial to him, Obama takes pains to spell out, would have risked degrading the institutions that needed to be repaired, not demolished.

There's a dynamic that Obama describes again and again in ""A Promised Land"": establishment Republicans shrewdly finding ways to appropriate and exploit the feelings of helplessness and resentment that their own deregulatory policies had helped to bring about in the first place. ""If all this seems obvious to me now, it wasn't at the time,"" Obama writes. ""My team and I were too busy."" He recalls a Republican senator telling him, ""I hate to say it, but the worse people feel right now, the better it is for us."" (This senator may have hated to say it, but he loved to see it.) The result was a drubbing in the 2010 midterms, when Democrats lost an astounding 63 seats in the House. About the substance of those first two years in office, Obama expresses few regrets. ""We had saved the economy,"" he writes. ""We had stabilized the global financial system and yanked the U.S. auto industry from the brink of collapse."" The Affordable Care Act made health care available to another 20 million Americans. The midterms ""didn't prove that our agenda had been wrong. It just proved that -- whether for lack of talent, cunning, charm or good fortune -- I'd failed to rally the nation, as F.D.R. had once done, behind what I knew to be right."" The tone that Obama strikes in lines like these is almost mournful. He shows how a certain kind of blunt candor seemed all but unavailable to him as the first Black president. After he offered the mildest rebuke of the police officer who arrested the scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. on his own front porch, saying that the officer acted ""stupidly,"" his support among white voters plunged. In public, Obama was unfailingly conciliatory, telling reporters he ""could have calibrated my original comments more carefully,"" even as he began to realize that the issue of Black people and the police was a reminder ""that the basis of our nation's social order had never been simply about consent; that it was also about centuries of state-sponsored violence by whites against Black and brown people.""

As much as he knew this, he couldn't say it. His almost zealous commitment to moderation rankled some progressives, who had assumed that his soaring campaign rhetoric meant he was a visionary bent on overturning the status quo. Whenever he felt stuck, he fell back on empathy and ""process."" They sound like incommensurate traits -- one is inventive and literary, the other is bland and technocratic. But for Obama -- who in this book demonstrates an almost compulsive tendency to imagine himself into the lives of others (whether it's Hillary Clinton, John McCain, or, in one passage, a Somali pirate) -- a sound process ""was born of necessity."" Decisions that were made after taking into account a variety of perspectives reassured him that he wasn't blinkered by his own. ""A Promised Land"" isn't entirely about the presidency. The first 200 pages move (comparatively) briskly through Obama's early years to his life in Chicago, when his burgeoning political career put a strain on his marriage to Michelle, who had curtailed some of her own ambitions so that one of them would be present for the couple's daughters. Of course, becoming president didn't yield anything that resembled a work-life balance, though it did mean that rather than commute between Chicago and Springfield, Ill., or between Chicago and Washington, he could usually be home for dinner by 6:30 before returning to the Oval Office. He would receive his President's Daily Brief (or as Michelle called it, ""The Death, Destruction and Horrible Things Book"") at the breakfast table. He happened to be at home in April 2010 when he first got word that an explosion had torn through the Deepwater Horizon, a drilling rig off the Louisiana coast, belching fire and smoke and gushing oil -- the worst oil spill in the country's history. An underwater video feed showed ""the oil pulsing in thick columns from the surrounding wreckage,"" Obama writes, ""like emanations from hell.""

The novelty and enormity of the disaster shook him. (The technology for ultradeep underwater drilling made the Exxon Valdez look like a Tinkertoy by comparison.) Until then, Obama had maintained a ""fundamental confidence"" that he ""could always come up with a solution through sound process and smart choices."" But those ""plumes of oil rushing out of a cracked earth and into the sea's ghostly depths"" seemed of another order, unassimilable to his generally imperturbable worldview. Even after the hole was plugged and the cleanup was proceeding apace, something awful had been unleashed, with the true extent of the poisoning not yet known. A hundred pages later, Obama remembers how Republicans seemed to get increasingly petulant at the prospect of working with his administration. ""It was as if my very presence in the White House had triggered a deep-seated panic,"" he writes, ""a sense that the natural order had been disrupted."" Trump had been peddling a birtherist conspiracy theory that some conservatives seemed eager to accept. Obama doesn't force the metaphor, but the events described in ""A Promised Land"" suggest that something very old and toxic in American politics had been unleashed too. It was as if the Republican Party, having sidled up to the jagged shores of white grievance, was starting to founder on them. As he writes of the Deepwater disaster: ""Where the rest of the oil ended up, what gruesome toll it took on wildlife, how much oil would eventually settle back onto the ocean floor, and what long-term effect that might have on the entire Gulf ecosystem -- it would be years before we'd have the full picture.""",The former president recounts his political ascent and offers close-up views of the major issues he faced during his first years in the White House.,02cc717e-114d-5d09-9901-4f4345f68d15,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/15/business/15obamabook-print2/15obamabook-print2-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=fe86d86e97544999864da760ac3ce2663a7bfec488cb476f0cfe5c60d7de7512&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""A Promised Land,"" the first of two planned volumes, will be published Tuesday.",02cc717e-114d-5d09-9901-4f4345f68d15,N24News/imgs/02cc717e-114d-5d09-9901-4f4345f68d15.jpg,13
Your Money,It's a Buyer's Market for Private Islands,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/11/your-money/its-a-buyers-market-for-private-islands.html,"WHEN ultrarich Americans go house-hunting outside the United States, they've got a Caribbean soul they can barely control, to paraphrase Jimmy Buffett. Those were the findings of the Candy GPS Report, which focused on the home-buying habits of high net-worth individuals around the world -- those with more than $30 million in assets -- ranking the top 20 places where they buy additional luxury homes for leisure use. The roster, not surprisingly, included Lake Como in Italy, the Cote d'Azur in France and Aspen and Vail in the United States, as well as a few places that might not readily come to mind, like the Seychelles, the Maldives and Emirates Hills in Dubai. But for American buyers looking for property abroad, the roughly eight-square-mile island of St. Barts in the French West Indies, where the typical five-bedroom property changes hands for $14 million, topped the chart. In general, American buyers casting outside the United States favor homes in the Caribbean, the report found. (Although ""the majority of ultra-high-net-worth Americans hold their property in the U.S.A., in excess of 80 percent,"" according to Yolande Barnes, director of Savills World Research, part of the global real estate firm Savills.)

One example of a luxury property on St. Barts that is drawing American interest is Villa Au Soleil, a four-bedroom hillside villa that the actor Steve Martin put on the market last year for 7.95 million euros, or $10.75 million. Mr. Martin bought the home, which perches on the hillside in Lurin, above St. Jean Bay, as a private retreat in 2008. It had been listed for $9 million before he bought it. Last year, St. Barts experienced a significant rise in sales volumes, according to the Caribbean Prime Residential Insight 2014 report by the real estate consulting firm Knight Frank. Market activity remained strongest below EUR10 million, or $13.6 million, but 2013 also saw an uptick in the number of transactions above that threshold. Buyers from the United States were the top nationality picking up properties, followed by purchasers from Britain and elsewhere in Western Europe, Knight Frank found. For property buyers looking to stay on American soil, Virgin Islands destinations like St. Thomas and St. John, as well as Puerto Rico, remain popular. But Americans are also drawn to non-American Caribbean places like Barbados, the British Virgin Islands, Mustique, Jumby Bay and the up-and-coming Canouan, part of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, where properties average $6 million for a five-bedroom villa. Major improvements to Canouan's airport have brought more of the global wealthy within its reach, according to a report by Savills. Meantime, the Bahamas are far from passe. Proximity to the United States makes property there high on the shopping lists of wealthy American buyers, according to Savills. A favorite is Harbour Island -- a chic hangout famed for its pink sandy beaches.

And the cachet of owning a private island is picking up. Some of those most sought by American buyers are the islands in the Exuma Cays, a cluster of over 360 islands in the Bahamas, according to Chris Krolow, chief executive of Private Islands, which operates online island sales sites. In the last several years, properties have been sold to the producer/director Tyler Perry and the country singers Tim McGraw and Faith Hill. They join earlier trailblazers like the magician David Copperfield and John C. Malone, the billionaire chairman of the cable and telecommunications giant Liberty Global.

Properties in the Exumas market include 554-acre Darby Island, listed at $40 million, and Saddleback Cay, a private 47-acre island that includes a 3,000-foot airstrip and seven white sand beaches. Its price is $15.6 million. And there is also the seven-acre Goat Cay, priced at $4.8 million. ""Island sales have picked up, and it's a buyer's market right now,"" said Mr. Krolow, who fields close to 200 inquiries a day. ""Not all translate into clients who actually visit the properties, though."" Anyone shopping for an island needs to understand that it's not always smooth sailing. Some clients buy an island, and then put the ""for sale"" sign back up a year later because it is found to be difficult to maintain, or just too isolated, Mr. Krolow said. Also, landing development permission for an undeveloped island can take far longer than expected. For many people, though, buying an island is not about the cost. ""They want to be steward of their own little piece of the world,"" Mr. Krolow explained. ""They become so emotionally attached to the idea of owning an island. It's not simply a luxury purchase. It's a very passionate one."" Other warm climes where affluent buyers are dipping their toes include the emerging areas of the Southern Zone in Costa Rica and the Pacific Riviera, along Nicaragua's southern Pacific coast. ""In Costa Rica's Southern Zone, you can buy an ocean view lot for $90,000-100,000 and build a custom home for $100 per square foot,"" said Margaret Summerfield, a global real estate expert who reports on real estate trends for InternationalLiving.com and The Pathfinder Alert. ""In Nicaragua, you can buy a large ocean view lot in a private community for $90,000-100,000 and build a custom home."" Ambergris Caye, the largest island in Belize, is another undervalued market that is drawing prosperous Americans, according to Kathleen Peddicord, publisher of Live and Invest Overseas and author of ""How to Buy Real Estate Overseas."" ""Belize is easy to get to from the U.S., has the Caribbean soft white sands and azure water, and is less developed than other Caribbean markets,"" she said. ""Plus, there's a friendly community of expats.""

Elsewhere, a yearning for the old sod has been luring deep-pocketed buyers to Ireland and Scotland. An increasing number of Americans with Irish roots are buying castles and manor houses at rock-bottom prices -- with cash. ""We've had a surge of Americans looking to buy historic homes in Ireland in the last year,"" said Roseanne De Vere Hunt, head of residential and country properties at Ganly Walters in Dublin. In Ireland, many of the homes are changing hands for roughly a third of 2007 levels because of fire sales by developers, many of which failed when the market crumpled. And a growing number of Americans are shopping for Parisian townhouses and centuries-old chateaus in the French countryside. ""It's the first time in years that prices have come down, and sellers are truly willing to negotiate directly with buyers,"" Ms. Peddicord said. ""You don't buy a French chateau, however, because you're sensible,"" said Elizabeth Bonner, 57, a resident of Gulf Stream, Fla., who owns the 18th-century Chateau de Courtomer, initially purchased for about $2.6 million in 2005. The chateau is in Courtomer, a village in the Normandy countryside about 100 miles northwest of Paris. Mrs. Bonner has spent the last eight years renovating it slowly, making the 38 rooms and about 17,500 square feet livable.

Chateaus currently on the market generally range from EUR1.5 million, or around $2 million, to more than EUR3.7 million, or roughly $5 million, according to Patricia Hawkes, a Paris-based real estate agent and co-owner of the Philip Hawkes Agency, which specializes in historical French high-end properties. Mrs. Hawkes and her husband have operated an agency for nearly 40 years and sold hundreds of chateaus along the way, she estimated. They even own one themselves, the 14th- and 18th-century Chateau de Missery in Burgundy. ""In the last year, we've seen a definite increase in interest from American buyers,"" Mrs. Hawkes said. ""Of course, Americans have always had a love affair with France, but right now the French are in a real muddle, mostly with the tax situation, and many owners are eager to sell."" As a result, prices have slipped, sometimes strikingly, from the pie-in-the-sky levels of years past. ""Many of these chateaus have been on the market for quite some time,"" Mrs. Hawkes said. ""It's not unusual to be able to negotiate for at least 20 percent off the original asking price, and some are down by half."" The appeal isn't surprising, she said. ""A chateau is a work of art,"" Mrs. Hawkes said. ""The only thing is, you can't move it."" There are some financial considerations, of course. In addition to property tax, nonresidents pay an annual wealth tax on a property, unless they are exempt under a tax treaty. Rates are progressive, from 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent, according to Deloitte. While buyers are picking up prestige properties for sentimental reasons, many certainly see the business side of renting them out when they are not in residence.","When wealthy Americans look for property abroad, the Caribbean is the top draw, but many corners of the world are fair game.",9aedc32d-1d76-56a6-a08f-34b552724ae3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/11/business/11ABROAD1_SPAN/ABROAD1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=dc61e0f75517f20fbef523131554a831ef56cffa49de272986b4665a79af4302&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"A wind sock and wooden dock indicate the airport on Musha Cay, an island in the Exuma chain of the Bahamas that is owned by the magician David Copperfield.",9aedc32d-1d76-56a6-a08f-34b552724ae3,N24News/imgs/9aedc32d-1d76-56a6-a08f-34b552724ae3.jpg,21
Economy,"California Labor Bill, Near Passage, Is Blow to Uber and Lyft",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/09/business/economy/uber-lyft-california.html,"SACRAMENTO -- A pack of Teamsters fanned out through California's Capitol building last week, marching into legislators' offices and pressing them to pass a bill that would force Uber and Lyft to treat their drivers as employees. The measure, Assembly Bill 5, would entitle gig workers to protections like a minimum wage and unemployment benefits. ""Yes on A.B. 5! Yes on A.B. 5!"" they chorused. The push was one of several door-knocking campaigns coordinated by labor groups that can now taste success after battling the ride-hailing companies for years. The bill is intended to codify and extend a 2018 California Supreme Court ruling that put forth a new test for classifying workers. Under that test, workers are far more likely to be deemed employees if they perform a function central to a company's business. Legislators are expected to pass the bill before their session ends this week, presenting the strongest challenge yet to Uber and Lyft's business model, which relies on a corps of drivers who can be enlisted and deployed essentially as freelancers.

The measure could affect millions of Californians beyond ride-hail drivers, including janitors, nail salon workers and cable-television installers. And it would give momentum to an emerging consensus on the center-left that workers are entitled to a basic level of economic security that many Americans now live without. Several candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination have endorsed the bill, including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg. ""It's hugely important because California is the birthplace and the center of app-based work, and because California has traditionally been a bellwether for the country around a lot of different progressive policies,"" said Rebecca Smith, an expert on worker misclassification at the National Employment Law Project, which is part of a coalition seeking to enact a similar law in New York.

Industry officials have estimated that on-demand companies like Uber and the delivery service DoorDash see their costs rise 20 to 30 percent when they rely on employees rather than contractors, and Uber and Lyft have said in statements to prospective investors that being forced to make drivers employees could significantly affect their financial outlook. Since the prospect of a deal started to fade in late July, the stock prices of both Uber and Lyft have declined about 30 percent. Analysts said the stock decline was due in part to concerns about A.B. 5, among other worries about the businesses. ""Probably the No. 1 question we get from investors right now is about the risks here, qualitatively and quantitatively,"" said Lloyd Walmsley, an equity research analyst at Deutsche Bank. ""There's obviously the risk that California is just the beginning, that other states could follow suit.""

Ride-hailing companies contend that A.B. 5 would force them to set rigid schedules, depriving drivers of flexibility, and raise fares to cover the cost of employment benefits. The companies say that about 90 percent of their drivers nationwide do not work a full-time schedule. But Tyler Sandness, a Lyft driver who is an organizer for a group called Rideshare Drivers United in Los Angeles, said the bill was needed because ""things have gone from bad to worse"" for drivers. As independent contractors, drivers must cover the costs of vehicle ownership and payroll taxes, and lack much of the safety net afforded to employees, including workers' compensation and paid sick leave. That California has come to the brink of fundamentally threatening such marquee companies is the culmination of miscalculations by Uber and Lyft, a strong show of force from organized labor, and legislators' resistance to the intervention of the new governor, Gavin Newsom. The ride-hailing companies sought an amendment to the bill that would create a special category for their drivers, between contractor and employee. Mr. Newsom's office would not comment for this article, but three people familiar with the discussions said the governor gave the companies clear advice: Get labor to bless such an arrangement, or face insurmountable opposition in Sacramento.

The companies turned their attention away from lobbying against the bill in the Legislature in favor of laying the groundwork for a deal. They conferred frequently with the governor's staff, according to legislative aides. And they met more than half a dozen times during the first half of the year with representatives from a few large unions, including the Service Employees International Union and the Teamsters, two people familiar with the discussions said. Some labor leaders felt that a deal could leave drivers for ride-hailing services with many of the employment protections under A.B. 5 while allowing them to join a labor organization, potentially expanding the unions' ranks by tens of thousands.

* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The negotiations appeared to make progress. Two weeks after the bill passed the state's lower house in late May, Uber's chief executive and Lyft's co-founders wrote a commentary for The San Francisco Chronicle laying out the terms of a possible agreement along these lines. Uber and Lyft executives believed that a deal was near and some discussed how to sell it to the Legislature, according to two industry officials.

But opposition that had been simmering for months within the labor movement soon began boiling over, prompting the service employees' union and the Teamsters to first delay and then pull out of a meeting planned for July. Labor officials used a four-week recess beginning in mid-July to consolidate opposition to any agreement watering down A.B. 5 for gig workers. The state's building trades council, which represents construction workers, worried that exempting Uber and Lyft would pave the way for exemptions in other industries, including their own. The council sent a letter to the governor stating its opposition and urged other unions to join it. Within a few weeks, several other unions followed suit. The governor's office persisted. Mr. Newsom's chief of staff, Ann O'Leary, a former top adviser to Hillary Clinton, had lunch with John Zimmer, the president of Lyft, and Tony West, Uber's chief legal officer, to keep the discussions alive, according to people associated with all the parties. Aides to the governor also began calling legislators like Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, the A.B. 5 sponsor, to gauge her openness to a deal. ""He absolutely wanted a compromise,"" Ms. Gonzalez said of the governor. ""I was very clear at that moment that I wasn't looking to sell out workers.""

After the Legislature returned in mid-August, there appeared to be one last chance for a breakthrough -- not by carving Uber and Lyft out of the legislation, but by enacting a separate bill that would override portions of A.B. 5. A top state labor official circulated to colleagues an updated ""rough concept draft"" that could leave drivers short of full employee status, but give them a union that would bargain industrywide with the companies over wages and benefits and even allow them to strike. The last week in August, a proposal from Uber with many of the same features was relayed to the State Senate's bill writers. Lyft had put forth similar ideas.

To nudge forward unions that might be reluctant to endorse a deal they privately favored, Uber and Lyft announced that they would each kick in $30 million for a state ballot initiative next year to try to exempt their drivers from employment status if legislators didn't do it first. The governor appeared to pressure labor as well. The head of the state building trades labor council, Robbie Hunter, said he was left off a high-profile commission to study the future of work after receiving an invitation from the governor's office. Mr. Hunter attributed the snub to his insistence on full employment status for gig workers. ""I was stunned,"" Mr. Hunter said. ""I do believe they thought I was going to change."" He did not. On Labor Day, Mr. Newsom appeared to concede that the bill would pass without significant alterations for gig workers, and he endorsed A.B. 5 for the first time. But he urged the companies and labor officials to continue discussing ways ""to build paths for workers in our state who want to join a union."" An Uber spokesman, Matt Kallman, said on Monday: ""We've engaged in good faith with the Legislature, the Newsom administration and labor leaders for nearly a year on this issue, and we believe California is missing a real opportunity to lead the nation."" In some ways, the fight may have only begun, with Uber and Lyft likely to keep pushing for a separate measure scaling back some of A.B. 5's impact in exchange for granting drivers the right to bargain with the companies. Anthony Foxx, Lyft's chief policy officer, said, ""We remain hopeful of reaching a solution that is good for drivers and builds a strong bridge with labor."" Such a bill could emerge from the Legislature next year. ""A.B. 5 is going to pass,"" said State Senator Scott Wiener of San Francisco, Uber and Lyft's hometown, who supports the bill. ""But I'm confident this issue will be active in the Legislature for years to come.""",The companies seem to have fallen short in efforts to dodge legislation classifying many workers in the gig economy as employees and not contractors.,bc5f342f-217f-5183-b39a-4aa9245dd935,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/09/business/09gigwork3/09gig3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=5cac1e56169790fa577121295f09ce55aab0d14e6a1aae5acacedd4b029499a4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Drivers for ride-hailing services demonstrating outside Uber headquarters in San Francisco last month.

Media,"As New Year's Eve Ball Drops, the Free Press Gets a Moment in the Spotlight",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/30/business/media/2019-new-years-eve-times-square-journalists.html,"As New Year's Eve Ball Drops, the Free Press Gets a Moment in the Spotlight

Television viewers on New Year's Eve tune in for performances by the latest hitmakers and nostalgia acts. This time around, 11 journalists -- ranging from familiar faces like Martha Raddatz of ABC to behind-the-scenes editors like Karen Toulon of Bloomberg News -- shared the Times Square limelight, part of an effort by organizers to recognize the erosion of press freedoms at home and abroad. The journalists were tasked Monday with pressing the crystal button that initiates the minute-long descent of the New Year's Eve Ball, a prime moment on a night that attracts tens of millions of viewers. Just before they pressed it, the journalists gathered around the button, cheering and waving to the crowd before bringing the ball down. Among those invited was Karen Attiah, who edited the Washington Post columns of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi dissident and American resident who was murdered in Turkey this year by Saudi agents; Mr. Holt of NBC; Alisyn Camerota of CNN; Vladimir Duthiers of CBS; and Jon Scott, a weekend anchor on Fox News.

Editors from Time, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times were also on the bill, along with Maria Ressa, a journalist in the Philippines whose news site, Rappler, has been threatened by the country's authoritarian president, Rodrigo Duterte. Ms. Ressa, along with Mr. Khashoggi, was featured on the cover of Time this month for its annual person of the year honor.

The reporters and editors were part of broadcasts featuring stars like John Legend, Shawn Mendes, Jennifer Lopez, Bebe Rexha, Sting and a reunited New Kids on the Block. Journalists do not carry quite the same star power as past honorees, like Muhammad Ali or Lady Gaga, who memorably kissed the mayor at the time, Michael R. Bloomberg, in the first moments of 2012. But even a brief recognition from viewers will go a long way, said Joel Simon, the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a nonprofit group that promotes press rights and helped coordinate the event.

""People who are watching across the country will see the media together, standing on the stage, visually united behind this principle,"" Mr. Simon said in an interview. ""That's a positive message at a time when journalists around the world are threatened as never before.""

Tim Tompkins, the president of the Times Square Alliance, has sought in recent years to leverage the ball drop's worldwide audience to promote civic causes. Tarana Burke, the founder of the #MeToo movement, appeared onstage last year. David Miliband, who runs the International Rescue Committee, a humanitarian aid group for refugees, was a guest on Dec. 31, 2014.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. This year's idea came about after a conversation between Mr. Tompkins and an acquaintance from his college days, Jacob Weisberg, a former editor in chief of Slate and a Committee to Protect Journalists board member.

""The two pictures that are sent around the world generally are people kissing each other with confetti falling and the people who appear on the stage,"" Mr. Tompkins said. ""We wanted to use that in a deliberate way."" ""It's fitting to celebrate the free press as we reflect on where we've been during the past year and what we value most as a society,"" he added. Given the attention span of viewers on a night dedicated more to carousing than to the Constitution, Mr. Simon said the televised image of journalists, representing a range of news organizations, would be a potent symbol. ""You have to send a simple and essentially visual message,"" he said. ""The basic principles of press freedom are unifying, and it's something that people can celebrate even if they have divergent views.""",The Times Square Alliance joined with the Committee to Protect Journalists to send millions of viewers a message on the importance of journalism.,6a2b5247-8bf5-548e-80ef-3196e46497dd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/31/business/31balldrop1-print/31balldrop1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=84d10f9b9bf408650a3aa523364bfe785a33cf523e0f1d1a10f0d96050bb20af&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"New Year's Eve in Times Square two years ago.

Economy,"Fed Prepares for Change in Policy, and in Policy Makers",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/business/economy/fed-prepares-for-change-in-policy-and-in-policy-makers.html,"WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials, who have made clear that they intend to cut back on the Fed's monthly asset purchases by the end of the year, must decide next week whether it is time to tap the brakes or better to wait another month or two. The far thornier challenge they face is convincing markets that the Fed remains committed to its broader effort to stimulate the economy even as it begins to pull back from the most visible component of that campaign -- and even though as many as nine of the 12 voting members of the Fed's policy-making committee may be replaced in the next year. Most notably, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed's chairman, is expected to step down at the end of January; the person President Obama is widely expected to nominate in his place, Lawrence H. Summers, has said little about monetary policy in recent years. Fed officials are concerned that the markets will misinterpret the introduction of tapering, as the impending move is popularly known, as a sign of a broader retreat. They are expected to discuss ways of reinforcing the Fed's continuing determination to encourage economic activity and job creation when the Federal Open Market Committee meets here Tuesday and Wednesday.

""The overwhelming incentive at this meeting is to dull the hawkish effects of tapering with more dovish communication,"" wrote Eric Green, head of rates, foreign exchange and commodities research at TD Securities. The Fed's message, he said, ""has been ill defined and not internally consistent. The good news is that the F.O.M.C. has the opportunity to improve on that message."" The Fed under Mr. Bernanke has struggled for much of the last five years to find new ways of stimulating the economy beyond its base-line commitment since December 2008 to hold short-term interest rates near zero. Last year, officials announced an aggressive combination of asset purchases and forward guidance, both tied to improvement in the labor market. The Fed said it would buy $85 billion a month in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities to jump-start job growth, and keep short-term rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate was above 6.5 percent. It was 7.3 percent in August. In June, however, Mr. Bernanke surprised many investors by announcing that the Fed intended to reduce the volume of monthly purchases by the end of the year, and to end the purchases entirely by the middle of next year. An official account of the committee's most recent meeting in July affirmed that ""almost all participants"" favored Mr. Bernanke's timetable, provided that ""economic conditions improved broadly as expected."" Investors have started to demand higher interest rates, driving up borrowing costs, and critics warn the Fed is pulling back too soon. The unemployment rate is down from 8.1 percent in August 2012, just before the Fed started the expansion of its bond portfolio. But roughly half the decline happened because more adults were not even trying to find jobs. The share of adults with jobs, down sharply during the recession, has yet to recover any of its losses.

Fed officials have emphasized in response that their policy decisions are forward-looking. Changes in monetary policy seep slowly through the economy -- from the Fed through the banks into the decision-making of business and individual borrowers -- and Fed officials have said they are convinced the economy will not need as much help in the next few years. Mr. Bernanke and his allies also face mounting pressure from internal critics who worry the modest benefits of asset purchases increasingly are outweighed by the risk that continued expansion of the Fed's holdings will disrupt financial markets -- by encouraging speculation, by limiting the availability of some kinds of securities or by seeding inflation. Many analysts predict that proponents of bond buying, also known as quantitative easing, will agree to cut the volume of monthly purchases initially by a small amount, perhaps as little as $10 billion. ""Concerns about the cost of Q.E. have reached a tipping point for the F.O.M.C., and Q.E. tapering will start even though the economic recovery remains tepid,"" wrote Kevin Logan, chief United States economist at HSBC Securities. Mr. Logan had predicted the change would happen in December, but said comments by Fed officials persuaded him September was more likely. A small reduction in bond purchases should have little economic impact, but investors took Mr. Bernanke's comments in June as evidence the Fed might begin to raise rates sooner than they had expected. The Fed has sought to stimulate the economy by persuading investors to trust that rates will remain near zero for years to come. Inevitably, investors are skittish about any sign that the Fed may change its mind. And uncertainty about the Fed's plans has been compounded by the impending shake-up of the Fed's policy-making committee. Four of the 12 voters on the Fed's policy-making committee are replaced each year through a rotation of the presidents of the regional reserve banks. Unusually, as many as five of the seven governors may also be replaced.

Elizabeth A. Duke stepped down at the end of August. Sarah Bloom Raskin has been nominated as deputy Treasury secretary. Jerome H. Powell's term ends at the same time as Mr. Bernanke's, although the White House might decide to leave Mr. Powell, a Republican, in place. And Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's vice chairwoman, is seen as unlikely to remain if she is passed over in favor of Mr. Summers. Fed officials have discussed a number of options to reassure investors. The Fed has said it intends to hold short-term rates near zero at least as long as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent and inflation remains under control. Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, wants to reduce the threshold to 5.5 percent. Other Fed officials, seeking to preserve flexibility, prefer the softer approach of emphasizing that 6.5 percent is a threshold, not a target. ""I can easily envision certain circumstances in which the unemployment rate could go below 6 percent before we moved the funds rate up,"" Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said in a speech earlier this month. Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, suggested the Fed should address how quickly it expects to raise rates once that process begins, by estimating the level of future short-term rates. ""Markets and the public are likely having a difficult time understanding exactly how fast the F.O.M.C. is likely to raise interest rates after the first rate hike,"" she said.",The Federal Reserve is trying to reassure investors about its effort to stimulate the economy as it prepares a shake-up of its policy-making committee.,ea19e5f6-1b78-542d-9b99-bf790eaabf7d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/13/business/Fedjp/Fedjp-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=322&w=600&s=957d1ddddf1043b3d9e9a9b80376f922d68e1f19127dfe6d415e326385d585c3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,A meeting of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors in July.

Travel,An Adirondack Wilderness All Your Own,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/travel/an-adirondack-wilderness-all-your-own.html,"Moments after parking our car and loading into a compact, one-propeller bush plane, my three friends and I were looking down at a lush boreal landscape, newly green after the long winter. The view of soft, wooded peaks interspersed with creeks and lakes extended as far as we could see, evoking the northern territories of Canada or Alaska. But what lay below us was closer to home: the heart of the Adirondack Mountains in upstate New York, its vast wooded expanse concealing the isolated campsite where we would ensconce ourselves.

The campsites they service cannot be formally reserved and are available for free on a first-come-first-served basis, but the pilots keep a diligent calendar of which ones are open. In years past, many of the pilots have even helped the state steward the campsites, flying in supplies and occasionally helping stock certain varieties of hatchery-raised fish ahead of the fishing season. They also supply paddles and life jackets for those who want to use the canoes that are stashed in the various camping areas, a practice that is officially frowned on by the park. That the four of us could drive from our scattered homes and have an entire lake to ourselves is a testament to the remarkable success of New York state's preservation movement. Ironically, though, the efforts that have made this singular experience possible have also taken a toll on the floatplane pilots who enable people like us to disconnect from the world. Before 1972, commercial floatplanes were allowed to land on 57 bodies of water across the region, offering a wealth of options for visitors looking for solitude. Since then, the state has reclassified broad tracts in the park as ""wilderness,"" a designation that prohibits the presence of motorized vehicles. Today, floatplanes are permitted on just 15 lakes and ponds in sections of the preserve designated as ""wild forest,"" and only six fall in the immediate vicinity of Long Lake.

Days before our flight, our pilot pointed us toward Pine Lake, a small, forked pool in a newly incorporated section of the park that the state acquired in 2013. The parcel of land that encompasses Pine Lake was previously owned by the paper company Finch, Pruyn, once the largest private landowner in New York state. But today, gaps and logging roads where timber was harvested years ago have mostly filled in, leaving seamless stands of old, soaring trees, resplendently reflected in the water. Our campsite fell just east of Raquette Lake, around which the titans of the Gilded Age once built sprawling summer estates at the turn of the century. Camp Uncas, once owned by J.P. Morgan, and Great Camp Sagamore, the former stamping grounds of Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt and his relatives, are both situated on their own small lakes some 20 miles away, nearly indistinguishable from the lake we set up camp on. Our much humbler site was also alongside the Cedar River, which we could hear flowing through gentle, nearby rapids before the river bends east and empties into the Hudson four miles downstream.

But these momentary nuisances are offset by the divine things, like the calls of loons and hoot owls we heard at nightfall, and the perfect clarity of the night sky, unspoiled by artificial light pollution. These conditions only improve deeper into the summer and autumn, as the water warms up enough to swim and the northern foliage takes on early fall hues. Small natural mysteries are always a source of intrigue as well. Besides the birds, each evening after dark we heard a sequence of heavy splashes from the water that resonated like giants' steps or small boulders falling from above, often coming too close for comfort. It wasn't until we arrived back in town and talked to locals that we discovered the origin of the sounds: slaps of a beaver's tail.

Not only does the floatplane open up isolated sites that often don't connect to established hiking trails, but it also makes the experience feasible for almost any traveler. Other than the tediousness of getting out of the plane, which sometimes involves wading to shore, it is a straightforward journey doable for most people of any age. And while the environs are primitive, the usual restraints campers face with regard to the weight and size of their gear don't apply when flying in. On my first trip by floatplane six summers ago, my father brought a cooler stocked with butter and pancake makings, intent on recreating a boyhood memory of watching a more fortunate family indulge in flapjacks and maple syrup in the Allagash wilderness in Maine. Over the years, my experiences with cooking have grown more ambitious. This year, my friends and I armed ourselves with a variety of heavy equipment such as a steel fire-top grill and a cast iron pan, things that minimalists might consider extravagant, but that open all sorts of culinary possibilities. But even with the freedom to attempt wilder feats of campfire gastronomy, we opted for a vegetarian menu of egg and potato scrambles, grilled cheese sandwiches, three-bean chili, and roasted vegetables, followed by beers and spirits after dinner.",Splendid isolation in upstate New York's vast forest is just a floatplane ride away.,f5868f92-6c8f-5a66-bad0-0fb0058a58d3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/22/travel/22Adirondacks1/22Adirondacks1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=ea164ae6b61bca0d5300aa9effd531cac56951a39be381892fe7293101c9275e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A floatplane arrives at the isolated Pine Lake camping site in the Adirondacks.,f5868f92-6c8f-5a66-bad0-0fb0058a58d3,N24News/imgs/f5868f92-6c8f-5a66-bad0-0fb0058a58d3.jpg,4
Automobiles,Video Review: Not-So-Standard Equipment on the Otherwise Standard Corolla,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/automobiles/autoreviews/toyota-corolla.html,"The popular Corolla has long provided basic transportation, but there is nothing basic about the safety technology that now comes standard.

I first experienced radar-assisted cruise control in a $70,000 Mercedes in 2001. Slowing automatically to keep from hitting the car ahead felt like a magic trick. In 2009, I was told to drive a new $50,000 Volvo into the back of a ""parked car"" (really, an inflatable mock-up). Every fiber of my body wanted to stomp on the brake pedal. Instead, the car did it for me. Automatic braking is mind-bending the first time. Both of these technologies are standard equipment on s, which start at $19,385. So is lane-keeping assist, which nudges the car back between the road stripes if you wander. Automatic high-beam headlamps, too. A number of mainstream automotive brands now offer valuable safety technology once exclusive to premium makes. Often, they are option packages or part of higher trim levels. Toyota is putting Toyota Safety Sense, or T.S.S., on many of its passenger cars as standard equipment. This, as Martha Stewart would say, is a good thing. Just make sure you understand which T.S.S. you are getting.

The tested Corolla sedan gets T.S.S.-P., which provides automatic braking with pedestrian detection, adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist and automatic high beams. Buyers wanting the more practical Corolla iM hatchback get T.S.S.-C., which lacks radar cruise control and the pedestrian detection part of the auto-braking system. There is more legalese in Toyota's T.S.S. literature than ""O""s in a box of Froot Loops, but here is what to expect: Auto braking (called a precollision system by Toyota) operates at 7 to 110 miles per hour. When detecting cars, it can reduce the speed by up to 25 m.p.h. Pedestrian detection works from 7 to 50 m.p.h. reducing speed by up to 19 m.p.h. In general, the adaptive cruise control works from 25 to 110 m.p.h. The biggest surprise in these numbers is that a Corolla can actually go that fast. This technology is not the grade found in premium brands. For now, Corolla's adaptive cruise control doesn't keep pace in stop-and-go traffic, but it should reduce dented fenders, bumpers and skulls. That is a good start and will probably help to sell this car, which rides on an architecture that is about 10 years old.

But other than the high tech, the Corolla as an automobile is basic transportation. It runs with a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine that delivers 132 horsepower and 128 pound-feet of torque. The Eco model has 8 additional horsepower. The transmission is continuously variable with steering wheel paddle shifters that provide surprisingly crisp simulated gearshifts. There is also a sport mode, but don't fall for that promise. The safety technology may calm the spirit, but Corolla's driving dynamics will not stir the soul. It accelerates and stops just fine for a budget car. Drivers may often be making small course corrections when cruising. There is little road feel and the tires and suspension don't handle bumps in a calming way. The continuously variable transmission has the elastic feeling common to continuously variable transmissions. For engaging handling or refinement in this size, go with the Honda Civic, Chevy Cruze, Hyundai Elantra or Mazda 3. On average, the Environmental Protection Agency rates Corolla's fuel economy average at 32 miles per gallon. That is about what I saw. The cabin looks fine for a modestly priced car. There is a lot of hard plastic to rub elbows with and the hide on the seats is clearly synthetic but it's probably durable for the long haul. That is the point of a Corolla. At $23,545 as tested, the XSE model has automatic climate control and heated seats. A backup camera is standard equipment (that is something the luxury brands could learn from), and the controls are straightforward down to the basic touch-screen interface. No Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, if that is a deal breaker. There is room for two full-size adults in back, three if they are skinny. The trunk has the space of some midsize sedans. A folding split back seat lets long boxes of Ikea furniture ride along. In the looks department, Corolla has a pleasant enough profile, with a crisp shoulder line near the rear pillar. The scowl of the redesigned front end resembles Darth Vader's mask. You half expect to hear the sound of a respirator.

Automobile enthusiasts often sneer at the appliance that is Corolla. But some people simply need the luxury of a car, not a prestige automobile. There are many single parents who require affordable wheels with a three-year warranty. That is the kind of security used cars don't offer. Plus, there is peace of mind in the electronic nannies. The auto braking and lane keeping features aren't a license to text and drive. It is important for drivers to remain engaged since it takes only a few seconds of distraction for things to go seriously wrong. It would be helpful to outfit all vehicles with safety tech like T.S.S.-P. for unexpected moments. Toyota has made lifesaving features affordable. Now, how about adding some life to Corolla's personality?",Toyota is adding lifesaving technology to the 2017 sedan and many of its other passenger cars.,9afe8761-e00e-5335-a111-41b700ae456b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/17/automobiles/autoreviews/17driven/driven1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=6c7e035cd9ebc4d2b6cf833887925aee21d932cbdc7cb3ed99626203eabdeb96&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,2017 Toyota Corolla,9afe8761-e00e-5335-a111-41b700ae456b,N24News/imgs/9afe8761-e00e-5335-a111-41b700ae456b.jpg,23
Automobiles,"The Ecstasy of Excess, the Agony of the Sticker",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/automobiles/autoreviews/the-ecstasy-of-excess-the-agony-of-the-sticker.html,"BIG SUR, Calif. -- Every carmaker makes compromises. Feature enhancements, like a little more legroom or a touch more horsepower, are weighed against the effect on a model's sticker price. But what if, in an alternative universe, money could bend the laws of physics, and vehicles were created only to transport mortals to the highest state of driving satisfaction? I pondered this at the Post Ranch Inn here, as a waiter poured a Thai herb broth -- infused with lemon grass and galangal root -- from a laboratory-style beaker over a single raw wild spot prawn, cooking it directly on the plate. I had arrived at the trendy resort perched above the Pacific Ocean in a $372,324 2014 Rolls-Royce Wraith, the most powerful Rolls ever produced. The Wraith is the automotive equivalent of molecular gastronomy, the cuisine that scientifically transforms familiar ingredients into otherworldly dishes. It is excruciating, elite and outrageously delicious. Before that moment at Post Ranch, I had never tasted -- really tasted -- a prawn. And my sense of what a vehicle can provide in terms of acceleration, cabin comfort and exacting design was fundamentally altered by several days spent driving the Wraith along the coast. The car's name, inspired by a soul-sucking ghost that casts spells and cannot be vanquished, is apropos.

Start with the whimsical touches in keeping with Rolls-Royce tradition. A crystal rotary controller at the driver's hand raises and lowers the flying lady statuette, the Spirit of Ecstasy, that graces the bonnet. Perhaps it's her voice, proper yet sultry, that provides the Wraith's turn-by-turn navigation voice guidance. Or is it a princess? Of course, there are the requisite his-and-hers three-foot umbrellas that spring from the door jambs with the push of a button. There is the lamb's wool that lines the floor of the cabin and boot, warm and soft underfoot when you slip off your loafers. But the signature feature is the Wraith's Starlight Headliner, consisting of 1,340 LEDs hand-sewn to create an effect of owning one's personal night sky filled with stars, the luminosity controlled by the driver. ""Because each optical fiber is cut by hand at a slightly different depth, each star has its own intensity,"" said Phil Harnett, the Wraith's product manager. ""So it looks like a real night sky."" The made-by-hand feature takes four days, and though it is the Wraith's most expensive stand-alone option at $12,925, it is one of the most popular. ""Due to demand, we had to look for another poor unfortunate soul to help the four guys who are doing the work,"" Mr. Harnett said. Who are the buyers creating this newfound job market for LED headliner stitches? ""It's no longer the Wall Street or real estate guys buying these in the U.S.,"" said James Warren, the company's communications manager for Britain and Scandinavia. ""It's the sickeningly clever and very wealthy, and really cool, pioneering dot-com guys, blokes in their late 20s and early 30s.""

Mr. Warren said that some of these early buyers were already talking about buying a second Rolls in the form of the more traditional limo-style Phantom or Ghost models. ""They just love jumping into the Wraith at the house in Malibu for a weekend blast,"" he said. ""But they wouldn't mind sitting in the Ghost during the week and tapping away at the laptop."" Well, Silicon Valley zillionaires, gag me with a silver spoon. While the Wraith is derived from the Ghost sedan, the fastback design creates an undeniably dashing profile. But at first I questioned the adoption of rear-hinged cabin doors on a 17-foot-long coupe weighing 5,380 pounds. The doors are big and heavy enough to be used on a bank vault and close with the same resolve. Fortunately, buttons on the front windshield pillars control the door with electronic precision. If seated in the rear, you'll have to make an undignified lunge to reach those controls -- or wait for a servant to release you. The doors, and the absence of a center roof pillar, create a wide opening, although the driver and front passenger must slide forward to allow entry to the back seat. Within a day, I realized that despite their considerable weight, the suicide doors were an absolute necessity. They make every step in or out of the Wraith a dramatic event for passengers, and a reason for roadside spectators to gawk. That's the idea, right? What I never doubted for a moment, and weeks later remains the Wraith's most indelible impression, is the Empire-size powertrain. The ability for this beast of a car to go from a standstill to 60 miles per hour in 4.4 seconds, or to reach a maximum speed of 155 m.p.h., is almost beside the point. It's the inexhaustibility of the acceleration that knocked off my Argyle socks. The sleek look and bounteous power give the Wraith a youthful edge over other Rolls models. ""We had to power up our 6.6-liter twin-turbo V12,"" said Mr. Harnett, noting that changing the intake and exhaust tuning helped to wring 60 more horses out of the engine, bringing the total horsepower to 624. Peak torque was increased to 590 pound-feet over a broad range of engine speeds, from 1,500 to 5,500 r.p.m. The Wraith is not meant to be an agile sports car. Instead, the brute force of its engine, the relaxed yet alert response from steering wheel movements and the syrupy 8-speed transmission combine to make the driving experience effortless. The Wraith is not about feeling the road. It's about owning it. Close those Bank of England doors, and the Wraith and its passengers are hermetically sealed from any world outside its own existence. The transitions from one gear to the next are imperceptible unless you mash the accelerator to the floor. In that event, the engine doesn't roar or rumble so much as it gently vibrates in low hushed tones.

Driving at 65 m.p.h. felt like crawling. That's why I relied on cruise control for long highway stretches. I've driven other cars with adaptive cruise control, a radar-based system that reduces the speed of a vehicle when the car ahead slows down. But the Wraith's cruising system -- borrowed from the tech labs of BMW, Rolls's parent company -- was much more effective, bringing the vehicle to a complete stop for as long as the car in front was halted, waiting as attentively as a hunting hound and springing back to action when traffic started to move again. The technology sharing between BMW and Rolls-Royce is reciprocal. The engineers in England developed the Wraith's Satellite Aided Transmission, which uses GPS-based data to anticipate the need for gear shifts before the road climbs or turns. Mr. Harnett likened the technology to other perks of the one percent: ""The satellite data transmission is basically doing everything for you, in an incredibly subtle and aiding way, like a perfect butler or valet will take care of you as a person,"" he said. The technology could one day be shared with BMW vehicles. The Wraith has enough high-tech wizardry to make Hogwarts administrators envious. The list includes a night-vision camera and high beams that automatically engage when the coast is clear. But designers have also left tangible analog features for hands to touch, from 1930s-style radio buttons to organ-stop manual plungers that let you precisely control the flow of air in the cabin. ""There is still a relevance and place for the haptic reassurance of touching a beautiful material, or playing with the nice knurling on the bezel, or fettling with a knob that's beautifully weighted,"" Alex Innes, Rolls's bespoke designer, said in a telephone interview. It's hard not to be impressed with the careful consideration of every element -- down to the self-righting wheel centers that always display the Rolls-Royce logo upright. Heaven forbid they should spin like a common clothes dryer. But those features, many of them handcrafted, and the exorbitant price, create a conundrum. One can't help but play the game of searching high and low for the slightest flaws. You could argue, for instance, that the car's length makes it unwieldy for city maneuvers and parking. And you could certainly criticize the Wraith's fuel-thirsty ways. I managed 14 miles per gallon in combined city-highway driving, and 17 m.p.g. for my concluding trip down the coast to Southern California to return the car. The official federal rating is 13 m.p.g. in town and 21 on the highway, earning the Wraith a $1,700 gas guzzler tax.

When Rolls-Royce granted me the Wraith test car with the provision that I drive it from the Bay Area to Los Angeles in time for the opening of the auto show there, I knew immediately whom I wanted as my co-pilot. Six weeks earlier my dear friend Jack Tuller underwent his second operation to remove a brain tumor. Miraculously, he emerged from surgery with his charm and good spirit, but without his ability to drive. As a result, Jack often feels deprived of mobility. So he jumped at the opportunity for the road trip, especially since the route included majestic Highways 1 and 101. On the 10-hour drive, which flew by in what seemed like minutes, we got into a deep discussion. Jack has come to regard the removal of part of his brain as the cleaving away of many superficial things in his life. I suppose you could include a showy luxury vehicle, so far beyond the reach of most mortals, among those things. But the Wraith's craftsmanship and prowess managed to suppress our impulse to ridicule. The car is the very embodiment of excess, yet ultimately we felt fortunate to be among the few people to experience it, particularly on such a spectacular drive. At one point, Jack, who too often these days can't access the names of familiar things, deftly summed up the experience. ""I know it's just a car,"" he said. ""But when you're driving a Rolls-Royce, it makes you feel good about your life.""","The Roll-Royce Wraith, derived from the Ghost sedan, offers an almost $400,000 driving experience that seems to avoid compromises.",8f0162cc-13cd-5ea1-9e5f-08a2015be0e8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/26/automobiles/Wheel1/Wheel1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=305&w=600&s=1d4f9af5be7655d883b9279934805e12921953af75f1ac38be45939511b39b96&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"The Rolls-Royce Wraith near Half Moon Bay, Calif.",8f0162cc-13cd-5ea1-9e5f-08a2015be0e8,N24News/imgs/8f0162cc-13cd-5ea1-9e5f-08a2015be0e8.jpg,23
Travel,Searching for a River to Skate Away On,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/travel/vermont-ice-skating-joyce-maynard.html,"Ever since I first read ""Hans Brinker, or the Silver Skates,"" I dreamed of taking off across a natural body of frozen water. Every winter of the last half century I've sought out that elusive miracle of nature: good ice. Lake or pond ice or a frozen river. The real thing. Last winter, I found it. Lake Morey -- on whose shores Vermont's Lake Morey Resort has sat since 1905 -- offers what is said to be the longest outdoor skating track (four and a half miles) in the United States. The resort is neither exotic or luxurious, and certainly not hip. But here, only a three-hour drive from my home in Connecticut, I could skate from one end of the lake clear to the other -- an experience about as far removed from skating at a rink as attending a spin class is from biking the Tour de France.

The place I headed every winter morning I had the opportunity, from the age of 7 or 8, was known as the mill pond, on the outskirts of town, with a simple wooden bench along one side where I laced up my skates in preparation for the great moment. Even now, so many decades later, that moment has lost none of its appeal: You step onto the ice -- a little gingerly at first, if it's been a while. The blades of your skates glide out over the surface, and your body follows, as if all the usual rules of gravity have been suspended. Never mind weak ankles or frostbitten toes, or the prospect of falling flat on your face. For me, skating on a pond is the closest I will ever know to flight.

The trade-off for skaters, between rink and pond ice, is obvious. The most beautiful natural places seldom offer the perfect, groomed conditions provided by a Zamboni. The ice is likely to be uneven, rough in patches, even buckled. Let's not forget the element of danger: Skating on thin ice is never a good idea, even metaphorically, but taken back to its literal meaning, should be avoided at all costs. Nearly every winter, growing up in New England, we'd hear the story of some foolhardy child -- or, now and then, an overzealous ice fisherman -- who ventured out onto a patch of ice that looked frozen solid but wasn't. For this reason most kids I knew who skated on the mill pond were not allowed on the ice until after New Year's, though even then, a freak thaw could render the place unsafe for skating.

In the marriage of my youth, my children's father and I even dug a pond next to our farmhouse, where we tried (seldom successfully) to clear the snow off ourselves. I will always hold onto a memory of a night when a lake, just down the road, was suddenly revealed to be perfectly frozen, from one end clear to the other distant shore: Black ice, as far as the eye could see. I can't remember what we did about our three young children, home in their beds, but we must have rounded up a sitter. Arm in arm, with no light but that of the moon, we took off across that lake. We were far from the shore when I heard the sound of cracking, and for a moment my heart stopped. But we were in no danger, really. What we heard was the sound ice makes -- even very thick, very solid ice -- when it expands and contracts, as it always does, especially in the coldest conditions. In my early 40s, I moved with my children to the San Francisco Bay Area -- a place untouched by below-freezing temperatures. I loved so much of life in California, but I had to hang up my skates. And for the next 20 years or so, my skating experiences were restricted to occasional visits, on trips to New York City, to Wollman Rink. I tried Radio City too, and Bryant Park. But their rinks were always so crowded. The illusion of flight, impossible. Five years ago, I was back in New England with my second husband, Jim, on the hardest kind of mission. We had flown the 3,000 miles to Boston in search of a surgeon willing to operate on Jim, in the hopes of successfully removing a tumor in his pancreas.

The weekend of our Boston trip, a small, good thing happened, in the midst of great sorrow: Word came to me from a friend back in my old hometown, not far away, that a deep chill had left the ice in perfectly glassy shape for skating. With no medical appointments until midafternoon, I hotfooted it back to New Hampshire, borrowed a pair of skates, and set out on the ice of my old mill pond. And because the Lamprey River that connects to that pond was also frozen, I skated a mile down that river, too, with a Joni Mitchell song playing in my head. ""I wish I had a river I could skate away on."" That day I did. The year after Jim died, I moved back to the East Coast. And in the face of vast loss, a small joy returned: skating. I sharpened the blades of my old skates. Renewed my quest for ice. I knew about the canals in Ottawa, of course (also Toronto). But I kept hoping to find something closer to home. This is when I discovered the Lake Morey Resort.

Situated in the town of Fairlee, Vt., just over the New Hampshire border near Dartmouth College and Hanover, Lake Morey covers an area of 545 acres. Plenty of other lakes exist in the vicinity, of course. What distinguishes this one is that the town has taken it upon itself to keep the perimeter plowed. Four and a half miles' worth of open skating trail. A person doesn't actually have to stay at the Lake Morey Resort to skate on the lake, by the way, and plenty of locals evidently do so on a regular basis. The thing about booking a weekend at the resort -- as I did, for my daughter, Audrey, and her boyfriend, Tod, and me -- is that you get to walk straight from your room out onto the ice. After a long skate, you can go into the lodge and warm up. The weekend we stayed at Lake Morey, the annual winter carnival was going on at the resort, which meant that the place was packed with young hockey players -- age 3 or 4 and up -- along with a significant contingent of hockey parents. To accommodate them all, the resort keeps a dozen or so separate spaces plowed for the games that go on throughout the day. Maybe some people -- in search of a quiet getaway -- might view the presence of so many kids bearing hockey sticks as diminishing the romance. As for me, I liked taking in the spectacle of so many very small hockey players running around in puffy coats with helmets and big sticks. They weren't going where I was, anyway: the skating trail around the edge of the lake.

When you're skating a four-and-a-half mile long trail, you don't need to worry about crowds. Nobody's coming along behind you, or hotdogging alongside. No background music, and none is needed. You might hear the wind whistling through the trees. Nothing more. I skated the loop three times that weekend. Audrey and Tod went twice as far on their fast skates. By the time we finished, the sun was going down, and the hockey players had called it a day. Only a handful of skaters remained on the ice by then, though a father and daughter remained on one of the patches of ice cleared for hockey, practicing their puck handling as the last light of day disappeared with a final flash of pink behind the mountains. Later that evening, on the drive back to the resort after dinner in town, I noted that the moon had risen -- a nearly full moon that seemed to hang directly over the frozen lake. Audrey and Tod opted for a little Ping-Pong before bed, but I knew where I was headed: back onto the ice -- empty of all skaters now; I had the whole lake to myself. I set out one more time, humming my theme song under the stars. All my life I had wished I had a river I could skate away on. That night, I discovered, a lake would do.

LAURA HOPTMAN Absolutely, and not secret at all. Verne was like a key. I did have a couple of my own artist friends. Everyone always says I discovered Gabriel Orozco. I truly did discover him in an elevator of a gallery building when he couldn't speak any English. I thought he was super handsome and gave him my phone number. It was an accident that he turned out to be a great artist.

VERNE DAWSON That work with the family of monkeys, over the mantel, is by Bill Lynch. He was a close friend of mine who passed away in 2015 at 53 and became schizophrenic as he aged. During his life, he had never had a real show. I organized an exhibition, the only show I ever curated, at White Columns after he died. His mother asked me to pick a painting out from the show to have. He painted this on the backing of a cheap mirror with broken glass. I like the blackness of it, sort of the opposite of the light of a mirror. I feel it does almost all those things a mirror does, only differently.

Global Business,European Officials Struggle Toward a Debt Solution,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/business/global/europeans-struggle-toward-debt-solution.html,"PARIS -- European finance ministers said on Saturday that they had moved closer to a comprehensive solution for the debt crisis during a two-day gathering of officials from the Group of 20 industrial nations, despite a number of unresolved problems that could still widen the scope of the crisis.

With Europe's economic and financial woes weighing on prospects for global growth, officials said they had agreed to take ""all necessary measures needed to stabilize the financial system"" and to contain the troubles. The officials did not provide specifics, but said they were working toward introducing a grand plan at a meeting on Oct. 23 in Brussels.

The United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, who along with President Obama has urged the Europeans to move more forcefully to keep the crisis from infecting the global economy, said he was ""encouraged by the direction and speed"" at which the Europeans were moving, and by French and German pledges to find a solution.

""But as you know,"" Mr. Geithner said, the ultimate impact of Europe's efforts is ""all in the details, and it's very hard to judge the impact that something will have until you see it take shape.""","At a Group of 20 meeting, finance ministers said they were working toward introducing a comprehensive solution to the debt crisis later this month in Brussels.",b01844be-1f69-59f5-82ed-79e8f10fa86d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/10/16/business/16euro-pic/16euro-pic-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2011&h=397&w=600&s=6825c1bef7cedb8011117ff97a7ffeaea835c2665dc7bfa02f717a2463f2ab53&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Francois Baroin, France's finance minister, left, the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F.

Books,'The Power of Adrienne Rich' Captures a Forceful and Complicated Poet,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/books/review-power-of-adrienne-rich-biography-hilary-holladay.html,"[The Best Books of 2020: View our full list.] Long before I read her, I disliked Adrienne Rich. It was received opinion. When I was in high school, the people I respected (English teachers, good ones, and fellow bookstore employees, male and female), rolled their eyes at the mention of her name. She was a radical lesbian separatist who didn't want men at her readings and would not respond to their questions. She was, it was thought, a humorless scold. Worse, Rich was perceived to have bent her sensitive talent on a political wheel. When Susan Sontag cracked her on the snout in an exchange of views in The New York Review of Books in 1975, referring to her ""anti-intellectualism,"" it was catnip for what would become my crowd. It took me two decades to push past this and to read Rich on my own. I located the diamantine intensities in so many of her poems, which are as vital and influential in their way as Sylvia Plath's or Elizabeth Bishop's. I began to appreciate, rather late, why her work of the 1970s and 1980s was essential to second-wave feminists and so many others. Eight years after Rich's death, at 82, comes Hilary Holladay's ""The Power of Adrienne Rich,"" which allows us to meet this prickly poet fresh and entire. It's the first proper biography of her, and there's a lot to unpack. This is a good story well-told.

[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of November. See the full list. ] Rich was a child prodigy. She played Mozart on the piano and dictated stories by the age of 4. Her father, a pathologist at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore, sensed his daughter's genius. He tightly controlled her education and ruthlessly urged her to work harder and better. Mostly she enjoyed this urging; she was an apt pupil. By the time Rich was in high school, others saw her intelligence and high seriousness and were a bit terrified of her. While she was still at Radcliffe College -- she was, with Ursula K. Le Guin and Rona Jaffe, in the class of 1951 -- Rich's first collection of poems, ""A Change of World,"" was selected by W. H. Auden and published in the Yale Younger Poets series. Rich would become known for the intensity of her public readings, and already she drew crowds.

One man who wasn't impressed was John Simon, who would become famous as a sclerotic and blazingly chauvinistic, even by the dictates of his time, literary and film critic. About a reading Rich gave at Harvard in 1952, he commented: ""To appreciate it fully, one would need the combined attributes of a Homer and a Beethoven, namely blindness and deafness."" It's almost a running gag in this biography, watching Simon pop up at various points to take aim at Rich with his pea shooter. Rich was not born a rebel. She wore heels and stockings to her classes at Radcliffe, while other women wore more sensible shoes, and wanted to marry young and have children. She got engaged to a serious young Harvard man who wore a coat and tie every day. When she broke off the engagement, he was shattered and began developing the mental illness that plagued him for life. The loss of Rich's affection could apparently be devastating. When years later she announced she was leaving her husband, the economist Alfred H. Conrad, and their three young sons, Conrad drove to Vermont and committed suicide near the family's summer house.

She'd met Conrad before she left for Oxford, where she went to study and write. There she fell in with a crowd that included the poets Donald Hall and Geoffrey Hill. She began publishing poems in The New Yorker, rare for someone in their 20s, while there. The magazine gave her a first-reading agreement and paid her an annual stipend. The couple married in 1953 and moved to New York City, where Conrad taught economics at City University and Rich wrote and taught at several schools. As the 1950s became the 1960s, both became increasingly political. Rich had been plagued by rheumatoid arthritis since her 20s, and she could not march in the streets. Conrad did enough of that for both of them. Rich's political awakening became a feminist one. She began to see her father as a tyrannical patriarch, for good and ill. She saw how Harvard shunted women off to the side at Radcliffe. She sensed she was a token female in the largely male poetry world. The oink of male chauvinism, she found, was impossible to evade. Her husband traveled a good deal and their marriage frayed. Holladay's biography builds, in many ways, toward a scene in 1970 in which Rich declares, to her husband and friends, including the poet Hayden Carruth, that she ""planned to give away her pots and pans and do a lot less cooking."" It was the first step into a new life. Hilary Holladay, author of ""The Power of Adrienne Rich,"" a new biography. Rich's first real relationship with a woman was with her older, imposing analyst, Lilly Engler. (Engler had slept with Sontag, as would Rich.) Rich's time with Engler informed the poems that would announce her coming out as a lesbian, collected in ""The Dream of a Common Language"" (1978). The eroticism in these poems was radical for the time; Rich wrote of strong tongues and ""my rose-wet cave."" Rich's sexuality was forceful and complicated. She and Conrad, for a time, had an open marriage. Rich slept with Robert Lowell, among others. Later she would have an affair with the poet June Jordan. (Rich paid for Jordan to see a therapist after she left her.) Her friend Audre Lorde attempted to seduce her -- Rich preferred to remain friends. Rich met the woman with whom she would spend the final decades of her life, the Jamaican-born writer Michelle Cliff, in 1976. At the time Cliff was a copy editor at Norton, Rich's publisher, working on one of Rich's books.

There is so much in this book that can only be hinted at in a review of this length. How Louise Gluck, the new Nobel laureate, was no admirer of Rich's teaching practices at Columbia University when Gluck was a student there. (Rich's remarks on her students' poems were often limited to a comment like, ""I don't dig it."") How Anthony Burgess sublet Rich's New York apartment, tore it up, then wrote a novel that satirized its feminist contents. The rave review from Margaret Atwood of Rich's masterly collection ""Diving into the Wreck,"" on the front page of The New York Times Book Review in 1973, which pushed Rich's career into orbit. Helen Vendler and Francine du Plessix Gray were among the writers who took issue with aspects of Rich's essays and poetry. If Holladay's solid biography has a weak spot, it's that she makes it difficult for anyone to criticize Rich's work, for any reason whatsoever, and not be thought complicit in the grinding machinery of misogyny. Holladay, whose previous books include a biography of the Beat writer Herbert Huncke, is a sensitive reader of Rich's poetry. She also explicates Rich's windswept moods. She could be imperious and ungrateful. She dropped friends easily and often. She was, as the critic Elaine Showalter comments, ""not the sort of person you'd cozy up to."" Late in her life, Rich became interested in her Jewishness, conversations about which her father had suppressed. Her family name had long before been changed from Reich to Rich.

 The Birmingham Church Bombing That Changed the Course of Civil Rights

 By Doug Jones As he fell behind an accused sexual predator in returns from Alabama's 2017 Senate election, Doug Jones admits, he allowed himself an almost ""unbearable"" lament familiar to thousands of frustrated Alabamians who came of age in the George Wallace era: ""Oh, my poor home state."" Near midnight, it appeared that Jones's pistol-waving opponent, the former Alabama Supreme Court justice Roy Moore, would join the century-long parade of reactionary buffoons Alabama's white majority has sent to Congress and the governor's mansion. But in the final count for that Dec. 12 election, a cresting wave of modern sentiment among black voters and white women in the state's rich Republican suburbs handed Jones a 22,000-vote victory, making Alabama the last state of the old Confederacy to join the New South. It was the biggest upset in Alabama political history, especially given Jones's background as a successful prosecutor of Ku Klux Klansmen who perpetrated the signature civil rights crime of the 1960s, the fatal bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham.

""Bending Toward Justice: The Birmingham Church Bombing That Changed the Course of Civil Rights"" is a valuable addition to the historical record of Alabama's role as the battleground state of the civil rights revolution. It provides an inside look at how Jones, a former United States attorney from Birmingham, and his role model, the former Alabama attorney general Bill Baxley, sent to prison three Birmingham Klansmen who murdered four black girls by dynamiting their church on Sept. 15, 1963. The four children, aged 11 to 14 -- Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robertson and Cynthia Morris Wesley -- died instantly in a women's restroom where they were preparing for Sunday school. Without Jones and Baxley, both white men born in Alabama and educated in the state's law schools, the murders of the children killed on that ""bloody Sunday"" and memorialized in Spike Lee's wrenching film ""4 Little Girls"" would have gone forever unpunished. (I was interviewed in Lee's film, and my reports that first identified the four bombers by name were nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in investigative reporting by this newspaper in 1983.) With this book, Jones invites us -- indeed, challenges us -- to look anew at the central paradox of the case. The three bombers were all convicted on evidence from confidential interviews and wiretaps conducted by F.B.I. agents who were on the scene in Birmingham in the mid-60s. Yet the agency's Washington leadership sought at every opportunity to impede Jones, Baxley and their chief investigator, the former Alabama state detective Bob Eddy.

During the past year, I was lucky enough to talk to all three men in Alabama, and Jones's account provides an opportunity to revisit both the remarkable dark-horse campaign that made him the first Democratic senator from the South's reddest state in nearly three decades, as well as this tormenting saga of justice long delayed by Justice Department ineptitude and the personal malfeasance of the longtime F.B.I. director J. Edgar Hoover. Jones's account is evenhanded to a fault: He fails to emphasize the villainous role of Hoover as the chief reason that Robert ""Dynamite Bob"" Chambliss and his two thuggish accomplices, Tommy Blanton and Bobby Frank Cherry, were all old men before Baxley and Jones were able to put them behind bars in a series of three dramatic trials conducted in 1977, 2001 and 2002. A Justice Department task force reviewing F.B.I. misconduct in investigating crimes in Alabama proved that Hoover stalled the investigation in 1965, causing a delay that continued well beyond his death in 1972.

I first got on the trail of ""Dynamite Bob"" in 1974 when conducting interviews for an oral history of the civil rights movement, ""My Soul Is Rested."" An Alabama detective, Ben Allen, showed me a memo listing Chambliss, Blanton, Cherry, Herman Frank Cash and Troy Ingram as members of the Cahaba River group, a Klan bombing squad that planned the attack on the 16th Street Church. (Cash and Ingram died before they could be indicted when Baxley reopened the case in 1974.) I was back in Birmingham in 1977 to report on Baxley's prosecution of Chambliss before an integrated jury, and learned from ""Bending Toward Justice"" that Jones was in the balcony of the same courtroom. He had cut law school classes to watch his hero argue the case. Although we did not meet until 2000, Jones and I have in common that we were drawn to the 16th Street case with a near-obsessional intensity because we grew up in the steel-mill neighborhoods frequented by the bombers. Jones went on to become a breakthrough figure in Alabama politics. His victory in the Senate race stunned the state's complacent machine Republicans. Jones explains how he bushwhacked Moore, a randy Bible-thumper endorsed by President Trump, with a combination of high-tech and grass-roots tactics that Democrats could deploy again in other sleepy red states in 2020. Jones assembled a Heart of Dixie version of the Obama coalition, and was well positioned when The Washington Post revealed that Roy Moore had been a serial stalker of high school girls when he was in his 30s. Both Trump and Steve Bannon came south to campaign for Moore, giving the Republican effort a kooky carnival atmosphere, but by that time disaffected Republican women had come to regard Moore as unfit. Jones takes rightful pride in recounting how he and his Washington campaign consultant, Joe Trippi, used a multimillion-dollar television campaign to defeat a deep-pocketed but listless Republican Party funded by Birmingham lawyers and the corporate manipulators who rule Montgomery. This book ought to be studied by national Democrats looking to rescue populist idealism from its Trumpian captivity. Bill Baxley and Doug Jones have earned high places in Southern history by helping Alabama -- at least for a few precious moments -- overcome the reputational damage done by Wallace, Bull Connor and Chambliss's claque of K.K.K. bombers. For years, Chambliss had walk-in, coffee-drinking privileges at Connor's police command center. Chambliss also told 16th Street investigators that he had turned on Wallace only when the governor, who knew him on sight, tried to avoid shaking hands with him and his wife at a segregationist rally in a Birmingham hotel.

It is one of the supreme ironies of the case that Chambliss, Cherry and Blanton all talked themselves into prison. Chambliss and Cherry boasted to relatives about ""blowing up"" the church, and an F.B.I. bug planted in Blanton's kitchen caught him telling his wife about ""making the bomb."" The Blanton tapes were among the thousands of pieces of evidence eventually provided to Jones for the Blanton trial in 2001 and the Cherry trial in 2002, but withheld from Baxley when he indicted Chambliss in 1977. In a joint appearance with Jones at a civil rights panel in Montgomery on Jan. 23 of this year, Baxley said flatly that he could have convicted Blanton along with ""Dynamite Bob"" in 1977. Baxley furiously denounced Hoover for sabotaging his investigation, but in his book, Jones does not fully come to grips with Hoover's treachery: He concludes that Hoover ""decided with some justification"" that trying the case in Birmingham would be ""a fruitless endeavor."" On Feb. 17, 1980, I wrote about a series of memos to Hoover in 1965 in which the energetic F.B.I. agents in Birmingham asked permission to take the case to trial ""due to the climate of public opinion favoring prosecution."" My italics about the likelihood of prosecution underscore the remarkable backlash among Birmingham whites because of the heinous nature of the crime.

As Jones notes, a force of 40 agents with ""boots on the ground"" in Alabama had found two female relatives of Chambliss, his sister-in-law, Mary Frances Cunningham, and niece, the Rev. Elizabeth Cobbs, willing to testify against him. On May 13, 1965, the special agent in charge in Birmingham said ""the case was ripe for departmental action."" But in less than a week, Hoover pulled the plug on the case. ""From an evaluation of the evidence received so far in this investigation, the chance of successful prosecution in state or federal court is very remote,"" Hoover wrote. ""In view of this, the bureau disapproves at this time of the conference you recommend with the U.S. attorney and the solicitor for the 10th Judicial Circuit in Birmingham."" This was Hoover hubris at its most extreme. Without ever setting foot in Birmingham, Hoover fenced off Macon Weaver, a seasoned federal prosecutor, from receiving the evidence that dozens of F.B.I. agents on the scene believed sufficient to put Chambliss, Blanton and possibly Cherry away in one fell swoop. Jones touches inconclusively on a mystery that has confounded every journalist, historian and prosecutor who has delved into the ""whodunit"" details. In 1965, Chambliss's niece and sister-in-law told F.B.I. agents that they had watched in hiding as the four Klansmen planted the bomb. They said they had disguised themselves in wigs and followed Blanton's 1957 Chevrolet to the church. Over time, their ticktock of the case has held up, matching all the known facts to near perfection. But Cobbs later said she was passing along hearsay provided by Chambliss's much-abused wife, Tee. Cunningham later recanted the wig story entirely and failed a lie-detector test about her original statement to investigators.

An additional complication arose when it emerged that Cunningham and James Hancock, a deputy for the Jefferson County sheriff's department, may have been involved romantically and therefore delayed warning the police and church members in a timely way. ""Just one phone call from Hancock,"" Bob Eddy told Jones. ""It would never have happened."" This mass of conflicting details will probably never be untangled, but the confusion does not undermine the core of the case as set forth in uncontested supporting evidence. When I talked to Eddy and Baxley last year, both expressed the view that the later recantations by Cobbs and Cunningham were dubious. They believe that Cunningham, Cobbs and perhaps Chambliss's wife were at the church that night and witnessed some or all of the events involving the placing of the bomb. The scenario described to F.B.I. agents by Cobbs and Cunningham in 1965 is now generally accepted. As Jones correctly notes, the evidentiary trail in this case is full of conflicts and contradictions, and at this late date, it is unlikely that even a painstaking book devoted solely to the investigation could answer all the questions. But one home truth shines clear and earns ""Bending Toward Justice"" a permanent place in the civil rights canon. Simply stated, using piecemeal evidence that a dishonest F.B.I. director wanted to keep out of court, Bill Baxley and Doug Jones put together a convincing case that proved beyond reasonable doubt that Alabama juries convicted the right men for murder. Chambliss and Cherry died in prison, and Tommy Blanton, whose Chevy delivered the bomb to the church in the midnight hours more than 50 years ago, cannot, at the age of 80, be far behind.","Doug Jones's ""Bending Toward Justice"" is about his role in the famous 1963 church-bombing case and his experience running for senator in 2017.",e4f73096-765b-57e6-998f-8c6821034db5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/31/books/review/31Raines1/31Raines1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=a1d1b5ac55aeb5ab89675f336b9f8e4f0b7010f03e8f677b63a70aaa6a5067a9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Rev.

Dance,"Planting Their Feet in a Soviet Past, From Tone to Style to Repertory",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/29/arts/dance/bolshoi-ballet-turns-back-the-clock-in-its-new-york-season.html,"Back in the final years of the Soviet Union, New York and London patrons learned that the price of watching Russian ballet companies was to undergo a heightened security process on entering theaters. Currently, however, there's a preposterous incongruity at the David H. Koch Theater. Bag-checking is standard for its home company, New York City Ballet, but not for guest companies. So no bags were examined for the Bolshoi Ballet's two-week 2014 season at the theater, which ended on Sunday. And yet, despite the relative ease of entry, it was hard not to think of politics when watching the Bolshoi's repertory -- which was entirely pre-glasnost. Seeing the tedious mix of ""Swan Lake"" (in Yuri Grigorovich's dismal production), ""Don Quixote"" (in Alexei Fadeyechev's version) and ""Spartacus"" (all Grigorovich and all hokum) was to feel the clock turned back 40 years. What on earth does the company's artistic director, Sergei Filin, make of this artistic recession? It was moving to observe him in the aisles of the theater during the Bolshoi's Lincoln Center Festival performances. Though the damage inflicted on his sight and skin in an acid attack early last year ought to make him a tragic figure, he looks purposeful, focused, businesslike. His elegant carriage, eloquent head movements behind dark glasses and intent animation in conversation with colleagues were far more fascinating than any drama we saw onstage. He can have no cause for pride in a repertory that reflects none of the policies he has introduced since becoming director. New York was given a non-Filin season; whoever was responsible for choosing the repertory (the Bolshoi or the Lincoln Center Festival), then shame on it for giving us fare that amounted to the company's lowest common denominator.

From 2011 to 2014, the Bolshoi led the world in the diversity of its live ballet broadcasts. Like the company's last seasons in London and Paris, they reflected Mr. Filin's choices -- whether new stagings of 19th-century ballets (""Coppelia"" and ""Marco Spada""), Western 20th-century ballets (Balanchine's ""Jewels"") or 21st-century creations by Alexei Ratmansky (""The Bright Stream"" and ""Lost Illusions""). I note with disquiet how much less adventurous the announced fare is for the 2014-15 broadcasts. The Grigorovich repertory predominates, with stagings of ""The Legend of Love,"" ""Ivan the Terrible,"" ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Swan Lake,"" and nothing new. Check the Bolshoi website, and you find that the company's lineup includes several other Grigorovich productions. The company has dropped Frederick Ashton's classic version of ""La Fille Mal Gardee,"" which it acquired in 2002, in favor of one by -- guess who -- Mr. Grigorovich. Its main new production for 2013-14 has been a ""Taming of the Shrew"" by Jean-Christophe Maillot, a choreographer who is chiefly known in the West for trivializing ""Romeo and Juliet"" and ""Swan Lake."" It would be good to sum up the Bolshoi season in New York by concentrating on the dancers. During the company's two weeks here, I grew increasingly impressed by Maria Vinogradova, a soloist who had two roles in ""Swan Lake,"" one in ""Don Quixote"" and who on Saturday played Phrygia in ""Spartacus."" An elegant dancer with a strikingly beautiful face, she often danced in an old-Bolshoi style. In grand jete, she hurls her front leg ahead like a javelin, powerfully pulling her whole body up into the air, and she delivers Phrygia's solos and duets heroically. Her Spartacus was Denis Rodkin, one of the company's first soloists (one category up the hierarchy): He's big, powerful, beautiful, though his face doesn't register theatrically as yet. He had already made a powerful, glamorous impression as the toreador Espada in ""Don Quixote."" But it's sad to watch these talented dancers in ""Spartacus."" I'm not immune to its many cheap thrills, but it reduces everyone to a Flash Gordon level of humanity -- and, as people have been remarking since at least the 1980s, the Roman scenes led by Crassus and Aegina have all the absurdity of ""Springtime for Hitler.""

The ballet's worst choreography lies in its aimless, repetitious, effect-laden solos for Phrygia and Aegina (each keeps extending a leg in the air and then clutching it, as if this meant something), and, as poor as Khachaturian's music is, it's startling to see how Mr. Grigorovich squanders it here. During Phrygia's first third-act solo, when the famous big melody arrives, she just carries on with no change of tone, and soon merely spreads herself on the floor. What room for real artistry is there here? I enjoyed Mikhail Lobukhin as Basilio in ""Don Quixote"" and as Spartacus -- he combines testosterone and charm in equal measure -- but everything he does is along the lines that the unsurpassed Vladimir Vassiliev established decades ago. (There's even a slight resemblance.) In a grand pas de deux, it's gruesome to see how Russian companies still stop the music after the ballerina's 32 fouette turns so that she can acknowledge the applause. Don't they realize how much more momentum a coda acquires if the music and dance sweep on? The way the male dancer in ""Swan Lake"" and ""Don Quixote"" has to start again in silence is ludicrous. When I first saw Olga Smirnova dance the Queen of the Dryads in ""Don Quixote,"" her solo seemed to give us too little of her; only two days before, I'd seen her as Odette-Odile in ""Swan Lake."" But a second viewing of the same solo showed too many of the bad sides of the Bolshoi style -- above all, the labored, after-the-beat emphasis. This isn't her fault. January's broadcast of Balanchine's ""Diamonds"" showed her originality; there she was sui generis, and not a throwback to any bygone Russian or American ballerina. What does she have to look forward to in coming Bolshoi seasons as the Grigorovich ballets tighten their grim grip on the repertory? What lies ahead for this whole company, so richly talented, yet now tumbling back into a pre-1989 nightmare?","Watching the Bolshoi Ballet season that just concluded at Lincoln Center was like seeing the clock turned back, with all of the repertory predating glasnost.",f51d674b-2c11-5ad3-b7a1-a5c80f45522e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/29/arts/BOLSHOI/BOLSHOI-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=390&w=600&s=593bd67d07af60676cf429ce2e24cbe6cab86c33a41e89893a94c84b04f68218&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Denis Rodkin in a Bolshoi Ballet performance of ""Don Quixote"" at Lincoln Center last week.",f51d674b-2c11-5ad3-b7a1-a5c80f45522e,N24News/imgs/f51d674b-2c11-5ad3-b7a1-a5c80f45522e.jpg,6
Technology,WhatsApp's New Feature Continues Facebook's Snapchat Mimicry,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/technology/whatsapp-status-facebook-snapchat.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Facebook offered $3 billion to buy the ephemeral messaging app Snapchat in 2013. Snapchat's founder, Evan Spiegel, turned down the offer. Ever since, Facebook and some of its top apps -- including Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger -- have been trying to tap into the explosively popular photo-sharing features pioneered by Snapchat. The latest sign of that came on Monday as WhatsApp, a mobile messaging application used by 1.2 billion people, unveiled a version of its Status feature that takes a significant number of cues from Snapchat. Similar to Snapchat's Stories feature, WhatsApp's Status now lets people share images, GIFs and videos as a status update, all of which last for 24 hours before disappearing. The move follows a string of actions by Facebook to emulate Snapchat. In August, Instagram introduced a Stories feature that was a near exact copy of Snapchat's. In December, Messenger revamped its look and feel to emphasize sending photos, just like Snapchat. As Snapchat's parent company, Snap, has positioned itself as a camera company, Facebook has experimented with making a camera feature the first thing people see when opening up the social network's main app.

Even if imitation is the highest compliment, WhatsApp executives are not admitting it. ""We build things because we really hope people will want to use them even more,"" Randall Sarafa, a product manager at WhatsApp, said in an interview about the new version of Status. Avoiding any direct mention of Snapchat, he added, ""We don't really think about building things for other reasons."" A Snapchat spokeswoman declined to comment on the similarities with WhatsApp, and a press officer for Instagram declined to comment beyond past public statements. But the Facebook Messenger spokeswoman Jennifer Hakes said: ""In some ways, the camera is now replacing the keyboard. As more people use Messenger in their everyday lives, we wanted to make it faster, simpler and more fun to send photos and videos -- so we built the new Messenger camera."" Facebook's moves are unfolding at a critical moment for Snap. The company is set to go public next month in what is likely to be one of the biggest technology public offerings since those of the social media service Twitter in 2013 and the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014. Investors have been grousing about how unprofitable Snap is and how its number of users appears small. On Sunday, Sriram Krishnan, a top Snapchat product manager, said on Twitter that he was leaving the company. Facebook's emulation of Snapchat has a broader significance in that the network and its apps are moving toward a more visual and interactive form of communication. For years, applications like WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter were primarily text-based. Twitter rose to popularity by capitalizing on SMS short-form texts, and the majority of the more than than 50 billion WhatsApp messages sent on a daily basis are text-based.

But in 2011, Mr. Spiegel saw a new possibility when he and Bobby Murphy, his Stanford University fraternity brother, founded Snapchat. Their focus was on making it simple to send photos and videos to friends. Making the camera the focus -- unlike competitors, Snapchat makes it the first thing you see after opening the app -- allows people to send images much faster than with other apps, which often require two or three steps to open the camera. Snapchat's emphasis has also been on ephemerality, with photos and stories disappearing shortly after they are sent. That focus has made it far easier for people to send more photos to one another because they do not have to worry about those images sticking around forever. Snapchat's users send more than 2.5 billion messages and images each day, according to the company's initial public offering prospectus. WhatsApp's Status now lets people share images, GIFs and videos as a status update, all of which last for 24 hours before disappearing. Competitors like Instagram, the photo-sharing site owned by Facebook, eventually realized how popular different models of sharing photos and multimedia status updates had become. After reports of a decline in photo-sharing inside its app, Instagram began making changes to keep users coming back and sharing more photos. Last March, Instagram switched to an algorithm-driven, personalized feed of photos, a shift from the reverse-chronological order it had historically used. In August, Instagram introduced its Snapchat look-alike, Stories. How much coordination there is within Facebook and among WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger over how to grapple with Snapchat is unclear. While executives at the company regularly meet with Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, to check in and give updates on long-term product strategy, they have said in past interviews that they maintain a level of workplace autonomy. ""We operate in a largely independent way from Facebook,"" Mr. Sarafa, of WhatsApp, said in a recent interview.

Still, many of the product executives at these companies acknowledge that some of their updates are not entirely original and give credit to Snapchat for creating a new kind of ""format."" In an interview in August, Kevin Systrom, a founder and the chief executive of Instagram, did not mention Snapchat by name but acknowledged that ""other companies deserve all the credit"" for popularizing disappearing photos and videos. ""This format unlocks a new version of creativity for us,"" Mr. Systrom said. ""I think Instagram will be judged by where we go from here and what we make of it in the future."" Instagram's Stories product -- the Snapchat look-alike -- has since become a hit: More than 150 million people use it daily. In its initial public offering filing, Snap cited the direction of Instagram as a potential risk factor to its own growth. At WhatsApp, the Status feature was originally conceived as a text-based away message, similar to the one in AOL's Instant Messenger product of the 1990s, which made it easy to let friends know if you were around to text or if you were too busy. The updated Status feature replaces that text with richer multimedia. Now, as with Snapchat's Stories, WhatsApp users can post photos, videos and GIFs as their status, which lasts for 24 hours before disappearing. WhatsApp users can also send their status updates as messages to individual or multiple friends at once, much the way Snapchat's messaging system is structured. WhatsApp recognizes that its latest feature may not be completely original. But it still hopes it will bring the app similar success. ""Obviously we're all seeing broad adoption of this format across the industry right now,"" Mr. Sarafa said. ""Our hope is that with this update, people will find new ways to share and consume media on WhatsApp, too.""","With Facebook and some of its top apps trying to tap into popular features pioneered by Snapchat, WhatsApp unveiled a version of its Status feature that focuses on sharing images.",fcefd2ee-55ae-52e5-984b-5254a4bab63c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/21/business/21FACEBOOK1/21FACEBOOK1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=f754fddaeb065704ac24e14f07968d84e21389a810b78a1eb685153dd09be44c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"WhatsApp, a mobile messaging application owned by Facebook, updated its Status feature, a move that follows a string of actions by Facebook to emulate Snapchat.",fcefd2ee-55ae-52e5-984b-5254a4bab63c,N24News/imgs/fcefd2ee-55ae-52e5-984b-5254a4bab63c.jpg,20

A video went viral showing Mitt Romney, who turned 72 on Tuesday, blowing out the candles on his birthday cake, which was made entirely of Twinkies. Instead of blowing out all the candles in a single breath, he lifted up each individual Twinkie and blew them out one by one. (You won't know how odd it looks until you see it.)

In the video, his staff members seem to awkwardly titter as Romney blows out the first few candles, then an encompassing silence sets in. Trevor Noah had an easy time making fun of it. ""When the laughter died down in that clip, that's when everyone realized they were standing next to a serial killer. Because, I'm sorry, blowing out candles one by one, I think we can all agree, is extremely weird."" -- TREVOR NOAH ""I do get why Mitt Romney likes Twinkies. They're exactly like him: white on the outside, but somehow even whiter on the inside."" -- TREVOR NOAH ""A park in Pennsylvania is closing one of its roads on rainy nights for the next month so that amphibians like frogs and salamanders can mate without threat from passing cars.

Movies,Reading 'Us' Through Its T-shirts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/movies/us-jordan-peele-shirts.html,"You could watch Jordan Peele's ""Us"" a dozen times and still not catch all of the symbolism, references and ideas tucked in it. Yes, scissors are clearly a thing, but what's with that tuxedo T-shirt? The movie, ostensibly about a family, the Wilsons, hunted by its doppelgangers, is something of an awards contender. Its star, Lupita Nyong'o, is up for a Screen Actors Guild Award on Jan. 19 for her haunting portrayal of a mother with a painful past and a demented double speaking in a creepy voice. But performance is only one piece in this cinematic puzzle (now streaming on HBO). If you look closely, you'll see that some of the narrative threads are woven right into the costumes -- the tops in particular. In an interview, Peele, who wrote and directed ""Us,"" said the choice of T-shirts ""represents one of the central themes, which is the identity, the outward-facing branding that we present to the world."" But he also said the shirts were an opportunity to incorporate ""little Easter eggs and coincidences, which are a major theme for the movie as well.""

The Wilsons' son, Jason (played by Evan Alex), is seen in a long-sleeve shirt with a tuxedo print on the front. It's a fun look for a character who is a bit of a performer and enjoys magic tricks, but there's more to the boy. ""I always thought of him as the mage of the group,"" Peele said. ""He's young, but he has a wisdom. He sees and understands things that other people in his family don't."" Visually, Peele wanted a shirt for him that would contrast with the ""Jaws"" top Jason also wears. It's like an arrow facing downward, as opposed to ""Jaws,"" an arrow facing upward. ""This reflects the central battle between the monster rising up and those going down,"" he said.

""It could always be an argument for the best movie ever made,"" he said. ""One of the reasons it resonates is because it's able to scare us, with this great feeling. It doesn't bum you out, but it's terrifying. To find that combination is special."" He wanted to conjure that emotion for a beach sequence while paying tribute to the earlier film in several ways throughout ""Us."" Peele said that the shirt is a perfect representation of the theme of darkness rising from below, a shadow that can't be seen at first but is imminent. He had to get Spielberg's permission to use the image. ""He gave me his blessing and specified the design that he wanted for it,"" Peele said.

""The revolution against the country that the Black Flag iconography suggests was appropriate,"" Peele said. ""But also the logo is four lines in a row that make this flag. That contributed to the recurring theme of 11:11 in my film"" -- a reference to the Bible verse Jeremiah 11:11, about a reckoning from God -- ""as well as the image of four shadowy figures."" ""It's this idea that all these pieces of the puzzle are on this strange line between coincidence and fate.""

Rabbits keep popping (hopping?) up in the movie. The opening credits play over a shot of cages full of rabbits against the wall of what looks like a classroom. And rabbit motifs adorn the apparel of the Wilsons' daughter, Zora, played by Shahadi Wright Joseph. Why? Partly because she's a competitive runner, but that's not the only reason. ""There's something about this movie I always thought of as an Easter story, sort of an Easter horror story,"" Peele said. ""It's a return from the cave of a messiah, of sorts."" Zora also wears a green short-sleeve hoodie that just says ""tho"" on it. ""There's something about the word 'tho' as it translates into our culture that has a sort of teenage text connotation,"" Peele said. But he also said ""tho"" can be used to mean rabbit in Vietnamese. ""I just figured that anyone who speaks Vietnamese is getting an extra little Easter egg.""","With its star, Lupita Nyong'o, in awards contention this season, a look at the clothes that helped tell the story.",c4209597-4ae2-5d3c-a22c-e140492f7783,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/03/arts/us-shirts2/us-shirts2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=9889d6755964f6cfc6899c5476a3374498c4eabe5da0dc5a4a50a97e3a3d8e0c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The &ldquo;Jaws&rdquo; image had to be approved by that movie&rsquo;s director, Steven Spielberg.",c4209597-4ae2-5d3c-a22c-e140492f7783,N24News/imgs/c4209597-4ae2-5d3c-a22c-e140492f7783.jpg,5
Media,"For News Media, a Day of Solidarity in a Summer of Unease",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/16/business/media/news-media-editorials-trump.html,"For the nation's journalists, this has been a summer of unease and unrest. On live television, a caller to C-Span threatened ""to shoot"" a pair of CNN journalists, Don Lemon and Brian Stelter, for their political commentary. In Tampa, Fla., rallygoers hurled vitriol at reporters covering a speech by President Trump, who later tweeted his approval. Mr. Trump added a new adjective to his nickname for the media -- ""the fake, fake, disgusting news"" -- and his press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, declined to disavow the phrase ""enemy of the people."" All of this came on top of the usual, apolitical afflictions facing news organizations, like Tronc's move to lay off half the staff of The Daily News, decimating one of New York's biggest papers. On Thursday, newsrooms responded. In a coordinated effort started by The Boston Globe, more than 300 publications issued editorials reaffirming the purpose and promise of journalism in American society. ""Journalists Are Not The Enemy,"" declared The Globe. ""A Free Press Needs You,"" wrote The New York Times. Mixed in with pro-press quotes from founding fathers were reminders of journalists' role in provinces small and large: tying communities together, keeping citizens informed, holding governments to account. Collectively, the output read as a cri de coeur: part catharsis, part civics lesson, part plea to a public whose attitude toward the news media has soured under Mr. Trump. A poll this week by Quinnipiac University asked a black-and-white question: ""Which comes closer to your point of view: the news media is the enemy of the people, or the news media is an important part of democracy?"" Lack of nuance aside, the results were notable: 26 percent of respondents went for ""enemy of the people,"" including 51 percent of Republicans.

Whether the spate of editorials on Thursday can make a difference is not yet clear. Before publication, some prominent journalists fretted about the unintended message the effort could send to the unconvinced. ""I certainly am sympathetic with The Globe's view that the press should not be labeled the enemy of the people,"" said Fred Hiatt, the editorial page editor of The Washington Post, which declined to participate on Thursday. ""In general, however, I am reluctant to join in campaigns or movements. The diversity of the U.S. press is one of its strengths, and I believe The Post serves its readers best when speaking in its own voice and on its own timetable."" The Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Md., where five employees were killed earlier this summer in a shooting, also declined to join in. ""We're just not coordinating with other news organizations because the president's opinion, frankly, is just not that important to us,"" its editorial board wrote. ""We are far more concerned about what this community thinks of us."" Other holdouts included The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal, the latter of which ran a counterpoint that began: ""For anyone who believes that the editorial pages of American newspapers have been insufficiently critical of President Donald Trump, The Boston Globe has a solution."" The sneering extended onto Fox News, where Sean Spicer, the former Trump press secretary, cited the editorials as more evidence of bias. ""The press continues to make it about them,"" Mr. Spicer said.

Reporters at the White House, with a handful of exceptions, have responded to Mr. Trump's attacks with stoicism, even as some on the left have said they should punch back. In high-stakes moments, like Mr. Trump's July summit meeting in Helsinki with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, journalists at Reuters and The Associated Press asked simple but direct questions that yielded real insight into the president's thinking. And although news organizations have fielded death threats and hired security guards for correspondents, some reporters are reluctant to publicize these added difficulties.

The Times opinion page published an editorial in solidarity with other publications. The paper's publisher, A.G. Sulzberger, told Mr. Trump at a recent Oval Office meeting that his derogatory words have created real dangers for reporters domestic and abroad. Groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists have noted an uptick in foreign leaders, often autocrats and despots, using the phrase ""fake news"" to silence unflattering coverage and attack independent reporters.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The Times editorial made clear that reporting in an open society can lead to discomfort and distress among elected officials, in exchange for a better informed populace. It noted that Thomas Jefferson, utterer of a now-ubiquitous quote about preferring ""newspapers without a government"" over ""a government without newspapers,"" changed his tune once he experienced the scrutiny that comes with leading the nation. ""Nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper,"" Jefferson wrote in 1807. ""Truth itself becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle."" The current president, like his 19th century predecessor, also flip-flops on the press. Mr. Trump enjoyed cultivating his image in the news media, eagerly showing off to visitors a Collyer-like collection of clips about himself; at the height of the 2016 campaign, a Trump Tower boardroom was dedicated to storing hundreds of magazines and newspapers. On Thursday, responding to the day's editorials, the president once again lashed out. ""The Globe is in COLLUSION with other papers on free press,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, throwing in a ""Failing New York Times"" reference for good measure. ""The fact is that the Press is FREE to write and say anything it wants,"" he added. ""But much of what it says is FAKE NEWS, pushing a political agenda or just plain trying to hurt people. HONESTY WINS!""","Job losses, insults from Mr. Trump and threats have made this a difficult time for many journalists.

Science,How the Spittlebug Builds Its Bubbly Fortress,https://www.nytimes.com/video/science/100000006346172/how-the-spittlebug-builds-its-bubbly-fortress.html,"If you spend any time outdoors, you've seen something like this on plants. Maybe you thought, ""gross,"" and walked away. But if you're 8 years old, or a scientist interested in how insects breathe, you might have looked inside and seen a spittlebug. That's the nymph or young form of an insect called a froghopper. It's a relative of aphids and cicadas. But why the spittle? One idea was that it served as protection. Another was that it somehow helped the nymphs breathe, like bubbles of air that diving bugs use. It wasn't hard for the researchers to find the bugs to bring back to the laboratory, or to watch how they make the foam. Here's how it works. A spittle bug sucks up watery sap from plants. As it excretes urine, it forms the bubbles. The sap is not that nutritious, so the bug drinks a lot. Consequently, it excretes a lot of urine, about 150 to 280 times its body mass every day. That would be about 2,700 gallons for an average-sized human. The foam creates a kind of cocoon for the young insect to grow, as well as offering protection from birds, wasps and spiders. It has kind of a bitter taste. But the question for scientists was: Does the nymph breathe through those bubbles? No, not usually. The bug sticks the tip of its abdomen up out of the foam as a kind of snorkel. You can see it just breaking the surface. Measurements of carbon dioxide in the bug's environment and oxygen in the bubbles show that it is breathing while it's snorkeling. However, if it's threatened, it sinks down in the bubbles. It doesn't stay there long unless it has to. Then, it pops smaller bubbles to form a larger one that it can breathe though, like an emergency air supply. Then, once the coast is clear, the spittle bug can re-emerge. Eventually, the nymph forms one big bubble, hides inside it and undergoes a transformation to its adult form. But without its bubble home, what does it do about predators? Well, it's a froghopper. It hops. Boy, does it hop.","Spittlebugs feed on plant sap and then excrete bubbly foam to create a protective fortress around themselves. Later, they emerge as adult froghoppers.",553cbe-63b1-594c-b4ae-15e6606e9ba1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/19/autossell/adult-5-025/adult-5-025-facebookJumbo.jpg?video-overlay?video-overlay,Kephra Beckett,553cbe-63b1-594c-b4ae-15e6606e9ba1,N24News/imgs/553cbe-63b1-594c-b4ae-15e6606e9ba1.jpg,2
Global Business,Europe Urged to Share Power Across Continent,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/business/global/13grid.html,"BRUSSELS -- Renewable energy in Europe should be generated and distributed on a continental scale to make the greatest contribution toward reducing greenhouse gases, according to a report that raises significant challenges for a fragmented region. The report, to be released Tuesday, was compiled by the European Climate Foundation, a group financed by philanthropic organizations, using studies carried out by McKinsey, a consulting firm. Among its recommendations is a gigantic power cable that would link solar farms in Spain with energy-hungry countries like Poland. Such a link could ship huge volumes of so-called clean electricity, but it could face political opposition in countries like France. The report underscores how various renewable power sources, including wind from the North Sea, will need to be linked on a transcontinental grid to generate a secure and reliable supply of alternative energy to substitute for fossil fuels.

Such a grid would probably be easier to build in countries that span continents, as in the United States and China. In Europe, power grids remain largely confined to countries, with limited cross-border connections. The report, to be presented in Brussels to the European Union energy commissioner, Gunther Oettinger, and the climate commissioner, Connie Hedegaard, said that cross-border connections would need to change if clean power was to be distributed more widely. ""Transmission must develop from a minor trading and reserve-sharing role to one that enables significant energy exchanges between regions across the year,"" according to the report. The addition of a huge interconnector crossing France could help French utilities export more nuclear power, but it also could cut into those exports by providing customers with an alternative source of electricity. Countries including France would need to ""consider wider regional benefits than is currently the case,"" the report said.

Another factor that could impede the plans is longstanding opposition to unsightly pylons and cables in border areas like the Pyrenees, the mountain range between Spain and France. Current capacity between Spain and France is less than a gigawatt and would have to rise to as much as 40 gigawatts to carry sufficient quantities of solar-generated electricity, the report said. Efforts were needed ""to change public attitudes regarding the construction of large-scale overhead transmission infrastructure,"" it said; otherwise, ""alternative solutions"" to overhead lines over the Pyrenees, like underground and underwater cables, ""may need to be considered."" The European Climate Foundation said it had invited all major European utilities to participate in the study. EDF, which operates nuclear power plants in France, was not involved. A spokeswoman for EDF said it was possible that its subsidiaries were involved in the report, but she had no details. GDF Suez, another French utility with substantial nuclear operations, was involved but did not support the conclusions. A spokeswoman for GDF Suez said she had been unable to obtain an explanation as to why the company had distanced itself from the report. The report also seems to have irritated Alstom, a French engineering company that has a major focus on technology to reduce emissions from electricity plants fueled by coal or natural gas. Alstom participated but did not support the conclusions because it said parts of the report underplayed the role of carbon-capture technologies. A company spokeswoman, Mary Varkados, said Alstom welcomed the report's main findings, but said that ""further work will be needed"" on how to reach goals for lowering emissions.

Major energy companies that signed the final report included Shell, the English-Dutch oil and gas company, and RWE, a German electric utility that in previous years had produced the most carbon dioxide of any company based in the European Union. RWE is participating in efforts to deliver solar-generated electricity from North Africa. The power sector is currently the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in many parts of Europe. The report said the European Union would need to combine solar power from Spain with wind power from the North Sea if it were to meet a pledge made last summer to reduce emissions by 80 percent by 2050. That will be expensive but manageable, according to the report. The European Union already will have to invest 4.2 trillion euros, or $5.7 trillion, across the economy over the next 40 years to ensure it continues to generate sufficient power by midcentury, according to the report. To reach its goal of reducing emissions, the bloc would have to invest a total of 7 trillion euros, or about 66 percent more, it said. But the cost of energy to the economy should start to drop as of 2020 because of reduced fossil fuel use and efficiency savings that would help offset the cost of building a low-carbon infrastructure.",Among the recommendations in a new report: a gigantic power cable to link solar farms in Spain with distant countries like Poland.,9e56e4e1-5d3e-5e25-ae9a-7fb11e11d43c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/04/13/business/global/13grid1/13grid1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=315&w=600&s=b2c2e4de498453f7c689bc455e3cb29cf18a2b584447a999b69da73f7bdd45c3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"A new solar plant in Sanlucar La Mayor, near Seville, Spain.",9e56e4e1-5d3e-5e25-ae9a-7fb11e11d43c,N24News/imgs/9e56e4e1-5d3e-5e25-ae9a-7fb11e11d43c.jpg,24
Media,Female Investors Express Interest in Weinstein Company,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/business/media/weinstein-company-women.html,"LOS ANGELES -- Two female-led investor groups are lining up to save the Weinstein Company, which has been straining to avoid bankruptcy since dozens of allegations of sexual harassment and rape were made against co-owner Harvey Weinstein. Throwing a lifeline to an entertainment company that has become a symbol of the systemic mistreatment of women in Hollywood would seem like the last thing that feminists like Gloria Allred and Ana Oliveira, chief executive of the New York Women's Foundation, would be interested in doing. But each is involved with a group holding separate acquisition talks with the embattled Weinstein Company -- with the aim of benefiting sexual misconduct victims. Their interest underscores the fragile position of the company and the factors beyond mere business considerations that must be addressed if it is to have a future. ""Can we dare to think about seizing these assets to help institute long-term change?"" Ms. Oliveira said in an interview. ""Can the Weinstein Company see the opportunity to go through a social redemption process?""

Neither group is close to making a deal, however, and some longtime media investors and advisers question whether the efforts are more about making a statement than realistically moving the company past its current mess. Ms. Oliveira's organization is affiliated with an acquisition effort being led by Killer Content, a New York company behind art-house films like ""Carol"" and television mini-series including ""Mildred Pierce."" Killer has lined up an investor group that includes Abigail Disney, a documentary filmmaker and philanthropist who is Walt Disney's grandniece, and the futuristic transportation entrepreneur Brogan BamBrogan. In talks with Weinstein Company's sale advisers, the Killer group has proposed a radical notion: It wants to buy parts of the studio -- in particular, several finished films and television projects that are in development -- and give profits to organizations focused on ending harassment, sexual abuse and discrimination. The group calls its plan Project Level Forward. The New York Women's Foundation would also distribute proceeds to other nonprofits. Adrienne Becker, Killer's acting chief executive, declined to comment about the talks, citing a confidentiality agreement. In a statement, she said, ""It appears that there is a conversation that could be had with the interested parties that have a common agenda.""

Ms. Becker was referring to a separate acquisition effort made public in recent days by Maria Contreras-Sweet, who led the Small Business Administration under President Barack Obama and founded ProAmerica Bank. ""I have assembled a first-class team of financial partners, advisors and consultants to put together a proposal,"" Ms. Contreras-Sweet wrote in a letter to the Weinstein Company's three-member board, which includes Harvey Weinstein's brother, Bob Weinstein. In the letter, Ms. Contreras said that she would rename the company and remove Bob Weinstein as chairman as part of a plan to keep it running.

A copy of the letter was sent to The New York Times by Ms. Allred, who said she had consulted with Ms. Contreras-Sweet about an unusual component -- establishing a fund for the women accusing Mr. Weinstein of abuse and a mediation process for reaching settlements. ""Her proposal and the way that it is structured would make 'herstory,'"" Ms. Allred said in an email.
* $15 minimum wage for federal contractors will take effect Jan. 30.
* Jeff Bezos gives $100 million to the Obama Foundation. Ms. Contreras-Sweet, who did not identify her financial backers in her letter, declined to comment. Her team has not yet determined what the Weinstein Company might be worth, according to a person briefed on her effort, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. The company's assets include a handful of finished films, a library of old movies and several television series, including ""Project Runway."" A spokesman for the Weinstein Company did not respond to a request for comment. Through a spokeswoman, Harvey Weinstein has repeatedly denied ""any allegations of nonconsensual sex."" Most experts believe that bankruptcy remains the most likely outcome for the Weinstein Company, in part because its debt is estimated to total at least $375 million -- more than the studio is most likely worth. And then there are the lawsuits. The Weinstein Company was already facing court claims before Harvey Weinstein became the subject of multiple police investigations. The studio, for instance, has been battling a $130 million fraud lawsuit over its dealings with Genius Products, a bankrupt home entertainment company once largely owned by the Weinsteins. The trustee overseeing the Genius Products proceedings on Nov. 2 asked a California bankruptcy judge to freeze any efforts by the Weinstein Company to sell assets.

Now sexual harassment-related lawsuits are arriving, including some filed by Ms. Allred. On Oct. 24, an aspiring actress, Dominique Huett, sued the Weinstein Company in Los Angeles Superior Court, accusing it of negligence. Two other actresses are anonymously suing Harvey Weinstein and the studio on similar grounds. Lawyers representing another actress filed a class-action complaint on Nov. 15 against the studio and other parties in United States District Court for the Central District of California. To stay afloat while it pursues a sale -- the studio employs about 150 people -- the Weinstein Company at first sought loans from Fortress Investment Group, a private equity firm that has lent money to struggling film companies in the past, and Colony Capital, the private equity firm run by Thomas J. Barrack Jr. Those efforts failed. With the clock ticking, the studio decided to sell a prize asset -- North American distribution rights to ""Paddington 2,"" an animated movie produced by Studio Canal, a division of Vivendi SA, and set for release in January. Bob Weinstein had been hoping that ticket sales would be strong enough to stabilize the studio. A sale of the rights to Warner Bros. on Nov. 15 raised about $32 million, which will be shared by the Weinstein Company and Studio Canal. The Weinstein Company has a handful of unreleased movies left, including ""Polaroid,"" a teenage horror movie; ""The War With Grandpa,"" a comedy starring Robert De Niro; ""The Upside,"" a comedy starring Kevin Hart and Bryan Cranston; and ""The Current War,"" a period drama. Box office analysts say prospects are mixed for those films, each of which would require marketing campaigns costing tens of millions of dollars.","Neither of two investor groups is close to a deal, but their interest shows the factors beyond mere business considerations the embattled studio must address.",aa68b757-3408-5960-9e05-f8b4270c0ee6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/22/business/22WEINSTEIN1/22WEINSTEIN1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=dd828db4fbd3c3df26e9fc94d40812eb5ea546b5723eecd07db6cef3d3b33153&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Maria Contreras-Sweet, who led the Small Business Administration under President Barack Obama, is leading an investor group.

Media,"What's Next at Fox News, With Ailes Out and Murdoch In?",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/01/business/media/whats-next-at-fox-news-with-ailes-out-and-murdoch-in.html,"One important thing has been lost in all of the obituaries of Roger Ailes's career at Fox News. The Roger Ailes we know, the one who built a conservative-leaning network from scratch and enforced its philosophy without compromise, would not exist if not for his corporate patron, Rupert Murdoch. Without Mr. Murdoch's nearly unconditional support, Mr. Ailes would never have been able to make Fox News the political-media earthmover it became. It was right at home in Mr. Murdoch's global media business, whose news properties already had a record of nudging -- more like shoving -- politics to the right on at least three continents, often with the same raucous populism that's so identified with Fox. Mr. Murdoch's new role as the interim chief of Fox News, pending the naming of a successor to Mr. Ailes, is a genius move. If there's anyone whose understanding of the network's core audience of older white traditionalists is close to that of Mr. Ailes, it is Mr. Murdoch.

But Mr. Murdoch, 85, is serving as a bridge to something else at Fox News. What that will be rests in part with his two sons, Lachlan, 44, and James, 43. Mr. Murdoch elevated them to top jobs at 21st Century Fox and its sibling News Corp. 18 months ago. They are already putting their own stamp on the (publicly traded) family business, mostly in its non-news -- noncontroversial -- entertainment divisions of television and film. Now, with Fox News, they are finally wading into their father's gladiator pit, where politics is the blood sport. And, to the extent that he defers to their judgment, it could offer the first glimpse of where they would take a media empire that, under Rupert Murdoch, asserted itself into the political ethos of the United States, the United Kingdom and his homeland of Australia in ways not seen since the days of William Randolph Hearst. For now, though, the billion-dollar-plus (a year, in profit) question is whether their involvement in the succession plans at Fox News fundamentally changes a network that has functioned at times as a more influential, conservative presence in American politics than the Republican Party itself. The Murdochs are still in crisis mode at Fox News. The network was rocked yet again on Friday, this time by a devastating article in New York magazine by Gabriel Sherman, who reported that Fox News paid a $3 million settlement to a booker who said Mr. Ailes carried on an abusive 20-year relationship with her -- at times using company resources and personnel to facilitate it. Mr. Ailes denied the charges through his lawyer. It immediately raised new questions about whether the Murdochs would be forced into a bigger house cleaning of Mr. Ailes's remaining team of lieutenants at Fox News, where, it seems, sexual harassment payouts were not followed by the recognition that there just might be a problem, let alone by any obvious attempts to aggressively address the corporate culture that facilitated the behavior in the first place.

Fox News's reporting often tells a much different story. Its hosts don't hesitate to report that ""the science is still in question,"" as Heather Childers recently did, or that warnings about climate change are emanating from ""people aligned with the political left in the scientific community,"" as the host Steve Doocy said in April while promoting a film purporting to debunk climate change. Even before Mr. Ailes's ouster, climate activists were hopeful that James Murdoch would force changes to skeptical coverage of climate change at Fox News, as well as its corporate cousin The Wall Street Journal, whose editorial page has great sway with congressional Republicans. To nudge it along, one group, Partnership for Responsible Growth, has run ads with both outlets reminding Republicans that their leaders used to support market-based solutions to climate change -- and calling on The Journal's editorial page to acknowledge humankind's role. David Fenton, a longtime strategist for progressive causes whose agency, Fenton, made the ads, said its main goal was to push a bipartisan solution in the form of a carbon pricing system. The Murdoch outlets have been standing in the way, he said, by creating a ""false reality bubble denying science"" that scares amenable Republican politicians away from the cause. ""James knows better, and there's no way that someone like that could be happy with the terribly negative role the Murdoch properties have played in slowing bipartisan action on climate,"" Mr. Fenton said. None of the Murdochs would comment for this column. But it's impossible to talk about the intersection of their political and business interests without lingering for a moment on the latter. Even if some of Fox News's programming drives one or both of the brothers bananas, it is still a major cash generator for 21st Century Fox, with $1.6 billion in operating profit in fiscal 2015, according to Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group. Fox News's raison d'etre was to fill a void that conservative-leaning viewers sensed in the mainstream media. That guiding philosophy has provided a steady compass, and a lucrative revenue stream, as its competitors have struggled with their own paths.

That could provide a strong argument against drastic change, especially for the elder Mr. Murdoch, who is by all accounts enjoying his new role running the network and is saying he won't rush into picking a successor to Mr. Ailes. It seems a near certainty that he will stay through the election. With Mr. Murdoch at the helm, the network covered Hillary Clinton's convention in Philadelphia with all the skepticism you'd expect. It didn't show the speech of Khizr Khan, the Muslim father of a fallen American soldier. Then, there was Bill O'Reilly's aside that the slaves who built the White House, whom Michelle Obama referred to in her prime-time address, were ""well fed"" and adequately housed. That said, Fox News's audience tends to be older, which is why executives there indicate that the family views its younger prime-time star, Megyn Kelly, as an important part of its future. Her appeal extends to the core Fox News viewer as well as to those with more mainstream news tastes. Ms. Kelly's contract, like Mr. O'Reilly's, comes up for renewal next year. Before Mr. Ailes left, Ms. Kelly seemed certain to leave. Now it's a given that her decision will depend on how the Murdochs decide to proceed -- as will so, so much else.","Rupert Murdoch as the network's interim chief after Roger Ailes's ouster is a smart move, but Mr. Murdoch's sons may have a hand in the direction of the empire.",8c746c48-8958-564b-8de1-4c6d9945dd49,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/01/business/01rutenberg/01rutenberg-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=7617a5175a095cc4a77734190e76709cdf1a10509e1a2a4e0667914049c69c77&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"As interim chief of Fox News, Rupert Murdoch, center, is serving as a bridge to something else at the political-media powerhouse.",8c746c48-8958-564b-8de1-4c6d9945dd49,N24News/imgs/8c746c48-8958-564b-8de1-4c6d9945dd49.jpg,16
Media,Sumner Redstone's Granddaughter and Ex-Companion Form Alliance,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/business/media/sumner-redstones-granddaughter-and-ex-companion-form-alliance.html,"In yet another twist to an already tangled case, a judge on Wednesday rejected a petition by the granddaughter of the media mogul Sumner M. Redstone to join his former companion in the legal battle over his mental competency.

The petition was made by Keryn Redstone, the 34-year-old daughter of Brent Redstone, Sumner's son. And it essentially puts her in conflict with her aunt, Shari Redstone, who after public disagreements with her father over the years has said that she has reconciled with him.

Keryn Redstone could still act as a witness in the case.

Shari Redstone has spent the last several months challenging the suit, which was filed in November by Manuela Herzer, the former companion and onetime romantic partner of the elder Mr. Redstone. Ms. Herzer asserts that Mr. Redstone, 92, was not mentally competent in October when he removed her from a directive that would have put her in charge of his health care.

A deposition of Ms. Herzer was scheduled for Thursday, but was delayed until next week because her lawyer said she had strep throat.","Keryn Redstone has filed a petition to join the former companion, Manuela Herzer, in the legal fight over the media mogul's mental competency.",7608ab89-1a9f-5966-8b78-1851a4da7377,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/21/business/21redstone/21redstone-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=bc9ba7394025b1d61132971943cf4b54bb406b99fec98b284a5b269bce255903&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sumner Redstone and his daughter, Shari Redstone.

Economy,Nudges Aren't Enough for Problems Like Retirement Savings,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/business/economy/nudges-arent-enough-to-solve-societys-problems.html,"Why don't Americans save more for old age? Even when their employers promise to match their savings, workers often fail to salt away their earnings for the future, inexplicably leaving money on the table. Psychology has offered an answer: procrastination. And it has suggested a cure: rather than giving workers the choice to sign up for a 401(k), sign them up automatically and give them the choice to opt out. The switch has led to a sharp increase in workers' participation in retirement savings plans. It is perhaps the most successful contribution of so-called behavioral economics to public policy. Yet, though lauded by policy makers as a powerful new tool in the policy kit, the approach poses a risk, too. It fosters a belief that tweaks based on an understanding of people's psychology could lead to a vastly improved society at little or no cost to taxpayers.

""The insights from behavioral economics are beautiful from a research perspective,"" said Eldar Shafir, a professor of psychology at Princeton who is an expert on decision-making and a leading proponent of the behavioral approach to economics. ""But its popularity no doubt comes from a combination of lack of funds and political helplessness."" Given Washington's political paralysis, it's no surprise that ""nudges"" like these are all the rage in the Obama administration, which has brought in some leading behavioral experts. In 2009, the White House hired Cass R. Sunstein -- a legal scholar who wrote the book ""Nudge"" with Richard H. Thaler, a behavioral economist. In September, the administration's Social and Behavioral Sciences Team issued its first report extolling the many benefits of applying behavioral insights to policy. Sending text messages to low-income high school graduates about prematriculation requirements for college increased enrollment rates. Well-written emails increased the participation of military service members in the federal employees savings plan. They also bolstered enrollment in health insurance plans under Obamacare. But here is the reality check: We haven't yet nudged ourselves out of a retirement trap. Traditional defined-benefit pensions have all but disappeared in the private sector, but only 40 percent of American families in the bottom half of the income distribution have any form of retirement savings plan. And even among those who have one, their savings total, on average, is just $40,000.

Automatic enrollment in retirement accounts counts as the most successful nudge yet tested on a large scale. It also underscores the limitations of the strategy. America's shortcomings are serious. The United States has the deepest poverty rates among rich countries. It is at the bottom of the pile in terms of infant mortality, obesity and diabetes, and has the highest teenage pregnancy rate among rich members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the club of advanced industrial nations. The death rate from drug overdoses among young white adults is now about as high as the death rate from AIDS was at its peak in the mid-1990s. It's great to know that there are promising ways to improve society by developing a smarter email or changing the default choice on an application form. But if the question is whether policy makers can cheaply nudge Americans out of destitution onto a path to prosperity, the answer must be no. The limits of nudging come into focus in an evaluation by the research firm MDRC of a set of behavioral nudges intended to increase poor fathers' payment of child support for their children.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions.
* $15 minimum wage for federal contractors will take effect Jan. 30. In Franklin County, Ohio, careful reminders increased the share of noncustodial parents who paid support, to 51.5 percent from 48.5 percent. In Cuyahoga County, Ohio, text message reminders increased the payment rate to 49.8 percent from 47.3 percent. In both cases, the researchers observed, the payments were quite small. If the government's objective was to change the landscape of child support -- a critical policy question considering there are 25 million children living with a single parent -- this will not be enough. Policy experimentation is always welcome. But the approach taken in this instance seems to spring from a shaky assumption: Poor noncustodial fathers can afford child support but choose not to pay it. As the MDRC researchers put it, ""the modest findings suggest that the targeted noncustodial parents may have a limited ability to pay."" Dealing with that, however, might cost taxpayers real money.

Other behavioral interventions have run into similar hurdles. A recent study by George Loewenstein, a behavioral economist and noted critic of ""nudges"" from Carnegie Mellon University, with Cazilia Loibl of Ohio State University and two other colleagues, also suggests that fancy cognitive tricks may fail to overcome the main obstacle faced by the poor: a lack of money. They tried several behavioral techniques to persuade poor Americans to take advantage of individual development accounts, savings accounts topped off by the federal government at a rate of $2 for every $1 saved. That's quite a deal. But nothing worked. ""People are not saving because they have such low incomes,"" Professor Loewenstein concluded. This is not to bash behavioral economics. It offers invaluable insights into how real humans depart from the robotic assumptions of most economists, who posit that any rational individual will jump through every hoop to gain a benefit if it exceeds its cost. Emily Schmitt is a senior social science research analyst at the Administration for Children and Families in the Health and Human Services Department. She ran the child support experiments in Ohio along with a dozen others testing how to improve people's access to government programs. She noted that behavioral insights are critical to ensure that the poor gain access to the benefits available to them. ""Unintentional barriers can screen out the people that need programs the most,"" she said. And there is more. If we want to diminish poverty, it is crucial to understand the actions of the poor better.

Experiments by Professor Shafir at Princeton and others have documented how poverty itself leads people to make self-destructive decisions, perhaps by forcing them to focus attention on satisfying immediate needs to the exclusion of other considerations. ""The poor lack two things: money and cognitive freedom,"" Professor Shafir told me. That understanding might act as a corrective for the belief that poor people are mostly to blame for their poverty. And it poses a challenge for those who argue that the government's role should mostly be to curb dependence on public support while exhorting the poor to get their act together, marry, get a job. It could shift the onus onto those with power over poor Americans -- employers, government -- not just to design their application forms, their business hours, their policies in a way that takes into account the restrictions poverty imposes, but also to shift real resources to where they would make the biggest difference. This is hardly a cheap lunch, however. Take retirement savings. The government has encouraged employers to nudge their employees into opening savings accounts. But what if the problem is bigger? What if workers simply cannot assess how much they need to save today to navigate turbulent financial markets and still have a decent nest egg 20, 30 years down the road? In such a case the better response -- drawing from the insights unveiled by behavioral economics -- might be to replace all the tax subsidies and other incentives for so-called defined-contribution pensions with something that works more effectively for more Americans. ""The single biggest contribution of behavioral economics to public policy is taking this flawed approach to retirement savings and making it a little bit more viable,"" Mr. Loewenstein told me. ""The downside is that if we make it just sufficiently viable, people won't recognize how bankrupt the concept is."" Society could be nudged in the wrong way.","Ideas drawn from psychology are helping Americans make better economic choices, but they fail to address problems in areas like retirement savings.",478536fb-3e8f-585f-a1dd-e2df54b57579,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/24/business/24porter/24porter-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=4889a8bcf094b16e194fb45e0f934eb88470e9dfa831c4a8ea41b8c07eb32d62&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"President Obama signed a memorandum to create a new retirement savings account at a steel plant in West Mifflin, Pa., in 2014.",478536fb-3e8f-585f-a1dd-e2df54b57579,N24News/imgs/478536fb-3e8f-585f-a1dd-e2df54b57579.jpg,8
Science,I've Just Seen a (DNA-Generated) Face,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/24/science/dna-generated-faces.html,"The faces here, which look a bit like video game avatars, are actually portraits drawn from DNA. Each rendering was created by plugging an individual genetic profile into a predictive tool created by Mark D. Shriver, a professor of anthropology and genetics at Penn State University. Dr. Shriver and his colleagues have studied the ways that genes influence facial development. Their software yields an image in a matter of minutes, rapidly drawing connections beween genetic markers and points on the face. In less time than it takes to make a cup of coffee, a sketch emerges inferred solely from DNA. How accurate or useful are these predictions? That is something that Dr. Shriver is still researching - and that experts are still debating. Andrew Pollack writes about the issues in an article on genetic sleuthing in Science Times.

On The New York Times's science desk, we wondered whether it would be possible to identify our colleagues based on the formula that Dr. Shriver has developed. So we tried a somewhat unscientific experiment.

John Markoff, a reporter, and Catherine Spangler, a video journalist, each volunteered to share their genetic profile, downloaded from 23andMe, a consumer DNA-testing company. The files we sent to Dr. Shriver did not include their names or any information about their height, weight or age. Dr. Shriver processed the genotype data and sent us renderings of the donors' faces. We distributed the images to colleagues via email and a private Facebook group, and asked them if they could identify these individuals. We told them that because age and weight could not be determined from DNA, the person might be older or younger, heavier or lighter than the image suggested. At least a dozen people immediately responded that they could not guess because the images felt too generic. Among the 50 or so people who did venture guesses, none identified the man as Mr. Markoff, who is 65. The man who received the most votes was Andrew Ross Sorkin, a business columnist and editor of Dealbook. A number of other possibilities were suggested, too -- mostly white men who work on the science desk.

When it came to the computer's DNA portrait of Ms. Spangler, 31, staffers had more luck. About 10 people correctly identified her. Although there was no close second, participants put forth the names of nearly 10 other women. About half of them were of European ancestry, half of Asian ancestry. To build his model, Dr. Shriver measured 7,000 three-dimensional coordinates on the face and analyzed their links to thousands of genetic variants. Though sex and ancestral mix are not the only predictor of face shape in this model, they are the primary influencers -- something that has raised concerns about the potential for racial profiling.","To test the accuracy of DNA-based facial sketches, two Times journalists had scans made and people were asked to guess who the faces belonged to.",103c4664-d2ce-521e-a21c-cbc993a0f020,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/24/health/24faces_otherpeople/24faces_otherpeople-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=a9c7d6234a7390aa30eca7f25f41bf9e64afba19dd86dbbc65e8591e012222d9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Predictions of what people look like using a DNA analysis tool compared with photos of the actual people.,103c4664-d2ce-521e-a21c-cbc993a0f020,N24News/imgs/103c4664-d2ce-521e-a21c-cbc993a0f020.jpg,2
Art & Design,High Museum Acquires 54 African-American Artworks,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/arts/design/high-museum-thornton-dial.html,"The High Museum of Art in Atlanta has the largest collection of Thornton Dial works in the world.

Well,Don't Drink the Hand Sanitizer,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/24/well/live/dont-drink-the-hand-sanitizer.html,"Alcohol-based hand sanitizer can be found in schools, offices, restrooms and restaurants and is great for cleaning hands in public places. But most of us would never think of drinking it. But the products also contain a stronger concentration of alcohol than beer, wine and most hard liquors, and can be easily abused. The issue gained national attention recently when a former Wells Fargo banker admitted to swigging hand sanitizer at work to cope with the stress of working at the bank. A recent ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch also included a joke about the practice. Ingestion of hand sanitizer can cause alcohol poisoning and even death, and the vast majority of those exposed are children under 6 who drink it by accident after finding it in the home or a parent's purse or bag. It's less common for adults who can buy alcohol legally to deliberately ingest hand sanitizer, unless they are in an institution like a hospital or prison where alcohol is not allowed, are trying to commit suicide, or are alcoholics who can't obtain alcohol any other way or are trying to hide their drinking. The problem appears to be on the rise. Last year the nation's poison control center received 19,729 reports of exposure to hand sanitizer, up from 17,821 reports in 2011. But most exposures are accidental and the vast majority involve children who may have just licked their hands after rubbing hand sanitizer on them, tasted it by accident or inhaled it. Only 1,394 of last year's incidents involved intentionally swallowing the liquid, according to the American Association of Poison Control Centers. There were two deaths.

Teenagers who can't buy alcohol legally and are looking for a ""high alcohol content thrill"" are known to occasionally abuse hand sanitizer, said Dr. Anthony F. Suffredini, a physician who wrote a paper describing the case of a 17-year-old hospital patient who became acutely ill after putting hand sanitizer into his feeding tube while being treated for other medical problems. The boy required mechanical ventilation to assist with his breathing and dialysis to rid his blood of the alcohol. ""This young man, who was from the South, mentioned that among his circle of friends, who were all underage, if they couldn't find alcohol any other way, this was one of the ways they tried to get high,"" Dr. Suffredini said. A 2012 study by Dr. Suffredini that examined trends in hand sanitizer incidents from 2005 through 2009 reported an increase in the number of youngsters and adults who said they deliberately drank hand sanitizer. The number of children ages 6 to 19 who said they had deliberately swallowed hand sanitizer more than tripled, to about 350 in 2009, up from just over 100 in 2005. Meanwhile, the number of adults over 20 who said they deliberately drank hand sanitizer increased to just over 200 in 2009, up from about 60 in 2005. While the numbers are small, Dr. Suffredini said he suspects most incidents do not get reported. ""Not everyone will report it and unless someone gets really ill, they won't go to the emergency room, and even then, the emergency room may not report it as a true poisoning,"" he said. Doctors say the case of the Wells Fargo banker, reported in The New York Times, was particularly unusual. The banker, Angie Payden, of Hudson, Wis., said she started drinking hand sanitizer in the bathroom while working at Wells Fargo to cope with the intense pressure to open unnecessary bank accounts, which was causing her to have panic attacks.

Containers of hand sanitizer were kept throughout the bank, she said, on bankers' desks, behind the tellers' counters and in the restroom. Ms. Payden said she drank the hand sanitizer before meeting with clients, and eventually worked up to drinking ""at least a bottle a day"" and realized she was ""completely addicted."" ""It's interesting, because it's not something you hear a lot,"" said Alexander Garrard, a toxicologist who is director of the Washington Poison Center in Seattle, commenting on Ms. Payden's account. ""Hand sanitizer is not usually something people will resort to."" The reason most people shy away from it? ""It just doesn't taste good,"" Dr. Garrard said. ""Nobody who's not an alcoholic is going to say, 'You know what would be really good right about now?' "" and suggest hand sanitizer. Purell hand sanitizer has added unpleasant-tasting ingredients to its products to make them even less palatable, said Samantha Williams, a spokeswoman for GoJo Industries, which makes Purell. She noted that published studies show the benefits of using hand sanitizer, including reduced infections in hospitals and fewer missed work and school days. One appeal of drinking hand sanitizer may simply be that it's easier to conceal, either from parents or from one's boss, said William Eggleston, a clinical toxicologist at Upstate New York Poison Center and an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Upstate Medical University. ""If someone sees a little bottle of hand sanitizer in your purse, nobody's going to think twice,"" Dr. Eggleston said. ""If they see a minibar bottle of vodka in your purse, it will raise questions. So I can see why someone would choose something like this in a high-stress environment."" A study of 385 teenagers who ingested hand sanitizer in Texas between 2000 and 2013 reported that most of them said they drank it by accident, and only 18 percent said they ingested it deliberately. More than 60 percent were boys, and the average age was 15. About 5 percent suffered serious medical outcomes including vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea, throat irritation and drowsiness.

Consuming hand sanitizer can be particularly dangerous, both because the alcohol content is so much higher than in other sources of alcohol, and because some formulas use isopropyl alcohol, or rubbing alcohol, which is extremely potent, Dr. Garrard said. ""You will be more impaired, with a smaller amount,"" he said, which can lead more rapidly to alcohol poisoning. Deaths are rare and unusual enough to be written up in the medical literature: In one paper, published in 2013, physicians from the University of California, San Diego, described the death of a 36-year-old man who showed up at the emergency room extremely intoxicated. Though he appeared to be less intoxicated some four hours later and left, he apparently went into the bathroom of the waiting room and started drinking hand sanitizer. Doctors attempted to resuscitate him after he was found not breathing, but he never regained consciousness and died a week later.

Real Estate,A West Village Penthouse for $25.49 Million,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/22/realestate/west-village-penthouse-sells-for-over-25-million.html,"The latest in a flurry of sales at the Greenwich Lane, an almost blocklong condominium complex on the site of the former St. Vincent's Hospital campus in the West Village, was filed with the city this past week -- a spacious duplex penthouse with a private rooftop terrace that sold for $25,489,849.99 and was the most expensive closed sale, according to public records.

The purchase of the sponsor apartment on the ninth and 10th floors marked the fourth recorded transaction at 145 West 11th Street, off Seventh Avenue. The red-brick and limestone apartment building is the first of five to be completed in the 200-unit project, which also includes five separate townhouses, developed by the Rudin family and Global Holdings.

FXFowle, the architect, preserved some of the red-brick facades from the original hospital campus to better assimilate into the neighborhood within the Greenwich Village Historic District. Thomas O'Brien of Aero Studios was the interior designer, while the landscape architect M. Paul Friedberg and Partners created the formal internal garden, which features a reflecting pool.

""We're about 90 percent sold,"" said Dan Tubb, a sales director for the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which is handling sales, ""so that leaves us with less than 20 units remaining.""","Two new downtown penthouses were the sales of the week — one at the Greenwich Lane in the West Village, and another at the Sterling Mason in TriBeCa.",201ae439-1c05-5b6a-87cd-cf4c620774ce,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/22/realestate/22TICKET/22TICKET-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=d0e50b442bf294ae688cfebfc4d6d1e3cba7e57ade57c1024b63dd556b76f6c1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"145 West 11th Street, one of five condo buildings at the Greenwich Lane.",201ae439-1c05-5b6a-87cd-cf4c620774ce,N24News/imgs/201ae439-1c05-5b6a-87cd-cf4c620774ce.jpg,7

As a member of the press, I had been advised to join the first, which I happily did (what a great name), only to learn upon entering the theater that my fictional role would also be ""member of the press."" There were two of us, tasked with reporting on the event. (Our recap, delivered mostly by my fellow reporter, would turn out to be the only thing resembling a finale.)

Ups and Downs, sectioned off from other groups by bulletin boards on wheels, faced an impending asteroid impact on the Lower East Side. We had to make an evacuation plan. With conflicting interests (we had each received a list of ""traits"") and no designated leader, this was difficult. A ""former scientist"" argued for hiding out underground. Others distributed ""visas"" for relocation to New Jersey. Two ""transit workers"" opted to walk uptown, which for them meant up the stairs and out of the theater. We never saw them again.

Every so often, a siren blared, and red lights flashed. Other groups, we ascertained, were plotting an interplanetary invasion, trying to cure their own ""aging sickness"" and, in the case of a ""hypochondriac"" subgroup, avoiding human contact.

Economy,Fed Plans to Raise Rates in 2018 but Lacks Consensus on Frequency,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/business/economy/fed-rate-increases.html,"Janet L. Yellen, chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, speaking at a news conference at the conclusion of the Fed's two-day policy meeting in December.

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve has entered 2018 without a clear plan for raising its benchmark interest rate and with the added uncertainty of an imminent change in its leadership. An account of the Fed's final meeting of 2017, which the central bank published Wednesday, said officials generally agreed that the Fed should continue to raise its benchmark rate in the new year. But Fed officials expressed a range of views about the frequency of future hikes. Six of the 16 officials on the Federal Open Market Committee predicted during the December meeting that the Fed would raise rates three times in 2018. But six officials predicted two hikes or fewer and four officials predicted the Fed would raise rates at least four times. The decision about how often to raise rates will be made under new management. The Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, plans to leave the Fed in early February; her nominated successor, the Fed governor Jerome H. Powell, is awaiting a Senate confirmation vote.

Last year was the first since the 2008 financial crisis that the Fed articulated a clear plan for monetary policy and stuck with it. The central bank said it would raise rates three times and did exactly that, with the third hike coming in December. The decision at that meeting to raise the benchmark rate into a range between 1.25 percent and 1.5 percent reflected the Fed's optimistic expectations for the economy, the account said. ""Participants saw the outlook for economic activity as having remained strong or having strengthened since their previous meeting, in part reflecting a modest boost from the expected passage of the tax legislation,"" said the account, which was released after a standard three-week delay. Officials saw few serious dangers on the horizon, the account said. Most expected inflation to rebound from a long period of sluggishness and were not overly concerned about rising asset values. The S.&P. 500 stock index has climbed 19 percent over the last year. The Fed also predicted there would be a modest economic boost from the tax cuts President Trump that signed into law at the end of the year. The account said that many officials predicted increases in both consumer and business spending, although they expressed uncertainty about the magnitude.

In the December round of economic projections, the median forecast of Fed officials was that the economy would grow 2.5 percent in 2018, up from a median forecast of 2.1 percent in September. The tax cut was the primary reason for the higher estimate, Ms. Yellen said at a news conference. The estimate reflected the view of Fed officials that the benefits of the $1.5 trillion tax cut will be attenuated by higher interest rates, as the federal government seeks to borrow more money. The account also said that some firms were likely to give the windfall to investors or use the money to pay down debts rather than making the types of investments likely to expand the economy. The internal debate about how quickly to raise rates revolves around the pace of inflation. Last year was the sixth straight year the Fed fell short of its 2 percent inflation target. ""One thing is for certain and that is that inflation has become the most important economic variable steering the Fed's policy,"" wrote Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG. Covid's impact on the supply chain continues. The pandemic has disrupted nearly every aspect of the global supply chain and made all kinds of products harder to find. In turn, scarcity has caused the prices of many things to go higher as inflation remains stubbornly high. Almost anything manufactured is in short supply. That includes everything from toilet paper to new cars. The disruptions go back to the beginning of the pandemic, when factories in Asia and Europe were forced to shut down and shipping companies cut their schedules. First, demand for home goods spiked. Money that Americans once spent on experiences were redirected to things for their homes. The surge clogged the system for transporting goods to the factories that needed them and finished products piled up because of a shortage of shipping containers. Now, ports are struggling to keep up. In North America and Europe, where containers are arriving, the heavy influx of ships is overwhelming ports. With warehouses full, containers are piling up. The chaos in global shipping is likely to persist as a result of the massive traffic jam. No one really knows when the crisis will end. Shortages and delays are likely to affect this year's Christmas and holiday shopping season, but what happens after that is unclear. Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, said he expects supply chain problems to persist ""likely well into next year."" Some officials have sought to suspend rate hikes until inflation shows greater strength. Charles Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, voted against the December rate hike, and said in a post-meeting statement that the Fed needed to demonstrate a commitment to its target. ""I am concerned that too many observers have the impression that our 2 percent objective is a ceiling that we do not wish inflation to breach,"" Mr. Evans said in the statement.

Most Fed officials, however, expressed confidence that continued growth would increase inflation. That group includes the plurality of officials favoring three rates hikes next year. It also includes the minority of officials who are concerned that the Fed may not be raising rates fast enough. They noted that the economy is growing more quickly, money remains easy to borrow and the supply of workers is dwindling -- factors that could fuel faster inflation. One new item on the agenda at the December meeting: Concern about a technical indicator called the yield curve, which compares the interest rates on the different kinds of debt issued by the federal government, which borrows money for periods ranging from one month to 30 years. In general, investors demand higher interest rates on longer-term loans, to compensate for greater uncertainty, but the difference between short-term rates and long-term rates on federal debt has been compressing. When short-term rates exceed long-term rates, the yield curve is said to be ""inverted."" Historically, that has often happened before a recession. Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, voted against the December rate hike. He said in a post-meeting statement that the flattening of the yield curve indicated the Fed was moving too quickly. ""In response to our rate hikes, the yield curve has flattened significantly, potentially signaling an increasing risk of a recession,"" Mr. Kashkari said. The minutes said most Fed officials did not share Mr. Kashkari's concerns, judging instead ""that the current degree of flatness of the yield curve was not unusual by historical standards,"" and that further flattening ""would not necessarily foreshadow or cause an economic downturn.""","Federal Reserve officials agreed that additional rate hikes are coming but disagreed about the frequency of such increases, according to minutes of the December meeting.",fea49cc1-b7fa-5f38-b391-e7fc2fa0e722,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/04/business/04DC-FED/04DC-FED1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=a8fd093c5b6ffb8d55b0f4f16385f580b134a748bf872e7da5f56848100de4ad&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Janet L.

Media,"'7 Rings' Is a Hit for Ariana Grande, and a Knockout for Rodgers and Hammerstein",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/business/media/ariana-grande-7-rings-rodgers-hammerstein.html,"This week, Ariana Grande's ""7 Rings"" hit No. 1 on Billboard's singles chart for the sixth time, the latest victory for a song that broke records when it was released in January and has since been streamed more than a billion times around the world.

But when it comes to royalties for ""7 Rings,"" the biggest winner may be two songwriters who died decades ago: Rodgers and Hammerstein.

Ms. Grande's song is an extended reinterpretation of ""My Favorite Things"" from ""The Sound of Music,"" with Ms. Grande changing the original's lyrics about innocent joys -- ""raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens"" -- to an anthem of empowerment through conspicuous consumption. ""Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles,"" she sings, over a bass-heavy beat. ""Buy myself all of my favorite things.""

The song is credited to a total of 10 writers. But two of them -- Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II -- control 90 percent of the songwriting royalties, a remarkable split that reflects the value of evergreen song catalogs, and of the negotiating leverage their owners have when pop stars come seeking permission.","The company that controls the composers' catalog cut a deal for 90 percent of the royalties for the singer's remake of ""My Favorite Things"" just weeks before its release.",427ba37c-dc98-5515-9d01-d7b72d088c1f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/19/business/19GRANDE-01/19GRANDE-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=e99353067b91f4bcb502136b8d0abd6549c7b4b94cbddd86138b5c8726ba18bc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The company that owns the Rodgers and Hammerstein catalog cut an unusually lucrative deal with Ariana Grande over the rights to her single ""7 Rings,"" an extended reinterpretation of ""My Favorite Things.""",427ba37c-dc98-5515-9d01-d7b72d088c1f,N24News/imgs/427ba37c-dc98-5515-9d01-d7b72d088c1f.jpg,16
Books,Megan Rapinoe Has a Lot More to Say,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/books/megan-rapinoe-memoir-one-life.html,"GREENWICH, Conn. -- Megan Rapinoe, the American soccer player so decorated with medals and trophies that she's practically gilded, has a book coming out on Tuesday. But it's only kind of about sports. Yes, important games are reconstructed and injuries recounted. But readers will also learn about redlining and how Black service members were excluded from the G.I. Bill. She writes about the pay disparity between male and female professional soccer players. And her white privilege makes its first appearance in the prologue: ""A small, white, female soccer player -- even a lesbian one with a loud voice and pink hair -- lands differently in the press than, say, a six-foot-four-inch Black football player with an Afro."" Absent from the book are the standard admonishments that if you just work hard enough, you will, somehow, become a professional athlete. ""You know who else works hard?"" Rapinoe writes. ""Everyone."" Indeed, her memoir, ""One Life,"" tracks the arc of her political awakening at least as much as it follows the path of her sports career. In the book, we find a thoroughly modern athlete who plays hard and wins a lot of games, then funnels her public profile and social-media following into activism, not just endorsements.

""There's nothing that I could tell someone about my journey as an athlete that would help them become an elite athlete,"" Rapinoe said in an interview last month, a bright blue beanie pulled over the pandemic haircut she received from her fiancee, the W.N.B.A. star Sue Bird. ""I wanted to write this book because there's so much more happening here than the sports,"" she added, ""and I think we can use that as a vehicle to really talk about what I see as the most important work in my life, which is all the stuff we're doing off the field."" Rapinoe, 35, has been playing soccer professionally for more than a decade, but she burst into national consciousness in 2016. That was the year when she followed Colin Kaepernick in taking a knee during the national anthem, and when she filed a federal complaint, with four of her teammates, against the United States Soccer Federation for wage discrimination.

As she writes in the book, even though the women's team has won far more games and titles than the American men, a top women's player could expect to earn less than half what a comparable player on the men's squad makes.

But as an athlete, her public profile has certainly been helped by the women's team's success. Rapinoe has an Olympic gold medal and two FIFA World Cup title medals, which she thinks are under some paperwork in her office in Seattle. After last year's World Cup victory in France, there were TV interviews, magazine covers and a ticker-tape parade, and the team was presented with the keys to New York City. She also caught the ire of President Trump on Twitter when she said that she would refuse an invitation to celebrate their win at the White House. With all that came the chance for Rapinoe to write a book. By her own admission, she does not hold her liquor terribly well, and she rolled into a day of meetings with publishers nursing a hangover after a friend convinced her to end a night at the Tribeca restaurant Marc Forgione with an ill-advised shot of Chartreuse. The last meeting of the day was with Ann Godoff, the Penguin Press founder who has edited writers like Ron Chernow, Zadie Smith, Michael Pollan and Karl Ove Knausgaard. Not the kind of person who would seem a natural fit for a traditional sports memoir. Yet Godoff saw Rapinoe's story as one of transformation from athlete into activist, and she thought her life would appeal to a wide swath of people. ""To tell you the truth, I went after this, and I don't really do that very much any more,"" Godoff said. Particularly appealing to Godoff, a gay baby boomer, was how out and proud Rapinoe has been. ""We can do something for a generation much younger than you and much, much younger than me,"" she recalled saying to Rapinoe. ""If I had read this book as a 13-year-old girl,"" Godoff added, ""something would have changed for me. And I think we'll have that."" The title of Rapinoe's book, ""One Life,"" was Godoff's suggestion; it comes from the Mary Oliver poem ""The Summer Day."" (""Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?"") Godoff edited her, too.

She connected Rapinoe with the author and journalist Emma Brockes, who agreed to ghostwrite the story. They spent two days at a Sheraton hotel in Orlando and many hours on the phone, as Brockes absorbed Rapinoe's life story and learned to channel her voice -- though Rapinoe is not shy about cursing, and that had to be winnowed down. ""She agreed she'd give me everything she could and then withdraw or redact stuff,"" Brockes said. ""When it came to it, she was incredibly open and honest and very little came out -- nothing really. We just took down the [expletive] count.""

Brockes also spoke extensively with Rapinoe's family, especially her fraternal twin sister, Rachael, and spent time with their mother, Denise, whom Brockes -- the mother of twin girls herself -- has subsequently called for parenting advice. Rapinoe was raised in Redding, Calif., a conservative town where her mother worked as a waitress and her father, Jim, worked in construction. Denise is described as the lodestar of a big, loud family, full of opinions and advice -- Rapinoe has ""Mammers,"" her mother's nickname, tattooed on her left wrist. (In true 2020 style, it was a stick-and-poke tattoo given to her by a W.N.B.A. referee on her last night in the league's bubble.) Rapinoe is also open in the book about the ongoing drug addiction of her brother, Brian, who has spent years in and out of prison. He is described with great tenderness and an eye toward the systems that have contributed to his troubles. ""The way people serving time are spoken of reminds me of the myth peddled by right-wing politicians -- that the only difference between the rich and the poor is the latter's own fecklessness,"" Rapinoe writes. ""If you are a 'repeat offender,' it's not because of structural failings within the system, just as if you are a drug addict, it's not because opioid manufacturers aggressively marketed their drugs at you until you were hooked. Instead, you are in jail, or an addict, because that is, at root, who you are.""

She is candid about her romantic life, chronicling relationships with, among others, Abby Wambach, a former teammate who is now married to the writer Glennon Doyle. As told in the book, when Rapinoe arrived at college and realized she was a lesbian, her life suddenly made sense. ""Clearly I'm gay and why didn't anyone tell me?"" was her first thought, she wrote. ""And number two: This is awesome."" The relationship that gets the most attention is her partnership with Bird. Since leaving the W.N.B.A. bubble -- in which Bird's team, the Seattle Storm, won this year's championship -- the couple has been living in Greenwich, Conn., where they have been swimming, using a Tonal, which is like a high-tech Murphy bed version of a weight machine, and riding their Peloton. Despite being one of the most decorated soccer players in the country, Rapinoe says she's not so good at the Peloton. When the output of the thousands of users who participate in each ride are displayed, she said she consistently hovers around the bottom 30 percent. But before heading to Greenwich, Rapinoe and Bird took a trip with some friends to Antigua, where they got engaged. Rapinoe was lounging on the side of a pool, and when she went to stand up, somebody said it looked like she was kneeling. She hadn't planned on proposing just then, she said, but she'd been thinking about it daily for months, and there was no real question for either of them that they would eventually get married. ""We locked eyes, and I thought, this is definitely the moment,"" she said. So Rapinoe, who wears a lot of jewelry, took a simple gold band off her own finger and proposed. A picture of that moment went viral. Even former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. retweeted it and offered his congratulations. No such congratulations were forthcoming from Mr. Trump.","Don't expect the usual bromides about hard work and resilience in ""One Life.""

Media,"Peter Rice, Fox's Un-Hollywood TV Boss, Is Getting More Say Over What You Watch",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/business/media/peter-rice-fox-disney.html,"Peter Rice, the president of 21st Century Fox, will leave Rupert Murdoch's empire after three decades to take charge of the Walt Disney Company's TV division.

Peter Rice, Fox's Un-Hollywood TV Boss, Is Getting More Say Over What You Watch

Hollywood executives are not so different from the stars they employ. They want to be seen in the right booths at the right restaurants. They work the room at the after-parties on awards nights. And they would rather die than drop a spot on The Hollywood Reporter's annual power list. Peter Rice, who was named the chairman of Walt Disney Television on Monday, avoids that kind of showboating. Mr. Rice, 51, became the president of 21st Century Fox a little more than a year ago, after working at various Fox divisions for nearly three decades. He might have stayed indefinitely, if it were not for the Walt Disney Company's surprise acquisition of the majority of the Rupert Murdoch-owned company, a deal that shareholders approved over the summer. When regulators sign off on the $71.3 billion transaction, expected in the next few months, Mr. Rice will take charge of the combined television assets of two companies that were immense even before they merged. Although he will become perhaps the most powerful executive in the industry -- he will oversee a broadcast network, a collection of cable channels and an enormous studio -- his understated demeanor is unlikely to change.

Associates described him as ""even-tempered,"" ""affable"" and ""cryptic."" During work meetings, he favors the Socratic method, and he is not afraid of silence, often allowing long pauses that some lieutenants describe as intimidating and intentional. He seems most at ease when he is marking up the erasable whiteboard walls that line his office, or spending time with his wife and children at their home in Hidden Hills, a gated suburb in the far reaches of the San Fernando Valley. Disney's announcement of Mr. Rice's new job specified that he will report directly to Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive. For the first time in his career, Mr. Rice's boss will be someone other than a Murdoch. The appointment also means his name is very likely to be bandied about in one of Hollywood's favorite parlor games: Who will run the Magic Kingdom when Mr. Iger's contract comes to an end in three years? If that kind of talk is to gain any traction, though, Mr. Rice would have to distinguish himself at a company that usually promotes from within. He would also have to prove himself superior to a pair of longtime Disney executives in their 50s: Kevin Mayer, who runs the company's portfolio of streaming services and international media operations, and Bob Chapek, the chairman of its theme parks and consumer products.

The job won't be easy. Mr. Rice will be responsible for the countless hours of television content filling the schedules of the broadcast and cable networks that have long been in the Disney family, as well as the various Fox channels that were already part of his purview. That means ABC, Fox, Freeform, Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD, Freeform, the National Geographic Channel and FX, not to mention the two companies' combined TV studios, leaving Mr. Rice in charge of an exceedingly wide range of fare -- everything from ""Atlanta"" to ""Puppy Dog Pals."" His brief will include fixing ABC, which has consistently finished in last place among the four broadcast networks, and improving the fortunes of the sagging Disney Channel. Disney is also counting on Mr. Rice and his team to find shows that will attract subscribers to Hulu -- Disney will be the majority owner when the deal is official -- and a new streaming service scheduled to go live next year. While Disney has signaled that it will welcome the programs it is to inherit as part of its purchase of Fox, something like the FX series ""American Horror Story"" -- which marketed its new season with a grotesque image of a devil's hand reaching for a baby -- may be a tricky fit for the family-friendly empire. This is a company, after all, that uses songs like ""Under the Sea"" from ""The Little Mermaid"" as the hold music on its telephone system. Tom Rothman, a former Fox executive who runs Sony's Motion Picture Group, said he believed Mr. Rice is up for the challenge.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""Peter can do that nearly impossible thing, which is to mix genuine creative vision with business acumen,"" Mr. Rothman said. ""Every significant decision in these senior jobs involves both of those skills, and that kind of integrated intelligence is really rare.""

After graduating from the University of Nottingham in 1989 with a degree in American studies, Mr. Rice joined the 20th Century Fox marketing department and later worked as an executive on blockbusters like ""Independence Day"" and the first ""X-Men"" film. Many of his colleagues have noted his easy rapport with the Murdochs. And a family connection is what led to him to Fox. ""The boss had a huge admiration for Peter's dad,"" said David Hill, a former top Fox Sports executive. He added that Rupert Murdoch ""loves thoroughbreds, and obviously understands blood lines."" Mr. Rice's father, Tom Rice, was an official with the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union, which cooperated with Mr. Murdoch in 1986 as he defied organized labor during his ultimately successful efforts to move the printing and publishing operations of his News International company from Fleet Street to London's Wapping district. A searing event in British press and labor history, the move set off violent protests. Afterward, Tom Rice entered the Murdoch corporate fold, eventually becoming the managing director of News International in Ireland. He died in 2009.

While his father worked for Mr. Murdoch in Dublin, Mr. Rice was on the rise in the mogul's Los Angeles operation, helping to reel in talented up-and-comers like the director Baz Luhrmann. In 2000, Fox named Mr. Rice the president of its specialty film division, Fox Searchlight. He turned the unit into an Oscar and box-office superpower, delivering one idiosyncratic hit after another, most made for budgets of under $15 million -- an achievement that remains his biggest. The movies released during his Fox Searchlight tenure included ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" ""Napoleon Dynamite,"" ""Sideways,"" ""28 Days Later,"" ""The Last King of Scotland,"" ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and ""Juno."" ""His support can feel like prevailing winds in your sails,"" said Jason Reitman, who directed ""Juno,"" which took in $231 million worldwide in 2007 and was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning one for Diablo Cody's screenplay. ""I've never had an unthoughtful conversation with him."" For much of the last decade, Mr. Rice has been in charge of the company's TV assets, not including Fox News. He increased the budget for FX, and it attracted top creators like Donald Glover (""Atlanta""). At the same time, the Fox TV studio created hits for Fox channels and other networks, including ""The Americans"" (FX), ""Empire"" (Fox), ""This Is Us"" (NBC), ""Modern Family"" (ABC) and ""Homeland"" (Showtime). ""He starts off at 20th Century Fox as a cadet and he just gets bigger and bigger,"" said Mr. Hill, the former Fox executive, who credited Mr. Rice for having a deft touch with actors, producers and directors, as well as a ""total understanding of the underpinning revenue."" His resume is not without blemishes, however. In 2006, while running Fox Searchlight, he created a film subdivision geared for young adults, Fox Atomic. Its few successes, like the horror sequel ""28 Weeks Later,"" were eclipsed by a parade of duds: ""The Rocker,"" ""Miss March,"" ""12 Rounds."" Fox Atomic went up in a mushroom cloud in 2009. Another mark against him is that the Fox broadcast network has had trouble finding sustainable hits in recent years.

Mr. Rice remained at Fox even as other companies sought him out. After the Sony Corporation talked to him last year as part of its search for a new head of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Fox gave Mr. Rice a five-year contract extension and promoted him to president of 21st Century Fox, a job that did not include oversight of Fox's film companies. What Mr. Rice did not know at the time was that Mr. Murdoch and his sons, Lachlan and James, had already entered into talks with Disney. Taking his overall record into account, his next employer is betting that Mr. Rice's approach to television has a better chance at success than the plan Disney had in place before it agreed to buy Fox. Mr. Rice will not be going it alone on his journey from Fox to Disney: Accompanying him will be John Landgraf, the head of FX; Dana Walden, the co-chief executive of the Fox television group; and Gary E. Knell, the head of National Geographic Partners. Disney is counting on Team Rice to deliver hits at a time when the competition has never been greater, particularly in children's television, now that Netflix has become a major draw for young viewers. Navigating Disney's buttoned-up culture may be a challenge for some Fox alumni, who will leave behind the less structured working environment fostered by Mr. Murdoch. But Mr. Rice's general bearing -- keep your head down and your ego in check -- is probably a good fit for an organization that values executives who do not carry themselves as if they are bigger than the company they work for.","Like his father before him, Mr. Rice was a Rupert Murdoch loyalist.

Dance,"In a Rare Visit, Three Chances to Impress",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/arts/dance/the-royal-new-zealand-ballet-comes-to-new-york.html,"When the Royal New Zealand Ballet opened at the Joyce Theater on Wednesday night, it was a homecoming -- not for the 61-year-old company, which hasn't been in New York since 1993, but for its artistic director since 2011, a recently retired star of American Ballet Theater, Ethan Stiefel. Before an audience packed with ballet notables, Mr. Stiefel showed what he's been up to, introducing his dancers through three recent works chosen for variety.

Benjamin Millepied created ""28 Variations on a Theme by Paganini"" for the School of American Ballet in 2005. Set to a recording of the Brahms piano pieces of the title, the work sends five couples aswirl in a suggestion of a ballroom. It looks like an apprentice piece, fluent and busy, with pro forma pools of wistfulness and hints of interpersonal drama, but it's this etude quality and the variation structure that make it an effective display for a company in the process of remodeling.

I don't know what these dancers looked like before Mr. Stiefel got his hands on them, but they're spruce now, with pleasing manners and crisp classical technique. Where Mr. Millepied catches the music, they do, too. The women look particularly good: the springy Lucy Green, the sweet Tonia Looker. It's telling that they do not pale in the presence of a world-class ballerina dancing flawlessly: the Ballet Theater principal, guest artist and fiancee of Mr. Stiefel, Gillian Murphy.

""Of Days"" was created last year, at Mr. Stiefel's request, by the former New Zealand Ballet dancer Andrew Simmons. As a sample of native talent, it's disappointingly generic, though as a representative of contemporary ballet, it works fine. To a sampling of meditative contemporary classical recordings that sound as though you've heard them before, even if you haven't, Mr. Simmons mixes classical steps with undulant torsos, a preponderance of portentous walking and unspecific emotion. Themes of mirroring and ghosting, along with silent interludes of compasslike geometry, show promise without delivering.","The Royal New Zealand Ballet began its New York run with three works chosen by Ethan Stiefel, its artistic director.",08794998-baba-54d0-b36b-6a8211c14055,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/14/arts/ROYAL_SPAN/ROYAL-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=395&w=600&s=5583a10c8020441ff015785963b843bcbc0715098e6623a05faf510fb76f8a4b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Royal New Zealand Ballet  performing Javier De Frutos's ""Banderillero"" at the Joyce Theater.",08794998-baba-54d0-b36b-6a8211c14055,N24News/imgs/08794998-baba-54d0-b36b-6a8211c14055.jpg,6
Technology,How to Find the Video Games of Your Youth,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/technology/personaltech/find-old-video-games.html,"The classics can take you back in time -- and are probably easier to recapture than you think.

Video games hit their 60th birthday in October, if you start counting (as many do) with Tennis for Two, a rudimentary Pong ancestor cobbled together by the physicist William A. Higinbotham at Long Island's Brookhaven National Laboratory. Games have evolved a lot since then, of course, becoming far more complicated and visual, as well as multiplayer. Yet sometimes you just want to play an old favorite. Why seek out an ancient game with rudimentary graphics and only basic actions? For some, it's pure nostalgia, like reading a beloved picture book again. For others, old games are a way to share a link to their childhood with a child of their own. Video game companies have caught on to the urge. Nintendo sells throwback consoles preloaded with its vintage games, as do Atari, Sony and others.

Find an Old Game for New Devices Many developers have moved the original game code to app stores for tablets and smartphones. For example, you can play Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog on an Android or iOS device, although you may have to shell out a few bucks to play ad-free or advance to higher levels. In addition, some game companies with extensive archives have versions of old games that run on their latest hardware. Dragon Ball Z: Super Butoden and Omega Fighter, for example, are on sale for less than $10 on the Nintendo Switch, the company's hybrid handheld-console system.

Steam has a larger library (and, for $20, access to the Atari Vault of 100 golden-age classics). But both platforms offer games that can be played on Windows and Mac computers. Not all games work on every desktop system and prices vary, but you can find 1990s favorites like Baldur's Gate for $20, Star Wars: X-Wing for $10 or 2003's EVE Online for free.

If you still have a Windows machine with a disc drive, installing and running the games in Compatibility Mode sometimes works. Using emulation software is an alternative. There is a variety of emulation software, like the open-source DOSBox program for Windows, Mac and Linux, a popular option for getting old DOS games to run on modern hardware. DOSBox also works with many games downloaded from GOG.com. But be careful. The web is full of ""old games"" sites offering downloads, and some are dodgy malware traps. The DOS Games Archives promises clean shareware, freeware and public-domain software. And tech-savvy Raspberry Pi owners can turn that $35 computer into a retro game console, limiting the reach of any PC malware . (The Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, has a detailed guide on turning the Pi into a game console.) Pac-Man, first released into video arcades in 1980, is still one of the most recognized games around, even in the smartphone era. Fortnite and Minecraft may dominate the game world today, but for sheer persistence and a huge dose of 1980s nostalgia, you can still find the iconic arcade wonder Pac-Man on just about every hardware platform around. The munching yellow head with the distinctive waka-waka-waka sound even got a fully playable Google Doodle in 2010 on its 30th anniversary. Amazon's Alexa speaker now has a ""choose your own adventure"" audio version called Pac-Man Stories -- proving, perhaps, that the classics find a new audience in every generation.",The classics can take you back in time — and are probably easier to recapture than you think.,782e715a-ded5-5fe6-aa69-edd888dd80ad,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/01/technology/personaltech/1techtipART_01/24techtipART_01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=fb50948cfd470c027f04bc49dd07e7a0e676347349aac79abf1e42c1d10c1e8f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sonic the Hedgehog, made for the Sega Genesis system back in 1991, comes in a touchscreen version for the iPad and other tablets.",782e715a-ded5-5fe6-aa69-edd888dd80ad,N24News/imgs/782e715a-ded5-5fe6-aa69-edd888dd80ad.jpg,20
Travel,Forget Love. I'm Looking for Great Soup Dumplings.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/travel/solo-travel-dating-apps.html,"Link Salas, the creative director for a small technology company in New York, said he used Grindr, a social networking app for gay, bisexual, and transgender men, to learn about the places he's traveling to and to meet men there. ""I change my profile to say I am in town and looking for someone to show me around,"" he said. ""Some guys suggest a gay neighborhood to check out or a club,"" he said. Some offer to meet in person. ""The way you phrase your paragraph affects the responses you get,"" he said.

The gay dating app Scruff also recently started a new service for its users, Scruff Venture, in which travelers can search more than 500 destinations, and then contact local ""venture ambassadors"" for advice on where to go and what to do.

And while many solo travelers may indeed be single, and thus potentially open to romantic encounters, still others are on their own because their spouses or partners are back at home, unable to make this trip.

That's one factor that in 2016 led the dating site Bumble to expand its offerings to friendship (Bumble BFF) and, in 2017, to work-related connections (Bumble Bizz). Jess Carbino, a sociologist working for Bumble, said the company's research showed that more of its users were using the app to meet local residents when traveling solo. ""People in their 20s and 30s are in different places in their lives, so it can be hard to find someone to travel with,"" she said.

Of course, personal safety is always a concern for solo vacationers. ""When you don't know the area and don't have friends there, it's even more important to be cautious,"" Ms. Castillo said. She said she always shares with a close friend the name and phone number of the person she is going to meet, where they are going and when she expects to be back at her hotel.",Some solo travelers are turning to dating apps like Tinder and Bumble as a convenient way to get advice on where to eat and where to go when visiting an unfamiliar destination.,a2d156e7-e194-5d18-b14d-a80e179da19a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/16/travel/16tindertravel1/16tindertravel1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=7ba5ad8c1e3a2043bf4de8e6d39053c80eea7952417fbbb374acb4072c8f115d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Link Salas, the creative director for a small technology company in New York, said he used Grindr to learn about the places he's traveling to and to meet men there.",a2d156e7-e194-5d18-b14d-a80e179da19a,N24News/imgs/a2d156e7-e194-5d18-b14d-a80e179da19a.jpg,4
Real Estate,A Sign of the Times: More For-Rent Notices in Manhattan,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/realestate/commercial/for-lease-vacant-storefronts-manhattan.html,"Dusty windows on Madison Avenue. Ghostly traces of signs on Columbus Avenue. Graffiti on a shop in SoHo. Manhattan's top retail strips, some of which are among the world's priciest shopping districts, appear to have seen better days. Once-packed streets are being hit by competition from emerging neighborhoods, and deep discounting from online retailers, according to community officials, landlords and brokers. ""Retailers are experiencing painful adjustments right now, there's no doubt about it,"" said Rafe Evans, a longtime broker with the firm Walker, Malloy and Company. He added that he had struggled to fill some Upper West Side buildings with tenants that last more than a few years.

While middle-class neighborhoods may be enjoying healthy vacancy levels, generally defined as about 5 percent, the rate in more affluent areas is as much as 20 percent, according to a survey of major streets that brokers later confirmed. ""It's like what's going on with luxury condos -- foreign money is taking a breather because of what's happening with our politics,"" said Charles Arnold, an agent seeking a tenant for a 2,200-square-foot store at 605 Madison Avenue, a brick building with gold filigree near East 58th Street. It is being listed at $1,200 a square foot annually, or $220,000 a month.

The space has been available for a year, after Mulberry, a British company that sells leather handbags, closed after a nine-year run, said Mr. Arnold, a managing member of the Misra Group of Companies. Two retail floors upstairs, which formerly housed a hair salon and fitness studio run by the celebrity stylist Julian Farel, are also empty. Excess supply, of course, tends to soften prices. And the heart of Madison's shopping district, from East 57th to East 77th Street, where boutiques feature jewelry, suits and stiletto boots, is not immune. In late February, the street had 37 vacancies or stores for rent.

As recently as 2016, annual retail rents averaged $1,800 a square foot, said Faith Hope Consolo, the chairwoman of the retail leasing division at Douglas Elliman Real Estate. Now the average is $1,100, she said. Ms. Consolo is marketing 901 Madison, a store that until last month was leased by Bardith, an antiques store that had been there for more than four decades. The store, near East 72nd Street, is asking $775 a square foot. ""There is just too much space coming to the market at the same time, and owners are all vying for the same retailers,"" Ms. Consolo said. She added that places like Hudson Yards, a neighborhood that barely existed a few years ago and that is still under development, had pulled tenants away. When spaces do get filled on the street, it can feel like a game of musical chairs, Ms. Consolo noted. Bottega Veneta, the Italian leather company, is set to open a new store at 740 Madison this year, though its current store, at 650 Madison, will close at that point, pouring more square footage onto the market.

One afternoon last month, for-rent signs could be seen in front of more than a dozen spaces, including buildings once occupied by marquee fashion companies like Jimmy Choo (No. 407), Marc Jacobs (No.385) and Ralph Lauren (Nos.381 and 383). ""It's a difficult time for all retailers,"" said Dean Valentino, a managing director at ABS Partners Real Estate, which is listing 381 Bleecker for about $500 a square foot, or $50,000 a month. Over a 10-year span, Mr. Valentino said, some rents on the street swelled to $32,000 a month from $20,000 a month, or a 60 percent jump, although stores resisted passing along those extra costs to customers. ""They couldn't escalate the price of their goods as much,"" he said. High levels of pedestrian traffic also don't seem to guarantee retail success, as is the case along Broadway in SoHo, which may be Manhattan's hardest-hit area. About 20 of the 100 storefronts between Houston and Canal Streets sat empty on a recent afternoon, while throngs of people passed outside.

Some of the empty storefronts, on Broadway and elsewhere, may be targeted for development, explaining why they are unoccupied. But the vacancy totals would be even higher if one includes buildings where signs announce incoming retailers but that are still not open for business. Prices in SoHo, unsurprisingly, are in decline. Last fall, the average asking rent on Broadway was $755 a square foot, down from $824 last spring, or about an 8 percent drop, according to the Real Estate Board of New York, the trade group known as Rebny.

If examples are numerous, solutions can seem limited. The Small Business Jobs Survival Act, which would give retail tenants the right to renew any lease so they cannot be evicted on the whim of the landlord, has not made much progress in New York's City Council since being introduced in 2014. While critics have questioned the legality of getting involved in rent negotiations, advocates of the bill say landlords are lobbying behind the scenes to kill it. ""It's obvious that nothing will happen with this bill under the Bill de Blasio administration,"" said Kirsten Theodos of Take Back NYC, a grass-roots coalition she co-founded two years ago. ""I was seeing all these businesses come and go, and would say: 'Oh, my gosh, we just lost a bar. Oh, my gosh, we just lost this cool and funky store,'"" said Ms. Theodos, who lives near the East Village.

Justin Levinson, a former reporter who became frustrated by the high turnover in the East Village, decided the best way to call attention to the issue was visually, with a map. The result, Vacant New York, which he introduced in September, is more a snapshot in time than a dynamic database. But its findings have led him to a meeting with city officials, he said, as well as talks with a real estate brokerage. ""It's really easy to point fingers, to say it's someone's fault, like greedy landlords,"" Mr. Levinson said. ""But no one is really talking about solutions."" For his part, Mr. Levinson would like to see a law creating a registry for all stores that have been vacant for a year. Shopping habits may be harder to change. As long as people keep buying clothes, books and groceries online, from sites like Amazon.com, bricks-and-mortar retailers may continue to have a hard time, said Mr. Evans of Walker Malloy. Along Columbus, where Mr. Evans frequently works, the vacancy rate is about 10 percent, even though the stretch was nearly fully occupied in 2013, he said. And in late February, Rain Africa, which sold natural lotions and soaps at 294 Columbus, shuttered its store after just three years. But the 920-square-foot corner space, at West 74th Street, is close to being leased to a new tenant, as are two other empty stores nearby, Mr. Evans said, adding that a wine bar is also scheduled to open, in the vacant 322 Columbus. ""It looks like things are finding a balance,"" he said.","Vacant storefronts abound as shoppers buying clothes, books and groceries online are bringing hard times to retailers.",857b731b-1673-5cab-a22e-8a7896db7dc2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/08/business/08manhattansqft1/08manhattansqft1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=de7e213cece3602f22167253260f5b43c3a6f3f76cbdbc40979bfdefe7277cb3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Graffiti on a SoHo storefront.

Health,Going to the Emergency Room Without Leaving the Living Room,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/08/health/older-patients-community-paramedics.html,"Going to the Emergency Room Without Leaving the Living Room

For a while, paramedics were rushing Maria Vitale to the emergency room at Long Island Jewish Medical Center every few weeks. ""It was constant,"" said her son, Paul Vitale. ""She would fall, and the ambulance would come and take her to the hospital. Her blood sugar would be low, and she'd go to the hospital."" Like most older people, Mrs. Vitale, now 88, wanted to continue living in her home, a Cape Cod house on Long Island that she and her late husband bought 60 years ago. And, like many older people, she contended with an array of chronic diseases: diabetes, kidney disease, a heart arrhythmia, dementia.

Her children (and Medicaid) had managed to keep her at home with full-time aides, but every 911 call led to hours of waiting in the emergency department, often followed by admission to the hospital. ""Sometimes we felt like the hospitalization hurt her,"" said Mr. Vitale, 60, a health care executive who too often found himself driving from his Manhattan home to Long Island in the middle of the night. ""She came home worse than when she went in."" Since March 2015, however, paramedics have visited Mrs. Vitale's home 10 times, and whisked her to the hospital just once. When Mrs. Vitale falls or seems lethargic or short of breath, her aides no longer call 911. They dial the House Calls service at Northwell Health, the system that includes Long Island Jewish Medical Center and that dispatches what it calls community paramedics. They often arrive in an S.U.V. instead of an ambulance. And with 40 hours of training in addition to the usual paramedic curriculum, they can treat most of Mrs. Vitale's problems on the spot instead of bustling her away.

""A lot of what's been done in the E.R. can safely and effectively be done in the home,"" said Karen Abrashkin, an internist with the House Calls program and Mrs. Vitale's primary care physician. For frail, older people with many health problems, Dr. Abrashkin noted, ""the hospital is not always the safest or best place to be."" Geriatricians have warned for years about the ways in which hospitalization can accelerate older patients' decline, even when physicians succeed in fixing the medical problem at hand. Emergency rooms often serve as gateways to longer stays, and the time spent in bed leads quickly to deconditioning. Older people who walked in on their own often cannot walk out, and need rehab and physical therapy to try to regain their mobility. They're also vulnerable to hospital-acquired infections, including the rampant C. difficile, that can prove difficult to eradicate. Newly prescribed medications can interact badly with those they already take. Delirium strikes as many as half of hospitalized older patients, studies have shown; it's especially common among the cognitively impaired. Mrs. Vitale perceived nonexistent threats, for example. ""She'd be telling me there was a dog under her bed or someone trying to get into her room,"" Mr. Vitale said. For all these reasons, plus the sky-high costs of emergency medicine and hospitalization, community paramedic practices are multiplying across the country.

In 2009, when Medstar Mobile Healthcare began enrolling patients in Fort Worth, it was one of four emergency services in the nation to adopt community paramedicine (sometimes called mobile integrated health care), said Matt Zavadsky, a company spokesman. By 2014, when the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians surveyed the field, it identified more than 100 such services. The association now knows of 260. Differing state regulations mean that these efforts take many forms. In Fort Worth, Medstar Mobile makes mostly scheduled visits, not emergency calls; its paramedics (called mobile health care providers) more often help patients learn to manage their chronic illnesses. When a diabetic has low blood sugar, Mr. Zavadsky said, ""we can administer IV dextrose, or make them a good dinner."" What the programs share are the additional training, a team approach and an emphasis on preventing unnecessary transport. ""The concept of using your E.M.S. people to keep people out of the hospital is common to all of them,"" said Dan Swayze, the vice president of the Center for Emergency Medicine of Western Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh. The concept may spread even faster if insurers, particularly Medicare and Medicaid, would cover at-home treatment by paramedics. Right now, emergency services are reimbursed only for ferrying people to hospitals. ""If we only pay to transport people, guess what we're going to do,"" Mr. Zavadsky said. That could change, though. Medstar Mobile and other programs are negotiating with insurance companies for reimbursement for at-home services, instead of relying on foundation grants, referral payments and hospital budgets. Supporters are also pressing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to change its policies.

Northwell Health's community paramedics program published its results this summer in The Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, looking at outcomes for 1,602 ailing, homebound patients (median age: 83) over 16 months. When the community paramedics responded -- most commonly for shortness of breath, neurological and psychiatric complaints, cardiac and blood pressure problems, or weakness -- they were able to evaluate and treat 78 percent of patients at home. ""Often, even our sickest patients don't want to go to the hospital,"" said Dr. Abrashkin, the lead author of the study. On each call, the paramedics, acting as physician extenders, consulted with doctors by phone or a secure video link. They performed physical exams and ran electrocardiograms. They treated breathing problems with nebulizers, administered diuretics and oxygen for heart failure symptoms, and provided IV fluids for dehydration. Of those patients who were taken to emergency rooms, however, more than 80 percent were admitted. ""The teams were able to identify those patients sick enough to really need and want to go to the hospital,"" Dr. Abrashkin said. Since she became a community paramedics patient, Maria Vitale's one ambulance ride followed a fall in May 2015. X-rays taken in her home showed she had a broken hip. Otherwise the paramedics have been able to care for her without dashing to the hospital. Last month, for instance, her knee buckled as she was heading for the kitchen, using her walker. She went down, and the aide walking with her wasn't strong enough to lift her off the floor. Charles Borger, a paramedic for more than 20 years but a recent addition to the community paramedicine program, responded to the call.

Travel,Airlines Say Everybody Onboard Must Wear a Mask. So Why Aren't They?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/travel/coronavirus-flying-face-masks.html,"As airlines try to convince Americans to fly again, they have touted their policies for keeping passengers safe, including the requirement that everyone onboard a plane wear a mask. But travelers on recent flights said the rules are not being enforced. And flight attendants said they have been told not to confront passengers who opt to not follow them. Drusilla Lawton flew from South Carolina to Wyoming in May on two American Airlines flights and said the mask rule wasn't being enforced during boarding or on the plane. ""I was just horrified watching the gate agent let people through without their masks,"" said Ms. Lawton, a part-time portfolio manager. ""When I was walking down the aisle I was wondering, 'How many people aren't wearing a mask?' There were so many."" Ms. Lawton said the first leg of the trip was ""particularly bad"" and the people across the aisle from her, those in front of her and those behind her did not wear masks. Although the woman sitting next to her put on a mask after Ms. Lawton asked her to, there was never an announcement from the flight crew or captain about the rules.

On social media and in emails to The Times, other travelers described similar scenarios, which left them feeling they had to choose between confronting fellow passengers and possibly encountering hostility, and sitting on a flight for hours potentially being exposed to the coronavirus. The patchwork enforcement of policies has left passengers uncomfortable, confused about whether they should be wearing masks or not, and concerned about their safety. They've also left flight attendants with the difficult task of trying to make people do something they won't be punished for if they choose not to comply. ""Airlines have said follow the guidelines, but don't enforce them, don't tackle people to the ground and don't turn flights around if they don't listen,"" said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants union. ""That gets around to the public then it's, 'I don't have to do this. There are no consequences if I don't do this.' That, too, can lead to conflict, not just with the flight attendants, but with other passengers, who get angry and all of a sudden we have to break up a fight."" Recent passengers on Delta Air Lines have posted on Twitter about fliers failing to wear masks (""What's the point in requiring if there is no follow through?"" one man asked the airline in a tweet). Another Delta passenger wrote on Twitter that he asked a flight attendant about the mask rule after seeing a passenger, a flight attendant and the pilot without masks on. He was told that the rules couldn't be enforced. And after one doctor's Twitter post about the lack of social distancing on a United Airlines flight went viral, another United traveler said she'd had to ask a gate agent to put on a mask before getting on a full flight to Chicago from New Jersey.

""If you're traveling right now, be prepared to advocate for yourself,"" she wrote, adding that, ""United did not follow their own social distancing guidelines,"" and many travelers were not wearing masks. Nicole Carriere, a spokeswoman for United, said that face coverings are mandatory for all employees and passengers onboard and the airline is providing free masks to customers who need them. In instances where people refuse to wear a mask, they can be pulled aside ""to further understand their concerns and discuss options,"" Ms. Carriere said. ""This would include things like moving them to a new seat where they could maintain a safe social distance from other passengers."" Denying someone boarding would be a ""last resort,"" she said.

Aims Coney, 65, recently flew from Missoula, Mont., to Boston with his wife. When the boarding group for their second flight, on American, was called, people gathered close together, causing him some anxiety about the lack of social distancing, Mr. Coney, who is known as Andy, said in a phone interview. ""The crew made no effort to ask passengers to wear their masks properly and even joked about the rule with an obnoxious guy across from us with his mask under his chin who seemed to be enjoying making everyone else uncomfortable,"" he said. Mr. Coney, said that he and his wife were also particularly concerned about people traveling without masks because the two of them are in the ""over-65 vulnerable group"" and had been deferring their return home to Massachusetts since mid-March. They only decided to fly home after American announced its social-distancing rules and safety measures. Typically, when an event as major as the coronavirus is involved, government agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Labor and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, have come together with airlines, unions and other stakeholders to create policies and emergency procedures to help travelers and transportation staff, said Ms. Nelson of the flight attendants union.

But since the coronavirus pandemic began, no such coordination has taken place. That has left the airlines to set their own rules -- and their own standards of enforcement. ""In normal times something like this calls for a federal response, but we don't have it,"" Ms. Nelson said. ""In an event like 9/11 things were incredibly transparent. There were emergency procedures put into place. None of that is happening now. We don't have consistent rules, so the airlines are trying to figure out how to navigate this."" Last month, Reuters reported that the three airlines instructed their employees not to enforce the rules that had been promoted to travelers. ""Once on board and off the gate, the face covering policy becomes more lenient,"" American said to its staff in an email that was quoted in the Reuters report. ""The flight attendant's role is informational, not enforcement, with respect to the face covering policy."" Ms. Nelson said that one concern for flight attendants has been about what happens if there's a confrontation with a passenger who is asked to wear a mask, but doesn't want to. ""All of this is so fuzzy because the airlines have made this edict and they can't enforce it,"" said Benet Wilson, an aviation expert at The Points Guy, a travel site aimed at frequent fliers. ""Airlines can say people should follow these rules all they want, but in the end, if they tell a person they can't come on they have to refund them and they don't want to do that."" The airlines, Ms. Nelson said, are creating policies quickly, in a changing environment and without unifying guidance, so rules can be confusing for people flying with multiple airlines.

""It's likely that a traveler who read about how this will work could get to the airport and things are very different by the time they get there,"" she said. The airlines have also said they will leave middle seats open when possible to encourage social distancing and change boarding procedures in order to avoid having big groups congregate at the gate or on the jetway. But passengers have complained that these guidelines are also not always being followed. Lisa Hanna, a spokeswoman for Delta, said that the airline is requiring people to wear masks ""beginning in the check-in lobby, and across Delta touchpoints, including Delta Sky Clubs, in jet bridges and onboard for the duration of the flight -- except during the food and beverage service. A face mask is required to begin the boarding process, and also strongly encouraged in high-traffic areas including security lines and restrooms."" Ross Feinstein, a spokesman for American, said that ""American, like other U.S. airlines, requires customers to wear a face covering while on board, and this requirement is enforced at the gate while boarding. We also remind customers with announcements both during boarding and at departure."" But Tony Scott said that wasn't the case. Mr. Scott, a 53-year-old marketing executive who lives in Los Angeles, booked a first class ticket on the airline, expecting that with social-distancing policies he would have adequate space. But the passenger next to him, a teenage girl, refused to wear one. When he talked to the flight attendant, he was told that masks were optional, even though the American app said otherwise. The flight attendant later told Mr. Scott that masks were mandatory, but not for children. ""This was a 16-17 year old Caucasian girl,"" Mr. Scott wrote on Twitter. ""I explained that I'm in the HIGH RISK category as an African-American male with asthma and other health issues. No other accommodation was offered.""

Style,Serena Williams Has a Genius Eyebrow Hack,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/style/serena-williams-beauty-routine.html,"The tennis great Serena Williams recently had a baby (a girl named Olympia), took up running and is putting in hours of training time to get fully back on the pro tennis circuit. In short, she has a lot on her plate. But Ms. Williams, 36, who travels between Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., and San Francisco, also carves out time for her beauty regimen, which is a mix of natural-leaning products and ones chosen to produce results. See what she's using, below. I'm a big-time beauty fan -- definitely, all my life. I remember when I was younger, I had so much that I had whole cabinets just stuffed with beauty. But I'm incredibly organized. I'm a Type A personality. In the morning, it depends on how I'm feeling. I might use a face wash -- it's a gel wash called Dual Action AHA Cleanser & Mask from the European MZ Skin Luxury Skin line. It's my secret, and it's amazing. I also use the MZ face cream. The packaging is pink with a gold cap -- it's so pretty. I think packaging matters. I was in Harrods when I saw the line. I tried the cream first and fell in love. I'm getting better at doing face masks, too. I got some that are gold, also from MZ Skin. I think the masks work, but I don't use them enough.

Or maybe instead of cleanser, I'll use a big jar of organic, unrefined coconut oil. I use that as a wash, wipe it off with hot water, and then I'm done. I don't do anything after that except for SPF. I don't walk out of the house without SPF on, and neither does Olympia. For me, I use Neutrogena. That seems to be what every dermatologist recommends. For her, she uses natural shea butter, which is a natural SPF. That's what some doctors told me, and I read up on it. For babies, you don't want to give them the toxins. The truth is, we don't really need it either. I use of lot of natural things. I make oils myself -- I just mix things -- which is a new phase I'm on. I usually mix a jojoba oil and a coconut oil, and I might put that on my face. I add an essential oil if it's for my hair or body. I generally don't use an essential oil for my face. Other than that, I like things that really work. That's the one thing underlining my career too: results. I like the results from the Vine Vera line. I have the vitamin C serum, the Resveratrol peel and the Resveratrol serum. At night I make sure to take off my makeup with coconut oil, rinse my face with warm water and a towel, and then apply these products. Also, I saw results with Embrace Scar Therapy. I had a C-section with Olympia, and I actually ended up getting cut twice. It was because I had a hematoma, and they had to go back in my wound and recut the route. I was like, ""Oh my God, I'm going to have the worst scar,"" which is crazy that was on my mind, but that's natural. That's what women think. It's our bodies. It's invasive to scar up our bodies.

But my friend knew about this dressing called Embrace, and it treats the scar. This was before I became an ambassador for them. I was skeptical. I think a lot of women are. But when I put it on, I could literally feel the tension releasing from the scar. I never wear much makeup. But lately I've been wearing a little more. A good friend of mine told me, ""A little goes a long way,"" so I've been putting in a little time. In less than five minutes, I have a full face. I do a little concealer. If I want it to last all day, I use Kat Von D. If I'm going for a lighter look, I use the Nars Radiant Creamy. Then I use a little powder to set it. I use a lot of MAC powder because they have really good powder for my skin color. But if I'm just setting, then I use a translucent one. Then it's L'Oreal Voluminous mascara -- always the waterproof. My brows, I sometimes just let them go, but I also have the Anastasia brow pencil, which is the best. But the other day, I didn't have my brow pencil with me, and I just used my mascara on my brows. If it gets too dark, I'll put a little concealer on there. If I'm on the court, then I'll go au naturel, but I do wear waterproof eyeliner sometimes, and that's it. I just found one that works for me called Skylar. I'm an investor in a lot of companies, and this company reached out to someone on my team. I love natural scents because I have been allergic to perfume and haven't worn it for years. I absolutely loved these, so now I'm an investor in the brand as well.

I love to make my hair oils. And I always use a co-wash, and I always use very natural stuff for African-American hair. Right now, I have tons of curls, and Miss Jessie's is great. I also use the As I Am line all the time -- love it. Dye: Right now I usually do the tips or try to make something fun out of it. I do like my natural color, but I like to play. I have a lady in Miami, Angie, who's been doing my hair for 10 years. I love hot stone massages. In Florida, it's also really popular to do foot massages. You sit down, and they just do your feet. It's so great. I have to worry about diet and fitness all the time. It's my job to be fit. I have to have a good diet. I have to work out. Now, since the baby and only since the baby, I try to do cardio three or four times a week where I just go on a run. I actually never ran before, but I wanted to drop weight fast. It worked for me. Because I wanted to lean out, I also wanted to eat a lot healthier so I went vegan for 44 days. That worked out really well. Then I tried it again. But now, I'm vega-tarian. I'm going to Europe soon. I love cheese, but I only like the cheese in Europe. So I call myself a vega-tarian so I can have that amazing cheese.",The tennis star leans toward natural products and — no surprise — expects to see results.,b62bf2cc-46a8-5b83-adb3-bb07562e035e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/17/fashion/17SKIN-Serena/merlin_137353530_f0a9fb98-7df3-413d-a49d-2b239f5cbe54-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=8b132b02c390104d044225b65d78e0e613204e7bbe045c5a5a59941b12567b85&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Serena Williams.,b62bf2cc-46a8-5b83-adb3-bb07562e035e,N24News/imgs/b62bf2cc-46a8-5b83-adb3-bb07562e035e.jpg,15

DANCE AMONG FRIENDS at the Museum of Modern Art Sculpture Garden (Sept. 6, 11:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.). The visual artist Robert Rauschenberg, who died in 2008, was as much a force in midcentury American dance as some of the era's pioneering choreographers. His sets, costumes, lighting and sound designs influenced and enhanced the radical ideas of a number of future dance luminaries, among them Merce Cunningham, Trisha Brown and Paul Taylor. And their avant-garde work informed his nontraditional artistic practice as well. In recognition of this two-way exchange, MoMA will present a sampling of collaborations created over nearly 40 years, including Mr. Cunningham's ""Changeling,"" Mr. Taylor's ""Tracer"" and Ms. Brown's ""You Can See Us.""

Dance,Review: 'For Claude Shannon' Visualizes the Links Between Text and Movement,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/22/arts/dance/review-for-claude-shannon-visualizes-the-links-between-text-and-movement.html,"When you walk into the Kitchen to watch ""For Claude Shannon,"" the work's four dancers are already onstage, warming up. In addition to the usual limbering, though, they appear to be thinking especially hard, going over something in their heads. According to the program note, that's exactly what they're doing: preparing to perform a long and complicated dance they've only just learned.

""For Claude Shannon"" is named after the mathematical engineer who connected symbolic logic with electronic circuits. Liz Santoro and Pierre Godard have devised a lexicon of 24 movements for arms and legs. Before each performance, a sequence (""one of nearly 30 billion possible sequences"") is generated using the syntactic structure of a sentence by Shannon. The performers, who include Ms. Santoro, have two hours to learn it.

The dance, which had its premiere on Thursday as part of the Kitchen's ""From Minimalism Into Algorithm"" series, looks like the output of a fairly simple computer program. In a mechanically even rhythm, arms are raised and lowered semaphorically, feet are extended and retracted, but elbows and knees are rarely bent. Because of the reliance on a small, set vocabulary, the dancers' orientation -- which direction each is facing, in relation to the others -- assumes greater importance. The work is not about the steps. The dancers go in and out of unison, revealing a logic. Sometimes they stop, but the sequence continues.

At first, all this occurs in silence. But Greg Beller's electronic score introduces an airplane hum and static and then random clicks that resolve into a metronomic beat; the beat slowly accelerates, acquires rumbling bass and eventually compounds into a polyrhythmic dance track.","Liz Santoro and Pierre Godard's dance, part of the Kitchen's ""From Minimalism Into Algorithm"" series, looks like the output of a computer program .",d4e8f8b7-69d5-5b06-81df-739bffa2761a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/22/arts/22CLAUDE/22CLAUDE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=fba7dc59edad8710e145bf40c7b1a6bd6a7f44f5e1af28736efdbadfd69ef75a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Liz Santoro, Marco D'Agostin, Cynthia Koppe and Teresa Silva in ""For Claude Shannon,"" at the Kitchen.",d4e8f8b7-69d5-5b06-81df-739bffa2761a,N24News/imgs/d4e8f8b7-69d5-5b06-81df-739bffa2761a.jpg,6
Books,Want to Read Michael Lewis's Next Work? You'll Be Able to Listen to It First,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/02/books/audible-michael-lewis-audiobooks.html,"Want to Read Michael Lewis's Next Work? You'll Be Able to Listen to It First

When Michael Lewis had an idea for his next book, a contemporary political narrative, he decided he would test it out first as a 10,000-word magazine article, as he often does before committing to a yearslong project. But this time he made a surprising pivot. Instead of publishing the story in Vanity Fair, where he has been a contributing writer for nearly a decade, he sold it to Audible, the audiobook publisher and retailer. ""You're not going to be able to read it, you're only going to be able to listen to it,"" Mr. Lewis said. ""I've become Audible's first magazine writer.""

Mr. Lewis is part of a growing group of A-list authors bypassing print and releasing audiobook originals, hoping to take advantage of the exploding audiobook market. It's the latest sign that audiobooks are no longer an appendage of print, but a creative medium in their own right. But the rise of stand-alone audio has also made some traditional publishers nervous, as Audible strikes deals directly with writers, including best-selling authors like the historian Robert Caro and the novelist Jeffery Deaver. After years of stagnation in the industry, audiobooks have become a rare bright spot for publishers. While e-book sales have fallen and print has remained anemic, publishers' revenue for downloaded audio has nearly tripled in the last five years, industry data from the Association of American Publishers shows. This has set off a new turf war over audio rights, pitting Audible, owned by Amazon, against traditional publishers, who are increasingly insisting on producing their own audiobooks, wary of ceding more territory and revenue to the online retailer. The battle over who will dominate the industry's fastest growing format is reshaping the publishing landscape, much as e-books did a decade ago, driving up advances for audio rights and leading some authors to sign straight-to-audio deals. ""Nobody cares about the empty land until they discover oil on it,"" said the literary agent Russell Galen, who represents best-selling authors like Cassandra Clare and Diana Gabaldon. ""All of the sudden, print publishers are fighting over audio."" Audible, the biggest player with more than 425,000 titles in its online store, has an enormous advantage in this increasingly crowded arena. Amazon has been pushing audiobooks on its platform, listing them as ""free"" with a trial Audible membership, which costs $15 a month, and includes a book each month. (The typical price of la carte audiobooks ranges from around $15 to $40 depending on the length.) The company is increasingly looking for new ways not just to sell audiobooks, but to create them independently from publishers, driving their profit margins even higher.

""Amazon's position in the digital audio market is even more dominant and unshakable than its position was in the e-book market,"" said Michael Cader, a book industry analyst and the founder of Publishers Marketplace. ""They're virtually unchallenged."" Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

Audible executives say they are investing in original works in part to meet growing consumer demand, and also to generate stories that are designed to be listened to rather than read. In the last two years, the company has released 77 original audio works, and it has nearly 150 more in various stages of production. As part of its push for original stories, Audible is commissioning one- and two-person plays, and recently awarded grants to 15 emerging playwrights. In May, it announced a deal with the actress and producer Reese Witherspoon to develop audio originals.

Mr. Scalzi said he decided to write an audio original in part because he's seen audiobook sales of his books mushroom, overtaking his digital and hardcover sales. He pointed to his 2014 novel, ""Lock In,"" which he said sold 22,500 hardcovers, 24,000 e-books and 41,000 audiobooks. ""You have to go where the market is, and you can't just give them the same old thing,"" he said. Mel Robbins made a similar calculation after her self-help book, ""The 5 Second Rule,"" sold hundreds of thousands of copies in audio, four times what it sold in print. In May, she released her latest book as an audio original. For decades, the audiobook market was limited by physical constraints: Listeners had to lug around cassette tapes or CDs, and bookstores devoted fewer and fewer shelves to the format. Digital technology upended that. Cellphones now function as audiobook players. People who felt they had little time to read are now listening while they commute, exercise or do chores. Consumers bought nearly 90 million audiobooks in 2016, up from 42 million in 2012, driving audiobook sales up to $2.1 billion, according to the Audio Publishers Association. Publishers have jump-started production of titles in what was once a sleepy and overlooked format, investing in elaborate, multi-cast productions and building new recording studios.

In the last five years, Hachette has doubled the number of audiobooks it produces; it will release around 700 titles this year. Penguin Random House will put out roughly 1,200 audio titles, up from 652 in 2014, and now has 15 recording studios. Macmillan Audio will release 470 audiobooks this year, a 46 percent increase over 2017. Two of the company's biggest recent hits are the audiobooks for James Comey's ""A Higher Loyalty,"" which has sold more than 167,000 copies, and Michael Wolff's ""Fire and Fury,"" which sold about 320,000. With publishers holding on to more of their audiobook rights, Audible has started approaching agents and authors directly to buy audio rights before book proposals even get submitted to publishers.

The company has also teamed up with smaller publishing houses to go after big books in competitive auctions, paying a substantial amount for audio rights. Last year, Audible partnered with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, which doesn't have an audio division, to buy ""Wild Game,"" a memoir by Adrienne Brodeur, which reportedly sold for seven figures after a competitive auction involving 14 publishers. Audible and Houghton Mifflin also jointly acquired a forthcoming memoir by the Olympic snowboarder Shaun White, which will be released in audio a month before the print edition is published this November. Ellen Archer, president of HMH Trade Publishing, said she expects the audio release will boost print sales, rather than cannibalizing them. ""The marketing muscle they're going to put behind this book is going to drive interest in the print version,"" she said. Last fall, in a highly unusual deal, Audible prevailed in an auction against several major publishing houses for rights to a new nonfiction book by Ada Calhoun, author of ""St. Marks Is Dead."" The book, about how Generation X women are struggling with middle age, grew out of an Oprah online article Ms. Calhoun wrote that went viral and prompted offers from multiple publishers. Audible outbid them all, with a high six-figure advance for audio, print and digital rights, according to two publishing executives with knowledge of the deal. Ms. Calhoun was surprised to find herself swayed by Audible's pitch. ""I come out of print publishing, so I thought, you do the print book and then you do the audiobook, but then I got excited about the possibility of doing it as a different form,"" she said.

Sports,Eli Manning Always Chose New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/sports/football/eli-manning-retiring-giants.html,"Huddled in the stands during the waning moments of the Giants' regular season finale last month, as the last seconds ticked off in yet another disastrous Giants season -- the team's sixth losing campaign in seven years -- Giants fans sought succor in a memory. On the sideline, where he uncomfortably paced as a backup, Eli Manning turned his eyes to the stands, smiled faintly and raised a hand in tribute, a scene that symbolized the mix of pride and melancholy accompanying the end of Manning's career, a retirement which will be made official Friday. During 16 seasons as an N.F.L. quarterback, the most visible and pressure-packed position in American sports, Manning, a scion of football royalty, had a historic career reviving the storied N.F.L. franchise with two Super Bowl upset victories over the imperial New England Patriots. Manning, 39, entered the league in 2004 shrouded by the shadow of his accomplished older brother Peyton, who was considered the modern era's quintessential N.F.L. quarterback.

Like an archetypical little brother, though, Eli carved a different path. While Peyton was hyper-efficient on the field and won two Super Bowls of his own, Eli was known for goofy expressions and graceless missteps but also for his steely-eyed resolve in the game's most tense moments. The younger Manning not only set dozens of records, he had a superior postseason record than his brother, never lost a Super Bowl or conference championship game (Peyton lost two Super Bowls and one conference championship game) and was celebrated for his poise on football's biggest stages.

As the winner of the Most Valuable Player Award in the Super Bowls following the 2007 and 2011 seasons, the soft-spoken, normally inconspicuous Manning instantly became a national personality -- in part because celebrity was in such contrast to his aw-shucks demeanor. Soon, Manning was dancing and singing in prominent television commercials with his telegenic brother and hosting ""Saturday Night Live,"" where he mocked his own gawkiness.

But beginning in 2013, the Giants and Manning began a long decline. Manning's record as a starter in his final seven seasons was 39-60, with the Giants qualifying for the playoffs only once in that span. Manning, typically reliable, threw a career-high (and league-leading) 27 interceptions in 2013, and fumbled 53 times from that year on. At MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, where the Giants play home games and where Manning had long been feted by raucous crowds, he was booed with increasing frequency. Manning's relationship with fans, both nationwide and in the New York area, was complicated. When he was briefly benched in 2017, the reaction across the country could have been summed up in four words: What took so long?

Giants fans, however, took Manning's demotion as a personal insult to the legacy of their glory years. Their outcry was so vociferous that Manning was restored as the starter and the team's coach, Ben McAdoo, and general manager, Jerry Reese, were fired. Manning may have been born in New Orleans and educated at the University of Mississippi, but New Yorkers claimed him as one of their own.

Daniel Jones, from Duke University, was drafted in the first round and took over for Manning after just two games, both lopsided Giants losses. ""It happens to everyone,"" Manning, in the last year of his Giants contract, said. ""No one gets to play forever."" As the season played out, there was speculation that Manning might choose to sign a free-agent contract with another team next season. Those closest to Manning knew that was unlikely. Years earlier, Archie Manning, an all-American quarterback at Mississippi, had said of his youngest son: ""The thing you have to understand is that Eli really loves being the Giants quarterback. It's how he sees himself."" The day after 2019 season ended, Manning said he would take time to weigh his future. But in the last month, he settled into a different routine, one that included coaching at some of his four children's youth sports events. Manning, who is active in multiple charities, grew more comfortable with life as a father, husband and volunteer in suburban northern New Jersey. The grind of 12-hour days studying film, memorizing game plans, practicing on weekdays and playing a violent game on Sundays started to feel less appealing.",Manning's 16-season N.F.L. career began with him orchestrating a draft-day trade to the Giants and ended with him choosing to retire rather than play elsewhere.,79d808f1-9c73-5546-9a07-b955efb32a07,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/24/multimedia/24NFL-GIANTS-1/24NFL-GIANTS-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=4802632ae4c8215ea1a2dba8488485a35df54567b445fff09d693d5c4f4dc880&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Eli Manning's father, Archie, once said of his son, ""The thing you have to understand is that Eli really loves being the Giants quarterback.

Opinion,No More Money for the Police,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/opinion/george-floyd-police-funding.html,"George Floyd was still murdered. The focus on training, diversity and technology like body cameras shifts focus away from the root cause of police violence and instead gives the police more power and resources. The problem is that the entire criminal justice system gives police officers the power and opportunity to systematically harass and kill with impunity.

The solution to ending police violence and cultivating a safer country lies in reducing the power of the police and their contact with the public. We can do that by reinvesting the $100 billion spent on policing nationwide in alternative emergency response programs, as protesters in Minneapolis have called for. City, state and federal grants can also fund these programs.

Municipalities can begin by changing policies or statutes so police officers never respond to certain kinds of emergencies, including ones that involve substance abuse, domestic violence, homelessness or mental health. Instead, health care workers or emergency response teams would handle these incidents. So if someone calls 911 to report a drug overdose, health care teams rush to the scene; the police wouldn't get involved. If a person calls 911 to complain about people who are homeless, rapid response social workers would provide them with housing support and other resources. Conflict interrupters and restorative justice teams could mediate situations where no one's safety is being threatened. Community organizers, rather than police officers, would help manage responses to the pandemic. Ideally, people would have the option to call a different number -- say 727 -- to access various trained response teams.

The good news is, this is already happening. Violence interruption programs exist throughout the country and they're often led by people from the community who have experience navigating tricky situations. Some programs, like one in Washington, D.C., do not work with the police; its staff members rely instead on personal outreach and social connections for information about violence that they work to mediate and diffuse. We should invest in these programs, which operate on shoestring budgets, so they have their own dedicated dispatch centers outside of 911.

Dallas is pioneering a new approach where social workers are being dispatched to some 911 calls that involve mental health emergencies. The program has shown success, and many of the people receive care that they would never have gotten in jails or overcrowded hospitals.",Redirect it to emergency response programs that don't kill black people.,353304a7-814c-5fcf-b10c-69ed7b5a5b6e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/30/opinion/30McHarris/30McHarris-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=0f042a2b9a082035c37099e33f38a62f01b593bf2092948b8637f4f1a296dc3f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Municipalities could change policies so social service workers, not the police, are dispatched for certain kinds of 911 calls.",353304a7-814c-5fcf-b10c-69ed7b5a5b6e,N24News/imgs/353304a7-814c-5fcf-b10c-69ed7b5a5b6e.jpg,11

Leonard Cohen left behind unfinished songs when he died in 2016, and his son and producer, Adam Cohen, has completed them for an album, ""Thanks for the Dance,"" which will be released Nov. 22. A version of ""Happens to the Heart"" was published in the 2018 book ""The Flame,"" but Cohen was still improving it when he recorded this performance. The music is gorgeously realized; Cohen intones his lyrics with clear implications of melody, and the track fleshes them out with an orchestra, an acoustic guitar hinting at flamenco and a melancholy piano line. ""Happens to the Heart"" sounds like vintage Cohen: somber and sly, invoking the spiritual alongside the mundane, making paradoxes profound. Now the angel's got a fiddle

The devil's got a harp

Every soul is like a minnow

Every mind is like a shark

Me, I've broken every window

But the house, the house is dark

I care, but very little

What happens to the heart.

The Argentine songwriter and singer Juana Molina has built a catalog of subtle, insinuating, crafty songs, but her coming EP, ""Forfun,"" cranks up the guitars for punk impact. ""Paraguaya Punk"" is a remake of her song ""Paraguaya,"" a tale of witchcraft and erotic spell-casting that leaves her bored with her conquest. It's still in 6/4 rather than punk's usual 4/4, but for two propulsive minutes she wrestles with how supernatural powers can go wrong; the chorus is ""no no no no no no no no no."" PARELES The Soul Rebels featuring Robert Glasper, Tarriona Ball and Fabriq, 'Blush (Poetry in Motion)'

Throughout their new album, ""Poetry in Motion,"" the Soul Rebels demonstrate in a whole host of ways that sounding like New Orleans doesn't have to mean sounding like the past. Then on the last song, the quasi-title-track ""Blush (Poetry in Motion),"" they hand the creative reins over almost entirely to Robert Glasper, guesting on keyboards. The brass band becomes an ace backing ensemble -- as it has for Nas and Curren$y -- filling out Glasper's flowy post-Dilla hip-hop sound. Eventually the Rebels' hometown pal Tarriona Ball (of Tank and the Bangas) comes in with a verse of bubbly, besmitten rap, sounding like Noname's New Orleans cousin. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

Chris Martin and Co.'s last smash was the 2017 track ""Something Just Like This,"" a souped-up synth-heavy collaboration with the Chainsmokers that Tina Turner loves (even if she refuses to acknowledge the Chainsmokers' contribution). Cue the strumming: Two songs previewing the band's Nov. 22 album, ""Everyday Life,"" revisit the charge of building tension and release via acoustic instruments. Femi Kuti and his band provide horn riffs and skronks on ""Arabesque,"" and a chorus of young voices and a bouncy bass line carry the nostalgic yet jubilant ""Orphans"" to what's becoming an increasingly bittersweet promise: ""I want to be with you till the whole world ends.""

For the last couple of years, Bad Bunny has worked seamlessly across genres -- reggaeton and Latin trap, collaborations with pop stars and rappers -- eager to demonstrate that he's never not at home. Now, he's extended his reach into Mexican music, forming a bridge between regional styles and approaches that rarely meet. He appears on a remix of ""Soy El Diablo"" by the teen singer Natanael Cano, part of an emergent movement of performers attempting to modernize Mexican corridos. To fit in, Bad Bunny draws his singing out into broad, theatrical smears, a rollicking performance for a rollicking genre. CARAMANICA Orrin Evans has a long personal history with Reid Anderson, the Bad Plus's bassist, but it is his rapport with the drummer Dave King -- and King's hyper, trouncing style -- that gives the new iteration of this trio its activation energy. All told, there's a fresh ease and joy to the Bad Plus's sound now that Evans has settled into the piano chair, which was held for over 15 years by Ethan Iverson. It is clear that Evans has been studying the group's past repertoire, as he plays a role not altogether different from Iverson's: He's sentimental but with restraint, and rarely fills out his chords with a lot of jazz dissonance. But there's plenty of difference between them. With Evans, the band's humor is no longer hitched to a Wagnerian, Britteneque severity. (Iverson is a pianist of many gifts, it should be noted, and he made some watershed albums with the Bad Plus, particularly in the early 2000s. He continues to do interesting work on his own, as a pianist and composer venturing between jazz and classical.) ""Dovetail Nicely,"" a King composition, sits near the center of the group's new LP, ""Activate Infinity,"" its second studio album with Evans and its 14th overall. If the album's title is a deprecatingly self-aggrandizing reference to the trio's own stubborn persistence, then bring it on. They ought to stick around as long as they like.

Music,"Live From New York, It's Jazz at a Distance",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/arts/music/jazz-smalls-coronavirus-concerts.html,"Spike Wilner, left, the owner of Smalls, and Carlos Abadie, its general manager, preparing the club for the return of live bands on its stage.





In a different age, about three months ago, 20 bucks could buy you up to four sets of music at Smalls, the pulsing Greenwich Village basement club celebrated for crowd-pleasing, unfussy jazz. Squeeze into the front row and you'd be close enough to the musicians to sweat on one other. Buy a drink and you were welcome to stick around for a 1 a.m. jam session featuring brash up-and-comers -- and maybe guest turns by established stars. That cover charge, and a willingness to pack yourself in, also bought access to the intimate Mezzrow, Smalls's sister club, just across Seventh Avenue South. Smalls and Mezzrow haven't been packed in the last 12 weeks, of course. The clubs shuttered after performances on March 15, and their owner, Spike Wilner, said that even before the mandated shutdown, the crowds had diminished and musicians had been canceling gigs. But there's a funny thing about jazz: It keeps roaring back to life. Live music returns to Smalls on June 1, in a socially distant way, thanks to Mr. Wilner's persistence, the club's shift into full nonprofit mode and a windfall from a celebrity benefactor -- a $25,000 donation to the SmallsLIVE Foundation from Billy Joel. ""That gift was such a positive vibe at a time when things were really dark,"" Mr. Wilner said last week. ""The impact of the virus has been devastating on the jazz community.""

Mr. Wilner's plan for the money addresses the greatest hardship that jazz players are facing during the shutdown: lost gigs. He has booked a different jazz band at Smalls for two sets a night, at 7 and 8:30 p.m., all through June, paying the usual gig rate. It's not quite a reopening, though. The musicians will be alone in the club except for an engineer and a manager. The audience will be at home, watching via the livestream that has regularly broadcast Smalls shows. Smalls makes its sets available in real time, then archives them behind a paywall for donors who have given at least $10 to the SmallsLIVE Foundation. The livestreams will also be available on the club's Facebook page.

No other major New York City jazz club is getting back to live, on-site performances so early. The trumpeter and composer Jeremy Pelt, who plays Smalls on reopening night in the drummer Joe Farnsworth's quartet, has no qualms about being cautious while performing. ""We're armed with the basic knowledge of how the virus spreads. When I go down to Smalls, I'm not going to be hugging people and slapping high fives, even with my very dear friends. We're going to make this music and leave.""

The organist and composer Akiko Tsuruga noted that the Smalls stage is large enough for the players to connect while still staying six feet apart. She said that when her quartet plays there on June 12 she'll miss the club's community -- the crowds of aficionados and out-of-towners, the musicians who pop in to hang -- but will simply be happy for the chance to play. ""The lockdown has reminded me how important playing music is to my life,"" Ms. Tsuruga said. The money matters, too, of course. Jazz musicians rely more than ever on live performances to pay their bills, especially as streaming has gutted revenues from recordings. Ms. Tsuruga has lost gigs with the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra and the all-female collective Lioness, and Mr. Pelt had to cut short a European tour. ""This hit everybody right where it hurts, right in the pocket,"" Mr. Pelt said. ""That's not even mentioning the mental effect of not playing with your colleagues."" Some help has come from the Louis Armstrong Educational Foundation, whose current president is Wynton Marsalis. The organization has allocated a million dollars for grants of $1,000 to the region's working jazz musicians to be dispensed through an emergency fund. Other clubs have booked players for Zoom gigs, like the Jazz Gallery's Lockdown Sessions, in which musicians like Joel Ross or Camila Meza chat over Zoom with Rio Sakairi, the Gallery's artistic director, and then present new, homemade videos of themselves playing solo or with a live-in partner. Some festivals, too, have moved online, such as the annual celebration for artists on the pianist Fabian Almazan's Biophilia Records.

But jazz players insist that a Zoom connection doesn't cut it when it comes to collaborative improvisation. ""That connection can't happen over a computer,"" the pianist and singer Johnny O'Neal said. Ms. Tsuruga agreed: ""Musicians need eye contact and the same vibe."" Mr. Pelt titled his most recent album ""The Art of Intimacy, Vol. 1,"" which refers not just to the romantic yearning of the set's luminous ballads. ""It's not necessarily about the love aspect. It's the fact that listening to this music is like listening in on a private conversation between the musicians.""

Conversations like that, Mr. Pelt believes, demand physical presence. ""We're almost able to play and interact digitally, with no blips and not being a nanosecond off. But what will never be replaced is the human interaction with your fellow musicians."" Mr. Joel agrees. ""There's something about the atmosphere or the acoustics of playing together live in a small place that you can't replicate any other way,"" he said. ""It's an immediate sensation, feeling the vibrations of the drum and the resonance of a standup bass."" Like the jazz players, Mr. Joel has also tired of canceled gigs, including a summer tour and his Madison Square Garden residency. The singer and pianist said that he's fortunate enough to be able to pay his band and crew full salary during the shutdown, but he misses ""the community aspect"" of playing live -- connecting with other musicians.","The Greenwich Village club Smalls is booking bands inside the venue again, but audiences will still have to stay home.",4839c09c-2817-5af6-98c1-b4f1df5be763,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/02/arts/31smalls1/31smalls1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=2b593704d16190b00be90b995d850803032f0f40c1a4d4205f509a59e69507f5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"&ldquo;The impact of the virus has been devastating on the jazz community,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilner.",4839c09c-2817-5af6-98c1-b4f1df5be763,N24News/imgs/4839c09c-2817-5af6-98c1-b4f1df5be763.jpg,12
Travel,"For Cruise Visitors, an On-Shore Taste of Alaska's Bounty",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/travel/for-cruise-visitors-an-on-shore-taste-of-alaskas-bounty.html,"Nearly one million cruise passengers annually visit Juneau, Alaska's rugged state capital, from May through September, often swarming the town of nearly 33,000 residents on day trips and shore excursions. Its main attractions include the nearby Mendenhall Glacier, where the visitors' center offers boardwalk trails that overlook bear-viewing areas, and small boat trips to watch orca and humpback whales.

If, post-tour, most of those visitors ate their meals back on their ships, they could hardly be blamed for shunning popcorn and fudge. Until recently, Juneau didn't have much to offer the discerning diner. But what a local chef, Tracy LaBarge, started nine years ago with a small shack behind the public library devoted to king crab has snowballed with new restaurant openings, a weekly food truck event and fresh enthusiasm for locally sourced fare.

Movies,"If You Want to Learn About the L.A. Rebellion Filmmakers, Start Here",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/movies/la-rebellion-charles-burnett.html,"In the essay film ""Los Angeles Plays Itself,"" the filmmaker and academic Thom Andersen argues that as much as Hollywood loves to photograph Los Angeles, mainstream movies have erased the history and texture of the city. As an antidote, he favors lower-budget productions, reserving special affection for a group of independent directors who attended film school at the University of California, Los Angeles, and became collectively known as the L.A. Rebellion. As U.C.L.A.'s own book on the movement explains, these directors -- who included Charles Burnett, Billy Woodberry, Julie Dash and Haile Gerima -- ""created a watershed body of work that strives to perform the revolutionary act of humanizing Black people on screen."" While the book cautions against grouping the filmmakers together -- each has a distinct perspective, and they don't all subscribe to the L.A. Rebellion label, which wasn't their idea -- they did work on one another's movies in the 1970s and early '80s. The links between Burnett's ""Killer of Sheep"" (1978) and Woodberry's ""Bless Their Little Hearts"" (1984), which Burnett wrote and photographed, make them a natural pair. They're stylistically different: ""Killer of Sheep"" unfolds in fragmented vignettes; ""Bless Their Little Hearts"" has a straightforward narrative. But the movies share a star (Kaycee Moore), a setting (the Watts neighborhood), black-and-white cinematography and central questions about work, manhood and what it means to provide for a family. ""Killer of Sheep"": Rent or buy it at milestonefilms.com. ""Bless Their Little Hearts"": Stream it on the Criterion Channel; rent or buy it at milestonefilms.com.

Despite years of being hailed as a landmark, ""Killer of Sheep"" was difficult to see until 2007, when a restoration from Milestone Films resolved longstanding issues with the music rights. When I interviewed Burnett at the time, he expressed surprise at how far the movie had reached, saying it was made for discussion and schools. He wanted to put questions to viewers: How would they improve the life of the protagonist, Stan (Henry G. Sanders), a slaughterhouse worker? And what could be done for the community, where Burnett grew up?

Such pragmatic goals belie the movie's obvious poetry: a skyward shot of children leaping from roof to roof as if defying gravity; the incongruously upbeat counterpoint of William Grant Still's ""Afro-American"" Symphony as Stan cleans the floor of the slaughterhouse; a preoccupied Stan and his wife (Moore) slowly swaying in the shadows to Dinah Washington. The movie opens with a boy (unidentified, though probably young Stan) being admonished by his father for standing by while his sibling was embroiled in a fight: ""If anything was to happen to me or your mother, you ain't got nobody except your brother."" Devotion to family and home life is an ethic that the older Stan, introduced repairing a floor, has clearly taken to heart. On the surface, ""Killer of Sheep"" can look so spontaneous that Burnett appears almost to have happened upon it. (Early on, as the boys throw rocks at each other in a rubble-filled lot, it's initially difficult to tell whether they're fighting or playing.) But the verite veneer disguises the movie's pointed use of place and space. There is not much room in Stan's home: His wife, who is never given a name, is wearing a bathrobe when she walks in on him and a friend. Later, when the couple have an intimate conversation about his increasingly morose mood (""You never smile anymore. I used to think you was just tired""), their daughter fusses at the refrigerator in the background. The smallest distances become challenging to navigate: Stan cashes a check at a liquor store to get $15 for a replacement motor. After the purchase, he and a friend carry the heavy motor down a tight stairway, then place it in a truck -- a truck that is, regrettably, parked on a hill. And the one time ""Killer of Sheep"" exits the neighborhood -- the characters pile into a car for an excursion -- a flat tire thwarts the effort.

The grind has worn Stan down, yet he keeps going, with an attitude somewhere between acceptance and resignation. Early in ""Killer of Sheep,"" Stan says he ""can't get no sleep at night, no peace of mind."" A friend jokes that he is always awake counting sheep. If ""Killer of Sheep"" concerns the exhaustion of getting by, ""Bless Their Little Hearts"" is its counterpart -- a movie about the consequences of unemployment. Slumber is again a motif: The first words we hear from the protagonist, Charlie (Nate Hardman), are, ""You asleep?"" ""Bless Their Little Hearts"" opens with Charlie in an unemployment office, where he spots a sign: ""Are you interested in a casual labor job?"" Casual is underlined twice, and the offer specifies that the jobs will last up to three days.

The precise origins of Charlie's unemployment are never specified, but in ""Los Angeles Plays Itself,"" Andersen notes a moment when Charlie rides by a ""reverse landmark, one of the closed industrial plants that had once provided jobs for the black working class."" Over the course of ""Bless Their Little Hearts,"" Charlie takes brief gigs painting over gang tags or clearing brush, but permanent work eludes him. A friend suggests turning to robbery. ""If I didn't have a family that might be all right,"" Charlie replies. And as in ""Killer of Sheep,"" the family is a crowd. There's a long wait for the lone bathroom. When Charlie's daughter walks in on him shaving, he sends her out; when she gets her turn, the faucet knobs are shut so tight that, in a moment of levity, she fetches an industrial-size wrench to tap them loose. Though it is not freely acknowledged until the end, when Charlie allows himself to cry in his wife's arms, joblessness clearly poses a challenge to his manhood, a deficit he takes out on his son, chiding his hygiene: ""Little boys don't run around with their fingernails long. Little girls run around with their fingernails long,"" he tells him. (It's hard not to hear echoes of the father warning young Stan about his brother in ""Killer of Sheep."")

Charlie and his wife, Andais (Moore), don't even seem to keep the same hours. He is often awake while she is asleep. He lounges on a car hood or, after a hard day of labor, snores in the bathtub. Late in the film, a barber suggests that the key to success is being able to wake up early. As for Andais, she is shown in contrasting scenes riding the bus: in one, she nods off from fatigue; later, having discovered that Charlie is having an affair, she is wide awake. When the two finally fight about the fling, the scene, staged in a single take, feels utterly extemporaneous. Like ""Killer of Sheep,"" this is a movie so real, so personal, it appears drawn completely from life.","Charles Burnett's ""Killer of Sheep"" and Billy Woodberry's ""Bless Their Little Hearts"" were part of a movement putting the lived experience of black working-class characters onscreen.",552e61a5-f27b-5687-93db-4d67809096be,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/12/arts/11gateway-larebellion3/merlin_20716245_4d481edf-9eb5-4128-a7d1-65085553f161-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=e609b08f1ac9f7d0c9aee699e0a1915ad25f58c9fc15c8801c642a1a1bb2559f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Henry G.

Travel,8 Trips Inspired by Oscar-Nominated Films,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/travel/8-trips-inspired-by-oscar-nominated-films.html,"You know a film is a hit when a tourism office or a hotel marketing company starts suggesting a vacation inspired by it (e.g., ""50 Shades of Grey"" hotel packages and ""Hunger Games"" tours of Atlanta). But these can have a forced feel. There is a way to extend the feeling of seeing a movie by traveling to a place that calls to mind the themes it covers. This year, in time for the Oscars, we've put together a list of such destinations for each of the eight films nominated for best picture. This year's crop covers significant emotional ground. From the real Texas locations in ""Boyhood"" to the fictional European ones in ""The Grand Budapest Hotel,"" the nominees traverse a good amount of physical territory as well. For our list, some places match directly with locations shown in the film, while others evoke the spirit of their movies' narratives.

Film: The Theory of Everything At the beginning of James Marsh's film ""The Theory of Everything,"" the audience sees Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) as they are unlikely to have seen him before, biking with a friend through the streets of Cambridge. The energy of that moment is reflected in the lush greenery and the stately buildings that line their path. They bike past King's College Chapel, among other landmarks. They attend a party where Stephen first meets Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones). These early scenes, from rowing on the river Cam to attending classes at Cambridge University, give a sense of the beauty of the town, one demarcated by centuries-old architecture and varied activities. And they show the younger, more active days of a man whose physical capacities would by stunted by ALS. Viewers inspired by Dr. Hawking's youthful moments might be drawn to the sights Cambridge has to offer. One great way to do this is on a punting tour down the Cam to view the ""backs"" of the various Cambridge colleges. The town is great for biking and walking as well. The architecture of the churches is particularly notable, and a visit to King's College Chapel is essential, which includes the world's largest fan vault and panels of dramatic medieval stained glass. This year marks the 500th anniversary of the completion of its stonework. For art, visitors have their choice of a handful of museums, but the most robust collection is housed in the Fitzwilliam Museum. With its neo-Classical architecture, that museum is host to a stunning permanent collection, from ancient world art up to present-day paintings.

Because of its degree of secrecy, the work of the SEALs often seems more elusive than other parts of the military. Some of its workings are revealed -- even celebrated -- at the National Navy UDT-SEAL Museum, the only one devoted to presenting and remembering the work of this branch. Visitors can get a deeper understanding of the history of the special operations group and explore artifacts from past missions. One on view is the Maersk Alabama lifeboat where Capt. Richard Phillips was held hostage by Somali pirates until they were taken down by SEAL snipers. Another is the model of Osama bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, which was donated to the museum in 2012. The museum also includes models of ATVs used in Operation Desert Storm, and small submersibles used to send a groups of SEALs on covert maritime missions. A memorial is on the grounds, too, with a bronze sculpture of a combat swimmer as its centerpiece, to honor SEALs lost during battle.

Place: ""Sleep No More"" at the McKittrick Hotel, New York City ""Birdman,"" with its weaving camerawork, takes place mostly backstage in Broadway's St. James Theater. It follows its lead, the actor Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton), through the bowels of that theater, up and down stairs, through corridors and into cluttered rooms. The camera moves with Riggan and the other players throughout, following them onstage for performances. The St. James does not currently offer backstage tours (and is gearing up for a new musical, ""Something Rotten,"" to begin performances there in March), but there is a better way in New York to recreate the haunting, you-are-there experience of ""Birdman"": the production ""Sleep No More."" This mostly wordless show, at the McKittrick Hotel (which is a set of warehouses converted into a giant performance space) allows audience members to freely wander -- down corridors, up stairs, following its characters from one room to another. Sometimes that leads to a sequence where the cast gathers together in one large room. In the way that ""Birdman"" makes backstage part of the performance with unexpected turns, ""Sleep No More"" makes every one of its rooms theatrical, with a seemingly endless set of ways to experience it. The emotional scope of the film ""Boyhood"" is expansive, covering the life of the character Mason (Ellar Coltrane), from the ages of 6 to 18. Its setting is also expansive, taking place all around Texas, chronicling family relocations, road trips and milestones. The state helps to shape the characters in this drama, from the Austin-based filmmaker Richard Linklater. Austin plays host to many scenes, while San Marcos and Houston also factor in. But one scene near the film's end, in which Mason takes a hiking trip with new college friends and reflects on life, takes place in Texas's largest state park, Big Bend Ranch.

The writer and director Wes Anderson set his film ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" in a fictional location, the Republic of Zubrowka, placing the hotel of the title remotely at the top of a mountain. He and his production designer, Adam Stockhausen, looked at archival images of European vacation spots to come up with its look. They also took cues from the architecture of the Grandhotel Pupp in Karlovy Vary. That hotel, with its neo-Baroque architecture, reflects the classical feel of the hotel used in Mr. Anderson's film. Visitors have room options ranging from a single room (at a very reasonable rate) up to a presidential apartment, which includes a living room, dining room, bedroom and lush views of the town. The hotel also has a royal spa, with a steam bath, a salt cave and a relaxation pool. Patrons may also be interested in visiting the many hot springs around the town, like the Thermal Spring Colonnade, which sports a glass chimney. Grandhotel Pupp is no stranger to recent films. Shoots there have included ""Last Holiday"" and ""Casino Royale,"" both released in 2006.

Morten Tyldum's drama ""The Imitation Game"" looks at the life of the mathematician and codebreaker Alan Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch. Much of the film is set in Bletchley Park, the home base for the Government Code and Cypher School, where Mr. Turing and his team worked to crack the German Enigma codes during World War II. While the film was shot in other places that recreated portions of Bletchley Park, the filmmakers went to the real Bletchley Park, now a museum, for inspiration on the sets. They were given full access to the archives there to help them be as accurate as possible.

Rather than a film that spans the life of the minister and activist the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., ""Selma"" zeroes in on one period, the organizing and executing of the civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery. The period is short, but the film fully forms the spirit and character of Dr. King on-screen during this time. Fans of the film, and of Dr. King, can explore much deeper at the historic site in Atlanta centered on his boyhood home. That two-story home, at 501 Auburn Avenue, is open for guided tours each day. Other places worth exploring within the site include Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Dr. King was baptized. The church has undergone renovations to help restore some of its exteriors. The King Center includes the largest collection of archived source materials on the work of Dr. King. There, the crypt of Dr. King and Coretta Scott King sits on an island in the middle of a reflecting pool. One particularly beautiful part of the site is the ""I Have a Dream"" World Peace Rose Garden, which was initially planted in 1992. It's one of five such peace-promoting gardens around the world and was designed in color blocks to represent different areas of Dr. King's life and work.","From Cambridge to the Czech Republic, suggestions for where to go for each of the movies that were nominated for best picture this year.",10446ccc-5d9b-591a-8bf5-919668d662e2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/18/travel/18OSCARS1/18OSCARS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=833ee038dc65a243179cea93c78edb54a95f9c187680994df8cba1ea7d45fa1d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Cambridge, England, where ""The Theory of Everything"" was filmed.",10446ccc-5d9b-591a-8bf5-919668d662e2,N24News/imgs/10446ccc-5d9b-591a-8bf5-919668d662e2.jpg,4
Science,A 3.2-Million-Year-Old Mystery: Did Lucy Fall From a Tree?,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/30/science/lucy-hominid-fossils-fall.html,"In 1974, the paleoanthropologist Donald C. Johanson led an expedition to Ethiopia to look for fossils of ancient human relatives. In an expanse of arid badlands, he spotted an arm bone. Then, in the area surrounding it, Dr. Johanson and his colleagues found hundreds of other skeletal fragments. The fossils turned out to have come from a single three-foot-tall female who lived 3.2 million years ago. The scientists named her species Australopithecus afarensis, and the skeleton was dubbed Lucy. Four decades later, Lucy remains one of the most famous discoveries in paleontology. Finding a single bone of that age would have been reason to celebrate; finding so much from a skeleton revealed a tremendous amount about Lucy -- and about human evolution in general.

Her death, on the other hand, has been a mystery. Now, after poring over the celebrated bones, a team of scientists has concluded that Lucy died most unceremoniously: from a long fall out of a tree. If they are right, the discovery could yield an important clue to how our ancestors evolved from tree-dwelling apes into bipeds that walked the African savanna. But the new study has experts deeply divided. Some researchers are praising the research, while others, including Dr. Johanson, think the authors have failed to adequately make their case. The study, published on Monday in the journal Nature, came about because Lucy's skeleton -- normally housed at the National Museum of Ethiopia -- was taken on a tour of the United States in 2007. After a show at the Houston Museum of Natural Science, Lucy spent 10 days at the University of Texas at Austin, where scientists put her bones through a CT scanner. ""We just decided, by golly, we were going to scan every little bit of Lucy because it may never be done again,"" said John Kappelman, a paleoanthropologist at the university.

Last December, he noticed a puzzling break in Lucy's upper right arm. A look through surgical journals suggested that the break might be a so-called compressive fracture, in which a force pushes down on a bone, sometimes even driving one bone into another. What intrigued Dr. Kappelman was what could have caused such a compressive fracture: a fall from a great height. ""It's not something that would happen if you just tripped and fell,"" he said. Dr. Kappelman printed out a human-size, three-dimensional model of Lucy's shoulder and took it to Dr. Stephen Pearce, an orthopedic surgeon at the Austin Bone and Joint Clinic. Dr. Pearce agreed that the break was a compressive fracture. Other orthopedic surgeons consulted by Dr. Kappelman made the same diagnosis. Dr. Kappelman and his colleagues decided to inspect all of Lucy's bones for fractures that might have been caused by a fall. In addition to studying the virtual models, Dr. Kappelman examined the original fossils in Ethiopia. They found a number of breaks that looked as if they had occurred after Lucy died. But he also observed more compressive fractures, as well as so-called greenstick fractures, in which a bone cracks only on one side, much like what happens when a living tree branch breaks. Both kinds of fractures can happen during falls. Lucy sustained many such fractures, the scientists concluded, from her ankles to her jaw. The fractures suggest that she came down feet-first and then tumbled forward, holding out her hands in a futile hope of protecting herself.

""It tells us she was conscious when she reached the ground,"" Dr. Kappelman said. If so, Lucy did not stay conscious for long. The fractures to her rib cage suggest crushing injuries to her internal organs that would have killed her. Dr. Kappelman and his colleagues believe Lucy must have fallen from a tree. They base that conclusion on what geologists have determined about the environment where she lived: At the time, it was a low-lying wooded area around a stream, with no cliffs nearby.

William L. Jungers, a paleoanthropologist at Stony Brook University who was not involved in the research, called it ""a provocative but plausible scenario."" Laura Martin-Frances, a postdoctoral researcher at the National Research Centre on Human Evolution in Burgos, Spain, said she was impressed with the level of detail in the study. ""For me, it's quite accurate what they have done,"" Dr. Martin-Frances said. But other experts said Dr. Kappelman and his colleagues had not done enough to rule out other explanations for the fractures. Ericka N. L'Abbe, a professor of anthropology at the University of Pretoria in South Africa, said that when living bones break, some parts bend. A close inspection of Lucy's bones might have revealed traces of that bending.

""The major drawback is that they didn't look under a microscope,"" Dr. L'Abbe said. Dr. Johanson said it was far more likely that the fractures Dr. Kappelman attributes to a fall had occurred long after her death, as her skeleton was buried under sand. ""Elephant bones and hippo ribs appear to have the same kind of breakage,"" Dr. Johanson said. ""It's unlikely they fell out of a tree."" Monkeys and apes spend a lot of time in trees and have impressive adaptations for that sort of life. One of the most striking features of Lucy's skeleton is the shape of her leg and knee bones, which look suited for walking on the ground instead. Since the discovery of Lucy, paleoanthropologists have found more fossils from Australopithecus afarensis. They suggest Lucy had flat feet and other traits needed for walking. Some researchers have argued that by Lucy's time, our forerunners were no longer good tree-climbers, having evolved to find food on the ground. ""Australopithecus afarensis was essentially a terrestrial animal,"" Dr. Johanson said.

Some researchers have even argued that our distant ancestors originally evolved bipedalism in the trees for walking on branches. ""This is a big debate,"" said William Harcourt-Smith, an anthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History. Dr. Kappelman and his colleagues considered the possibility that Lucy fell out of a nest in which she was sleeping. Chimpanzees build their nests an average of 40 feet above the ground. A fall from that height could have killed Lucy, the scientists calculated. But Nathaniel Dominy, an evolutionary biologist at Dartmouth College, considers it unlikely. ""For me, the much more likely scenario is that she was climbing for food,"" he said. Chimpanzees sometimes gather honey from hives that are far above their nests. They have to use one hand to hold on to a branch while jabbing a stick into a hive with the other. ""Lucy was just enduring the stings as a chimpanzee would. It would be intense,"" Dr. Dominy said. Dr. Kappelman has received permission from the Ethiopian government to post the bone data online, and he hopes his critics will look closely for themselves. At eLucy.org, scientists and schoolchildren alike will be able to download three-dimensional renderings and inspect them on a computer -- or even print out casts of Lucy's bones on 3-D printers. ""I'm happy that the 3-D files are out there,"" Dr. Kappelman said. ""People can much more fully evaluate our hypothesis by looking at them, and it will be fun to see where it goes.""","A team of scientists recently concluded that Lucy, a hominid whose skeleton was discovered in 1974, died from a long fall — but their study has divided experts.",d72a3623-11ab-5bfc-9cea-18bee6d26ca5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/30/science/30ZIMMERWEB1/30ZIMMERWEB1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=9043f49df599fe83b1412501c55f00c913444e543cd1df5811a9e6184f773222&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"John Kappelman, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Texas at Austin, with 3-D printouts of Lucy's skeleton.",d72a3623-11ab-5bfc-9cea-18bee6d26ca5,N24News/imgs/d72a3623-11ab-5bfc-9cea-18bee6d26ca5.jpg,2
Health,Hospital Giants Vie for Patients in Effort to Fend Off New Rivals,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/health/hospitals-mergers-patients.html,"It's all about the patient. Or at least about keeping patients and the revenue generated for their medical care. As health care is rocked by deals aimed at shattering traditional boundaries between businesses, some of the nation's biggest hospital groups are doubling down on mergers that seem much more conventional. Skeptics say some of these hospital deals are more of the same: systems seeking to increase their leverage with insurance companies and charge more for care. In just the last few weeks, several of the nation's largest nonprofit hospital systems have announced plans to become even larger behemoths. Dignity Health and Catholic Health Initiatives said they planned to become a national chain of Catholic hospitals and clinics that spanned 28 states. Two Midwestern systems want to combine to become one of the country's largest nonprofits, and Ascension, which is already the nation's largest nonprofit health system, is said to be in talks to become even bigger, according to The Wall Street Journal. Ascension declined to comment. But the frenzy of mergers and other alliances taking place also reveals a frantic attempt to court and capture patients as people have more choices about where to go for care. Patients are increasingly relying on walk-in clinics, urgent care centers or an app on their cellphone to check out a nasty rash or monitor their diabetes, and they are looking for places that are both less expensive and more convenient than a hospital emergency room or doctor's office.

The battle is over ""the control of the patient,"" said Rob Fuller, a heath care lawyer at Nelson Hardiman and a former hospital administrator. As hospital executives see the continued decline of care being delivered within a hospital's four walls, he said they want to make sure they still have a say over where patients go after a hospital stay or to get treatment for a chronic condition. Hospitals competing for patients is a game of musical chairs, and ""there might not be a chair for you,"" agreed Kenneth Kaufman, chair of Kaufman Hall, a firm that consults with hospitals. Hospital executives are realizing that someone else, including an insurance company employing the nurse at a walk-in clinic or the doctor at a surgery center, wants to take over their relationship with patients -- and the potential revenue that those patients represent. And the move by the insurers into their traditional territory is making some institutions very nervous. UnitedHealth Group, the giant insurer, is viewed as the greatest threat, underscored by its recent purchase of DaVita Medical Group. The company, which has a diverse portfolio of health care businesses, already has a roster of some 30,000 doctors under its Optum unit, and a chain of surgery centers. The company ""has moved out ahead from a competitive perspective and a model perspective,"" Mr. Kaufman said. The proposed merger of CVS Health, which operates drugstores and a large pharmacy benefit manager, with Aetna, an insurer, also promises to reinvent care by transforming CVS' roughly 10,000 drugstores into ""health care hubs,"" where patients can easily seek advice or treatment for anything from a sore throat to heart disease. There is also the rumor that Amazon, which has already upended retailers like book stores and grocery chains, could enter the pharmacy business. ""Hospitals are very nervous about being small fry in the changing health care landscape,"" said Leemore S. Dafny, a professor at Harvard Business School. Consumers frequently pay more when hospitals combine in the same market because the larger entity has more clout, she said, and there is some evidence that prices rise even when the hospital groups are in different markets in the same state.

But these combinations will create more than large chains of hospitals. The hospital systems already include medical clinics, employ doctors and provide services ranging from imaging to care at home. Dignity and Catholic Health Initiatives say their proposed deal would create a system that would consist of 139 hospitals, more than 700 sites of care and employ more than 25,000 doctors and other clinicians. The two systems will have annual revenue of roughly $30 billion a year. The mergers allow these systems to become much larger ""and have much stronger tentacles into the patient population they are trying to reach,' said W. Kenneth Marlow, a health care lawyer with Waller Lansden Dortch and Davis. The Affordable Care Act masked some of those underlying challenges facing hospitals by supplying a new source of insured patients, and the relative lull in merger activity since the law took effect reflected better financial footing. But the industry is now back to looking at shrinking profit margins and a decline in their core revenues. The Republicans' proposed tax overhaul could make it even worse by forcing cuts to government programs like Medicare and Medicaid. ""Coming together will allow us to be better prepared to weather the storms,"" acknowledged Jim Skogsbergh, the chief executive of Advocate Health Care, which had been foiled by antitrust officials in its earlier attempt to merge with another Chicago-area health system before deciding to combine with Aurora Health Care. The changing industry dynamics have also caused some of the nation's largest chains of for-profit hospitals, like Tenet Healthcare and Community Health Systems, to struggle. In addition to shifting their focus to outpatient care, those groups have been shedding some of their weakest hospitals. In talking about the most recent mergers, much of the reasoning sounds familiar, including the promises around how being bigger will allow the hospital systems to achieve cost savings. Dignity and Catholic Health Initiatives, for example, estimate about $500 million in efficiencies through their merger, and many of the groups point to a larger scale being necessary to pay for the sophisticated computer systems needed to better oversee patients. But many point to the promises of past mergers as reason to doubt whether the hospital mergers allow much more than an ability to demand higher prices from insurers. After the last wave of mergers that took place a few years ago, the hospitals didn't use that opportunity to bring their costs down, said Bret Schroeder at PA Consulting Group. They ""still aren't that much more efficient than they were,"" he said.

Getting hospitals to change as a result of these mergers will remain difficult, Mr. Schroeder said. ""It's very hard for an industry that has been fairly monopolistic within a region to think way outside of the box,"" he said. Although all of the mergers and acquisitions will have to pass muster with federal and state antitrust officials, the recent combinations, even among hospitals merging with hospitals, generally involve facilities that are not direct competitors. Advocate, based in Illinois, is merging with a system in the neighboring state of Wisconsin. Dignity, which is based in San Francisco, and Catholic Health Initiatives, from Englewood, Colo., both products of earlier mergers, also say their locations do not overlap. The systems also insist they are not looking to get bigger for the sake of being able to throw their size around. ""It's a very old model of thinking about size and higher price,"" said Dr. Nick Turkal, the chief executive of Aurora. They say they are already investing in new ways to deliver care at less expense, and the combinations will allow them to intensify those efforts. ""We're going to be focusing on becoming more efficient, certainly, and creating products that can be sold very competitively,"" said Mr. Skogsbergh of Advocate. In announcing their planned merger earlier this month, Dignity and Catholic Health Initiatives, which declined requests for interviews, said they plan to use the merger to amplify their investments in ""community-based care,"" which they describe as ""a variety of outpatient and virtual care settings closer to home"" as well as programs aimed at people with chronic health conditions. ""We believe together we can build a stronger platform to foster healthier communities,"" Lloyd Dean, the chief executive of Dignity, said in speaking about the deal earlier this year. Hospitals will have no choice but to use these mergers to reinvent themselves rather than simply raise prices, said Thomas Cassels, a consultant at the Advisory Board, which was recently acquired by UnitedHealth Group's Optum unit. They know patients can go somewhere else, he said.","The flurry of mergers among big hospital groups is aimed at retaining patients while new competitors, including insurance giants and technology outfits, try to steal them away.",e7b8d4c2-1dac-5765-875e-abf339ddbd31,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/19/science/19MERGE/19MERGE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=ba63edd5eeff1a02f4c99da3ec9c3d0a20fe1044f041f8a8b433247911a6c8d0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The headquarters in Englewood, Colo., of Catholic Health Initiatives, a nonprofit hospital system that plans to merge with Dignity Health in San Francisco.",e7b8d4c2-1dac-5765-875e-abf339ddbd31,N24News/imgs/e7b8d4c2-1dac-5765-875e-abf339ddbd31.jpg,1
Media,Fox Settles With Gretchen Carlson Over Roger Ailes Sex Harassment Claims,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/07/business/media/fox-news-roger-ailes-gretchen-carlson-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-settlement.html,"Fox News's parent company spent $20 million on Tuesday to settle a lawsuit brought by a former anchor, Gretchen Carlson, whose allegations of sexual harassment toppled the network's powerful chairman, Roger Ailes, and engulfed the company in crisis. But if the settlement was meant to signal the close of a damaging chapter for the network, it fell short. Fox's newsroom was hit minutes later by a new shock wave: Greta Van Susteren, one of the channel's best-known and longest-serving hosts, was leaving, effective immediately. Network officials insisted that the timing was coincidental. But the settlement, combined with Ms. Van Susteren's abrupt departure, underscored the continuing tumult inside Fox News, whose newsroom, once proudly defiant, has been besieged this summer by new allegations of harassment and persistent rumors about turnover in the on-air and executive ranks. These days, it seems, the end of one Fox drama is only the start of another. Stars like Megyn Kelly and Bill O'Reilly have contracts that expire next year, and Ms. Van Susteren's exit on Tuesday was taken as an unsettling sign of change. It is unclear whether Fox News, without Mr. Ailes at the helm, can maintain its political clout in a disruptive election season.

The uproar is somewhat puzzling for Rupert Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan, who control Fox News's owner, 21st Century Fox. They say they have taken extraordinary steps to address problems at the network, which is still the highest-ranked cable news network in the country, beginning with their swift removal of Mr. Ailes. Specialists in employment law described the $20 million payout to Ms. Carlson -- a figure confirmed by a person briefed on the agreement -- as among the largest-known settlements for a single-plaintiff sexual harassment suit. (Mr. Ailes, who received $40 million from Fox as part of his exit agreement, is not paying any portion of the settlement.) Fox has also settled with at least two other women who came forward with complaints about Mr. Ailes, the person said. And the company issued a rare public apology to Ms. Carlson, ""for the fact that Gretchen was not treated with the respect and dignity that she and all of our colleagues deserve.""

But tensions remain among the network rank-and-file. Mr. Murdoch, who now presides over Fox News as executive chairman, kept in place several of Mr. Ailes's most loyal deputies and recently promoted them to leadership roles, troubling employees who had hoped for a clean slate. The reasons behind Ms. Van Susteren's departure remained murky, but people on both sides of the negotiations pointed to an icy meeting in July between Ms. Van Susteren and Rupert Murdoch as a turning point in her tenure. Days after Mr. Ailes's exit, Ms. Van Susteren met with Mr. Murdoch in his second-floor office inside Fox's Manhattan headquarters. The anchor, accompanied by her husband and agent, John P. Coale, requested more favorable terms to her contract -- which was not immediately up for renewal -- and cited an exit clause that allowed her to leave the network in the event that Mr. Ailes was no longer chairman. Mr. Murdoch was not impressed, both sides say. ""It was tense,"" Mr. Coale recalled in a telephone interview on Tuesday.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Late last week, Ms. Van Susteren informed Fox that she planned to invoke her exit clause. But she woke up on Tuesday fully expecting to tape her prime-time show, ""On the Record,"" that evening. Instead, Mr. Coale said, ""someone came to our house and delivered two letters"" from the network. The message: ""She's out."" It was so abrupt that a large-scale poster of Ms. Van Susteren, who routinely beat the cable competition in her 7 p.m. time slot, was still displayed outside Fox's Manhattan building when the announcement went out. (The poster was removed later on Tuesday.) Inside the channel's Washington bureau, newspapers sat untouched outside Ms. Van Susteren's still-full office. Ms. Van Susteren had initially defended Mr. Ailes, calling Ms. Carlson ""disgruntled"" and saying that the timing of her lawsuit ""is very suspicious."" But on Tuesday, in a farewell post on Facebook, Ms. Van Susteren wrote: ""Fox has not felt like home to me for a few years.""

Mr. Coale, in the interview, echoed that sentiment. ""There's so much chaos"" at Fox, he said. ""It's very hard to work there."" Asked why his wife had exercised the exit clause, Mr. Coale said, ""There's more than meets the eye,"" adding that there ""might be litigation in the future."" But he provided no further details. Ms. Van Susteren, on Facebook, wrote that she had to leave the network now because of a time limit on her exit clause. Brit Hume, a veteran Fox political anchor, took over hosting duties for Ms. Van Susteren's show on Tuesday and is expected to continue through the election. ""I count Greta a friend and I'm sorry to see her go,"" Mr. Hume said at the conclusion of Tuesday's broadcast. Although she has been a Fox fixture since 2002, Ms. Van Susteren does not command the same star power as Ms. Kelly or Mr. O'Reilly. Fox News executives on Tuesday dismissed the notion that her departure signaled tough times ahead, noting that the channel has scored record ratings this year. ""Fox News has never been stronger,"" the network's co-presidents, Jack Abernethy and Bill Shine, said in a statement. Ms. Van Susteren's exit was viewed by Fox officials as a less consequential development than the company's settlement with Ms. Carlson, whose suit initially faced a legal challenge from Mr. Ailes. The evidence that Ms. Carlson had against Mr. Ailes was damning, according to another person with knowledge of the settlement: For a year and a half, she had recorded her meetings with Mr. Ailes on her mobile phone. (In an interview with The New York Times in July, Ms. Carlson said she recalled ""between six and 10"" conversations with Mr. Ailes when the chairman made provocative comments.)

Most of the remarks that she attributed to Mr. Ailes in her lawsuit -- including lines like, ""I think you and I should have had a sexual relationship a long time ago, and then you'd be good and better and I'd be good and better"" -- were taken straight from those recordings, the person said. Officials at 21st Century Fox became aware of the recordings about three weeks after Ms. Carlson filed her lawsuit, the person said, after Ms. Carlson's lawyers spoke to investigators from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, the law firm hired to look into the accusations against Mr. Ailes. (About 20 women at Fox have come forward during the firm's inquiry to describe inappropriate behavior by Mr. Ailes.) Settlement talks started shortly thereafter, and a deal was reached in mid-August, the person said. Ms. Carlson sued Mr. Ailes alone, but 21st Century Fox, which acts as Mr. Ailes's corporate indemnifier, will pay the settlement. As part of the arrangement, which was first reported on Tuesday by Vanity Fair, Ms. Carlson signed a confidentiality agreement. In a sign that Ms. Carlson is not going to shrink from the spotlight, she recently hired the power publicist Cindi Berger of PMK BNC to represent her. She issued a statement on Tuesday saying she was ""ready to move on to the next chapter of my life, in which I will redouble my efforts to empower women in the workplace.""","In a separate development, Fox News announced that Greta Van Susteren was leaving the network, effective immediately.",440be007-764a-5e2a-8718-ceb58818df8f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/07/business/07fox1/07fox1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=d620b4549c5cfbdbcac88e685fd1598d0b3de6242d85c53c03f6da83eda85667&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Gretchen Carlson, a former anchor at Fox News, filed suit on July 6, leading to Roger Ailes's ouster two weeks later.",440be007-764a-5e2a-8718-ceb58818df8f,N24News/imgs/440be007-764a-5e2a-8718-ceb58818df8f.jpg,16
Books,Illuminating Islam's Peaceful Origins,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/books/review/illuminating-islams-peaceful-origins.html,"GOD IN THE QUR'AN

 By Jack Miles

 241 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.95. MUHAMMAD

 Prophet of Peace Amid the Clash of Empires

 By Juan Cole 

326 pp. Nation Books. $28. Is Allah, the God of Muslims, a different deity from the one worshiped by Jews and Christians? Is he even perhaps a strange ""moon god,"" a relic from Arab paganism, as some anti-Islamic polemicists have argued? What about Allah's apostle, Muhammad? Was he a militant prophet who imposed his new religion by the sword, leaving a bellicose legacy that still drives today's Muslim terrorists? Two new books may help answer such questions, and also give a deeper understanding of Islam's theology and history.

Jack Miles, a professor of religion at the University of California and the author of the Pulitzer-winning book ""God: A Biography,"" has written ""God in the Qur'an."" It is a highly readable, unbiasedly comparative and elegantly insightful study of the Quran, in which he sets out to show that the three great monotheistic religions do indeed believe in the same deity -- although they have ""different emphases"" when it comes to this God, which accounts for their divergent theologies. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

* Listen to our podcast: Featuring conversations with leading figures in the literary world, from Colson Whitehead to Leila Slimani, the Book Review Podcast helps you delve deeper into your favorite books. To begin with, one should not doubt that Allah is Yahweh, the God of the Bible, because that is what he himself says. The Quran's ""divine speaker,"" Miles writes, ""does identify himself as the God whom Jews and Christians worship and the author of their Scriptures."" That is also why Allah reiterates, often with much less detail, many of the same stories we read in the Bible about Yahweh and his interventions in human history. The little nuances between these stories, however, are distinctions with major implications. Take, for example, the story of Abraham, which is so central to both the Bible and the Quran. Miles examines Abraham in both and highlights a key difference: In the Bible, Abraham is presented as the father of a great nation that will multiply and inherit a holy land. ""To your descendants I give this country,"" Yahweh vows, ""from the River of Egypt to the Great River."" In the Quran, however, the stress is on Abraham as the great champion of monotheism against idolatry: His biggest mission is smashing the idols -- a story foretold not in the Bible, but in an ancient rabbinical exegesis of it, a midrash. ""Yahweh is a fertility god,"" Miles provocatively suggests, whereas ""Allah is a theolatry god"" -- theolatry meaning the worshiping of God alone. The story of Moses, again a crucial one in both the Bible and the Quran, comes with similar nuance. In the Bible, the great mission of Moses is to liberate his people, the children of Israel, from the yoke of the Pharaoh. In the Quran, too, Moses rises up against the Pharaoh, but his main problem is that the Pharaoh and his people worship false gods. Yahweh ""wants to defeat Pharaoh,"" Miles observes, for he has ""no intention of ever becoming Egypt's God."" In contrast, Allah wants to convert Pharaoh and to make all Egypt monotheist. Through such scriptural comparisons, Miles gets to the core of the Abrahamic matrix: The monotheism that the Jewish people developed over the centuries was inherited by Islam and was turned into a global creed. All the national elements within Judaism, meanwhile, were then muted.

What about Christianity, the third, and the largest, piece of the matrix? It seems to be, just like Islam, a universalization of Judaic monotheism. But Christianity introduced a new theological element to the scene -- a divine Christ and triune Godhead -- which proved unacceptable to both Judaism and Islam. In the chapter comparing the Quran with the New Testament, Miles shows this by explaining how Islam rejects Christian theology, while showing great respect for Jesus Christ and Mary. He also sees ""a brilliant symmetry"" in how Islam combined Judaism's criticism of Christian theology with Christianity's criticism of Jewish particularism. The book underlines other distinctions between Yahweh and Allah. The former comes across as more disputable and ""less absolute and overwhelming."" Allah, on the other hand, appears as more ""compassionate."" And while Allah offers both great promises and threats for the afterlife, Yahweh is focused on this world. In observing such nuances, Miles, a Christian, is as objective, fair and gracious as one can get. In the beginning, he declares his own ""suspension of disbelief,"" which means letting go of his non-Muslimness and reading the Quran on its own terms. At the end, he turns back to his faith and reminds us: ""The Bible is my Scripture, the Quran is theirs."" Yet by reading the latter with respect, he thinks non-Muslims can find it ""a little easier to trust the Muslim next door, thinking of him as someone whose religion, after all, may not be so wildly unreasonable."" Non-Muslims who take the time to read the Quran may end up feeling a bit baffled, though. For they will hear a lot about Abraham, Moses, Joseph or Jesus, but almost nothing about the person they may be expecting the most: Muhammad. For while the Quran often speaks to Muhammad, it almost never speaks about him. That is why the Islamic tradition developed a post-Quranic literature on the life and times of Muhammad, recorded in the books of sira, or biography. And a cutting-edge version of sira comes from the pen of Juan Cole, a professor of history at the University of Michigan and the author of the popular blog Informed Comment. Cole's book, ""Muhammad: Prophet of Peace Amid the Clash of Empires,"" is not just eruditely informative, but also ambitiously revisionist, with two unorthodox arguments he keenly advances throughout the book. The first argument links the birth of Islam in early-seventh-century Arabia to the major geopolitical conflict of the time -- the clash between the Christian Byzantine Empire based in Constantinople and the Zoroastrian Sasanian Empire based in today's Iran. Cole's starting point is the Quranic sura, or chapter, titled ""Romans."" ""The Byzantines have been defeated in a nearby land,"" it reports, but also heralds that their victory will come soon, adding that ""on that day, the believers will rejoice."" This famous passage has traditionally been taken as an indication of sympathy among early Muslims for Christians as fellow monotheists against pagan enemies. But Cole thinks there is much more to it, postulating an alliance with Rome in which Muslims became ""members of the eastern Roman Commonwealth."" It is an interesting theory to consider.

Cole's second argument is more important. Going against familiar if not frequent militant images of the Prophet Muhammad in the West, he portrays Islam's founder as a peacemaker who wanted only to preach his monotheism freely and who even tried to establish ""multicultural"" harmony. The first years of Muhammad's mission, which he spent as the leader of an oppressed minority in Mecca, provides ample evidence to support this argument. The next decade in Medina, during which swords were unsheathed and battles were fought, complicates it. Cole solves the problem by advancing the explanation that modern Muslims typically offer: All these wars by the Prophet Muhammad were ""defensive"" in nature, fitting into a vision of ""just war."" Cole goes as far as rejecting some of the violent episodes attributed to the Prophet Muhammad as later fictions by belligerent Muslim empires. These include the most disturbing incident of all, the massacre of the male members of a Jewish tribe in Medina for collaborating with the pagan besiegers -- a story doubted also by a few Muslims, including myself. Cole may be the first, though, to doubt the Tabuk Expedition, a would-be battle between the armies of the Prophet Muhammad and the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius. Some of Cole's well-intentioned hypotheses, clearly aimed at challenging Islamophobia, may never be proved. But he is demonstrably right in concluding that Islamic orthodoxy deviated from its foundations by ""abrogating"" the peaceful and tolerant verses of the Quran, by reserving salvation only to Muslims, or by adopting some cruel practices like stoning. Beneath this thick layer of what became Islamic tradition, there is a more uplifting image of the Prophet Muhammad, waiting to be discovered not just by non-Muslims, but also many Muslims themselves.","Two new books, Jack Miles's ""God in the Qur'an"" and Juan Cole's ""Muhammad,"" go back to the sources of the Muslim faith.",cfdcc7b1-21fd-5e72-b0bb-b9b51046674e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/30/books/review/30AKYOL/30AKYOL-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=7c57ebf28dde3b7956821ede13127ddfbfe605a8748064f4c4df2ac9468bd0bd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A student recites from the Quran.,cfdcc7b1-21fd-5e72-b0bb-b9b51046674e,N24News/imgs/cfdcc7b1-21fd-5e72-b0bb-b9b51046674e.jpg,13
Automobiles,G.M. to Expand Small-Car Recall to 1.4 Million Vehicles,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/26/automobiles/gm-to-expand-small-car-recall-to-1-4-million-vehicles.html,"General Motors will more than double the size of a recall issued this month for an ignition switch defect in some of its small cars, the automaker said in a news release Tuesday. The expansion brings the number of vehicles covered by the recall to nearly 1.4 million in the United States.

The recall is aimed at vehicles with ignition switches that could inadvertently turn off the engine and vehicle electrical system - disabling the air bags - if the ignition key is jarred or the vehicle's operator has a heavy key ring attached to it.

G.M. said in the release that it was now aware of the deaths of 13 front-seat occupants in crashes where the front air bags did not deploy.

G.M. had previously recalled about 619,000 vehicles in the United States, including Chevrolet Cobalts from the 2005-7 model years and 2007 Pontiac G5 models. Now the automaker is adding 2003-7 Saturn Ions, 2006-7 Chevrolet HHRs and 2006-7 Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky models.","By including vehicles mentioned in a 2006 technical service bulletin, G.M. nearly doubled an ignition-switch recall.",8e59f842-41c8-5736-b839-dfbcc4449271,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/26/automobiles/26GMRECALL-image/26GMRECALL-image-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=359&w=600&s=8a09caf5b238ac516642761b7a6bed8aadbf9b5b968fd75835e8c4fca88d96d5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,The 2007 Pontiac Solstice.,8e59f842-41c8-5736-b839-dfbcc4449271,N24News/imgs/8e59f842-41c8-5736-b839-dfbcc4449271.jpg,23

While the prize has mostly gone to novelists, including Salman Rushdie and Toni Morrison, Mr. Sondheim has made an undeniable impact on the last 60 years of culture by writing musicals including ""West Side Story,"" ""Sweeney Todd"" and ""Company.""

And the precedent for giving a literary award to a musical artist was strengthened last year, when Bob Dylan accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature.

Media,HBO Unexpectedly Cancels Low-Rated 'Vinyl' After One Season,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/business/media/hbo-unexpectedly-cancels-low-rated-vinyl.html,"The good news for HBO: ""Game of Thrones,"" still enormously popular after six seasons, will close out another successful season Sunday night. But elsewhere in its slate of dramas, HBO continues to confront headwinds, a problem underscored on Wednesday when the cable network threw in the towel on ""Vinyl,"" an expensive and highly promoted series that nonetheless fizzled in its first season. The cancellation of ""Vinyl,"" a 1970s rock 'n' roll drama created by Mick Jagger and Martin Scorsese, represented a reversal for the cable network, which announced in February, shortly after the show's premiere, that it would bring it back for a second season. But ""Vinyl"" was troubled from the outset by a series of problems. ""Vinyl"" had difficulty finding traction. Its two-hour debut episode drew a lackluster 1.1 million viewers, according to Nielsen data measuring live viewing and three days of delayed viewing. For the week, that viewership total put it in the neighborhood of Bravo's ""Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce"" and TV Land's ""Younger.""

All of this comes at a time when there is more scripted television than ever and HBO is facing stiff competition from streaming services like Netflix and Amazon. With little momentum on the drama front, HBO has moved its attention elsewhere, including to the Wednesday-night debut of Bill Simmons's new show. The premium cable channel has also acquired programming ranging from ""Sesame Street"" to a new ""Vice"" daily newscast that is expected to have its premiere this fall. In an interview last year, Mr. Lombardo, the former president, spoke bluntly about the complexities and potential pitfalls of doing dramas. ""Do we want to do another drama series? No,"" he said. ""Unless it has the potential to be great. What we're looking to do is offer a variety of kinds of television entertainment engagement experiences."" Still, even as HBO finds itself without a recent drama hit, it does remain a go-to destination for some of the most talented filmmakers in Hollywood. It cleaned up at the Emmys last year, propelled by ""Game of Thrones"" and its mini-series ""Olive Kitteridge."" Next month, HBO will air the hotly anticipated limited series starring John Turturro called ""The Night Of."" And it also remains a vibrant home for comedies, with critically praised shows like ""Veep,"" ""Silicon Valley,"" ""Girls'' and ""Last Week Tonight With John Oliver."" Just last week, HBO said that Larry David's ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" would return for a ninth season after an extended hiatus.","The program, a 1970s music drama created by Mick Jagger and Martin Scorsese, was besieged by a series of problems following the end of the first season in April.",45861486-3f52-5e15-964e-f221422297c8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/23/business/23VINYL/23VINYL-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=331aa8111f0b832a700753ba1e2e34e961910a233982e3121e790b64a2ba77f2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A scene from ""Vinyl,"" starring Bobby Cannavale.

Instead of Spanish Revival next door to Polynesian fantasy, we get snide alt-weekly riffing alongside academic theory, punctuated by lots of delightfully shunpike Southern California lore. Some passages read as if written years apart for different conferences. There's nothing wrong with an essay collection, of course -- unless it's posing as a cohesive tour de force of cultural history.

Disconcerting lapses pop up along the way. The author has F. Scott Fitzgerald writing his Hollywood stories in the 1940s. Alas, Fitzgerald died of a heart attack in 1940, one day before a car accident killed his friend Nathanael West -- whose ""Day of the Locust"" Lunenfeld calls Los Angeles's ""first truly great novel,"" even though Raymond Chandler's ""The Big Sleep"" came out fully three months before. New York fact checkers who couldn't find California with a map and a flashlight are an old joke around here, but Lunenfeld shouldn't have needed rescuing in the first place.

Of course, nit-picking is for chimps. Bad prose is something else. Lunenfeld writes that an ""alchemical map of a Los Angeles reimagined transmutes the elements, diagraming a connectionist platzgeist."" When you hear people talk about doing away with academic tenure, sentences like that help explain why.

Deep into the book, though, the damnedest thing happens. Lunenfeld gets out of his own way for a spell, and the prose starts to bloom. Chapter 5, for instance, his bracingly original account of the generational leap from '50s dads in the military to their rock-star kids -- among them Jim Morrison and Gram Parsons -- will more than reward a masked expedition to the bookstore.

She hopes to draw attention to organ donation and supporting dog shelters.

A Woman, Her Best Friend, and a Quick Walk Down the Aisle?

Lilly Smartelli dreams of marrying her best friend on Valentine's Day. ""Bernie and I have been looking for just the right wedding venue to stage our big Italian wedding,"" said Ms. Smartelli, 55, who lives in Phoenix. Ms. Smartelli marks Feb. 14 on her calendar, not as a romantic holiday, but as a day defined by comfort, happiness and a different sort of true love. She found all of those things in Bernie, who happens to be one of the main characters in a book she self-published last October called, ""The $5 Dog Wedding."" He also happens to be a dog. ""I love Bernie to death and I know he's going to make quite a handsome groom,"" Ms. Smartelli said. ""But there is one problem where our wedding is concerned.""

The fact that Bernie is a dog? ""No,"" she said, laughing. ""The fact that we simply cannot afford the wedding we have planned."" Ms. Smartelli, a former travel nurse, is terminally ill, suffering from a form of pulmonary fibrosis, a respiratory disease in which scars are formed in the lung tissues, leading to serious breathing problems that worsen over time. ""My doctors tell me I have maybe one or two good years left,"" she said, ""so Bernie and I are racing against the clock.""

She eventually began suffering from shortness of breath, dizziness and fainting spells, which led to a diagnosis of pulmonary diffusion defect, a subcategory of pulmonary fibrosis. She sold the boat and moved to Phoenix, where she began evaluating her life, not knowing how much of it she had left, and came away with one final wish: to know the joy of a wedding day. ""By marrying Bernie in a symbolic way, I could draw attention to organ-donor groups and local animal welfare shelters that lack proper funding,"" Ms. Smartelli said between labored breaths. So her potential big day will serve as a fund-raising awareness moment for the two causes close to her heart. ""It's all in good fun,"" she said. ""I know I will never be married, but I would still love to experience the kind of wedding, even if it's a fake wedding, that I've been dreaming about since I was a little girl."" Ms. Smartelli chuckled when she said, ""I've been involved in just one-and-a-half relationships my entire life,"" and sighed when she added, ""I've been single for quite a while."" She needed a significant other to make her a bucket-list item a reality, so she turned to Bernie, her best friend, to play the role of groom.

Ms. Smartelli grew up in Detroit, where 12 years ago she spread some serious love of her own, coming to the rescue of a childhood friend by donating a kidney to him. ""I thought, if I could do something to help this person extend his life, then why not do it,"" she said. ""He's doing pretty well today, and he sends me a card once a year thanking me for what I did for him."" Chris Stewart, the manager of the Sun City Pet Market in Sun City, Ariz., has seen her kindness and unselfishness in his store. ""She's really no different than anyone else who comes in here and treats their dogs like members of their family,"" he said. ""When she's with Bernie and Spinner, I can see the love she has for them just pouring out of her."" Ms. Smartelli graduated from Wayne State University in Detroit, and holds a doctorate of chiropractic medicine from Cleveland Chiropractic College in Kansas City, Mo., as well as a nursing degree from Excelsior College in Albany. She says the experience of sacrificing a kidney ""really, truly highlights the importance of donor organizations."" Before her illness, Ms. Smartelli was working as a travel nurse throughout the country, taking eight-week assignments in such cities as San Antonio, Dallas, Albuquerque, Palm Springs, Los Angeles and Denver.

Though there is no cure for her condition and no sacrifice that will put time back on her earthly clock, Ms. Smartelli said she still hopes to help save the lives of human beings and dogs by raising awareness, and money. She has already been donating a portion of her book's proceeds to Donate Life America, a nonprofit organization working to increase the number of donated organs, eyes and tissue. ""Any 'wedding gifts' I receive,"" she said, ""would go straight to both of those causes."" She began considering a faux marriage to Bernie in October 2017, when she brought him to a dog groomer in Phoenix and mused, ""I may as well marry Bernie. He's always there for me. He listens, and he loves me no matter what. What more could a woman want?""

With her parents deceased and no family members or friends to turn to for financial support, she has managed to keep a sense of humor as she copes with her debilitating disease. ""People who see only a headline that says I want to marry Bernie will think I'm totally insane,"" she said, laughing. ""So I hope they take the time to learn more about my whole story, and the reason I want to do it."" In the meantime, Ms. Smartelli said, she will continue to dream of actually walking Bernie down the aisle, with Spinner as best man, and celebrating with virtual family and friends. But no matter how the reality of her Valentine's Day unfolds, Ms. Smartelli will ultimately find the true meaning of the day in the company of Bernie and Spinner, just as others who do not necessarily mark Feb. 14 as a romantic holiday on their calendars might instead choose to spend the day in the company of a good book, or by watching a sunrise, or visiting loved ones at a cemetery. ""It's kind of ironic, but Bernie and Spinner, who are just a couple of rescue dogs, have actually rescued me from a life of loneliness,"" said Ms. Smartelli, who began to cry. ""I really love those two guys,"" she said. ""It wouldn't be Valentine's Day without them.""","Lilly Smartelli always wanted a ""big Italian wedding.""

Economy,Illinois Wields New Power to Challenge Noncompete Agreements,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/business/economy/illinois-noncompete.html,"A Check Into Cash location in Chicago. The company's noncompete agreement applies to any similar business within 15 miles of one of its stores.

The clerks at Check Into Cash, a national chain that offers check cashing and payday loans, are paid close to minimum wage to do tasks like enter customers' information into a computer. The job does not require much training. Some employees lack a high school diploma. Nevertheless, many must sign a contract that prohibits them from working at competing companies. Legislation to restrict or ban these so-called noncompete agreements has been enacted in several states, but the contracts remain widespread even among low-wage workers. Attorneys general are also now getting involved, adding legal muscle to the political and economic debate. On Wednesday, the Illinois attorney general sued Check Into Cash, accusing the company of violating a state law prohibiting noncompete agreements for workers making less than $13 an hour. The lawsuit, the first since the law was passed last year, demands that the company remove the clause. Check Into Cash has about 250 employees in Illinois and about 3,000 nationwide. ""I want to ensure that Illinois workers have the freedom to change jobs and seek better wages,"" said the Illinois attorney general, Lisa Madigan, a Democrat. ""And what we have found is that the use of unfair noncompete agreements have scared a lot of low-income workers into staying in low-paying jobs when they could, based on their experience, get better pay.""

Check Into Cash did not return several calls seeking comment. Companies have used noncompete agreements for decades, but employment lawyers say that until fairly recently they were limited to executives and professionals like research scientists and engineers. Today they extend up and down the wage ladder: About one in five employees was bound by a noncompete clause in 2014, according to a survey by economists including Evan Starr, a management professor at the University of Maryland. When workers violate one of these agreements, courts can prevent them from taking a new position or remove them from a job they've settled into. Even when that does not happen, the threat creates a chilling effect that makes people skittish about leaving or seeking a raise. Volumes of economic research have identified the proliferation of these agreements as one reason American wages have been stagnant. This has led to a push from state and national politicians to limit where and how they can be used. Last year, the Treasury Department and President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers released papers on the economic harm wrought by noncompetes and other restrictive employment contracts. In 2015, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, introduced federal legislation to ban noncompetes for workers making less than $15 an hour. The bill never passed, but last year the Illinois legislature passed a law prohibiting noncompetes for employees who make less than $13 an hour. Since then the attorney general has reached settlements with several companies to have the clauses removed, but until Wednesday had not filed a lawsuit.

In addition to alleging that Check Into Cash broke Illinois's new noncompete law, the suit takes a page from the economic literature by arguing that noncompetes hurt the state's economy by suppressing wages and preventing workers from leaving for better pay. It also argues that noncompetes make it harder for state employers to find the best people, reducing innovation and limiting the pool of workers that thriving businesses need to grow.

* Stocks rise after President Biden says Jerome Powell will stay atop the Fed. ""It's clearly a winning issue for attorneys general,"" said Alan B. Krueger, a Princeton economics professor who was chairman of Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. In Illinois and elsewhere, much of the recent interest among legislators and attorneys general began a little over three years ago, when the Huffington Post reported that the Jimmy John's sandwich chain required hourly sandwich makers and delivery drivers to sign noncompetes. Illinois sued Jimmy John's last year, arguing that its noncompete agreement violated the state's consumer fraud act -- the new noncompete law hadn't been passed yet -- and reached a settlement in which the company agreed to remove the clause. Each time the Jimmy John's case was in the news, the Illinois attorney general's office received a round of calls from workers who felt they had signed an unfair noncompete agreement, including nurses, sales representatives, day care workers and cooks. One complaint came from an undisclosed employee of Check Into Cash. Ms. Madigan said her office was investigating about a dozen companies over the use of noncompete agreements. According to the lawsuit, clerks at Illinois branches of Check Into Cash agree not to work at any employer offering services like check cashing, loans or money transmission for a year after they leave. It applies to employers within 15 miles of any of the company's more than 1,000 locations in the United States. The Illinois attorney general's lawsuit said that because Check Into Cash had 33 locations in the state, its workers were effectively agreeing not to seek employment at competitors across Chicago and its suburbs.",The first lawsuit brought under a recently passed law seeks to overturn provisions keeping a payday lender's employees from working for rivals.,a8ea6040-119b-5b77-ba40-e4dcdefc6797,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/26/business/26NONCOMPETEjmp2/26NONCOMPETE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=d167ea0ffd4e9531483f9249badcecb3e024d6b5c4b065ca63ca64b17c98e936&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A Check Into Cash location in Chicago.

Dance,"Sara Mearns, an Explorer Way Beyond Ballet",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/09/arts/dance/sara-mearns-jacobs-pillow.html,"Earlier this summer, Sara Mearns came to a shocking realization: She hadn't worn a pair of point shoes in four and a half weeks. For a ballerina, a point shoe is a second skin. ""I wasn't even thinking about it, because I was dancing,"" Ms. Mearns said. ""Someone joked with me and said, 'You become a modern dancer on your layoffs.'"" Ms. Mearns, a principal with New York City Ballet, sprawled out on a floor in a downtown studio after a recent rehearsal for yet another new project -- a dance in sneakers -- and laughed. ""I do,"" she said. ""I never think twice about, 'oh, God, I'm not doing ballet.' It's always about the people I'm working with and the project.""

To find another ballet dancer who expanded his or her range with such fortitude and ferocity, you'd have to go back to Mikhail Baryshnikov. But he transitioned into modern dance after his ballet career ended. Ms. Mearns is still going strong as a classical dancer. Beginning Wednesday, she will show off her contemporary side in ""Beyond Ballet,"" a program presented by Jacob's Pillow, that includes ""Opulence,"" a new duet by Jodi Melnick; ""No. 1,"" a duet with Honji Wang of the French hip-hop duo Wang Ramirez; and ""Ekstasis,"" a 1933 solo by Martha Graham, reimagined by Virginie Mecene, the former Graham company principal. For Pamela Tatge, the Pillow's director, Ms. Mearns is ""a rare dancer,"" one who is ""able to realize any movement that a choreographer -- as far as I've seen -- puts in front of her."" It's getting to the point where Ms. Mearns could have her own branch on the modern dance tree. So far, her repertory has included dances by modern masters like Graham, Isadora Duncan and Merce Cunningham, and contemporary choreographers including Jodi Melnick, Pam Tanowitz and Christopher Williams.

""Every time I say yes,"" Ms. Mearns said, ""I'm like, I don't know if I can do this, but I'm not going to say no. I'm not going to say no to Cunningham. I'm not going to say no to Martha Graham. I'm just going to try and do my best."" As a classical dancer, Ms. Mearns has a power and command that few share; in modern works, she is more contained, but still glitteringly present. The only thing that seems to scare her is the possibility of not trying hard enough. For ""Night of 100 Solos: A Centennial Event,"" which celebrated the centenary of Merce Cunningham, Ms. Mearns shared the stage with accomplished contemporary dancers. From the start, she was remarkable in material that is almost impossible to master -- her fearlessness and precision shifted the mood: Suddenly, the stage was a place of a heightened, incandescent alertness. After performing her third solo, Ms. Mearns went into the hallway and cried. (She isn't the type to hide her emotions on or off the stage.) ""It was out of pure joy,"" she said. ""I put everything I could into it and I took chances, and I couldn't believe it when I came off. I haven't had that feeling in a very long time.""

As she looks beyond ballet, Ms. Mearns's artistic path is more internal, more personal. ""It's not a P.R. thing, it's not a way to get attention. It's, 'What is a collaboration that no one has done before?' It doesn't have to be commercial and it doesn't have to make money for it to be successful."" She would rather unleash her creativity with choreographers like Ms. Melnick, who inspired Ms. Mearns to expand her dance horizons in the first place. (They met at Danspace Project in a 2015 platform that paired contemporary dance artists and those with backgrounds with Cunningham and City Ballet.) Ms. Melnick comes out of postmodern dance and has worked with artists including Twyla Tharp, Trisha Brown, Sara Rudner and Mr. Baryshnikov. Her finely wrought movement is a chain of complex articulations and shifts of weight that have an effortless way of peeling or slipping silkily off the body. Ms. Melnick's sophisticated choreography is neither flashy nor full of the indistinguishable posturing often found in contemporary ballet, and Ms. Mearns is obsessed with it. But it's not just the dancing: Through her exposure to Ms. Melnick, Ms. Mearns's taste has become more refined .

After they collaborated on ""Working in Process/New Bodies"" for Works and & Process at the Guggenheim, Ms. Mearns asked Ms. Melnick to choreograph a duet for the two of them. ""She was very adamant and serious about dancing with me,"" Ms. Melnick said. Though she prefers to work alone at the start of any process -- ""that loneliness factor is really important to me,"" Ms. Melnick said -- Ms. Mearns wore her down, and she had a partner in the studio last fall. As they worked together, Ms. Mearns would follow along behind Ms. Melnick. ""When something happened that I felt was of interest to her or to me, I would stop and teach it to her,"" Ms. Melnick said. ""It kind of reminded me of processes that I've been in with other choreographers where you don't question or judge."" But in late December, Ms. Melnick was involved in a motorcycle accident; her ankle was severely damaged. She didn't start walking again until the end of March and remains in considerable pain. ""I was like, O.K.,"" Ms. Melnick said. ""Kind of like, game over, and then after talking to my surgeons and Sara -- she was like, 'Don't make a decision, let's just get back into the studio and see what happens.' If it wasn't for her, I'd probably still be not dancing or not even doing this well in my recovery."" For the duet, ""Opulence,"" they will perform in sneakers; Ms. Melnick is exploring how seemingly simple movement can have many facets. ""There's something that feels very opulent in cutting things down and keeping it very minimal,"" she said.

Ms. Mearns loves challenges, and Ms. Melnick's work is full of them. ""She's helped me be more in tune in my own body and to not just move through things and throw things away -- because she never does that ever,"" Ms. Mearns said. ""It helps me move better in ballet. After doing all of this, I feel like I am feeling things differently and improving as I'm getting older."" And they have become friends. ""Half of our rehearsals are therapy sessions and then we dance at the end,"" Ms. Mearns said. And Ms. Melnick's influence expands beyond her own work. Now, in both her work at City Ballet and beyond, Ms. Mearns can grasp the allure and power of simplicity. She also relishes the ability to stay open, which, for her, is what any ballerina should be in the modern age. But what is not on her list at all? Broadway -- though she starred last spring in the Encores! production of ""I Married an Angel,"" which was choreographed and directed by her husband, Joshua Bergasse, who works in musical theater. That was a labor of love and, it turned out, an important step in her artistic development: She learned that she can speak onstage, and that she has comic timing. ""When you hear that laugh, you're just like, that's good,"" she said, her deep voice lowering another octave for emphasis. ""That is good."" But the politics and the commercial aspect of the Broadway world trouble her. ""It's not successful unless you make money, unless your investors are happy and unless you get a laugh out of the audience,"" she said. ""That, for me, is not fulfilling. But my husband loves it, and that's what he grew up on. And also he likes to make good theater. He doesn't just want to do huge moneymakers. Right now that is really hard because everything is just taking movies and making them into musicals.""

In the coming months, she will perform a new duet by Kim Brandstrup alongside her City Ballet colleague Taylor Stanley at the Fall for Dance Festival and work with Ms. Melnick and the filmmaker Charles Atlas as part of a residency at Baryshnikov Arts Center. There's more; she just can't talk about it yet. But she did bring up an ultimate dream: to work with Mr. Baryshnikov. ""I don't even know how that would happen or how that would work,"" she said. ""We chat and we talk, but I don't even know what it would be."" She paused and a panicked expression washed over her face: ""How do I make that happen?"" Ms. Mearns will stay open. She will remain patient. And then when the moment comes, she will seize it.","Trading her point shoes for sneakers and bare feet, Ms. Mearns has added modern and contemporary dance to her repertory.",17c89edb-1c2e-5faf-ab3b-4b5430af4410,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/11/arts/11SARAMEARNS-1/11SARAMEARNS-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=9b8d6c57e692f2880fad65af067c6cc6f73331e76ca19c688c406af0d8c6c65e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Sara Mearns of New York City Ballet.,17c89edb-1c2e-5faf-ab3b-4b5430af4410,N24News/imgs/17c89edb-1c2e-5faf-ab3b-4b5430af4410.jpg,6
Media,The Many Times Megyn Kelly Became the Story,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/business/media/controversies-megyn-kelly.html,"That's an adage in the news business that most journalists try to live by, even in a time that rewards self-promotion. And it's a rule that Megyn Kelly flouted again and again. While this tendency was not much of a factor in her previous job, as a prime-time anchor at Fox News, it created complications during her 18-month stint at NBC. The network canceled her show, ""Megyn Kelly Today,"" days after she suggested on air that dressing up in blackface for Halloween was appropriate for white people. Ms. Kelly's comments, and the uproar that followed, felt familiar to many fans and critics. [NBC and Megyn Kelly part ways with the full $69 million from her contract.] Those who become stars at major broadcast networks have a rare talent for being interesting and innocuous at the same time. Ms. Kelly, a former corporate lawyer who made her name as a sometimes confrontational interviewer, struggled to walk that line.

Here is a look at the times Ms. Kelly became the story. Weighing In on Santa and Jesus On her Fox News show, ""The Kelly File,"" Ms. Kelly took issue with an essay in Slate arguing that the popular image of Santa Claus as a white man was due for a makeover. ""For all of you kids watching at home, Santa just is white,"" Ms. Kelly said. Later in the discussion, she added, ""Jesus was a white man, too."" In the panel discussion that followed, she did not acknowledge research that traces St. Nicholas to a fourth-century bishop in what is now Turkey and scholarship that has long debated what Jesus actually looked like. Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, who hosted shows on Comedy Central at the time, led the rhetorical charge against Ms. Kelly's remarks. ""You do know Jesus wasn't born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, right?"" Mr. Stewart said. Ms. Kelly's feud with Donald J. Trump -- which broadened her appeal beyond her Fox News base -- began in Cleveland during the first Republican presidential debate in August 2015. Before a prime-time audience, Ms. Kelly questioned the candidate about his history of denigrating women as pigs, dogs and ""slobs.""

After the event, Mr. Trump added Ms. Kelly to his list of Twitter targets, saying she ""really bombed"" as a moderator. He also told an interviewer that, during the debate, Ms. Kelly had ""blood coming out of her wherever"" -- a comment widely interpreted as a reference to menstruation. Mr. Trump refused to participate in a later debate that Ms. Kelly moderated in Iowa. The attention raised her profile but also made her the target of death threats, she later wrote in her memoir. Fox News stood by its host, issuing a statement that Mr. Trump had an ""extreme, sick obsession"" with her. After months of Mr. Trump calling Ms. Kelly ""crazy,"" ""overrated"" and ""sick,"" Roger E. Ailes, then the chairman of Fox News, tried to broker a truce between his star and the candidate at Trump Tower. Weeks later, Ms. Kelly sat down to interview the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. But the tough questions went missing. Critics described the tone of the interview -- part of a Fox News prime-time special that aired in May 2016 -- as ""crushed velvet"" and ""neither groundbreaking nor especially informative."" After the interview, Mr. Trump posted a supportive message on Twitter: ""Well done Megyn -- and they all lived happily ever after!""

The third guest for ""Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly"" was Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist who founded Infowars. Before the episode aired, families of children and teachers killed in the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. -- which Mr. Jones has called a hoax -- pleaded with NBC not to give him publicity, especially in a segment scheduled for Father's Day. Before the interview, critics accused Ms. Kelly of being too cozy with Mr. Jones, especially after Infowars published audio of her cajoling and flattering him to do the interview by saying she did not want to portray him ""as some boogeyman."" Mr. Jones also released a photo from the day of the interview that showed him and Ms. Kelly in a car. In the picture, she was smiling and wearing sunglasses. Parents of children killed in the Sandy Hook shooting asked NBC to spike the interview, and a Connecticut affiliate announced that it would not air the program. Ms. Kelly was also disinvited from a Sandy Hook charity event and accused by some viewers of infecting NBC with Fox News-style conservatism. Face to face with Mr. Jones, Ms. Kelly challenged him repeatedly and described his claims as ""reckless accusation, followed by equivocations and excuses."" But by then the public relations battle had been lost.

With her Sunday night troubles behind her, it was time for the unveiling of Ms. Kelly as the host of ""Megyn Kelly Today."" Her challenge? Prove to audiences -- and the NBC executives who had given her a three-year, $69 million contract -- that she could make herself at home in the bubbly environs of morning television. Her first guests were the creators and cast of the rebooted NBC sitcom ""Will & Grace."" Debra Messing, a star of the show, seemed enthusiastic about promoting the return of the groundbreaking comedy -- which broke taboos about the portrayal of gay characters in mainstream entertainment in the late 1990s. During the segment Ms. Kelly called out to a ""Will & Grace"" superfan who happened to be in the audience, inviting him to the stage of Studio 6A. The audience applauded as the beaming man received hugs from the sitcom's stars. And then came Ms. Kelly's question: ""Is it true that you became a lawyer, and you became gay, because of Will?"" The suggestion that sexual orientation is a choice prompted many of Ms. Messing's fans to criticize her participation on Ms. Kelly's program, and the actress said on Instagram that her appearance with the show had been a mistake. ""Regret going on,"" Ms. Messing wrote. "" Dismayed by her comments ."" And despite a big promotional push, the show's first week drew lackluster ratings.

When Ms. Kelly was in law school, she found herself gaining weight. Eager to slim down, she asked her stepfather to shame her whenever she went into the kitchen. ""And it works,"" she said with a thumbs-up gesture during a segment about a mother who posted photos of the svelte physique she was able to maintain while raising three young children . ""What's your excuse?"" the mother added in a caption. Ms. Kelly went all in on the shaming regimen during her interview of the mother. ""You should parlay the shaming thing into a professional business,"" the host said. ""Because some of us want to be shamed!"" The comments did not go over well, with Meghan McCain noting on Twitter that fat shaming has ""real-life ramifications."" ""I still cringe when I hear a person attacked for his or her weight,"" Ms. Kelly said on her show the next day. ""Please know I would never encourage that toward any person. I've been thinking a lot about why I once encouraged it toward myself.""",Her remarks on blackface costumes back in October did not shock those who recalled her statements on the whiteness of Santa Claus and Jesus. And her encounters with certain high-profile guests didn't help her standing at NBC.,6271aa73-7510-5696-a42b-be6a69ff456a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/02/business/00megynkelly-top/merlin_127707038_54ea929f-88f3-4d77-985e-23d336eb53e2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=2416e2ad2e9f07801af57f2b41d1c8c7e3e03eae9bef8169cbb05cc820bfdfb6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Megyn Kelly, on the set of her NBC show, which was canceled in October.",6271aa73-7510-5696-a42b-be6a69ff456a,N24News/imgs/6271aa73-7510-5696-a42b-be6a69ff456a.jpg,16
Media,New York Times Reassigns Reporter in Leak Case,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/business/media/ali-watkins-times-reporter-memo.html,"Ali Watkins, the New York Times reporter whose email and phone records were secretly seized by the Trump administration, will be transferred out of the newspaper's Washington bureau and reassigned to a new beat in New York, The Times said on Tuesday. Ms. Watkins, 26, had been the subject of an internal review by The Times after revelations that she had a three-year affair with a high-ranking aide on the Senate Intelligence Committee, which she covered for several news organizations before joining The Times in December. The aide, James Wolfe, 57, who handled classified material for the committee, was arrested last month as part of a leak investigation in which the Justice Department also seized Ms. Watkins's communications, an unusually aggressive move against a journalist that prompted an outcry from press advocates. Mr. Wolfe was charged with lying to the F.B.I. but not with leaking classified information; he has pleaded not guilty. [Read more about how Ms. Watkins's relationship with Mr. Wolfe rattled the world of Washington journalists.]

Ms. Watkins, who had been covering federal law enforcement at The Times, will be assigned a mentor and moved to a new beat in New York ""for a fresh start,"" the paper's executive editor, Dean Baquet, wrote in a memo to the newsroom. ""We hold our journalists and their work to the highest standards,"" Mr. Baquet wrote. ""We are giving Ali an opportunity to show that she can live up to them. I believe she can."" He added: ""I also believe that The Times must be a humane place that can allow for second chances when there are mitigating circumstances."" In a statement on Tuesday, Ms. Watkins wrote: ""I respect and understand the Times's review and agree that I should have handled aspects of my past relationships and disclosures differently. I sincerely regret putting The Times in a difficult position and am very grateful for the support I've received from my editors and colleagues here. I also appreciate the review's conclusion that my reporting has been fact-based and accurate."" The story of Ms. Watkins's affair rattled Washington journalists and raised questions about prosecutorial overreach and journalistic ethics. In his 575-word memo, Mr. Baquet acknowledged the complexity and sensitivity of Ms. Watkins's situation. ""As an institution, we abhor the actions of the government in this case,"" he wrote, calling the Justice Department's seizure of her records ""an attempt to interfere with the work of journalists by an administration whose leader has called the media 'the enemy of the people.'"" Other Times journalists have noticed sources ""clamming up because of this assault of on how we do our jobs,"" he wrote.

But, Mr. Baquet added, ""We are troubled by Ali's conduct, particularly while she was employed by other news organizations. For a reporter to have an intimate relationship with someone he or she covers is unacceptable.""
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Ms. Watkins, who has not written for The Times since Mr. Wolfe's arrest, was notified in February by the Justice Department that her email and phone records had been seized. On the advice of her personal lawyer, she did not inform her editors in The Times's Washington bureau, and only revealed the information last month when her colleagues were about to report on Mr. Wolfe's arrest. Mr. Baquet wrote that those actions ""put our news organization in a difficult position."" The government's pursuit of Ms. Watkins -- who at one point was confronted in a bar by a Customs and Border Protection officer, who seemed to have gained access to her private travel records -- has outraged press advocates. But journalists were also unsettled by her violation of a bedrock norm of their profession: avoiding romantic involvement with a person she covered. Reporters at The Times, and at other news organizations, have expressed unease over Ms. Watkins's conduct. Women in particular say the episode has made them more vulnerable to an ugly and false stereotype often lobbed at female reporters, that they exchange sex for information. Ms. Watkins met Mr. Wolfe while reporting on the intelligence committee as a 22-year-old intern at McClatchy Newspapers, where her coverage led to a series of stories named a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize. She has said the relationship did not turn romantic until after those stories ran.

Theater,Review: Putting Outlaw Music on Trial in 'Rock and Roll Man',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/theater/review-rock-and-roll-man.html,"A courtroom scene in ""Rock and Roll Man"": Little Richard (Richard Crandle), center, is defense counsel for the disc jockey Alan Freed (Alan Campbell, left) while J. Edgar Hoover (George Wendt, right) prosecutes and Judge Mental (Brian Mathis) presides.



PITTSFIELD, Mass. -- You have to give points for chutzpah to a musical that imagines Little Richard and J. Edgar Hoover as adversaries in a celestial courtroom. The fabled singer of ""Tutti Frutti"" and ""Good Golly, Miss Molly"" -- portrayed with shiny self-delight and lip gloss to match by Richard Crandle -- serves as defense counsel for the title character of ""Rock and Roll Man: The Alan Freed Story,"" which opened on Saturday at the Colonial Theater here. Hoover, the infamous longtime head of the F.B.I., is the prosecuting attorney, naturally , and is played as a monolith of sternness (and minimal expressiveness) by George Wendt (of ""Cheers"" immortality). This ill-matched pair shows up to do battle over the fate of Freed (Alan Campbell), the influential disc jockey credited with giving rock 'n' roll its name, in a nightmare-generated forum called the Court of Public Opinion. A sequin-robed eminence known as Judge Mental (Brian Mathis) presides.

Sounds like a hoot, right? I'll admit my hopes were raised when this fantasy courtroom first materialized, amid tantalizing Expressionist distortions, courtesy of Tim Mackabee (sets) and Matthew Richards (lighting). Just imagine the crazy secrets that might come tumbling out if either of these antithetical men even scratched the other's surface. No such luck with this Berkshire Theater Group production, which features a by-the-numbers book by Gary Kupper, Larry Marshak and Rose Caiola, with original songs by Mr. Kupper. After all, this is a jukebox musical, and the evidence presented to the jury (us, the audience) takes the form of snippets of dozens of pop hits that Freed introduced to mainstream audiences. Since those songs include pioneering works that have aged into golden oldies now tattooed upon the national memory -- and since the audience is encouraged to clap along as they are performed, you can probably predict what the verdict will be. Hoover doesn't stand a chance. That's especially true once you realize that these numbers will be presented with a consistent, easy-listening affability that makes you wonder how such music could ever have been considered dangerous. And as played with choir boy sweetness by Mr. Campbell, Freed -- who was convicted of accepting payola toward the end of his meteoric career -- registers throughout as definitely more sinned against than sinning. Conveying the sweaty, sexy excitement of early rock, and its transgressive blurring of racial lines, has always been a problem for Broadway-style musicals, whether the source material is Leiber and Stoller (""Smokey Joe's Cafe,"" on Broadway in 1995), Elvis (""All Shook Up,"" 2005) or a John Waters movie (""Cry-Baby,"" 2008). Rough edges and quirky personalities tend to be sanded down to the same monotonous smoothness.

The performers being impersonated in ""Rock and Roll Man,"" which is directed by Randal Myler and choreographed by Brian Reeder, include Chuck Berry and Screamin' Jay Hawkins (both embodied by Matthew S. Morgan), Buddy Holly (John Dewey), Jerry Lee Lewis (James Scheider), Frankie Lymon (William Louis Bailey) and LaVern Baker (Valisia Lekae). Also in residence is a very harmonious quartet, made up of Early Clover, A.J. Davis, Jerome Jackson and Eric B. Turner. They're perfectly genial company, of the type you might encounter in a theme park pavilion. But only Ms. Lekae and Mr. Crandle start to convey the disruptive electricity of these recording stars. When you're told that Freed's oversold concerts led to riots -- and were really and truly banned in Boston -- you may feel like scratching your head.

There's no denying the immense cultural influence of Freed, who died at 43 in 1965 and was one of the original inductees into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. He was a clean-cut, ostensibly easygoing fellow who might have passed for an insurance agent or a knowing father from a 1950s sitcom. That such a white-bread guy should have felt a bone-deep affinity for what was perceived as subversive music, and facilitated its transition into the mainstream, is a paradox worth pondering. Earlier representations of Freed in movies (""American Hot Wax,"" 1978) and television (""Mr. Rock 'n' Roll: The Alan Freed Story,"" 1999) failed, however, to make him a compelling figure. Mr. Campbell, a Tony nominee as Joe the gigolo screenwriter in the original Broadway production of ""Sunset Boulevard,"" doesn't add much to the portrait. He sings angelically (including original, hazy songs in the '50s vernacular by Mr. Kupper), smiles seraphically and projects inner conflict by furtively swigging from a flask. If only Freed's inner demons had occasionally been let out to play. If only his perky teenage fans were shown acting in ways that really might have frightened their parents. Alas, such messy behavior is rarely acceptable in the land of the jukebox musical, where rules are as rigidly obeyed as they were in the Eisenhower era.",A by-the-numbers jukebox musical weighs the evidence for and against the groundbreaking '50s disc jockey Alan Freed.,d0b0c031-51f4-5b36-9bef-f22c0218bc6b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/10/arts/10rockandroll/10rockandroll-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=81393993f2cd00990318de0d8c9ed8f850a206d4d076482839cc7a272f66d3bc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A courtroom scene in ""Rock and Roll Man"":  Little Richard (Richard Crandle), center, is defense counsel for the disc jockey Alan Freed (Alan Campbell, left) while J.

Movies,'The Last Full Measure' Review: Remembering a Fallen War Hero,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/movies/the-last-full-measure-review.html,"When in a movie a harried, cynical, pencil-pushing government bureaucrat is saddled with an assignment he doesn't want, during a crisis in his employment, you know how it's going to go.

Opinion,Crumbs for the Hungry but Windfalls for the Rich,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/23/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-economic-response.html,"While President Trump and his allies in Congress seek to tighten access to food stamps, they are showing compassion for one group: zillionaires. Their economic rescue package quietly allocated $135 billion -- yes, that's ""billion"" with a ""b"" -- for the likes of wealthy real estate developers. My Times colleague Jesse Drucker notes that Trump himself, along with his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, may benefit financially from this provision. The fine print was mysteriously slipped into the March economic relief package, even though it has nothing to do with the coronavirus and offers retroactive tax breaks for periods long before Covid-19 arrived. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas, both Democrats, have asked the Trump administration for any communications that illuminate how this provision sneaked into the 880-page bill. (Officially, the provision is called ""Modification of Limitation on Losses for Taxpayers Other Than Corporations,"" but that's camouflage; I prefer to call it the ""Zillionaire Giveaway."") About 82 percent of the Zillionaire Giveaway goes to those earning more than $1 million a year, according to Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation. Of those beneficiaries earning more than $1 million annually, the average benefit is $1.6 million.

In other words, a single mom juggling two jobs gets a maximum $1,200 stimulus check -- and then pays taxes so that a real estate mogul can receive $1.6 million. This is dog-eat-dog capitalism for struggling workers, and socialism for the rich. Many Americans understand that Trump bungled the public health response to the coronavirus, but polls suggest that they don't appreciate the degree to which Trump and Congress also bungled the economic response -- or manipulated it to benefit those who least need help. The United States simply accepted that the pandemic would cause vast numbers of workers to be laid off -- and then it provided unemployment benefits. But Germany, France, Britain, Denmark and other countries took the smarter path of paying companies to keep workers on their payrolls, thus preventing layoffs in the first place. The United States did a little bit of this, but far less than Europe -- yet the United States in some cases spent a larger share of G.D.P. on the bailout than Europe did. So the unemployment rate in Germany and Denmark is forecast to reach about 5 percent while in the United States it may already be about 20 percent, depending on how you count it.

It's not fair to viruses to blame our unemployment crisis simply on the pandemic. It's also our national choice. At the same time, it has become increasingly clear that money intended to rescue small businesses has often gone not to those with the greatest need but rather to those with the most shameless lawyers. They are part of our national equation: Power creates money creates more power creates more money. One provision in the rescue package provides a tax break that benefits only companies with more than $25 million in gross receipts. AutoNation, a Fortune 500 company, received $77 million in small business funds, although it returned the sum after The Washington Post reported its haul. For-profit colleges, which are better known for exploiting students than educating them, have raked in $1.1 billion. A Brookings Institution study found that young children in one in six American households are not getting enough to eat because of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and we're rushing to help ... tycoons! A Kaiser Family Foundation study found that because of layoffs, 27 million Americans as of May 2 were at risk of losing employer-sponsored health insurance. You might think that this would lead to a push for universal health coverage. But, no, the opposite: Trump is continuing to support a lawsuit to overturn the entire Affordable Care Act -- and allow millions more to lose coverage. During the Great Depression, President Franklin Roosevelt responded boldly to economic desperation by creating jobs, passing Social Security and starting rural electrification. In this crisis, Trump is trying to restrict food stamps and health insurance while giving free money to real estate tycoons -- probably including himself. Of course, America does remain a land of opportunity, if you have the wealth. A new study determined that in the two months since March 18, roughly the start of the economic crisis, America's billionaires saw their wealth collectively grow by 15 percent. And another 16 Americans became billionaires in that period. It's great to see people pulling themselves up by their bootstraps!",Billions are going to zillionaires under the guise of pandemic relief.,76cd7bd8-8deb-50b3-b3fe-55c49d0acd08,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/opinion/24Kristof/24Kristof-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=f5ab5052290e09440404357156533a89016b8a56bf771f1cdec506eae9a8d6e8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A line to receive application forms for unemployment benefits in Hialeah, Fla., last month.",76cd7bd8-8deb-50b3-b3fe-55c49d0acd08,N24News/imgs/76cd7bd8-8deb-50b3-b3fe-55c49d0acd08.jpg,11
Technology,Google's Sensorvault Is a Boon for Law Enforcement. This Is How It Works.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/13/technology/google-sensorvault-location-tracking.html,"Google's Sensorvault Is a Boon for Law Enforcement. This Is How It Works. 
* None   John Taggart for The New York Times

Law enforcement officials across the country have been seeking information from a Google database called Sensorvault -- a trove of detailed location records involving at least hundreds of millions of devices worldwide, The New York Times found. Though the new technique can identify suspects near crimes, it runs the risk of sweeping up innocent bystanders, highlighting the impact that companies' mass collection of data can have on people's lives. Why does Google have this data? The Sensorvault database is connected to a Google service called Location History. The feature, begun in 2009, involves Android and Apple devices. Location History is not on by default. Google prompts users to enable it when they are setting up certain services -- traffic alerts in Google Maps, for example, or group images tied to location in Google Photos. If you have Location History turned on, Google will collect your data as long as you are signed in to your account and have location-enabled Google apps on your phone. The company can collect the data even when you are not using your apps, if your phone settings allow that. Google says it uses the data to target ads and measure how effective they are -- checking, for instance, when people go into an advertiser's store. The company also uses the information in an aggregated, anonymized form to figure out when stores are busy and to provide traffic estimates. And those who enable Location History can see a timeline of their activities and get recommendations based on where they have been. Google says it does not sell or share the data with advertisers or other companies. Does Google collect other forms of location data? Yes. Google can also gather location information when you conduct searches or use Google apps that have location enabled. If you are signed in, this data is associated with your account. The Associated Press reported last year that this data, called Web & App Activity, is collected even if you do not have Location History turned on. It is kept in a different database from Sensorvault, Google says. How can I see what data Google has on me? To see some of the information in your Location History, you can look at your timeline. This map of your travels does not include all of your Sensorvault data, however. Raw location data from mobile devices can be messy and sometimes incorrect. But computers can make good guesses about your likely path, and about which locations are most important. This is what you see on your timeline. To review all of your Location History, you can download your data from Google. To do that, go to Takeout.Google.com and select Location History. You can follow a similar procedure to download your Web & App Activity on that page. Your Location History data will appear in computer code. If you can't read code, you can select the ""JSON"" format and put the file into a text editor to see what it looks like. Yes. The process varies depending on whether you are on a phone or computer. In its Help Center , Google provides instructions on disabling or deleting Location History and Web & App Activity. How is law enforcement using the data? For years, police detectives have given Google warrants seeking location data tied to specific users' accounts. But the new warrants, often called ""geofence"" requests, instead specify an area near a crime. Google looks in Sensorvault for any devices that were there at the right time and provides that information to the police. Google first labels the devices with anonymous ID numbers, and detectives look at locations and movement patterns to see if any appear relevant to the crime. Once they narrow the field to a few devices, Google reveals information such as names and email addresses.",Investigators have been tapping into the tech giant's enormous cache of location information in an effort to solve crimes. Here's what this database is and what it does.,a9038d3b-1e38-5984-9dac-18270b4a8a79,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/12/obituaries/archives/00sensorvault/merlin_146186067_711ae12c-5930-47dd-8b4a-429e5b9ba8c9-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=5d4f80fb4b6a8647db09405e598b26ff0d840f94046bfe42d160d9638c22f0a9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The headquarters of Google in Manhattan.,a9038d3b-1e38-5984-9dac-18270b4a8a79,N24News/imgs/a9038d3b-1e38-5984-9dac-18270b4a8a79.jpg,20
Books,Emma Cline Knows First World Problems,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/01/books/review/emma-cline-daddy.html,"In an era whose ascendant short-story practitioners lean into high-concept experiments of genre and form, Emma Cline represents something of a throwback. The 10 stories that constitute her first collection, ""Daddy"" (following her much-raved-about 2016 debut novel, ""The Girls""), are almost classical in structure -- you won't find a fragmentary collage, list or screenplay among them. Though she's not one for a sudden, curious departure of voice or dissolution of the fourth wall, Cline has an unnerving narrative proprioception, and her stories have the clean, bright lines of modernist architecture.

As for her style, she seems to eschew the telegraphic mode made popular by writers like Sally Rooney or Rachel Cusk for something at once direct and musical. Cline's idiom is earnestness punctuated by millennial cool -- but nothing too fussy, everything in just the right place. At the start of ""Son of Friedman,"" she writes: ""The light in the restaurant was golden light, heavy light -- an outdated sort of light, honestly, popular in the '90s but now a remnant of a kind of gaudy, old-school pleasure it was no longer fashionable to enjoy.""

There's a riffing playfulness to her prose as it turns back on itself to interrupt, comment or elaborate. This self-aware tone appears here or there in the collection, cluing us in that the author, or at least the narrating intelligence, knows something these characters do not, covering the stories in a patina of wisdom or insight. In ""Los Angeles,"" a story about a young woman who works at a clothing store and takes acting classes, we get lines like: ""They sold cheap, slutty clothes in primary colors, clothes invoking a low-level athleticism -- tube socks, track shorts -- as if sex was an alternative sport,"" and ""Before they put the clothes on the racks, they had to steam them, trying to reanimate the sheen of value."" There's also the killer first line of ""Mack the Knife,"" about a depressed man in early middle life trying to find his way back to some semblance of order in New York: ""He had been sad, clinically so, but over all things had improved.""

All of the stories are narrated in a close third person, told from the perspectives of both men and women. The primary axis of tension is, interestingly enough, not so much between genders as between generations. Cline preserves the usual hierarchy: the weary young, the flummoxed and resentful old, everyone tumbling around feeling constrained. The first story, ""What Can You Do With a General,"" follows John as he tries and fails to reconnect with his adult children during a holiday visit, his baffled disgust clearly visible. During a scene that finds John revisiting old home movies, Cline observes, ""How easily a veil dropped between him and this group of people who were his family. They fuzzed out, pleasantly, became vague enough that he could love them."" In ""The Nanny,"" 24-year-old Kayla has taken refuge with a family friend, Mary, to hide from a tabloid scandal involving her affair with a famous actor. Cline nails Kayla's withering deadpan: ""Mary, with her loose linen shirts, her silver oxfords, was the kind of older woman that younger girls were always saying they wanted to be like. ... Kayla understood that Mary was a nice person without really believing it; Mary irritated her."" In ""Northeast Regional,"" a surly father takes the train to collect his son from boarding school after he's been involved in an alluded-to but unnamed ""incident.""","The stories in ""Daddy,"" the debut collection by the author of ""The Girls,"" follow the ""trials"" of the Hollywood and literary elite.",bdf315c6-0914-5169-8201-3f57a7a20199,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/20/books/review/20taylor-sub/20taylor-sub-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=7761cef1cc0640905afaa4e5eddfce2ea9dc0d0ca03507974641fcc8376b175a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Emma Cline's idiom is earnestness punctuated by millennial cool — but nothing too fussy, everything in just the right place.",bdf315c6-0914-5169-8201-3f57a7a20199,N24News/imgs/bdf315c6-0914-5169-8201-3f57a7a20199.jpg,13
Travel,"In My Los Angeles, Hollywood Was a Thousand Miles Away",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/travel/los-angeles-travel-local.html,"Los Angeles is defined by the people who lead their lives with a real sense of purpose -- something this city has never lacked.

Los Angeles is one of the world's most misunderstood cities. It's easy to fall in love with the idea of this place, but once you're here -- as many friends who are transplants have told me -- a different reality often sets in. The pace can occasionally underwhelm you, you lose a sense of time and space because of the lack of dramatic changes that come with each season, and amid the seemingly vast horizon, a sense of geographic vertigo can occur. Maybe that's why visitors and transplants hold on to the stereotypes of this city. When I was growing up in Southeast Los Angeles, I never knew about these misconceptions, that everyone works in Hollywood, there's no ""culture,"" and it's a city that lacks a rich history. To me, Hollywood seemed like it was a thousand miles away, I didn't know where Hollywood Walk of Fame began or ended, or even where Runyon Canyon, one of the most popular tourist attractions, was located. The Los Angeles that travelers visit is not the one that I know, and many people who know the city feel the same way.

The Los Angeles that I know is deeply connected to working class Latino communities and families who work multiple jobs to provide for families on both sides of the United States- Mexico border. Or African-American families who found joy while struggling to make ends meet amid the constant and growing threat of displacement throughout South Los Angeles. Unbenknownst to many, it has a history of public transportation that was the world's most extensive: the Pacific Electric Railway.

As a child I lived minutes away from the epicenter of the 1992 Los Angeles Riots and moved to a community with my mother in West Los Angeles on the border of Mar Vista and Venice that was comprised of working class families shortly after. Like my own, many of the families that I grew up with during the mid-1990s were busy reconciling the way that this city was often depicted in film and in media: worlds removed from the reality of the lives we were living. It usually meant us gathering around our television to watch award shows like the Oscars or people on episodes of Baywatch who looked nothing like the people in my family or community. What my family and I often looked forward to were the stories that my mother would have for us when she came from working as a valet parking attendant at a fancy hotel in Santa Monica to afford U.C.L.A.'s tuition and provide for me, her only child. Whenever we had a chance we would take the Metro Blue Line down to Long Beach to spend a day at the beach.

Like any other city, Los Angeles can only fully be understood through the experiences of people who were born and raised there or have spent a considerable amount of time living here. Writing about this city is a hard task to embark on for transplants, but it's even becoming a tough feat for people who were born and raised here. The sweeping pace of change sometimes even leaves us questioning whether or not we still know this city. Los Angeles will continue to be destination for people who wish to remake themselves. For this group of people (in recent years, droves of New Yorkers), Los Angeles is a choice; for others, including immigrants from Mexico, Central America, and Asia who flee economically and politically precarious situations, it sometimes feels like the only option. There will always be people who find that the true marker for a city is not its structural blueprint that it rests on. It is defined by the people who lead their lives with a real sense of purpose -- something this city has never lacked.

Movies,Why Pedro Almodóvar's Newest Film Frightened His Friends,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/movies/pedro-almodovar-pain-glory.html,"Pedro Almodovar is fun at parties, but parties aren't always fun for Pedro Almodovar. ""Socializing has really exhausted me as time has gone by,"" Almodovar told me in September, not long after he had jetted from his home in Madrid to the Toronto International Film Festival to present his latest movie, ""Pain and Glory."" It was a surprising thing to hear from a director whose early films, including ""Law of Desire"" and ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,"" often possessed the anything-goes spirit and mischievous cast of a crowded bacchanal. Even over two days in Toronto, I had watched Almodovar breeze through an ambitious schedule of press obligations as if he were born to make small talk in a second language. But when he returned to Madrid , Almodovar phoned me to confess that as he had gotten older in recent years -- his 70th birthday was on Sept. 25 -- he had begun to purposefully isolate himself. ""People have stopped surprising me so much, they've stopped exciting me as much. And secondly, there's the pain."" He paused. ""Pain is not something you can share with other people.""

Antonio Banderas stars in the film as Salvador Mallo, a filmmaker patterned so obviously on Almodovar himself that he wears the director's own clothes and lives in a replica of Almodovar's chic apartment. Mallo made his name on sensational Spanish sex comedies, but when we meet him, he's so racked with the pains of getting older that he doesn't have the energy to create anymore. Those aches take many forms, both physical and spiritual. Mallo is debilitated by frequent migraines and back spasms, and he's also haunted by a past relationship torn asunder by drugs as well as a mother he feels he has failed. All of these maladies were taken from Almodovar's own life, and that candor caught Banderas off guard when he read the script. ""There were things I never thought he was going to expose, not even to his friends,"" Banderas said. ""Pedro is a very private person.""

But ""Pain and Glory"" was different. For all his open-book ebullience, there were still things Almodovar had kept hidden, especially the extent to which he must navigate wrenching pain as a daily indignity. After he sent the screenplay to Banderas and his other frequent collaborators, including the actress Penelope Cruz and his producer-brother, Agustin, ""all of them came back to me really worried,"" Almodovar recalled. ""They were saying, 'Are you really as bad off as Salvador is? Are you suffering that much?'"" Fortunately, there are a few key differences. Mallo turns to a newfound heroin habit to cope with his pain, while Almodovar swears he's never touched the stuff. And though Banderas wears his hair grayed and unruly for the role, it's no match for the actual Almodovar's famous, dandelion-like pouf, a sign that this is much more than just an easy impersonation. (In May, Banderas took the best-actor trophy at the Cannes Film Festival for his deeply felt performance.) ""But the character doesn't moan about his ailments, and I'm not a person who complains, either,"" Almodovar noted. To use the parlance of pain, Almodovar decided to rip the Band-Aid off: If he was going to let the whole world know what's been hurting him , he had no intention of milking any of it for sympathy. Instead, he spends a minute and 20 seconds of ""Pain and Glory"" listing all of his physical troubles in a tidy animated sequence. It's a gut punch of grievances, though he couldn't help but make it colorful, too.

SOCIALIZING MAY TAKE its toll on Almodovar these days, but I'll be damned if he's not still good at it. When I sat down with him in Toronto, he was talkative and funny, and he pumped me for details on a party he'd skipped the night before. (""Was Jennifer Lopez there?"" he asked, ready to gossip.) Across from us sat his translator . Though Almodovar speaks fast, fluent English, he frequently toggles over to Spanish like someone breaking into song in a musical. It's easy to see what beguiled Banderas so long ago in Madrid's Cafe Gijon, where the young actor had gathered with other thespians from the nearby Teatro Maria Guerrero. It was 1981, and Almodovar, fresh off his first full-length feature, ""Pepi, Luci, Bom,"" had wandered over to the group to hold court. ""He appeared with this red plastic briefcase, and he talked -- a lot -- in this beautiful monologue,"" Banderas recalled. ""After 20 minutes, he stood up, looked at me and said, 'You should do movies. You have a very romantic face.' And he left.""

Before long, Almodovar had offered Banderas a role in his next movie, the comedy ""Labyrinth of Passion,"" kicking off a juicy collaboration that would span several decades and bring them both international fame. Almodovar was the button-pushing auteur, Banderas was his sex-bomb male muse, and they lived colorful lives that spilled across Madrid's night life. ""I was like somebody invited to a party they didn't know about,"" Banderas said. ""I wanted to be a serious theater actor, and suddenly I was in the middle of that tsunami."" Through it all, Banderas was both enamored of and intimidated by his director: ""We were all in a group of friends,"" he said, ""but Pedro was the pope."" As their profiles rose, especially after the Oscar-nominated ""Women on the Verge"" and ""Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!,"" Hollywood came to court both men. Only Banderas made the leap, working in major films including ""Philadelphia"" and ""The Mask of Zorro."" Almodovar, offered the chance to direct studio comedies like ""Sister Act,"" decided to stay in Spain. ""I have to confess that I missed him a lot in the beginning of the '90s,"" Almodovar said. ""I had the impression that one day, when we were older, we would meet each other again, but I was in no rush for that re-encounter. In my head, I wanted to reconnect with an older, more mature, more adult Antonio, as if all that youthful energy had already exploded.""

But it would take two decades for that reunion, and when it arrived, things did not go smoothly. Almodovar cast Banderas as a sociopathic plastic surgeon in ""The Skin I Live In,"" and both men had changed considerably in the interim. Almodovar was in a new phase of his career, directing polished, Oscar-winning melodramas like ""All About My Mother"" and ""Talk to Her,"" while Banderas had become a Hollywood star, blossoming outside Almodovar's tutelage. Banderas said, ""I arrived on set with all my new things that I had learned over 22 years. 'Look Pedro, I'm now more secure in front of the camera, I have worked on my voice and my body, this and that.'"" Almodovar was dismissive. ""He said, 'These things, I cannot use.'"" Both men described the shoot as rocky. ""The fact that I was encountering an actor who was very experienced wasn't an advantage to me,"" Almodovar said. ""Quite the contrary. What I was looking for was that innocence, an actor who relies on his intuition, not his intelligence."" Eventually, Banderas acceded to his director's demands, and once he saw the final cut, he said he was impressed by what Almodovar had pulled from him. Still, after all that, he had no reason to expect that his old collaborator would give him another starring role. Time had passed, and perhaps their moment had, too.

""PAIN IS PASSIVE,"" Almodovar told me. ""Someone suffering from pain isn't easy to film -- it's not cinematic at all."" So when he began writing ""Pain and Glory,"" he did not have Banderas in mind to play the lead: What use would the actor's boundless vitality be in a muted role like that? Then, Almodovar happened across a photo of Banderas as he was recovering from surgery after a 2017 heart attack. ""I saw the experience of pain in his face, and that was something very important to the character,"" Almodovar said. He knew he had his Mallo, and now, in an irony worthy of his movies, it would be Almodovar serving as the muse for Banderas. This time on set, director and actor were in sync: Instead of impersonating Almodovar, Banderas should go small. ""He still ended up stealing the scenes from other characters because of that subtlety!"" Almodovar said, laughing. But the role served an olive branch: Banderas played it as a tribute to the man who had transformed his life, and when Almodovar went to embrace his actor on the final day of shooting, he burst into tears. ""It was shocking for everybody on the set -- the casting director, the art director, everybody,"" Banderas said, adding, ""He's not like that. Pedro is a hard cookie."" Almodovar was as surprised as anybody. Despite the fact that he had drawn so much of the film from his own life, when he was on set, he had tried to treat Mallo as a character, someone separate from himself. Now, as he embraced Banderas, that all fell away, and he couldn't stop crying.","The director who surprised even friends with his confessional new drama, ""Pain and Glory,"" has turned inward, in life and on the screen.",1793fae5-03d4-570a-833c-7858e874a2ea,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/06/arts/06pedro-almodovar1/06pedro-almodovar1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=6b1768386f0f8e0346659d854166cf591a57cbe71a7f445694768a4af27b3bd8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"His new film has surprised longtime colleagues: ""There were things I never thought he was going to expose, not even to his friends,"" Antonio Banderas said.",1793fae5-03d4-570a-833c-7858e874a2ea,N24News/imgs/1793fae5-03d4-570a-833c-7858e874a2ea.jpg,5
Real Estate,The Beach House on the Fifth Floor,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/realestate/brighton-beach-habitats-the-beach-house-on-the-fifth-floor.html,"WHEN Jack Resnick thinks of summer, he thinks of Brighton Beach, the broad expanse of Brooklyn waterfront just south of Sheepshead Bay. Dr. Resnick was born in 1946 in a displaced persons' camp in Germany. His parents, Eastern European Jews, had survived the war in hiding. The Resnicks came to the United States when he was 3, and except for a few years in Baltimore, lived in various neighborhoods in Brooklyn. On weekends, the family used to take the subway to Brighton Beach, where Dr. Resnick remembers his father swimming rhythmic laps along the shore, enjoying respites from long days working in the garment industry. ""We'd go right to the beach, which would be so covered with blankets, you couldn't see the sand,"" said Dr. Resnick, an internist with a solo practice on Roosevelt Island. ""It was a real boy-meets-girl place in those years, with the boardwalk and all."" He remembers the knish stands and the kosher pizza, though not the seafood at the fabled Lundy's because his family was Orthodox. He also remembers water so murky with pollution that he couldn't see his body below the surface. When he looked down, all was blackness.

""But I remember being very happy,"" he said. ""I loved the freedom."" Dr. Resnick's father died more than two decades ago. He himself is a grandparent. The waters of Brighton Beach have been cleaned to a crystalline shimmer. And two years ago, with his wife, Barbara Fisher, he returned, in a sense, to the summers of his youth. Unlike friends from the Upper West Side, who typically vacation in places like the Hamptons, Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard, Dr. Resnick and Ms. Fisher have started spending long weekends on a beach just 17 miles from their apartment on West End Avenue.

Dr. Resnick, an avid cyclist, sometimes makes the trip by bike. The journey is 23 miles and takes an hour and 45 minutes if he follows the scenic route along the water. If he and his wife travel by subway, their blue-eyed Tonkinese, Sparky, makes the trip in a small black cat-carrier. Both had been married previously, and between them they have six grown sons. Dr. Resnick had summer houses in Sag Harbor and in Truro on Cape Cod. Ms. Fisher, a writer who for many years taught English at the New School for Social Research, remembers childhood vacations by the water. ""My father was a psychiatrist,"" she said, ""so we used to go to places where psychiatrists went, like Wellfleet and Provincetown."" Ms. Fisher and Dr. Resnick, who were married in 2001, live in a three-bedroom apartment on West End Avenue. During their years together, they have traveled extensively -- to Europe, Asia and Latin America. But shuttling to and from summer houses proved both expensive and time-consuming. At the same time, Dr. Resnick felt a tug that pulled him back to South Brooklyn. Sometimes the couple took the subway to Brighton Beach and just strolled along the boardwalk. ""For me, it was sort of weird,"" Ms. Fisher said. ""I was born and raised in Manhattan, and in my whole life, I'd never even been to Brooklyn.""

Yet the idea of a summer place on the Brooklyn waterfront proved increasingly intriguing, and in fall 2010 they bought a two-bedroom, fifth-floor apartment on Corbin Place, for which they paid $485,000. Their building, erected in 1941, is at the water's edge. The beach is just steps from their back door. For Dr. Resnick, the experience is pleasantly deja vu. Ms. Fisher -- Barbsie to her friends -- is still marveling at their decision. ""I would never have thought to do this myself,"" she said. ""But Jackie is a man of no social pretensions. He doesn't realize the extent to which something like this goes against the grain. And he doesn't care."" Although the two have been spending weekends at the apartment since last summer, only this spring did they embark on a renovation. They removed old linoleum and fake veneers, opened up the kitchen and outfitted it with granite countertops and stone floor tile. The decor is very different from that of their Upper West Side apartment, with its rich color scheme and country French furnishings, and the place is still awaiting such final touches as art and bookshelves. But with its pristine white walls, neutral color palette and minimal furnishings, the Brooklyn apartment has the spare, stripped-down look of a cottage by the shore.

This apartment couldn't be more different from their neighbors' homes. The community has in recent decades become a magnet for new Russian immigrants, who have erected mansions with columned entranceways and gilded spiral staircases. Here in the place some call Little Odessa, Russian is the language heard on the street, and even pizzerias have signs in Cyrillic lettering. Dr. Resnick and Ms. Fisher are savoring such local institutions as the Russian greengrocers and bakery and the array of ethnic restaurants. Last year they celebrated their 65th birthdays with a party for 60 friends at Tatiana, a popular Russian restaurant on the boardwalk, complete with a stage show that featured outfits adorned with feathers and sequins. ""It was like Las Vegas manque,"" Ms. Fisher said. ""Really, it was a little nutty."" But most of their time is spent quietly, just swimming or sitting on the beach. In the evening, they watch as elaborately dressed Russians, many with little dogs at the ends of leashes, stroll along the boardwalk, giving it the look and feel of a promenade in a European or Latin American city. And they're becoming accustomed to the polite but sometimes dubious reactions of many friends. ""The first reaction is disbelief,"" Ms. Fisher said. ""They won't say, 'Are you nuts?' They'll say: 'You really got a place in Brighton Beach? How interesting. Maybe we should sell our place and move there.' But we know they won't.""","Jack Resnick and Barbara Fisher live in Manhattan, but for weekends they have traded seaside villages for an apartment a subway ride away in Brighton Beach.",2c1640fa-813d-5532-81b4-574a04a5963d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/07/22/realestate/habi-1/habi-1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=364&w=600&s=80c86ea9e75e38ebfc24c2b99d35159788291e16e5acb68999340dad2328b7c4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Barbara Fisher and Jack Resnick retreat to Brighton Beach, his boyhood haunt, when they need to get away from their home on the Upper West Side.",2c1640fa-813d-5532-81b4-574a04a5963d,N24News/imgs/2c1640fa-813d-5532-81b4-574a04a5963d.jpg,7
Food,The Polarizing Power of Orange Wine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/dining/drinks/orange-wine-skin-contact.html,"From a distance, what divides white wines from reds seems pretty clear. Yes, the color is obvious, but it's also the methods of production. To make red wine, the producer begins by macerating the juice of the grapes with the pigment-bearing skins. This adds not only color to the juice but also tannins, which contribute texture and structure to the darkening wine. When the fermentation is complete and the winemaker is satisfied, the wine is drawn off the skins to begin the aging process. Conventional white wines are made differently. A winemaker might allow the juice to soak for a few hours, or a day, with the skins, which are pale but not entirely without pigment. The juice is whisked away far more quickly than it would be with reds, to begin its fermentation with minimal color and undetectable tannins. What if the producer switched things up? Let's say you had red grapes, but processed them using the techniques for making white wine. A lot of winemakers do just that, leaving the juice in contact with the skins for only a short while, just long enough to gain a pink tinge. Millions of bottles of these wines are sold each summer -- ""Waiter, bring me rose!""

By contrast, imagine that you had white grapes and wanted to make wine using the method for reds, keeping the juice in prolonged contact with the pale skins. This yields something altogether different, a wine seen far less often than rose. People are still grappling with what to call these sorts of wines. Some use the phrase amber wine, which describes the color of at least a few examples. They can otherwise range from pale pink to rosy copper, russet or a dark, almost ruby-shaded brown. Others prefer the phrase skin-contact whites or even skin-macerated whites, which, while technically correct, lacks any sort of evocative power. Most, though, have settled on orange wine, a term that has piqued the imagination of a generous percentage of the wine-buying public. It's not literally accurate, of course, but for that matter, neither are white wines white nor reds red. Orange wines may seem trendy, like a hipster fashion that bewitches bargoers from London to Tokyo. That view would not be unreasonable, given the 20-year trajectory of modern orange wines.

But wines made like this are the oldest form of whites, stretching back centuries if not millenniums. In some parts of the world, like the Republic of Georgia, white wine never stopped being made this way, despite formidable political and cultural pressure during the years of Soviet domination to adopt more conventional methods of mass production. The twin forces of history and fashion combine to create a remarkable tension around orange wines. They have been celebrated in places where they have a long history, like Georgia and Slovenia, as emblems of cultural identity, while simultaneously being dismissed elsewhere for their vapid trendiness. They have been hailed as innovative expressions, and damned as flawed, oxidized, repetitive and dull. Both the praise and the criticism have been well earned. Some orange wines are in fact insipid. People tire of them quickly when the novelty disappears. But why would it be surprising to find bad examples of any type of wine? Others are thought to be flawed only because their unfiltered haziness and tannins are so strange among white wines. The best orange wines succeed not because they are orange but because they express nuances of beauty and culture in profound and distinctive ways. Wines like those from Josko Gravner and Radikon -- who both work in the Collio region of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, where northeast Italy touches Slovenia -- were among the earliest and most influential in the renaissance of these wines. They resonate not just because they are so good qualitatively, but also because, in their reckoning with centuries of history and conflict, they speak powerfully, both emotionally and intellectually.

Mr. Gravner was a successful conventional winemaker in the 1980s and '90s before rejecting modern trappings. His quest for something more satisfying took him to Georgia, where he was inspired by the local technique, stretching back thousands of years, of fermenting wine in qvevri, or amphorae, buried in the earth to stay cool. He brought qvevri and the techniques of skin-maceration back to his winery, where, since 2001, his production has set a standard for orange wines. Stanko Radikon never adopted amphorae. But he made his own experiments and developed techniques that radically reimagined how his ancestors might have made wine. His son, Sasa, has continued the tradition since Mr. Radikon's death in 2016. The Gravner and Radikon wines share some qualities. They are both textured with lightly raspy tannins. They are energetic, with aromas and flavors that, like many orange wines, tend toward pressed flowers and dried fruits rather than fresh ones. But they are different as well. The Gravner wines are vibrant yet intense. They are deeply philosophical, yet not without joy. The Radikons are equally complex, but seem a little more lighthearted and sunny. Both are beautiful, and both are made to exacting standards by artisans who work the edge, taking risks that they manage with scrupulous attention to details.

Farther south, in Umbria, Paolo Bea produces Arboreus, a waxy, bright and juicy wine made of trebbiano spoletino. In the Tyrnavos region of Greece, south of Thessaloniki, Papras makes Pleiades, a hazy amber, floral wine, made of the roditis grape, with flavors reminiscent of orange. From Portugal, the Aphros Phaunus, made of the loureiro grape, was fermented in amphorae. It's bright, lively and balanced. And from Georgia, I had a wonderful wine that could have been mistaken for a light red. It was the 2017 Zurab Topuridze from the Guria region. Made of the chkhaveri grape, it had wild flavors of dried flowers, dried fruits and spices, and it went beautifully with grilled flank steak. From closer to home, I recently had two skin-fermented pinot gris. One was from Two Shepherds in Sonoma Valley, the other from Donkey & Goat, which buys the grapes from the Anderson Valley in Mendocino. Pinot gris, like the Greek roditis, is a white grape with a distinct pink cast, which gives the wines a coppery hue when made with skin-contact techniques.

Far more wonderful examples exist, particularly in Georgia, Slovenia and the Friuli-Venezia Giulia region. For more suggestions, Simon J. Woolf's book ""Amber Revolution"" is an excellent source. The best places to buy orange wines tend to be shops that also have selections of natural wines. Sometimes orange wines turn up where you least expect to find them. I recently came upon a 2017 Akatcha, a skin-macerated white from Simon Bize et Fils, one of my favorite Burgundy producers. It was made of pinot beurot, the Burgundian name for pinot gris, which is legally permitted in Burgundy but rarely seen. It was spicy, energetic and herbal, with long, lingering flavors.

As with all types of wine, good and bad versions abound. Flaws that used to be common in wine, like oxidation or too much volatile acidity, have largely been vanquished in conventional wines. But they can still appear in wines, like many in the orange genre, that avoid technological solutions to these sorts of problems. That may sound as if I'm placing orange wines in the natural-wine category. Many would qualify, but not nearly all. Natural wines must satisfy a much greater set of imperatives, including how the grapes are farmed, while orange wines must simply be skin-macerated. While faults may seem starkly obvious in orange and natural wines, it's important to understand that the faults of dullness, sameness and bland sterility are accepted without comment in conventional wines because they are so common. That does not excuse either set of faults. But it helps in understanding them.","The best examples of these white wines, made with red techniques, are striking and wonderful.

Travel,"Elena Ferrante's Naples, Then and Now",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/travel/elena-ferrante-naples.html,"The historic center of Naples drips with Old World charm -- faded laundry strung between buildings, fish shops spilling tubs of clams and eels onto the sidewalk, pasticcerie tucked near Renaissance churches. But I was looking for something else. I had come to Naples without a guidebook or even a map, in search of a disheveled neighborhood of ""flaking walls"" and ""scratched doors,"" where the ""wretched grey"" of the buildings clashed with the passion and repression of the characters of the writer Elena Ferrante. Armed only with her series of Neapolitan novels, I was in search of a city that -- through four weighty volumes, best sellers both in the United States and Italy -- had become a character itself: dangerous, dirty and seductive, the place everyone yearns to leave behind, and the place they can't shake. As I discovered during a visit in September, the series of books offered a unique view of this complicated city, leading me away from popular tourist sites and helping to explain the city's social, economic and geographic divisions. To view the Naples of Ms. Ferrante is to view Naples like a native.

Recently, the Italian investigative journalist Claudio Gatti attempted to unmask Ms. Ferrante, claiming that numerous financial and real estate records identify the author as the Italian translator, Anita Raja. The reaction from the author's fans was passionate, with many condemning Mr. Gatti for invading the author's privacy. Ms. Ferrante's publisher declined to confirm or deny Gatti's speculations. Their official biography, however, refers to Ferrante as a woman, and offers a single personal detail: ""Elena Ferrante was born in Naples."" The quartet of novels -- which also includes ""The Story of a New Name,"" ""Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay"" and ""The Story of the Lost Child"" -- traces the lives of Elena Greco and Raffaella Cerullo, two girls from a dismal Naples rione, a neighborhood characterized by poverty, Mafia vendettas, and violence. Born weeks apart in August 1944, the girls -- who call each other Lenu and Lila -- are best friends and fierce competitors, each spurring the other to stunning academic achievement. Lenu, cautious and conscientious, eventually escapes the neighborhood through diligent study (and exchanges her childhood nickname for her given name, Elena). Lila, impulsive and daring, blazes through life, eyes narrowed to cracks, a ""terrible, dazzling girl"" who pushes Lenu to audacious acts -- as on the day the pair skip school and, for the first time in their young lives, try to ""cross the boundaries of the neighborhood"" to discover an invisible presence, ""a vague bluish memory"": the sea. As I strolled west along a narrow street in the historic center, eyes blinded by the late-afternoon sun, with the closely set buildings hemming in the sight of sky and smells of cooking, the sea felt distant indeed. My friend, Paola, said to me: ""We call this Spaccanapoli. It means Naples split in half.""

Like many ancient Roman cities, she explained, Naples had been planned along parallel decumanus, roads with an east-west orientation. This particular street cuts through the city's heart. ""The farther east you go,"" Paola, a native Napolitana, said, ""the poorer the neighborhoods."" I walked a block or two, and the Gulf of Naples flashed before me, all turquoise twinkle. Was it plausible that 10-year-old Lenu and Lila could have gone their whole lives without glimpsing this port city's defining feature? The answer, I knew, lay beyond the tourist district, in the shabby streets of their rione. With the help of Irene Caselli, a Naples native and journalist now based in Buenos Aires, I had come close to identifying their neighborhood: it was almost certainly the Rione Luzzatti. But, she warned me: ""It has a dangerous, dirty reputation. Don't go after dark. Don't walk alone."" Rione Luzzatti is bordered to the east by the central train station and to the north by a prison, Poggioreale. ""It's not so far,"" said Paola -- in fact, it's less than five miles from the historic center -- ""but it's a mental distance."" Given the area's reputation for crime, I hired a local guide, Francesca Siniscalchi, who, like virtually all the women I met in Naples, is an avid Ferrante fan.

""Her portrayal of Naples isn't just a postcard -- it's a mosaic of strong, disruptive emotions,"" Ms. Siniscalchi said of the books. ""She gives an excellent description of all the opportunities lost by every single generation in the south of Italy. When I finished the last book, I cried."" In the Rione Luzzatti, we found a cluster of dingy, dirt-streaked buildings, their narrow windows curtained by laundry, patches of unkempt grass, litter-strewn sidewalks empty despite the late-summer sunshine. Voices clashed deep within one of the apartment buildings, a hint that people were home and, perhaps, watching us. The bar-pastry shop and shoemaker from the books were missing; a fruit-and-vegetable vendor displayed wares from a truck instead of a horse-drawn cart. But despite these small differences, I needed no leap of imagination to see Elena and Lila's neighborhood. Here in this ""dim and distant rock pile"" of ""indistinguishable urban debris,"" the sea did seem like a fantasy. After the rione, the glossy elegance of Chiaia, the city's well-heeled shopping district, hit me like the blow of a stick. As teens, Elena and Lila's first foray here leaves them astonished by the chic women who seem ""to have breathed another air,"" Ms. Ferrante writes, ""to have learned to walk on wisps of wind."" Though the outing ends in violence, when a pack of wealthy boys calls their group ""hicks"" and a bloody fight ensues, these streets play a role throughout the series -- the luxurious yin to the rione's desolate yang.

After wandering down the Via Chiaia amid a crowd of stylish locals, I paused at Piazza dei Martiri to look for Solara, the shoe shop Lila decorates with a gigantic, disfigured copy of her bridal portrait, creating an artistic image of her body ""cruelly shredded."" Instead I found a Salvatore Ferragamo boutique and, across the majestic plaza, the Feltrinelli bookshop, displaying stacks of Ms. Ferrante's books. As Elena and Lila advance from girlhood to middle age, they face an era of tumultuous social upheaval -- radical feminism, 1968 demonstrations, friends who dabble in militant Communism -- and their youthful hope eventually turns to disillusionment. ""I've felt the same way -- guilty, self-critical,"" Annamaria Palermo, a professor at the University of Naples ""L'Orientale,"" told me. We were in her airy apartment, surrounded by book-lined walls, terra-cotta tile floors, and large windows framing views of the Gulf of Naples. ""In 1968, we had so many feelings of power. I was sure we would change everything."" Ms. Palermo was born in 1943, one year before Ms. Ferrante's protagonists, to a bourgeois Naples family. Still, she identified with the books. ""There is a Neapolitanness that cuts through social levels. She communicates this very well. These novels go deep into our souls,"" she said. ""I am very attached to this city, but it is like the mermaid of Capri -- something enchanting you, but something disgusting you inside,"" she said, referring to the sirens from ""The Odyssey,"" who bewitched sailors to death with their sweet songs.",The anonymous author's novels can serve as a sort of guidebook to modern Naples.,854584f8-86cd-5ee0-8209-ee5e4394e1d4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/17/travel/17NAPLES/17NAPLES-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=5eac1256a74a1c26b678da62c52e3182b2ec2b42ee93cfa808da5063bb723052&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Mount Vesuvius looms over Naples.

Fresh out of prison, Debbie hatches a monumental heist: snatching a $150 million dollar Cartier necklace off the neck of an actress (Anne Hathaway) during the annual Met Gala. Cate Blanchett, Mindy Kaling and Sarah Paulson -- to name a few -- play her co-conspirators. In her review, Manohla Dargis said a subplot involving guy troubles proves ""needless.""

'DROPPING GUMBALLS ON LUKE WILSON' at A.R.T./New York Theaters (in previews; opens on June 18). The playwright Rob Ackerman (""Tabletop"") also works as a property master, and this new comedy, adapted from a true story, recalls a time on an AT&T commercial when he demonstrated something less than mastery. For the Working Theater, Theresa Rebeck directs a cast that includes Ann Harada and Dean Nolen.

'LIFE SUCKS' at the Acorn Theater at Theater Row (in previews; opens on June 16). A sort of adaptation of Anton Chekhov's ""Uncle Vanya"" is definitely back for an encore run. In April, when reviewing this comedy of dreams deferred, Elisabeth Vincentelli praised the playwright Aaron Posner as understanding ""full well that there is no date stamp on feeling stranded between regrets and hopes, between fancy dreams and the banality of existence.""

Real Estate,E.J. Burke,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/realestate/commercial/interview-burke-mortgage-bankers-chairman.html,"Mr. Burke, 58, is chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association, a national organization based in Washington that represents the real estate finance industry. He is also a newly named co-president of KeyBank's community bank, specializing in commercial and private banking. KeyBank is based in Cleveland. Q. What does ""E .J."" stand for? A. Edward James. I'm a junior, actually, so my family, to distinguish between me and my father, called me E. J. My father died a long time ago so I dropped the junior part. Q. You were sworn in as the M.B.A. chairman last October. What do you see as your main role there? A. As the chair, I'm supposed to provide oversight of the staff and the C.E.O. I also do a fair amount of lobbying, and I do a lot of travel on behalf of the association. I go to a lot of state association events to get a sense of what's happening in the industry. And in our industry there is a lot happening today. Q. Starting with the new federal rules defining a ""qualified mortgage."" A. The definition of qualified mortgage has helped lenders understand better the guidelines. I think our members, more than anything else, want clarity. They want to know what the rules are.

Q. There are also continuing efforts to reform the government-sponsored entities, or G.S.E., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A. You're not going to get much more private capital until we see G.S.E. reform pass in Congress. Two bills have been put forth. One is Corker-Warner in the Senate and the other is the PATH Act in the House. We think that some variation on Corker-Warner has a pretty good chance of coming to the Senate. We like a lot of the elements, so in our opinion, if Congress acts, they put forth a G.S.E. reform bill that provides clarity, it provides a path to taking Fannie and Freddie out of conservatorship. I think, when that happens, you'll see private capital say, O.K., I'm willing to come into the market. Fannie has so much market share, and there really is no competition. I'm optimistic that we might actually see some legislation. Q. How would you categorize the state of the lending industry right now? A. This year we expect residential mortgage origination to be down about 40 percent, because the amount of ""refi"" business is down. But the economy is slowly getting better. In the end, it's income that repays loans, so the more stability we have in the job market, the easier it will be to qualify people for mortgages. So it is slowly getting better.

Q. And on the commercial side? A. On the commercial side, it's very good. And it's very good for a couple of reasons: One, is that we had almost no addition to supply between, say, '08 and probably '11, and really only in multifamily have we seen any significant increase in supply. So that, along with a slowly improving economy, has made a lot of commercial properties improve their fundamentals. The other thing is the amount of capital that wants to be invested in the commercial sector is significantly higher than on the residential side. I'm talking about office, industrial and retail, too. Q. A focus of your job at KeyBank is commercial lending. Are you lending more? A. Yes. In '13, if you look at loans that we originated and syndicated to other banks, including those we kept for ourselves, loans we originated and sold via Fannie and Freddie, F.H.A., Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities, and all of that, we put out about $30 billion in commercial real estate finance. In '12, it was about $20 billion. I think that this year we will do a little bit more than we did last year. I would be pleased if we grew our total origination between 5 and 10 percent. Q. Who are some of your larger clients? A. We focus on owners of real estate. That includes people who develop, but we have a very active REIT practice. Our top clients include American Campus Communities and DuPont Fabros Technology. We're the lead bank for BioMed Realty, which owns biomedical research buildings. We don't do as much in New York. KeyBank is a $90 billion bank, and it's difficult to compete with the trillionaires. We do some in New York, but we're more of a middle-market bank. Q. What's your outlook for interest rates this year, particularly the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage? A. I think they're going to rise -- if I knew how much I probably wouldn't be sitting here right now. As the economy seems to be getting better -- and it seems like a slow, steady progress -- it seems the Fed will lower their bond buying.

I think you could see as much as 50 basis points by the end of the year for the 30-year mortgage. It seems like the long end of the curve is going to go up faster than the short end. Q. So that means you're seeing increased interest in adjustable rate mortgages? A. We have, and I think we will. And many lenders are not doing a teaser rate, because that's what got people in trouble the last time. They're going to qualify people at a much higher rate. I see it more on the commercial side. Q. How do you balance your time between your M.B.A. role and your KeyBank job? A. Well, it's very difficult. But first of all, the way M.B.A. sets up their leadership, you have what they call a leadership ladder, so I spent one year as a vice chair and a year as a chair-elect, and so that gave me a bit of time to plan for this year. And everybody at the bank has also been prepared for this year. In my job I can make an argument to be somewhere in the United States almost every day, because there's always a client meeting. And so you end up planning your year.","Mr. Burke is chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association, a national organization based in Washington that represents the real estate finance industry.",7026ed6b-12ed-586e-ab6e-8ef0a671c72f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/23/business/INTERVIEW/INTERVIEW-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=866&w=600&s=94cd04a5f412c704fd2d283bac6fcc1a3b3228d43477948bc85c9751ffef8eb1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,E.J.

Fashion & Style,Open Thread: This Week in Style News,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/04/fashion/open-thread-this-week-in-style-news.html,"But before I go, let me encourage you to read this story about a Brooklyn designer who upended his life by moving to Italy, to ponder the culture of lines and to dive into a Frank Ocean-inspired brouhaha. Talk to you at the end of the month.

Every week on Open Thread, Vanessa will answer a reader's fashion-related question, which you can send to her anytime via email or Twitter. Questions are edited and condensed.

Q: I'm a 28 year-old IP attorney in the Midwest. I gravitate toward preppy styles, neutrals, and when not in the office, casual looks with a touch of style. I've struggled for a while now with the feeling that I'm too old for certain styles/looks/pieces. I'll go through phases where I purge everything that I feel I'm too old for -- short denim shorts, anything with sequins -- only to re-buy similar items a few months down the road because I decide that exceptions can be made if styled correctly. (Not to mention, I look around and see people older than myself wearing these things). This cycle extends to my beauty products. My bank account and peace of mind could seriously benefit from some overarching guidance as to what, if anything, becomes off-limits when you hit 30. Thanks! -- ALLIE L.

A: Not long after I turned 40 I found myself in a YSL pre-collection presentation when out walked a model in a tuxedo shorts jumpsuit and I found myself thinking: ""Yes! That would solve so many problems for me if I got it and didn't want to wear a dress to a black tie party."" Then I took a deep breath and thought: ""Get a grip. You are way past the days of tuxedo onesies."" Which is to say: The question of how to dress your age never goes away, especially as we exercise more and don't have the same physical limitations our grandparents may have had. So absent obvious guidelines, my general rule of thumb is: Imagine what your kids would think (or your imaginary kids).

I know there is a move toward mini-me dressing, with parents and children appearing in much the same styles, but as far as I am concerned, that erodes the psychological distance of adulthood we all need, as much to signal to ourselves we are grown-ups as to signal to others. It doesn't mean eschewing specific materials, but rather going by their associations: Denim shorts are O.K., but maybe not Daisy Dukes; a sequined sheath or tank fine, but perhaps not a crop top. Anything you could imagine a 10-year-old absconding with should probably be avoided. Or go by the free-association adjective rule: ""Elegant"" is better than ""cute""; ""seductive"" better than ""beach babe."" Finally, if you're still not sure, that's probably your sartorial superego tussling with your id. You know which one to heed. -- VANESSA FRIEDMAN","Remembering Gösta Peterson, the cult of waiting in line — and more.",f471a27f-c463-5eb3-bf7f-a922f1c89d47,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/04/obituaries/peterson-ss-slide-RNZF/peterson-ss-slide-RNZF-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=ecc0b6f831491dc81901767d9060b89dce21de5ed711f610d67aa9a2d77e8a37&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Twiggy in her first fashion shoot in the United States.

Health,Study Shows Pill Prevents H.I.V. Among Drug Addicts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/health/pill-prevents-hiv-among-drug-addicts-in-a-study.html,"Drug-injecting addicts who took a daily antiretroviral pill were half as likely to become infected with H.I.V. as those who did not, a major new study has found, providing the final piece of evidence that such treatments can prevent AIDS in every group at risk. Earlier clinical trials showed that the therapy can sharply reduce the risk of H.I.V. transmission from mother to child, and in gay and bisexual men and heterosexuals. ""This provides the totality of the evidence that the drugs used to treat the infection are also very effective at preventing it,"" said Dr. Salim S. Abdool Karim, a prominent South African AIDS researcher who wrote a commentary in The Lancet, which published the new study on Wednesday. The accumulating evidence from clinical trials means antiretroviral drugs are increasingly seen as another in the arsenal of weapons to prevent AIDS, along with condoms, abstinence and fidelity; early antiretroviral treatment; male circumcision in Africa; microbicide gels; and other options. The formal results of the study, which involved 2,400 drug users in Thailand, showed that taking tenofovir pills -- a therapy known as pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP -- reduced infections by 49 percent. Addicts who took the pills regularly, based on measures of tenofovir in their blood, did much better: They were 74 percent less likely to become infected.

""This is an exciting day,"" said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, director of H.I.V. prevention for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. ""This culminates a decade of PrEP research."" Prophylaxis usually involves taking a daily pill of tenofovir or tenofovir plus another drug, but can also include antiretroviral-laced vaginal gels used before sex and the use of various antiretroviral drugs by infected mothers just before they give birth. The potential impact of the treatment for drug addicts is greatest in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, where they account for up to 80 percent of infections. Many countries in those regions, for religious and political reasons, outlaw proven tactics like handing out clean needles or offering methadone or other needle-free opioid substitutes. About 10 percent of the new infections in the world -- and about 8 percent of those in the United States -- are thought to result from needle sharing. The new five-year study was run by Thai researchers with C.D.C. support through 17 Bangkok drug-treatment clinics. Addicts are notoriously unreliable about keeping clinic appointments and have been known to sell even lifesaving drugs, so the participants were offered modest payments to take their daily pills under the eyes of a nurse. They got $8.75 for each month they stayed in the trial, plus $8.75 for each week they showed up all seven days, plus $1.90 each day they appeared. Those who came in only monthly were paid to keep drug-use diaries.

""We should be under no illusions that these were real-world settings,"" said Mitchell Warren, executive director for AVAC, an organization that lobbies for AIDS prevention. On paper, 87 percent of all drugs were scheduled to be taken daily under observation, but some patients were much more consistent than others; women and addicts older than 40 did better. Now that it is clear that the medications work, Mr. Warren said, new studies must work out how best to motivate unpredictable drug users to take them. Dr. Julio Montaner, a University of British Columbia AIDS researcher who works with a large addict population in Vancouver, said the news that the therapy worked among drug users was ""all very good and dandy -- and a new piece to the puzzle."" But he said he worried that it would compete for limited government health budgets with tactics that he were already proven: clean needles, methadone and test-and-treat, which involves hunting aggressively for all who are infected in a city and putting them on antiretroviral treatment immediately, which makes them 96 percent less likely to infect anyone else. But Dr. Mermin of the C.D.C. said: ""I think we've moved beyond competition between prevention and treatment. Even this is not for everybody."" The United States is setting up studies, he said, to see which anti-H.I.V. tactics work best in different neighborhoods and different risk groups.

The new study may affect individual doctors' decisions. For example, a doctor with an uninfected patient known to inject drugs might choose to put that patient on daily tenofovir, just as some doctors do with uninfected but promiscuous gay male patients, or uninfected patients with infected regular sex partners. Exactly how the tenofovir protected the participants cannot be known, Dr. Karim pointed out, because many addicts both share needles and sell their bodies to get money for drugs, so they engage in two risky behaviors. Given how fast AIDS shot through various risk groups when it first appeared in the 1980s, researchers have long assumed that injecting blood and sharing needles was the riskiest behavior, followed by anal sex, then vaginal sex -- but there is little data to prove that. For that reason, some researchers thought it unlikely that pre-exposure prophylaxis would protect drug addicts, and they were pleasantly surprised it worked fairly well. Exactly how well it works in any risk group depends on how study results are analyzed, but it seems to be roughly as protective for drug users as it is for gay men, and about as protective as circumcision is for heterosexual men in Africa. According to the C.D.C., when study results are adjusted to include only participants who took their pills most of the time, the protective effects are 92 percent for gay men, nearly 90 percent for couples in which only one partner is infected, 84 percent for heterosexual men and women, and about 70 percent for drug injectors. Two trials done in heterosexual women, known as Fem-PrEP and Voice, were stopped early because women receiving drugs and those given placebos were getting infected at similar rates. Later analysis of the results showed that many of the women had not been taking their drugs. Some said they did not believe they were at risk, and others said that if they had bottles of antiretroviral medicines in their homes, their families and potential lovers would assume they were infected and shun them. But single heterosexual women in another trial, conducted in Botswana and known as TDF2, were protected.","Drug-injecting addicts who took an antiretroviral pill were half as likely to become infected with H.I.V. as those who did not, completing a body of evidence that such treatments can prevent AIDS in every group at risk.",dbb6c8a9-ee9f-52b7-a267-b5165a5dda51,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/13/science/13hiv/13hiv-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=415&w=600&s=5b7379b1621b15bab93c7a91d081bda7dbb570a1212daaa917a77b7db65b6dda&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"A patient receives medical treatment at the AIDS hospital in Bangkok, Thailand.",dbb6c8a9-ee9f-52b7-a267-b5165a5dda51,N24News/imgs/dbb6c8a9-ee9f-52b7-a267-b5165a5dda51.jpg,1
Global Business,"As Financial Gloom Deepens, Reform of British Bank Rules May Wait",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/business/global/britain-may-delay-tighter-regulations-on-banks.html,"LONDON -- Seesaw markets, growing concerns about the stability of Europe's banks and a faltering economic recovery are dimming prospects that Britain will enact stricter banking regulation anytime soon. On Monday, a government-appointed banking commission is expected to present its final recommendations on how to protect taxpayers from bearing the costs of any future bank collapses. The plan aims to separate a bank's deposit-taking business from the riskier trading and investment banking operations, which would be allowed to fail should they run into trouble. But at a time of heightened economic uncertainty, the government of Prime Minister David Cameron has grown nervous about the proposed changes, said two government officials who declined to be identified because no final decision has been made. Mr. Cameron is concerned that the changes will drive up banks' financing costs and in turn limit their ability to lend to British businesses, which would threaten an already weak economy, the officials said.

So even if the Independent Commission on Banking proposes far-reaching changes, London is likely to delay their implementation until after the next election, planned for 2015, the officials said. ""This is a political and not a financial thing now,"" said Simon Gleeson, a partner at the law firm Clifford Chance. ""What everybody hoped was that by the time we got to reforming banking regulation we'd have a more stable economy. But we don't and that's the biggest challenge."" The British economy grew just 0.2 percent in the second quarter, and the Bank of England has cut its growth forecast for this year to 1.5 percent from 1.9 percent. The British proposal would make it considerably more expensive to raise capital for investment banking and would be much more painful for Britain's banks than the so-called Volcker Rule in the United States. Under the United States approach, originally advocated in a stronger form by Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman who served as an adviser to President Obama, banks' freedom to trade with their own capital and manage hedge funds would be limited. But they would still be able to borrow money economically because their balance sheets would remain unified.

British banking executives, nervous that the new rules would increase their financing costs and threaten their credit ratings, have stepped up lobbying efforts in recent weeks. Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland would be the most affected by the new rules because they have large investment banking businesses and could see profit drop by a third, according to a research note by JPMorgan Chase. The chief executive of Barclays, Robert E. Diamond Jr., and his counterpart at R.B.S., Stephen Hester, have held lengthy discussions with the government, arguing in favor of the universal banking model, that is, leaving consumer and investment banking linked. They claimed this had helped their banks to withstand risks, according to a Treasury official who declined to be identified because the talks were private. In a preliminary report in April, the Independent Commission on Banking suggested limiting the use of consumer deposits to finance the investment banking operation by setting up a so-called ring fence around the consumer operations. On Monday, the commission is expected to give more detail on exactly which businesses should be ""ring-fenced"" and how strict the separation should be. As an example, banks could be restricted to using deposits only for personal loans and the purchase of government bonds. Angela Knight, the head of the British Bankers Association, an industry group, said the commission's proposals would weaken rather than strengthen the financial sector. ""Ring-fencing becomes unattractive to investors of all types as it reduces the benefits of diversification, gives borrowers a worse deal, and is inefficient from a capital, funding and operational perspective,"" she said. Among the biggest fears for banking executives is that the new rules would increase the financing costs of investment banking by implying the business would be allowed to fail. Interbank lenders, the executives argue, would demand higher rates in return for the higher risk. The banks' total financing costs could rise by about PS2 billion a year, according to a report by Citigroup analysts. Credit rating agencies are watching the moves closely. Moody's Investors Service said last month that the ratings of the biggest British banks were on review for a downgrade pending the commission's proposals.

Markets, too, have taken notice. British banking stocks have lagged behind European rivals this year because of uncertainty about regulatory issues. Leigh Goodwin, an analyst at Citigroup, estimated that much of the PS20 billion to PS25 billion, or about $32 billion to $40 billion, in lost market value of the three largest banks over the past year was due to ""perceived regulatory risk."" The British financial services industry accounts for about 10 percent of Britain's economic activity and 4 percent of total employment, according to Ernst & Young. The relative importance of the sector adds a pointed political dimension to the debate over banking regulation. The issue has already caused tensions within Britain's coalition government, pitting Mr. Cameron, who is willing to postpone or water down any new rules, against his business secretary, Vince Cable, who favors immediate changes. A member of the Liberal Democrats, the junior coalition partner, Mr. Cable last month accused banks of being ""disingenuous in the extreme to use the current context to argue against reform."" ""Banks are in a way trying to create a panic around something which they know has got to happen,"" he added. But Mr. Cameron appears concerned that introducing stricter regulation now would only further threaten jobs and recovery, according to the officials. These concerns are backed by an Ernst & Young report that estimated that tougher bank regulation could indirectly reduce economic growth by 0.3 percent, as higher financing costs for banks could limit their desire to lend.","Eyeing the anemic economic recovery and the financial turmoil throughout Europe, Britain's government has grown skittish about tightening the banking regulations.",78ee2a05-738c-52c7-8d43-21c4898dc401,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/09/08/business/global/08ukbanksPicA/08ukbanksPicA-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=335&w=600&s=b568477a00f3f8f4f7d36926382a99d77fd7a69581104f26b4fc84cfd212cb3f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain appears concerned that introducing stricter regulation now would further threaten jobs and recovery.,78ee2a05-738c-52c7-8d43-21c4898dc401,N24News/imgs/78ee2a05-738c-52c7-8d43-21c4898dc401.jpg,24
Movies,'Trolls World Tour' Review: Can't Hog the Mic,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/movies/trolls-world-tour-review.html,"Hi, I'm Walt Dohrn. I'm the director of 'Trolls World Tour.' ""First things first, these trolls need some serious cheering up, and we're going to have to go top shelf."" Now this scene here we find where Poppy, the queen of the Pop Trolls, is trying to connect with the Country Music Trolls by singing the most important songs of all time. So we had a lot of fun coming up with this scene. It started with hours and hours of meetings, making lists of guilty pleasures or songs so bad they're good kind of idea, really recognizable songs. We really wanted to go over the top because from the Country Music Trolls' point of view, these characters don't really understand the cultural sensitivity of this genre just yet. When we presented this notion to Anna Kendrick, who did the voice of Poppy, and Justin Timberlake, who is also our executive music producer, they rolled their eyes a little bit at the concept of this. But by the end of it, like these characters, they were completely into these songs. We had a choreographer who really choreographed this guy. And so the story artist add a lot of jokes, the choreographers add jokes, and then we take it to layout, who add some moments. And then it gets to the animators, who kind of interpret all of that business there. But one of the best jokes, I think, coming up, this kind of final joke. ""Tell 'em, Poppy."" ""Shake that!"" [WIND WHISTLING] ""You suck!"" This 'you suck' tumbleweed came out of an idea from a story artist, which I thought was really kind of perfectly described how most of the audience was feeling at this point. And this last joke here, Branch kind of has the last word. This was an improv from Justin. I think that's how he really felt. ""Well, I knew it. 'Who Let the Dogs Out,' too far.""","In this sequel, the trolls realize there's more to music than pop.",639541e0-a1ed-5fe2-82c5-65ce795a8161,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/11/arts/trolls1/trolls1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=a4e37533a186e85e7022e77ee162ce21edd0a3211dd2c5a52081e1bf65181e58&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"King Trollex, voiced by Anthony Ramos, in &ldquo;Trolls World Tour.&rdquo;",639541e0-a1ed-5fe2-82c5-65ce795a8161,N24News/imgs/639541e0-a1ed-5fe2-82c5-65ce795a8161.jpg,5
Style,"Upcycling Coins, Plastic Bags and Keys for Social Change",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/18/style/international/lebanese-jewelry-brand-vanina-has-a-social-message.html,"PARIS -- When high inflation hit the Lebanese economy in 2007, two designers turned their country's weakened currency into gold. The designers, Joanne Hayek and Tatiana Fayad, who were university students at the time, started making jewelry from depreciated coins as a ""spontaneous hobby,"" they said. They then turned it into a business. Since their casual foray into designing accessories, the Beirut-based pair has used the concept of upcycling -- reusing discarded or low-value material to create a higher-quality product -- to turn their line, Vanina, into an international brand with a social message. Vanina's latest and most opulent collection, Still Life, gives used, nonbiodegradable plastic bags a major upgrade in a collaboration with Swarovski.

The nature-inspired geometric designs feature blossoming necklaces and earrings with Swarovski crystals as their centerpieces. The jewelry is produced with a mix of high-tech design and low-tech traditional craftsmanship. Ms. Hayek, who studied architecture, uses 3-D modeling software to calculate the number of plastic bags needed to conform to a crystal's size and shape and the form that the piece will take. The jewelry is then hand stitched at the designers' atelier near Beirut. The designers, who named their brand Vanina after a 1970s pop song in French, said in an interview in Paris that they drew inspiration from the history of Beirut, as complicated as that history can sometimes seem. ""Beirut is inspiring in two ways for us,"" Ms. Hayek said. ""On the one hand, it's full of energy and beauty. At the same time, there are so many issues we force ourselves not to see, but they are still there."" Ms. Fayad and Ms. Hayek met when they were 14. They had always known that they wanted to work together when they were older, Ms. Fayad said, but weren't sure how.

Although neither had plans to plunge into fashion, the industry was a natural fit for Ms. Fayad, whose mother owns a shop in Beirut. She grew up accompanying her mother to showrooms, and took an interest in the whole process of fashion, from design to commerce. When the young women decided to convert their jewelry-making pastime into jobs -- while they were still in university -- it was a simple transition, said Ms. Fayad, who studied marketing. ""We were learning so much in our studies, and directly applying it right there with the brand,"" she said. The success of their first collection, made with the depreciated coins -- and still Vanina's best seller -- inspired them to continue coupling design with social activism. ""Everyone had a jar of those coins at home. There was an emotional attachment to the lira,"" Ms. Hayek said, using an alternate name for the Lebanese pound. ""We realized that fashion can deal with different areas of society and could be more than just dressing you up. It was a tool in our hand."" The designers have used that tool to extend their brand's social platform, touching on issues as far-ranging as environmental consciousness and war.

Vanina's Unlocked collection, made from gems and recycled keys, is ""an invitation to keep doors open,"" Ms. Hayek said, adding that the message is applicable to both politics and personal situations. For their Cease-Fire collection, the designers teamed up with the nongovernmental organization Permanent Peace Movement, which works to reduce the spread of small arms. A portion of the proceeds from the line are given to the NGO. Stems made to look like matchsticks, with rainbow-colored tips and assembled in a fanlike shape on a gold chain, form a Cleopatra-collar necklace. Their Grenade Earrings are made of a cluster of stones with an arc of shortened stems. Naturally, each piece comes in a branded matchbox. Fadi Abi Allam, the executive director of Permanent Peace Movement, said that this kind of collaboration between NGOs and private companies was rare in the region. While the line has not raised a large amount for the organization, Mr. Abi Allam said its message was important. ""The terminology 'cease-fire' means a lot: It's the first step towards peace in a war,"" Mr. Abi Allam said. ""Let's make the value of Cease-Fire itself not the money, but the awareness. The value is the same as $1 million for me."" With Vanina retail points in Dubai, New York, Paris and Tokyo, among other cities, Ms. Hayek and Ms. Fayad have made their collection grow into a budding global brand without outside investment, they say. ""We've learned to take small steps while keeping big values in mind,"" Ms. Hayek said. ""We want to reach scalability with traceability.""","Joanne Hayek and Tatiana Fayad, the founders of the Lebanese company Vanina, mix high-tech design with traditional craftsmanship.",8497efec-a27a-5071-b697-4ec756ece589,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/14/style/international/18iht-acaj-vanina18-main/18iht-acaj-vanina18-main-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=e57725a531ef149255d07d317f56256c28623166a3a9ee1a09f971b37e1ce51e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Vanina's Still Life collection gives used, nonbiodegradable plastic bags a major upgrade in a collaboration with Swarovski.",8497efec-a27a-5071-b697-4ec756ece589,N24News/imgs/8497efec-a27a-5071-b697-4ec756ece589.jpg,15
Technology,"Google, Rebuilding Its Presence in China, Invests in Retailer JD.com",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/technology/google-china-jd-com.html,"BEIJING -- Google's best-known products have been blocked by the authorities in mainland China for years. If the American internet giant wants that to change someday, then half a billion dollars' worth of good will couldn't hurt.

Google will invest $550 million in the Chinese online retailer JD.com, the two companies said on Monday. In return, JD.com will join the Google Shopping advertising platform, and will work with the Silicon Valley company on other e-commerce projects in Europe, Southeast Asia and the United States.

The companies did not provide details of the projects. According to a JD.com spokesman, the deal will give Google less than 1 percent of the Chinese retailer's shares, which trade on the Nasdaq.

Google pulled its search engine out of China in 2010, deciding that it would no longer censor its own search results as required by Beijing. But lately, the company has been looking for other ways to serve the planet's largest population of internet users.","Its search engine has been blocked in the country for years, but the company is looking for other ways to be part of the flourishing internet scene there.",3e7cee38-04b1-5eab-84da-65d9cf96eec9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/19/opinion/19jdgoogle-sub/19jdgoogle-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=34cc84975f27cd8578d41d56866669398f2743d286a92191fb580e56984a9c0c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Google is investing $550 million in the Chinese online retailer JD.com.

Automobiles,The Horseless eCarriage Is an Option for a Horse-Free Central Park,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/26/automobiles/the-horseless-ecarriage-is-an-option-for-a-horse-free-central-park.html,"The nine-passenger Horseless eCarriage, Mr. Wenig's interpretation of what could be Central Park's open-topped runabout, is on display at the New York auto show. It is absolutely massive. The passenger compartment appears to be roughly the same size as those on the several dozen carriages in the Central Park carriage fleet. But the rest of the vehicle, which is a one-off creation, is sized to scale, resulting in a machine that according to Mr. Wenig, weighs 7,500 pounds loaded and is the same length as a Ford Excursion.

The eCarriage is charged through a port where an early 20th century car's starting crank would be, just under the ""radiator."" A large rubber bulb to the driver's left is the car's horn. The seats are upholstered in diamond-tufted vinyl, and the dashboard is made of wood. Apart from the floor-mounted car stereo, everything including the steering wheel and the dash gauges looks vintage.

Mr. Wenig said in an email that the eCarriage's 46 kilowatt-hour lithium-iron phosphate battery pack could have a 100-mile range from a six-hour charge. The eCarriage has a top speed of 30 miles per hour, but a GPS sensor would limit the vehicle's speed to five m.p.h. in the park.

The prototype on display at the auto show this week cost about $450,000 to put together, including design and engineering costs, Mr. Wenig said. But he says production models, of which there could eventually be 68 if the eCarriage is selected to replace horse-drawn carriages, would cost roughly $150,000 to $175,000 each.","The 7,500-pound Horseless eCarriage, which was displayed at the New York auto show, was conceived as a potential replacement for horse-drawn carriages.",0d47c7a7-3c33-5105-a389-d089b77fe31c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/26/automobiles/26HORSELESS-image1/26HORSELESS-image1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=ec5e8bff56f1c6ede5a0acf5c792dd2624d07712bd28c46df0359e90dc1f913d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,The Horseless eCarriage.,0d47c7a7-3c33-5105-a389-d089b77fe31c,N24News/imgs/0d47c7a7-3c33-5105-a389-d089b77fe31c.jpg,23
Media,Marvel Studios Unveils Diverse Film Lineup at Comic-Con,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/20/business/media/marvel-film-lineup-comic-con.html,"Kevin Feige, the president of Marvel Studios, helped announce its new slate of films on Saturday. They include ""Black Widow,"" in which Scarlett Johansson will reprise her role as a spy and super-assassin from earlier Marvel films like ""Captain America: Civil War.""

LOS ANGELES -- Marvel Studios has generated more than $22 billion in global ticket sales since 2008. Its 23 movies during that period have turned minor comic-book characters like Iron Man and Rocket Raccoon into cultural touchstones. Even ""Ant-Man"" was a hit. But for months Marvel played coy with fans, not to mention rival studios and Wall Street, about its future projects. On Saturday night, the studio finally unveiled what is coming next: a slate of interconnected movies and streaming-service shows that emphasizes diversity on both sides of the camera. The lineup includes the first openly L.G.B.T.Q. superhero in a Marvel film, a superhero who is disabled, and a film anchored by an Asian superhero. The films and TV shows will either push Marvel further into the stratosphere or at long last reveal the studio's limitations. Until now, Kevin Feige, Marvel's fanboy in chief, has focused almost entirely on movies. But the Walt Disney Company, which owns Marvel, is now counting on him to also make must-watch shows for its Disney Plus streaming service, which is scheduled to go live on Nov. 12.

And he will have to do it without some of Marvel's most popular characters, including Iron Man and the Hulk, who are taking much-needed rests. Mr. Feige announced Marvel's new projects during an evening presentation at Comic-Con International, an annual fan convention in San Diego that attracts 140,000 people. Scarlett Johansson will headline ""Black Widow,"" reprising her role as a spy and superassassin from earlier Marvel films like ""Captain America: Civil War."" Fans have long pressed Marvel to give the character her own movie (and sell more related merchandise). ""Black Widow,"" directed by Cate Shortland, will be released in theaters in May. Angelina Jolie, Kumail Nanjiani, Salma Hayek, Brian Tyree Henry and Richard Madden will star in ""The Eternals,"" a film scheduled for November 2020. It will focus on mysterious immortals, one of whom is deaf. The movie's director, Chloe Zhao, is Chinese and known for little-seen art films like ""The Rider,"" which collected $2.4 million worldwide last year.

Marvel will also seek to replicate its theatrical success with ""Black Panther,"" which featured a majority black cast, by adding a standout Asian superhero to its cinematic universe. ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" will star a Chinese-Canadian actor, Simu Liu, in the title role. Awkwafina will join him in the film, which is scheduled to be released in theaters in February 2021. ""Shang-Chi"" is being directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, the Japanese-American filmmaker known for the 2013 indie film ""Short Term 12.""

Marvel's coming slate also includes ""Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" (May 2021) and ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" (November 2021). In a major twist, Natalie Portman will return to the ""Thor"" series as a female version of the god of thunder. The fourth ""Thor"" installment will also find Tessa Thompson reprising her role as Valkyrie; Ms. Thompson confirmed during the Comic-Con presentation that her character will have a lesbian narrative.

* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""As new king, she needs to find her queen,"" Ms. Thompson said. ""That will be the first order of business."" Mr. Feige said he was also working on a new version of the vampire thriller ""Blade,"" this time starring Mahershala Ali, and a new ""Fantastic Four"" movie, along with ""Captain Marvel 2,"" ""Black Panther 2"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3."" Those films are expected to start arriving in 2022. If not king of the world, Mr. Feige at least became the king of Hollywood over the weekend: Disney said that Marvel's ""Avengers: Endgame,"" as expected, would squeak past James Cameron's ""Avatar"" by Sunday to become the highest-grossing film of all time at the worldwide box office, not adjusting for inflation. ""Avatar"" collected $2.79 billion by the end of its run a decade ago, or $3.3 billion in today's money. ""The astonishing achievements of both of these films are ongoing proof of the power of movies to move people,"" Alan F. Horn, co-chairman and chief creative officer of Walt Disney Studios, said in a statement. Mr. Horn cannot brag too much about dethroning ""Avatar"": It became part of the Disney empire in the spring with the completion of a $71.3 billion deal to buy most of Rupert Murdoch's entertainment assets, and four sequels are on the way. The next batch of Marvel movies -- Phase 4 in the studio's vernacular, with ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" wrapping up the previous phase -- will feature story lines that overtly extend to smaller screens, a first for Mr. Feige's operation. Until now, Marvel-branded TV shows like ""Jessica Jones"" and ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" have been made by a lesser Marvel division.","The studio's upcoming slate includes the first openly L.G.B.T.Q. superhero in a Marvel film, a superhero who is disabled, and a film anchored by an Asian superhero.",91030044-d6a7-5436-9f40-3f56584fd39e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/22/multimedia/21marvel-print/20marvel-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=f5249d7ec9bdab5156158460f24c4d7a3488ec7a0f7c243b247b6033c89dfee3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Kevin Feige, the president of Marvel Studios, helped announce its new slate of films on Saturday.

Sports,Yankees and Mets Glad to Finally Face Someone Other Than Themselves,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/sports/baseball/yankees-mets-preseason-games.html,"Major League Baseball during a pandemic looks like this: A masked hitter smashing a home run, a bottle of hand sanitizer hanging from an umpire's waistband, cardboard cutouts of fans positioned in the seats behind home plate, artificial cheering used after plays that benefited the home team. It was peculiar, but for so many Yankees and Mets players, it was most welcome. Although Saturday and Sunday's exhibitions were preludes to the abbreviated 60-game regular season, which begins on Thursday, both sides had not faced an opponent since March 12 -- the day spring training was shut down because of the coronavirus. In a normal year, crosstown rivals squaring off would add intrigue. But in a world flipped upside down by a pandemic, players were happy to be competing against someone other than their own teammates and inching toward games that count. ""This is one of the days that we were wishing and waiting for during the second off-season,"" the Mets' star first baseman, Pete Alonso, said before his team lost to the Yankees, 9-3, on Saturday night at Citi Field.

The Yankees also won on Sunday night, 6-0, powered by home runs from Aaron Judge (two), Gary Sanchez, Giancarlo Stanton and Luke Voit. Even though the Yankees led through eight and a half innings at home, the teams went ahead and played the bottom of the ninth, as agreed to beforehand. These exhibition games arose out of necessity. The second preseason was originally supposed to be held in Arizona and Florida, the two hubs of spring training. Scheduling games would have been much easier given the proximity of the teams. But because coronavirus cases surged in both states and teams experienced an increase of infections among their players and staff members, Major League Baseball moved summer workouts to clubs' home stadiums. Teams were allowed to play as many intrasquad games as desired, but only three exhibition games against another club were permitted.
* None
* Everyone Loves Ohtani: The Angels' two-way star was a unanimous pick for A.L. M.V.P. and his superfans redefine devotion.
* Phillie Phavorite: Bryce Harper truly committed to Philadelphia and now he's back on top of baseball, winning the N.L. M.V.P.
* Cy Young Winners: Milwaukee's Corbin Burnes and Toronto's Robbie Ray had hit rock bottom before they worked their way up to stardom.
* Baseball Is Stuck in Neutral: The potential of a lockout has a star-studded group of free agents waiting for the dust to settle.
* Free-Agency Tracker: Get the latest updates on signings, contract extensions and trades. The Cleveland Indians took a two-hour ride -- and dealt with a broken-down bus -- to Pittsburgh to face the Pirates on Saturday. The Philadelphia Phillies played the Nationals in Washington on Saturday, hosted the Baltimore Orioles on Sunday and will face the Yankees on Monday evening in the Bronx. Other teams had to get on a plane: the Houston Astros to Kansas City, Mo., and the Miami Marlins to Atlanta. The most remote team, though -- the Seattle Mariners -- had only intrasquad contests on tap. The farthest the Yankees had to travel for their three games: Queens on Saturday.

As a few players did on Saturday, Yankees Manager Aaron Boone skipped the team bus and drove himself and his bench coach, Carlos Mendoza, to Citi Field. The routine was unlike a normal Mets-Yankees game: There was a temperature check before entering the stadium, masks were required indoors, every other locker stall was empty in the visitors' clubhouse and a canopy was erected behind each dugout so reserve players could watch with more distancing. ""It was a little bit different, but exciting at the same time: We're finally playing another team,"" Yankees third baseman Gio Urshela said.

Both teams saw these exhibition games as equally useful on and off the field. There are 113 pages of new M.L.B. regulations unique to the 2020 season, so these games were a trial run for hosting a visiting team. And while teammates may offer feedback, opponents raise the stakes. ""I felt like I was overthrowing, but that was to be expected facing a different team,"" said Yankees pitcher Zack Britton, who allowed one run in one inning on Saturday. ""It was good to finally get that feeling of getting some adrenaline in that way so it's not brand-new when we open up the regular season."" One player who could benefit from facing opponents: infielder D.J. LeMahieu, the Yankees' best all-around player last season. He joined the team on Friday after the Yankees announced on July 4 that he had tested positive for the coronavirus while at home in Michigan. He said he took nearly a dozen tests before he finally notched the consecutive negative results at least 24 hours apart mandated by M.L.B. for a return. He said he never had any symptoms.

For those who played on Saturday, it was a useful tuneup. Rick Porcello, the Mets' starting pitcher, gave up three runs over five innings, including a two-run, second-deck blast to Yankees outfielder Clint Frazier, one of the few players to don a face covering during the game. ""None of us -- you guys, us players or really, I think, anybody -- knew how it was going to work once we got to camp,"" Porcello said. ""Each day that's gone by, it seems to be rolling smoother and smoother -- knock on wood. Now we get to this point where we're playing against other teams and in a couple of days we'll get into a regular season. It's exciting just because of the unknowns coming into this season.""

Vying for a spot on the Yankees' opening day roster, Michael King, a rookie, surrendered just one run over four innings on Saturday. The Mets committed four errors, two by third baseman Max Moroff. During a sequence in the sixth inning in which three straight balls were hit to him, the artificial cheering was inadvertently played when he threw wide of first base. King said he did not mind the fake crowd noise. He was initially taken aback, though, by the several hundred cardboard cutouts of Mets fans behind the plate, calling them ""a little weird."" But he quickly forgot about them as he focused on the opposing hitters. Britton said he actually liked the cutouts. ""I guarantee you if fans were out there, I would definitely be a little bit more pumped up and have a little bit more adrenaline,"" King said. ""But still, pitching against another team was all the adrenaline I needed.""",Exhibition games replaced practices and intrasquad scrimmages as the New York teams prepared for the start of their regular-season schedule later this week.,e16ec5e6-f277-5c9d-8017-2defbc777561,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/19/sports/19yankees-top-sub/merlin_174716325_681d31dc-0ccc-477e-ad7b-d0e93762385f-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=2a7aee8c46086bcf93ec028c855373e8a09673e86b4e6cdeffafd27fa8a70dc2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Playing in front of cutouts, Yankees outfielder Clint Frazier, one of the few players to wear a face covering in the preseason game on Saturday, hit a home run in the fourth inning at Citi Field.",e16ec5e6-f277-5c9d-8017-2defbc777561,N24News/imgs/e16ec5e6-f277-5c9d-8017-2defbc777561.jpg,9

The driver would still get the truck started and merge it onto the highway, but then the truck would drive itself, Mercedes said.

Style,An Early YouTube Star Grows Up,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/style/ricky-dillon-playlist-live.html,"ORLANDO, Fla. -- For the past 10 years, Ricky Dillon, 27, has documented every major moment of his life on YouTube. He started posting videos when he was a junior in high school -- funny music parodies at first, then more personal stuff. The concept of a YouTube star was still in its infancy; his peers who knew about his channel bullied him. ""Back then you made videos for no one,"" Mr. Dillon said. ""People didn't get it."" By the end of 2010, he had amassed 50,000 followers; in 2012, the count was up to about 200,000. That year, he and six of his internet friends started Our Second Life (O2L), a collaborative YouTube channel. They had watched each other's videos from afar -- Minnesota, Texas, California, Alabama -- and thought that together they could build a much bigger following. The boys moved into a sprawling home in Los Angeles in 2013, paving the way for collab houses like the Team 10 house, 1600 Vine and Hype House, and embarked on a 19-city tour across America the following year. Thousands of fans came out to meet them. The group won a Teen Choice Award. Their subscriber count spiked to 2.5 million.

""Back then being a YouTuber was still so new, it didn't seem so stable,"" Mr. Dillon said. In the years after, several early top creators quit YouTube, burned out or changed careers. After O2L disbanded in December 2014, Mr. Dillon reinvented himself. He released 20 original songs, a music video with Snoop Dogg, a memoir and a card game called Ricky Dillon's Twisted Truth or Dare. He also kept posting videos to his personal channel, taking part in viral challenges and recounting hilarious stories from his daily life. More recent times have been tough, he sad, noting that 2018 and 2019 ""were dark years for me."" Mr. Dillon had financed his music videos himself and spent carelessly, eventually landing in financial trouble. ""I hired a team to pay my taxes in 2015, and I was under the impression they were being paid,"" he said. ""I don't know what happened, but three years rolled by and I hadn't paid. All of the sudden I had to pay all these taxes off.""

Just days before arriving at Playlist, Mr. Dillon came out to his fans in an emotional video. Brandy Smith, 18, said she was inspired by his authenticity on social media. ""His confidence made me think how much confidence I could have,"" she said. At the convention, Mr. Dillon assumed the role of sage elder. According to the event's organizers, 70 percent of the creators in attendance were first-timers, many of them newly TikTok famous. For Mr. Dillon, Playlist was one in a long line of public appearances. ""A couple years ago I started to feel like, am I going to get too old for this?"" he said. ""But people like Shane Dawson are paving the way for older people."" Mr. Dawson, 31, has been a mainstay on YouTube since 2008 and is one of the most prolific YouTubers working today.

Aside from a stint in retail -- he was a sales associate at PacSun in high school -- Mr. Dillon has never had a traditional job. However, maintaining momentum in the online video world can be cutthroat. Some influencers start fights or engage in cruel pranks for views. Mr. Dillon has steered clear of controversy and become somewhat thrifty. In addition to running his YouTube channel, Mr. Dillon has recently taken on a part-time job editing videos for the 20-year-old Dolan Twins, which helps him pay the bills. ""When you stare at your own face for eight hours, it's hard,"" he said. ""When I edit for them, it's fresh material. It's not myself. It's a new way to be creative."" He lives on a quiet street with a roommate, his dog and a pet pig. Between shooting and editing, he works out and binge-watches TV. Mr. Dillon said he's finally feeling positive about the future for the first time in a while. The money from editing has freed him up, so he doesn't have to upload or post when he doesn't feel like it. He wants to release new music. He's been experimenting with TikTok. But he no longer feels the need to keep up with the latest thing. Throughout the conference, while most of the attendees were glued to their screens, he posted only one photograph to Instagram. In it, he is surrounded by flowers with a slight smile on his face. ""I used to feel really pressured to post the whole weekend,"" Mr. Dillon said. ""Now I just enjoy the ride.""","Ricky Dillon started his channel in high school, when video creators were niche entertainers.

Your Money,Technology's Impact on the Value of Financial Advice,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/13/your-money/technologys-impact-on-the-value-of-financial-advice.html,"WE use technological shortcuts for things from simple tasks like booking vacations and buying books to more consequential matters like searching for a new home or trying to diagnose our ailments. But is the technology good enough to replace guidance from financial advisers? Or is technology actually good for advisers because they can use it to do their jobs better? Several new reports look at what technology will mean for an adviser, who, at his or her best, protects people from their worst investment ideas. And that brings up a corollary question: What will this trend, and enormous investment, in technology mean for the clients, the people whose money is at stake? It seems almost heretical to propose that technology will not make a service better. But after reading the reports and talking to advisers who have embraced technology, I was not sure that this emphasis was going to be better for clients.

The report from Accenture looked at how younger clients sought relationships through technology and how advisers had to be available to provide it. ""When we talk to firms, they think social media is a new thing, and they're trying to control the risk of it,"" said Alex Pigliucci, global managing director of the wealth and asset management business at Accenture. ""I see these tools as an advantage today. They're not something to plan for in the next five to 10 years."" ""The Out-of-Sync Advisor,"" a report by Deloitte, imagined technology bringing clients who were managing their own money back to advisers and then allowing those advisers to give people with a couple of hundred thousand dollars the type of high-quality advice reserved for people with hundreds of millions of dollars. Ed Tracy, leader of the wealth management and private banking practice at Deloitte, said this would be possible only if all the clients' financial information was already in the system so the advisers could spend their time together talking about the clients' goals. Fidelity's annual broker and adviser sentiment index, released late last year, tried to put a dollar amount on all of this: technology-adept advisers who were focused on clients in their 30s and 40s managed, on average, $8 million more than colleagues focused on baby boomers. Their clients also had slightly larger accounts. (Not in the data was how technology contributed directly to this.)

But is there any practical value to investors in this push for more technology? In some areas, yes. In others, it remains to be seen. Patrick O'Connor, senior vice president for wealth, retirement, portfolio solutions at Raymond James, said some of the best technological innovations reminded him of a recent visit to his new dentist. Instead of pointing to a murky X-ray and telling him to floss, his dentist wheeled around a monitor that showed his teeth -- and the problems with them -- from various angles. A bit more brushing here and flossing there, and the image changed to show healthier teeth. ""She was giving me more ownership of my teeth,"" Mr. O'Connor said. ""I've been much more diligent about flossing and paying attention to those areas. Before, I would have ignored her. I'd been lectured to for 10 years."" Technology, he said, can do much the same thing for investors, showing them how they are doing and the consequences of their spending and saving. The technology also becomes the bearer of bad news, not the adviser. ""Instead of saying, 'Sorry you're in the red,' I become the facilitator in getting you from the red to the green,"" he said. And technology can help clients reduce mundane and time-consuming tasks and increase the amount of time they can talk about the things that matter most to them. ""If someone had my data, understood my goals, had buckets in my portfolio and I knew if I was on track or off track and they only spent three hours a year with me, I'd feel a lot better than I would with someone I sat down with who said, 'Tell me what's going on,' "" Mr. Tracy said.

Yet when it comes to social media, it is easier to see how technology could go awry. My first worry was an adviser sending off a Twitter post after a night on the town; my second was an investor acting on that post. Firms worry about that, too. Mr. O'Connor said a compliance officer checks advisers' comments before they are posted. Angie Herbers, who runs a research and consulting firm named after her that is aimed at independent advisers, said that she was not convinced that social media brought in more clients and that they could be more of a liability to established clients. ""The risk is you can imply something that you don't wish to imply to clients or future clients,"" Ms. Herbers said. ""Let's say you tweet out a great article and some of your clients read it. You have no control over how they react to it."" Advisers, she said, ""are on social media to educate clients or potential clients, but I believe they're creating more stress than anything else."" Mr. Pigliucci disagreed, arguing that social media could help clients understand more complicated products on their own time. ""If it's really working well, it's more than some tweets and Facebook postings,"" he said. ""If the adviser sends a message and then says, 'Here's a link that discusses the strategy I'm talking about,' and you can look at it and think about it a bit more, it's interacting using online education."" Still, many firms are transfixed by the prospect of technology bringing in more and younger clients. Do social media help the actual clients, both the younger ones that firms are going after and the older ones who presumably have more money?

Mitchell S. Rock, a senior vice president at Morgan Stanley, was in the first group that the company allowed to use social media in 2011. He said it had been an additional marketing tool for his group, though it had not replaced in-person meetings or even cold calling. ""We don't use Twitter because we're limited to sound bites,"" he said. ""LinkedIn has been very effective. It allows you to position yourself and drive prospects from your LinkedIn account to your Web site to your desk."" He said some of his success in using social media was tied to the narrowness of his practice, which was easy to pitch: it is focused on owners of privately held middle-market companies who are about to sell the companies. And while social media have been good to him, Mr. Rock was measured on their usefulness to clients. ""Social media has allowed us to cast a wider net and get in front of our target market, but it's still important to have a strong idea to deliver,"" he said. In other words, it is good for clients to hear about advisers with a specialty that could help them. But they still need to be just as vigilant as they always were in vetting those advisers. Investors who fear what technology could do to their financial plan can take some comfort in the fact that their meetings with an adviser -- at least for people with enough money -- are likely to continue for a while. People with less to invest may have to settle for a video chat on their computer. But whether this push into technology is going to make the advice better is debatable. Ms. Herbers likened the rush to adopt technology to watching a football game when people start to stand. ""Sometimes at a football game, if someone in front of you stands up, you can still see perfectly well if you look around him,"" she said. But if everyone else is on their feet, ""you feel foolish if you don't stand up."" Remember that the next time your adviser tries to wow you with some new technology, and ask if it will change the outcome of the game.","Financial advisers are putting greater emphasis on technology, but it is unclear whether that is better for their clients.",143363da-7e4c-5ae6-964d-bfe6fdba00a3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/04/13/your-money/13wealth/13wealth-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=36075d1d1d0b0b81823dc41a143cab101798971f05e5f60b07b5a0bff5988985&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Mitchell S.

Movies,Claire Denis Talks to Barry Jenkins About Director Anxiety and Expectations,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/movies/claire-denis-barry-jenkins.html,"Claire Denis, the world's greatest working filmmaker, is sitting on a couch drinking herbal tea. She is in New York promoting her new film, ""High Life,"" an emphatic allegory about infants, incarceration and intergalactic space travel starring Robert Pattinson as one of several young convicts conscripted to a mission to a black hole. Denis, born in Paris but raised in West Africa by civil servant parents, is an auteur's auteur, uncompromising in her vision and singular in aesthetic styling. Hers is a cinema of everyday rituals, personal histories and a knotty reckoning with the lingering effects of colonialist aggressions. A longtime fan and student of her work, I spoke by Skype with Denis, now 72, about anxiety, ""High Life"" and the keen ways in which she portrays the lives and souls of black folks on screen.

BARRY JENKINS How are you, Claire? CLAIRE DENIS I'm fine. Actually, I don't know. I am a little bit tired, a little bit full of anxiety, and yet, I am happy to speak with you. JENKINS And I am happy to speak with you. The anxiety, I understand. The movie's opening, right? I would imagine you get used to it. DENIS Oh, no. It's worse and worse. DENIS Yeah, because there is a sort of innocence at the very beginning. At least I did that, you know? And what if I never do another one? Then little by little, it became people are expecting something. I think it's worse, yes. JENKINS I was [at the Toronto International Film Festival, where the film debuted] and I think there were expectations. People had heard this movie is crazy. But it wasn't this very wild, far-out thing. It was just your work. DENIS I think my movies have a certain tenderness, a certain humanity, and that's what counts for me.

JENKINS I would agree. It's why I love your work. Whenever people say there's tenderness in my work, I say thank you, Claire, Denis. DENIS Oh, come on. I mean thank you, thank you for people to believe in making films with that content. I loved your last film. JENKINS Thank you very much. You [said you] were uncomfortable speaking in English, but I remember the first time I heard your voice, it was in English, and it had a very profound effect on me because you were so thoughtful in your answers. DENIS I think I am also slow in my thoughts. I'm not fast, even in French. JENKINS Is it something that you've discovered through your work? Or is just the way you grew up? You have a very interesting background, and clearly it's created a person who makes art in a way that's very different than the way the rest of us make art. DENIS I think so. Growing [up] in Africa at the end of the colonial era was so much for a child to grasp. I try to understand my parents, the people, the other white people, and I try to understand what it was to be watching this moment where [freedom movements] wanted the end of colony, you know? It was very naive probably, but I thought, well, things are getting better. And my parents, especially my father, he was very optimistic, and he was so much for the freedom of Africa, I think it gave us a freedom to think, a freedom to be independent, not to be so French.

But when I get to France when I was 13, 14, I realized I was completely different. I had been educated for a different life. I could not be like my cousin, like my friend, but maybe I felt unfit for so many things in France. And therefore, cinema became a reason to live and to express my feelings. JENKINS You mentioned the optimism of your father, because I think, especially in your work that's set in Africa, there is this tension between the hope for what things could be and the reality of how things are. I would say, as a black filmmaker, my friends and I talk about the work you've made that's set on the continent and how something feels very true about it. Part of that's because you have personal experience there, but it just seems like you care, which is a very important thing for an artist. DENIS Not only I care, but I knew, even when I was 3, 4 years old that something was unfair, that this situation was terrible. I knew there was something wrong in being masters among people. This gave me a sort of forever guilt. JENKINS: You returned to France when you were 13, but you didn't make your first film until you were, I think ...

DENIS I had not a very easy youth. I got married. I ran away from home when I was 15. I did a lot of crazy things, but you know, '68 Europe was a sort of vast change. Nothing would be the same ever, so we thought. I became interested in photos. I met someone who told me maybe you should try to go to a cinema school. I spent there three years, and then I divorced. I had to find work, and the headmaster helped me to find a job, and that's how I became an assistant director. I adored that. People always ask me, were you frustrated to be an assistant? No, the opposite. It was great. I wanted so much to be useful. And once or twice, with Jacques Rivette, the French director, he urged me to do my own thing. And in the end, I was with Wim Wenders doing ""Paris, Texas,"" and suddenly, I knew my first film was going to be an evocation of my youth in Africa. Because I thought: If I don't start with ""Chocolat,"" I will be always unbalanced. Something I have to say, it's me, and that's it. JENKINS ""Chocolat"" was the experience of having to express yourself? DENIS Yeah, but I was not expressing myself in the first person. I was trying to express a group of persons, black and white, living under the same roof. For good or bad reasons, I wanted to speak about that guilt, and that moment where this young domestic decides it was over for him to be serving white people. I remember very well some friend of Isaach de Bankole [a star of the film] told him, oh, Isaach, you're not going to play a domestic of white people, it's so humiliating. And I said, no, it's the main part. JENKINS There have been quite a few actors, black actors, in France, in Paris in particular, who have come to fame through your work, Isaach being one -- Alex Descas being another. Talk about working with those black men. I assume that feels no different than working with anyone else, but it is a very particular thing because, in French cinema, those actors don't typically get roles that are very central.

JENKINS I want to shift and talk about time. The way you structure your films, it's very provocative to me. I have failed at trying to understand how you structure your films at times, and there are things I've written but I will never make because I was trying too hard to try to understand. ""High Life"" is about the longest span of time that anyone could possibly try to undertake in a film, but then the first film of yours that I saw, ""Friday Night,"" is about one of the shortest spans, and they both come from the same mind. So, I'm curious. How does Claire Denis approach time? DENIS In terms of writing a script, I have to figure out moments, and if I see a moment that is fulfilled, I think, now I can start writing because at least I have this moment, and I know this moment will be a sort of sample of what the film should be made of. I tried to make diagrams -- this happened the day before, and this -- but it never worked because it's abstract. I need to feel those moments, and sometimes, maybe right or wrong, I don't need to say this moment takes place yesterday. I just go on, piece by piece like a wall, and it gives me, not freedom, but a sort of emotion that I will be able -- when I'm shooting -- to be inside the scene and not outside that moment.

It's weird to explain it like that. JENKINS It's perfect. It should be weird because I've seen most of your work, and I'm still wrestling with it. In [""High Life""] you can send anyone into space, and yet you choose these kids whom society has discarded. There is something there very profound and emotional [in] this idea that Robert's character rehabilitates himself and becomes this father, and yet he can't return. It seems like a very political, activist thing. Did you know that going in? Or was it just about the character? DENIS I cannot stand [the] death penalty. This is, for me, so inhuman. I understand if someone shoots another person, but to organize a society where you have people that are waiting to be [executed], this cruelty, it's so unnecessary because it doesn't make the world better. JENKINS I wanted to switch and talk about young people like my friend, Amy Seimetz, a wonderful filmmaker. Then I met you at the Safdie brothers screening of ""Good Time"" at Cannes [a film that also stars Pattinson]. How does it feel to know that all of us young filmmakers admire you and take such strength from your work? Do you feel a responsibility maybe? DENIS Of course not. I am proud that people, let's take Mati Diop [an actress in ""35 Shots of Rum""], for instance, the fact that she called me to say the film is finished. Of course, she did it all. She doesn't need me, but I felt, this is something I'm proud of. Not because I'm a woman and she's a young woman, no. It's because I know what she wants to do, and I am proud of that. JENKINS Yes, and you should be proud. I want you to own this, because when I had lunch with Mati, she told me you programmed her short film [during an American tour Denis did], and she said it meant so much to her. So I think you're an inspiration. You should accept it. DENIS No, I accept it. I lost my mother [in 2017], and life is so short; it disappears just like that. To be showing Mati's film, it's a good thing I've done in my life.

JENKINS Among a few other good things. You know, when I made my first film, ""Medicine for Melancholy"" [about a would-be young couple in San Francisco], it has a piece of score from ""Friday Night"" in it. And I remember talking to [the composer Dickon Hinchliffe], and Dickon said, you can have the song but Claire has to approve it. And this is before ""Moonlight."" You said yes. This little guy, you can have the song, and you know nobody's ever going to see that film. A few people have seen it, but not many. DENIS You can have any song from me. Me, I own nothing. I hate the idea.","The French filmmaker's approach to time and structure has long fascinated our interviewer, the American auteur of ""Moonlight.""",cc5c91ed-effe-5a8b-b53f-69c807bb95d3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/28/arts/28jenkins-denis/28jenkins-denis-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=92f50ac5f8e2a4631c020049af2454f3c453f7c48fd18c54dcf1a50a77d21563&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""I think my movies have a certain tenderness, a certain humanity, and that's what counts for me,"" said Claire Denis, director of the film ""High Life.""",cc5c91ed-effe-5a8b-b53f-69c807bb95d3,N24News/imgs/cc5c91ed-effe-5a8b-b53f-69c807bb95d3.jpg,5

Books,Can American Jews Be Both Liberal and Pro-Israel?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/books/review/can-american-jews-be-both-liberal-and-pro-israel.html,"It was with great interest that I read Hillel Halkin's review of Bari Weiss's ""How to Fight Anti-Semitism"" (Sept. 29). Halkin writes with characteristic clarity, force and knowledge, and I concur with his judgment that her book is a ""brave"" one in the current political and cultural climate. Her stance as a ""proud Jew and lover of Israel"" is one that I, like Halkin, applaud.

However, I find his ""disappointment"" and critique of Weiss's identification with the liberal values that dominate the contemporary American Jewish community rather narrowly construed historically. The alliance between Jews in the modern Western world and political liberalism predates the 19th century and German reform and unquestionably has its origins in the writings of Baruch Spinoza and Moses Mendelssohn that called for separation between religion and state during the 17th and 18th centuries. These stances were part and parcel of Enlightenment thought and allowed for a neutral or at least semineutral public sphere to emerge that permitted the political emancipation of the Jews. Virtually all modern religious and secular Jews applauded this development. It was a stance that was born both out of one reading of a multivalent Jewish tradition that championed such values and of a self-interested Jewish judgment that such liberal values were in the best interests of the Jewish community. Many if not most American Jews -- including Weiss and myself -- still believe this to be the case.

Indeed, in championing a liberal reading of Jewish tradition, Weiss and other American Jews are allowing values of the larger culture to inform their reading of the tradition no less than Jews have for thousands of years. As the historian Gerson D. Cohen pointed out in his memorable 1966 commencement address, ""The Blessing of Assimilation in Jewish History,"" Jews throughout history have ""assimilated"" teachings from the surrounding world to inform their own understanding of an ever-evolving Judaism.

This was true when the Bible employed the political lexicon of the ancient Near East to describe the relationship between a sovereign and his subjects and transformed the Akkadian word biritu (clasp or fetter) into the Hebrew term berit (covenant) to describe the relationship between God and the Jewish people, or when the medieval philosopher Moses Maimonides internalized and applied the teachings of Aristotle to explicate the nature of Judaism to his contemporaries.

Dance,"Under a Shiny Shroud, Cloaked in Mystery",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/05/arts/dance/luciana-achugars-otro-teatro-focuses-on-the-body.html,"""Otro Teatro,"" the Spanish title of Luciana Achugar's latest work, translates as ""other theater"" or ""another theater,"" with the possible connotation of an alternative one. The New York premiere on Wednesday took place in the conventional setting of the theater at New York Live Arts, but Ms. Achugar has some unconventional notions of what might transpire there for performers and audience. A handout suggests a project ""to grow ourselves a new body,"" ""a utopian body,"" ""an anarchic body, ""a body in pleasure.""

There is no set; no sounds, save for those made by the body. The piece begins with a body, Ms. Achugar's, shrouded in a fabric like shiny burlap, moaning. The moaning builds to chanting, and her rocking on her knees rises into a circling around the floor. This ritual action repeats, and the work as a whole shares this loose-fitting shape of escalating and subsiding. It lasts more than two hours.

It's hard to say more while honoring Ms. Achugar's request that critics not divulge surprises. To anyone familiar with her work, it hardly counts as a surprise that she is naked beneath the shroud, her hair unkempt, her skin streaked with red. But without revealing too much, perhaps I could offer some advice to viewers accustomed to conventional theatergoing: When the people around you start moaning, don't shush them.

To put it another way, there are several reasons the number of empty seats in the audience keeps increasing. This much seems essential to hint at, since audience experience is key to the work's ambitions and its problems. Your reaction to the moaning is a crucial test. Do you think ""I'll have what she's having"" or, as I did, ""Get me out of here""?","Luciana Achugar is bringing her ""Otro Teatro,"" which proposes growing a new body, to New York Live Arts.",0493bfc2-9fc7-5d8f-86f4-aa76e74f98ca,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/05/arts/05OTRO/05OTRO-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=401&w=600&s=bd88696ebcf07a7cd94b6d3f7bbf8e1809a206033a765a68debcad484fe0c7d6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Otro Teatro Luciana Achugar in her latest work at New York Live Arts, where she goes from covered to nude.",0493bfc2-9fc7-5d8f-86f4-aa76e74f98ca,N24News/imgs/0493bfc2-9fc7-5d8f-86f4-aa76e74f98ca.jpg,6
Food,Sous-Vide Gefilte Fish? A Chef's Argentine-Jewish Cuisine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/dining/argentina-chef-tomas-kalika-jewish-food.html,"The chef Tomas Kalika of Mishiguene, the first Jewish fine-dining restaurant in Buenos Aires, among the ashes of dinner on a visit to Brooklyn. He's about to open a second place in Buenos Aires, Fayer, unifying Argentine open-fire grilling and Jewish cuisine.

When the Argentine chef Tomas Kalika opened his restaurant Mishiguene in 2014, he had a recurring dream. More like a nightmare, really. Mishiguene (crazy in Yiddish), which sits by a sprawling park in Buenos Aires, was the city's first restaurant to serve traditional Jewish foods in a tasting menu. Mr. Kalika called it immigrant cuisine, and he knew what a few of his diners were thinking -- that his version of gefilte fish poached sous-vide, and his darling varenikes, were a little too cheffy.

In it, a man shouted that Mr. Kalika's varenikes were terrible, inedible garbage. Just who did Mr. Kalika think he was, anyway? Then, in case the dream's message wasn't clear, Mr. Kalika's grandmother appeared and smashed some plates to the ground. The psychiatrist advised him to put a note on the menu, to acknowledge that his varenikes weren't in competition with anyone's grandmother's. So Mr. Kalika added a disclaimer (""Bubbie's are better,"" it began) and carried on serving his tender thin-skinned dumplings, filled with potato and topped with gribenes, chicken skin and onion that have been slowly crisped in chicken fat and freckled with black pepper.

The dining room filled up, and Mr. Kalika's anxieties subsided. He is feeling much more confident now: In March, he plans to open Fayer, his second restaurant in Buenos Aires. Argentina, home to one of the largest Jewish populations in the world, is his inspiration. At Fayer, he will cook more of what he sees as an emerging Argentine-Jewish cuisine -- multicultural Jewish influences from across the diaspora, unified by the open-fire grilling and wood smoke that define Argentine cooking.

""The idea is also to recreate how Jewish people have used wood for cooking,"" Mr. Kalika said. This could mean serving dishes traditionally grilled in a Middle Eastern mangal, an Italian spiedo or even a basic cast-iron caldron. Mr. Kalika also wants to explore the foods of Jewish communities in Ethiopia and Iraq, which often go underrepresented. ""Jewish cuisine is global,"" Mr. Kalika said as he tended to a rack of short ribs on a recent trip to New York. The beef had been brined for a week with sugar and spices, including coriander seeds and star anise, then smoked. The ribs were transferred to a pot with wine and stock, sandwiched between flames in a multilayered Argentine grill, the heat licking it from above and below. The pot simmered for hours, until all of that marvelous pink-edged meat pulled away from the bones.

Mr. Kalika also flipped whole eggplants on the coals, searing them until they collapsed inward and it was easy to wipe away their charred skins. At Mishiguene, he serves these creamy eggplants intact, with a tahini sauce and a tomato sauce, like a bowl of chopped baba ghanouj that has somehow been pieced back together. Mr. Kalika, who shaves his glossy head clean, has a warm, TV-ready smile and an earnest love for the food he cooks. Holding a peeled eggplant with both hands as if it were a newborn baby, he gazed down on it and beamed.

""It's just so beautiful, no?"" he said. Mr. Kalika, 37, grew up in the northernmost neighborhood of Buenos Aires in a middle-class Jewish family with roots in Russia and Poland. At 17, he says, he was a particularly aimless sort of teenager. His interests were limited to the guitar and watching the charismatic chef Carlos Alberto Dumas, better known as Gato Dumas, on television. As Argentina experienced an economic depression in the late 1990s, Mr. Kalika's mother sent him to Israel, hoping the trip would set him on a new course, any course. Mr. Kalika worked for a while as a dishwasher on a kibbutz and quickly took to kitchen life, eventually cooking for the Israeli chef Eyal Shani before returning home, charged with new ideas. Mr. Shani, who had helped propel the whole-roasted cauliflower to international fame, deeply influenced Mr. Kalika as a young chef. He makes his own version of the dish now, poaching the cauliflower in milk until it almost falls apart, then letting it cool overnight in the liquid.

This is how the cauliflower is served at Mishiguene, where every Friday night, a band lights up the dining room with klezmer, the Eastern European folk music passed down through generations, across oceans. Though the restaurant does not serve kosher food, the whirling, joyful mood during Friday dinners is that of an unconventional Shabbat. There is often drinking and dancing and roars of applause, and when the music is over, the band sits down. ""They refuse to let me pay them,"" said Mr. Kalika, who has tried and failed to put the musicians on his payroll. Instead, every Friday night, the men just show up. And every Friday night, Mr. Kalika saves them a table and fills it with plates of hot varenikes.","Tomás Kalika, who will soon open his second Buenos Aires restaurant, is giving diaspora cooking a tasting-menu (and Argentine) twist.",601bbfb0-fe32-5326-8db1-b8f9c91e5e60,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/22/dining/22JEWISH2/22JEWISH2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=d4643f230ed49c904992f8485f948e6d8d29e944da4eb17c95a8d54b8f3db4af&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The chef Tomás Kalika of Mishiguene, the first Jewish fine-dining restaurant in Buenos Aires, among the ashes of dinner on a visit to Brooklyn.

Media,Ellen DeGeneres Returns to Show With Apology for Toxic Workplace,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/21/business/media/ellen-degeneres-show.html,"Ellen DeGeneres started the 18th season of her daytime talk show on Monday with a lengthy apology that addressed reports describing her as a boss who led a toxic workplace. ""If you're watching because you love me, thank you,"" Ms. DeGeneres said in her return from a summer hiatus. ""And if you're watching because you don't love me, welcome."" Dressed in a white blazer, jeans and her signature white sneakers, the host addressed the rows of seats filled with screens that featured virtual audience members. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, audience members are not permitted to enter her Burbank, Calif., studio.

""As you may have heard this summer, there were allegations of a toxic work environment at our show,"" Ms. DeGeneres said. ""And then there was an investigation. I learned that things happen here that never should have happened. I take that very seriously. And I want to say, I am so sorry to the people who were affected. I know that I'm in a position of privilege and power. And I realized that with that comes responsibility, and I take responsibility for what happens at my show.""

In July, BuzzFeed News reported that former employees of ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" said they had experienced ""racism, fear and intimidation"" on the program and were fired after taking time off for medical leave or bereavement. A former Black employee said she was the victim of racist comments from staff members. Warner Bros., the studio that distributes the syndicated program, and its subsidiary, Telepictures, started an internal investigation. In August, three high-level producers were let go: Ed Glavin, an executive producer; Jonathan Norman, a co-executive producer; and Kevin Leman, the head writer.

""The Ellen DeGeneres Show,"" which started in 2003, has been a boon to Warner Bros., which is part of AT&T's WarnerMedia entertainment division. Last year, Ms. DeGeneres signed a contract to keep her at the program through 2022. She also signed a deal to make new shows for HBO Max, the WarnerMedia streaming service. In addition, Ms. DeGeneres is the host of a Warner Bros. game show, ""Ellen's Game of Games,"" a prime-time mainstay for NBC. During the monologue, which was posted on her show's social media accounts, Ms. DeGeneres, 62, referred to ""articles in the press and on social media that said that I am not who I appear to be on TV.""

""The truth is, I am that person that you see on TV,"" she continued. ""I am also a lot of other things. Sometimes I get sad, I get mad, I get anxious, I get frustrated, I get impatient. And I am working on all of that. I am a work in progress."" The on-air apology followed two apologies -- one by email, the other during a videoconference -- that she had made to her staff over the summer. In her remarks on Monday, Ms. DeGeneres, one of the first television stars to announce that she was gay, also referenced how she had spent years of her career as an actress, often playing straight women. ""So, I'm a pretty good actress, but I don't think that I'm that good that I could come out here every day for 17 years and fool you,"" she said. ""This is me. And my intention is to always be the best person I can be. And if I've ever let someone down, if I've ever hurt their feelings, I am so sorry for that."" Ms. DeGeneres introduced Stephen Laurel Boss, the DJ known as tWitch, and noted that he was now a co-executive producer on the show. After a brief chat with him, she told her virtual audience members that she was giving each of them a 65-inch television set.

Theater,"Review: In 'Hurricane Diane,' the Perfect Storm Hits Suburbia",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/theater/hurricane-diane-review.html,"That, at any rate, is the setup for ""Hurricane Diane,"" an astonishing new play by Madeleine George that whirls ancient myth, lesbian pulp, ecological thriller and The Real Housewives of Monmouth County into a perfect storm of timely tragicomedy. Understand that we are talking about a small-g god, Dionysus to be exact; the back story of ""Hurricane Diane"" is ""The Bacchae."" In that Greek drama, you may recall, the lord of wine and ecstasy (and theater) avenges himself on a complacent society that has turned its back on his ecstatic religion. In ""Hurricane Diane,"" which opened on Sunday at New York Theater Workshop in a production directed by Leigh Silverman, the complacent ones are four women living on a cul-de-sac in flood-prone Red Bank, N.J., in four houses with identical floor plans. (One shiny, high-end kitchen, designed by Rachel Hauck, serves as the set for all of them.) Over coffee and giant glasses of Zinfandel, they gather to discuss the latest gossip and ignore the latest portents. Ms. George has fun with these women -- or girls, as they call themselves -- but does not mock them. Rather, with loving attention to sitcom rhythm, she gradually anatomizes the emptiness that animates their ""Golden Girls"" chatter. It is left to the costume designer, Kaye Voyce, to pin them to the wall like butterflies in a natural-history museum.

Wearing Talbots business casuals, Carol (Mia Barron) has the hardest enamel shell; professionally speaking and otherwise, she is ""in compliance."" Pam (Danielle Skraastad) is an Italian dragon in animal prints, obsessed with home security. At the softer end of the spectrum, in creamy Eileen Fisher separates, Renee (Michelle Beck) struggles with being ""the highest-ranking woman of color on the masthead of any shelter magazine in America"" -- a job she suspects may be immoral in its selling of pernicious lifestyle fantasies. And poor Beth (Kate Wetherhead), draped in what appear to be damp handkerchiefs, has just been ghosted by her husband. [What's new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter] Into this backwater of frustration comes Diane (Becca Blackwell) -- Dionysus in modern drag as a landscaper with a longstanding (centuries-old!) interest in permaculture. Her agenda is somewhat at odds with that of her would-be clients. Where Carol imagines a wrought iron accent bench in the backyard, Diane intends a primeval forest of pawpaw and milk vetch. Where Pam sees a little Italian garden with roses and a fountain, like the one in the mural at a nearby restaurant, Diane plans the restoration of the entire North American landmass.

In other words, if the girls think they are treading water emotionally, Diane is there to show them that there is far worse in store. With the ""cosmic clock"" already at 11:45, and storm surges arriving at the Jersey Shore with increasing regularity, they may be treading water for real before long. Their only chance for survival is if Diane can undo what modernity has done to them in turning their rightful maenad madness into mere home-improvement mania.

To reverse this course, she sets out to seduce them each into her cult. This she does literally and handily -- with one holdout. Becca Blackwell, a downtown performer who exists ""between genders,"" is ideally cast as the charismatic pansexual deity, whether rocking a Greek tunic and vegetal tiara or long shorts, wool socks and work boots. As Dionysus's nonbinary energy jangles the wiring of the staid suburbanites, releasing something wild in them, it also unleashes something wild in the play. Indeed, in the second half of its intermissionless 90 minutes, ""Hurricane Diane"" sometimes seems to spin so fast that Ms. Silverman's staging cannot keep up. Though the play is a coproduction with WP Theater, it would need even greater resources to do full credit to the scenes in which ecological revenge and Dionysian frenzy blur into one howling terror. The sound design (by Bray Poor) and haunting original music (by the Bengsons) help patch over the problem; even so, reading the script later, I was surprised to discover I'd totally missed a major plot point near the end. But this does not invalidate the achievement. Ms. Silverman's control of the tone in the first half, along with the hilarious but grounded work of the cast throughout -- Ms. Skraastad needs her own sitcom, pronto -- serves the play's intentions beautifully. Ms. George is not, in any case, a plot-first kind of writer. Rather, she seems to begin with themes and ideas that fall into a kind of rhyming pattern and then make them do somersaults. In ""The (curious case of the) Watson Intelligence,"" a Pulitzer Prize finalist in 2014, she riffed on the coincidence of Sherlock's sidekick, Alexander Graham Bell's assistant and IBM's natural-language computer all sharing the same name. The trick is making it not just a trick. In ""Hurricane Diane,"" commissioned by Two River Theater, itself in Red Bank, she fully succeeds. The various threads of her interest get tied almost excruciatingly tight by the larger disaster she means to discuss. It is not, directly, the disaster of ecocide; she wittily, hopefully defines the play's time period as ""Early Anthropocene"" -- not ""Late."" It's still 11:45, after all.","Madeleine George's new play brings back the god Dionysus to convince the women of Monmouth County, N.J., that the ecological end is near.",19fb3969-b869-54db-90d2-762b85e42b43,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/25/arts/25hurricanepix/25hurricanepix-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=5a31f12e5f2597b28d2c8d9babeb3fa123f3e980b846289f6de1f55b2419a805&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Becca Blackwell, Danielle Skraastad, Kate Wetherhead and Michelle Beck in &ldquo;Hurricane Diane&rdquo; at the New York Theater Workshop.",19fb3969-b869-54db-90d2-762b85e42b43,N24News/imgs/19fb3969-b869-54db-90d2-762b85e42b43.jpg,10

HPV, or human papilloma virus, is a common sexually transmitted disease, and while most cases are harmless, some types of the virus can cause genital warts and cancer.

Researchers reviewed 40 studies of HPV infection in 14 high-income countries, with data from more than 60 million people followed for up to eight years after vaccination. The study is in The Lancet.

They found that the prevalence of HPV 16 and 18, which cause most cases of cervical cancer, decreased over the period by 83 percent among girls ages 13 to 19, and by 66 percent among women 20 to 24.

Global Business,"Companies Shift Top Offices to Asia, Seeking to Crack Markets",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/business/global/companies-shift-top-offices-to-asia-seeking-to-crack-markets.html,"HONG KONG -- Amid ear-splitting clashes of cymbals and drums, a team of lion dancers strutted its stuff on the 34th floor of Citibank Tower last month in a traditional ceremony aimed at bringing good fortune to the office that was being inaugurated there that day. The office is special: Located in one of the most prestigious towers of the central business area in Hong Kong, it now houses the global headquarters of Infiniti, the premium brand of the Japanese auto maker Nissan. Nissan's headquarters are in Yokohama. And Infiniti cars are manufactured in Japan and the United States; two more sites are planned for as yet undisclosed locations in Europe and mainland China. But Nissan's management made a deliberate decision to base Infiniti's brain -- operations like brand strategy, product planning and sales, as well as the chief executive -- in a city that is not a must-be-there location for the automotive sector and where office rents are among the highest in the world. ""The beauty of Hong Kong is that it is a gateway into China,"" and China is the brand's most important growth market, said Andy Palmer, who oversees the luxury business unit at Nissan, explaining the decision to base Infiniti in Hong Kong.

""This is not a cost-reduction or outsourcing exercise,"" he added. In fact, Nissan's decision highlights a broader trend that is gaining momentum across Asia. For years, U.S., European and Japanese companies have been building up blue-collar and back-office operations and representative offices in places like mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore. Now top-level executives are joining them, increasing the amount of quality time they spend in those areas. Take General Electric, the U.S. corporate powerhouse whose products include medical equipment, turbines and locomotives. Last year, John Rice, vice chairman of G.E. and president and chief executive of global growth and operations for the company, relocated with his wife to Hong Kong. The move was ""part substance and part symbolism,"" Mr. Rice said in an interview at his Hong Kong office. ""Being outside the United States makes you smarter about global issues. It lets you see the world through a different lens.""

Mr. Rice had traveled to Asia many times and visited China for the first time in 1989. ""I've come to China close to 100 times,"" he said, ""but I've learned more about China in the last 18 months than I did in the preceding 20 years."" Michael Andrew, who took over as global chairman of KPMG International last October, echoed that sentiment. ""By being here, you demonstrate that you are not just an Anglo-Saxon firm -- it is a visible demonstration of your commitment to the region,"" said Mr. Andrew, who chose to base himself in Hong Kong. Given the amount of traveling he does, Mr. Andrew spends only about 25 percent to 30 percent of his time in the city. Still, even that means ""you become part of the fabric here,"" he said. ""You have regular access to key business leaders, and you are able to talk to them as one of them, rather than as someone who is just passing through.""
* Today in On Tech: Imagine not living in Big Tech's world.
* Dollar Tree will raise prices to $1.25 by the end of April. Another example: Schneider Electric, a French engineering company that derives more than a quarter of its sales from Asia, recently announced that two senior executives would move to Hong Kong. That increases to four the number of managers based in Hong Kong who report directly to the chief executive, Jean-Pascal Tricoire. Mr. Tricoire remains based in Paris, though he spends so much time travelling in Asia that his family has moved to Hong Kong to spend more time with him.

Surveys conducted by the Economist Corporate Network show just how rapidly the trend toward more Asia-based management has accelerated in recent years. In 2008, just 19 percent of non-Asian multinational companies surveyed had one or more board members living and working in Asia. By last year, that figure had reached nearly 30 percent. What is more, 45.3 percent of the respondents in the 2011 survey expected to have board members in the region by 2016. Not so long ago, said Ross O'Brien, director of the Economist Corporate Network's Hong Kong office, the trend was about moving manufacturing to where the growth was. Now, ""it's about globalizing your brand and your thinking,"" Mr. O'Brien said. ""It's hard to make a decision to invest when you are based in a region where belt-tightening is the order of the day,"" he added, so being in Asia helps focus a company's thinking on the region's potential. Hong Kong is not the only beneficiary of the trend. Singapore, too, has attracted an expanding flock of top-level managers and divisional headquarters as companies seek to capitalize on the city-state's highly educated work force. And while Hong Kong is seen as the gateway to mainland China, Singapore is an ideal stepping stone for Southeast Asia and India.

Movies,'Jim Allison: Breakthrough' Review: Taking On Cancer,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/movies/jim-allison-breakthrough-review.html,"Documentaries about innovative figures don't always offer correspondingly innovative filmmaking. But even coloring within the lines of conventional biographical storytelling, ""Jim Allison: Breakthrough"" provides an accessible introduction to James P. Allison, who, along with Tasuku Honjo of Japan, won a Nobel Prize in 2018 for discoveries in cancer immunotherapy.

Allison developed an antibody to keep T-cells, the white blood cells that attack viruses, in attack mode when faced with tumors. The film suggests that the research was personal: Allison's mother died of lymphoma, and a brother's experience of prostate cancer, from which he ultimately died, is chronicled throughout. We are told that Allison raised the prospect of the immune system's cancer-fighting potential at a speech at the Texas Legislature in 1981, when he advocated teaching evolution in the state's schools. (For Allison, who grew up in Texas, that issue was a long-term fight, too.)

The director, Bill Haney, intercuts Allison's story with that of Sharon Belvin, whom Allison says is the first patient he met from the drug trials. The film does a solid job of explaining the barriers -- justified skepticism, professional groupthink, the high cost of long-term research -- that Allison faced in proving that a new kind of treatment could work.",He won a Nobel Prize for his discoveries in immunotherapy.

Yes, Joel Grey is mainly an actor and director, perhaps forever best known for his indelible portrayal of the M.C. in the musical ""Cabaret"" and, most recently for directing the acclaimed Yiddish version of ""Fiddler on the Roof."" But Mr. Grey has also steadily -- and more quietly -- built something of a side career as a photographer over the last 16 years, with his work featured in books, gallery shows and even in the permanent collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art. Mr. Grey, 87, also likes to be around artists and has befriended several -- namely David Hockney, Jim Dine and R.B. Kitaj -- who have encouraged his artwork and sold him some of their own. Mr. Grey recently released his fifth book of photographs, ""The Flower Whisperer,"" published by PowerHouse Books. And he has opened a companion photo exhibition at Staley-Wise Gallery in SoHo. The photographs, featuring the inner workings of vibrantly colored flowers, were all taken on his cellphone and have the shimmering quality of watercolors. Winnie Au for The New York Times ""I would have been a watercolorist,"" Mr. Grey said, ""had I had the talent."" The walls of his West Village loft overlooking the Hudson River are filled with art he has made and collected -- including African sculptures that cover an entryway table; black-and-white photographs outside the open kitchen; Miro drawings in the guest bathroom. There is a rag by Richard Tuttle that he bought from the dealer Betty Parsons; a paper doughnut by Robert Rauschenberg; ladders by Bruce Robbins; and an abstract by Thomas Stokes. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Tell me about the Tuttle. I love it. One of his assistants sent me a note that said: ""The best way to carry the thing around is crumpled up in a paper bag like dirty laundry."" From left, on wall, the Tuttle; a Robert Rauschenberg paper sculpture from the series ""Pages & Fuses"" (1974); and ""From the Billboard Papers"" (2013), by Mr. Grey.

Robert Rauschenberg Foundation/Licensed by VAGA at Artists Rights Society (ARS), NY; Winnie Au for The New York Times Winnie Au for The New York Times This is a sand play piece by Grace Knowlton. You make art. It's actually a psychological therapy called sand play therapy. When did you become interested in art? I've always loved it. I was a very good finger painter. Did you grow up around art? When I was 7 or 8 I went to the Cleveland Museum of Art on school trips. I was hoping I could sneak behind the class and they'd forget about me and I could be there all day. Art meant a lot to me from the get-go, especially the Egyptian rooms. Why didn't you stay with visual art? I found I couldn't draw for one reason or another and that was the end of my art career. Before I knew it, I was onstage. Test prints for ""The Flower Whisperer"" and, lower right, a picture Mr. Grey took of the cast of the Yiddish production of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" he directed. Winnie Au for The New York Times It's sort of like the stage -- quick moments of a life that are gone the minute you take your eyes away and the curtain comes down. A passion for flowers has always been with me. I've loved all Mapplethorpe's work and O'Keeffe's. I started this flower project four years ago, and I threw out half of them; they weren't abstract or painterly enough. They were too literal. Are you drawn to any flowers in particular? I got very crazy with orchids. All of a sudden I started to say, 'What's inside?' I thought maybe the book would be called, ""Petals, Pistils, and Stamens, Oh My."" I go to 28th Street [a wholesale flower market] after the gym and they know me in a certain place where I go every week. I walk among them. Can you imagine making art your career? It's only pleasure. It's never been work. Do you feel like an artist? I'm still learning and I feel like a neophyte always. Winnie Au for The New York Times How do you know Ron Kitaj? We were classmates in Cleveland at Doan Elementary School. Ronnie and I have pictures of the two of us in short pants. I met Hockney through him and Jim. Duane Michals is also a close friend. He photographed me in ""Cabaret"" for Glamour. That's how long I've known him. Why are you drawn to artists as friends? Whatever it takes to make art, to imagine, to dream are similar to me. As a director, the dreams are everything. Do you go to museums and galleries? I go to the Met to wander and to be inspired all the time. I don't even know where I'm going to go, because it's endless. What do you think about what the art market has become? Nutty. I don't think about that. I think about what's fresh, beautiful, touching and surprising. That's what I like: surprise.","Photography, his personal passion, is ""quick moments of a life that are gone the minute you take your eyes away,"" he says.",13c70102-fae0-5632-8578-4bcbcee97e2f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/28/arts/28showwall-grey1/28showwall-grey1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=e6b3892a1a9b140d407ba9c6ee04329bfe0026a1013904e251b2253b4dc762b8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Joel Grey in his loft in front of a Richard Tuttle &ldquo;rag,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lake&rdquo; (1967).

* None 

Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, our TV critic Margaret Lyons offers hyper-specific viewing recommendations in our Watching newsletter. Read her latest picks below, and sign up for the Watching newsletter here. This weekend I have ... 20 minutes, and I like soft comedy  'The Dress Up Gang'

When to watch: Now, on the TBS website or app (cable login required). This dreamboat little comedy sat in TV purgatory for a while, but now its happy, offbeat 10 episodes are finally available. The show is about two roommates, their extended social circle and their unusual dynamics, and its through-the-looking-glass hyper-sincerety is both enchanting and warmly deranged. It uses a lot of sketch structures, but it isn't paced like a sketch show, nor is it like any of the indulgent stand-up auteur comedies. Instead, it feels like the modern version of the shows one discovered on obscure channels in the middle of the night in 1999. If you like ""At Home With Amy Sedaris"" and ""Joe Pera Talks With You,"" watch this. A moment from ""Mass,"" as seen on ""Great Performances: Leonard Bernstein Mass."" 'Great Performances: Leonard Bernstein Mass'

When to watch: Friday at 9 p.m., on PBS (check local listings). If you miss live performances and large outdoor gatherings, watch this broadcast of the 2019 production of ""Mass: A Theatre Piece for Singers, Players and Dancers"" at Ravinia, starring Paulo Szot and conducted by Marin Alsop. ""Mass,"" commissioned for the opening of the Kennedy Center in 1971, recreates aspects of a Catholic mass, and it's considered one of Bernstein's more divisive works. It's a lot on a lot on a lot, and occasionally involves literal preaching to the choir -- though of course, that's how you make 'em sing. Elle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult star as Catherine the Great and Peter III in this cheeky spin on period drama. Lush, elaborate, vulgar, cartoonish, grand -- moment to moment, ""The Great"" can have the pomp of ""The Crown"" and the devilishness of ""Drunk History"" or ""Miracle Workers."" Fanning is terrific, and she is often captured looking just offscreen, which adds to the sense of disorientation and imbalance that fuels the first arc of Catherine's story. There are 10 episodes, which is a few too many, but when it's firing, ""The Great"" is pretty darn good.","Catch an offbeat and newly available comedy, as well a lush and devilish new spin on period drama, starring Elle Fanning.",d883a2b1-4b6f-5ac1-99b1-0e87b14c0a5a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/14/arts/14Watching-Dress-Up/merlin_172489818_93805af7-f8b0-4dbd-8711-0a6dc4c819d5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=6a3a16ced2f0af1d701a32ae23a9876c964a88819075b273b607c1780698b419&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A scene from ""The Dress Up Gang.""

Health,"To Lower Costs, Trump to Force Hospitals to Reveal Price of Care",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/health/list-hospital-prices-trump.html,"The Trump administration on Friday announced it would begin forcing hospitals to publicly disclose the discounted prices they negotiate with insurance companies, a potentially bold move to help people shop for better deals on a range of medical services, from hip replacements to brain scans. ""For decades, hospitals, insurance companies, lobbyists and special interests have hidden prices from consumers, so they could drive up costs for you, and you had no idea what was happening,"" President Trump said Friday afternoon in the White House's Roosevelt Room. ""You'd get bills that were unbelievable and you'd have no idea why."" Patients, he said, have ""been ripped off for years."" The federal rule, which would not take effect until 2021, is part of a broader push by Trump officials to make health care markets more transparent to patients. The administration also unveiled a proposed rule to require insurers to allow patients to get advanced estimates of their out-of-pocket costs before they see a doctor or go to the hospital. Mr. Trump rolled out the initiative personally, providing some counterprogramming to the second day of impeachment hearings while showing his willingness to take on powerful interest groups like hospitals and insurers.

Mr. Trump was ""taking historic action to make health care prices transparent for consumers, yet the coverage on all the cables remains on the impeachment inquiry charade,"" his press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, tweeted. ""Dems should get back to work -- just like our"" president. The hospital industry, which has long kept its negotiations with insurers secret, said it would challenge the rule in federal court. ""This is a very radical proposal,"" said Tom Nickels, an executive vice president with the American Hospital Association, a trade group. Hospitals say the administration does not have the authority to compel them to disclose their private negotiations and compared the order to forcing private parties to reveal trade secrets. But if the rule survives, ""it's a game changer,"" said John Barkett, a former Obama administration official who is now a health policy expert at Willis Towers Watson. Knowing the price of a colonoscopy or knee surgery before it takes place ""would be hugely helpful,"" he said. The administration's decision to aggressively tackle the secrecy surrounding hospital prices came amid widespread concern about rising costs for medical care. Democrats have also been campaigning on soaring health care costs, and both parties fear entering the 2020 campaign season with unfulfilled promises to gain control of out-of-pocket health spending.

People ""are increasingly exposed to the crazy pricing of health care,"" said Chas Roades, one of the founders of Gist Healthcare, a consulting firm in Washington. ""We are overdue for a public airing of how all of this works."" While the hospitals' legal challenge may succeed, they are vulnerable to the increasing public outcry over high prices, Mr. Roades said. ""It's not a good look for the industry to push back on transparency on prices."" Mr. Trump seemed to relish taking on powerful interest groups. ""I don't know if the hospitals are going to like me too much anymore with this, but that's O.K., right?"" he asked. About health insurers, he quipped, ""they'll be thrilled."" The new rule requires hospitals to make a range of prices easily available, such as prices negotiated within an insurer's network, what hospitals are paid if their care is out of a patient's insurance network, and what the hospital would accept for the treatment if paid in cash. Administration officials, employers and others have criticized hospitals and insurers for keeping the deals they strike a secret, making it challenging for patients to seek less expensive care. They argue that by making it easier for people to find the actual prices that insurers pay -- and not just the standard list prices for various services, which the Trump administration started requiring hospitals to post earlier this year -- hospitals will be under more pressure to compete on prices. The rule has the potential to roil the health care industry, which critics argue use the secrecy of their negotiations to keep prices high. A recent study showed that private insurers pay some hospitals two to three times more than the federal Medicare program pays for the same care. Even employers say they have little visibility into the prices being paid by the insurers on behalf of their workers. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Proponents of the rule say it will create a working health care market in which hospitals compete on price and quality. People will be able to look for hospitals that give them the best value, said Cynthia Fisher, a health care entrepreneur and the founder of the group Patient Rights Advocate. ""It will be aggregated and assimilated in a way that people can have ready access to it,"" she said.

Both the hospitals and health insurers say they should not be required to make public what they consider proprietary information, and they are expected to mount legal challenges to any mandated disclosure. In Ohio, a state law requiring price transparency that was passed two years ago is still waylaid in the courts. Hospitals say that disclosing prices would lead to higher costs, not reduce them, because each institution would know the prices of its competitors and could be reluctant to settle for less. Health insurers, which have voiced similar concerns, said they were evaluating the rules. ""Transparency should be achieved in a way that encourages, not undermines, competitive negotiations to lower patients' and consumers' costs and premiums,"" said Matt Eyles, the chief executive of America's Health Insurance Plans, which represents insurers, in a statement. Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, called that "" a canard."" But the legal challenge ahead is real. When the Trump administration tried to require pharmaceutical companies to disclose the list price of their drugs in their television ads, the courts blocked the regulation. A federal judge ruled last summer that the Department of Health and Human Services exceeded its regulatory authority with the rule, which was seen as largely symbolic since list prices are not what patients typically pay. ""We may face litigation, and we feel we are on a very firm legal footing,"" said Mr. Azar, who emphasized the information is already being made public to patients on what is called an explanation of benefits form -- but after they go to the doctor or get a medical treatment. Mr. Nickels from the hospital association said information about all of a hospital's negotiated prices with individual insurers is not currently available. ""That isn't public information given to everyone, given to competitors,"" he said.","A proposed federal rule would make hospitals list the prices they negotiate with insurers, allowing consumers to seek better deals for care.",8af4596a-aa47-50d8-892f-1d056d643895,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/15/science/15HOSPITALS/15HOSPITALS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=60f498e9ea35c70026a1468d3c90c8a675b32f235a9de97df2b3405cbbec374b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Alex M.

Travel,My Berlin: Reckoning With the Past,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/travel/berlin-germany.html,"Last year, after nearly a decade of long sojourns in Berlin, I signed the lease on an apartment in a pre-World War I, or altbau, building on a tree-shaded block just off Guntzelstrasse, a quiet neighborhood southwest of the city center. Although I was vaguely aware that the city's Jewish community had once been centered here, I found it unsettling to discover that Nazi terror had unfolded just outside my front door. Beginning in 1942, the Gestapo arrested dozens of Jews on my street, Jenaer Strasse, and shipped them to Theresienstadt and Auschwitz, where almost all were killed. Today, whenever I'm back in town from my reporting around the world, I walk past a handsome apartment building just down the street from mine, where 23 Stolpersteine -- small brass memorial plaques embedded in the sidewalk -- lie in three neat rows, and try to imagine what had happened here: police wagons stopping in front, Hitler's uniformed enforcers marching up the stairs. In the 1910s and 1920s, about 20,000 Jews lived in this neighborhood, known as Wilmersdorf. By the time World War II ended, there were virtually no Jews left. Spending large amounts of time in Berlin requires a constant reckoning with the past. And yet the German capital, as I long ago discovered, doesn't allow you to linger too long over the dark side of its history. It is an astonishingly varied city, an urbanscape in a constant state of change, blending Kaiser-era glories, vestiges of Nazism, slapdash postwar architecture, multiple cultures and new creations -- bars, restaurants, museums and open public spaces that are continuously altering the face of the city. In recent months, the pace of change has accelerated, with the arrival in Germany of more than one million refugees from Afghanistan, Somalia, Eritrea, Iraq and, most of all, Syria, drawn here by Chancellor Angela Merkel's promise of sanctuary, a pledge that she has since drastically dialed back in the face of rising opposition from Germany's right wing.

Though unflinching about its past, Berlin is also looking toward the future. In just the past year, for instance, I've watched the neighborhood of sex shops and shoddy 1970s architecture around Zoo Station -- once the main train station of West Berlin -- undergo an ambitious redevelopment scheme. A new Waldorf Astoria, and the renovated Bikini-Haus complex, which includes the 25hours Hotel Bikini, the Israeli-owned rooftop Neni Restaurant, the Monkey Bar and the Gestalten Book Shop -- are transforming this once-dowdy corner of the west into an uncharacteristically trendy neighborhood. Berlin carries you along on a wave of reinvention and revival. I first arrived in Berlin in January 2000, to become Newsweek's Central European bureau chief. It was not a fortuitous beginning. The winter was snowy, gray and bitingly cold; the supermarkets were dismal; I didn't speak the language; the seam where the Berlin Wall once stood was still largely a landscape of rubble and vacant lots. But in the spring I met the former East Berliner who would become my wife, and I began to establish roots in the city. Then barely a year after getting there I was gone -- on my way to Jerusalem. Seven years later, after stints in the Middle East, at Harvard University and in South Africa, we returned, with two young sons in tow. I had left Newsweek and was trying to jump-start a new career as a freelance magazine and book writer, and Berlin -- cheap, child friendly and ideally situated in the heart of Europe -- seemed like a good place to spend a few years. Then the marriage broke up, I met another German woman, and in 2012 my third son was born. Without intending to, I had established a long-term connection to Berlin.

Moreover, just down the road lies Friedenau, a near-perfectly preserved island of Old World Berlin. A one-time settlement for convalescing veterans of the Franco-Prussian War, it developed over the next decades into a prosperous enclave of high-level civil servants, artists, writers and some Jewish families. I often cycle with my son to his preschool down Handjerystrasse, a long street of half-timbered mansions with rounded galleries and gabled red-tile roofs; palatial villas with marble lintels, gray-shingled cupolas and columned porticos; and English-style country manors marked by handsome brickwork and tidy front gardens. The place is rich in history, both tragic and inspirational: On Stubenrauchstrasse, the extension of Handjerystrasse, stands the home belonging to the founder of the Comedian Harmonists -- an all-male, mostly Jewish vocal group that achieved worldwide fame during the 1920s but fled Germany soon after the Nazis came to power. At Fregestrasse 76, unmarked by a plaque, is the house that belonged to Friedenau's most infamous resident, the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. Marlene Dietrich is buried in the neighborhood cemetery, and on Niedstrasse, just off Handjerystrasse, one of Germany's greatest novelists, Gunter Grass, lived for 30 years. The neighborhood's central location also makes it easy to reach the near-unbroken swath of lakes, forests and meadows that lie at the western edges of the city. On many Saturday mornings when I'm in town, we set out on bikes with our 4-year-old down the Sudwestkorso, a boulevard that cuts a diagonal swath through western Berlin. We often stop along the way at the BackerMann, one of Berlin's most popular bakeries, for zimtschnecken (cinnamon rolls) or my son's favorite, Ampelmannchen -- red and green cookies baked in the shape of the little figures that signal ""stop"" and ""go"" at Berlin traffic lights. The boulevard spills directly into the Domane Dahlem, a working organic farm in the rustic Dahlem neighborhood, built around a restored manor house originally constructed in 1560. A Saturday morning organic farmers' market selling cheeses, local honey and fresh produce draws hundreds to the farm's main courtyard; spinning, weaving and pottery demonstrations take place in the manor house during seasonal festivals. (Unlike in the Turkish markets to the east, the vendors here are almost exclusively ethnic Germans.)

Farther afield lie two of our other weekend getaway spots, Schlachtensee and Krumme Lanke, twin swimmable lakes inside the Grunewald, the wilderness on the outskirts of the capital that began as a private hunting ground of the Electors of Brandenburg in Prussia in the 16th century. Wildschwein still dwell deep in the forests, and I sometimes catch sight of these furtive, tusked and bristly beasts in the thick woods in the early morning. On fine weekends Fischerhutte, a pleasant biergarten and restaurant between the two lakes, is packed with affluent Berliners munching bratwurst and potato salad at picnic tables. Occasionally, I take a break from writing to ride my bike through the Grunewald, past the Jagdschloss Grunewald -- a hunting lodge built by the Prince-Elector Joachim II in 1542, and remodeled as a Baroque palace in the early 18th century. I head down a path through a forest to run or swim across the Schlachtensee, blissfully deserted during the workweek and best avoided on hot summer weekends. In the winter, we huddle under blankets at Fischerhutte and sip mulled wine and hot chocolate and, on the increasingly rare occasions when the lakes freeze over, haul our blades onto the ice for a day of skating. These forays into haut-bourgeois Berlin can obscure the darker side of the city, but this aspect is an inextricable part of Berlin's historical arc, and cannot be ignored. Any time I pass through the Grunewald S-Bahn station, in the leafy, placid Grunewald neighborhood, for example, I reflect upon the fact that this gloomy depot served as the major transit point for Jews from Berlin to the concentration camps. My usual bicycle route to Mitte, the city center, brings me past the Bendlerblock, the former Nazi defense headquarters beside the Tiergarten, where Claus Von Stauffenberg, the decorated Wehrmacht officer turned anti-Hitler conspirator, and his fellow officers involved in an assassination plot were executed in the courtyard in 1944. (Von Stauffenberg lived in an opulent house at Tristanstrasse 8, built at the turn of the 20th century, just a few steps down from my first Berlin home, in Nikolassee; Hollywood filmmakers closed off the street for a couple of days back in 2007 to film the Tom Cruise movie ""Valkyrie."") At Pfaueninsel, a one-time private island retreat for the Prussian King Frederick William II, paths meander through idyllic woodlands and meadows, frequented by peacocks and bordered on one end by a minicastle constructed by the monarch for his mistress. We've attended children's birthday parties here, thrown Frisbees and picnicked on the wide lawns. A couple of years ago I learned that the Nazi leadership, too, appreciated the island's pristine charms, and celebrated the closing of the 1936 Olympics by hosting a lavish ""Italian Night"" party here with 1,000 invited guests, including members of the SS. The experience for me has never been quite the same.

One of my favorite corners of this neighborhood is the broad green plaza at the end of Grimmstrasse, where the Admiralbrucke, or Admiral Bridge, crosses the Landwehr Canal. On one corner, Il Casolare, perhaps the best Neapolitan pizzeria in Berlin, draws hundreds of people on hot summer nights; the gelato shop across the road packs them in as well. The Planufer, a cobblestone street that follows the canal, winds past outdoor cafes and handsome prewar apartments before spilling into the Kottbusser Damm. Here Kreuzberg segues into Neukolln and the Planufer changes its name to the Maybacherufer, where, on Tuesdays and Fridays, one of the city's biggest Turkish markets transforms the area into a patch of Istanbul. In the dozens of crowded stalls that line both sides of the street, you can buy Turkish fabrics, glittery shoes, flatbreads, hummus, baba ghanouj, goat and sheep cheese and a bounty of produce ranging from fresh mint to pomegranates. It was on a wintry night in this neighborhood five years ago that I made a serendipitous discovery. Walking down Grimmstrasse, I noticed a light glowing from a basement, walked down four steps and stumbled into Fatima's Hand -- surely the hippest art gallery, coffee bar and coiffeur in Berlin. Presided over by an outgoing Turkish-German impresario-hair stylist named Fatime Kahveci, the place consisted of a cozy bar and salon decorated with Che Guevara posters and abstract art by local painters, and a back-room hair salon. Over the next five years I became a regular, honing my German over cappuccinos and hair cuts, attending art exhibitions and film screenings, and enjoying one of the neighborhood's most rollicking New Year's Eve parties. Sadly, escalating rents forced her to surrender her lease last summer, and she now cuts hair in her Kreuzberg apartment, a victim of creeping gentrification. After the 2008 closure of Tempelhof Airport -- constructed during the Weimar Republic, expanded by Nazi Germany and immortalized by the 1948-9 Berlin Airlift -- municipal leaders resisted pressure to sell the land to commercial real estate developers. Instead, to the approval of most Berliners, they turned it into a vast recreation ground, a semi-wilderness in the heart of the city. My two older sons and I like to show up here early on a Saturday morning. I park the car on Columbia Damm, adjacent to the park, and we maneuver on our in-line skates up the cracked, weedy asphalt paths leading to skater heaven: two mile-long adjacent runways that parallel the old main terminal building. There's a sense of skating through Berlin's history, with the terminal -- its imperial eagles still visible on its dun-colored facade -- looming in the background and an old United States Air Force plane, a remnant of the Luftbrucke, the airlift, parked before a gate. Our long, effortless sweeps along one runway often segue into a battle against gale-force headwinds on the way back, but there's ample opportunity to stop and catch our breath at the runway-side kiosks selling cappuccinos, hot chocolate and muffins.

Tempelhof has become a center of Berlin's life, its hangars and terminal hosting big functions such as the annual Press Ball, for the German and international media, its sprawling grounds the site of concerts and other cultural events. In early fall we cycled across Kreuzberg to attend the Drachenfest, or kite festival, which fills the skies over the airport with giant lobsters, stingrays, sharks and teddy bears. Tempelhof is now also in the throes of becoming Germany's largest refugee center: Hangars now provide shelter for 800 people; up to 7,000 will be housed there when work is completed. Half a mile south of Potsdamer Platz stands the Gleisdreieck Park, another experiment in urban redesign. From the end of World War II until 2011 this was one of Berlin's most blighted areas -- in the shadow of the Berlin Wall, sprawling beneath three sets of elevated tracks. The city redeveloped the eyesore into an oasis of play areas, lawns, running tracks, a halfpipe and even a dance floor, while incorporating vestiges of the old rail yards. We often take our son here with his scooter and watch him glide with delight across the park, still divided by a scruffy old railway line. Tempelhofer Park and the Park Am Gleisdreieck represent complementary approaches to urban renewal: the former preserving an abandoned space, the latter dramatically reinventing one. Shortly after I first moved to Berlin 15 years ago, I began making forays to the eastern half of the city. My wife-to-be lived in a walk-up apartment just off Danzigerstrasse in still gritty Prenzlauer Berg, and we spent much of our time in the cafes and restaurants of Kollwitzplatz, before an influx of young professionals turned the area around it into one of the highest-priced real-estate markets in the city. Fellow foreign correspondents were slowly shutting down their offices in the west and moving to the Pressehaus across the Spree from the Reichstag. There was a pioneering and raw quality to the place, a sense of flux and possibility. Today I still get to the east on a regular basis -- a healthy jolt out of my sedate Wilmersdorf existence -- though even once-frontier neighborhoods like Neukolln and Friederichshain have been tamed and gentrified during the past decade. But the vibrancy of the street life, the variety of the restaurants -- from the fashionista hangout on the roof of Soho House near Alexanderplatz in Mitte to the wildly popular Korean hole-in-the-wall Yam Yam on Alte Schonhauser Strasse, also in Mitte -- can't be matched by anything in the west. And a walk along the Spree on a darkening July evening -- the Reichstag's glass dome glowing pink in the setting sun, the lights of the postmodernist Federal Chancellery Building, the official residence of Angela Merkel, reflecting off the river -- captures for me the essence of a confident, fully realized city that has swept away both its east-west divisions and the horrors of World War II. It's the perfect counterpoint to the Stolpersteine and other vestiges of the darkest period of German history, another reason that I find the city such an optimistic and astonishingly varied place. IF YOU GO Fischerhutte am Schlachtensee (Fischerhuttenstrasse 136; fischerhuette-berlin.de), overlooking one of Berlin's most picturesque lakes, has an expansive biergarten serving such fare as roast chicken, bratwurst and potato salad; and a pricier indoor restaurant that specializes in seafood and Bavarian cuisine. A meal for two inside, with wine, starts at about 50 euros (about $57); lunch in the biergarten for two costs about half that much.","The German capital is an astonishingly varied city, an urbanscape in a constant state of change and in recent months, the pace of change has accelerated.",95598fdb-d7a5-59bc-a23c-4fc269abb1d9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/15/travel/15BERLIN4/15BERLIN4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=3a12282eb82880f8d12272de221175e98f802ad2bd317df745a2661136e0b9e5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Il Casolare, perhaps the best Neapolitan pizzeria in Berlin, in Kreuzberg.",95598fdb-d7a5-59bc-a23c-4fc269abb1d9,N24News/imgs/95598fdb-d7a5-59bc-a23c-4fc269abb1d9.jpg,4
Dance,The Joyce Theater Confronts Its Own Staleness,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/25/arts/dance/the-joyce-theater-confronts-its-own-staleness-ny-quadrille.html,"As you make your way through the cramped lobby into the theater of the Joyce, one of New York's venerable dance spaces, it's best not to look down. But there it is again -- that carpet, with its hotel-chain print of zigzags and intersecting stripes in shades of beige, maroon and pink. How does a space and what surrounds it, a crucial frame for choreography, affect a performance? Can a theater become something new, reclaiming its aesthetic territory, without hiring a demolition crew to knock it down and start over from scratch? With its fixed proscenium stage and outdated decor, the Joyce Theater is finally facing a demon head-on: its own staleness. The choreographer Lar Lubovitch has come up with a way to breathe new life into the space. Inspired by an 18th-century dance performed in a rectangular formation, he has conceived and organized the performance series ""NY Quadrille."" For the two-week series, the Joyce will temporarily transform its theater, adding a new stage -- a runway-like platform that will cover several rows of seating -- that allows for viewing on four sides, with risers on what is normally the stage.

""We are trying to construct a new experience at the Joyce,"" Mr. Lubovitch said. ""The theater looks a certain way, the curtain goes up on a company, and whatever happens on a stage can be vastly different from week to week. However, the experience itself of attending the Joyce has grown to be somewhat regular, and this is a way to challenge that."" Mr. Lubovitch originally came up with the idea to reconfigure the theater for one of his own works but decided to go in a different direction. An avid dancegoer, he also enjoys programming and is a founder and artistic director of the Chicago Dancing Festival. In ""Quadrille,"" which starts on Tuesday, Sept. 27, he has selected four choreographers, whom he described as ""very different and each in their own way quite iconoclastic,"" to present programs: Loni Landon, Tere O'Connor, RoseAnne Spradlin and Pam Tanowitz. All but Ms. Spradlin have previously shown their work at the Joyce. Ms. Landon, 33, who has attended performances at the Joyce since she was a child, said that, to her, the Joyce has the feeling of a retro '70s theater. (Before its conversion, it actually was the Elgin Theater, a movie house.) ""This is giving it a makeover,"" she said. ""It's a big risk for the Joyce, but I think it's an exciting risk. I think it's going to be so refreshing because everyone in the dance community has almost stopped going to the Joyce. To be honest, I don't go because I can't even afford to go."" Linda Shelton, the Joyce's executive director, said she wants to see how the new stage works before offering it to other companies that want an alternative to the proscenium. She added that the Joyce was also considering the possibility of a more permanent makeover that would involve rebuilding the space. ""We're just starting a study to look at what we can do,"" she said.

The Quadrille artists, each of whom received a $15,000 commission plus a performance fee, will present a mix of new and recent works. Ms. Tanowitz leads with ""Sequenzas,"" a premiere set to music by Luciano Berio -- his sequenzas for viola, trombone and harp -- and David Lang's ""Stuttered Chant."" She has some surprises in store regarding her costumes (remember the carpet?) and sets, for which she is collaborating with the artist Suzanne Bocanegra to create unconventional backdrops in tribute to the Joyce's willingness to open up its space. In keeping with the four-sided stage, Ms. Tanowitz has had to consider the challenging prospect of ""choreography in all directions,"" as she put it. ""Even though I don't use front in my proscenium, I can control where people are looking."" She added: ""A lot of times what I love is having something very detailed happening at the same time as a full-picture composition, so the viewer can choose to follow one dancer's track or to look at the whole picture. It's like a painting: You can look up close or get the full picture."" Mr. O'Connor will present two works, including his new ""Transcendental Daughter,"" a trio for Natalie Green, Eleanor Hullihan and Silas Riener. He said he had been thinking about ""the multidimensionality of the space, whether it's proscenium or not"" since his dance ""Rammed Earth"" in 2007. In that piece, first presented at the Chocolate Factory, audience members sat on folding chairs scattered across the stage. ""In all of my work, I look at it from many viewpoints,"" he added. ""I really want to enhance that in people's viewership.""

Part of that, he said, relates to how you can imagine the back of the dance even while watching the front. ""Because there are often multiple points of activity in my dances, one of them may be frontal and the other might be a secondary thought that isn't taking up that kind of attention,"" he said. ""The viewer becomes a director of the work in that instance."" For Ms. Spradlin, whose new trio, ""X,"" explores the idea of an abandoned space, working with a platform stage isn't an alien experience. She used one for ""beginning of something"" (2011), and is versed in how to make swift changes once in the performance setting. ""Even if it's the side that you've paid no attention to, there are interesting things to be seen,"" she said. ""They get revealed to you in a lucky way, and I'm hoping that will happen again."" Ms. Landon will show two works, ""Fast Love,"" a premiere featuring four electric guitarists that explores human connection in the modern age, and a reprise of ""Rebuilding Sandcastles,"" which she knows will look vastly different in the new setting. She welcomes the change. ""We're so conditioned to watch dance in a certain way,"" she said. ""I think this is going to spin the Joyce on its head.""","The two-week ""NY Quadrille"" program will add a runway-like platform to the theater's proscenium stage, enabling fresh views from four sides.",ad273da5-4c8a-58cb-b5f8-a69430f671be,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/25/arts/25QUADRILLE/25QUADRILLE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=86fdb8ffa1c0010f7b866fce6f9ca7d93eab3af5c3f8292d5ee5a8be17d96d7d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Lar Lubovitch, seated, with, from left, Loni Landon, Pam Tanowitz, RoseAnne Spradlin and Tere O'Connor, the choreographers of ""NY Quadrille,"" which will temporarily reconfigure the Joyce Theater.",ad273da5-4c8a-58cb-b5f8-a69430f671be,N24News/imgs/ad273da5-4c8a-58cb-b5f8-a69430f671be.jpg,6
Education,"Asbestos in a Crayon, Benzene in a Marker: A School Supply Study's Toxic Results",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/education/asbestos-crayons-school-supplies.html,"A public interest group said this week that it had found toxic substances in a number of school supplies, including asbestos in a Playskool crayon and another carcinogen, benzene, in a dry-erase marker. The findings were detailed in a report published Tuesday by the group, the United States Public Interest Research Group Education Fund, which had an independent laboratory test 27 back-to-school products. Four tested positive for dangerous chemicals. ""It's insane for us to be finding asbestos in kids' products, whether it's technically legal or not, and parents shouldn't have to worry about this in 2018,"" said Dev Gowda, an author of the report who also directs the group's campaign to persuade manufacturers to drop toxic substances from personal care products. ""We wish that we didn't have to do a study like this, but the reality is that corporations -- from manufacturers, distributors and retailers -- aren't doing this for us,"" he said.

The group tested crayons, markers, binders, water bottles, lunchboxes, notebooks, rulers and glue. The products were purchased nationwide at a variety of businesses, including box stores, dollar stores, pharmacies, arts and crafts stores, and online. The group, which has been surveying toys for more than three decades, recommended that the companies that make or offer the products stop selling them and start notifying consumers about the chemicals they appear to contain. It also called on policymakers to continue to support the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a federal agency, and urged the commission itself to test more school supplies for dangerous chemicals. Here's a look at what the public interest group found: Of the crayons tested, one, a green Playskool crayon, tested positive for trace amounts of tremolite, a form of asbestos. The crayon was part of a set of 36 manufactured by Leap Year Publishing and purchased at a Dollar Tree store. Julie Duffy, a spokeswoman for Hasbro, which owns the Playskool brand, said that ""product and children's safety are top priorities"" for the company.

""We are conducting a thorough investigation into these claims, including working with Leap Year, the licensee of the product,"" she said in a statement. In an email, John Sorenson, a spokesman for Leap Year Publishing, said that all of its products, including the green crayon mentioned in the report, ""are thoroughly tested by independent labs"" to meet or exceed federal standards. ""We are currently re-verifying that they are safe and free of any asbestos, as well as requesting a review of P.I.R.G.'s testing methods,"" he said. Tremolite is responsible for many cases of asbestos-related cancer and asbestos diseases, according to the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania. In a statement, Dollar Tree said it was aware of the report and had ""since reverified that each of the listed products successfully passed inspection and testing."" Crayons sold under five other brands -- Crayola, Up & Up, Cra-Z-Art, Disney Junior Mickey and the Roadster Racers, and RoseArt -- tested negative for asbestos. Four markers were sent to the laboratory, and two dry-erase ones tested positive for a group of compounds often found in petroleum products and known as B.T.E.X.: benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene.

One of those compounds, benzene, is a known carcinogen and was found in a package of six magnetic markers purchased on Amazon and produced by The Board Dudes, a brand owned by Mattel. In a statement, Mattel said it took such reports seriously, ""aggressively"" tests its products and was reviewing the claims. The markers, the statement added, ""contain substance levels that fall within the permissible limits."" Benzene disrupts the normal functioning of cells, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Long-term exposure can have harmful effects on bone marrow and lead to a decrease in red blood cells. An Expo dry-erase scented marker, also purchased on Amazon, tested positive for some of the B.T.E.X. compounds, though not benzene and none at levels considered worrying by toxicologists, according to the report. In a statement, Expo said that it was aware of the report and that its products ""meet all applicable regulatory and safety standards."" In another set of tests, the public interest organization examined three three-ring binders for phthalates, a group of chemicals added to plastics to make them flexible, some of which may affect human reproduction or development. Only one, a Jot-brand, 1-inch blue binder from Dollar Tree, tested positive. Binders sold under the Avery and Yoobi brands did not.",A public interest group tested 27 back-to-school products and found dangerous chemicals in four of them.,cddc9340-8c3f-5063-a126-09f998351838,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/09/business/09xp-toxins/09xp-toxins-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=7d381227d5e8b6cd0bc87de8cfc0ee509158052f1033a9de3258d87c5cccaeb7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Crayola crayons tested negative for dangerous chemicals in a study by a consumer group, the United States Public Interest Research Group Education Fund.

Technology,Daily Report: The Treasure Found in Email,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/12/technology/daily-report-the-treasure-found-in-email.html,"In his State of the Art column on Wednesday, Farhad Manjoo, the technology columnist for The New York Times, examines the controversy over Donald Trump Jr.'s email thread in which he was told that Russian government officials could provide dirt on Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The emails have raised questions about just how much Russia influenced November's election.

The flap is also a reminder of the perils of email, and how messages can come back to bite you. Anything recorded is hard to eliminate -- the messages can be forwarded or saved, and they are never truly deleted. So if you have something sensitive to discuss, an old-fashioned phone call or an in-person meeting might be the better way to go.

It's a rough time. But, though some days I want very simple food, I'm not tired of cooking.

I'm also not tired of going to the farmers' market, or of spending time in kitchen. I don't tire of cooking pasta, warming garlic in olive oil or making toast. I still get excited when a bite of food tastes inordinately good. I still want to make a salad and put on a pot of beans. And there's still comfort in watching the seasons change.

I do understand the concept of kitchen burnout, more so with the doubled-up stress of the pandemic and the holidays, but the act of cooking and the ritual of sharing food can be relaxing, grounding and positive.

Think of this menu as a fun one to cook, maybe in a week or so.

Glenda Jackson will return to Broadway in ""King Lear,"" while Adam Driver takes on his first starring role there in ""Burn This.""

Expect the canyons of Broadway to echo with shouts and screams this spring -- and moaning and groaning and lamentation of an exceptional amplitude and ferocity. And I'm not referring to ticket buyers who have just registered what an orchestra seat will set them back, or not only that. Rather, I'm referring to two stars, much celebrated for their combustible presences on stage and screen, who will be taking on parts in which being able to generate high dudgeon at high volume is a primary job requirement. That would be the British actress Glenda Jackson, in the rage-filled title role of Shakespeare's ""King Lear,"" and the unlikely American heartthrob Adam Driver, who is portraying what might be described as an emotional arsonist in the first Broadway revival of Lanford Wilson's 1987 drama ""Burn This."" As is the case with many of this season's main-stem offerings, the road to New York for this ""King Lear"" and ""Burn This"" has hardly been a straight line. They're each arriving later than was originally anticipated -- and in somewhat altered form.

Lear is the part in which the then 80-year-old Ms. Jackson, a two-time Oscar winner who had left acting to become a member of Parliament, returned to the London stage after an absence of more than two decades. That production, directed by Deborah Warner at the Old Vic in 2016, reaped such ecstatic notices for its star that it was widely assumed it would be crossing the Atlantic posthaste.

Ms. Jackson did indeed show up on Broadway a little more than a year later. But it was not as Shakespeare's ultimate angry old man but as the angry old woman of Edward Albee's ""Three Tall Women,"" for which Ms. Jackson won a Tony for Best Actress in a Play. Now, a mere (and one hopes, for her, very restful) year later, Ms. Jackson will be reincarnating the most challenging role in the Shakespeare canon, but with a different director and supporting cast. The ""King Lear"" opening in April at the Cort Theater will be staged by Sam Gold, who showed an original and subversive hand for Shakespeare in starry productions of ""Othello,"" with Daniel Craig and David Oyelowo, and ""Hamlet,"" in which Oscar Isaac was the Prince of Denmark. (His ""Lear"" casts Ruth Wilson as both the King's Fool and one of his daughters.) ""Burn This,"" an intense, four-character study of love and grief in a New York loft, had been expected to come to the Hudson Theater in early 2017. That production was to be headlined by Jake Gyllenhaal -- in the role of a foul-mouthed, cocaine-hoovering restaurateur named Pale -- and directed by Michael Mayer. It was subsequently announced that because of ""scheduling conflicts with the show's star,"" the opening of ""Burn This"" would probably be ""during the 2017-2018 season."" The version of ""Burn This"" finally scheduled to open on April 16 will, as promised, be staged by Mr. Mayer at the Hudson. But its Pale is now Mr. Driver, playing opposite Keri Russell as a dancer in mourning (for her recently deceased roommate, Pale's brother).

Though Mr. Driver has appeared on New York stages before -- notably in revivals of ""Look Back in Anger"" (directed by Mr. Gold in 2012) and Terence Rattigan's ""Man and Boy"" (2011) -- it was in supporting roles of relative calm, meant to ballast the showier, fierier leading parts played by Matthew Rhys (in ""Anger"") and Frank Langella (in ""Man""). But anyone doubting Mr. Driver's ability to do bad, mad and dangerous need only take a look at his subsequent screen work, including his turn as the arch-villain Kylo Ren in the recent ""Star Wars"" films. Or check out his set-incinerating fight with Jemima Kirke in the Season 5 finale of HBO's ""Girls."" Theatergoers attending ""Burn This"" might do well to wear asbestos. As for Ms. Jackson, no one has doubted her capacity for delivering annihilating rage since she destroyed the hulking Oliver Reed in Ken Russell's 1969 film of ""Women in Love."" Nor should anyone question this octogenarian's capacity to ""howl, howl, howl"" nightly against the bleak and cruel universe of ""Lear."" Speaking last year of her performance as Lear in London, Ms. Jackson said matter-of-factly, ""I expected to do it eight times a week, because that's the way I've been raised. When the first additional matinee went in, the whole cast was asking me how I was, they were afraid I was going to die in the middle of it. ""The only time I ever felt tired was on Sundays when we didn't have to do it. Because there's so much energy in the play,"" she said. Cosmic rage, it would appear, is a great rejuvenator.","In ""King Lear"" and ""Burn This,"" the stars have volcanic roles in productions that required patience to come together.",3d9917ec-6da8-58af-bbda-0804e43619ad,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/24/arts/24BRANTLEY1/24BRANTLEY1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=5492fc3abf0f4d14675fdf8e7ef3ac3b899badb22c9f09f9df810b411ca83ff9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Glenda Jackson will return to Broadway in &ldquo;King Lear,&rdquo; while Adam Driver takes on his first starring role there in &ldquo;Burn This.&rdquo;",3d9917ec-6da8-58af-bbda-0804e43619ad,N24News/imgs/3d9917ec-6da8-58af-bbda-0804e43619ad.jpg,10
Music,An All-but-Extinct Piano Plays Once More,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/arts/music/tangent-piano-alexei-lubimov-ecm.html,"When a recording of forgotten music on a forgotten instrument appears on the prestigious ECM label, chances are good that something ear-opening has been exhumed from the graveyard of history. On his latest release for ECM's New Series, the Russian pianist Alexei Lubimov performs music of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach (1714-88) on the all-but-extinct Tangentenflugel (tangent piano), offering the listener a double oddity: a rarely heard composer interpreted on a rarely heard instrument.

The tangent piano represents a broken branch in the genealogy of the piano. It was produced in the second half of the 18th century alongside the fortepiano, the immediate ancestor of today's pianoforte. As early as 1751, Franz Jacob Spath, a builder of clavichords, fortepianos and organs, was producing tangent pianos in Regensburg, Germany, assisted later by his son-in-law and partner, Christoph Friedrich Schmahl. Fewer than 20 examples, fragile and temperamental, survive.

Sight unseen, the tangent piano sounds like the Middle Eastern santur, the Eastern European cimbalom or the hammered dulcimer. Visually, it could be confused with a harpsichord or Viennese fortepiano. Tonally, however, the plucking action of the harpsichord produces a ""plick,"" and the light-hammered fortepiano a ""pahng,"" but the tangent piano a ""pingk."" Of course, unlike those other two early keyboard instruments, the tangent piano is as endangered as the black rhinoceros. The instrument has two knee-activated levers under the keyboard, the equivalent of the foot-operated damper and ""una corda"" pedals on pianos today. Raising the dampers allows the strings to resonate, while the ""una corda"" lever physically shifts the keyboard so that, of the double strings provided for each note, only single strings are struck.

On the album, Mr. Lubimov uses a 2006 instrument from the Belgian workshop of Chris Maene, modeled on a 1791 original by Spath and Schmahl that's now in the collection of the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague, Netherlands. (Given the fragility of the originals, it was prudent of Mr. Lubimov to work on a newly made ""antique."") I have examined a similar instrument, built around 1784, at the National Music Museum in Vermillion, S.D., to familiarize myself with this keyboard curiosity. Mr. Lubimov revels in the instrument's sonic inventions. A champion of contemporary music who also has considerable experience interpreting older works on historical instruments, he has chosen, as a perfect pairing to this instrument, the music of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach. Never fully embraced by modern pianists -- unlike his father, Johann Sebastian Bach -- C.P.E. Bach prospers brilliantly through this combination of performer and instrument.

Rather than the elemental abstraction of his father's work, Carl Philipp Emanuel demands distinct colors and a headfirst, visceral engagement between performer and instrument. In Mr. Lubimov's interpretation, strong attacks bloom with bursts of fragrance. Soft attacks, depending on the mechanism used, ring from a distant horizon or whisper through a veil. This music -- at least the large-scale sonatas and fantasias that begin and end the recording -- demand attentive listening. In a positive way, you can never get in a groove: There's no predictable next note, rhythm, chord or key. Does that unexpected silence at one point mean my headphones cut out? No, this composer wants the listener's ears to remain queued up for the next surprise. And these effects are not the performer's whim: They are exhaustively described in C.P.E. Bach's own tutorial, ""Essay on the True Art of Playing Keyboard Instruments."" Most revealing throughout this recording is what a liability for this music is the colossal resonance of the modern piano, when even a clipped staccato note can't fully decay before the next one sounds.

Sports,"As N.F.L. Fights Racism and Sexism, Team Owners Undercut the Message",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/25/sports/football/woody-johnson-trump-jets.html,"The N.F.L. has taken strides to repair its image as being insensitive to issues facing women and people of color. But the league continues to be confronted by an uncomfortable reality: Its efforts can be undercut by reports of toxic behavior at the tops of its franchises. Woody Johnson, the owner of the Jets and the United States's ambassador to Britain, was accused of making comments to embassy colleagues that they found racist or sexist, complaints that State Department investigators included in a report filed in February. The report has not been released publicly, but according to interviews with half a dozen current and former embassy employees, Johnson regularly made his female and Black staff members uncomfortable, or worse, with comments about their appearance or race. One Black female diplomat, for example, told colleagues that Johnson disparaged her efforts to schedule events for Black History Month, accusations that were first reported by CNN. The diplomat said Johnson once asked if he had to speak to an audience that ""was just a bunch of Black people,"" and told her she was ""marginalizing"" herself.

The accusations against Johnson have surfaced as the N.F.L. grapples with two other crises of racism and sexism that reached recent turning points. Its team in the Washington, D.C., area has abandoned its longtime name and logo, which many consider a racist slur against Native Americans, after team owner Daniel Snyder resisted any change for decades. Last week, the Washington Football Team, as it is now known, also hired lawyers to investigate charges in the team's front office of widespread harassment of women, who said male executives repeatedly commented on their looks, sent inappropriate text messages and pursued unwanted relationships. The re-emergence of issues of discrimination involving two of the league's most prominent team owners comes as the nation confronts systemic racism in many of its institutions, including sports teams and leagues. Johnson has been the primary owner of the Jets since 2000, but he ceded daily control of the team to his brother, Christopher, when he was appointed ambassador in 2017 by President Trump. Johnson's arms-length distance from the team makes this different from other cases the N.F.L. has faced. Still, the new allegations of racism and sexism threaten to undercut the league's efforts to promote itself as having learned from past failings. The N.F.L.'s personal conduct policy says that ""everyone"" who is part of the league must refrain from ""conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in"" the N.F.L. The word ""everyone"" is emphasized with a bold font.

Yet the league has policed its owners inconsistently, in part because the circumstances around allegations that have surfaced have widely varied. The episodes surrounding Johnson and others raise fresh questions about how much the N.F.L. can change its culture without scrutinizing those with the most power in its franchises.

* Week 11 Predictions: Here are our picks against the spread.
* N.F.L. Tightens Covid Protocols: As cases rise and Thanksgiving approaches, the league is requiring masks inside team facilities and increasing testing.
* The Packers' Defense Is Their M.V.P.: Green Bay's oft-overlooked defense has kept the team from falling out of the Super Bowl chase.
* The Long Path to the Super Bowl: With 18 weeks in the regular season and fewer teams earning byes in the playoffs, the Super Bowl is still a long way off.
* Playoff Simulator: Explore every team's path to the postseason, updated live. ""They have the same story and it keeps repeating itself,"" said Upton Bell, a longtime football executive and the son of Bert Bell, a former commissioner and onetime owner of the Philadelphia Eagles. ""It isn't possible for the N.F.L. to be progressive."" Johnson denied the allegations on the ambassador's official Twitter account. ""I have followed the ethical rules and requirements of my office at all times,"" he wrote. ""These false claims of insensitive remarks about race and gender are totally inconsistent with my longstanding record and values."" In a statement, the N.F.L. said it was aware of accusations of problematic comments made by Johnson, but referred questions to the State Department. The league did not specify what action, if any, it is taking. The Jets said in a statement that since the Johnson family bought the team 20 years ago, the team has supported ""many different social justice, diversity, women's, and inclusion initiatives."" At least one Jets player, safety Jamal Adams, called out Johnson. ""Right is right. Wrong is wrong!"" Adams wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. ""If u don't think this is wrong you're part of the problem not the solution."" Adams, for months, has had a contentious relationship with the Jets, and on Saturday the team traded him and a 2022 fourth-round draft pick to the Seattle Seahawks for a 2021 first-rounder, a 2022 first-rounder, a 2021 third-rounder and safety Bradley McDougald.

The N.F.L. has wrestled with the issues of race and sexism more prominently than most North American sports leagues. About three-quarters of its players are Black and roughly half of its fans are women, but most majority owners are white men and the league has struggled to hire nonwhite head coaches and general managers. Individual franchises have in recent years faced scandals involving allegations of sexist behavior. In 2018, Jerry Richardson, the owner of the Carolina Panthers, sold the team and was fined by the N.F.L. after an investigation confirmed accusations, detailed in a Sports Illustrated report, that Richardson settled complaints of sexist and racist comments to employees with big payouts that came with nondisclosure agreements. The league fine was $2.75 million, while Richardson's proceeds from the sale were at least $2.2 billion. Last year, New England Patriots owner Robert K. Kraft was charged in Jupiter, Fla., with two misdemeanor counts of solicitation of prostitution. Kraft pleaded not guilty and a Palm Beach County judge threw out video evidence gathered in the day spa where Kraft twice went for massages. A three-judge appeals court panel last month heard arguments in the case, which is still pending. That legal outcome could prompt penalties from the league under its personal conduct policy. The N.F.L. has tried to address sexism among players and staff by requiring teams to interview women for executive positions; instituting anti-harassment training at the league office and clubs; and requiring teams to submit plans for unconscious bias training and anti-racism training. Even so, some inclusion and diversity consultants for the league have expressed frustration at the slow pace of change. The league had also struggled to respond to protests against racial injustice led by the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and other players who knelt during the playing of the national anthem beginning in 2016.

After the N.F.L. neither defended nor stopped the protests immediately, Trump turned the league into a political punching bag, calling on owners, some of whom heavily supported him politically, to fire players who demonstrated during the playing of the national anthem in 2017. Trump reiterated his stance that players should stand during ""The Star Spangled Banner"" last month, giving new fuel to a divisive debate that has pitted fans against players -- and players against team owners. Kaepernick last played in the 2016 season, and when he went unsigned in 2017, he accused the owners of colluding to keep him out of the league because of his political beliefs. After numerous entertainers said they would not perform at N.F.L. events in solidarity with Kaepernick, the league paid the quarterback and his former teammate, Eric Reid, several millions of dollars to settle their case. Before the 2018 season, team owners also threatened to discipline players for demonstrating during the anthem, but the plan was quickly scuttled after the players' union objected. Renewed protests that grew after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in police custody in May led the league's commissioner, Roger Goodell, to side more firmly with players who wanted to speak out about systemic racism. After a number of star players released a video in June that called for the commissioner to explicitly say ""Black Lives Matter,"" Goodell apologized for not having listened to the concerns of African-American players earlier. It was a hard pivot for the league's top executive, who works at the behest of the team owners who form what is effectively a trade association. But the statement also did not acknowledge the status of Kaepernick, who has still not received an offer from an N.F.L. team. Goodell's efforts on racism have mostly centered on trainings for players and football staff, hiring practices, and on supporting community groups. The league pledged tens of millions of dollars in 2017 to organizations fighting social injustice. Last August, he hired Roc Nation, the company owned by music impresario Jay-Z to help the league with a social justice initiative. The N.F.L. also pledged support to the Players Coalition, a player-led group that focuses on legislative measures and other steps to fight systemic racism, and planned other cosmetic changes during games.

But the public initiatives and performances do not focus on the owners, who have wide latitude to run their teams and immense sway over many issues governing the league. Team owners are seldom investigated or punished by the league for their own conduct, especially if complaints have little direct relation to the game of football. Still, some see the conflict between the actions of the N.F.L. and its owners as a sign of change. As the league office pushes ahead with initiatives like boosting the number of female executives, some individual teams lag. Ashland Johnson, the founder of Inclusion Playbook, a company that advises sports leagues on social responsibility, likened this dynamic to an N.F.L. receiver who catches a touchdown pass. The player might make the play look easy, but it is because of years spent practicing and preparing. Similarly, recognizing that a team name is racist or letting players speak out against social injustice happens after a lot of debate sways minds, she said. Even calling out an owner for his behavior is a sign of progress. ""It's kind of a tug of war,"" Ashland Johnson said. ""When you move the ball forward, sometimes you go backward. Some of these things take decades."" Mark Landler in London, and Lara Jakes and Maggie Haberman in Washington contributed reporting.","The league has often focused its progressive efforts at employees, players and public displays.

Fuel injection is a given, antilock brakes are appearing on more bikes each year and drive-by-wire throttles are rapidly gaining ground.

The oneupsmanship is most intense among the racetrack-focused sportbikes, where the benefits of traction control and on-the-fly adjustments of the engine management system can be best appreciated.

Music,Anything Goes in Berlin's Clubs. But Are Bouncers Killing the Vibe?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/arts/music/berlin-club-bouncers.html,"Anything Goes in Berlin's Clubs. But Are Bouncers Killing the Vibe? 
* None   Gordon Welters for The New York Times

BERLIN -- Every weekend (and many weeknights), Berlin's clubs open up as spaces where anything goes. Fetish wear, nudity and sex? No big deal. Closing times, sometimes days after the party started, are determined by how many records the D.J. has in their bag. Many of the biggest and best-known clubs have no-photo policies, and some even place stickers over cellphone cameras on the way in. The idea: Partygoers unrecorded by social media can feel liberated of society's expectations. It's a surprising starting point for a photo exhibition, yet ""No Photos on the Dance Floor!"" at the C/O Berlin photography museum through Nov. 30, aims to tap into some of this utopian dance floor mythology. Spanning the storied years of night life in the German capital, from the early 1990s, with the rise of techno monoliths like Tresor and E-Werk, right up to the present, the show pays homage to a vibrant and permissive culture. ""Loveparade Ku'damm"" (1992) by Ben de Bie, on show in ""No Photos on the Dancefloor!"" at the C/O Berlin photography museum. Like many Berlin exhibitions, the show was accompanied by several events, including film screenings, talks, and of course a party series. And that was where the trouble started. In September, the Berlin police were called to one of the parties at the museum to deal with a violent incident between security staff and guests, and the event was closed early. Video footage, which circulated on Facebook and Instagram, showed a partygoer, Shaun Bass, being dragged along the floor and out of the venue by two security staff, and kicked by another female bouncer. In an exchange of Facebook messages with The New York Times, Bass said he was sober at the time and had not been aggressive. ""To be treated in this way is insane,"" he said. Another guest, Simon Kaiser, a Berlin club promoter, said the same female staff member hit him in the head and threatened him. The incident revealed an ugly mismatch between the relaxed and tolerant atmosphere portrayed in the exhibition, and the heavy-handed security around it. Berlin's clubs thrive on a permissive, D.I.Y. vibe that lets guests feel safe -- but some partygoers and activists say overzealous security staff are ruining the tolerant vibe. C/O Berlin and the party producer DISK Agency, which chose and briefed the security company, both made public apologies to everyone at the party. A spokesman for KV Security , the agency that employed the bouncers, declined to comment for this article. ""The security people are supposed to protect us,"" said Nico Limo, who says they were slapped and racially abused by a bouncer at the night club Berghain. ""But these things keep happening."" Gordon Welters for The New York Times One of Berlin's best known clubs, Berghain, recently fired a member of its security staff after a partygoer made a formal complaint. Nico Limo, who identifies as nonbinary and uses gender-neutral pronouns , said a bouncer slapped them and made racist remarks after a dispute at the club's coat check. ""The security people are supposed to protect us,"" Limo said in a phone interview. ""But these things keep happening."" A spokesman for Berghain declined to discuss the incident, citing the club's longstanding policy of not commenting to the news media. In 2016, Berghain was officially designated a ""cultural institution"" by a regional court, meaning it pays a reduced tax rate, like the Berlin Philharmonic or the Schaubuhne theater. The ruling highlighted the significance night life plays in the city, where the sector generates nearly 1.5 billion euros (about $1.65 billion dollars) a year, according to a 2019 study from the Club Commission, an association of Berlin's night club owners. No Shade, the collective of female, trans and nonbinary D.J.s that organized the event at C/O Berlin, said in a statement that abuses of power by club security staff were common in the city. ""The creation of these spaces for marginalized communities is the foundation of global club culture,"" the statement on Facebook said, adding that it was disturbing that ""such traumatic incidents could take place at an exhibition intended to not only recognize, but celebrate these roots."" This legacy was ""what Berlin prides itself on,"" Kaiser said in an interview in Berlin, in October. He is taking legal action against the security staff, and is working with the Club Commission on a training program for bouncers to reduce aggressive incidents. ""Outside Snax Club"" (2001) by Wolfgang Tillmans, from the C/O exhibition Lutz Leichsenring, a spokesman for the Club Commission, said most altercations arose at the door, because of ""selection."" Part of many bouncers' jobs, this murky science entails deciding whether someone has the right look and general demeanor to come in. However, there are many who feel that bouncers use racist criteria and exclude people from ethnic minorities from joining the party. A spokesman from the Antidiscrimination Agency in Berlin said that it had provided legal advice on more than 500 cases of discrimination at club doors since 2006. Kaiser said he thought that violent incidents like the one he was involved in were rare, but added that when they did happen, it was important to hold security staff to account. He said he had received many messages of support from other people who had witnessed or been victims of assault by bouncers. But, since many partygoers who live in or visit Berlin don't speak German, many were put off from going to the police or taking legal action, for fear of not being taken seriously by the authorities, he said. People who work in club security had also got in touch, Kaiser said, to say they wanted to contribute to a safer environment. ""I don't want to demonize anyone, but I think something has to be said,"" he added. ""If no one says anything, they're going to keep doing it.""",Some partygoers say heavy-handed security staff and racist door policies are ruining the tolerant atmosphere of the city's club scene.,45017c88-4432-588f-ab4c-2d4b77bf548f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/14/arts/14bouncers1/14bouncers1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=366840c9fe78e3760fba4db1f6cbab1859f4d77f7468c1ea3c0b10c8528b809c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Simon Kaiser is taking legal action against security staff at a party in Berlin, who he says hit and threatened him.",45017c88-4432-588f-ab4c-2d4b77bf548f,N24News/imgs/45017c88-4432-588f-ab4c-2d4b77bf548f.jpg,12
Health,Forget Spas and Bars. Hotels Tout Housekeeping to Lure Back Travelers.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/health/coronavirus-hotels-infect.html,"When Beau Phillips checked into a hotel near Toledo recently, a table in front of the counter barricaded him from getting too close to the clerk, who wore a mask and stood behind a plastic window. ""The key is gently tossed at you from three feet away,"" said Mr. Phillips, a public affairs executive who was staying at a Radisson Country Inn & Suites while visiting family. The hotel's breakfast buffet was gone, the fitness center closed, elevators limited to two riders. And to reduce the risk of an in-person visit, after Mr. Phillips left his room each day, no housekeeper came in to make the bed. The pandemic has plunged the hotel industry into a historic downturn. Average hotel occupancy dipped as low as 22 percent in late March, and had risen to a still miserable 48.1 percent the week ending July 25, according to STR, a market research firm. So hotels nationwide have embarked on a transformation of the most basic ways they run their business, aimed at showing would-be travelers they understand where they're at: terrified.

Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, in its new ""Count on Us"" pandemic marketing campaign, heralds the use of ""hospital grade"" cleaning products. It is putting on overt shows of sanitation: Housekeepers now linger and clean around the lobby, conspicuously wiping down public areas, luggage carts, door knobs, and the counter. ""In the past, we may have cleaned hotels in the overnight because you didn't necessarily want to see people cleaning,"" said Lisa Checchio, the chief marketing officer of Wyndham, the franchise parent of Wyndham, Days Inn, Super 8, La Quinta and more than a dozen other major brands among its 6,000 domestic hotels. Hilton new program (marketing name: ""CleanStay"") includes a partnership to use Lysol cleaning products that requires individual hotels to use the company's products and display the Lysol logo ""prominently."" Room cleanings include extra time spent on ""high-touch areas"" that included light and climate control switches, handles and knobs, telephones and clocks. And, or course, the remote control ""which has one of the highest ick factors or perceived ick factors,"" said Phil Cordell, Hilton's global head of new brand development.

He recalled that one guest had wrapped the plastic lining from the ice bucket around the remote control before using it. ""People are understandably freaked out or hyper aware,"" Mr. Cordell said. The new research looked at the virus residue left by two ""pre-symptomatic"" patients there who were quarantined in China in March -- students who had returned from overseas and were placed in hotels during a mandatory waiting period. Their rooms were swabbed for evidence that the virus lingered after the students had been there 24 hours, but before the rooms were cleaned. The researchers said the study shows that hotel rooms must be rigorously cleaned between guest stays and done so with an eye to how the virus spreads. ""To minimize the possibility of dispersing virus through the air, we recommend that used linens not be shaken upon removal,"" the study said, ""and that laundered items be thoroughly cleaned and dried to prevent additional spread.

To show they are, indeed, rigorous in their cleaning, several chains are heralding the consulting they are getting from big-name medical institutions. Four Seasons said it signed a consulting agreement with Johns Hopkins Medical International as part of an effort ""to inform health and safety decisions based on the latest scientific knowledge,"" while Hilton retained counsel from the Mayo Clinic to develop ""enhanced cleaning standards."" All the attention to sanitation has created other issues. Since the masks employees are required to wear shroud smiles, Hilton, which has hotels throughout the world, has been experimenting with hand gestures to express warmth and welcome. ""One is a very simple wave. In some cultures, it could be a bow,"" Mr. Cordell said. ""It could be hats off but with no hat -- but that could look kind of weird -- or a hand over heart.""

Given the industry's dire economic crisis, some of the changes it's adopting cost little, or even save money, said Bjorn Hanson, former dean of hospitality at New York University who has also spent years working inside the industry. For instance, he said, hotels can save money on housekeeping by not cleaning rooms every night, or by promising not to put guests in adjoining rooms, as some hotels have done (in reality, there's not enough occupancy to have high density anyway). ""Safety doesn't necessarily cost money,"" he said. ""It could be an excuse for saving money,"" Some would-be travelers say they're just not ready to return, no matter the assurances. ""I've stayed at nice hotels in the past and found something sticky. If I found something sticky and smudgy now, it would send me to the moon,"" said Kevin Mercuri, chief executive of a New York public relations firm. He and colleagues recently decided against visiting a client in Georgia partly to avoid hotels. His concern about hotels, in a nutshell: ""Fear of infection."" The C.D.C. has recommended that people who stay at hotels check in online, choose properties where staff wear masks and that regularly clean or remove shared-touch items, like pens or phones, and disinfect doorknobs, ice and vending machines, among other things. Charles Gerba, a professor at the University of Arizona who studies hotel cleanliness, said hotels do not pose significant risk of transmission of Covid-19 so long as they clean with products known to kill the virus.

""If a product is EPA approved and you're not using it right, it isn't doing me any good,"" he said, meaning that cleaning must be thorough and not taken lightly. He said he'd feel comfortable staying at a hotel, but would decline daily maid service, and bring his own hand sanitizer and wipes. Other public health researchers said that the risk of a hotel stay depended heavily on an the customer's own commitment to wearing a mask or remaining socially distant. ""You need to an make informed decision to maintain your space,"" said Eyal Oren, an associate professor in the Division of Epidemiology and Bioinformatics at the San Diego State University School of Public Health. He said hotels do offer the prospect of such distancing, ""which I'd distinguish from an airplane."" For people who choose to travel, one perk comes at the expense of the hotels: the price. STR, the market research firm, projects the average cost of a nightly stay in 2020 will wind up at $103, down from $131 a year ago. (In July, the average rate was $97). There are other savings too. Mr. Phillips always leaves a tip for the cleaning crew and did so again during his recent stay at the Country Inn & Suites outside of Toledo.","Hilton has partnered with Lysol, Four Seasons with Johns Hopkins Medicine.

Style,We Work. We Live. We Work Out. Eventually We Die.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/style/wework-fitness-gyms.html,"We Work. We Live. We Work Out. Eventually We Die.

First, WeWork did offices. Then came a co-living offshoot, WeLive, in which people rent furnished apartments for months at a time. Now ... WeSweat? In a dimly lit studio in the bowels of 85 Broad Street, Goldman Sachs's former headquarters in the financial district of New York, Jooin Im sat on a mat before a small class of yogis. Referring to a story she had heard on a ""This American Life"" podcast, Ms. Im talked about a truck driver who got tired of the grind: the same route, the same street signs, the same paycheck. So he drives off into the sunset (as it were), taking his bus from New York all the way to a moonlit Florida beach. ""'What happens when you take a leap?'"" Ms. Im asked, quoting from the podcast.

Rise is the newest venture from the WeWork company, which has brought foosball-infused bro-deco co-working spaces to 56 cities in 16 countries. The company says it has sold 150,000 memberships that entitle users to work out of the various locations. The goal of ""We,"" as executives refer to the company, is to overtake any conceivable venue for entrepreneurial-minded up-and-comers who are drawn to a clubby sense of community and the turnkey ease (if impersonal feel) of communal spaces.

""We"" wants to go from owning the place its members go to work to dictating ""ultimately where to live, ultimately where to work out, ultimately where to meet their friends for a drink after work,"" said Michael Gross, the company's vice chairman. (Clearly, next will come WeGotDrunk.)

But back to Rise, which the executive team also considered calling WeRun or WeWorkOut. After yoga, WeTook (well?) a tour of the facility, led by Avi Yehiel, WeWork's head of wellness. He was a professional soccer player in Israel and is married to the sister of Adam Neumann, one of WeWork's founders. Mr. Yehiel, in addition to at least a couple of WeWork publicists, helped fill the yoga class, although his real love is Pilates. The lobby is chock-full of drinks, snacks and beauty products, many of which are being made or marketed by companies run out of WeWork offices. There is This Granola Is Nuts. Here are Supergoop skin products. ""We are always looking for ways to help our members,"" Mr. Yehiel said. To that end, Rise, many floors beneath 85 Broad's WeWork floors, has a turf-covered area with CrossFit-like equipment, a large boxing studio that is heavy with heavy-bags and a cardio room for boot-camp workouts. To extend into WeWork's overall emphasis on communal habitats, both the male and female locker rooms at Rise lead to a large Jerusalem-stone-tiled area with a coed hot tub and sauna, run by an attendant named Jonathan who gently reminds people taking calls in the sauna that smartphones can melt. ""It's a process of educating people,"" he said. As part of an introductory offer, the cost of joining Rise is $180 per month, although the cost of Rise will rise to $250 per month later in the fall.

Art & Design,Guggenheim Exhibit With Video of Dogs Trying to Fight Stirs Criticism,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/arts/design/dogs-fighting-guggenheim.html,"""The curators of the exhibition hope that viewers will consider why the artists produced it and what they may be saying about the social conditions of globalization and the complex nature of the world we share,"" the Guggenheim said in a statement posted on its website on Thursday.

The three-month show, ""Art and China After 1989,"" opens Oct. 6 in the New York City museum and will feature about 150 pieces of experimental art. Many works are deliberately shocking, including the signature piece, ""Theater of the World,"" which features live insects and reptiles scurrying under an overhead lamp.

But so far the backlash has centered on the video by the artists Sun Yuan and Peng Yu, the husband-and-wife creators of often stirring and unsettling work. (In 2000, their transfused blood was injected into the corpse of conjoined babies in the performance piece ""Body Link."")

""Shame on the 'artists' for using animals in their pitch for sensationalism,"" one reader wrote in the comments of a New York Times article this week about the Guggenheim show. ""Shame on you Guggenheim for prompting heinous animal cruelty under the guise of 'art.'""

The Met has a keen interest in Watkins' work and has staged exhibitions of his photographs in 1999 and 2014. It already owns some 250 of his images.

""It's a very big deal both in terms of the Met's collection of 19th century American art and the Met's collection of photography,"" said Tyler Green, the author of ""Carleton Watkins: Making the West American,"" (University of California Press) published this month. ""In one fell swoop they would be getting around 10 percent of the guy's high end oeuvre, which is an extraordinary percentage.""

In addition to their notable size, 14.5 x 21 inches, the images are also prime examples of the wet-collodion process of creating photographic negatives, a technique that was used less and less frequently in the late 19th century due to the invention of the gelatin process.

The Hispanic Society received the photographs in the 1920s from the museum's founder, Archer Huntington, whose father, the railroad tycoon Collis Potter Huntington, was a friend of Watkins. The photographs had not been exhibited at the museum and were deaccessioned because they were not part of its core mission. Mr. Codding said the sale garnered more than $1 million for the Hispanic Society, whose doors are now closed because the museum is in the midst of two-year renovation expected to cost about $15 million.","The Hispanic Society of America, which sold an important collection of photos by Carleton Watkins, says they are headed to the Metropolitan Museum.",27663299-7ebf-5477-99a2-523f1e4b15c3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/02/arts/02metgift-item1/02metgift-item1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=5260f50c0646826f6dcfb5e7787db93251786561c3eadfae777f909722e86e16&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The image of ship in port, &ldquo;N.

Style,How to Prepare Now for the Complete End of the World,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/style/rewilding-stone-age-bushcraft.html,"How to Prepare Now for the Complete End of the World

OKANOGAN COUNTY, Wash. -- When the end comes, some will not be waiting in a bunker for a savior. They will stride out into the wilderness with confidence, ready to hunt and kill a deer, tan its hide and sleep easily in a hand-built shelter, close by a fire they made from the force of their two palms on a stick. Four hours from the Seattle airport, in a valley called Methow, near a town called Twisp, Lynx Vilden was teaching people how to live in the wild, like we imagine Stone Age people did. Not so they could get better at living in cities, or so they could be better competitors in Silicon Valley or Wall Street. ""I don't want to be teaching people how to survive and then come back to civilization,"" Lynx said. ""What if we don't want to come back to civilization?"" Some people now are considering what it means to live in a world that could be shut down by a pandemic.

But some people are already living like this. Some do it because they just like it. Some do it because they think the end has, in fact, already begun to arrive. A couple of times a year, Lynx -- she goes by the name professionally, though it is not her legal name -- teaches a 10-day introduction to living in the wilderness. When I arrived for this program, Lynx ran to me, buckskins flying, her hands cupped tightly around something that was smoking. She held it toward my face. I closed my eyes and inhaled deeply. Confused, she moved her smoking handful to someone else, who blew on it lightly. It was an ember in a nest of seed fluff. Lynx was making fire.

The class may have been there to go ancient, but they brought very modern food requests. In a group of seven, one student was a strict carnivore -- Luke Utah, who likes a morning smoothie of raw milk, liver and egg yolk. Another was a vegan. One student said they were so sensitive to spice that even black pepper was overwhelming. One person was paleo, one was allergic to garlic, and one was gluten-free. Louis Pommier, a French chef turned backpacker, was bartering his skill for attendance. He nodded empathetically as he heard these restrictions but would go on to mostly ignore them. The first night he made a chicken curry. Many of the people who were there came feeling useless in their lives. Some had just quit their jobs. Lynx said many of the students who come for the monthslong intensives (another option) are divorced, or on their way to it. Several talked about feeling embarrassed at how soft their hands were, and how dependent they had gotten on watching TV to fall asleep.

""One day I was like, 'This is crap. We live month to month. We spend all our money on booze and coffee. We can't save like this. We can't live like this. We all talk about getting back to earth, but we didn't know anything about it.'"" After some time on organic farms, they found Lynx. They decided to stay for a six-month Stone Age immersion. ""We had to come with 15 tanned hides and five pounds of dried fruit and five pounds of dried meat,"" she said. Her partner Alex, who is 31 and who worked at a grocery store as a wine specialist, bought a property nearby. Now about a dozen young people live there. Epona's yurt is 16 feet around and 12 feet tall, with a small wood-burning stove. She built curved bookshelves along the wall. Most of her food and medicine is dried in jars. There is a cat named Kitty and a dog named Arrow. She identifies as an animist. ""People say, 'Oh when the apocalypse comes. ...' What are you talking about? It's here. I'm a collapsist,"" she said. ""I'm not invested in maintaining the comforts we have.""

The Heathens, as the group named themselves, sometimes call the cities they came from Babylon, all the same, all fallen. The biggest challenge, they've agreed, is that no one around them is old. ""Most of us are in our 20s and early 30s,"" Epona said. ""You start to see where the holes in society are, and our holes now are elders."" That night, Alex took a horse over the mountain to visit some friends, while Epona stayed behind to host. She made deer, squash, and root vegetables stew. They had vats of plum mead and got the sauna going. There are enough people on the hill for a variety of love triangles. Epona and Alex split. Now Epona is dating a young woman on the property. Alex grew up in Montclair, N.J., and inherited some money. He is bald, muscular and tattooed. He said he used to be more dogmatic about living primitive, but that is changing.

Roxanne, who is 26 and has bright curly red hair, was here for community, she said. She was working alongside Alex, rubbing salt into hides. She just moved a couple weeks ago and had been working at a coffee shop before this. ""You know, the thing about living the dream is it's really hard!"" she shouted, hauling another salt bag. There is a main house down the hill, with a land line that everyone shares. The place is decorated in skulls and massive birds. There is a buffalo strung out to dry outside and a tall stack of deer legs at the door. More fit and dusty young people lounged inside. They were roasting a deer leg. ""From a purely rational engineering mind looking at the trends in the data, exponent times an exponent, our utilization of natural resources is way beyond the natural carrying capacity of the earth, and we're seeing that in essentially ecosystem collapse,"" Matt Forkin had told me. ""In our lifetimes there is a very high chance we will see major social collapse. I do think there will come a time when these skills are practical for a large number of people."" Alex made a gesture toward the small town over the hill and down the road. ""Everyone is partying their final days away,"" he said.

""Some people don't get it, but I prefer this life,"" Joan said. ""No, I don't use toilet paper. I use moss and I like it better."" Together, in the wild, everyone had to soften. One night, one of the guys said something offensive about gender roles, and a couple of us got annoyed. Then we all had to stop arguing because there was no one else to be with. I started arguing about politics with someone. Instead of going away, he had cold contraband beer, and I had nothing better to do than learn more about him. My only entertainment was the people around me. It made them more interesting. ""Really coming back to nature means responding to the social responsibility too. Someone says you have this personality flaw, you can't just avoid them. You have to respond. You adapt,"" Epona said. ""Rugged individualism is a lie. Rugged individualism cannot survive."" ""There's a social skill set of working in a community,"" Luke Utah said.",Lynx Vilden teaches people how to live in the Stone Age.,e9e5c7d9-fa66-5f4f-bc40-0e280a615bc9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/02/style/Rewildingo/merlin_164062941_d234891c-96c7-4e56-a884-0c7e8615fb36-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=925681ded5d431befd923eb10747cc444db033387a67672e96be144ebc3eebb4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Lynx Vilden, in the wild.",e9e5c7d9-fa66-5f4f-bc40-0e280a615bc9,N24News/imgs/e9e5c7d9-fa66-5f4f-bc40-0e280a615bc9.jpg,15
Science,A Speedier Way to Catalog Human Cells (All 37 Trillion of Them),https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/science/cells-human-body-sci-rna-seq.html,"A Speedier Way to Catalog Human Cells (All 37 Trillion of Them)

There are some questions in biology that you'd think were settled long ago. For instance: How many types of cells are there in the human body? ""If you just Google this, the number everyone uses is 200,"" said Jay Shendure, a geneticist at the University of Washington. ""But to me that seems absurdly low."" A number of scientists like him want to build a more complete catalog. Yet there are an estimated 37 trillion cells in the human body. The traditional ways to identify cell types -- such as carefully tracing the shape of individual cells under a microscope -- are too slow and crude for the job. On Thursday, Dr. Shendure and his colleagues published a report describing a speedy new method for taking such a cell census. Instead of inspecting one cell at a time, they measured the activity of genes inside 42,035 cells at once.

Although still at an experimental stage, the method may become an essential tool for cataloging every cell type in the human body, experts said. ""It's a really important piece of work,"" said David M. Miller, a cell biologist at Vanderbilt University, who was not involved in the study. ""With this approach, you can do more for a whole lot less work, and a whole lot less money."" In the laboratory, scientists easily discern the difference between, say, a muscle and a nerve cell. But these broad categories encompass many different types of cells. A muscle cell might be a skeletal muscle cell, the kind you use to walk or lift a cup. Or it might be a smooth muscle cell lining your small intestines, making it ripple with contractions. Our hearts are built of special muscle cells all their own, known as cardiomyocytes. Even these come in different types. Some contract the chambers to pump blood, for example, while others conduct electric impulses around the heart.

Genetically speaking, all cells in the body are identical. They all carry the same 20,000 or so protein-coding genes. What distinguishes each type is the particular combination of genes the cell uses to make proteins. The first step in this process is making a copy of the gene in the form of a molecule called RNA. The cell uses the RNA molecule as a template to build a protein. Dr. Shendure and his colleagues reasoned that the distinctive collection of RNA molecules floating around inside a cell could provide clues about the cell's type. To measure that RNA, they developed a kind of molecular ""bar coding."" In the first step, the researchers pour thousands of cells into hundreds of miniature ""wells."" Each well contains molecular tags that attach themselves to every RNA molecule inside the cells. The process is repeated two or more times until each cell ends up with a unique combination of tags attached to its RNA molecules. Dr. Shendure and his colleagues then break open the cells and read the sequences of tags at once. The ""bar codes"" allow the scientists to see which genes are active in each cell. Cells of the same type should share many of those genes in common. ""We came up with this scheme that allows us to look at very large numbers of cells at the same time, without ever isolating a single cell,"" said Dr. Shendure.

He and his colleagues call their method sci-RNA-seq (short for single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing). To test it, they set out to classify every cell in a tiny worm, Caenorhabditis elegans. Scientists know more about C. elegans's cells than any other animal's. In the 1960s, the biologist Sydney Brenner made it a model for investigating biological development. Dr. Brenner and later generations of scientists tracked the worm's growth from a single cell to about 1,000 cells at maturity, classifying them into types with a microscope. Eventually, scientists plucked individual cells from the worm's body and painstakingly measured their DNA activity. Dr. Shendure and his colleagues decided to see how results from sci-RNA-seq compared to those from decades of research. They raised 150,000 C. elegans larvae and then doused them with chemicals that broke them apart into individual cells. (Each larva has 762 cells, not counting the cells that will become eggs or sperm.) They then tagged all the RNA in the cells. With the new method, the researchers were able to identify 27 cell types that had been identified in previous studies. But the team also was able to break them down into smaller groups, each with a slightly different pattern of gene activity. They identified 40 different kinds of neurons, for example, including very rare types. In few cases, only a single such neuron develops in each worm.

""I was excited because it worked extremely well -- they uncovered results that will be valuable for me and for the whole field,"" said Cori Bargmann, an expert on C. elegans at the Rockefeller University. Yet for now, sci-RNA-seq falls far short of capturing the full complexity of cell types, even in such a simple animal. Dr. Shendure and his colleagues could not match some of their clusters of neurons to a known type of cell, and they did not find most of the 118 different types of neurons that earlier studies have documented. ""We don't consider this a finished project,"" said Dr. Shendure. Dr. Bargmann and her colleagues are already trying to match Dr. Shendure's results to neurons in the worm. ""Of course, there is more to do, but I am pretty optimistic that this can be solved,"" she said. Sarah A. Teichmann, a cell biologist at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute who was not involved in the new study, said the report illustrated how fast the field of cell-typing has moved. In a review posted on the pre-publication service Arxiv, Dr. Teichmann and her colleagues noted that it was only in 2009 that scientists managed to measure gene activity this way in a single cell. They broke the thousand-cell barrier just three years ago. This exponential increase will be crucial to the success of the Human Cell Atlas, an international initiative of which Dr. Teichmann is a joint leader. The researchers plan to create a complete catalog of every cell type in the human body.","Many types of cells remain unknown, but researchers have discovered a faster way to group cells by function, paving the way for a complete census.",2caf0b03-0ce9-5363-9aba-8faece70ddf3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/22/science/22SCI-ZIMMER/22SCI-ZIMMER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=9831ea893008c90d5ee64018f34704f222e2ecbbdf74e3a2665de2effd45ddf3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A light micrograph showing Caenorhabditis elegans, a worm in which scientists used a new method to determine cell types.",2caf0b03-0ce9-5363-9aba-8faece70ddf3,N24News/imgs/2caf0b03-0ce9-5363-9aba-8faece70ddf3.jpg,2
Science,Spider Silk Is Stronger Than Steel. It Also Assembles Itself.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/04/science/spider-silk-web-self-assembly.html,"Pound for pound, spider silk is stronger than steel and tougher than Kevlar. But it doesn't start out that way. The silk starts out in a liquid form called dope (literally, dope). But in fractions of a second, this goopy, liquid slurry of proteins is transformed. And it doesn't just turn into a solid. On their way out of a spider's bottom, the protein building blocks in silk, called spidroins, fold themselves and interlace, creating a highly organized structure without guidance from any outside force. This remarkable process of self-assembly is about as strange as a garden hose spitting out a stream of perfect snowflakes. Scientists have spent years trying to mimic it in the hopes that it will someday revolutionize the construction of ultra-strong, sustainable materials. ""You can really generate materials with unique properties by exploiting this self-assembly process,"" said Ali Malay, a structural biologist and biochemist at the Riken Center for Sustainable Resource Science in Japan.

Dr. Malay doesn't yet have the entire process figured out. Neither does anyone else. But in a paper published Wednesday in Science Advances, he and his colleagues lay out a new way to tackle the spider silk puzzle, mimicking its orderly exit from the spinneret with chemical tools in the lab. A crucial part of spinning, the researchers found, requires the spidroins to separate themselves from the watery buffer that swaddles them inside silk glands -- a step that hyper-concentrates the proteins. An influx of acid then prompts the proteins to securely interlock. The paper uses a simplified laboratory model in place of real spiders. But the research is remarkable for providing a glimpse into the sausage-making behind silk spinning, ""from liquid dope to fiber,"" said Angela Alicea-Serrano, a spider silk researcher at the University of Akron who wasn't involved in the study. ""We've seen a lot of the beginning of this process and the end, but not the in-between."" The metamorphosis spider silk must undergo as it exits an arachnid cannot be overstated, said Anna Rising, a spider silk expert at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden who was not involved in the study. While still in the gland, spidroins have to stay suspended in a liquid form at ""really extreme concentrations,"" Dr. Rising said. ""It's viscous, almost like a toothpaste."" If the silk hardens too soon, it could clog the spider's glands with a nightmarishly webby form of constipation. Too late, and the arachnid might spew only shapeless liquid. That makes both timing and efficiency central to the silk-spinning process.

Luckily for spiders, millenniums of evolution have made spidroins versatile. The proteins, Dr. Rising explained, are structured like barbells: a long, disorderly string capped on each end by a bolt-like blob. In the silk glands, these barbells are thought to naturally pair up at one end, creating V-shaped duos that slosh around in the dope. To form the more stable architecture required of solid silk, the spidroins need to link up in chains, using the other ends of the barbells. That seems to happen under the influence of a couple of chemical cues, said Jessica Garb, a spider silk researcher at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell who was not involved in the study. As the spidroin slurry is extruded through a labyrinth of increasingly narrow ducts, the spider cells pump acid into the mixture, making the free ends of the barbells stick together. The journey through these tapering tubes also tugs and squeezes the silk into its final form. Dr. Malay and his colleagues found that this sculpting and self-assembly could not happen if the liquidy spidroins weren't dehydrated as they moved through the spider's anatomy. Further experiments showed salts made the proteins rapidly distance themselves from the liquid surrounding them, like oil and vinegar in a salad dressing. This allows the spidroins to more easily interact, said Cheryl Hayashi, a spider silk researcher at the American Museum of Natural History who wasn't involved in the study. Freshly thickened, the stew of spidroins then shapes itself into an increasingly stringy structure. The silk extrusion pipeline might sound a bit cumbersome. From an engineer's perspective, though, it's extraordinarily elegant, said Keiji Numata, a Riken scientist who led the study. Scientists can build superstrong polymers in the lab through brute force, coercing materials to come together in ways they otherwise wouldn't. But given the right ingredients, under the right conditions, the recipe that is spider silk essentially cooks itself. Researchers still don't know enough about this process to fully recreate it. There are also many ways to spin spider silk, which varies between species, and even within the same spider, Dr. Garb said. Although silks might be best known for their roles in web-building, they can also be used to lure mates, protect eggs or even help wayfaring spiders hitch a ride on a passing breeze. This study focused on the proteins found in dragline silk, which serves as a sort of bungee cord for spiders dangling from their webs or ceilings. ""But there's still a lot more that nature has figured out that we don't know about,"" Dr. Hayashi said.",Scientists are figuring out the chemical triggers that turn the liquid stored in silk glands into a solid that's tougher than Kevlar.,f3e3becc-bd0c-5569-a8f9-edd2441a79ef,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/04/science/04TB-SPIDERSILK/04TB-SPIDERSILK-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=5e9fd5d521485075e77980c2063415ea87c784f02a9b401cde114b04cc2d02bb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An Australian garden orb weaving spider.,f3e3becc-bd0c-5569-a8f9-edd2441a79ef,N24News/imgs/f3e3becc-bd0c-5569-a8f9-edd2441a79ef.jpg,2
Food,The Poundcake of Your Dreams,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/dining/poundcake-recipe.html,"The Poundcake of Your Dreams This buttery loaf has a moist, golden crumb, a creme fraiche tang and a texture just as light (or dense) as you like.
* None   Christopher Simpson for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Simon Andrews.

For a cook in the 18th century, the recipe for poundcake was obvious from its name: a pound each of butter, eggs, sugar and flour, beaten together and baked until done. Golden-topped, rich and flavored with a splash of rosewater or dash of mace, it was the tight-crumbed grandparent of every butter cake we bake today. Although the classic recipe needs no improvement, this hasn't stopped bakers from trying their best over the past few centuries. They've tweaked everything from flavorings (Irish cream, peaches and dulce de leche), to texture (lightening it with baking powder or baking soda), to increasing the moistness with buttermilk, cream cheese or heavy cream. Feel free to swap in sour cream for the creme fraiche here. Christopher Simpson for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Simon Andrews. And I kept all these variables in my head over the last few months, when I decided that this pandemic was the ideal time to come up with a poundcake recipe of my own. My loaf pan was already in near constant use, so why not give all that anxiety baking a more concrete goal? After testing (and eating) my way through more poundcakes than I'm comfortable admitting, I started to see a pattern in the recipes I liked best. They were all on the lighter, softer side of the poundcake spectrum, with some kind of sour or fermented element to mitigate the sweetness. I also liked a glaze on top, preferably one with a candylike crunch that shattered when you bit it before melting sweetly on the tongue. Gathering all these characteristics together in one loaf was the goal, and, many incarnations later, this creme fraiche poundcake is the result. Christopher Simpson for The New York Times. Food Stylist: Simon Andrews. Its golden crumb is velvety moist, with a decided tang from the creme fraiche (or you can use sour cream), and a pronounced character from your choice of vanilla extract or good dark rum. I adore the rum, and have a hunch that bourbon or Cognac would be excellent, too. As for texture, you'll notice that, in the recipe, I give a range of amounts for the baking powder. To me, 1 teaspoon makes as perfect a poundcake as poundcake gets, a bit airier than, say, Sara Lee, without floating into chiffon cake territory. But if, like my husband and daughter, your poundcake desires skew denser, use  1/2  teaspoon. The difference is subtle, but noticeable. Or try it once each way and decide for yourself.

Techno Classica, which celebrated its 25th anniversary this year, combines dealer exhibits with car-club displays and a classic-car auction by Coys, along with hundreds of vendors selling new and used parts, accessories, clothing, die-cast model cars, literature and manuals. Techno Classica may be the closest thing the classic car world has to an all-encompassing trade show. Consider the numbers: 2,500 cars on display, 234 participating clubs, 1,250 vendors and 1.3 million square feet of display space. Nearly 200,000 people attended over five days in mid-April.

Essen is in northwest Germany just 30 minutes by cab or train from the Dusseldorf airport. And while it's not Paris, Essen has its charms even though little of the old city survived Allied bombing in World War II. (The next Techno Classica is scheduled for March 26-30, 2014.) Some of the larger American shows, like the concours at Pebble Beach in California and Amelia Island in Florida, feature enthusiastic participation by new car manufacturers. But at Techno Classica, automakers' involvement is positively off the charts, with a strong presence by Alfa Romeo, Aston Martin, Audi, Bentley, BMW, Citroen, Ferrari, Ford, Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, Mini, Opel, Peugeot, Porsche, Volkswagen and Volvo. The companies' lavish displays suggested that they were all aware of the equity in their heritage. BMW's display was particularly impressive, celebrating the history of the ""M"" cars from its Motorsports division and the 90th anniversary of BMW motorcycles. And just to remind everyone of what country they were in, a giant beer tap was set up in the trunk of a BMW 502 sedan from the 1950s. The tap seemed to be in service nonstop from the 9 a.m. opening until the 6 p.m. close. Club displays ranged from the Spartan -- a few cars with owners and club members sitting nearby -- to the elaborate and often incomprehensible -- like a Borgward Isabella sitting in a large makeshift bathtub. The more humble displays tended to showcase autos, like the Trabant and Wartburg, from the former East Germany.

A great deal of what was on display would have been wholly unfamiliar to all but the most knowledgeable American enthusiasts, including the Borgward -- along with its companion Lloyd and Hansa marques -- and the cars of Glas and Bitter. The profusion of never-seen-in-America models from familiar marques like BMW, Volkswagen and Opel would hold the attention of a curious American enthusiast nearly indefinitely -- or at least as long as one could stare at a display of tiny Volkswagen Polo GTis and unfamiliar versions of the BMW 2002, like the Turbo and the Touring hatchback.

The number of vendors was remarkable even if some of the wares were rather standard swap meet fare. Every car show on the planet seems to have a guy selling a miracle metal polish that will make an empty soda can shine like a mirror. As one might imagine, given the location, Techno Classica was short on '57 Chevy grilles and long on Karmann Ghia bumpers and taillamps. One could pass the time staring into seas of red and amber taillamp lenses and puzzling over what cars they fit. One vendor specializing in rebuilt vintage radios claimed to have virtually every type of postwar Blaupunkt unit, with prices starting at a lofty $392 for a basic unit that appeared to have come from an old VW Beetle. Steering wheels, carburetors, interior fabrics and leathers were common. Aside from wares for popular German marques, quite a few British vendors offered parts and accessories for MGs, Triumphs and Austin-Healeys. Die-cast cars were available for nearly every make and model imaginable at prices ranging from $6.50 Chinese-made show specials to more than $1,300 for a meticulously handmade Auto Union Grand Prix car from the 1930s. The swap meet included a few rather chilling reminders of Germany's Nazi past. Hiding in plain sight among a group of innocuous grille badges from the 1950s and '60s was an enamel door plaque denoting that the occupant was an ""Ortsgruppenleiter der NSDAP"" -- a municipal leader of the Nazi party. The Nazi Reichsadler, or eagle, was affixed to the top of the plaque but a price tag of 80 euros strategically obscured the swastika in the eagle's talons. While it is generally illegal in Germany to display the swastika and other bits of Nazi iconography, this fact was apparently lost on the model aircraft seller who on the first day of the show displayed a large-scale replica of a Messerschmitt Me 109 fighter plane with a swastika on the tail. By the second day, the offending symbol had been covered up.

Shawn Dougan, the vice president for sales at Hyman Ltd., a St. Louis-based classic car dealer, was one of a handful of Americans in attendance this year, and his company was the only American dealer with a major exhibit. ""I can't figure out why this show is still such a well-kept secret in the U.S.,"" he said. ""It's the biggest and best car show on the planet, and one of the few opportunities we have to meet face to face with a lot of our European clientele. There really is nothing like it at home."" Mr. Dougan noted that the American collector-car hobby was fragmented into niches and subniches like hot rods, customs and restomods, ""and the various groups don't often have a lot in common."" Also, he said, Americans are more resistant to transporting cars and exhibits for long distances. ""Europe is a lot more compact,"" he said. ""A show like Essen can draw exhibitors from France, Belgium, Holland and the U.K. -- it's just a day's drive for most of them.""","The Techno Classica show, held each spring in Essen, Germany, is 25 years old and still a relative secret.

Art & Design,Shortlist of Architects Announced for Music Center in London,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/arts/design/shortlist-of-architects-announced-for-music-center-in-london.html,"Amanda Levete, Norman Foster, Renzo Piano, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Frank Gehry, Snohetta: The starriest of starchitects are on the shortlist to design London's new Center for Music, a future home for the London Symphony Orchestra and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.

All of the architects on the shortlist, which was announced Monday, have extensive experience working on cultural buildings. Ms. Levete, who heads the architectural firm AL_A, and is collaborating on the Center for Music proposal with Diamond Schmitt Architects of Canada, recently designed the extension to the Victoria & Albert museum in London. Diller Scofidio + Renfro is currently working on an expansion project for the Museum of Modern Art in New York as well as designing the Shed, a major new Manhattan cultural center.

Mr. Piano's France-based firm designed the just-opened Santander art gallery in Spain, while Mr. Foster's practice has designed the Carre d'Art in Nimes, France, and the Winspear Opera House in Dallas. Snohetta, a Norway and New York-based collaborative, has designed a theater for the Norwegian National Opera and Ballet, as well as the International Center for Cave Art in Montignac, France.

The eminence grise of the batch, Mr. Gehry, is known worldwide for his distinctive titanium-clad Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, as well as for the Walt Disney Concert hall in Los Angeles and the Vuitton Foundation in Paris.","Amanda Levete, Norman Foster and Frank Gehry are among the starchitects vying to design the future home for the London Symphony Orchestra.",9424c4f4-4345-5a42-b2aa-8a963a01cd09,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/10/arts/10CENTERFORMUSIC/10CENTERFORMUSIC-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=f801bf3923f26158dd7d668de85d0a3878415ce10eb772f3f1e38736853adf22&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Frank Gehry, Amanda Levete and Renzo Piano, some of the architects who made the shortlist to design London's new Center for Music.",9424c4f4-4345-5a42-b2aa-8a963a01cd09,N24News/imgs/9424c4f4-4345-5a42-b2aa-8a963a01cd09.jpg,14
Theater,"On Second Viewing, First Impressions Don't Always Hold",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/theater/second-viewing-digital-theater.html,"I hadn't expected Simon Stephens's ""Sea Wall"" to come to the rescue. Then suddenly there it was, saving me. A play that ran on Broadway just last summer, it also exists as a quietly gorgeous little film that feels like a gift from the past arriving exactly on time. Streaming free through Monday on YouTube -- and yes, you should start watching right now, I mean it, instantly -- it is electric somehow with the immediacy and catharsis that are so much of what we hunger for in live theater. And, red alert, it stars Andrew Scott. A young man's monologue of wonder and grief, ""Sea Wall"" is a dazzling piece of writing. It cracked me open all three times I saw Tom Sturridge perform it on Broadway, as half of the double bill ""Sea Wall/A Life.""

As we flock online in these isolated, uncertain days, looking to sate our theater cravings, a lot of us are watching plays we have already seen onstage -- familiar comforts that, in digital form, can bring fresh revelation, too. With theater vaults opening, the enticements just keep coming, including Simon McBurney's aural wonder ""The Encounter,"" streaming, free, May 15-22 on the St. Ann's Warehouse site; Lincoln Center at Home's free Broadway Fridays, June 5-19; and of course ""Hamilton,"" with the original Broadway cast, on Disney Plus starting July 3. Though virtual versions should first do no harm, it is easy to be disappointed by theater when we don't get to be, quite literally, in the room where it happens. Already one step removed from the vitality of live performance, the screen variety carries a risk of feeling like eat-your-vegetables viewing: good for you, maybe, but not as much fun as you'd like. That may be why the pleasure is so intense when it succeeds, as the exquisite ""Sea Wall"" does. Shot in 2011, and starring Scott long before he caused a stir as the hot, tender, tormented priest on ""Fleabag,"" it is devastatingly intimate. He nestles right into your soul as Stephens's Alex, a gentle, besotted husband and father who until very recently led a cherished, ordinary life.

What's remarkable is how well suited, in philosophy and form, ""Sea Wall"" is to this moment, and how almost unmediated it feels onscreen, viewed through a stationary lens. Alex, like all of us right now, has seen the once solid ground beneath him abruptly fall away. Stephens, who directed the film with Andrew Porter, wrote ""Sea Wall"" for Scott to perform onstage. After he did it in London and Edinburgh, they filmed it one day in a borrowed studio: the script the same, but spoken to a camera, not an audience. Even the airy setting seems to anticipate present anxieties. With natural light spilling through a wall of windows, Scott stands at what looks like a healthy distance from the camera. If it is very 2020 to take note of that, it is also reassuring -- and even more so when you know that the filmmakers shut themselves off from him, behind a screen, so that he would feel alone in the room. I warn you that this ""Sea Wall"" left me in a puddle of tears, but also feeling something akin to that hallowed sense of connection we get from live theater. I've watched it three times so far. And if I should want to experience Sturridge's performance again, too, the audio version of ""Sea Wall/A Life"" is on Audible. Shows that closed too soon When theater is shape-shifting in shutdown, trying to reach audiences digitally, it seems like a cheat to exalt a piece from pre-pandemic times. But a lot of what we're bingeing lately is: all those National Theater Live shows (including the stage version of ""Fleabag,"" streamable on Amazon, where you can also find the hot priest in Season 2 of the TV adaptation) and all the productions recorded right before stages went dark.

One of those is Lili-Anne Brown's Goodman Theater production of Jocelyn Bioh's ""School Girls; Or, the African Mean Girls Play."" Streaming through May 31 on the theater's website (tickets are $20), it is well worth watching if you haven't seen this brilliant, biting comedy onstage. Or if you just want to spend time with its characters again in 1980s Ghana. ""School Girls"" online can feel a bit distant, without the emotional punch the play packed Off Broadway -- and may have packed live in Chicago, before it was suspended in previews because of the pandemic. When cameras are directing your gaze, that can be hard to judge. There are some lovely performances, though, including Ciera Dawn's turn as Paulina, the queen bee with dreams of beauty-pageant glory. ""Hopefully,"" Brown says to the streaming audience, preshow, ""there will be an actual live opening sometime in the future."" Agreed. For now, her production gets to reach wider, open to all the world.

At Diversionary Theater in San Diego, what would have been the West Coast premiere of Miranda Rose Hall's ""Plot Points in Our Sexual Development"" was foiled by the shutdown, too. A video of its final run-through, which was online last month, made me wish the show could have gone on. ""Plot Points"" is a queer love story in the form of an intimacy exercise, and when it ran at LCT3 in 2018, there was a lecture-like chill to the production. Revisiting the play, I thought I would be in for something similar. But Kym Pappas's Diversionary staging, starring August Forman and Rachael VanWormer, exuded warmth and easy comedy. The script still bogged down toward the end in clinical dialogue, but until then it was captivating.",Watching familiar plays online can be a comfort — and sometimes a revelation.,cfb791a5-74c6-5437-8dea-1bf72f6b5436,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/15/arts/14secondview/14secondview-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=f27349801985b2752b8ad137c346cb5290c4f73b8d5181a15aaec044c243567b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Andrew Scott in the 2011 filmed version of ""Sea Wall,"" a short play by Simon Stephens.",cfb791a5-74c6-5437-8dea-1bf72f6b5436,N24News/imgs/cfb791a5-74c6-5437-8dea-1bf72f6b5436.jpg,10
Style,Polyamory Works for Them,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/03/style/polyamory-nonmonogamy-relationships.html,"Through a half-century of sexual upheaval, monogamy has been a curious stalwart. The tradition of having a single sexual partner is among the only sexual practices liberals and conservatives rarely disagree about. Its blandness belies mysterious origins: Scientists have yet to conclude why prairie voles, much less people, prefer to bond in long-term pairs. Yet in certain concrete burrows, monogamy's inverse is on the rise. Jade Marks, a 26-year-old artist and herbalist in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, recalled a recent post by a friend on Instagram: ""Are there any other queers out there who are monogamous?"" That feeling may have something to do with the immediate environment. Most weekends in New York, a smattering of events cater to the non-monogamous. There are lecture series, workshops and discussion groups. There are cocktail hours and meet-and-greets. And there are, of course, parties.

Inside were some of the happiest-looking sober adults ever seen after 2 a.m. ""It's like 'Eyes Wide Shut' meets a Gaspar Noe film,"" said a Scandinavian digital artist and recent Brooklyn transplant. He and his girlfriend were attending for the first time; they had read about the party, called NSFW, on the internet. NSFW caters to the 25-to-35 age bracket, has an all-black dress code and is made up of 60 percent women, according to its founder, Daniel Saynt. Its application for membership requires a social media profile link (""It's very curated,"" Mr. Saynt said) and responses to open-ended and check-box questions (""ultimate fantasy"" is a short answer; optional boxes to check include ""hedonist,"" ""daddy"" and ""label-less""). That may sound like the precursor to a job interview, but the point is to ensure that the needs of attendees are met. Wouldn't it be nice if other clubs worked that way? ""I don't think that polyamory is somehow more evolved than monogamy,"" said Zhana Vrangalova, a sex researcher who will teach an online course for couples and individuals seeking to open their relationships this fall. ""But it should be an option. People should have more options."" That was a maxim for the two dozen non-monogamous people interviewed for this article. The subjects, who represent a range of ethnicities, sexual orientations, gender identities and professions, agreed on this: For them, more partners means more exploration and more pleasure.

Consensual or ethical non-monogamy is an umbrella term that encompasses various relationship models, including polyamory, open relationships, sexual encounters with more than two people and swinging. Polyamorists are interested in exploring long-term relationships with multiple people. Swingers tend to be older couples opening their marriages recreationally. According to a 2014 Chapman University survey, 5 percent of American relationships identify themselves as non-monogamous. In a more recent survey of single adults in the United States, in 2017, one-fifth of respondents said they would try some form of non-monogamy at some point in their lifetime. In major cities, there are plenty of ways for non-monogamous and polycurious people to meet, among them apps, dinners, friends, blind dates and parties. In New York, organized sex parties include Chemistry, which requires a Q. and A. application and photo, but doesn't screen for a particular look; NYC Inferno, a gay play party that mostly attracts cisgender men but is open to queer, trans and nonbinary people (Playhouse, a spinoff event, revolves around trans guys); Skirt Club, a members-only club for bisexual women; and Wonderland, which welcomes everyone as long as they bring a buddy who will vouch for them, and are committed to fantastical dress codes (""Ancients vs. Aliens,"" ""Dungeons and Drag Queens"").

Now a cottage industry of coaches and educators has cropped up to help polyamorous partners strive for compersion, the happy-for-you alternative to jealousy. Effy Blue, a relationship coach in Brooklyn, works with all of the following: triads, or three people in a committed relationship together; individuals seeking to transparently date multiple lovers simultaneously; partners who each have intimate friends, all of whom are close; and clients cultivating long-term relationships with someone who already has a primary partner. ""There is no single model that suits everyone,"" Ms. Blue said. She also wrote a book on play-party etiquette. ""Consent is the cornerstone of any well-produced, healthy and fun sex party,"" she said. ""This makes it safer and more fun than an average nightclub on any given day."" Ella Quinlan, a 29-year-old event producer, said she knows hundreds of peers on the East and West Coasts practicing their own flavors of non-monogamy. In her own relationship with Lawrence Blume, a 55-year-old tech investor, Ms. Quinlan's goal is to enhance what is conventionally beloved about monogamy, she said. ""We want to show people that it's actually possible to be in a long-term, healthy, satisfying, deeply rooted and connected emotional relationship with somebody -- and do this,"" Mr. Blume said. It's not always easy. ""There's a lot of talking, and it takes a lot of work,"" said Jade Marks. When Jade began exploring non-monogamy with Tourmaline, Jade's primary partner, the pair quickly realized they had different expectations: Jade wanted casual encounters, while Tourmaline preferred sustained relationships with multiple people. It took a lengthy negotiating period. Boundaries helped: Jade and Tourmaline established safe sex guidelines, and a rule of not bringing any partners to the apartment they share, though Jade said they have ""a clause"" for unexpected encounters.

Karen Ambert, 35, met Kenneth Play, a 38-year-old sex educator, three years ago on an art bus that was touring their neighborhood of Bushwick. Two years later, Mr. Play introduced Ms. Ambert, an emergency-room physician, to the man who became her second boyfriend, Geronimo Frias, the co-owner of a parkour gym. It's not technically a triad, but a V, as the relationship configuration is known in the poly community. Mr. Play and Mr. Frias don't date each other, but they do date other people. (Mr. Play employs an assistant, in part to help book his rotating cast.) Polyamorous for most of her adult life, Ms. Ambert hid it from her colleagues in medical school and residency. ""I was always worrying about the next step. How will this impact my education and career?"" she said. But recently she has grown more comfortable in her professional standing, and felt ready to come out about her love life too. Mr. Frias was sitting on a couch at the home of Mr. Play with Ms. Ambert wedged in the middle, basking in the gaze of four adoring eyes.

Sexual repression is at the root of the wider public stigma about non-monogamy, said Narjesi Tragic, an environmental science student in Queens. But that's rapidly changing along with ""tolerance of different kinds of lifestyles, traditions, religions,"" said Orion Starbreeze, Narjesi's metamour (both date Tiana North, a professional dominatrix and dog trainer, but not each other). ""We're returning to that nomadic sharing of partners and resources,"" Ms. North said. ""There's ride shares, there's house shares, bike shares -- we're in a sharing generation now."" Which, for some, is easier to intellectualize than practice. ""The biggest obstacle to free love is the emotion we call jealousy,"" the sex educators Janet W. Hardy and Dossie Easton write in the 1997 edition of their book ""The Ethical Slut,"" which introduced many Americans to the concept of non-monogamy. One morning, I Skyped with Na'Im Najieb, a 33-year-old author, and Tyomi Morgan, 31, who is a sexuality coach. The two of them have been in an open marriage for a year and a half, and they recommend the use of mindfulness techniques to overcome jealousy.

""We're in an extremely happy situation, and yet with a future that's uncertain,"" said Mr. Frias, 41, who is discussing starting a family with Ms. Ambert. ""Being married and having kids in a V, I don't know anyone else personally who's done it."" The idea was spurred during a conversation between Mr. Play and Ms. Ambert. It started much like any couple's might, with Ms. Ambert saying she wanted children sooner rather than later, and Mr. Play hesitating. Then Mr. Frias was in the picture. Like Ms. Ambert, he, too, wants children. It was precisely her quality of ""accepting people exactly as they are,"" without trying to curtail their individual desires, that makes talk of such a long-term commitment possible, he said. ""I'm not trying to change anything about her, and she's not trying to change anything about me,"" he added.","Having multiple partners can mean more pleasure, but it's not always easy.",b43c9ca1-61d9-5d51-ae32-2451f3bca28b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/04/fashion/03THELOOK1/03THELOOK1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=61f88e8fae4fe3763899955c6db14a08dacbc2afccefa13debce1f73435a3e2d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Polyamory breaks a mind-set that Narjesi Tragic, right, calls &ldquo;the relationship escalator: meet at school, get married, have kids, continue until we get old.&rdquo; Here, Narjesi is pictured with Tiana North, whom they date, Orion Starbreeze, who dates Tiana but not Narjesi, and Mr. Starbreeze&rsquo;s partner Brat James.

Automobiles,"For Cars, Aluminum Is a Back to the Future Metal",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/automobiles/for-cars-aluminum-is-a-back-to-the-future-metal.html,"While the 2015 Ford F-150 is on track to become the industry's highest-volume aluminum-body vehicle -- and a breakthrough in pickup truck design -- it follows many earlier ventures in aluminum auto production. Since the dawn of the automobile, manufacturers have exploited the metal's advantages for reasons that include weight reduction, corrosion resistance and ease of recycling, which is why a growing number of luxury brands and sports cars rely on aluminum structures.

Studebaker, once the world's largest maker of horse-drawn carriages and buggies, according to the Studebaker National Museum in South Bend, Ind., built a farm wagon in 1893 whose metal components were largely aluminum -- considered a precious metal at the time -- as a showpiece for the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago.

The so-called Aluminum Wagon contained 149 pounds of aluminum -- all of the metal brackets and hardware, but not the springs or wheel rims. The wagon took more than 4,000 hours of labor to build and cost $2,110.65, a hefty premium over the $200 cost for a typical farm wagon. Other materials used in its construction included Brazilian rosewood and Indiana hickory.

""People on and off have been dabbling with aluminum going back to the beginning of the automobile,"" said Andrew Beckman, archivist at the Studebaker museum. ""This was Studebaker showing off what they could do technologically in the field of transportation.""","Automakers have long exploited aluminum's advantages for reasons that include weight reduction, corrosion resistance and ease of recycling. Studebaker even used the metal in wagons.",514811b3-7219-52a3-a8a7-5c4d42f1aa10,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/16/automobiles/autSKY4/autSKY4-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=381&w=600&s=ffdf9d9173b3d8e0f944d06de3280879a5745671c6012514367e85f535a47ea7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Studebaker's so-called Aluminum Wagon contained 149 pounds of aluminum — all of the metal brackets and hardware.

Your Money,"Once Again, the Estate Tax May Die",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/18/your-money/taxes/once-again-the-estate-tax-may-die.html,"People who disapprove of the estate tax sometimes call it a death tax, but in 2010 it received a more colorful nickname: the ""Throw Momma From the Train"" tax. Borrowed from the 1987 movie featuring Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito, that derisive label arose from an odd circumstance: The tax was suspended for 2010 but reinstated in 2011, allowing a reprieve for the estates of wealthy people who died that year. There is no indication that anyone took a homicidal cue from the movie, but some estates benefited from the tax's hiatus. When Dan L. Duncan, a Texas pipeline tycoon, died of a brain hemorrhage in March 2010, for example, his $9 billion estate escaped the tax. If he had died three months earlier, the estate could have faced a tax bill of up to $4 billion. The future of the estate tax is in debate again. President Trump promised to eliminate it during the campaign last year. ""No family will have to pay the death tax,"" Mr. Trump said at the Detroit Economic Club in August. ""It's just plain wrong and most people agree with that. We will repeal it.""

Whatever happens, statistics show that very few families actually pay the tax -- and those that do are subject to a series of interconnected other taxes. ""It's easy to say, 'Repeal the estate tax,' but it's like squeezing a balloon,"" said Alexander A. Bove Jr., an author and estates lawyer with Bove & Langa in Boston. ""Something has to give when you do that."" Estates are now taxed at 40 percent. But with an exemption of the first $5.49 million per individual -- and nearly $11 million per couple -- the average effective rate can be much lower. Using Internal Revenue Service data from 2013, the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center calculated that the average size of estates paying the tax that year was $22.7 million, and that they paid an effective rate of 16.6 percent. Few estates are large enough to require any payment. In 2015, only 11,917 estates filed I.R.S. Form 706, ""United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return""; 4,918 of them owed any tax, paying a total of $17.1 billion. ""This tax paid by very, very wealthy people and the rate they pay is reasonable,"" said Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy for the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""A lot of this money has never been taxed before. Working-class people pay payroll taxes every week, and for wealthy people that's not how it works.""

One big advantage the current estate tax gives to wealthy heirs is in the treatment of capital gains, which are taxed at a rate of 0 percent for anyone in the 10 and 15 percent income tax brackets, 15 percent for most others, and 20 percent for anyone in the top 39.6 percent bracket. But under current rules for estates, no capital gains are paid on assets up to the exempt level, and assets over that amount pass to heirs at the current market value, shielding them from tax on any gain in prices that may have already occurred. The I.R.S. found in 2015 that stock and real estate -- assets likely to appreciate -- made up more than half of all estates subject to tax. Resetting the cost-basis, or value, of an inherited asset can be an important benefit. ""The person who inherits it can sell it with no tax,"" Mr. Bove said. ""That's a big advantage when you combine it with the exemption of almost $11 million for a couple."" The estate tax has two siblings, the gift tax and the generation-skipping tax. The gift tax is imposed on any transfer of more than $14,000 in one year to any single individual. The total value of gifts given during someone's lifetime lowers their estate tax exemption. The generation-skipping tax applies to gifts larger than the estate tax exemption that go to anyone 37 years and 6 months younger than the gift-giver. It's devised to keep wealthy families from avoiding one generation of estate tax by transferring the money directly to grandchildren.

The Trump campaign's website sketched out a plan that would replace the estate tax with a tax on all capital gains held in an estate, with an exemption on the first $10 million of gains. There was no mention of the other two taxes. On Capitol Hill, the 35-page ""Built for Growth"" plan released in June by Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee calls for eliminating the estate tax and generation-skipping tax, but makes no mention of the gift tax. In January, the conservative Americans for Tax Reform called for repealing the estate tax but did not mention the others. Where this will end up is not clear, but it is fraught with complications. ""I think people wouldn't be as happy by repealing the estate tax if the gift tax wasn't also repealed,"" said Ronald D. Aucutt, a partner and co-chairman of the private wealth services group of the McGuireWoods law firm in Tysons Corner, Va. ""That would make the repeal bittersweet and leave some people wondering if these folks they voted for really did what they promised."" One longstanding criticism of the estate tax is that it can inflict harm on some family farms and businesses. If the value of farmland or assets held by a business grows over the years, estate tax may be due, even if the business lacks cash needed to pay the bill. While remedying that problem would be good tax policy, Mr. Aucutt said, it is not a very big problem. ""The impact of the estate tax on family farms and businesses, especially with an exemption of nearly $11 million a couple, has been overstated,"" he said. Very few family operations ever face the tax, said Chloe Cho of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, citing estimates from the Tax Policy Center.

In 2017 only 50 small businesses and farms will pay any estate tax and they'll only be paying, on average, 6 percent of their value,"" she said. ""They have enough to pay that without touching their businesses."" For those with estates large enough to merit the exercise, an estate plan can be completed in six months, including setting up trusts or transfers, experts say. The cost runs from $2,500 for a small, simple estate trying to stay below the exemption, to $10,000 or much more for the most aggressive plans, depending on how many individuals and entities are involved. ""Typically when people are this wealthy they're working with advisers and C.P.A.s and it's a whole strategy from their taxes to estate planning to gifting for the next generation,"" said Brian R. Jenney, a lawyer specializing in estates for the Kemp Klein law firm in Troy, Mich. ""If you're just a little bit over the exemption, it's not overly complicated, but if you've got $30 million or $40 million, you're going to end up paying estate tax."" Because the estate tax generates a meager 0.005 percent of annual tax collections, according to I.R.S. figures, it generates far more political debate than federal revenue. And among many tax planners, the calls aren't so much for reform as for stability, or at least a period of benign neglect. ""Just leave it alone so we can plan,"" Mr. Jenney said. ""But every administration seems to want to put their own twist on the estate tax.""","It has been a political issue for years. Now, President Trump wants to eliminate it, a move that would benefit the wealthy.",6aa0aecb-7668-55bb-bf06-bf7494de1256,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/19/business/19ESTATE2/19ESTATE2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=330&w=630&s=4e12be7f01c61b94f065cfd2e8afea76d18c1d0b799e0e3622ffd56f30787ef1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"When the estate tax was suspended in 2010, the one-year tax hiatus led many to think of ""Throw Momma From the Train,"" featuring Danny DeVito and Anne Ramsey.",6aa0aecb-7668-55bb-bf06-bf7494de1256,N24News/imgs/6aa0aecb-7668-55bb-bf06-bf7494de1256.jpg,21
Real Estate,"Robert E. Simon Jr., Who Created a Town, Reston, Va., Dies at 101",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/realestate/communities/robert-e-simon-jr-founder-of-reston-va-dies-at-101.html,"Robert E. Simon Jr., a New York real estate developer who founded Reston, Va., in the early 1960s as America's first planned alternative to the postwar suburban sprawl of commuter towns with cookie-cutter houses on look-alike streets, died on Monday at his home in Reston. He was 101. His death was confirmed by his stepdaughter Lynn Lilienthal. At a time when millions were fleeing crowded cities for what some sociologists called a colorless life in suburbia, Mr. Simon envisioned a Northern Virginia community that blended the serenity of an Italian hill town, the urban attractions of San Francisco's Embarcadero and the social equality of a utopia in Finland. Heir to a fortune, he sold his interest in Carnegie Hall, and in 1961, assembled financing and bought some 7,000 acres of woods and fields in Fairfax County, 20 miles west of Washington. He laid out a town of open spaces, homes and apartments that would be affordable to almost anyone, racially integrated, economically self-sustaining, pollution-free and rich in cultural and educational opportunities. He planned seven shopping plazas, each serving a ""village"" of 10,000 to 12,000 residents; 35 houses of worship; 21 schools; an industrial park to employ half of Reston's work force; and a downtown area with transportation, medical, hotel and entertainment facilities. Reston -- its name incorporated its founder's initials -- would also have a 35-acre artificial lake surrounded by town houses, shops and recreational green spaces.

By 1965, the first village had been built; 400 pioneers, including Mr. Simon, had moved in, and a dedication was held. ""The result unveiled today is one of the most striking communities in the country,"" wrote Ada Louise Huxtable, then the architecture critic for The New York Times. ""High and low buildings, commercial and residential construction -- all traditionally rigorously separated in suburban zoning -- share the land."" But by 1967, Reston had run short on money, and the idealism that had drawn many of its original residents had begun to fade. The Gulf Oil Company, a major financial backer, took over. Mr. Simon was forced out, and many of his ideas were dropped. ""This country's most closely watched new community changed from one man's dream to a corporate subsidiary,"" a dismayed Ms. Huxtable wrote. ""What has been accomplished in Reston has been done in a society hostile to planning and public development, ignorant of urban design, unsympathetic to architectural quality, suspicious of housing innovation as investment, long on words and short on funds."" But Mr. Simon was more hopeful. ""The planners of Reston were neither arrogant nor presumptuous enough to conceive of their task as the building of a utopia,"" he said. ""But it was and is hoped that something a little closer to the heart's desire than is now available for most people would be made possible.""

Reston thrived and inspired a revival of community planning in the United States. Some planned towns, like Columbia, Md., near Baltimore, flourished. Others, like Riverton, N.Y., south of Rochester, did not. Reston did not quite become the community Mr. Simon had envisioned, but it grew into a vibrant suburb of Washington, another planned city of great expectations. ""It's difficult to overcome the culture that we live in,"" he told The Washingtonian magazine in 2009. ""It's a culture where a state-of-the-art bathroom and kitchen are what one needs, plus enough square footage to show everyone that one could afford it.

""We've gone a couple of centuries without understanding community. It's too bad it's so hard to communicate what pleasure one gets from living with one's fellow human being."" Robert Edward Simon Jr. was born in New York City on April 10, 1914, one of four children of Robert Sr. and Elsa Weil Simon. His father was a real estate investor whose properties included hotels, apartment and commercial buildings and Carnegie Hall, acquired in 1925 from the widow of Andrew Carnegie. Robert and his sisters, Betty, Carol and Helen, were raised in Manhattan and spent summers on Long Island at the family's country home in Bay Shore, on a ranch in Arizona or vacationing in Europe. He graduated from Horace Mann School in 1931 and from Harvard in 1935. After his father died in 1935, he became president of Simon Enterprises and president and part owner of Carnegie Hall. A music lover and piano player, Mr. Simon sustained the hall's concerts for 25 years, despite financial difficulties. He was married four times, first in 1939 to Helen Douglas Adam. They had two children, Paul, who died in 1996, and Margo. His first wife died in 1959. His second marriage, to Anne Wertheim Langman in 1960, ended in divorce. His third marriage, to Dorothy Monet in 1973, ended in divorce in 2004.

Besides Ms. Lilienthal, survivors include his fourth wife, Cheryl Terio-Simon; his daughter, Margo Prescott-Morris; four other stepdaughters, Dr. Karen Terio, Betsy Schulberg, Deborah Lesser and Cristina Zilkha; two stepsons, Tom Langman and Adam Terio; and many grandchildren, great-granchildren and great-great-grandchildren. Mr. Simon joined the wartime Army in 1942 and became a captain, served two years in Europe and mustered out in 1946. After the war, he and his family lived in Syosset, on Long Island, and chafed at commuting and driving their children to activities. In the 1950s, Mr. Simon developed real estate in New York, California, Texas, Pennsylvania and Canada. By 1960, one of his prized assets, Carnegie Hall, had fallen on hard times and faced demolition. Mr. Simon sold his 40 percent interest to New York City in a deal that rescued the concert hall and helped finance his plan for the creation of Reston. Mr. Simon worked on other development projects, including Riverton, and was honored at periodic ""founder's day"" celebrations in Reston. He returned to live there permanently in 1993. In 2004, a bronze statue of him was erected in a central plaza in Reston, and in 2009 the Virginia Legislature commended his ""visionary leadership."" Mr. Simon celebrated his 100th birthday and Reston its 50th year in 2014. He was still remarkably active, attending celebratory events, walking about and chatting with friends. Nearly everyone in Reston knew him as Bob. By then, it was a city of 60,000, a racially integrated, economically diverse mix of urban and suburban lifestyles, with high-rise apartment buildings, town houses and single-family homes; youth and senior centers; swimming pools; tennis courts; woodland paths; lakeside shops; industries and businesses. In 2012, CNN Money magazine ranked Reston seventh on its annual ""Best Places to Live in America"" list. ""It's pretty close to what I had hoped it would be,"" Mr. Simon said.","Mr. Simon, a New York real estate developer, planned the town in the 1960s as an alternative to postwar commuter towns with cookie-cutter homes.",f58fc2ce-7b77-5f30-b68d-eab71d20e6f4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/22/business/22SIMON-OBIT/22SIMON-OBIT-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=406b532efc64bd709c70bbd078352384a9b809beb01d2f152cbc45bed5576b5d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Robert E.

Your Money,Retirement Plans Thrown Into Disarray by a Divorce,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/28/your-money/late-in-life-divorce-can-disrupt-retirement-plans.html,"AFTER enduring a divorce four years ago, Mike Miller's vision for a golden retirement got an unexpected makeover. Mr. Miller had been married for more than 30 years, and now he was single. His longtime dream of a shared retirement was shattered. He was also facing another unwelcome outcome: living in a smaller home and taking fewer vacations. ""The financial belt needed to be tightened,"" said Mr. Miller, now 61 and managing director of Integra Shield Financial Group in Minnesota. ""It doesn't go around as well."" Like Mr. Miller, more Americans are going through so-called gray divorces and the downsizing that follows. The divorce rate in the United States among people 50 or older has doubled since 1990, according to a study by the National Center for Family and Marriage Research at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. And as the American population steadily ages, gray divorces will keep rising: By 2030, it is estimated that 800,000 will occur annually.

Besides causing depression and dashing dreams, these divorces can sabotage retirement plans as assets are cut in half and expenses as a divorced single rise. For some older people, emerging from divorce with retirement plans intact can be challenging. ""There isn't much time left to enhance portfolios post-divorce,"" said Susan Brown, co-director of the National Center for Family and Marriage Research. ""So you have to be careful to get the best settlement you can. Some people may have difficulty recovering."" One solution, she added, is ""having a really good attorney and fighting for your fair share."" Spouses over 50 often bring fat pensions and defined-contribution plans to the table, making some settlement fights especially ugly, experts say. But failing to battle for your share can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars more down the road, said Emily Widmann McBurney, a partner at Kegel McBurney in Atlanta. A lot of people are leaving money on the table by overlooking some of these assets, she added. At the same time, newly divorcing couples may feel stress and depression, which can complicate decision-making. ""One likely result is that people delay making important financial decisions,"" said Michal Ann Strahilevitz, professor of marketing and behavioral economics at Golden Gate University in San Francisco. ""Very often the result is a downsized living standard."" The key, she added, is making sure the divorce isn't an ugly one, which could make wise financial decisions even harder. Mr. Miller agreed. He faced some of the same emotional drains juggling divorce and retirement planning. ""Your focus isn't there,"" he says. ""It's on a failed relationship and on being done with the process.""

To avoid this emotional logjam and negotiate a better settlement, experts suggest hiring a financial planner even before finding a good divorce lawyer. These planners can help divorcing spouses navigate a maze of retirement plan laws, make cash-flow forecasts and maximize tax-free distributions.
* Locast, a nonprofit streaming service for local TV, is shutting down
* Capital One's chief executive was fined after being called a 'repeat offender.' This financial prowess is needed early in the battle over retirement nest eggs. The inventory of assets that couples make when disclosing their investments is one example. Sometimes, esoteric assets like deferred-compensation plans or stock options may be overlooked or misunderstood in the inventory, Ms. McBurney said. Or the highest-earning spouse may unknowingly forget some assets. ""Post-divorce, you may discover that an ex-spouse had a leftover pension from a job long ago or from military service,"" Ms. McBurney said. ""Later, you may not be entitled to the income from those assets."" Some people get around that, she said, by adding a clause to the divorce settlement agreement that says assets discovered later will be divided in half. Fights are more contagious around retirement assets, Ms. McBurney said. She counsels that haste is a terrible mistake. She suggests hiring forensic accountants or other experts, if you need them, to find additional assets, which may be hidden. ""There's no do-over,"" she added. Once on the inventory, defined-contribution plans and pensions offered by employers are usually divided by using court orders called qualified domestic relations orders, or Q.D.R.O.s. They may be included in the divorce settlement agreement that splits up retirement plan assets, said Louise Nixon, president of QDRO Counsel, a California firm that focuses on the division of retirement benefits. But Ms. McBurney said it was important to make sure the orders were accurate and appropriate for your individual situation. Errors can be costly. Often the standard form used for administrative purposes by an employer will need to be modified by a lawyer to suit an individual settlement.

""Attorneys should know enough to read the Q.D.R.O. forms and adjust them,"" Ms. McBurney said. ""The slightest word change can make all the difference."" Taxable issues can also reduce seemingly hefty retirement plan assets. Defined-benefit plans, for example, are usually taxable when a person receives the funds, said Tom Rowley, a director of retirement business strategy at Invesco Consulting. These assets aren't taxed, however, if they're put into another retirement account. So look at the taxes owed on an investment, he said. Even alimony can be more complicated than it might seem at first. People forget that alimony is taxable, said Jeffrey Landers, a divorce financial strategist at Bedrock Divorce Advisors in New York. And retirement plan assets may be neglected in the battle for present income. ""People don't think of streams of income 10 years from now,"" he said. ""But they end up regretting it."" Alimony is usually only a short-term income solution, since it typically ends after a former spouse dies. Instead, people go after emotional assets like a house, Mr. Landers added, even though they may not be able to afford it. Or they just throw up their arms and want to move on, he said. ""But you need to think of gray divorce as a business transaction,"" he said. ""You need to crunch the numbers."" Social Security is one of the least-disputed retirement assets, but even it can be overlooked. When there's a significant disparity in an ex-spouse's income and yours, look into collecting half of the higher-earning ex-spouse's benefits, said Angela Deppe, founder of Social Security Central. There are some qualifications -- being married for at least 10 years, for example -- but many people don't realize they can be eligible, she said. Women typically collect their husband's benefits since they're usually higher, but she added that if you remarry, you may lose the ex-spouse's Social Security benefits. As for moving on after divorce, Mr. Miller advocates building a life plan that lets you live the best life possible with your available resources. The plan should also be aligned with your purpose, meaning, values and principles. ""Divorce woke me up to answering questions like 'What do I want my life to be?' "" he explained. The lesson in gray divorce, Mr. Miller said, is realizing that the ship isn't sinking. ""You're just steering a new course.""",Getting a divorce late in life can sabotage retirement plans as assets are cut in half and expenses as a divorced single rise.,39c40d9d-c2bf-583e-b494-dfffc3e4d714,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/28/business/Retiring/Retiring-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=408&w=600&s=31f51c23c2e18b12ae33d7d03ab74d80e34801d53da8d2cfb6d3b2fa0a951553&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Mike Miller, 61, has had to downsize his retirement plans after he and his wife of more than 30 years divorced four years ago.",39c40d9d-c2bf-583e-b494-dfffc3e4d714,N24News/imgs/39c40d9d-c2bf-583e-b494-dfffc3e4d714.jpg,21
Real Estate,Shopping for Outdoor Accent Tables,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/realestate/shopping-for-outdoor-accent-tables.html,"Lounge chairs get all the attention when it comes to shopping for outdoor furniture. But without a side table nearby, it's hard to enjoy lounging.

Other reasons you might want a small table outside? ""You can add an outdoor lantern or lamp,"" Mr. Williams said. ""Or a garden ornament or beautiful flower arrangement,"" to decorate your outdoor space.

Some outdoor accent tables are also strong enough to function as additional seating when you entertain (and may be marketed as multifunctional stool-tables).

Real Estate,November Sales Included Liv Tyler's West Village Brownstone,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/06/realestate/november-sales-included-liv-tylers-west-village-brownstone.html,"Liv Tyler has parted with her longtime home in the West Village. The actor and former model, who relocated to London last year with her family, sold her fully restored, four-story brownstone at 255 West 11th Street for nearly $17.5 million. The sale, done privately, was one of the top closings in New York City in November. The largest closed sales, once again, took place at 220 Central Park South, where two full floors sold, for $64.1 million and $59.6 million. The month's priciest co-op closing, at $47 million, was a palatial apartment at 960 Fifth Avenue acquired by Aerin Lauder, a granddaughter of the cosmetics giant Estee Lauder. In other notable November transactions, George Cheeks, who oversees late-night television at NBC Entertainment, traded one penthouse for another in Midtown. On the Upper East Side, the investment banker Thomas Unterberg sold a townhouse, while Jon Steinberg, the founder of the video streaming service Cheddar, bought one. Ms. Tyler became somewhat of a fixture in the West Village after buying her brownstone in 2001. Shortly after the purchase, she undertook an extensive restoration of the building, which had been carved into apartments, with the help of designers and architects at Fairfax & Sammons Architects, including Ben Pentreath, who later worked on the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's flat in Kensington Palace.

In a tour of the home last summer with Architectural Digest, Ms. Tyler explained how she gutted the building and meticulously renovated the space with many architectural details reminiscent of the late 1800s, when the house was built, along with modern flourishes. ""This home is special to me,"" she said, without any hint that she might be selling, ""because I bought it when I was in my early 20s."" The property features a lush garden with a large blossoming magnolia tree in the rear, off the kitchen. The parlor level, just above, contains a large living room with a fireplace and a library separated by pocket doors, which were used throughout the house. The bedrooms for the children (she has two sons and a daughter) were on the next level. The master suite encompassed the entire top floor and included an en suite bath with subway tile accents and a dressing room with hand-painted de Gournay wallpaper. There's also an attic, where Ms. Tyler kept her film memorabilia, including a sword from the ""Lord of the Rings"" series in which she had starred. But her secret ""favorite place,"" she said, had been the laundry room in the basement, which was once ""like a dungeon.""

Last year, Ms. Tyler and her fiance, Dave Gardner, a British sports and entertainment manager, bought a townhouse in London. According to public records, the buyer of the Manhattan house was a limited liability company with an address linked to an East Hampton address, once owned by the fashion designer Betsey Johnson. There were several sales in the tower at 220 Central Park South in November. Karsten Moran for The New York Times The latest big sales at the 220 Central Park South were apartments on the 46th and 49th floors of the tower, between Columbus Circle and Seventh Avenue, with the higher-floor unit the pricier of the two. These sponsor apartments, each 6,591 square feet, are similarly configured, with five bedrooms, and six full and two half baths, according to the offering plans. Each also has two small balconies facing Central Park and a huge master suite featuring two spacious dressing rooms and two baths. The buyer of the 49th-floor unit was listed as K & J Assets (US) Inc., with an address in Hong Kong. The purchase was financed with a $37.8 million mortgage. Monthly carrying costs total $26,186, according to the listing with the broker Deborah Kern of the Corcoran Group. Public records listed the buyer of the 46th floor as the limited liability company CPV46 of St. Petersburg, Fla.; that purchaser also picked up a 519-square-foot unit for around $1.9 million. Also selling last month was a 10th-floor apartment in the 18-story villa building, directly facing the park, (with the 65-floor tower rising behind it). This sponsor unit, at nearly 4,000 square feet, has four bedrooms, three and a half baths and a small balcony. It was purchased for $46.5 million. And a 3,222-square-foot sponsor apartment on the 54th floor of the tower closed at $26.2 million. That unit has three bedrooms, three and a half baths and a small balcony. Both were acquired through limited liability companies.

The month's biggest co-op sale was a stately unit on the 10th floor of the 12-story 960 Fifth, at East 77th Street, designed by Rosario Candela in the late 1920s and considered one of the city's grandest apartment houses. The residence had been the longtime home of C. Douglas Dillon, Treasury secretary in the Kennedy administration and ambassador to France under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He died in 2003. It was sold by Mr. Dillon's estate to Ms. Lauder, who is the founder of Aerin, a beauty, home and luxury lifestyle brand that she started in 2012. Ms. Lauder will get a chance to put her home-design chops to good use in this 13-room residence, which has five bedrooms and six full baths and comes with a storage room, as well as panoramic views of Central Park and the city skyline. The home is entered through a spacious formal gallery that opens to the entertainment spaces -- a living room, library and formal dining room adorned with ornate fireplaces and decorative moldings, according to the listing with Sotheby's International Realty. The south wing contains the main bedrooms, each with an en suite marble bath. The staff quarters and kitchen are on the north side.

A five-story brownstone on East 64th Street, a block from Central Park, sold for $9.7 million. Mr. Steinberg of Cheddar, who is also a former president of BuzzFeed, and his wife, Jill Steinberg, were the buyers. The seller used a limited liability company in the transaction. The fully renovated house, built in the late 1800s, has around 7,500 square feet of space. It features five bedrooms, five and a half baths, a family room and eight fireplaces. Outdoor space includes a large roof deck, a patio off the kitchen and a terrace on the third floor, where the master suite is situated. Several more apartments sold at 15 Hudson Yards, the first residential building to open in the megaproject. The largest of these sales, at $8.5 million, was a three-bedroom, three-and-a-half bath unit. The Fifth Avenue apartment of Eugene M. Lang, an investor and philanthropist who famously promised to pay the college tuition of sixth-graders in Harlem who completed high school. He died two years ago, and his fourth-floor co-op unit at 912 Fifth was sold by his estate for $3.3 million to Ronald Peltier, the founder and former chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway's HomeServices of America. And then there's what you might call a ""model"" apartment in TriBeCa. This 4,215-square-foot loft, at 44 Laight Street, near Hudson Street, comes with its very own custom steel catwalk, along with three bedrooms, two full and one half-bath, and a glass-enclosed media room. (The catwalk provided a whimsical connection from a billiards room to the media room, both on raised platforms.) The apartment was sold for nearly $4.7 million by Cory Margolis, an owner of Mantiques Modern in Chelsea, and Jacqueline Margolis. The buyers were Samuel Hayden Powell and Elyssa Beth Kaplan.

Editors for SB Nation, a sports website owned by Vox Media, removed the piece about five hours after it was published, and one editor called it ""a complete failure"" in an editor's note.

Mr. Arnold, a veteran freelance sportswriter, said in a statement that his intention was to present ""a more fully rounded portrait of Mr. Holtzclaw than had appeared in the press"" and investigate ""what could have led to him to become a convicted rapist and sexual predator.""","Jeff Arnold drew outrage after writing a piece many saw as sympathetic to Daniel Holtzclaw, who was convicted of sexually assaulting women while on duty as a police officer.",7c9fec7d-3443-54b1-a073-ae436dcf89db,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/22/business/23xp-sbnation1/23xp-sbnation1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=a40d01dcdb9ef26d72f5103cd39eb437b041b802fd4cfc402bfccfd53e7d438b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Daniel Holtzclaw, center, a former police officer, during his sentencing in January in Oklahoma City.",7c9fec7d-3443-54b1-a073-ae436dcf89db,N24News/imgs/7c9fec7d-3443-54b1-a073-ae436dcf89db.jpg,16
Movies,Wakanda for Oscar?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/movies/black-panther-oscars-ryan-coogler.html,"Credit...Rozette Rago for The New York Times



On a Thursday evening in October, as the Oscar campaign for ""Black Panther"" began to unfurl, Kathleen Kennedy took the microphone in a packed room of award voters. The Lucasfilm president had volunteered to host a reception for ""Black Panther"" at the London hotel in West Hollywood, and her eyes alighted on the 32-year-old director Ryan Coogler. ""Ryan Coogler's dreams and courage have made 'Black Panther' one of the most significant films to be released in the last decade,"" said Kennedy, who noted that the critically acclaimed superhero movie has grossed well over a billion dollars, smashing preconceived notions of how a black-led blockbuster could be received across the world. ""Ryan, you are a good man with a good heart,"" Kennedy said, quoting from the film. ""And it's hard for a good man to be a king."" Several feet away, Coogler's wife, Zinzi, and the Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige beamed with pride. Coogler, on the other hand, looked like he wanted to sink through the floor.

Other directors might bask in accolades, but Coogler, a high school football star who switched vocations in college to pursue a film career, has never quite shaken the humility drilled into him by sports. ""It's so rare to get compliments from your coaches,"" he said. ""You're kind of trained to not hear that, and even on a touchdown, you want to hear your coach say, 'You should have stuck your foot down earlier than you did.'"" When it comes to award season, Coogler is of two minds on the subject. ""You don't ever want to get too comfortable sitting in rooms and listening to people telling you how great the work is,"" he said. At the same time, Coogler is aware that if ""Black Panther"" scores major Oscar nominations, it could open the door for more directors of color. To what extent should he play the game? Coogler's friend, the director Ava DuVernay, said, ""Many of us are conflicted about what award season is and what it means, even more so when we tell stories of a certain kind, and when we're filmmakers of a certain kind."" Only a handful of black directors have been nominated for an Academy Award, and never more than one in the same year.

This season, another prominent contender is the ""BlacKkKlansman"" director Spike Lee, an idol of Coogler's with whom he could make Oscar history. Still, the fact that Lee has never before been nominated for a best director Oscar says plenty about why Coogler is justifiably wary of award season and why, it's rumored, he turned down the invitation to become an academy member himself. (When asked about it, he wouldn't say.) Just a few years ago, Coogler and Jordan earned Oscar buzz for their ""Rocky"" revival ""Creed,"" yet the only person nominated from the film was Sylvester Stallone, one of 20 all-white acting nominees in 2016, the second consecutive year of #OscarsSoWhite. Decision makers at the academy have taken great pains since then to diversify membership, but will they come around on Coogler? Despite the fact that he has made a landmark film, organizations like the Golden Globes and the Directors Guild of America have so far excluded the ""Black Panther"" director from their final five. True to form, Coogler is less concerned with his own chances and would rather take advantage of this award season to tout the contributions of his crew, many of whom would also make history if they find favor with Oscar. ""I'm not a painter or a novelist -- I work in an art form where I have a lot of help,"" Coogler said. ""I've got hundreds of people helping bring this film to life, and a lot of people on the street don't know that.""

Coogler, too, likes to surround himself with accomplished women, and the crew of ""Black Panther"" is unusual among blockbusters for its large number of female department heads. They include the director of photography Rachel Morrison and production designer Hannah Beachler, who both worked on Coogler's first feature, ""Fruitvale Station,"" as well as Ruth E. Carter, the veteran costume designer responsible for Wakanda's striking looks. ""We liked to joke that we were his Dora Milaje,"" said Morrison, referring to T'Challa's female bodyguards. ""Me and Hannah would probably both take a bullet for him."" The 40-year-old Morrison, who became the first woman ever nominated for a cinematography Oscar last year, for ""Mudbound,"" is also the first female director of photography to work on a Marvel Studios film. Beachler, 48, was the first woman to work as a production designer for the superhero studio. ""I loved looking around every day at all these women in positions we've worked so hard to get to,"" Beachler said. ""Because of that, we worked extra hard for Ryan and for the opportunity we'd been given, but we can do this. We are professionals alongside our male counterparts."" The 58-year-old Carter has been working as a costume designer since Spike Lee's 1988 film, ""School Daze,"" yet the many female department heads of ""Black Panther"" felt to her like the start of something new. ""We cut past any of the normal bureaucracy of male dominance, where they may want to overtake the conversation or need to be leader of the idea,"" Carter said, praising Coogler's willingness to listen to women. ""You don't have to be overbearing to get your point to him -- he's open in that way. With that calmness and humility, the gate opens: 'Hello, I have this to offer.'""

Coogler is quick to duck credit for employing so many women in major roles. ""In each one of the circumstances where I've worked with these incredible filmmakers that happen to be women, they were the best people for the job,"" he said. Then why is it so hard for other directors to follow suit? ""I don't know that I get it myself,"" Coogler said. ""If you aren't opening up to find people who are truly the best, then that can limit you."" While the rest of Hollywood tries to make its film sets look more like the real world by employing inclusion riders, Coogler has simply hired diverse crews and casts all along. With collaborators like Morrison and Beachler, as well as actors like Jordan, Coogler sees what they have to offer and makes the industry see, too. ""But if you think that's easy, you don't know anything about Hollywood,"" DuVernay said. She noted that even before ""Black Panther,"" Coogler was using ""Fruitvale Station"" and ""Creed"" to center black men who are not periphery players but heroes, lovers, fathers and sons -- a rarity in this industry. ""He has this effortless thing about him,"" said DuVernay, ""this breezy quality that makes people feel comfortable even though he's pushing the envelope inside a system that does not make it easy to tell those kinds of stories."" Carter has another way of describing the director. ""He comes from Oakland, he wears his high fade with locs on the top, and he plays football so he has an athletic build, but he is a gentle spirit,"" she said. ""And a gentle soul is not something we're accustomed to celebrating in black men.""

Coogler goes about things differently. ""My experience is that most directors who lead with ego are not so secretly very insecure or self-conscious,"" Morrison said. ""Ryan's comfortable in his own skin and confident in who he is, and that allows him to turn to his D.P. and ask what she thinks of the script, or ask the writer what he thinks of the cinematography."" ""For Ryan, it's important to have a lot of different perspectives around the table, not just his,"" said Beachler. She recalled a moment on ""Black Panther"" when a line gave her pause and Coogler suspended shooting the scene to discuss her concerns. ""He took the time to make sure I felt good about it, and safe,"" Beachler said. ""And that does not happen on other sets."" For Coogler, this approach is common sense. ""The more angles you have when you're making something, the more it helps the film cut through, in my opinion,"" Coogler told me. ""I think that's why this is made for the audience, at the end of the day: Film is a collective experience."" It's been that way for Coogler ever since he grew up in the Bay Area, when his parents would throw movie-marathon house parties for him, his two brothers, and their cousins. ""I was watching high-quality stuff at an early age,"" Coogler said, crediting his mother, Joselyn, for helping him become a cinephile. ""We used to joke and call her IMDb, because before IMDb even came out, she used to say, 'You see that actress there in the back corner? She played this person in that TV show.'"" When Coogler speaks about the crucial people who have helped him develop as a filmmaker, many of them are women, including his wife, Zinzi, who weighs in on casting decisions, and a college teacher, Rosemary Graham, who encouraged Coogler to take up screenwriting and still reads many of his drafts. According to Jordan, his longtime friend and muse, giving female perspectives priority is a throughline that began in Coogler's childhood and extends throughout his work. ""The strongest warriors in Wakanda are the women, and the smartest,"" Jordan noted, likening that lineage to the matriarchies found in many African-American communities. ""That's how it is in our households and our culture, and that's what our family dynamic is made out of.""

Even today, Coogler continues to live in the Bay Area near his parents. ""I'm thankful to have a big family that's still honest with me,"" he said, noting that ""Black Panther"" pivots on the conflict between T'Challa and Jordan's orphaned Killmonger, both of whom he can sympathize with. ""The fundamental difference between those two characters,"" Coogler said, ""is that one grew up with a community that loved him and nurtured him, and the other had the opposite."" Having been so nurtured, perhaps it's no surprise that Coogler wants to pay it forward. In 2007, Coogler, about to begin film school at the University of Southern California, told the East Bay Times about what he hoped to achieve in Hollywood. Instead of settling down in Los Angeles someday, his goal was to bring the film industry back to the impoverished parts of Richmond and Oakland, where he grew up. ""It will be something the people can point to and kids can see it, saying, 'I can do that,'"" the young Coogler said then. As my coffee with Coogler concluded, I pulled the article up on my phone and noted that at the end of ""Black Panther,"" this is exactly what T'Challa does. After grappling with the Oakland-born Killmonger and coming to understand the crucible he was forged in, the young king flies to his defeated enemy's home city, where he starts a high-tech outreach center that will inspire the community. By making ""Black Panther,"" then, Coogler has moved through T'Challa to realize a long-held goal. As I told him that, Coogler blinked. ""That's a lot,"" he said, having never considered the connection. ""That's a lot."" And then he let out a laugh. It was a laugh I'd heard Coogler deploy every time he was paid a compliment, a laugh he uses when he doesn't know how else to react. And then, after letting himself take in the idea for just a moment, Coogler moved on. ""Hopefully, there's more to do,"" he said.","Director Ryan Coogler and his female department heads helped bring ""Black Panther"" to life.

Dance,Suzanne Farrell Ballet Plans to Close After 2017-18 Season,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/22/arts/dance/suzanne-farrell-ballet-plans-to-close-after-2017-18-season.html,"The Suzanne Farrell Ballet, a company known for keeping the legacy and choreography of George Balanchine alive at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, plans to close after the 2017-18 season, officials said Wednesday.

""I am very proud of what I have been able to do with my company over the past 15 years,"" Ms. Farrell, 71, said in a statement. She added: ""I love to teach, have always evolved as an artist and I live in the now.""

The company, which has performed annually at the Kennedy Center since 2001 and toured extensively, will close, and Ms. Farrell, its artistic director, will take on a new role as a teaching artist with the Kennedy Center, which plans to add more dance studios as part of an expansion that is scheduled to open in 2018. Ms. Farrell has begun informing her dancers.

The company was led by Ms. Farrell, an important muse of the great choreographer George Balanchine when she danced for him at New York City Ballet. It performed 65 ballets by Balanchine, Jerome Robbins and Maurice Bejart, and played a major role in preserving the Balanchine tradition.","The company was led by Ms. Farrell, an important muse of the choreographer George Balanchine when she danced for him at New York City Ballet.",ca49c422-679b-5d4b-9bb3-de234162b555,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/22/arts/22farrell-item/22farrell-item-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=448281b941e1a175eebf959b73bf349a44026fa25f5bedf1cfbe4edf33530bed&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Suzanne Farrell leading a rehearsal of George Balanchine's ""Diamonds"" in 2011.",ca49c422-679b-5d4b-9bb3-de234162b555,N24News/imgs/ca49c422-679b-5d4b-9bb3-de234162b555.jpg,6
Books,Imagining the Unhappy Life of Stan Laurel,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/books/review/john-connolly-he.html,"There is nothing surprising anymore about a sad clown.

So many melancholy tales have been told about the tortured lives of comedians that the pertinent question about a new story is not whether the entertainer is miserable but why. In his deeply researched historical novel ""He"" -- which recounts the tumultuous life and triumphant career of , the slender half of the double act of Laurel and Hardy -- the Irish mystery and thriller writer John Connolly proposes some options.

There's the long shadow of Charlie Chaplin, whose monumental success and undeniable genius torment Laurel, and the usual exploitation by Hollywood producers like the titan of silent comedy, Hal Roach. Then there's the amoral, demanding ""Audience,"" always capitalized and often ominous. ""The Audience will laugh at a cat being burned,"" one characteristically cynical line begins. ""The Audience will laugh because others are laughing.""

Written in spare, fractured prose from the perspective of a narrator who seems to be reporting from inside Laurel's mind, this odd and ambitious book is so dense with show-business detail that it may alienate nonfans. Even Laurel and Hardy lovers may be put off by its somber, experimental mood. Laurel, the British vaudevillian who successfully made the transition from the silent era to talking pictures, is the center of the story but his name is never mentioned. He is referred to only as ""he,"" a self-conscious flourish in a narrative preoccupied with the disconnect between public and private lives.

The novel begins with, and continually returns to, the end of Laurel's life. His mind is diminishing as he chases ""butterfly memories,"" which announce the subjective perspective of what follows. His partner, the American performer Oliver Hardy, comes off much better, a good friend whose loyalty provides Laurel's one emotional anchor in a life of transitory relationships.","John Connolly's ""He"" fictionalizes the career of one half of the Laurel and Hardy team.",8f0ec3ce-8d3f-5bf5-a573-fa2adead740f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/03/books/review/03ZINOMAN/merlin_138491421_818cd3c6-58b7-472b-99c0-92789c027799-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=2106b465312953573b0aa6f7fd9abd2616819b92d1f93a6d7ebc23d078bce191&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Stan Laurel,8f0ec3ce-8d3f-5bf5-a573-fa2adead740f,N24News/imgs/8f0ec3ce-8d3f-5bf5-a573-fa2adead740f.jpg,13

Travel,"In Granada, Spain, the Tapas Bar Scene Gets Fresh Life",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/travel/granada-spain-where-to-find-tapas-bars.html,"The arrival of tapas on a weekday afternoon last April at Tinta Fina, a restaurant in the heart of Granada, Spain, happened leisurely. A heaping plate of cuttlefish fritters, glistening with oil, arrived with the first glass of wine, a Spanish rose. With the second glass, this time a crisp white from the country's Galicia region, the bartender presented cubes of manchego cheese and a pile of anchovies marinated in a peppery olive oil. Another drink and, an hour later, we were onto meaty rings of fried calamari and hunks of crispy dogfish. We hadn't ordered any of these tapas, but in Granada, locals rarely do. In a culture almost unique to the city, situated in the province of Andalusia in southern Spain, bars and eateries around town serve tapas to patrons at no cost, whenever they order a drink. With every drink comes a different tapa, often more substantial than the one before, and several rounds of drinks means a full meal can be had, -- the only cost being the couple of euros paid for every glass of wine.

""And since the food is high quality and comes in good portions,"" he added, ""these tapas are a substitute for lunch or dinner."" Granada's main attraction is undoubtedly the Alhambra, the stunning hilltop Moorish fortress that was home to the emirs who ruled the area in the 13th and 14th centuries. And while the majestic, ochre structure, a Unesco World Heritage site, is what mostly draws visitors here, there is perhaps no better way to unwind than to savor tapas gratis. Few travelers are privy to the tradition, but now, stylish newer spots like Tinta Fina, a sleek space with dark wood finishes, are bringing attention to the custom by sticking with it instead of following the latest food trends.

A few streets away, Sibarius, another newer establishment, is also adhering to convention. The bi-level contemporary boite has a menu of Spanish, Asian and Peruvian dishes, but a glass of wine, a brandy or even a sparkling water means a hearty tapa is in store. The options change often, but a recent first round, referred to as una primera, was a bowl of steak-like tuna chunks in a pool of locally produced olive oil and garnished with orange zest and whole peppercorns. One of the newest eateries to bow to this beloved culinary pastime is Filigrana Delicatessen. The airy space has been a popular hangout for locals since it opened last year, and pleasing this crowd is a top priority, said Alvaro Huertas, an energetic owner. ""Free tapas are a way of life in Granada,"" he said through an interpreter. ""It's what locals are accustomed to, and if I don't follow this way, they won't come.""

More recent eateries like Filigrana Delicatessen are reviving the enthusiasm among locals in long-established joints in town and helping to attract tourists. Opened in 1942, Bar Los Diamantes, is one such example. The classic tapas bar, operating in five locations in and near Granada, has a no frills decor; the stellar small plates of seafood are lure enough. There are about eight options, said Miguel Arias, an owner at Bar Los Diamantes, and the average bill with two or three glasses of Spanish wine is about 10 euros a person.","Few travelers are privy to a tradition of savoring free tapas, but stylish newer tapas bars are drawing attention to the custom.",02b6d6d1-338b-5537-a1aa-23a99fab57d2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/07/travel/07HEADSUP1/07HEADSUP1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=48ffc1ea887666ccfe19b55af287c9c30eed39849643ae0c6d42e45c29a6c390&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Filigrana Delicatessen is helping to revive enthusiasm among locals and attracting tourists to the tapas bar scene.,02b6d6d1-338b-5537-a1aa-23a99fab57d2,N24News/imgs/02b6d6d1-338b-5537-a1aa-23a99fab57d2.jpg,4
Music,Help Comes Hard for the Orchestra With No Home,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/arts/music/coronavirus-mahler-chamber-orchestra.html,"The violinist Michael Commandeur, a member of the Mahler Chamber Orchestra, in his Amsterdam home. The ensemble, which has members from across Europe, can't perform together during the lockdown.





Michiel Commandeur, a Dutch violinist, sounded surprisingly upbeat when he said his income had fallen to zero since the coronavirus pandemic began. He wasn't earning anything from concerts, he explained in a telephone interview from his home in Amsterdam, and, because of a loophole, he didn't qualify for support for lost income in the Netherlands, either. ""I'm counting the number of cigarettes I have,"" he said. But, Mr. Commandeur said, he was in good spirits because he was lucky compared with others. He lived in a house owned by his mother, so he didn't have to pay rent, and while his bank balance was ""going flatter and flatter,"" things were OK for now. ""Call me back in about two months and see if I'm still that optimistic about life,"" he said. Mr. Commandeur, 50, is a member of the Mahler Chamber Orchestra, a group that has plenty of acclaim, but no home concert hall or rehearsal space. Though it has an office in Berlin, the musicians only meet to go on tour, usually rehearsing when they arrive in the first city of each trip. ""We're people from about 20 different countries,"" Mr. Commandeur said. ""We have to travel from all of them to play concerts.""

Most of the Europe's orchestras and opera houses have been thrown into turmoil by the coronavirus. Even in countries where lockdowns look set to be lifted soon, concerts are unlikely to be allowed for some time. On Monday, Denmark said it would reopen schools on April 15, but that large gatherings would be banned until August. Many orchestras across the continent, like the Berlin Philharmonic or the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, receive state funding, so are in a relatively good position to deal with the crisis. But the Mahler Chamber Orchestra is different. It was formed in 1997, when members of the Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra decided they wanted to keep playing together after they reached the ensemble's age limit. The conductor Claudio Abbado took them under his wing and almost immediately secured the orchestra slots at major festivals.

In a telephone interview, Ms. Uchida said the orchestra's problem was ""its name,"" adding: ""Where the heck do they belong? If they had a name like the Berlin Chamber Orchestra, the city of Berlin might step in."" Over 90 percent of the ensemble's income comes from ticket sales, Michael Adick, the orchestra's managing director, said in a telephone interview. It will lose 2.5 million euros, or about $2.7 million, in earnings if it doesn't play before the summer, he added. (One of the orchestra's canceled engagements was an appearance at Carnegie Hall that had been scheduled for March.) The orchestra's members are now reliant on the governments of their home countries to make up their lost income. Several said in telephone interviews that what was on offer was sufficient, for now. Philipp von Steinaecker, a cellist who lives in Italy, said the government there had stopped mortgage payments for self-employed people whose income had fallen by at least a third. It was also giving some 5 million self-employed and seasonal workers 600 euros, around $650, a month. (He didn't meet the requirements or need the money, he said.) Matthew Truscott, a London-based violinist, said he had felt a wave of relief when Britain's government announced at the end of March that it would pay freelancers the equivalent of 70 percent of their average earnings over the past three years. A similar scheme was introduced last week in Spain, said Jose Vicente Castello, a French horn player who lives in Barcelona. Anna Matz, a German violinist who lives in Berlin, said she applied for a EUR5,000 grant from the city government on March 31 and received the money in her bank account within two days.

All the musicians interviewed said they were concerned about the length of the lockdown. Mr. Castello, who had been in isolation for over three weeks, said he was hopeful that things would go back to normal just as quickly as the crisis began. ""If everybody has the intention, it will come,"" he said. Others were less optimistic. Mr. Commandeur said he could not see the orchestra playing together ""before Christmas."" Mr. von Steinaecker said he couldn't even guess. Last week, he read in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that schools were unlikely to reopen until September -- but when the children return, they may have to maintain social distancing measures. ""I read that, and it made me think, 'When and how are we going to be able to have concerts?'"" Mr. von Steinaecker said. ""When will people want to sit in a room next to someone and listen to music? It's going to change the whole scene."" He might be able to work in Italy, he said, but if borders don't reopen, it will be impossible to play with the Mahler Chamber Orchestra. Even with the uncertainty over the ensemble's future, its members were still making sure to meet up. They have been checking in on one another every Saturday morning, at first using Zoom then other apps, and sharing their experiences of the crisis.

Dance,Vienna Ballet Academy Removes Leader's Power After Abuse Scandal,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/20/arts/dance/Simona-Noja-Nebyla-vienna-ballet-school.html,"LONDON -- The Vienna State Opera on Friday removed all responsibilities from Simona Noja-Nebyla, the managing director of its historic ballet academy. The move came just days after an independent commission said the academy had endangered the well-being of its students.

The academy had given its students ""insufficient medical and therapeutic care,"" the commission, which was set up by the Austrian government, said in a report issued on Tuesday. There also seemed to be ""no awareness"" that it had a responsibility for its students' health.

The decision to effectively dismiss Ms. Noja-Nebyla was announced in a news release on Friday by the company that oversees all of Austria's federal theaters.

The commission was set up in April after allegations of physical and mental abuse at the academy were revealed by Falter, an Austrian newsmagazine.",The move came days after a commission investigating abuse at the school said the academy had failed to protect students' welfare.,7d449582-3f8f-56f1-a1fd-5c5f1858b435,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/20/arts/20vienna-item/20vienna-item-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=3d0dfa681ed6da52f29a9f507e344fffcc5963fed0f319fa82feefc6c77643c7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Vienna State Opera removed all responsibilities from the managing director of its ballet academy after a commission found that students had been endangered.,7d449582-3f8f-56f1-a1fd-5c5f1858b435,N24News/imgs/7d449582-3f8f-56f1-a1fd-5c5f1858b435.jpg,6
Science,"Astronomers Discover New Likely Dwarf Planet, the Latest of Many",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/science/astronomers-discover-new-likely-dwarf-planet.html,"The neighborhood beyond Neptune is becoming ever more crowded, with astronomers announcing this week the discovery of another likely dwarf planet. A survey at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope in Hawaii has been tracking more than 600 bodies in a ring of icy debris known as the Kuiper belt. One of them turned out to be the likely dwarf planet. ""This is a big fish among a whole lot of small ones we're working with,"" said Michele Bannister, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Victoria in British Columbia who is working on the survey. In the year since NASA's New Horizons spacecraft flew past Pluto, planetary astronomers continue to make new discoveries in the Kuiper belt and what it might reveal about the earliest days of the solar system. The study of these objects also offers hints about the formation and migration of the gas giant planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

Even if the newly found world is a dwarf planet, however, it will probably be years before it might earn official designation -- part of the confusion of definitions that followed the International Astronomical Union's decision in 2006 to demote Pluto and reduce the solar system to eight planets from nine. More than 100 bodies in the solar system, all but one located along the ring of icy debris beyond Neptune, appear to meet the definition of a dwarf planet, a category that the astronomical union created to describe Pluto as well as Ceres, the largest asteroid, and Eris, a Kuiper belt object slightly smaller than Pluto. (A full-statured planet has an additional requirement: It must have ""cleared the neighborhood"" of smaller debris.)

If dwarf planets were to be reclassified as planets, as advocates for restoring Pluto to full planethood status hope to do, forget about ever trying to devise a workable mnemonic device. The new object, designated 2015 RR245, was first spotted in February as the astronomers looked through images taken five months earlier. Further observations a few weeks ago confirmed the object's 700-year loping path around the sun.

The astronomers cannot directly measure the object's size. Rather, from its brightness, how far away it is and an assumption of how reflective its surface is -- most Kuiper belt objects are roughly the darkness of coal -- they estimated the diameter to be 370 to 500 miles wide. They also cannot directly tell if 2015 RR245 is round -- the definition of a dwarf planet requires that the gravity is strong enough to pull the body into the shape of a ball. Mimas, a 250-mile-wide icy moon of Saturn, is round, and it is likely that the much larger 2015 RR245 is also round. The astronomical union has been slow to designate new dwarf planets, adding just two since 2006: Haumea and Makemake. But there is a slew of additional Kuiper belt objects larger than Mimas. If the 435-mile diameter is accurate, 2015 RR245 would rank as just the 19th largest potential dwarf planet. Larger objects include Quaoar, Orcus, Salacia and still-unnamed objects with temporary designations like ""2007 OR10"" and ""2002 MS4.""

Dr. Brown's computer keeps track of large Kuiper belt objects, and currently, 96 of them appear to be larger than Mimas and thus most likely to be round dwarf planets. Another 300 are smaller, but possibly could still be large enough to be round. Dwarf planets are ""not a rare class of objects in the outer solar system,"" Dr. Brown said. Dr. Brown and a colleague, Konstantin Batygin, further upended the field this year when they proposed the existence of a new planet, somewhere between the size of Earth and Neptune, in an orbit far beyond Pluto. They made their prediction based on the orbits of distant objects that all appeared to be aligned in roughly the same direction, nudged by the gravitational force of the unseen planet, which they are calling Planet Nine. Dr. Bannister's dwarf planet is not distant enough to be affected by Planet Nine, but at least one of the 600 objects tracked by the survey is. She declined to give details, but has described it in talks, including one attended by Dr. Brown. ""I know that it's going to fit in at least with most of the story,"" Dr. Brown said. ""It's exactly in the direction it should be for Planet Nine."" Dr. Brown said Planet Nine, if it exists, could be confirmed in two to three years. S. Alan Stern, the principal investigator of the New Horizons mission and one of Pluto's most vocal defenders, said the ninth planet was discovered long ago. ""My opinion about Planet Nine, which is Pluto, is just the same,"" he said. ""It's a planet."" He agrees with Dr. Brown's assertion that many objects as small as 2015 RR245 or smaller are almost certainly dwarf planets, and he thinks they should all be planets. Dr. Stern has even gone a step further, arguing that round moons like Earth's moon should also be counted as planets. ""There are a lot of little guys,"" he said. ""We were just wrong to think that there were just a few planets and they were all close and they were all big like Jupiter or big like the Earth.""","The object was seen in the Kuiper belt, a ring of icy debris beyond Neptune.

Media,"Eduardo del Río, Cartoonist Who Mocked Politics and Religion, Dies at 83",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/11/business/media/eduardo-del-rio-political-cartoonist-known-as-rius-dies-at-83.html,"Eduardo del Rio, a self-taught Mexican caricaturist who weaponized his pen to mock politicians, imperialism, religion, corruption, consumerism and carnivores -- getting himself kidnapped and excommunicated and also becoming immensely popular in the process -- died on Tuesday at his home in Tepoztlan, about 50 miles south of Mexico City. He was 83. His death, from complications of prostate cancer, was announced by Gov. Graco Ramirez of Morelos State. Mr. del Rio, a lapsed seminarian who adopted the pen name Rius, drew thousands of editorial cartoons. He also published humor magazines and more than 100 graphic nonfiction books. ""The only revenge we have as Mexicans,"" he often said, ""is to laugh at the powerful."" His books, many with provocative titles, included ""Marx for Beginners,"" ""The Dictionary of Human Stupidity,"" ""The True History of Uncle Sam,"" ""100 Proposals to Save What Is Left of Mexico,"" ""Hitler for Masochists,"" ""The Stomach Is First"" and ""Would Jesus Christ Have Been Catholic?""

Among his most sarcastic and successful satires were the comic books Los Supermachos, which chronicled small-town politics, and Los Agachados (The Underdogs or, literally, The Stooped Ones). He also worked for publications of various political persuasions, among them the Mexico City dailies La Jornada and El Universal. At the newspaper Ovaciones, he told The New York Times in 1979, ""I'd have to do two or three cartoons each day before the editor would accept one that was bland enough."" He lasted 14 months. Ovaciones was one of five papers that fired him. ""With the death of Rius,"" Mexico's culture secretary, Maria Cristina Garcia Cepeda, said, ""a period of political caricature and popularization has come to an end."" Mr. del Rio was an early supporter of Fidel Castro's Cuban revolution, but soured on the regime's repression and corruption. He was a card-carrying Communist for seven years until 1968, when he renounced his membership to protest the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia.

But he reserved his most splenetic rants for the political shenanigans and growing materialism he found at home. A society's degree of civilization, he said acerbically, could be measured by the numbers in four categories: cars, televisions, heart attacks and cancer patients. Eduardo Humberto del Rio Garcia was born on June 20, 1934, in Zamora, an epicenter of conservative Roman Catholicism in southwestern Mexico. Before he was six months old, he recalled, his father died after squandering what little money the family had on gambling.

His widowed mother moved with her two sons to Mexico City, where Eduardo secretly devoured comic books, consumed the classics at a secondhand bookstore and completed his secondary school education at a seminary run by the Salesian order. He worked as a messenger and a cashier, sold soap and finally landed a job answering phones in a funeral home, where he had plenty of time to practice his drawing. (His older brother was a commercial artist.) He was recruited by Ja Ja, a humor magazine, after his doodles were noticed by a mourner who was familiar with the magazine's editor. A self-described Marxist-masochist, Mr. del Rio founded the Mexican Workers Party's magazine Popular Insurgency. He Latinized his surname to Rius, he said, in case his family considered his irreverent cartoons too incendiary. Indeed, his work was so caustic that it caused him to be kidnapped. Grabbed by the police in 1969, he was turned over to soldiers, who, he later told The Times, ""took me up a mountain and stood me next to an open grave.""

He continued: "" 'We're going to kill you now,' they said. 'You're an enemy of Mexico.' "" He said he was freed only after the soldiers learned that he was related to a former Mexican president. Years later, the publication of his book ""The Manual of the Perfect Atheist,"" in 1980, got him excommunicated from the church, he said, because it not only challenged God's existence but also suggested, as one chapter title put it, ""the exploitation of Christ by man."" ""I have to thank God, who made me an atheist and the Catholic Church, which made me anticlerical,"" he told La Jornada. His ""Marx for Beginners"" was praised by the political scientist Andrew Hacker in The Times Book Review as ""a superb little book"" peppered with ""beguiling illustrations."" His latest book, ""Los Presidentes Dan Pena"" (""The Pitiful Presidents""), published this year, is another barbed history lesson about Mexico, which he once said was submerged in the ""ignominy of pedagogical mediocrity"" -- despite his relentless efforts to enlighten his fellow Mexicans. As the author Carlos Monsivais once said, there were three major departments of education in Mexico: the Ministry of Public Education, the multimedia conglomerate Televisa, and Rius. Mr. Del Rio's survivors include his wife, Micaela Flores, and his daughter, Citlali del Rio Flores. While Mr. del Rio was a militant humorist (and a vegetarian), he was also considered a public intellectual. He said that his messages penetrated more deeply because they were both visual and jocular. ""The great philosophers are very serious,"" he said. ""Sometimes it is hard to understand everything they say. Humor, on the other hand, is what makes people laugh, and that gives a lot of envy to philosophers, similar to what happens with painters toward caricaturists.""",Not even being kidnapped and excommunicated were enough to stop a prolific caricaturist who wielded a mighty pen against Mexico's establishment.,c36f0a40-a2bc-5b9a-bfd9-68d549502e4b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/14/arts/12delrio-obit-2/12delrio-obit-2-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=63d9a3c8717a7f908ab9c43f336b4a73f9af80de46932e47924775f198305d51&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Eduardo del Río in 2010.,c36f0a40-a2bc-5b9a-bfd9-68d549502e4b,N24News/imgs/c36f0a40-a2bc-5b9a-bfd9-68d549502e4b.jpg,16
Music,"Review: 'Anatomy Theater,' an Opera, Puts Convicts Under the Knife",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/08/arts/music/anatomy-theater-review.html,"Evil people were once believed to be fundamentally different from the good, right down to the makeup of their bodies. Anatomists held public dissections to expose the telltale traits of moral corruption in the internal organs of criminals and convicts.

From this pernicious strand of medical history, the composer David Lang and the scenic designer Mark Dion have created a gruesome, strangely entertaining chamber opera, ""Anatomy Theater,"" which had its New York premiere on Saturday at BRIC House in Brooklyn, the second offering of this year's Prototype festival of new music theater.

This 75-minute work, which includes long stretches of spoken text (Mr. Lang and Mr. Dion wrote the chilling libretto), as well as videos (by Bill Morrison) and projections (by Laurie Olinder), fits in with the mission of Prototype to foster the future of contemporary opera by opening the genre to fresh thinking and experimentation.

Real Estate,Where St. Vincent's Once Stood,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/realestate/where-st-vincents-once-stood.html,"The developers of a 200-unit condominium complex on the site of the former St. Vincent's Hospital campus, which to its opponents was a symbol of the overdevelopment of New York during the Bloomberg era, hope to leave its contentious past behind. Intended to have the feel of a neighborhood within a neighborhood, the Greenwich Lane, a project developed by the Rudin Management Company and Global Holdings, will take up half the block between West 11th and West 12th Streets, Seventh Avenue and Avenue of the Americas. Sales for the project -- which will be made up of five adjoining apartment buildings of varying heights, styles and sizes, with shared open space in their backyards -- are expected to begin this week. Many of the units will be large enough to accommodate growing families, but there is no mistaking that this will be a luxury development. Prices at the $1 billion project will average $3,500 a square foot -- among the highest for new condos downtown and well above average for developments in the city. Move-ins are expected in the summer of 2015. ""It's an exhilarating new chapter, because the speculation about what it is, is over,"" said James Lansill, a senior managing director of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which is handling sales.

""It feels terrific to show it off to the marketplace,"" he added, ""because simultaneous to any controversy that was happening, there's been a tremendous buildup of interest in the project."" Like many of the four-story row houses in the area, the Greenwich Lane will contain at least some red brick in all of its facades, using some preserved hospital walls as well as new construction that plays off the past. Despite these efforts to blend in, the complex does contain sections that will tower over most apartments on surrounding blocks. But as the development team is quick to point out, the project will have less square footage than the hospital did, and some heights, like those on West 11th, will be lower than before. But for the neighborhood advocates who protested long and hard against the project, time doesn't seem to have healed all wounds.

Made up mostly of two-bedroom units, the Greenwich Lane is also offering five town houses, which will have their own addresses as well as elevators, terraces and wood-fired pizza ovens. ""There are many different, unique opportunities here,"" Bill Rudin, chief executive of the company, said on a recent afternoon inside the project's sales office on the Avenue of the Americas. By him stood his two children, Michael and Samantha, who are among several Rudins who worked on the Greenwich Lane. One of New York's most established real estate families, the Rudins oversee an expansive portfolio of residential and commercial space. But this project will be their first new-construction apartment complex since the 1970s. ""There is really something for everyone,"" Samantha Rudin, a vice president of the firm, said of the apartment mix. Still, only a select few may be able to walk away with a home. Even the most affordable unit won't come cheap: a one-bedroom at 155 West 11th Street, the largest of the Greenwich Lane's 5 main buildings, with 83 units, will be listed at $2.05 million. Rising 17 stories along Seventh Avenue, No. 155 will also very likely be the most prominent. Stores will ring its base, while its second and third stories could be leased for medical offices, according to Corcoran Sunshine. Eager to give each unit a distinctive imprint, the development team is offering 130 floor plans. Also, the designer Thomas O'Brien of Aero Studios, in his first ground-up project, has taken something of a mix-and-match approach with interiors. For instance, kitchen cabinets will be painted white in some units and stained in others; and on bathroom floors, nine varieties of stone will be installed, some as slabs, others mosaics. The project will also employ more than 100 different styles of light fixture, all of which Mr. O'Brien designed.

At the heart of the project will be a long garden, lined with birch trees and bluestone benches. A 25-meter-long swimming pool, a golf simulator and an 89-space residents-only parking garage, which can be reached from the basements of several buildings, are also to be included. ""There is a lot of value here,"" Mr. Lansill said. ""No one could replicate this."" In a sense, though, many developers might not want to. For one thing, many in the neighborhood were left seething by the closing of the hospital in 2010, and they continue to worry about the fact that there is now no hospital at all on the West Side from the tip of Manhattan to Midtown. But some doctors will be coming back. Next June, across Seventh Avenue from the Greenwich Lane, a medical center will open in a former St. Vincent's property known as the O'Toole Building, whose 1963 white facade was recently restored.

Likely to be called the Lenox Hill Center for Comprehensive Care, it will offer a round-the-clock emergency room and provide 90 percent of the services that St. Vincent's offered, Mr. Rudin said, though it will not accommodate inpatients. Although some neighbors have blamed the Rudins for the loss of their hospital, Mr. Rudin pointed out that back in 2007, he provided $55 million to help bail it out, in a loan secured with a St. Vincent's building at 130 West 12th. After St. Vincent's went bankrupt three years later, the Rudins took control of No. 130 and converted it to a 42-unit condo. In 2011 they bought the hospital complex in bankruptcy court for $260 million.

""Nobody fought harder than we did for a full-scale hospital,"" Mr. Rudin said. Besides, Mr. Rudin said in his defense, his firm donated the O'Toole Building and the land it sits on -- a $50 million gift, he said, based on current values -- while chipping in $10 million of the $125 million to create a medical center there. Mr. Rudin also said his project would benefit the area in other ways. A triangular park that St. Vincent's owned on Seventh Avenue will be deeded to the city; he said he had also helped orchestrate the city's purchase of a site for a new public elementary school on Avenue of the Americas at 17th Street. In addition, the Rudin firm has contributed $1 million for a local arts program and another $1 million to a nonprofit group that advocates for affordable housing, though the Greenwich Lane itself will have no below-market-rate units. ""There are so many things you can do,"" Mr. Rudin said, ""and these are very, very substantial."" Even so, some opponents are not ready to forgive and forget just yet. Some parents are worried that the complex will strain already-crowded schools in the area, like Public School 41, on West 11th. Ann Kjellberg, whose daughter attended that school, said luxury development had already changed life for the worse in her area, pointing to a longtime nursing home on West 12th that recently went condo. ""I don't so much blame the developers,"" Ms. Kjellberg said, ""but the municipal environment that allows them unfettered access to the city, with so little support for anyone else."" At first the project also came under fire for its size and look. The Landmarks Preservation Commission and other city agencies ultimately scaled it down from the 450 units originally planned, and forced Rudin to retain the facades of some historic red-brick hospital buildings. Those narrow facades now stand like stage sets around the construction site, though they will eventually be incorporated into the project.

Those moves may have been important, said Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, an advocacy group that for years led a fight against the Greenwich Lane, but the Village's character will still be hurt. ""This project will make the neighborhood more wealthy, more homogeneous,"" he said. ""In terms of the positive results for the community, it's really hard to see what they are.""","A look at the transformation of the St. Vincent's Hospital site in the West Village, a mega-work-in-progress.",2d8d4059-9039-5066-b87d-b823d8862307,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/27/realestate/27COV_GREENWICHSPAN/27COV_GREENWICHSPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=225359759b0716442b9ba212d13b41df193b0974f4f3968f15c25ce11e8d90a5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"A 200-unit complex, the Greenwich Lane, is being built on the site of the former St. Vincent's Hospital campus.",2d8d4059-9039-5066-b87d-b823d8862307,N24News/imgs/2d8d4059-9039-5066-b87d-b823d8862307.jpg,7
Science,"Stick Insects Are Easy Bird Food, and That Might Help Them Reproduce",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/science/stick-insects-eggs-birds.html,"Stick Insects Are Easy Bird Food, and That Might Help Them Reproduce 
* None 

New research suggests that when the stick insect  is eaten its eggs can be dispersed far and wide. It's obvious why a stick insect's wardrobe is the way it is. Look like a stick, avoid getting eaten. But scientists in Japan noticed that despite their camouflage, stick insects became bird food quite frequently. And they also wondered: why do their eggs look like seeds? In a paper published last week in the journal Ecology, the team of researchers suggest that these mostly flightless insects could sometimes benefit when they are eaten, using birds as carriers to disperse their eggs miles away, just like seeds. This passive dispersal mechanism could be why stick insects are found in places far from their original homes. ""It's commonly assumed that when insects are eaten by birds, they and their unborn young have no chance of survival,"" said Kenji Suetsugu, the leader of the study, a biologist who studies parasitic plants at Kobe University. But their results potentially overturn this dogma, he added. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook.| Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Because plants can't move around on their own, one way they disperse their seeds is by creating seed-containing fruits that animals eat. Thus, as animals travel, relieving themselves along the way, the plants travel too -- through their seeds. But many birds also eat insects. So the researchers reasoned, that just like the fruits, the insects could be a means for dispersal, as long as their eggs can pass through the birds unharmed. One thing that makes stick insect eggs different from most other insects is that they resemble seeds -- same shape, size, color and texture. And they're coated in a chemical layer of calcium oxalate, the stuff humans find in kidney stones. As you might imagine, it doesn't dissolve easily. Some of these eggs, carried inside females in certain stick insect species, also don't need to be fertilized to hatch into viable offspring. A close-up of stick insect eggs that have passed through birds' digestive tracts. An earlier hypothesis is that the thickness and shape of stick insect eggs protects them from parasitic wasps. But the researchers also wondered whether these hard-shell, every-ready eggs survive a bird's digestive tract. In 2015, Dr. Suetsugu and his team mixed dozens of these eggs into bird food and fed it to brown-eared bulbuls, birds that eat stick insects in Japan. Within three hours they were scavenging through bird excrement, looking for intact bug eggs under a microscope. A small percentage of the eggs from three species of stick insects made it through intact. But two years later, none had hatched. It's possible that the temperature and chemical environment inside the digestive tract ""might have annihilated them, in spite of a lack of mechanical damages,"" they wrote. However, they repeated the experiment in 2017, with 70 eggs from a single species. Twenty percent made it through, and two of those hatched, proving that it was possible for birds that consumed stick insects to drop their eggs like seeds to new locations. Perhaps not coincidentally, the insects' egg production season overlaps with the birds' migration season. But even with flocks adding up to hundreds of birds eating stick insects and excreting their eggs, dispersal would be a rare occurrence, given that stick insects don't carry many fully developed eggs inside them, and so few make it through the brown-eared bulbul's digestive tract intact and viable. They now want to determine whether stick insects share similar genes in different locations along the birds' migration flight paths.

More than three decades later, he is still doing exactly that. The causes, however, have changed. Fiercely dedicated to fighting the AIDS epidemic then, Mr. Moffett is battling climate change now. ""The activisms of both rely on science as ally and protagonist in the struggle,"" Mr. Moffett wrote in an email after a recent interview at his studio in Staten Island . ""And both activisms faced or face a similar political resistance of knuckleheads as the prime antagonists."" Mr. Moffett, 64 , has never been shy about letting you know who he thinks those knuckleheads are. What may be his most famous creation, the 1987 lithograph ""He Kills Me,"" features an orange-and-black target symbol next to a black-and-white photograph of a simpering Ronald Reagan; the title words are emblazoned in orange capitals beneath the president's face. Marching AIDS activists used to carry posters of the piece, which is now in the collections of five major museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Today, a large sticker that he designed, which Mr. Moffett calls a ""naughty little work,"" is on his studio wall. Equally searing, it has a blue background and huge white capital letters that read, ""Break His Little Twitter Finger."" Mr. Moffett, who had the piece pasted around New York, signed it with the words ""Unhinged Homos,"" referring to gay men, like him, who object to President Trump's policies. ""It's a little meanspirited,"" he said with a chuckle.

Neither work, however, looks remotely like the art Mr. Moffett has destined for his new show, ""ILL (nature paintings),"" which will open on Nov. 7 at the Marianne Boesky Gallery in Chelsea. Abstract, sculptural and sometimes huge, these paintings -- and the artist insists on that term -- began as digital designs. They were then cut out of one or more layers of wood, covered with paint and coated with a resin that is sometimes so glossy that the results appear almost succulent. Incorporating holes and curves and occasionally edged with tiny spikes, the shapes can evoke anything from Hindu symbols to paramecia. But they carry as much of a message as any of his other art.

""The language within the gallery is a special language,"" said Mr. Moffett, who lives in Manhattan with his longtime partner, the artist Robert Gober . ""It can involve irony in a serious way -- and humor -- but still make significant points."" When he created posters of ""He Kills Me,"" which he initially pasted to New York buildings in the middle of the night, he was making art that shouted. This is also true of ""Think Science,"" a billboard in Lexington, Ky., that he created last year for the organization For Freedoms, whose 50 State Initiative enlisted artists nationwide to make public works encouraging civic engagement. ""There's a much subtler didactic undercurrent to this work in the gallery than to something on the street,"" he said. His latest art is more inclined to whisper, though it can whisper insistently.

Consider "" Lot 082519 (cocoa brain), "" part of the new show. (The lot number, part of his cataloging system, refers to the date he started working on a piece.) This four-part chocolate-colored work, about eight feet tall, is based on a photograph of a cross-section of the human brain. You could say that it is a charitable representation of what Mr. Moffett thinks fills the minds of climate-change skeptics. It's about ""the stupidity of half the conversation around the climate crisis,"" he said. ""'Cocoa brain' somehow describes that. It is the idiocy, lunacy, tragedy of the climate-crisis deniers.""

Of course, people looking at the work may not immediately think that it concerns global warming. Or that the shiny green tentacled piece "" Lot 072419 (the new pippin)"" refers to Pippin apples and the way contemporary food is processed and engineered. Or that "" Lot 091819 (the pentagonal oak) ,"" which was inspired by an 1883 specimen of oak leaves that Mr. Moffett found in the botany collection at the Staten Island Museum, reflects the decline of species. But the titles of the show and of the individual works provide clues. ""The title is really important,"" said Mr. Moffett, a San Antonio native whose work reflects his dual university degrees in biology and art . Naming his pieces, he said, ""brings language to these abstract forms,"" and the words and the art ""find each other somewhere in the middle."" Marianne Boesky , whose gallery has represented Mr. Moffett for nearly 20 years, said that he could communicate ""very layered messages,"" but that it was up to viewers to discover them. Or, she added, you can look at the pieces, which sell individually for about $40,000 to as much as $250,000 or $300,000, ""and just revel in how beautifully they're made.""

""Painting is what people have said is dead every decade, but Donald can make it so fresh and exciting,"" Ms. Boesky said. She added that she hoped the show's visitors would investigate its meanings: ""If you lift the hood a little, there's a lot to talk about."" That includes subjects other than the environment. With its perforations and sweeping curves, the art also alludes to gun violence and sexuality, other topics Mr. Moffett has explored. But even though he said he expected scientific progress to prevail in the climate crisis, as it had with AIDS, he said the threats to nature would continue to be the most important theme for his art. ""The dilemmas that we face and the problems that we face in relationship to the natural world call for, I would suggest, all of our attention,"" Mr. Moffett said, ""but certainly the attention of an artist who brings as much from our world into the studio as I take out of the studio into the world.""","At a gallery in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York, this painter takes on a new set of ""knuckleheads.""",d76c3057-c8f7-599e-9256-ceb829adeefb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/multimedia/27sp-moffett1/27sp-moffett1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=7d3051a673f3e5b71350adf0dfef05b43d98758809be74f9ee83f3eb136de89f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Donald Moffett in his studio standing next to ""Lot 062619 (cell division, red)"" and in front of ""Lot 072619 (the new damson)"" ahead of his show ""ILL (nature paintings)"" at the Marianne Boesky Gallery in Chelsea.",d76c3057-c8f7-599e-9256-ceb829adeefb,N24News/imgs/d76c3057-c8f7-599e-9256-ceb829adeefb.jpg,14
Travel,Five Places to Visit in Stockholm with a Local Craft Brewer,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/20/travel/five-places-to-visit-in-stockholm.html,"There's more to the Swedish capital than its good looks. For proof, look south to Sodermalm, a large inner-city island humming with creativity. ""There are more fun and innovative and exciting and heartfelt things going on in Sodermalm than anywhere else in Stockholm,"" said the craft brewer Henok Fentie, a Stockholm native and co-founder of Omnipollo, an experimental, and highly influential, Swedish beer producer.

Although he's currently living in Ethiopia -- a temporary posting with his diplomat wife -- whenever Mr. Fentie's in town, you'll likely find him on the island where he grew up, which was also the natural location to open the first Omnipollo outpost in 2015, a trippy pizza-and-beer bar called Omnipollos Hatt. Today there are three more bars -- in Gothenburg, Hamburg, and a seasonal beer garden in central Stockholm -- but the fondness for Soder, as locals call it, endures. ""It's absolutely special,"" he said, before sharing his top picks on Sodermalm. ""Cocktails are really dependent on who's making them rather than where they're made in Stockholm,"" Mr. Fentie said, and for quality, the name to know is Josephine Sondlo, an award-winning bartender. ""She's extremely knowledgeable, and she makes the most fantastic cocktails."" These days, find her mixing drinks at Bio Rio, a single-screen art-house cinema from the 1940s that opened a revamped bar and bistro in September.

This corner bistro and furniture producer in one is also Mr. Fentie's favorite spot for dinner. ""They're very innovative, and they do a different themed menu each and every time I've been there,"" he said. The creative menus change every couple of months -- recent themes have been Mexico, cinema and the 1970s -- and the bright, bustling dining room can feel ""almost like a second home.""

A curated mix of Scandinavian and international brands is the draw at this men's and women's wear store hidden inside the Bruno shopping gallery, a small and fashionable retail complex. ""It's one of those places that you walk in and you walk out with a completely different outfit from top to toe,"" he said of the comprehensive offerings from labels such as Eytys, Ganni, L:a Bruket, Chimi and ADNYM.

""Every time I'm back and I go for coffee, I'll go to Drop Coffee,"" he said of this coffee shop and roastery that has distinguished itself with its light, Nordic-style roasts and attentive baristas. His go-to order is a no-frills black drip coffee, but curious connoisseurs can also sample single-origin pour-overs and personalized tasting flights.","Henok Fentie, the Swedish craft brewer who runs one of the coolest bars in the city, shares his top spots in Sodermalm, the buzzy enclave where he grew up.",f27205b4-1e91-5ee9-8069-a50263c938b6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/20/travel/20Stockholm-5Places5/20Stockholm-5Places5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=3330df8ccb2a797711f19050ae6e7bbfce960c2ba09eec6daae8e6482bab1e34&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Stockholm craft brewer, Henok Fentie, is a fan of Bio Rio, an art-house cinema that opened a revamped bar and bistro in September.",f27205b4-1e91-5ee9-8069-a50263c938b6,N24News/imgs/f27205b4-1e91-5ee9-8069-a50263c938b6.jpg,4
Television,"The Best Movies and TV Shows New to Netflix, Amazon and More in April",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/arts/television/best-tv-movies-netflix-amazon-hulu-hbo-april.html,"Watching is The New York Times's TV and film recommendation website. Sign up for our twice-weekly newsletter here. April is the cruelest month, save for when it comes to streaming selections. (And as an April bonus, we have an extra recommendation for you: Jordan Peele's reboot of ""The Twilight Zone"" on CBS All Access. The first two episodes will be available April 1.) Below are the most interesting of what we've found among the new TV series and movies coming to the major streaming services this month, plus a roundup of all the best new titles in all genres. (Streaming services occasionally change schedules without giving notice.) When we last left Sabrina, she signed her name in the Book of the Beast. Now what? As we enter Season 2 -- or Part 2, as Netflix likes to call it; or Phase 2, as the Dark Lord himself might dub his diabolic plan for our favorite teenage witch -- Sabrina is starting to raise a little hell. Her devotion to the Dark Lord and her aptitude for magic itself are both put to the test when she confronts the inherent misogyny of the witch world. (Why is everything tipped in favor of the warlocks?) There are some clever horror in-jokes this season, and some spot-on guest stars familiar to the genre (Veronica Cartwright, Ray Wise). So tune in for more ominous intrigue, sexy interludes with the studly Nick Scratch and some facetime with Satan himself. Let the half-breed ascend!

There is something beautifully soothing -- and tragic, too -- about the remarkable imagery on display in this globe-spanning wildlife series, which captures rare animals in their remote habitats. Thousands of pink flamingos, for example, take over a newly formed lake in an African salt pan after a torrential rain, a place where they can breed safely, away from predators. It's a delight to see the flamingo chicks learning to walk out of there -- until the focus shifts to the one that can't keep up because the salt has solidified around its tiny limbs like crusty leg warmers. The narrator David Attenborough's voice is warmly reassuring, even when telling us that wildlife populations are in decline. ""For the first time in human history,"" he says, ""the stability of nature can no longer be taken for granted."" Here's a chance to see it while you can.

This sweet, funny movie raises an unavoidable question for the writer-director Jennifer Kaytin Robinson: Why would present-day New York music journalist Jenny (Gina Rodriguez) want to move to San Francisco to work for Rolling Stone, when Rolling Stone hasn't been headquartered in San Francisco for more than 40 years? If you can set that aside, the rest of Jenny's story might draw you in. The move to the West Coast brings a breakup with her boyfriend Nate (Lakeith Stanfield), and a heartbroken Jenny and her two BFFs (DeWanda Wise, Brittany Snow) decide to commiserate by spending the day (and night) playing hooky, getting high, and generally not acting their age. This is a celebration of female friendship and a bittersweet contemplation of receding youth, as Jenny is compelled to say goodbye to New York, goodbye to her twenties and of course, goodbye to Nate, with his limpid, soulful eyes. Two grieving parents (Uma Thurman, Tony Goldwyn) track down the teenage girl who was the recipient of their deceased daughter's heart and begin generously giving her more things -- fine clothes, a car, a full scholarship to a pricey private school. But the girl, Sasha (actress Sivan Alyra Rose), is a little weirded out by the parents' unsolicited beneficence. And as she becomes further enmeshed in the life her young donor left behind, strange things begin happening. She becomes ambidextrous. She hears The Stone Roses playing when the radio's not on. She has sudden violent impulses. Set against a Southwestern landscape, this horror series is disturbing, addictive and moody.

Last season's nemesis, The Terror, has been rooted out and our unlikely blue do-gooder The Tick is back for another round of hyper-stylized superhero satire. This time he's tackling government lies, human trafficking and other things of a murder-y nature. The Tick is so busy that his sidekick, Arthur, however, is having serious trouble keeping up. Arthur has poor danger reflexes, secret identity issues and a new nemesis called Lobstercules. There are also other heroes on hand (for team-ups) and several new villains. Haven't seen Season 1, you say? No problem -- this second outing is super easy to follow. Also arriving: ""The Addams Family"" (April 1), ""Beetlejuice"" (April 1), ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure"" (April 1), ""Blade"" (April 1), ""Chinatown"" (April 1), ""Days of Thunder"" (April 1), ""Everything Must Go"" (April 1), ""In a World ...

The new season of Wyatt Cenac's docu-series focuses on the American education system and why it seems so broken. (And with the recent admissions scandals, he drolly notes, even bribing your child's way into an education appears to be broken, too.) Cenac talks to students, educators, historians and others about issues like school unionization, the undervaluing of teachers and the school-to-prison pipeline. The series isn't all hard slogging, though; Cenac also explores things like goat yoga classes, which can only be called amusing.

Richard Wright's celebrated 1940 novel receives its third screen adaptation by the artist and first-time director Rashid Johnson. Wright's story has been updated (by the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Suzan-Lori Parks), but his protagonist Bigger Thomas (Ashton Sanders, so good in ""Moonlight""), is still a young black man trapped in a world rigged against him. Bigger rejects the gangster lifestyle offered by a friend and thinks he's found a way out of poverty in the South Side of Chicago when he gets a job as a driver for a wealthy businessman, Henry Dalton (Bill Camp). But his dreams of self-improvement are doomed by his interactions with Dalton's ""woke"" daughter Mary (Margaret Qualley), who is enamored by what she thinks Bigger represents. The movie isn't a masterpiece, but it has much to admire: striking visual compositions, Sanders's nuanced performance and a tense atmosphere which suggests much more than is said here. Some say Westeros will end in fire, some say in ice. One thing is for sure: ""Game of Thrones"" is ending this year. Yes, very, very sadly, our time with the secret prince, the dragon queen, the fiery witch, the tree-wizard and countless other characters is coming to a close (like the lives of so many other characters we've long missed). Will the living triumph over the army of the dead? Or will the Night King kill them all, and leave the world an icy hell? Oh, we (sob) can't go on ...

[Rewatch ""Game of Thrones"" with us. Sign up to get our guides to the first seven seasons straight to your inbox.] It's 1832 in Halifax, West Yorkshire, England, and Anne Lister is determined to do whatever she very well pleases with her life. Driving a stagecoach, for example, or mercy-killing a horse -- or dressing in masculine clothing and sleeping with women. Possibly even marrying one! Lister, a real-life historical figure, is widely considered to be the first modern lesbian, and this Anglo-American series, created by Sally Wainwright (""Happy Valley"") is miles away from the standard stuffy period drama, focusing, as it does, on the ways that its protagonist disrupted the conventions of her time. As played by Suranne Jones, Lister is charming and brilliant, dazzling others even when she's not in the room, much to the consternation of her overlooked sister (Gemma Whelan). Scandalously good fun, this show.

Ramy Hassan is going to die alone. Well, that's what everybody keeps telling him. Ramy's mother wants him to try picking up women at their local mosque in New Jersey, while one of his friends informs him that he's running out of options (""There are only two hot Muslim girls left in town""). So naturally, Ramy is dating a Jewish woman. Ramy Youssef, the show's star and creator, loosely based this half-hour comedy series on his own experiences as a first-generation Egyptian-American, and the humor comes from a very specific place. Balancing a spiritual life with a love life is both a serious issue and, as it turns out, a very funny one.

Movies,Oscars Rewind: When Harvey Weinstein Was a Force in Oscar Campaigns,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/movies/oscars-harvey-weinstein.html,"When Harrison Ford went onstage to present best picture at the 1999 Oscars, it seemed obvious that he would be handing the statuette to his old ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" pal Steven Spielberg for the World War II drama ""Saving Private Ryan."" After Ford opened the envelope, the director John Madden recalled, ""in my head, he seemed to take an extraordinary amount of time to absorb what he was reading."" Then Ford announced Madden's film, ""Shakespeare in Love,"" and ""it was completely surreal."" Nobody could have predicted that outcome eight months earlier, when ""Ryan"" opened to rapturous reviews and terrific box-office returns. (It ultimately earned more than $485 million worldwide.) ""Should we just FedEx the Oscars over to Spielberg's house now and save everybody the trouble of voting?"" one academy member was quoted as saying in Variety. Harvey Weinstein had other ideas. The Miramax mogul had established himself as a master Oscar campaigner, having shepherded such disparate films as ""My Left Foot,"" ""The English Patient"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" to wins in major categories in previous years. Now, through sheer force of will, it seemed, he wanted to pull off one of the biggest upsets in Academy Awards history. ""He's a man of extraordinary passion and determination, whether anybody likes it or not,"" Madden said of Weinstein, who now faces five charges including rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault. Weinstein has denied the accusations. ""He was obviously a force of nature within the industry, and in other ways we hadn't understood and are appalled to look back on.""

In mid-December 1998 -- the 11th hour in Oscar season -- Weinstein decided he would throw his then-considerable clout behind ""Shakespeare"" for best picture. The film had a long and troubled path to the screen, with Daniel Day-Lewis and Julia Roberts slated nearly a decade earlier to play the titular playwright and his romantic muse, and Edward Zwick (""Glory"") set to direct. That plan fell apart, and Kenneth Branagh and Winona Ryder stepped into the main roles. Finally, Madden (who had directed the 1997 Victorian drama ""Mrs. Brown"" for Miramax) came on board, with Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow as his stars. In the editing room, Madden and Weinstein clashed over the film's tone and ending. The studio executive ""wanted it to end like a romantic comedy -- in other words, the boy gets the girl,"" Madden said, adding that the prizewinning playwright who co-wrote the screenplay, ""Tom Stoppard, and I pointed out, 'Well, that didn't happen.'"" Madden prevailed, and critics and audiences embraced the film even as the Bard and his beloved Viola went their separate ways. Weinstein's team lobbied journalists and voters to convince them of the merits of ""Shakespeare"" -- and the shortcomings of its main competitor. ""'Private Ryan' was hit with one of the first whisper campaigns, when a rumor is spread to manipulate viewers into thinking something negative,"" Sasha Stone, founder and editor of awardsdaily.com, said in a recent email. The spin? That the movie peaks in its opening sequence, a harrowing recreation of the D-Day invasion, and goes downhill from there. ""Everyone knew that Weinstein played dirty,"" Stone added. ""Subtle but dirty.""

The voters' hearts were with ""Shakespeare"" -- especially since the largest bloc in the academy is actors, and ""they love movies about themselves,"" Stone said. As Madden noted, ""the movie is a love letter to the theater and acting."" In fact, ""Shakespeare"" had won the Screen Actors Guild Award for best ensemble. ""That should have telegraphed it to Oscar watchers more than it did,"" the Turner Classic Movies host Dave Karger said in a telephone interview.

Miramax and DreamWorks, the studio behind ""Private Ryan,"" both spent millions on ""for your consideration"" ads, yet the race became seen as a David-and-Goliath battle, with Spielberg and company as the giant. ""It always seemed like a hilarious juxtaposition -- two movies more unalike are hard to imagine,"" Madden said. ""That's why the Oscars are so fascinating."" (Spielberg ended up winning best director; ""I never imagined for a second he wouldn't,"" said Madden, who was also nominated.) When ""Shakespeare"" was named best picture, Weinstein took the stage along with four other credited producers, including Zwick, who had remained nominally attached to the project. ""Their contributions to the film as producers were hard to define,"" Madden said. ""Harvey was not a producer when we were making the film"" but gave himself the title later.

Through a spokesman, Weinstein took issue with that characterization of his role. He developed the script, cast Paltrow, Fiennes and other performers, and hired Madden, according to his representative, Juda Engelmayer. As for his campaigning tactics, Weinstein refused to apologize at the time. ""I believe in supporting films,"" he said then, adding, ""I think you should get in trouble in this town for not supporting films."" Rules were soon changed limiting the nature and number of producers eligible to receive Oscars. ""It's unbecoming for studio heads to insert themselves into that space, and a rampant ego produced that circumstance,"" Madden said. ""But success has many parents and failure is an orphan, as we know."" Not everyone bought his justification. ""Your campaigns are obnoxious, and they do create the appearance of influence-buying,"" the critic Jack Mathews wrote in a post-Oscars open letter to Weinstein in The New York Daily News. He added, ""What should be remembered as a great night for 'Shakespeare' is being remembered as an ugly fight over a gold-plated geegaw."" Madden, for one, has fonder memories. ""Though I've made many films since that I've felt equally proud of, 'Shakespeare' stands out because of the extraordinary arc of its journey,"" said the director, whose more recent credits include the hit ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" and its sequel. ""I'm perfectly happy to go down with that title next to my name.""","He pulled off an upset when ""Shakespeare in Love"" won best picture 20 years ago, though in retrospect he may not have been the underdog he seemed at the time.",b4ead9cb-0af0-52e9-9763-b303d2b8511a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/16/arts/16oscar-1999-1/16oscars-1999-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=280ec9da5ee88f3d028912b140c24824eca3bad6ec302ee70310efd6f37abd32&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Weinstein with his prize.

Media,"John Fairchild, Who Made Women's Wear Daily a Must-Read, Dies at 87",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/28/business/media/john-fairchild-editor-of-womens-wear-daily-dies-at-87.html,"John Fairchild, the witty and irascible publisher and editor who transformed his family's fusty trade publication, Women's Wear Daily, into the lively bible of the fashion industry, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 87. Women's Wear Daily announced his death without specifying the cause. For more than three decades, from 1960 to 1997, Mr. Fairchild was one of the most powerful, and mercurial, people in the fashion business. From his perch atop Women's Wear Daily -- and later at W magazine, which he founded -- he helped make kings out of designers like Oscar de la Renta, Yves Saint Laurent and Bill Blass and whacked down those who did not meet his exacting standards. And before Gawker and Spy magazine and Page Six in The New York Post became must-reads, Mr. Fairchild was already encamped at the intersection of fashion, celebrity and high society, turning socialites like C. Z. Guest, Mercedes Bass and Pat Buckley into personalities, stationing photographers outside fancy restaurants as they came and went. Everyone who crossed his path knew to beware of the newspaper's saucy headlines and withering asides in capital letters. He even gave designer collections letter grades, as if Carolina Herrera and Donna Karan were back in high school.

""Everybody got graded,"" Ms. Herrera said on Friday. Calvin Klein, another loyal subscriber, said, ""He made WWD into a paper that the media as well as socials and celebrities and everyone else read to find out what was going on."" Not that Mr. Fairchild liked to take credit for mussing the industry's hair and bruising feelings. ""On the whole, I think the fashion press's power -- and WWD's in particular -- is greatly overrated,"" he wrote in his 1989 memoir, ""Chic Savages."" ""We don't make or break a designer. Any designer who is good gets ahead. We write what the buyers are saying."" John Burr Fairchild was born in Newark on March 6, 1927, and grew up in Glen Ridge, N.J. His paternal grandfather, E. W. Fairchild, the son of a Dutch Reform minister, had begun WWD in 1910 to cover the garment business. Meticulous to a fault, it was also famously dull. From E. W., the family business, which includes other, smaller trade publications, passed on to John's father, Louis. As a teenager in the 1940s, John went to Kent, the Connecticut boarding school, and spent his vacations working in the family's Manhattan offices as an errand boy. He went to Princeton University, married Jill Lipsky, worked briefly in retail and then moved to WWD, taking over the Paris bureau in 1955.

There he made enemies by doing things like calling the designers Cristobal Balenciaga and Hubert de Givenchy the ""Dullsville Boys"" in print and branding their collections ""Flop art."" At one point he was banned from Balenciaga's shows. Undeterred, he hired a photographer to shoot a show with a Telephoto lens from a rooftop across the street. The view was perfect, until one of Balenciaga's minions closed the blinds.

Mr. Fairchild returned to New York in 1960, took over as WWD's publisher and set about making changes. ""Fashion is a bunch of blah blah,"" he liked to say. What interested him were personalities, so he replaced the coverage of hemlines and fabrics with society photos and gossip. ""The business he inherited was very dull, and he turned it all around,"" said Patrick McCarthy, Mr. Fairchild's successor at both WWD and W, which was later sold to Conde Nast. ""He realized that printing cotton prices every day and which buyer was coming from Detroit to New York was not the publication he wanted to run. He was interested in the glamour and the fun and the bitchiness."" Mr. Fairchild, as he was referred to by everyone in the newsroom -- ""There was no calling him John,"" the writer William Norwich said on Friday -- had his favorites: Mr. Saint Laurent, Mr. Blass, Mr. de la Renta, the society hostesses Ms. Buckley and Ms. Guest, and also Jacqueline Kennedy, whom Mr. Fairchild called ""Her Elegance."" Those who fell off his list really fell off. ""He was a very creative journalist and publisher, and he was ruthless,"" said Bob Colacello, a special correspondent at Vanity Fair who profiled him in the early 1990s in an article titled ""Dr. Fair and Mr. Child.""

Kenneth Jay Lane, the jewelry designer, said, ""I always avoided becoming too friendly with him because people who did, he would turn against."" So did the designer Valentino and his partner at the time, Giancarlo Giammetti. In the 1970s they came to New York on a trip, where they were trailed by a WWD reporter, Rosemary Kent. When they barred her from following them on a subsequent vacation, Valentino went from being the ""sheikh of chic"" to persona non grata. ""For months, Fairchild would run photos of Valentino and Giancarlo at parties with their faces airbrushed out,"" Mr. Colacello said. ""Their faces would be a gray circle, and beside them would be a caption that said 'Nan Kempner, Pat Buckley, with Italian Designer.' "" Geoffrey Beene and Mr. Fairchild got into a feud in the early 1980s. According to Fairchild loyalists, Mr. Beene became incensed when WWD decided to send a young, unseasoned reporter to cover his collection. According to Beene loyalists, Mr. Fairchild was retaliating against Mr. Beene for giving an exclusive on one of his houses to Architectural Digest. Fifteen years later, the bitterness remained. By then, as Mr. Fairchild told The New York Observer, ""I don't even know what it is about anymore."" As a journalist Mr. Fairchild had a keen eye for talent. Among those who worked for him early in their careers were the photographers Steven Meisel and The New York Times's Bill Cunningham; the Times theater critic Ben Brantley; the Times fashion critic Amy M. Spindler (who died in 2004); and the editors Andre Leon Talley and Bonnie Fuller. By the late 1980s, Mr. Fairchild began to loosen his grip. Mr. McCarthy was reconceiving W as a glossy monthly, and the personalities were changing. ""Say whatever you want about women like Gloria Guinness and Babe Paley, but they were interesting,"" Mr. McCarthy said, referring to two of the most prominent socialites of the postwar years. ""And he realized that at a certain point they didn't sell the clothes, and that a TV actress of no import did. He didn't like it."" In 1997, Mr. Fairchild announced his retirement, though he continued to hound his editors. ""He was full of vim and vigor,"" and he had been ""talkative and had story ideas up until a few weeks ago,"" Mr. Fallon said. Mr. Fairchild is survived by his wife, Jill; his sons John, James and Stephen; his daughter, who is also named Jill; and eight grandchildren.","As publisher and editor, Mr. Fairchild transformed his family's fusty trade publication into a must-read among fashion elites.",c905825a-fa82-5503-82b7-41d5e2fd2abe,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/28/business/28fairchild-2-obit/28fairchild-2-obit-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=e728262748f41d1b70fdfe3cfcac0f139b05c6fc72db6692c7255dd2c2cf05a9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"John Fairchild, shown with covers of W magazine in 1976.",c905825a-fa82-5503-82b7-41d5e2fd2abe,N24News/imgs/c905825a-fa82-5503-82b7-41d5e2fd2abe.jpg,16
Sports,N.W.S.L. Players Kneel for Anthem as League Returns to Field,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/sports/soccer/nwsl-anthem-protest-kaiya-mccullough.html,"It almost didn't feel like a choice to Kaiya McCullough. She was 19, a U.C.L.A. sophomore with hopes of becoming a professional women's soccer player, when she first decided to take a knee during the national anthem. ""I remember being so compelled -- it was an energy all of a sudden,"" McCullough said. ""I need to kneel. I need to do this."" So, long before George Floyd's killing sparked worldwide protests, long before she was drafted into the National Women's Soccer League and long before she started training for the start of her pandemic-shortened first season with the Washington Spirit, McCullough knew she would take a knee as a professional athlete, too.

On Saturday, though, she was not alone. Before the N.W.S.L.'s first game of its rebooted season, every starter from the Portland Thorns, the league's most popular team, and the North Carolina Courage, the league's defending champion, took a knee during the national anthem. The players said the action, which they had debated this week in their locker rooms -- and which gave each player the choice to take part or not -- was a protest against ""racial injustice, police brutality and systemic racism against Black people and people of color in America."" ""We love our country and we have taken this opportunity to hold it to a higher standard,"" the players from the teams said in a joint statement. ""It is our duty to demand that the liberties and freedoms this nation was founded upon are extended to everyone.""

McCullough, whose Spirit was scheduled to face the Chicago Red Stars later on Saturday, had made public her decision to kneel weeks ago. A 22-year-old rookie defender, she knows her decision to continue kneeling comes with real risks, and that the last N.W.S.L. player to do it, Megan Rapinoe in 2016, had faced a hailstorm of criticism. But the debate around kneeling and the role athletes can play in conversations about social justice has shifted in recent months. When the N.W.S.L. became the first professional team sports league in the United States to return to play, kicking off a monthlong tournament in Utah, it did so with Black Lives Matter shirts and armbands, and with players on one knee.

""That might rub some fans the wrong way, but I honestly think that if you see it as being a flag issue and not a human issue at this point, I just don't really care,"" said Lynn Williams, a North Carolina Courage forward who was among those who took a knee before facing the Thorns. Colin Kaepernick's decision to take a knee during the national anthem before N.F.L. games became a cultural flash point in 2016. But Kaepernick's silent action, intended to raise awareness of racism and police brutality, has surged and spread around the world in the wake of mass protests of Floyd's killing while in police custody. Soccer players in France and Germany now kneel after goals, and entire teams in England's Premier League have taken a knee together at the start of each match.

But with most sports in the United States on pause during the coronavirus outbreak, the question of how American athletes would handle the renewed Black Lives Matter protests remained unanswered. After Rapinoe knelt in solidarity with Kaepernick during the anthem in 2016, becoming the first white player to do so, she faced immediate backlash, including from McCullough's new team, the Spirit. When Rapinoe's team faced the Spirit soon after she began kneeling, Washington unexpectedly played the national anthem while the teams were in the locker room. At the time, the team said it did not want Rapinoe to ""hijack"" the anthem. But McCullough said the Spirit, which now has a different majority owner, has said she will face no repercussions. ""The universe was looking out for me, getting drafted to where I did,"" she said. ""I've felt nothing but overwhelming support."" She made her intention to kneel clear in interviews earlier this month.

For McCullough, the seeds of her protest were sown during a childhood in conservative Orange County, Calif., where she grew up with a white mother and black father, playing a sport that remains overwhelmingly white in the United States. She said she was first seized by the realization that the country's promise of equality was not true for all Americans when she was in high school, during protests after the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. McCullough decided she could no longer stand for the Pledge of Allegiance at school. ""I didn't think of it as activism then,"" she said. ""I just thought, 'I can't stand and say this.'""

It angered many people at her school. Teachers sometimes gave her no choice but to stand, she said, and a boy she had considered a friend once erupted at her, telling her to ""go back to Africa."" At U.C.L.A., McCullough found a different culture. When she decided to kneel, her team found ways to show solidarity. They first took a knee as a group, and then those who wanted to stand during the anthem did. Sometimes, teammates knelt with her. Always, at least one put a hand on her shoulder. It wasn't always easy. During away games, there were sometimes catcalls, and there was a deluge of racist comments after TMZ picked up the story. McCullough was often nervous, she said, ""but I did it anyway."" She does not expect to be alone on Saturday, or to escape notice. The N.W.S.L.'s opening game, and the pregame protest, was aired nationally by CBS -- the first time a league game has been shown on broadcast television. (McCullough and the Spirit will take on the Chicago Red Stars later that day, on CBS's All Access streaming service.)","A rookie had vowed to continue to kneel during the anthem when the season began.

Movies,Russell Hornsby on 'The Hate U Give' and Complex Black Masculinity,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/movies/russell-hornsby-the-hate-u-give.html,"For two decades, Russell Hornsby has been doing what he describes as ""exchanging energies"" with the quiet yet impactful characters he's played onscreen -- men like Lyons, the money-strapped musician in ""Fences,"" and Isaiah Butler, the forlorn dad mourning his son in ""Seven Seconds."" It's something that has enabled him to embody the many complexities of Maverick, the Black Panther-reciting patriarch in last year's electrifying drama ""The Hate U Give,"" a role that has galvanized audiences. That's because Hornsby's heartfelt portrayal of a man who is strict yet loving, flawed yet sincere, forces viewers to confront cinema's deep-seated stereotypes of black masculinity. In this era of #BlackLivesMatter, Maverick has even greater significance when he encourages his teenage daughter, Starr (Amandla Stenberg), to speak out after she witnesses the police murder her friend. Being an ally for black girls and women is one of many things Hornsby shares with Maverick.

George Tillman Jr. narrates a sequence from his film where Maverick, played by Russell Hornsby, teaches his children how to behave around the police. ""My name is George Tillman Jr., and I am the director of ""The Hate U Give."" We always called this scene ""the talk."" The scene was actually in the middle of the book, but we decided very early on to move it at the top of the film. What I love about this scene is, outside, you see a normal neighborhood, with a lot of playing. It feels like a Saturday afternoon. But I cinematically wanted to move slowly towards this house, to really show that, while everyone is having a good time playing, there's important business being done with the Carter family. The first guy we see is Mav Carter. You see a guy who got braids, and he got a tattoo, so your assumption is that this guy is a gang member and he's up to no good. But as the scene sort of progressed, I love turning the scene on its head and seeing that he's not who you think he is."" ""Now, one day, you're all going to be with me, and you best bet we gonna get pulled over."" He's a guy who's a father, a husband, and he's talking about something that's a very serious issue, that he's telling them to put their hands on the table. ""You're going to see me with my hands like this."" What I love about this scene is that this feels like a normal conversation like somebody would have about the birds and the bees with their children. But this is a scene that's very normal in a lot of African-American families across the country, which is, how you keep your kids safe. How do you get them to understand how to act around police officers? It's all about a father protecting his family. ""It can get real dangerous, so don't argue with them. But keep -- "" The rehearsal for the scene was very important. It started off by rehearsing a scene with Lamar Johnson, who plays Seven, and Amandla Stenberg, who plays Starr. They rehearsed the scene, but they are not actually in the scene, but I only rehearsed it with them so they could have it as a backstory for them, moving forward, for the rest of the film. ""Now, just because we got to deal with this mess, don't you ever forget that being black is an honor, because you come from greatness."" But the young kids who played the scene in the film, I didn't rehearse with them. I wanted them to be on camera for the first time experiencing that. So what we do -- we're seeing three different kinds of dynamics in this scene, is understanding the subtext of what an African-American family go through in the inner city. We're seeing a father figure who is very present in the household. And we're seeing a relationship that shows a loving relationship between a husband and wife. Even though they have disagreements, we still see a love. ""You understand?"" George Tillman Jr. narrates a sequence from his film where Maverick, played by Russell Hornsby, teaches his children how to behave around the police.

Maverick is so unlike many of the other characters you've played. What attracted you to the role? He was unapologetically black. Angie Thomas [author of the best-selling book upon which the film is based] wrote such a man in the real sense of the word -- in terms of how I was raised, the black men I was raised by and how I've [been] stimulated in my life. This was an opportunity for me to honor those that raised me and allowed me to be the man that I am today, a husband and a father of two boys. [Maverick] loves his wife. He loves his children. He loves his community. We don't see enough of those men and they do exist. Maverick is, among other things, a champion for young black women and girls speaking up for themselves and others. As a father yourself, what is your relationship with that same principle? You have to understand, I was raised by a single black mother. I love my mother, my aunts and the women who helped raise me. I've had black women teachers. My wife is a black woman. I champion women; their causes, their independence, their femininity. Maverick is the kind of man that says both sons and daughters deserve to be loved and be raised with that sense of love. Wisdom needs to be imparted equally to your boys and your girls. We know that Maverick has been to jail in the past. He's been in a gang. He's cheated on his wife. But we're compelled to look beyond his flaws through your complex portrayal of black masculinity that we rarely get to see onscreen. Was that important for you as an actor and a black man? My belief is that your performances as an actor don't stray very far from who you are. There are very few true chameleons in this business who can transform [and pull] a total 180 from who they are. So when I look at Maverick, he is a reflection of me as I am a reflection of him. It's important for me, for other brothers to see, for sisters to see it. It's important for our society to see that this man exists. I want the audience to see my brothers, the men who are my friends that I hang around with, who are married and have children and who are responsible and [have] beautiful [relationships with] their wives.

We also see glimpses of black male vulnerability, like when Starr brings home Chris, who's white, which makes him question whether he's set a good enough example for her to want to bring home a black man. We're three-dimensional. Maverick has the capacity to be vulnerable. He has the capacity to listen. That's the daughter he raised with all that love and she's saying, Dad, I've got some of this love for you, too. That choked me up when I saw it again. Because a daughter can say to her father, No, you did right. You did what you were supposed to do. It's all good. I love the conversations between Maverick and his wife, Lisa, about whether to leave their neighborhood, which he thinks would be turning his back on the culture. And to what end? He's saying to himself, my people need me. But we have to know who we're fighting for and why, and how we're going to fight. As black people, we lose sight of that sometimes. We talk about revolution and quick change. We have to understand that that's not realistic. It's really evolution, change over time. It's really about putting a plan in place, understanding what your goals are and applying them every day. So, as much as Maverick preaches about the Black Panther Party and the revolution, what Lisa helps him understand is that, Baby, it's going to have to be an evolutionary process. There's been Oscar talk surrounding your performance. How do you feel about all the buzz? It's an honor for people to deem the work worthy of such talk. But because I am at the age I am with a wife and two children, it doesn't consume me. At the end of the day, I am in the business of telling stories, and that's what I want to continue to do. I don't want this to be it. I want Maverick to be the jumping-off point. I feel like after 20 years working as a professional, let's hit the reset button and build it up from here. What are the next 20 years going to look like as far as roles and opportunities? I'm excited about that.","The actor, considered a potential Oscar contender for his performance as a flawed but loving father, says, ""We don't see enough of those men and they do exist.""",06fb2420-12c4-5807-b5ca-9d7171ed951f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/12/arts/12russell-hornsby1SUB/12russell-hornsby1SUB-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=ca1188cd34aaf445acfd598a0a0a411d73043fe638db2558530f73c8f8e0044c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Russell Hornsby, in Los Angeles, says it's an honor to be part of the Oscar conversation but at 44, such talk ""doesn't consume me.""",06fb2420-12c4-5807-b5ca-9d7171ed951f,N24News/imgs/06fb2420-12c4-5807-b5ca-9d7171ed951f.jpg,5
Health,New York Subpoenas Banks and Financial Advisers for Sackler Records,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/health/sacklers-finances-purdue.html,"The New York state attorney general has begun issuing subpoenas to 33 financial institutions and investment advisers with ties to the Sackler family, part of an aggressive effort to track billions of dollars that prosecutors claim the family siphoned out of Purdue Pharma to hide profits gained from the company's opioid painkillers. The recipients of the subpoenas ranged from major Wall Street firms to obscure offshore holding companies as well as two family investment offices and four individual advisers , according to court documents. The action is part of a broad attempt to hold individual Sacklers, who are owners of Purdue Pharma, accountable in some measure for unleashing the opioid crisis that has killed more than 200,000 Americans over the past two decades. Purdue Pharma is widely seen as playing a central role in creating the opioid epidemic by misleading doctors about its drug OxyContin's addictive properties and playing down evidence that the drug was being abused. New York State and others, most recently Arizona, have charged that as reports grew about Purdue's marketing of OxyContin, the Sackler family began transferring money out of Purdue into a far-flung network of surrogate companies and foundations, installing successive generations of relatives as overseers, to keep the money away from the scrutiny of potential litigants.

Asked to comment on the subpoenas, a lawyer for several members of the Sackler family emailed a statement: ""The New York Attorney General settled with Purdue for $75,000 in 2015 after conducting an investigation into alleged deceptive advertising and business practices. The Attorney General's current claims are without merit and the subpoenas are improper."" The subpoenas were issued in connection with a lawsuit filed by the New York attorney general this year against members of the Sackler family. It claims that family members had shifted billions of dollars from the business to themselves each year beginning in 2007, the year the company and three top executives pleaded guilty to deceptive marketing in an agreement with federal prosecutors. The company paid a $600 million fine. ""The opioid epidemic has ravaged American communities for over a decade, while a single family has made billions profiting from death and destruction,"" said Letitia James, the New York attorney general. ""From the day we filed this complaint, we said the Sackler family would be held responsible for their despicable actions hooking our nation on OxyContin. We won't let up until we have delivered justice."" The New York lawsuit is seeking to claw back years of transferred funds, and to restrain the Sacklers from disposing of property. The raft of related subpoenas issued over the past few days is a major step toward untangling the vast financial web of the Sacklers' business empire -- the company's global ownership structure includes dozens of holding companies and other corporate entities -- and to follow the money trail to discover how funds were moved, under what circumstances and where they are now.

The legal theory behind the subpoenas is called ""fraudulent conveyance,"" an action typically pursued by creditors during the course of a bankruptcy proceeding. The claim usually seeks to determine whether a debtor has hidden money to elude potential creditors. The attorney general's move is somewhat novel: She argues that the way the Sacklers' assets and profits were funneled to various institutions is tantamount to fraudulent conveyance, and central to the state's liability claims against them. In moving their money around, the state's lawsuit says, the Sacklers demonstrated that they were well aware of the mounting problems related to the manufacturing and marketing of opioids, and that they knew they could be vulnerable to litigation. Last month, the State of Arizona, which is also suing members of the Sackler family, took the unusual step of filing a lawsuit in the United States Supreme Court asking it to order the Sacklers to return what it said were billions of dollars channeled from the company while it was facing potentially massive liabilities. That lawsuit claimed Purdue transferred more than $4 billion to the Sacklers from 2008 through 2016.

None of the subpoenas issued in recent days target the Sacklers. Rather, they were issued to entities that did business with the members of the family or are part of the global ownership structure of Purdue. The subpoenas do not suggest that the recipients are themselves the subject of litigation by the state -- only that New York is seeking depositions and mountains of documents, in some cases dating back to 1996, when OxyContin was introduced, to learn more about the Sackler enterprises. Among them are 10 large investment banks, including Citibank, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, HSBC Bank USA, Charles Schwab, Wells Fargo, UBS, Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase and HSBC Securities USA. The subpoenas cast a wide net, demanding the banks produce documents about all accounts, investments, wire and electronic money transfers, loan applications and mortgages, as well as bank statements, canceled checks and more.

The subjects of the subpoenas also include 13 corporate entities that are part of the global ownership structure of Purdue, including Rosebay Medical Company, Linarite Holdings, Perthlite Holdings, Data, Moonstone Holdings and Roselite Holdings. And the state is in the process of issuing subpoenas to four offshore entities that are part of Purdue, including Banela Corporation, which is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, and Millborne Trust Company Limited, incorporated in Jersey, a British island in the English Channel . Court documents say the offshore companies ""appear to have served as conduits for monies from Purdue"" and various holding companies, as well as from the Sacklers. The subpoenas demanded all documents related to the entities' formation, as well as information about all payments and monetary distributions, financial transfers to and from Purdue, and records of all communications with Purdue and any of the Sacklers. The office also is in the process of issuing a subpoena to Jonathan G. White of Jersey, whom it says is ""believed to be director of a number of Sackler-controlled entities"" that have also been conduits for the transfer of funds. Mr. White could not be immediately reached for comment. In addition, the state is issuing subpoenas to two family investment offices, Stillwater Holdings and Summer Road, demanding information about the amounts of money under their management for each investor, and information from 2007 to the present about where the money was invested, and any transfers of money or loans made. Subpoenas were also issued to Leslie Schreyer and Jeffrey Robins, who are with the law firm of Norton Rose Fulbri ght. Mr. Robins, a partner at the firm, whose expertise is described on its website as tax and estate planning for ""high net worth individuals and families,"" was named in court papers as the manager of three holding companies that are part of the global Purdue ownership structure. Mr. Schreyer, described by the firm as an expert in ""tax planning and tax controversies,"" is named in the subpoena as manager of four holding companies.",The state claims that the Purdue Pharma owners transferred billions of dollars from the company and hid them in offshore partnerships and other entities.,46123ca4-7eba-505d-938f-3a44e7b193ea,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/15/science/15SACKLER/15SACKLER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=f12a4d54f9c46f0daed7558b03b84bfb6998fec7ea78a484e5e904aaa6de82da&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"New York's attorney general, Letitia James, filed suit in March accusing Sackler family members who own the company that manufactures Oxycontin of hiding money in offshore accounts and elsewhere.",46123ca4-7eba-505d-938f-3a44e7b193ea,N24News/imgs/46123ca4-7eba-505d-938f-3a44e7b193ea.jpg,1
Global Business,European Leaders Question Timing of Credit Downgrade Warning,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/07/business/global/germany-calls-sp-threat-a-spur-to-action.html,"BRUSSELS -- European Union leaders reacted angrily Tuesday over the timing of a warning of a broad credit rating downgrade days before a European summit meeting. And German officials portrayed the threat by Standard & Poor's as impetus for leaders to make a deal to rescue the euro. Late Monday, S.& P. warned that the ratings of 15 euro zone countries, including Germany and France, were vulnerable to a downgrade. On Tuesday, the agency extended its threat of a possible downgrade to include the top-notch, long-term credit rating on the European Union's main bailout fund, if any of its gilt-edged guarantors were downgraded. Though rating agencies have made announcements before previous meetings on the euro debt crisis, Monday's warning was striking. Market indexes in the euro zone closed down Tuesday, while the yields on German and French bonds rose, a sign of added risk to holders of the securities. The European commissioner responsible for financial market regulation, Michel Barnier, complained that S.& P. had acted without waiting to evaluate the results of the coming two-day summit meeting in Brussels.

Jean-Claude Juncker, who heads the group of euro zone finance ministers, added during an interview on German radio, ""I have to wonder that this news reaches us out of the clear blue sky at the time of the European summit -- this can't be a coincidence."" This time S.& P.'s downgrade threat was effectively a warning to European leaders of the consequences that would flow from failure to take sufficiently convincing action. Few now dispute the central thrust of the argument advanced by the rating agency that the economy of the euro zone is deteriorating so rapidly that quick and far-reaching action is required to avert disaster. ""I actually see a positive effect, because now everyone must be aware of how serious the situation is,"" Norbert Barthle, the budget spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party in Germany, told Reuters. The German finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, called it the ""best encouragement"" to find a solution.

S.& P.'s statement will prompt European leaders ""to do what we've promised, namely to take the necessary decisions step by step and to win back the confidence of global investors,"" Mr. Schauble said. A report on Tuesday from Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, outlined a fast-track option for creating a tighter fiscal framework, or ""fiscal compact,"" for the 17 countries in the European Union that use the euro. This method would rush changes through and avoid the need for time-consuming approval in all 27 European Union nations. The hope among many European officials is that an accord along these lines will give the European Central Bank political cover to intervene more aggressively to ease the crisis. It was unclear on Tuesday, however, whether the more limited ""quick fix"" solution -- as opposed to a full modification of the European Union treaty -- would allow enough change to satisfy Germany. Speaking on a visit to Germany, the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, praised recent efforts of European leaders to forge a stronger fiscal union. ""I am very encouraged by the developments in Europe in the past few weeks,"" including the reform commitments in Italy, Spain, and Greece, and new steps toward a ""fiscal compact,"" he said in Berlin. Asked about an enhanced role for the International Monetary Fund, Mr. Geithner responded that it was playing an important role, and that he expected it to continue to do so. He said the United States continued to support the fund ""in the context of the efforts Europeans are making to build a stronger Europe."" Speaking in Brussels, Mr. Barnier rejected the idea that the S.& P. announcement was an act of revenge after the European Commission announced plans last month to tighten regulation of rating agencies.

In fact, had the new rules been in place, they would not have covered Monday's statement. ""Our proposals apply to ratings, rather than warnings, though it might be worthwhile to discuss whether they should apply to both,"" said Chantal Hughes, a spokeswoman for Mr. Barnier. Mr. Van Rompuy's paper outlined the possibility that the euro zone's new permanent bailout mechanism should be allowed to recapitalize banks and should itself have ""the necessary features of a credit institution."" The paper also keeps open the longer-term option of euro bonds -- something ruled out by Mrs. Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy of France on Monday. But its main point is that an amendment of Protocol 12 of the founding European Union treaty could be agreed upon by leaders, who would simply have to consult with the European Central Bank and the European Parliament. ""This decision does not require ratification at national level,"" the document said. This way countries would write into their own law an obligation ""to reach and maintain a balanced budget over the economic cycle."" This could be complemented with pledges of ""automatic reductions in expenditures, increases in taxes or a combination of both"" when the rule was broken. More fundamental changes and ""an enhanced role for the E.U. institutions, with a higher intrusiveness in the case of lack of implementation,"" would mean full treaty change, the document said. On Tuesday, the French prime minister, Francois Fillon, indicated that his country was contemplating a full-scale revision of the treaty when he laid down a timetable to French parliamentarians. ""Our objective it to reach a deal in March 2012 that would be ratified by the end of 2012,"" Mr. Fillon said, Reuters reported from Paris.",European Union leaders reacted angrily on Tuesday over the timing of Standard & Poor's downgrade threat days before a European summit meeting.,4ce6bb04-145d-5395-8eab-18c1bcc70960,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/12/07/business/EURO/EURO-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=313&w=600&s=936de526f8714c04bf41d312ef8cafc2b298ca0287959bf4fbcf3ad05cfaa0aa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, left, with Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, praised European efforts to forge a stronger fiscal union.",4ce6bb04-145d-5395-8eab-18c1bcc70960,N24News/imgs/4ce6bb04-145d-5395-8eab-18c1bcc70960.jpg,24
Real Estate,"South Williamsburg, Brooklyn: Where Families Are Out in Force",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/realestate/south-williamsburg-brooklyn-where-families-are-out-in-force.html,"When Nasrin Vossoughian bought a three-bedroom condominium at Schaefer Landing, a residential project built on the site of a former brewery, she knew change was coming to gritty South Williamsburg, Brooklyn. But she had no idea how much. That was in the early 2000s, before the rezoned waterfront was lined with gymnastic towers and its most prominent feature, the Domino Sugar Factory, was remade into a four-million-square-foot multiuse complex that is still under construction. Ms. Vossoughian and her husband were living in upstate Cornwall-on-Hudson, N.Y., at the time, and bought the property as an investment. (She declined to say what they paid, but units were originally priced up to $1.9 million.) After she was widowed, she moved into the condo for a change of scene and to be close to her Brooklyn grandchildren. ""I had enough of the country,"" she said. Sitting on a bench in the new Domino Park, with its sublime views of the Manhattan skyline and tributes to the sugar-refining industry -- syrup tanks, gantry cranes -- she talked about the pleasure of walking to increasingly profuse neighborhood shops and restaurants, and boarding a ferry just outside her door for the 20-minute trip to Lower Manhattan. If Ms. Vossoughian felt any sense of disconnect in this new environment, she said, it was because of her age: She is now 70. She was contrasting herself not just against the stereotypical skin-ornamented and creatively self-employed Williamsburg hipster, but also against the affluent young families pouring into the neighborhood.

""Once the L train decided it wasn't going to close, it really put Williamsburg back on the map in general for buyers and renters; the South Side has seen a lot of that interest,"" said Evan F. Church, a broker in Corcoran's Williamsburg office. Eyes that looked to the alternative J, M and Z trains, and to ferries to Wall Street, liked what they saw, especially with scaffolding coming down and exposing the shiny faces of new buildings. ""I'm seeing a lot of local residents from different parts of Williamsburg coming in and checking it out,"" Mr. Church said.

Ms. Lethen's efforts to improve the unsightly wall are the subject of a new short film called ""Requiem for Williamsburg: A Story of Hope."" Directed by Dutch filmmaker Yara Hannema, the documentary follows the artist through months of entanglements with the tower owner and ultimately shows her packing her car and moving to the Hudson River city of Newburgh, N.Y. In a phone conversation, Ms. Lethen, now 76, said she returns to Williamsburg about once a month to tend her garden. But despite the entreaties of developers whom she has found standing in her foyer (""The door was unlocked,"" they told her), she has no intention of selling. The house, now worth more than $3.6 million in Zillow's estimate, will be passed to her two grown sons. Sliced by the Williamsburg Bridge in one direction and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway in another, South Williamsburg had plenty of structural drama before it received its recent spate of towers. Older buildings bounce from short, sober brick to Victorian Gothic to cast-iron classicism to the domed limestone hulk of the Williamsburgh Savings Bank, which has become an event space called Weylin and sits across from the venerable Peter Luger Steak House on Broadway. A 26-story hotel and condo building is planned for the site next door. Nearby, a 23-story office, retail and apartment tower called the Dime is rising behind the soon-to-be-restored 1908 Dime Savings Bank. The neighborhood is culturally lively, too, with Hasidic Jews filling the blocks approaching Bedford-Stuyvesant to the south, and a Puerto Rican and Dominican population concentrated in the north. The eastern border is widely agreed to be Union Avenue. Everyone mixes in the public green spaces along the river to the west.

""When we built Domino Park, we made an effort, and I think we were incredibly successful, at appealing to a wider cross section of the broader neighborhood,"" said Jed Walentas, the principal of Two Trees Management, which is developing the 11-acre site. ""I'm not a huge believer in boundaries of neighborhoods per se, unless they're things like rivers."" A 16-story rectangle with a hollow center at 325 Kent Avenue that opened in 2017 is the first completed building in the Domino complex. It has 522 rentals, including 104 affordable units. Up next is the 42-story One South First, an interlocking pair of mixed-use towers that will have 330 rentals, 66 of them affordable, and an outpost of the beloved Bushwick restaurant Roberta's. Plans for the fortresslike brick refinery building are to insert a glass office building within it. In January, leasing began for 420 Kent Avenue, a new luxury apartment complex on the river developed by former New York governor Eliot Spitzer, with 857 units; available market-rate studios start at $3,040. Twenty percent of the units are deemed affordable and priced from $867 a month for studios to $1,123 a month for two-bedrooms. As old neighborhood favorites have fallen away (farewell Death by Audio, Moon River Chattel), a new generation has set up shop in South Williamsburg. One member is Jennifer Plotnick, who founded Grand Street Dental in a chic storefront three years ago and now has 7,774 Instagram followers. 429 KENT AVENUE, APT. TH2 | A four-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bathroom, 3,384 square-foot condo at the four-year-old Oosten, listed for $3.925 million. 929-436-0620 ""What's always great about Williamsburg,"" she said, is that ""it doesn't matter what time of day it is; people are always around.""

Cedric Cadin, who opened a bistro called La Cafette last year at the corner of Havemeyer and Hope Streets, just above Grand, said his choice of neighborhood was motivated by the planned L train closing and the prediction that more people would move closer to the Marcy Avenue station, less than 10 minutes on foot from his restaurant. Mr. Cadin relocated from his native France for this venture, and said he is still looking for a permanent place to live in South Williamsburg, but is stymied by the high rents. ""If I compare it to Paris,"" he said, ""it's just crazy, crazy, crazy."" According to data posted on Trulia's website, the median rental price of apartments in Williamsburg (North, South and East) between May 4 and June 4 was $2,587. The median sale price, as of May 29, was $999,999, a year-over-year increase of 16 percent. Although breakdowns were not made for sub-neighborhoods, current listings show that the difference in price between north and south seems to increase as the properties get more expensive. Of the 33 homes in South Williamsburg on Zillow as of June 17, the lowest price for an apartment with no HDFC income restrictions was $695,000 for a 555-square-foot studio in the Gretsch, a 1916 factory building at 60 Broadway that was converted into condominiums in 2003; it had a monthly homeowner fee of $442 and annual taxes of $3,011. By comparison, the lowest-priced listing among the 49 homes in North Williamsburg was $685,000 for a 509-square-foot studio in a 2009 condominium on North 11th Street, a block from McCarren Park; the monthly homeowner fee was $430 and the most recently reported taxes (in 2017) were $3,403. Among the South Williamsburg listings, the median asking price was $1.45 million for a two-bedroom duplex condo in a 23-unit building on South Second Street, across from Domino Park; the monthly homeowner fee was $677 and the annual property taxes were $521 (with a 25-year tax abatement that expires in 2036). In North Williamsburg, the median asking price was $1.745 million for a two-bedroom condo with a roof deck at North Seventh and Berry; the homeowner fee was $798 a month and the annual taxes were $725. The most expensive South Williamsburg property was a $4.68 million, four-bedroom duplex condo loft on Wythe Avenue and South First Street, in a converted 1914 factory building. The monthly homeowner fee was $313 a month and the annual taxes were $11,051. The costliest listing in North Williamsburg was a $5.995 million, fully furnished, two-bedroom condo loft in a converted 1910 factory building on North Third Street near Wythe Avenue; the monthly homeowner fee was $1,791; the annual taxes (with an abatement until 2025) were $233 a year.

The elevated train station at Marcy Avenue is served by the J, M and Z trains. The J and M also stop at Hewes Street. Ferries depart about every 20 minutes between 6:57 a.m. and 10:11 p.m. from 440 Kent Avenue. The trip to Wall Street Pier 11 takes 23 minutes. Domino Park is not the only site preserving tokens of South Williamsburg's vibrant past. In 2016, a Greenwich Village boxing gym called Overthrow took over the Grand Street address of the Trash Bar, a beloved rock 'n' roll dive that was priced out of the neighborhood after 11 years. The Trash Bar's name was also a decor theme, and Overthrow has kept the grungy interior and graffitied exterior more or less intact.

Books,Bringing Favorite Fairy Tales Up to Date,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/books/review/new-fairy-tales-rebecca-solnit.html,"A fairy tale, in its essence, is a story of reversal. Silent and impoverished girls discover not only voices, but jewels and riches pouring from their mouths; the castoff and abandoned find unexpected families and birthrights; mad kings and wicked stepmothers lose status, kingdoms and even lives. A fairy tale has no toleration for ambiguities. It is abrupt, immediate and often brutal -- more tip of the blade than bonny glen. The dangers are real and they are everywhere. Tread carefully, these stories remind us. Keep your eyes open. Be kind and generous and fair. And for God's sake, don't succumb to greed, because that never ends well. For readers steeped in the wonder and precision of fairy tales, unable to resist diving into yet another retelling (and I place myself in this category), three new books take the fabric of some old stories, and, with a keen eye and a very sharp needle, reshape each one into something new. Rebecca Solnit's CINDERELLA LIBERATOR (Haymarket, 48 pp., $17.99; ages 6 and up) applies subtle shifts and gentle questions to recast this familiar story into a tale that is fundamentally about freedom. In Solnit's version, Cinderella begins as the original: She is lonely and overworked and unloved, deprived of comforts and even her own name. She longs for friendship and connection and, delightfully, to one day run her own cake shop. When the fairy godmother arrives and asks for mice (to become horses) and a rat (to become the coachwoman) and a group of lizards (to be transformed into footwomen), the story begins to alter from the original. ""Do lizards want to become footwomen?"" Cinderella wonders out loud, setting the stage for larger questions about consent, choice, self-determination and liberty.

While the narration very occasionally gets more heavy-handed than it ought to, largely the tone remains clear, deft and purposeful, as the form requires. The decision to use Arthur Rackham's original cut-paper silhouette illustrations was a brilliant choice. And for the true book nerd, Solnit's backmatter explores the deeper meaning of the Cinderella story, and the light it sheds on the plight of the downtrodden and subjugated even today. Solnit shares the stories of women in her own family who persisted through destitution and despair -- they were Cinderella stories sans happy endings. ""Their tragedies,"" Solnit concludes, ""were a century ago and more, but this book is also with love and hope for every child who's overworked and undervalued, every kid who feels alone -- with hope that they get to write their own story, and make it come out with love and liberation."" This is, hands down, a wonderful book -- one that even the jaded reader will clasp upon completion with a contented sigh.

Ben Nadler retells one of my favorite fairy tales in THE WHITE SNAKE (Toon Books, 64 pp., $16.99; ages 8 to 12), turning it into a fast-paced and irreverent graphic novel. The result is funny, engaging and an absolute delight. In Nadler's version, the status-obsessed King Arnold sends his servant Randall to spy on his neighbor, King Boris, to discover the secrets of that ruler's fabled wisdom. This gambit occurs over the strenuous objections of Princess Tilda, both friend to Randall and exasperated conscience to her father, King Arnold. It is clear from the outset that Princess Tilda is far more suited for kingship than her father, but listening is not one of King Arnold's strong points. Randall makes the journey to the next kingdom, and King Boris hires him straight away. As in the original tale, Randall discovers that King Boris eats a magical white snake each night, for secret reasons. Consumed with curiosity, Randall takes a bite, and discovers that he now, like the king, has been given the gift of speaking with animals. This is where Nadler's telling begins to diverge from the original. On Randall's long journey home, the animals he meets are more than just helpers or props. Rather, in his interactions with a beached fish, an imperiled ant colony and a nest of orphaned ravens, Randall sees himself as equal to his animal brethren -- recognizing that he owes kindness and generosity to each of them, just as he would for his fellow humans. It is not from the ability to speak to animals that wisdom derives, Randall now understands, but rather from the act of listening. King Arnold (who has been growing madder and more irrational by the day) is sorely lacking in that regard, Randall realizes, and can't be trusted with the secret of the white snake. In the end, it is Princess Tilda's agency and ingenuity that spurs the story forward. Kindness and fairness are rewarded, wisdom is a gift generously given, and the burden of the crown lands at last on the cool head of the wise girl who knows how to use it. Marriage, in this ""White Snake,"" is no longer the prize of a hero's journey, but rather the partnership of equals. Perhaps not the most revolutionary of story lines, but in the context of this zippy, irreverent and comic retelling of the classic tale, it is profoundly satisfying all the same. The book ends with an unexpected treat: a section delving into the history of the fairy tale as well as the philosophy underpinning this retelling.

Jessie Burton's THE RESTLESS GIRLS (Bloomsbury, 160 pp., $19.99; ages 8 to 12), illustrated by Angela Barrett, takes another favorite story of mine, ""The Twelve Dancing Princesses,"" and weaves a story of female empowerment, agency and sisterhood. In the start of this tale, the 12 daughters of the king and queen of Kalia live an idyllic life. Each girl possesses the support and encouragement to explore her divergent interests and pursuits (including painting, botany, aviation, mathematics, music, veterinary science). When their mother dies following a tragic crash in her beloved racecar, the king goes mad with grief. He blocks the sunlight from the windows, and music from the halls, and, horribly, locks the girls in a windowless room where they must spend all of their days. For their safety, he insists. But this is a fairy tale, after all, and we are ready for the reversal. A painting hides a secret door, which leads to a castle built in a tree, complete with a peacock in a waistcoat and an animal jazz band and a lioness acting as both gracious hostess and enigmatic wizard. The discovery of this secret world makes their lives in the grief-shrouded castle bearable, but the eldest, Frida, knows that it can't last forever. The ways in which Burton diverges from the source text are both satisfying and unexpected -- and I won't tell you what they are, for that would be a terrible spoiler. What I will say is this: ""The Restless Girls"" is one of the prettiest books I've seen in a long time. Barrett's artwork is exquisite, and provides another layer to the story that is not explicitly explored in the text (the girls and their mother are all depicted as black and biracial, and as suffering under the increasing irrationality and restrictions of the white, mad king; the royal advisers and visiting princes represent a wide range of racial backgrounds). Despite this beauty, the narration, while maintaining a controlled, nimble and energetic tone in the beginning and again in the end, alas, becomes overwrought and diffuse in the middle. This is a danger for fairy tale retellings, generally, and why so many of them fail. The form requires taut, precise storytelling; spongy over-explanations do not suit it. It is disappointing that Burton succumbs to this, given the sly prose she offers at the story's outset. Still, in spite of this miscalculation I enjoyed the book, and I hope Burton, who is an actress and the author of novels for adults including ""The Muse,"" will be offering even more for children in the future.","These new takes on beloved old stories deliver empowered princesses and racial diversity while staying true to the genre's stark, dangerous heart.",f0755752-ebd1-5f4f-9ada-fc26e762ed19,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/19/books/review/19Barnhill-01/19Barnhill-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=05a55d7da8860848ee6cdae27ad0285cddac28bfb992ac35d983b28caeac7a68&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From ""Cinderella Liberator.""",f0755752-ebd1-5f4f-9ada-fc26e762ed19,N24News/imgs/f0755752-ebd1-5f4f-9ada-fc26e762ed19.jpg,13
Media,Behind the Scenes at Disney as It Purged a Favorite Son,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/08/business/media/behind-the-scenes-at-disney-as-it-purged-a-favorite-son.html,"Thomas O. Staggs, then the chief financial officer of the Walt Disney Company, was having lunch with Robert A. Iger and other high-ranking Disney executives in 2003 in the company's boardroom when food lodged in Mr. Iger's windpipe. With Mr. Iger struggling to breathe and turning red, another executive started pounding his back, to no effect. Mr. Staggs leapt up, and applied the Heimlich maneuver so forcefully that he broke one of Mr. Iger's ribs. Out popped a piece of chicken. In the byzantine world of Hollywood media conglomerates, not even saving the future chief executive's life confers any job security. In a throwback to the tumultuous era of Disney's former chief executive, Michael D. Eisner, who anointed -- and then discarded -- a series of potential successors, Mr. Staggs was purged this week. Just a year ago, it appeared that Mr. Iger and Disney's board had turned the page on Disney's troubled past and executed the delicate task of succession at the top with the same flawless precision they brought to December's premiere of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens.""

In 2010, Mr. Iger named Mr. Staggs chairman of the company's theme park division, broadening his management experience while putting him in a horse race with Jay Rasulo, who replaced Mr. Staggs as chief financial officer. Last year Mr. Staggs emerged the winner. Mr. Iger named him chief operating officer, and Mr. Rasulo departed. It was literally a textbook case of a smooth succession: The Stanford business school professor David F. Larcker used it as an example in the latest edition of his book ""Corporate Governance Matters."" Disney ""went through a process that seemed very sensible and effective,"" Professor Larcker told me this week. ""Within a year it has all unraveled. That's a nightmare scenario for the board and the company."" Disney said Mr. Iger, who is 65 and has been running Disney since 2005, still plans to retire as scheduled in 2018, a little more than two years from now. But there is no immediate successor within the company, and no obvious candidate outside it.

They have children close in ages. They and their families vacationed together on the maiden voyage of the Disney cruise ship Fantasy, and shared several trips to Walt Disney World. Mr. Staggs had every reason to believe he was on track to succeed Mr. Iger. During the year since Mr. Staggs was named to the No. 2 position, Disney had moved from one triumph to another: an Oscar for the revived animation unit's ""Big Hero 6""; lavish praise and box office success for Pixar's ""Inside Out;"" vindication of the Marvel acquisition with another smash ""Avengers"" hit; the record-setting opening of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens."" And then there is Disney's most ambitious project of all: the imminent unveiling of its $5.5 billion Shanghai Disneyland resort, Mr. Staggs's major achievement as theme park chairman. In the year that Mr. Staggs was chief operating officer, first-quarter earnings jumped 36 percent to a record $2.9 billion. True, Disney's stock price, along with market averages, was down. After peaking at over $120 in August, it was trading this week at just under $100. But that decline was set off by Mr. Iger's comments to analysts that growth at the Disney-owned sports network ESPN was slowing under subscriber losses. Until then, Disney had been the best-performing stock in the Dow Jones industrial average for 2015.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Mr. Iger also appeared to be laying the groundwork for his own next act: to lead the National Football League's return to Los Angeles after a 21-year absence. Mr. Iger was granted options to buy minority stakes in the Raiders and Chargers and was named chairman of a holding company that would move the teams to Los Angeles and oversee the building of a new stadium and adjacent real estate development. Mr. Iger met with N.F.L. owners in Houston in January to pitch the deal. According to a detailed account in the Disney-owned ESPN the Magazine, Mr. Iger's legendary charm fell flat with the league owners, who opted for a rival bid on Jan. 12. Mr. Iger's franchise options were terminated.

Perhaps the timing was simply coincidence. A person close to the board said that the collapse of the deal had nothing to do with Mr. Iger's evaluation of Mr. Staggs, and that Mr. Iger became involved with the N.F.L. out of a sense of civic duty. Had the bid succeeded, it would have been at most a part-time job. In any event, in the following weeks board discussions about Mr. Staggs's future intensified. Unknown to Mr. Staggs, some on the board had resisted naming him chief operating officer the year before, but Mr. Iger had prevailed. Those reservations surfaced again periodically, focusing on whether Mr. Staggs was the ideal person to lead Disney over the next 10 years, a period likely to take the company into the uncharted waters of the continuing digital revolution and the post-cable era. In mid-March, Mr. Iger summoned Mr. Staggs to his office and dropped a bombshell: Mr. Staggs lacked the full confidence of both Mr. Iger and the Disney board, which had been discussing Mr. Staggs's performance at recent board meetings. Mr. Iger told him Disney was going to broaden its search for his successor. Mr. Iger didn't say explicitly that Mr. Staggs was out of the running, but the message was clear. Mr. Iger made no effort to persuade Mr. Staggs to stay. He offered no specific criticisms, according to a person close to Mr. Staggs, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to disclose company matters publicly. Instead, Mr. Iger offered only a vague reference to Mr. Staggs's lack of vision. The next week both men were away, spending spring break with their families. After they returned, they discussed the terms and timing of Mr. Staggs's departure, which they decided would be announced this past Monday. In making the announcement, Mr. Iger praised Mr. Staggs's contributions and called him a ""great friend.""

Disney insists that the decision had nothing to do with Mr. Iger's wanting to extend his tenure. Given his superb track record at Disney, he could surely stay as long as he wants. Unlike the situation when Mr. Eisner left, Disney is by no means in crisis. The animation unit, film operations and theme parks, in particular, seem to be firing on all cylinders. But the person who has close ties to the board told me that board members have been keenly interested in succession and, given Disney's history, very aware of the perils of a chief executive who stays too long. With Mr. Staggs gone, and no other obvious candidate to take his place, the board may have little choice but to beg Mr. Iger to stay. ""If you're a Disney board member, your workload has just gone up a lot and you're going to get a lot of scrutiny,"" Professor Larcker said. ""Now they have to get someone better than Staggs. That's going to be a pretty high bar.""",Thomas Staggs's departure from the No. 2 position at the media giant leaves no clear successor for Robert Iger as chief executive.,bcd1e580-f0ba-534c-b566-20b1f2b13e6f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/08/business/08STEWART/08STEWART-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=9e91dc04eef1a33cbf3bf87e37747f04507d2cb309c097e8544f0c72689e129a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"In recent months Robert A.

Shaded by royal palms and fruit trees in a bucolic pocket of a residential neighborhood, the estate, called Casa Huerta, ""exudes calmness and serenity,"" said Alec Quevedo, an agent with Ricardo Amigo Real Estate, which has the listing. The two one-bedroom concrete houses, built in 2004, stand about 80 feet apart at the center of the rectangular lot, each with an outdoor parking area. The 900-square-foot main house, painted reddish ocher, has an A-frame veranda with a dining table and lounge furniture. Inside is an open-plan living room with concrete floors, built-in concrete bookshelves and sofas, and double-height palm-thatch ceilings. The kitchen, which looks out on the veranda, has poured-concrete counters and shelves.

The houses are connected by a stone walkway. Four sliding hardwood pocket doors open to the 700-square-foot guesthouse, which has a living room with an open kitchen, vaulted ceilings, built-in sofas and Mexican parota-wood cabinets. The bedroom, up two steps, has a half bathroom. A Balinese-style free-standing bathhouse with a full bathroom is across a private courtyard. A second sleeping area, in a loft above the kitchen, can be reached by an exterior staircase. The property is being sold partially furnished. The coastal town of Todos Santos, with about 6,500 residents, has long attracted artists with its artisanal shops and galleries. It is also popular with surfers, who ride the breaks at Playa Cerritos, about 20 minutes south of town. The Playa La Cachora beach is an eight-minute drive. Los Cabos, a world-renowned vacation destination with its 20-mile Resort Corridor, is 50 miles south. Los Cabos International Airport is about 75 minutes away. While Todos Santos is less than an hour from Los Cabos, but it can feel a world away, agents said. Los Cabos, a region that includes the beach cities of San Jose del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas, tends toward volume -- in resorts, cruise ships, entertainment, golf -- while Todos Santos, designated a Pueblo Magico, or magical town, by Mexico's Secretariat of Tourism, gets a trickle of day trippers. ""Todos Santos is more of a quaint village, with more of an authentic Mexican flavor to it,"" said Bernardo Mucino Koenig, the managing director of the Agency Los Cabos. But he and other agents said the vibe has been shifting in recent years, with new hotels and residential developments setting the local housing market on a new course.

""The last years have been really busy,"" Mr. Quevedo said. ""We've kind of had a little bit of an explosion -- it's a small town, so I use the word 'explosion' lightly, of course."" Condos are under construction, he said, but most of the offerings are ""quirky, artistic homes."" Nick Fong, the broker at Los Cabos Agent, compared Todos Santos to Cabo San Lucas 30 years ago, when the Mexican government began promoting the once-rural area as a global hot spot. ""Lot prices are going up; things are doubling in price,"" he said, noting that in Todos Santos and ""fringe"" areas east of Los Cabos, prices for vacant lots have increased from $20,000 for an ocean-view quarter-acre in 2018 to $40,000 or $50,000 in early 2020. But the market has stalled since the Covid-19 pandemic led to the closure of the U.S.-Mexico border for nonessential travel, Mr. Fong said. In late March, his agency was getting two offers a week, down from the usual five or six, and he expects that number to keep falling. ""We'll be lucky to see even one"" a week, he said. Properties in the area usually sell for about 10 percent below their asking price, he said, ""mainly due to the fact that we are a second-home market."" But that discount will likely deepen given the recent drop in tourism, which drives home sales, he added: ""Any sales that will happen in the next few months will probably have a 10 to 20 percent less sale price than it would do in a -- let's call it a normal market, a pre-corona market.""

In Todos Santos, the most common residence is a ""middle-income, single-standing home"" that sells for $300,000 to $500,000, Mr. Koenig said, adding that more expensive hacienda-style properties with olive groves and farms are available, but are not the norm. In Los Cabos, high-end options abound. Luxury condos sell for $1 million to $3.5 million, he said. Ultraluxury communities like El Dorado Golf & Beach Club and Maravilla Los Cabos offer condos and lots for custom homes; a beachfront property there could top $15 million, he said. Blake Harrington, the managing partner of REmexico Real Estate, a Cabo San Lucas-based agency, said Los Cabos also has more affordable properties, including ocean-view condos for around $400,000, as well as ""some great options at or around $250,000 that give you the right location to enjoy Cabo, or San Jose del Cabo, without breaking the bank.""

Mr. Fong said three-quarters of his buyers are from the United States, and many of the rest are from Canada. Other agencies, he said, have had a few buyers from China, England and Spain. Recently, more foreigners have been moving to the region full-time rather than buying second homes there, he said. Mr. Koenig said about 70 to 80 percent of his agency's clients are from the United States, and the rest are from Canada. Three-quarters of the buyers at Mr. Harrington's agency are from the United States, he said, and many of the others are from Canada and Mexico. With the increase in short-term rentals in the region, he added, the share of buyers who rent out their properties has grown.","The artsy town of Todos Santos has long been a quiet alternative to the resorts of Los Cabos, but new demand and development is raising its profile.",b206fbde-ed50-5aef-87cb-7e05967b422f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/08/realestate/08IHH-MEXICO-slide-VM4F/08IHH-MEXICO-slide-VM4F-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=e165ad999a60fce5e0369279e35770dd8749f93458de535b30b67e7d0091701c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The 700-square-foot guesthouse has a living room with built-in sofas and Mexican parota-wood cabinets.,b206fbde-ed50-5aef-87cb-7e05967b422f,N24News/imgs/b206fbde-ed50-5aef-87cb-7e05967b422f.jpg,7
Your Money,Learning Young the Gift of Helping Others,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/05/your-money/teaching-children-philanthropy.html,"THE Moret girls, Zoe, Mia and Sophie, are given a choice when they turn 5: Have a birthday party of their choice with presents from their friends or have the same party but forgo the presents. This might seem like an exercise in futility for any parent. But so far, the two sisters older than 5 have both opted for no presents. They have asked instead for things that a local charity needs. For Zoe, now 8, her fifth birthday was a natural melding of her interests. ""I love princesses and I wanted to do something to help animals,"" she said. The result was a princess-themed party to benefit a local animal shelter. Guests brought what the shelter needed, from biscuits to bleach and copying paper.

""We got to drop off the things at the front desk,"" Zoe said. ""And then we got to go and look at the animals. We're basically at the point where we're going to get a new dog."" She added, ""My sisters do it as well. Sophie is still getting presents. But Mia is doing it and one year she wanted to do this thing with dolphins."" The Moret sisters are part of a small but growing group of children and teenagers who are engaging in charitable giving and being part of philanthropic advisories at a time when most children their age are focused on sports, music or just themselves. A study released in June by Fidelity Charitable, which manages donor-advised funds, found that philanthropic giving is increasingly a family affair and that children are getting involved at younger ages. Of the group with donor-advised funds -- admittedly a group skewed toward the charitably inclined -- 94 percent said they had taught or were teaching their children to give to charity. Still, 5 is young to most. Sammie Klainberg, 16, may be closer to what people have in mind when they think of philanthropically minded youth.

When she was 13, she took a trip with a Jewish youth group to San Francisco to spend several weeks volunteering. After working in soup kitchens and other organizations, she came back to Great Neck, N.Y., ""thinking, 'Oh my God, I have to help everyone right now,' "" she said. While she became involved in typical activities, like blood drives and runs to raise money, she has taken her philanthropy to a more sophisticated level through a grant-making group at her religious school associated with the Jewish Teen Funders Network. ""I spent the year facilitating and helping,"" she said. ""I read all the grant proposals. I worked toward building consensus within our group."" At the end of the year, the group gave several thousands dollars to a local organization that buys books and toys for underprivileged children. At a time when attention in philanthropy is being focused on billionaires who agree to give away a big chunk of their fortunes, Zoe and Sammie represent an interesting subset of socially minded children. Their altruism is not without challenges. It also carries bigger lessons than the amounts given away. The first challenge for these children is deciding on a project that is doable. Olivia Coutre, 12, said that last year she and three friends decided to organize a medicine drive to give essential drugs, like aspirin, to people who couldn't afford them. They quickly realized it was beyond their scope. ""You needed a doctor,"" she said. So instead they connected with an organization that supplies backpacks full of clothes and shoes to children in the Boston area, where she lives.

""We raised about $1,000,"" she said. ""We did lots of camps with little kids. We'd charge their parents about $20."" After raising money for several additional causes, the girls set up a website -- Giving Gals -- to let people know what they were doing and also to raise more funds. ""We have goals for money,"" she said. ""But we know it's good for people and it's good for us."" With most of these young philanthropists, their parents are involved in some form. Rebecca Dibble, 10, said she became interested in raising money to help girls in the Kibera slum of Nairobi, after visiting Kenya with her parents. Her father, Timothy, is on the board of Shining Hope for Communities, an organization that works in Kibera to educate young girls and make the school a focus of the community. Rebecca, who plays soccer and hockey, said she liked making time to find donations for the group because the girls she met inspired her. ""I saw how some people are not as lucky as we are,"" she said of that first trip. ""I wanted to help those people."" Laurie Moret, an organizational psychologist, said she came up with the party idea for her daughters after being overwhelmed with presents on Zoe's first birthday. But she said she lets her girls make the ultimate decision on the party. ""If they ever didn't want to do it, we wouldn't do it,"" she said. ""My only hope is community service becomes how brushing their teeth is to them: They do it because it's the right thing to do."" The parent-children combinations that work best tend not to emphasize the amount of money but the help going to others. Jim Coutre, a partner at the Philanthropic Initiative and Olivia's father, said the risk of focusing on the money, particularly with upper-middle-class children, is that it teaches them the wrong lesson about giving. ""What I like to see is parents who are talking to their children in a way that's not about building pity but empathy,"" he said. ""It should be, 'Here are some people that I can help' and not 'Look at what I have, poor them.' ""

Even in his day job, advising wealthy families on philanthropy, he tries to keep the amount of money out of conversations with children. ""It can be distracting,"" he said. ""It can take the focus away from what you're trying to do and really put that focus on your wealth. When they're in their 20s and 30s, it's going to be about the wealth."" The skills required to make decisions around grants -- like learning to lead, seek consensus and analyze different facts and opinions -- are so crucial that several organizations are trying to make sure that affluent children aren't the only ones who can partake. Karen Davis, vice president for community relations at Hasbro, the toymaker, said the company had given $5 million to fund a group that selects ""community action heroes."" ""We want to reach those kids who have been on the receiving end of services,"" Ms. Davis said. ""We want those kids to recognize that they can give back, that they can solve a problem."" Hasbro gives the winners of the prize a $1,000 college scholarship, but the company also promotes the children and what they've done to inspire others. Naturally, the cynical take on all of this do-gooding, particularly for teenagers, is that it will look great on a college application. Scott Rubenstein, 18 of Scottsdale, Ariz., will be a high school senior this fall, and he bristles at the suggestion. He started giving his bar mitzvah money away when he was 13 and has since served on the boards of local and national Jewish charitable organizations, where he has helped award large grants. ""I think that while all of this involvement certainly will look good on a college application, I wouldn't be involved in it just to put it on a college app,"" he said. ""I think that teens like me who are involved like this do it because they really enjoy it. We wouldn't put the time and energy into it if we didn't get something out of it personally.""

And it's hard not to see the educational component of learning about someone different from you. ""For me, involving the kids, it's letting them know what's happening around the world,"" said Kennedy Odede, founder and chief executive of Shining Hope for Communities. ""What I'm offering is a little bit of education that they won't teach you in school or college. I've had kids who were having a bar mitzvah who say 'I don't want that thing; I want to buy tents for kids in Kibera.' "" For the youngest, of course, how their charitable acts will influence their future is a long way off. Zoe Moret, for one, is focused on her birthday party in November. ""I'm going to have this big party,"" she said. ""I'm going to have an all-girl slumber party."" And a cause will again be part of it. ""I might narrow it down to one animal this year, like an endangered species,"" she said. And then after a pause, ""I'll probably stick with lions.""","Encouraged to participate in charitable causes, some children are finding deep satisfaction in sacrificing for the welfare of others.",f7caa0bd-0d5d-56cd-9802-aee1ca986d16,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/05/your-money/05wealth-pic1/05wealth-pic1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=425&w=600&s=6c863ae142a3ca2ca0612b06f666096afb11f7bf654e41c9467e46cfcc01bbc6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Laurie Moret with her daughters, from left: Sophie, Mia and Zoe.",f7caa0bd-0d5d-56cd-9802-aee1ca986d16,N24News/imgs/f7caa0bd-0d5d-56cd-9802-aee1ca986d16.jpg,21
Style,The Glory (and the Taboo) of 'WAP',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/18/style/wap-cardi-b.html,"I was thrilled to listen to and watch ""WAP,"" Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's recently released homage to female sexuality and vaginal, shall we say, lubrication. (I recommend Googling what the acronym stands for, because it's not something The New York Times is often allowed to print.) As a gynecologist, I'm used to dispelling all kinds of vaginal misinformation in the office and online, but the one myth that is the hardest to undo -- and that I encounter regularly with patients -- is the idea that vaginal lubrication is ""problematic."" These women don't have an itch or an odor. They don't have pain with sex. They have no symptom other than their concern about the volume of their vaginal discharge or that they're overly lubricated during sex. Or both. I know the cruelty and damaging messages these women receive from various sources -- men, mothers, friends, magazines and social media -- all because of a system built and maintained (often by those without vaginas) that revolves around the culture of the problematic, shameful and, yes, wet vagina.

Did a partner (usually male, because I never hear this from women whose partners are women) complain about the wet spot? Get grossed out by white secretions on his penis? Say he ""couldn't feel anything""? Blame his lost erection or premature ejaculation on your lubrication? Or perhaps it was the underwear challenge on social media, in which young women posted images of their underwear on social media to brag about their dryness and lack of discharge as a supposed sign of health and cleanliness. The douche recommended by a friend. The swab promoted on Instagram to wipe out the vagina after sex. The repeated articles in women's magazines about the myth of eating pineapple to make oral sex sweeter. (And yes, it's a myth. It's a vagina, not a pina colada.) Concerns about vaginal lubrication aren't just limited to women who express concern about the volume of discharge -- what is ""normal""? 1 to 3 milliliters in 24 hours, which is almost a soaked panty liner -- or their wetness with sexual arousal. If vaginal lubrication were celebrated, then female masturbation wouldn't be taboo, and both women and men would learn in sex education that the increased blood flow to the vaginal tissues allows fluid to leak across the cells, resulting in an additional 3 to 5 milliliters of lubrication. Men and women would also know that needing or liking lubricant isn't a sign of personal failure. Because women are also shamed when they are not wet enough at the exact moment the penis is ready for intercourse.

To be a woman and to partner with men is to constantly walk the edge of the knife between too wet and too dry. Gush on command, but not too much because then you're promiscuous or gross or both. An editor once told me the magazine where she worked needed at least one ""vagina gone bad"" article each week, that the quest for vaginal mayhem consumed editorial meetings. What sells copy is how to fix vaginas ... that men feel are broken. No one ever says that last part out loud. The 'Problematic Vagina' Isn't New -- or American The fear of vaginal wetness crosses cultures and religions and countries and eras. And it's not just seen in direct shaming about lubrication. Every so-called vaginal hygiene measure can trace its lineage to the problematic wet vagina and other misinformation about the reproductive tract. During the time of Hippocrates, and for centuries afterward, women's bodies were considered physically inferior to men. According to this logic, one reason was women were ""wetter"" than men. This was not related to the vagina; rather, women's flesh was considered loose textured and spongy so they absorbed more fluid from their food and became too wet. The proof? Menstrual blood was excess fluid that the female body was unable to process ""normally,"" like men, so the uterus functioned as an overflow valve to make up for shoddy plumbing. Many medical therapies for women of the day revolved around ensuring regular menstruation to prevent the dangerous buildup of fluid as well as keeping the uterus in place as it could wander exerting pressure on organs causing illness. Many treatments were vaginal, often pessaries of herbs, oils or animal fats or fumigation of the uterus.

Today's influencers and alternative medicine aficionados like to exoticize these practices as ancient wisdom, especially fumigation, which is now called vaginal steaming. But this practice would have been ineffective at best and it's unclear in the rush to celebrate this practice as reclaimed lost knowledge if anyone looked at the actual recipes (I'll spare you, but they can be horrific). Most, if not all, of these ancient vaginal therapies would have damaged the vaginal ecosystem -- a concept completely unknown at the time -- leaving dryness or a sensation of dryness as a side effect. It's not a leap to think the concept of vaginal health and dryness became synonymous, especially given a core belief for the teachings that led to Western medicine was women's bodies were too wet. Vaginal wetness, especially during sex, has long been erroneously considered a sign of previous sexual activity, which implies promiscuity. Medical beliefs and practices often conform to society, giving rise to so-called feminine hygiene measures that blurred dryness -- the proxy for chastity -- with health and cleanliness. Almost every single feminine hygiene product will dry the vagina to some degree. So great is the physical damage that many increase the risk of some sexually transmitted infections (S.T.I.s) if exposed. Dryness also reduces sexual enjoyment for women, essentially turning them into receptacles for male pleasure; in fact, dryness can make sex uncomfortable to painful for both partners, but especially the woman. The products used are as diverse and creative as they are pervasive. Some of the more common ones still in use include bleach, vinegar, lemon juice, oak galls, bags of herbs, soap and water, or wiping internally with a cloth. Sometimes the explicit goal is dry sex or tightness; other times the overt connection with sexual purity has been lost, and the purpose is simply unnecessary and harmful maintenance. A quest for something marketers have called freshness. If a woman is wet she may be, according to this misinformation, the wrong kind of wet. An ""unclean"" kind.

It seems that everywhere women turn there is predatory messaging about vaginas, and much of it shares a common mutation: the erroneous belief that vaginas are problematic and the most dangerous vagina of all is wet. Many women around the world learn these practices from their mothers, sisters and girlfriends. In the past six months I've seen two start-ups with so-called empowering but likely medically harmful products to clean vaginas -- both led by women. And Instagram is filled with women selling a variety of unnecessary and damaging vaginal detoxes or promoting accouterments for vaginal steaming. Having women perpetuate the misconception that a so-called clean vagina is a healthy vagina is the ultimate subversion of feminism. The switch in seller from Big Feminine Hygiene (companies that mass produce douches, sprays or wipes) to Little Feminine Hygiene (various start-ups or makers of vaginal detox ""pearls,"" which are bags of herbs to be left in the vagina for several days) is simply another intertwining of culture and medicine to control the vagina at the expense of the health of women. The cultural influence of religion or the importance of sexual purity has now been replaced by the quest for purity through so-called natural products -- conveniently neglecting that the vagina in its natural state is self-cleaning and the mechanism for that is wetness. To say a vagina needs cleaning is perhaps the most unnatural statement of all. So as I watched Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion praise a wet and gushy vagina in a stunning display of confidence -- and not just sexual confidence -- I was thrilled. Not just to see the glory of ""WAP"" celebrated as it should be, but because now I have an actual cultural reference, a public celebration, to use while talking with women.","All praise Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion, whose new song addresses a concern I hear a lot from my patients.",08a54c98-e8dd-5ccd-b76b-8ea091a6f36a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/20/fashion/20cycle-wap-cardi/20cycle-wap-cardi-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=05f31fa2ce693c260cb375c0524be72975bf586ea4e24830571dd2798b7bc301&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion.,08a54c98-e8dd-5ccd-b76b-8ea091a6f36a,N24News/imgs/08a54c98-e8dd-5ccd-b76b-8ea091a6f36a.jpg,15
Science,Decoding Pandas' Come-Hither Calls,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/20/science/panda-bleats.html,"The bleat not only alerts other pandas to the presence of an available mate, it contains important information about the vocalist's size and identity. Given the dense bamboo thicket that limits visual contact in most panda habitats and the brevity of panda mating season -- females ovulate just once a year and can conceive for only a few days -- the pandas' ability to perceive the bleat is critical to reproduction among this once-endangered species.

Now, researchers have determined that the bleat works best as a local call. A panda can discern aspects of a caller's identity. like its size, from a bleat within about 65 feet, but the caller's gender is only perceptible within about 33 feet, according to a study published Thursday in Scientific Reports.

Megan Owen, a conservation ecologist at the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research and an author of the study, offered a human analogy for how this ability works.

""If you're walking into a crowded room and someone calls out your name, there's a certain point where you can identify who that is, or maybe you can identify that it's a male or female that is calling your name,"" she said. ""There's information that's encoded in that call, but that information degrades over distance.""

To conduct the study, Dr. Owen and her colleagues -- including Ben Charlton, another San Diego institute researcher who has studied panda bleats -- obtained recordings of giant pandas from Chengdu, China, during breeding season. They then played those recordings through a speaker in a section of the San Diego Zoo Safari Park that contains bamboo similar in type and density to a typical panda habitat. By placing recording devices throughout the bamboo, the researchers were able to capture and analyze the bleats from various distances.","During mating season, the solitary mammals bleat important information to each other through their dense bamboo habitat.",681fb2b4-4f3b-5848-8b2c-3b72c631f5bb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/25/science/21TB-PANDA/21TB-PANDA-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=17a64999c1d69c0b0c82788af27cd19e3c0641094223ba95a2626f2732da9317&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Bao Bao the panda at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., in 2014.

Travel,How the Concierge Endures in an Internet World,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/16/travel/how-the-concierge-endures-in-an-internet-world.html,"""When you have a problem like this, you can lay down and say smartphones are just taking over the world and give up, or you can step up your game,"" he said.

Mr. McQuade said he thought too many of his colleagues were hung up on sending guests to venues they could walk to or were preordained as tourist-friendly. ""You go to a concierge to find things you couldn't find on your own,"" he said. ""If you're in New York, you're going to know about the Met and the Statue of Liberty. But if I tell them about a good jazz club or a Greenwich Village walking tour or a restaurant in Little Italy, that's something they can only get from me.

""People want to find those secret places. You should look at their itinerary and tell them what they're missing that gives them the essence of the town. The internet isn't doing that -- taking a look at the bigger picture -- and neither are some concierges.""

If guests can find them, that is. According to the American Hotel and Lodging Association, the share of luxury hotels that employ concierges fell to 82 percent from nearly 100 percent between 2014 and 2016, with many concierges taking on duties that require them to abandon their once stationary posts. For instance, Joseph Sundberg of the Hotel Monaco in Portland, Ore., now holds the title of roving concierge, which finds him ferrying luggage, among other chores.

""My job is more like a porter captain,"" he explained. ""I'm more of a jester of the lobby.""

Mr. Sundberg, who has worked in Portland's hotel industry for 31 years, is a microbrew connoisseur in a resolutely sudsy city, and is constantly visiting new haunts to assess their worthiness. It's this physical connection to a place that he feels gives him an edge over what can be gleaned online.

""Everybody thinks they have all the information,"" he said. ""But learning it from a local -- a guy who lives it and continues to live it -- is a far better way. You can go into a great restaurant, but what about going into the bar at that restaurant and telling Matt that Joseph sent you? How much more personable is that?""

But for all the passion and validity of Mr. Sundberg's spiel, the internet isn't going away -- which is fine by Robert Marks. The president of Les Clefs d'Or USA, Mr. Marks has been a concierge for 29 years -- he currently works at the Omni Hotel in San Diego -- and feels he has a crucial role to play in concert with iPhones and Samsungs.","There is plenty of information (and opinion) online.

He's a paid companion who was connected to Mr. Rodger through Papa, a health tech company that provides ""grandkids on demand.""

Before the new coronavirus pandemic, the two spent multiple hours together each week -- running errands, going to dialysis appointments, or just watching movies. Today, their relationship is restricted to phone calls but they remain close. ""The whole situation is so scary,"" said Mr. Figueroa on the phone, from his home. ""So just talking to him is so uplifting."" Likewise, Mr. Rodger said, ""It's good to hear from him!"" The two men are a good match by design. Founded in 2018, Papa pairs older adults with college students and young workers who have common interests and hobbies. Mr. Rodger and Mr. Figueroa are both military veterans who enjoy documentaries, sports and an occasional beer, and they live within a few blocks of each other. But whereas the 5,000 Papa pals once played card games or worked on memoirs with the seniors they have befriended, today they are FaceTiming or calling each other to discuss a world in disarray. Some have shifted to running errands, picking up groceries or prescriptions. For these and other tasks, they make between $11 and $14 an hour, not including tips and covered expenses like gas, on a freelance basis. (Papa is currently available in 20 states; the company typically charges clients $20 to $25 an hour.)

Despite the low wage, this is still vital work. According to a 2018 AARP Foundation survey, roughly one-third of older adults in the United States are socially isolated, a state that is linked to increased health risks, including heart disease, cancer, depression, diabetes and suicide. Vivek Murthy, the former United States surgeon general, has written that loneliness and social isolation are ""associated with a reduction in life span similar to that caused by smoking 15 cigarettes a day."" And the problem has an impact on the health care system. Last year, there were thousands of emergency room visits in Dallas that had nothing to do with physical ailments at all. The patients were just completely socially isolated, without anyone to turn to for help. ""Loneliness is now finally being recognized as a disease, not only at a personal level, but also from a health care perspective,"" said Andrew Parker, 32, who founded Papa in 2018. His company is one of several that aims to be a stopgap, and health insurers who may be looking to cut costs have begun to take notice. Mr. Rodger's family is paying for Papa because of a conundrum: Mr. Rodger's granddaughter Tanya Martin had been his primary caretaker for more than four years. But once Mr. Rodger needed dialysis, it became too much for her to handle with her full-time job as an airplane mechanic. He didn't qualify to have further assistance covered by his health insurance, but he also couldn't afford a private caretaker, which can cost about $300 a day in Los Angeles, according to the prices Ms. Martin was quoted.

It's a very tough time to be one of the 1.5 million Americans who currently live in nursing homes. About one-fifth of U.S. virus deaths are linked to nursing facilities, and employees, who are often poorly paid and have multiple jobs, are overtaxed and afraid for their own families. Visitors have been banned, heightening the atmosphere of fear and isolation. Even before the pandemic, caregivers and aides were often overtaxed, tasked with helping many other residents and with little time to socialize. Emotional support can be hard to come by. ""There's no real meaningful conversation,"" said Liz Barlowe, the president of the Aging Life Care Association, a nonprofit representing senior care professionals. ""There is that lack of connectedness, of being present and hyper-focused on one person.""

So Mon Ami, another company that facilitates senior companion services through nursing homes and for individuals, recently set up a volunteer phone bank to support older people isolated by shelter-in-place orders. It drew 300 hundred volunteers within days. (The company's founders, Madeline Dangerfield-Cha, 32, and Joy Zhang, 31, said that Mon Ami's paid companions have also shifted to phone calls or virtual visits, staying in touch with seniors by putting on mini concerts, reading books aloud and instructing gentle movement exercises.) One of those volunteers is Morgan Steele, 25, a clinical research coordinator at Stanford University. She was recently paired with Hugh Ping, 77, with whom she chats several times a week. Mon Ami suggests that companions and clients chat for 15 to 30 minutes at a time, ""but we can talk well over half an hour without even realizing it,"" Ms. Steele said. Mr. Ping's daughter, Deanna Ping, said it has been challenging to strip her sociable father from the small interactions that were ""very major to him"": He loved venturing out from his home in the Bay Area to go to the drugstore and to restaurants where he knew all the staff. ""It brings me a lot of peace to know there are others to talk with him,"" she said. Often, in conversation with Ms. Steele, Mr. Ping compares the current situation to having lived through the Cuban missile crisis when he was in the Air Force. ""He talks about a time where people didn't know if their whole world was ending,"" Ms. Steele said. It helps keep things in perspective. ""We think we have it bad when we're working from home with our significant other or roommates, but then you start to realize there are people who are literally so alone,"" Ms. Steele said. ""A half-hour call can really brighten their day.""

For paid companion positions, both Papa and Mon Ami screen potential candidates through in-depth interviews, as well as through background and motor vehicle checks. (The volunteer bank is far less intensively screened, though still requires an application.) While a majority of companions have relevant experience -- as nurses, social workers or medical school students -- Ms. Zhang said Mon Ami looks for those who possess social and emotional intelligence skills, those who ""can be present and can engage with someone who is very different from you."" It's an appealing gig for students with flexible schedules or for those who now find themselves with time on their hands. (Mon Ami companions work an average of four hours per week.) But the benefits go both ways. The start-up routinely hears that the work does as much for their emotional well-being of many of companions as it may do for the seniors. Ms. Dangerfield-Cha is clear that Mon Ami is but one option in an industry suffering from a senior care shortage. About 10,000 people turn 65 each day, and 43 percent envision aging in their primary home. Estimates from the Census Bureau indicate that Americans over the age of 65 will comprise nearly 20 percent of the total population by 2030. ""The reality is that as our society is aging more rapidly than at any other time in history, we need all types of support,"" Ms. Dangerfield-Cha said. ""We're going to need all of it -- and then some."" To that point, AARP data shows that those who are socially isolated cost an additional $6.7 billion in Medicare spending; Papa already works with 10 health plans, including Humana, Aetna and Florida Blue, and the company is pursuing more partnerships, including offering the service to new parents and other caregivers. It has raised $12.6 million in venture funding to date.

As it expands, Papa is also working to safeguard its continuing companionships, like that of Mr. Figueroa and Mr. Rodger. Not that the two need much oversight. They already have big plans once the world reverts to normal. ""I want to get into golfing now, thanks to him,"" Mr. Figueroa said of Mr. Rodger. ""As soon as we're clear to go out, we're definitely going to get out there in the field."" Mr. Rodger, excited by the prospect of a day on the putting green, couldn't contain his enthusiasm -- or his grandfatherly tendencies. ""I have some pointers,"" he said. ""I could help you.""","Combating loneliness is vital work.

Media,Turmoil Continues at Pandora Media as Its Chief Executive Resigns,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/business/media/pandora-ceo.html,"The internet radio pioneer would operate a ticketing company and integrate concert listings with its music streams. It developed an on-demand subscription service to go head-to-head with Spotify and Apple, and had plans to expand internationally. To lead the charge, the company brought back Tim Westergren, its charismatic co-founder, as chief executive. But on Tuesday, Mr. Westergren left the company after only 15 months at the helm, and over the last few weeks many of the company's boldest plans have been jettisoned or cast into doubt. To raise needed cash, Pandora unloaded Ticketfly, its ticketing service, at a significant loss, and accepted a $480 million investment from Sirius XM, giving that company a 19 percent stake and three board seats, including the chairmanship. Roger Faxon, a Pandora board member, said in a statement that the recent moves were meant to ""refocus and reinforce"" the company, and that Pandora was still committed to its new subscription platforms.

Yet as many analysts see it, Mr. Westergren's departure was an inevitable result of the investment from Sirius XM, the satellite radio giant controlled by Liberty Media. Executives at those companies, particularly Gregory B. Maffei, Liberty's chief, have made it clear that they admire Pandora's core advertising business but have little interest in the rest. ""This is the door being opened wide for the Liberty-Sirius XM team to come in with a new agenda for Pandora,"" said Barton Crockett, a media analyst with FBR Capital Markets. In its announcement on Tuesday, Pandora said that Naveen Chopra, its chief financial officer, would be interim chief executive while the company searches for a new leader, and that Jason Hirschhorn, a former executive at Myspace and MTV Networks who runs a popular news aggregator, had joined the board. Shares in Pandora were flat on Tuesday, rising only 3 cents to close at $8.49. On Monday, they had jumped 2 percent after the technology news site Recode reported Sunday night that Mr. Westergren was preparing to leave. The exit of Mr. Westergren, a former musician who has been internet radio's most enthusiastic evangelist, is the most dramatic development in a tumultuous year for the company, full of management departures, a falling stock price and continual pressure from Wall Street to sell.

Mr. Westergren, who also left his position on the board, did not respond to messages seeking comment. But in a statement issued by Pandora, he said he was ""incredibly proud of the company we have built."" ""We invented a whole new way of enjoying and discovering music,"" Mr. Westergren added, ""and in doing so, forever changed the listening experience for millions."" Mr. Westergren was one of the founders of the company in 2000, when it was called Savage Beast Technologies and sold music recommendation services to businesses like Best Buy. He was chief executive of Savage Beast from 2002 to 2004. Renamed Pandora Media in 2005, the company became by far the most popular internet radio service, using a proprietary music genome technology that analyzed the characteristics of songs its users liked, and fed them others like it.
* Stocks rise after President Biden says Jerome Powell will stay atop the Fed.
* Retail earnings and Black Friday: the week in business. One of the few digital music brands to become a household name, Pandora amassed 80 million regular users and built a substantial advertising business, generating more than $1 billion in sales last year. But the company antagonized the music industry along the way, and was slow to adapt to the challenges posed by Spotify and Apple. After taking over as chief executive in March 2016, Mr. Westergren tried to remake the service, striking licensing deals with record companies for a new subscription service, Pandora Premium, that let users listen to any song for $10 a month.

Investors were skeptical of those plans, and worried about all the cash Pandora was burning through. In the third quarter of last year, for example, Pandora's new music deals contributed to a $93 million jump in its licensing costs, and by the end of 2016, the company logged a $343 million net loss, double its loss from the year before, according to filings. The sale of Ticketfly was another bruising experience. Pandora bought the company, a fast-growing ticket provider for clubs and theaters, in late 2015 for $335 million, and this month sold it to Eventbrite, another ticketing start-up, for just $200 million. When he took over last year, Mr. Westergren said repeatedly that Pandora was not for sale, despite strong pressure from activist investors and a sagging stock price; since the beginning of the year, its shares are down by a third. But a deal of some kind seemed inevitable. Since Sirius XM's investment was announced on June 9, Pandora's board has faced a conflict between Mr. Westergren's expansive plans for the company and the wishes of its incoming directors. Recruiting a strong new chief executive would have been problematic with Mr. Westergren still on the board. ""Tim stepped in to be C.E.O. at a critical time for the company,"" Timothy J. Leiweke, another board member, said in a statement, ""and was quickly able to reset relations with the major labels, launch our on-demand service, reconstitute the management team and refortify our balance sheet by securing an investment from Sirius XM."" Over the last year, there has been continual turnover among Pandora's executive ranks. Sara Clemens, the chief operating officer and a driving force behind its acquisition strategy, resigned in December. In April, just weeks after the company released Pandora Premium, its chief technology officer left.","Tim Westergren, a co-founder of the internet radio pioneer, is leaving as the struggling company as it accepts a $480 million investment from Sirius XM.",dfdfbe4d-9acd-5d2b-a66d-4612dc6b5766,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/28/business/28PANDORA1/28PANDORA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=f2d023204bbf697b370b775996a005a1a4984ebe8dc3449975802c6c061d414c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Tim Westergren, a founder of Pandora, is leaving the company 15 months after he took over as chief executive.",dfdfbe4d-9acd-5d2b-a66d-4612dc6b5766,N24News/imgs/dfdfbe4d-9acd-5d2b-a66d-4612dc6b5766.jpg,16
Automobiles,"Wright's New York Showroom, Now Just a Memory",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/automobiles/wrights-new-york-showroom-now-just-a-memory.html,"A small landmark of New York City architectural and automotive history disappeared recently, almost without notice. The theatrical auto showroom designed by Frank Lloyd Wright at 430 Park Avenue, at 56th Street, had displayed a number of European brands over the years, notably Mercedes-Benz from 1957 to 2012. The space, with a spiral ramp and turntable interior, was designed in 1954 for the pioneering auto importer Max Hoffman. In early April, the Wright interior was demolished by the owners of the building, Midwood Investment and Management and Oestreicher Properties. Debra Pickrel, a preservationist and co-author of ""Frank Lloyd Wright in New York: The Plaza Years, 1954-1959"" (Gibbs Smith, 2007) wrote about the showroom's destruction in Metropolis magazine. Born in Austria, Maximilian Hoffman immigrated to New York with the outbreak of World War II. In 1947, he established a firm to import little-known European brands to New York and the West Coast.

Hoffman first intended the showroom for Jaguars. Drawings from the Wright archives show a leaping Jaguar sculpture and planters. But by the time the showroom was completed, Jaguar had set up its own sales space. Instead, the Hoffman space was filled with a mix of cars, including Porsches, for which he was the official importer to the United States. The first drawings for the showroom have pedestrians on Park Avenue looking into the space. A rotating turntable held three or four cars; a ramp behind it accommodated one or two more. That spiral anticipated the design of the Guggenheim Museum, which opened in 1959. Frank Lloyd Wright's sketch of the Hoffman automobile showroom at 430 Park Ave. The Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation Archives (The Museum of Modern Art | Avery Architectural & Fine Arts Library, Columbia University, New York) The showroom was never considered a major work. In 1966, the architecture critic of The New York Times, Ada Louise Huxtable, who died in January, referred to it as ""cramped."" But it was one of a handful of Wright buildings in the New York area, and its form has a definite place in key themes of Wright's work, according to historians like David G. DeLong, professor emeritus of architecture at the University of Pennsylvania.

Part of Wright's fee for the design work was two Mercedes-Benzes, according to Douglas Steiner, who has written extensively about the architect. Wright also designed a house for Hoffman in Rye, N.Y. Almost alone, it seems, Mr. Hoffman saw a market for European luxury models in New York and Beverly Hills. Beginning in the late 1940s, he imported a wide range of brands, including Delahaye and Austin. He was willing to take a chance on the former Third Reich's people's car, the Volkswagen, which eventually became a huge hit. He also offered the Jowett Jupiter, which was not. Hoffman met Ferry Porsche, son of the company's founder, in 1950 and began importing Porsches to New York. He often raced cars himself to publicize the brands. Hoffman was known for coming up with ideas for new models that would sell well in the United States, suggesting the series production of the Mercedes 300SL Gullwing and the Porsche Speedster to their respective manufacturers. In 1958, Mercedes-Benz bought out Hoffman and remained in the Park Avenue space, through two renovations, until decamping last year for a larger showroom in a new dealership on Eleventh Avenue. To students of Wright's work, the showroom ramps recall larger designs. One was the never-built Gordon Strong Automobile Objective, a mountaintop tower imagined in 1924 for a wealthy client. It was to be a structure where cars would park at the culmination of a scenic drive in Maryland. The other is the Guggenheim Museum, which resembles the Automobile Objective tower flipped on its head.

""We have a network of members and professionals who informally monitor Wright buildings in their regions and in the media, and we often learn about situations through these 'Wright watch' participants,"" she said. ""They constitute a kind of early-warning system for risks to Wright buildings. We sent a formal request for evaluation to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in August 2012."" According to Matt Chaban of Crain's New York Business, who reported on the events, on March 22 the commission called, and on March 25 sent a letter, informing the building owner that landmarking was under discussion. On March 28, the owner applied to the city Buildings Department, a separate agency, for a demolition permit, which was granted. Demolition took place the next week. ""The Landmarks Commission was unaware that the space had been demolished until we had an eyewitness report that the space had been gutted,"" Ms. Halstead said. Calls and e-mails to the owners, Midwood Investment and Management and Oestreicher Properties, and to the building's managers, were not returned. The conservancy's president, Larry Woodin, issued a statement reading in part, ""It is very disappointing that the City of New York was not able to move quickly enough to prevent the demolition of this Wright space."" Donna Boland, a spokeswoman for Mercedes-Benz, said the hope when Mercedes left was that the showroom would be leased to another car company. ""We were shocked at the removal,"" she said, ""but had no say in it since we leased the space.""","The auto showroom designed by Frank Lloyd Wright at 430 Park Avenue, which had displayed a number of European brands over the years, has been torn down.",9401feaf-818c-56d5-8ec9-724950bc7442,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/23/automobiles/Wright1/Wright1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=307&w=600&s=cc70cafe8341c4c66a97ac8634e4078f58f051d7d10a938917ce1f847b28b800&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"IN THE ROUND In 1955, new Porsches were displayed on the spiral ramp of the Park Avenue showroom designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.",9401feaf-818c-56d5-8ec9-724950bc7442,N24News/imgs/9401feaf-818c-56d5-8ec9-724950bc7442.jpg,23

Automobiles,Some Handles Go Into Hiding; Others Make Grand Entrance,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/automobiles/03HANDLES.html,"SPACESUITS have no buttons and space stations have no door knobs. Automobiles, which sometimes aspire to be spaceships, seem to want to lose their old-fashioned door handles.

Decades ago, car customizers like George Barris banished handles, sometimes replacing them with hidden electric releases. Auto designers tended to devise flush, sleek handles that were as discreet as possible. These, along with such impractical features as gullwing doors and tiny (or absent) side mirrors, have long been staples of the concept cars at auto shows.

I once asked Peter Horbury, who is now the design director for Volvo, about this. Designers, he explained, operate on the assumption that in the future doors will just magically open. They, too, have been watching ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Wars.""

Until thought-actuated operation becomes feasible, the designers are hiding the means of access. Cadillac has devoted a whole advertisement to this feature: ""The door handles are invisible"" the company brags in an ad for the CTS-V performance coupe. That detail suggests the purity of the car's design, the ad suggests.

Real Estate,Just the Right Amount of Space in Williamsburg,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/realestate/just-the-right-amount-of-space-in-williamsburg.html,"Besides, Williamsburg was changing so rapidly that street pictures were quickly outdated.

Mr. Buchanan encountered a one-bedroom for rent in a South Williamsburg condo building, Williamsberry, on Berry Street, but was deterred by its location, near the base of the Williamsburg Bridge.

He liked a new rental building, 456 Grand in East Williamsburg, but the smallest apartment available was a one-bedroom for a bit more than $3,000. ""This one-bedroom was way bigger than I needed,"" he said. ""I couldn't really justify the price. That might sound like a couple of extra hundred bucks, but that stuff adds up.""

He contacted the Ice Cream Factory, a 23-unit rental building on Berry Street that opened over the summer, and heard from Charles Fontana Machado, a salesman at Citi Habitats and a leasing agent there. Mr. Buchanan was unaware of the building's location near the Williamsburg Bridge, just across the street from Williamsberry. But the location was moot -- the building's four studios had long since been rented, and the last one-bedroom had just been rented, too.

Mr. Machado, however, offered to line up some similar options.

By now, Mr. Buchanan knew that a one-bedroom was unnecessary. In his Arlington apartment, which rented for $2,100, ""I was always in my bedroom,"" he said. ""I would never go out to my living room."" He knew that New Yorkers managed in one-bedrooms with spouses and children. ""I see other people -- all I need is a studio.""

So he declined a $3,000 one-bedroom for rent in a small, boutique condominium with no amenities.

Mr. Machado also suggested the 82-unit Williams on South Fifth Street, a new building not unlike the Ice Cream Factory but bigger and with more amenities.

Science,"We Tried 5 Cold-Weather Experiments. Instant Slushies, Frozen Bubbles and More.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/science/polar-vortex-experiments.html,"We Tried 5 Cold-Weather Experiments . Instant Slushies, Frozen Bubbles and More.

For the latest developments, read our cold weather live briefing. EVANSTON, Ill. -- It was minus 15 degrees here on Wednesday afternoon, near the epicenter of the polar vortex, and school had been canceled for much of the week. ""How are we going to survive?"" one mother asked on a text thread Tuesday night. My phone pinged at 9 a.m. Wednesday with a plaintive message from someone else: ""We've already gone through my two craft projects, painted and watched an hour of TV."" At times like these, modern parents turn to Google and YouTube and Pinterest, which beckon with seemingly simple and fun science experiments for frigid temperatures. But as my 7-year-old son, Gus, and his friend Eren, 8, learned on Wednesday when we tested a handful of popular cold-weather experiments, science doesn't always follow the neat path of a viral video.

We shook up two one-liter bottles of Sprite and placed them outside of our front door, where my phone told me it was minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit. We also put a small bottle of spring water alongside them to test the instant-ice trick. The idea was to try to cool the soda and the water below their freezing point without turning them solid. Without the impurities found in tap water, there is nothing to start the nucleation process that causes water to freeze, delivering a supercooled liquid that, once jostled or disturbed, will instantly turn to a slushy ice. But two hours later, the bottles outside our house were already halfway solid. Eren, Gus and my 3-year-old daughter, Hildy, didn't seem to care as they slurped down cups of the stuff.

""What did we learn today?"" my husband, Alex, said. ""The internet is broken."" Olivia Castellini, a senior exhibit developer at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, offered several other possible explanations. Our spring water might not have been pure enough, and we may have waited too long. Next time, she recommended timing how long it took to freeze one bottle, then putting out another bottle and returning about 15 minutes earlier to catch the liquid at exactly the moment. ""You have to find just the right amount of time to super cool it,"" Dr. Castellini said.

This experiment is designed to show how the volume of a gas expands as it warms, and contracts as it cools. The method: Blow up balloons in warm air, then expose them to cold air and they will deflate. They will reinflate when you return them to warm air. This is the same reason car tires deflate in cold weather, said Michael Kennedy, a research professor and director of Northwestern University's Science in Society, a science education center. We inflated half a dozen balloons inside, then bundled up and went outside to wait for them to shrink in the minus 39 degree windchill. And we waited. Gus and Eren decided to bury their balloons in a snow bank. Hildy's flew into the street. When we could no longer feel our noses, we put the remaining balloons in a bag, tied it to the door handle, and rushed inside. After about 45 minutes, the balloons had deflated only slightly and we realized we hadn't been very scientific: It might have been wise to first measure the balloons' original circumference, for example. Alex, the lab assistant, prepared the balloon experiment for the scientists. Danielle Scruggs for The New York Times Once back inside, the balloons did return to their previous shape, but by this time only the adults cared. The child scientists wanted more Sprite slushies.

Dr. Castellini recommended tying a string around the balloons, placing them outside, in a window, where you can watch them from the comfort of your home. When the string falls off, they've shrunk. Of all the cold-weather experiments, the one I was most looking forward to was the frozen-bubble trick. The online videos are magical, demonstrating how a normally ethereal soap bubble hardens into a lacy globe when the temperature is just right.

We tried two versions of bubble wands -- a more traditional wand with a small, round opening, and a large, oblong variety designed for bigger bubbles. Once outside, both wands created perfect bubbles, but it was hard to get a look at them because the wind whipped them down the street. Still, it was fun to watch them pop as they flew out of the wands, leaving frozen skins that dropped to the ground. If we waited too long, the bubble solution froze in the wand, creating a translucent pane that we could poke with our fingers. Bubbles, Dr. Castellini said, are really a ""water and soap sandwich,"" with soap encasing a layer of water. In warmer weather, the air inside the bubble expands as it warms, popping the bubble before it gets far. But in cold weather, the water sandwiched inside the soap has a chance to freeze before the bubble pops. Dr. Kennedy suggested experimenting with different solutions to create the longest-lasting bubbles. Many people add glycerin, which gives the bubble strength, he said.

This trick resurfaces during nearly every cold snap, along with the inevitable safety warnings (to riff off Jim Croce, don't throw it into the wind). ""The cool thing about water is that it can exist in liquid, solid and gas states all at the same time,"" Dr. Castellini said. By throwing boiling water into frigid air, she said, ""you're manipulating that transition."" Because cold air can't absorb water the way warm air can, the water that is thrown has to go somewhere -- so it freezes in tiny droplets and falls to the ground in a dramatic cloud. The experiment works best with extremely cold air, and we certainly had that on Wednesday. We repeated the experiment four times -- throwing about a half of a cup of boiling water out of a steel travel mug -- and each time, the water dissipated in a billowing puff of ice crystals. Given the demand for Sprite slushies, I had saved our other sugar-laden experiment for last. Several websites describe a simple recipe for maple syrup taffy. Pack snow into a pan and place it in the freezer. Heat maple syrup to about 240 degrees Fahrenheit, checking with a candy thermometer. Pour the syrup over the snow, where it will harden into a chewy taffy. The hypothesis: That pouring boiling maple syrup on cold, cold snow would make taffy. Danielle Scruggs for The New York Times Our syrup boiled over when it reached about 220 degrees, preventing us from heating it to the right temperature. By now, the children had ripped their blankets from their beds, fashioned them into capes, and were begging for iPad time. I poured the syrup over the snow, and the hot liquid turned everything into a slushy mess. No taffy in sight.

Use a larger pot next time, our science consultants suggested, and cook the syrup more slowly. There's still time to try again, I suppose. The high on Thursday is expected to be just slightly warmer, at minus 1 degree, and school is still canceled. Not all experiments turn out as planned. ""But that's really the fun of science, is that you didn't get the results you expect,"" Dr. Kennedy said. ""You start asking questions about why didn't I get what I thought?"" ""At the heart of science are questions,"" he said, ""not facts.""","With schools closed and temperatures well below zero, one family learned some hard lessons about the scientific process.",787856a7-9435-5527-840e-5d25d1a8fd9e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/01/science/01FREEZE3/01FREEZE3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=995471afbebbf2da9d4a1dd89775cb8b92eac64db575fcfe51aa8b8e46c27af4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Near Chicago, where the temperature reached a high of minus 10 degrees on Wednesday, reporter Katie Thomas pursued a few scientific inquiries.

Opinion,The Hong Kong Government's View,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/opinion/letters/hong-kong-coronavirus.html,"The recent arrests of people for taking part in unauthorized assemblies last year have nothing to do with Covid-19 as suggested in your article but everything to do with upholding the rule of law.

Sports,"With Women's Hockey in Flux, League Says It Will Play in 2021",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/sports/hockey/nwhl-postpone-season.html,"The National Women's Hockey League announced plans on Wednesday to postpone the start of its season from November to January, becoming one of the first North American professional leagues to move its schedule to 2021 because of the pandemic.

According to Anya Packer, director of the N.W.H.L. Players Association, the decision was reached by the league's safety committee weeks ago. That panel of about 20 members includes infectious disease experts, league executives and members of the players' association who have had calls every two weeks since the committee's formation in April.

The league said it would make decisions about medical protocols, ticketing and arena capacity for fans before the start of the season. ""Our decisions are directed by science and driven entirely by safety,"" Michelle Picard, the league's deputy commissioner, said in an email. ""In a pandemic, you're not thinking about being opportunistic as a business. We're doing what's best for the players, staff, fans, media, and everyone in the communities where we play our games.""

This was to be a year of expansion for the league, which added a Toronto franchise in April.

Health,"UnitedHealth Loses Case to the Health Venture Begun by Amazon, Berkshire-Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/health/amazon-berkshire-hathaway-jpmorgan-health.html,"UnitedHealth's main argument was that the venture formed by Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase was a competitor.

UnitedHealth Group, the giant health insurance company, on Friday lost its case to prevent a former executive from working at the new health care venture formed by three powerful corporations, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase. A federal judge in Boston denied UnitedHealth's request to have the executive, David William Smith, immediately stop working. Mr. Smith was an executive at Optum, a unit of UnitedHealth, and it accused him of taking corporate secrets to what it claimed was a competitor. Mr. Smith has denied any wrongdoing. In its court filings, UnitedHealth argued that Mr. Smith's role at Optum made him privy to sensitive information about its plans. Among Optum's businesses is one of the nation's largest pharmacy benefit managers, which serve as intermediaries between drug makers and employers that purchase medicine for their workers. The industry has been sharply criticized for a lack of transparency in how pharmacy benefits managers operate, and Optum's two main rivals recently merged with two large insurers, Aetna and Cigna.

While Judge Mark L. Wolf ruled against it, Optum emphasized that the issues remain unresolved and would need to be settled in arbitration. ""We are committed to protecting our confidential information and will aggressively do so in arbitration,"" said Matt Stearns, a spokesman for Optum, in an emailed statement. A spokeswoman for the new venture, referred to as ""A.B.C."" or ""A.B.J."" in court papers, declined to comment. Unlike court proceedings, the arbitration sessions would not be public. The case against the nascent venture has highlighted the anxiety of established insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers over newcomers to their territory. From start-ups to giant technology firms, the new rivals threaten to unseat companies, like UnitedHealth, that have traditionally dominated these markets. Amazon, which has made tentative forays into the pharmacy business, has emerged as a particularly worrisome competitor. The legal wrangling, which included testimony unsealed by the judge earlier this week, also revealed new details about the powerful triumvirate's plans. While the companies have said that the new venture was not created to generate profits, they have been cryptic about exactly what changes they could make to lower costs and improve the quality of care for their employees. The company made headlines last summer with its choice of chief executive, Dr. Atul Gawande, a high-profile physician who writes for The New Yorker. The court proceedings also underscored just how unhappy customers -- particularly these three employers -- are with the status quo.

""We've been asked to solve a very big problem, which is to figure out new ways of health care,"" John C. Stoddard, a senior executive for the new venture, testified. The three employers combined are spending about $4 billion a year on the roughly one million people they cover. But employees ""have a poor experience,"" Mr. Stoddard said. ""They're not getting the care they need, and the costs continue to rise,"" he said. ""We wouldn't exist unless there was a need to come up with and find a new solution to the problem."" The venture, which has no name and fewer than 20 employees, plans to tackle several areas, including how benefits are provided through traditional health insurance plans, Mr. Stoddard said. High deductibles, which force employees to pay for significant amounts of their care before their insurance kicks in, are a hardship for ""fulfillment-center workers and call-center workers,"" he said. The companies also want to see if they can lower the cost of drugs for chronic conditions. In his testimony, Mr. Stoddard insisted that the new venture had no plans to enter the pharmacy business but wanted to better understand the process and the actual cost of drugs. ""That doesn't make us a competitor,"" he said. ""That makes us a very informed customer."" The employers also want to make it easier for workers to see a doctor, Mr. Stoddard testified. Because Optum also operates a large network of primary-care doctors, the venture might want to work with Optum to provide employees with easier access to physicians. ""That's why this is so crazy to me: that they think of us as competitors, when I see us as potential partners,"" Mr. Stoddard said.",A court battle over trade secrets highlighted how the Big Three corporations' new unit is unnerving major insurers in the field.,c2b383f2-c305-5708-b32b-4e18e666f0c4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/23/science/23OPTUM-print/22OPTUM-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=8d3bdb4dcb202ab5429000673d66a9a949e2311669241eff6ccdcd54b5785742&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"UnitedHealth&rsquo;s main argument was that the venture formed by Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase was a competitor.",c2b383f2-c305-5708-b32b-4e18e666f0c4,N24News/imgs/c2b383f2-c305-5708-b32b-4e18e666f0c4.jpg,1
Movies,'Storm Over Brooklyn' Review: A Flash Point of Racial Violence,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/12/movies/yusuf-hawkins-storm-over-brooklyn-review.html,"On Aug. 23, 1989, a Black teenager named Yusuf K. Hawkins was fatally shot in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, after being surrounded by a group of white youths, an incident of race-related violence that became a lightning rod in New York and beyond. In the wake of George Floyd protests, the documentary ""Yusuf Hawkins: Storm Over Brooklyn"" could scarcely be timelier.

Part of the director Muta'Ali's strategy is to center Hawkins's friends and family, whose stories got lost in the political din. The Rev. Al Sharpton organized marches; for the mayoral candidates in the 1989 primary, the killing became a talking point. But the competing agendas surrounding the case would prevent anyone from making a cohesive Hawkins documentary, and ""Storm Over Brooklyn"" never settles on a satisfying point of view.",This documentary on the race-related killing of the Black teenager Yusuf Hawkins in 1989 never settles on a satisfying point of view.,8f7825e1-ac40-50cb-8362-4021f45c4e41,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/11/arts/yusuf1/yusuf1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=43507ca86ab4825e9b24ff71988d3369e7adfbd48d851f05e5949bdc95a045eb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Yusuf Hawkins, the subject of the documentary ""Storm Over Brooklyn.""",8f7825e1-ac40-50cb-8362-4021f45c4e41,N24News/imgs/8f7825e1-ac40-50cb-8362-4021f45c4e41.jpg,5
Fashion & Style,"Tom Ford, Where the Rich and Famous Go to Look Rich and Famous",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/fashion/tom-ford-store.html,"Behind a kidney-shaped black desk with an expensive floral arrangement, a blond concierge with a ready smile waits to wish you a good afternoon. You are on Madison Avenue and 61st Street, a prime location and expensive real estate, so you may be entering a high-end hotel or an architecture firm, but in fact this is Tom Ford, a master of opulent ambience if ever there was one, for whom black tie is the best tie and no courtesy need be scrapped. That this level of formality is hardly matched by the clientele milling about on a recent Saturday afternoon, almost without exception in gym clothes or flip-flops, is of no import. Mr. Ford, a fashion lifer with past lives at Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci, where he helped pioneer provocation as a contemporary fashion idiom, believes in setting a mood, thickly applied. (Every perfume ad worth its oud hints at sex; Mr. Ford famously wedged a bottle between a female model's naked breasts and a male model's buttocks, the implicit made explicit.) His store staff wears three-piece suits, his lights are dim and suggestive. ""Welcome, sir,"" the whole setup purrs. ""Your dressing room will see you now."" It is a heady invitation. Mr. Ford's store, relocated from several blocks farther up Madison Avenue, is a pleasure dome of glass, chrome and thick-ply carpeting. All along the avenue, new store concepts are being piloted by Mr. Ford's competitors in the luxury market: To the south, there is the store-as-art-gallery (the new Calvin Klein shop, painted Big Bird yellow and scattered with objets by the artist Sterling Ruby); to the north, store-as-avant-garde-office-park (the evocatively drab new Balenciaga). Mr. Ford doesn't budge.

The new space may be a bit lighter and less heavily masculine than Mr. Ford's previous store, which was designed before he had introduced his women's collection, but it is well within Mr. Ford's style -- oligarch's pied-a-terre -- with its marble accents and shagreen end tables. ""Does it look expensive?"" Mr. Ford asked an interviewer from Women's Wear Daily earlier this summer, and was duly reassured. ""Oh, good,"" he said. ""I love that."" On the first floor is the women's collection. The heels are high, the dresses sequined. In a glass vitrine center stage, a lamb coat is laid out full length like a trophy, which, for a particular customer, it is. There is an apartment feel to the store's warren of small rooms, which open onto one another.

In the back, makeup, fragrance and eyewear get a bright, mirrored cove; up front, a more subdued room features a few of the most exotic, costly handbags displayed like artifacts. Mr. Ford's wares have long charmed the rich and famous. The N.B.A. player Dahntay Jones, a guard most recently with the Cavaliers, and his pregnant wife, Valeisha, were being squired around by a black-clad attendant offering assistance. ""You're going to need a push gift,"" she cooed. Up the spiral staircase, a glossy corkscrew of black fiberglass, is the men's department, where the real action is. Mr. Ford is known for red-carpet women's wear (those sequined dresses are major sellers), but his is the unusual luxury brand at which men's wear outsells women's. (Mr. and Mrs. Jones had soon repaired upward to assess men's backpacks and leather goods.)

The men's floor is brighter and more spacious than the women's, and divided between sportswear and suiting, a shoe room tucked in the back. Mr. Ford's sportswear is of the unadventurously correct, adventurously priced variety: to gussy up your just-so stonewashed jeans ($680), try a suede bomber jacket with shearling collar ($6,990). In formal wear, Mr. Ford stretches further, offering velvet and psychedelic jacquard. But it wouldn't be a correct Tom Ford visit without a suit, the four-figure indulgence that sets a certain kind of power broker's eyes agleam. Here, too, Mr. Ford has his preferences. Overruling his taste for a rakish peak lapel requires a trip to the custom salon; in made-to-measure, the customer is king, but on the sales floor Mr. Ford is boss, and the boss prefers peak. So be it. Soon I was encased in the O'Connor, Mr. Ford's most popular suit style -- it has a slimmer profile and a shorter jacket than his Windsor cut -- in a royalish shade of navy that Anthony Butler, a dapper young salesman, assured me ""photographs beautifully."" It was reassuring, though it hadn't been my first thought. But could it be that at Tom Ford, every man is a celebrity, and every carpet red? The O'Connor is Mr. Ford's entry-level model -- $3,960. (This for a two-piece suit; a three-piece version, with waistcoat, climbs to $5,440.) The ethics of such expenditure are beyond the scope of your Critical Shopper. Suffice it to say, for those who have their own spiral staircases in glossy black fiberglass, the leap may not amount to much. Did it look expensive? It did. What's more, it seemed to come with its own gravity. Mr. Ford's shirt collar stood higher and taller than almost any I have worn, and, in his suit, I walked taller. (A trick of the make, Mr. Butler whispered: Mr. Ford's jackets are canvassed -- that is to say, constructed internally -- more staunchly than most. They have, in effect, posture built in.) I did not have the means or the wherewithal to lay down my Amex. But for a few minutes, I was a Ford man, peer of the rich and fabulous, literally keeping up with the Joneses. Dress for the job you want, the saying goes. May I introduce you to me, the newest Cleveland Cavalier?","Other retailers experiment, but this designer has found a style that works for him: unapologetically expensive.",37ae92a5-ad90-5370-853c-e20df822a8e3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/16/fashion/16CRITIC-web2/16CRITIC-web2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=75c37f9b8f3b168a89fc4668cc7d17693076331e2c68e66ae81a40a87b60a3f0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"At Tom Ford the style is oligarch's pied-à-terre.

Art & Design,What to See Right Now in New York Art Galleries,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/arts/design/new-york-art-galleries.html,"'Artist in Exile: The Visual Diary of Baroness Hyde de Neuville' In 1805, the Baroness Hyde de Neuville (1771-1849) chased Napoleon Bonaparte's army across Europe in order to obtain a pardon for her husband, an aristocrat accused of conspiring to assassinate the arriviste French emperor. Her plea succeeded, the Neuvilles were banished to America, and so starts the story of ""Artist in Exile: The Visual Diary of Baroness Hyde de Neuville"" at the New-York Historical Society. Born in Sancerre, France, Neuville was a self-taught artist, which means she learned primarily from books and illustrations, since women of her era weren't allowed to draw from live models. She was a quick study though, and the swift arc of her proficiency is obvious in this exhibition of over 110 watercolors and drawings.

Neuville owned a portable watercolor paint box, a new contraption during that period, and she used it to document landscapes and people, flora and fauna, factories and mansions throughout the Eastern Seaboard and New York State. ""Study of a Tree Trunk with Lichens and Fungi,"" from 1807 to 1814, looks almost abstract and modern, while a ""Corner of Greenwich Street"" (1810) captures the spot where the World Trade Center would later stand. And ""Entrance Gate to the White House Garden with Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, D.C."" (1821) is the only known view of the White House at the time, with a stone wall, triumphal arch and formal gardens stretched out behind it.

Although Neuville traveled in privileged circles, she produced some of the most accurate and sympathetic portraits of marginalized Native Americans and mixed race and enslaved people from that period. (However, ""Mary, a 'Squaw' of the Oneida Tribe,"" from 1807, shown in a striped robe-blanket and leather leggings, uses a term probably derived from the Eastern Algonquian word for ""woman"" that is now considered derogatory.) After returning to France in the 1820s, Neuville appears to have given up painting and drawing. It's a shame, since her vision and craft were so lively and perspicuous. Perhaps, after traveling in seven countries and experiencing harrowing sea voyages, post-revolutionary France seemed a bit boring. MARTHA SCHWENDENER

The range of possibilities is staggering. Three of the American photography pioneers are here: Alfred Stieglitz, with one of his cloud studies (from 1929) that he termed ""Equivalents,"" finding in the sky the visual analogues to his emotional states; Alvin Langdon Coburn, whose ""Eagle"" (1917) was produced with a mirrored lens that fragmented the image like a kaleidoscope to form what he called a ""vortograph""; and a 1917 photogravure by Paul Strand of banded shadows. There are two pictures by Aaron Siskind, the Chicago artist whose photographs shared the gestural vibe of Abstract Expressionist painters, as well as an atypical one by Ralph Eugene Meatyard, a close-up of smeared paint drippings that evokes Willem de Kooning. Contemporary artists bring the story up to date. Hiroshi Sugimoto's ""Lightning Fields 220"" (2009) could be a crackling Barnett Newman zip. Mariah Robertson's ""175"" (2014) splashes chemicals directly on color printing paper to create a cosmic garden. A small gallery at the reinstalled Museum of Modern Art is devoted to photographic abstraction. But anyone seriously interested in the subject should make a point of seeing this far more ambitious, cannily selected and intelligently hung show. ARTHUR LUBOW

After the flags and the targets, after the head-scratching canvases affixed with rulers or silverware, Jasper Johns took a drive out to the Hamptons in 1972 and saw, in the opposite lane of the Long Island Expressway, some kind of crosshatch pattern on a speeding car. Mr. Johns likes a good myth -- but whatever inspired him, America's most pokerfaced painter embraced something like total abstraction in the 1970s, via mirrored or syncopated fields of back-and-forth lines that, on occasion, obfuscated underlying images or designs. Eleven of these crosshatched paintings and works on paper, many lent from Mr. Johns's personal collection and all delighting in irony and misidentification, are on view now at Craig F. Starr. (The show celebrates the gallery's 15th anniversary; its unexpected curator is none other than Agnes Gund, the extraordinary philanthropist who donated Mr. Johns's crosshatched ""Between the Clock and the Bed"" to MoMA.) Whether in the red, yellow and blue slashes of ""Untitled"" (1979) or the more densely chromatic ""Cicada"" (1979), Mr. Johns used crosshatching to reconcile the theatrics of Abstract Expressionism with the matter-of-factness of his own early work. Each one attempts to give form to the paradox of expression through nondisclosure; even a drawing here of ""Dancers on a Plane"" (1982), which supplements the crosshatches with a little symmetrical scrotum, gives away almost nothing about sex or self. Three small works from the ""Between the Clock and Bed"" series, inspired by Edvard Munch, prefigure Mr. Johns's anxious figuration of the 1980s. Yet this show confirms that death and anomie were already haunting the crosshatches as early as 1974, when he christened his tightly packed, carefully mirrored chevrons with a title that could apply to so many of his unquiet abstractions: ""Corpse and Mirror.""

What does radiation look like? How can we envision something we can't see? These questions are at the core of ""Projeto Chernobyl"" (2006-10), a series of radiographs produced by the Brazilian artist Alice Miceli. To make the images, Ms. Miceli developed her own methods for capturing radiation on film (a process most often used for X-rays). She then traveled to Ukraine, where she placed radiographic film around the Chernobyl exclusion zone, an area set aside after the nuclear power plant disaster in 1986 that remains largely abandoned. The film stayed put for anywhere from two to eight months. Some of the negatives were ruined by the elements or couldn't be found again, but Ms. Miceli recovered 30. They're on display at Americas Society, illuminated by light boxes in a dramatically darkened gallery. Outlines of trees or grass are sometimes recognizable, but mostly the images contain swirls and blurs and ghostly voids of gray. Some have white patches so bright, they seem poised to burn through: traces of ""hot spots"" of nuclear contamination, according to the artist. For the viewer, there's a gap between the abstract radiographs and what one knows they're meant to show. It's a haunting and fitting disjunction for trying to comprehend such severe, man-made devastation. We may not be able to fully picture it, but we know that it is real.

Food,"A Quick, Satisfying Fix for Weeknight Chicken",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/28/dining/chicken-breast-recipe-flatten-cutlet.html,"The point isn't so much punishment as it is a corrective measure. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts have two major strikes against them: unevenness of form and leanness of flesh. Fixing the shape helps ensure the meat's juiciness.

When pounded, the tapered shape of a chicken breast (bulging in the middle, slimmer at the ends) flattens out into one even layer. You can whack them thin (one-quarter inch) or thicker (one-half inch or so), but thinner breasts are more apt to overcook. Always keep an eye on them while they are on the heat.

Once you have an evenly sized piece of meat, it is much easier to control the cooking, no matter the method. Whether grilled, broiled or sauteed, a chicken breast is done just as soon as it turns opaque on the surfaces, but stays slightly pink in the center -- well before it has a chance to dry out. Because there is so little fat, the juices are the only thing moistening the meat. Lose those, and the chicken breast turns rubbery.","When pounded thin and marinated, chicken breasts stay juicy and tender.",bfe702ce-7b06-5a1b-9fb7-2752f852aa8f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/02/dining/02APPETITE1/02APPETITE1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=ee37d212eb62c9f7bc3e3424f9e639bad106fac59ca5af8ef55b969d8603b63b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Grilled chicken breasts with spicy cucumbers.,bfe702ce-7b06-5a1b-9fb7-2752f852aa8f,N24News/imgs/bfe702ce-7b06-5a1b-9fb7-2752f852aa8f.jpg,17
Books,"Homeira Qaderi Wants Her Son to Know Her, So She Wrote a Book",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/books/group-text-homeira-qaderi-dancing-in-the-mosque.html,"Of all the indignities and tragedies Homeira Qaderi and her family endured when the Taliban seized Herat, Afghanistan, the most poignant to read about is her father's ritual of hiding the family's books. The Taliban were searching houses for guns, televisions and nonreligious reading material, so he wrapped their cherished library in plastic, placed the bundle in an iron box and buried it under a mulberry tree in the backyard. As Qaderi's grandfather said when he placed a volume of poetry atop the stack, ""We haven't survived this long so that we die now for a bundle of papers.""

For three years, Qaderi's father unearthed the books every spring and spread them out to dry in the sunlight before returning them to their hiding place for another cycle of seasons. When he realized his daughter was a budding author, he switched locations, saying, ""The girl who writes must read stories. I will hide the books in the cellar.""

Qaderi's memoir, DANCING IN THE MOSQUE (HarperCollins, 224 pp., $26.99), is a stunning reminder that stories and words are what sustain us, even -- and perhaps especially -- under the most frightening circumstances. For Qaderi, those contraband volumes were an eye on the horizon, a reminder of liberties worth fighting for. ""In the books taken from the underground box, there were no burqas,"" she writes. ""There was no girl given away to the city's aged holy man, no beaten girl who threw herself down a well to avoid being stoned to death.""

Her own book, gracefully translated by Zaman S. Stanizai, alternates between stories of growing up in Afghanistan -- ""the land of a death foretold"" -- and missives to her son, Siawash, who was taken from her when he was 19 months old. Qaderi doesn't delve into their separation until later chapters, so I'll avoid specifics except to point out that a child of that age is a sentient human being, old enough to place a palm on each of his mother's cheeks and say ""Mine.""

As you read, you feel the weight of the 985 nights that mother and son have been apart; it's the glue binding the spine you hold in your hands. (On a related note: The script font used for the letter sections may strain middle-aged eyes -- a small price to pay for a window into her world.)","When the Taliban halted education for girls, this young activist fought to find her voice as a writer.

Style,"'Lit' Is Over, and Other Things You Can Pay Teens to Teach You",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/18/style/teen-college-students-marketing-consulting.html,"Consulting firms like JUV are helping grown-up brands talk to young people without condescending to them.

'Lit' Is Over, and Other Things You Can Pay Teens to Teach You

When CJ DeLeo founded his record label, Right Coast Music, he knew that reaching teenagers would be crucial to its success. But rather than thumbing through Instagram to figure out how to talk to 10- to 21-year-olds -- or, Generation Z, as the demographic after millennials is sometimes called -- he reached out to JUV Consulting. The company is one of several new marketing firms that illuminate the inner workings of kids these days without condescending to them. How? JUV Consulting is staffed entirely by young people who range in age from 14 to 22. ""I was honestly quite skeptical when I found out they were teenagers,"" Mr. DeLeo admitted. ""After the first call, they blew me away. They could walk into a regular business setting with people in their 30s and 40s and be completely comfortable. They are living the demographic we were targeting.""

""Don't talk about teenagers, talk to teenagers,"" said Ziad Ahmed, 19, JUV's C.E.O. and a rising sophomore at Yale (major undecided). He co-founded the consultancy firm in 2016 with Nick Jain, 19, the company's C.O.O. and a rising sophomore at Princeton and Melinda Guo, 19, who goes to Stanford and serves as a member of the board. This summer, Mr. Ahmed, Mr. Jain and six other members of the executive team lived and worked in a loft in Brooklyn, where they would meet with clients and then just hang out. In addition to an executive team, JUV has five senior partners, 15 junior partners and 90 consultants on staff, all of whom (it should perhaps go without saying) are paid. Their de facto informants consist of friends -- and friends of friends -- from around the world. ""Gen Z moves fast, and so do the trends,"" said Jacob Chang, 19, JUV's director of marketing, and a rising sophomore at the University of Chicago . A big part of his job is flagging memes and whatever is catching viral fire on Twitter. ""There are a lot of things coming in and out of favor,"" he said.

For example, ""'Lit' isn't really cool anymore,"" said Mr. Ahmed. ""Even though a lot of us still colloquially use it, if a company did it, that's cringey. Because lit, our parents now know it."" On the other hand, he said, ""if you were to, in a tweet, use a word like 'hella,' no one's going to be like, that's so cringey, because that's just how we type."" ""Generation Z is Generation We,"" said Mr. Chang . ""We love sharing experiences with each other. And that's why memes have taken off, because it's like the short, shared experience of our humor."" To be clear, the JUV team scoffs at the idea of a ""Gen Z expert"": anyone who pretends to speak for a generation, whether that's a peer or adult. They aren't a research firm, they say. They aren't a focus group. They are, according to Emma Himes, JUV's 18-year-old director of development and a rising sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania, ""a really diverse group of trained teen consultants who can help you."" That approach has earned them work with big-name clients like Viacom and Edelman, as well consulting gigs with smaller nonprofits and businesses. One of the company's most appealing offerings is helping clients navigate social media to avoid the kinds of pitfalls that might make them infamous overnight -- or canceled, in the lingo of the day.

Before the executive team disbanded this month to go back to their colleges (where they will work remotely on a part-time basis during the school year), they would host clients at their loft in Clinton Hill. The space looked like a hangout spot from a high schooler's dreams. There was a long desk in the middle of the light-filled room, where the team plugged in their earbuds and got to work, and a comfy sectional in the corner, where the team would occasionally stop working long enough to watch The Bachelorette. There were walls covered in Post-it notes (both to organize work tasks and delegate chores among the roommates), and pool floats were flung about the space as decoration.",Consulting firms like JÜV are helping grown-up brands talk to young people without condescending to them.,708d7ee8-0544-516f-8c4f-a90542d89526,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/19/fashion/19JUV-2/19JUV-2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=c3c69d35391b07ea5da7bfec5aacb4106d6ae72ca61d4db979cf93c6a450ff1e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"JÜV's co-founder and chief executive, Ziad Ahmed, 19, confers with Shaina Zafar, 18, the company's chief of staff.",708d7ee8-0544-516f-8c4f-a90542d89526,N24News/imgs/708d7ee8-0544-516f-8c4f-a90542d89526.jpg,15
Art & Design,Cool Heat: An Art Outlaw Who Still Simmers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/arts/design/cool-heat-an-art-outlaw-who-still-simmers.html,"What can art do for you? Brighten your wall. Return your investment. Snag you a pass to a V.I.P. lounge. That's about it in the art fair age. And if those are your criteria of aesthetic value, I can't think what you'd make of ""Helio Oiticica: To Organize Delirium"" at the Whitney Museum of American Art, a survey of scrappy, ephemeral work so high on politics, drugs and crazy love as to seem to be from some other planet, which it is: Planet 1960s/'70s, as occupied by one sometimes-transplanted Brazilian artist for 42 brief years. Helio Oiticica (pronounced Oy-ti-SEEK-a) was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1937 into a family of scholarly leftists. His grandfather, a philologist, published an anarchist newspaper; his father was a photographer and a scientist focused on butterflies. Oiticica inherited their broadband curiosity. He was a live-wire gay kid: a talker, a reader, a looker, a dancer. He entered art school at 16 and quickly became the baby member of the Neo-Concretists, one of Brazil's leading avant-garde groups. His art, like theirs, was abstract: A 1955 Oiticica painting -- a bright checkerboard of mango-yellow and red -- opens the show. But the thinking behind their work and his was, in its way, practical. Color and form, purposefully orchestrated, could change the way people feel, think and behave, and thus change the world. Oiticica later disavowed his early pictures as standard, derivative modernism, and he wasn't wrong. But he held on to their originating idea: Art is potent to the degree it merges with life.

By the 1960s, he began to physically demonstrate this merging. He took paintings off the wall and suspended them in the middle of a room. He hammered painted panels into boxlike containers - he called them ""Bolides"" (""Fireballs"") -- that could be picked up and handled. He built free-standing booths called ""Penetrables"" that could be entered, like walk-in paintings. The point was that in all cases the viewer -- the term he preferred was ""participator"" -- physically interacted with the art, and by doing so moved art into life.

When you move into life, you move into politics. In 1964, a military coup brought a right-wing junta to power in Brazil. Oiticica fiercely opposed it, though his politics didn't fall along conventional left-right lines. His hatred of the government was absolute. But so was his rejection of dominant left-wing rhetoric that advocated a new cultural nationalism, a return to a mythical, precolonial ""real"" Brazil. Oiticica positioned himself outside both camps, in outsiderness itself. Being gay was probably a motivator. It put him outside whether he wanted to be or not. It fine-tuned his social-justice radar. He began spending time in Rio's hillside slums, or favelas, home to a population of working poor that the government wanted to expel. There he steeped himself in Afro-Brazilian samba culture, learning its dances and music, which inspired his radically interactive series of works called ""Parangoles.""

The Parangole is a dance costume. Made of cheap, bright enveloping fabrics, painted with taunting slogans and portraits of hero-martyrs, it revealed its full identity as a combination cape, tent and banner only when seen on a moving body. It was a literally activist art form; videos of some being danced are among the show's highlights. In 1965, when Oiticica was in a show at the Museum of Modern Art in Rio, he brought a troupe of Parangole-draped performers to the opening and was refused entry. The performance went on anyway, outside the museum, which is where, he often said, he wanted his art to be.

By the mid-60s, Oiticica's art and career were on a roll. In 1967, at the same museum, he produced his best-known piece, ""Tropicalia."" Reconstructed at the Whitney, it's an artificial garden with banana plants, live parrots, two favela-style huts and a pebble path winding through sand. What might be taken as a homage to Brazilian exoticism is the opposite. The plants are in plastic pots; the staticky noise of a television leaks out from a hut; the words: ""A pureza e um mito"" -- ""Purity is a myth"" - are scrawled on a wall of a second hut. In general, the visual arts had low visibility in Brazil, but the name of Oiticica's show, ""Tropicalia,"" soon went viral. The popular musician Caetano Veloso borrowed it as a song title. His tune, widely interpreted as an anti-authoritarian anthem, climbed the charts and spawned a new countercultural movement, Tropicalismo. In 1969, Mr. Veloso was arrested as a dissident, and then fled to London.

Oiticica was already there, overseeing a retrospective at the Whitechapel Gallery. A year later, he was in New York, where he had work in the much noticed ""Information"" show at the Museum of Modern Art, and planned to build an installation in Central Park. After a quick return to Brazil revealed worsening repression, he decided to make New York his home, at least for the short-term. He stayed for seven years. The Whitney edition of the current retrospective, which appeared earlier at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, puts particular emphasis on Oiticica's New York sojourn. Partly, I suspect, this is to justify a show that significantly challenges the Whitney's founding definition of ""American art."" But it's also because Oiticica's New York years have been little studied. They're a blank, even to most historians. The Whitney curators, Donna De Salvo and Elisabeth Sussman, have tried to fill in that blank. The story they tell isn't an easy one, but it's rich. Oiticica arrived in the city with high expectations. After his MoMA success, he got lots of welcoming hugs. The Central Park project felt exciting. (A maquette is in the show.) Gradually, the momentum slowed. The hugs soon grew fewer. The city, he learned, forgets, ignores. That was O.K. The mainstream art world, everywhere, left him cold. As in Rio, so in New York he kept to the fringes, exploring the city's gay life, visiting the favelas of the South Bronx, enmeshing himself, through his use and sale of cocaine, in the local drug culture.

Time passed. The Central Park project, envisioned as a big adult playground, a theater for creative leisure, never happened. In New York, Oiticica exchanged object-making for filmmaking. The Whitney projects several short films, or fragments, on gallery walls, but they're interesting mostly as 1970s atmosphere. Focus -- Oiticica's focus - is a problem. It's hard to locate from the work on view what he was finding important, politically and aesthetically, and why. Some of his period enthusiasms -- Mick Jagger as revolutionary hero -- just feel naive. Anyone who knew his earlier work knew he could think better than that. And he was thinking better, and feeling deeper, as he watched from afar the political horror show that Brazil had become. A couple of reconstructed installations have impact largely because they're prescient of art by others to come. The homoerotic slide show ""Neyrotika"" prefigures Nan Goldin's ""Ballad of Sexual Dependency."" And ""CC5 Hendrix-War,"" its images splashing across the ceiling and walls of a room hung with hammocks, anticipates Pipilotti Rist. But where the political thinking comes in is in his writing, which is the most gripping work he did in New York -- daily, voluminously as scripts, letters, poems, lists. Dozens of manuscript pages are here; they're displayed only in facsimile and hard to read, but they simmer with a wired free-associative energy that soaks into the films and gives them some purpose. Just as his father had once cataloged butterflies species, Oiticica catalogs, and fancifully names, varieties of cocaine. (The Brazilian-American artist Arto Lindsay recites the list, with a musical lilt, in recordings made for the show.) But by 1978, the New York days were over. Weary, broke and harassed by immigration authorities, Oiticica returned to Rio de Janeiro. The show's final piece, ""PN27 Penetrable, Rijanviera,"" is an abstract portrait of the ""River of January"" city. You enter the modest, cabanalike structure barefoot, walk though shallow currents of gently eddying water and exit -- bathed, baptized -- onto a beach of soft sand. The piece dates from 1979, the year before Oiticica died of a stroke. And it provides a return-to-strength punctuation for a show that, over all, feels sketchy and unfinished. Partly this is because it records an unfinished career, but also because much of that career has been physically lost. In 2009, hundreds, maybe thousands of Oiticica works were destroyed in a storage fire in Rio. Some items were rescued and restored; others have been reproduced as copies. The show has examples of both. The copies can be experienced interactively as the artist intended; the archival pieces are treated with hands-off museum reverence of a kind he claimed to deplore. Did he really deplore it? After all, he preserved quite a bit of work. But he was a person of contradictions: a hedonist with a needle-sharp ethical eye; a marginalist protected by safety nets of class and race. ""Purity is a myth"" applied to him as well as to his art, and he knew it, and the show knows it, which is why it's moving, the way Oiticica's art is moving. Mostly that art is not beautiful; when he made it, it was worth next to nothing; by the end of his life it had gotten him almost nowhere. But it's alive in a way almost no art feels now.","Cocaine, sand and crazy love: Hélio Oiticica's dance into life, on the edge, arrives at the Whitney Museum of American Art.",4e50b693-aa31-541d-9c79-207baf0bbce8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/14/arts/14HELIO/14HELIO-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=50bd793c9604c4aa47055168ecd3ded6555ccc083dd38eaf2608a0604db8ac84&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"An installation view of Hélio Oiticica's best-known piece, ""Tropicália.""",4e50b693-aa31-541d-9c79-207baf0bbce8,N24News/imgs/4e50b693-aa31-541d-9c79-207baf0bbce8.jpg,14
Real Estate,"Michael Shvo Is Back, and as Brash as Ever",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/realestate/michael-shvo-is-back-and-as-brash-as-ever.html,"At the height of the real estate boom, the broker Michael Shvo brashly coined the phrase ""Let's Shvo"" to define his style of marketing. That meant 24-hour sales offices, parties featuring red carpets and leggy models, and aggressive selling tactics that some considered questionable. Then, when the market crashed, Mr. Shvo became as elusive as he had once been ubiquitous. Now, after having taken a few years off to work on his art collecting, he's back. And this time, Mr. Shvo, 40, has refashioned himself as a real estate developer. He is older now, and married -- to a petite blonde, the former Seren Ceylan, whom he met in Istanbul in 2009. And he is hoping to distance himself from the Diet Coke-swilling hyperkinetic person who, rather than wait for a contract to be expressed from Mexico City, hopped a plane. Gone are the 18-hour workdays and the cellphones attached to both ears. On a recent morning, his single phone was put in silent mode and went unanswered for nearly two hours. And yet, there are signs that he hasn't completely escaped his past. To create buzz for his first project as a developer, for example, he converted the site, a Getty filling station in West Chelsea, into a pastoral landscape replete with a carpet of grass and sheep sculptures by the artist Francois-Xavier Lalanne. At the opening, by a white picket fence, women in short dresses checked off names; a bartender served Champagne from behind a counter where gas sales had once been rung up. The expense -- he hired two publicity firms and a social media company to create a Twitter feed -- seemed very 2007.

On a recent weekday morning, Mr. Shvo was sitting in a bronze chair in his living room on the 68th floor of the Time Warner Center, his white collared shirt unbuttoned to reveal a patch of chest hair. Reflecting on how, this time, his foray into real estate will be different, he said: ""I used to have to work to live. Now, I can live and enjoy the work."" Mr. Shvo, as the story goes, arrived in New York in 1996 from Israel with just $3,000 in his pocket. He managed a fleet of taxis before becoming a broker at Douglas Elliman, where he quickly rose up the ranks. By 2003, at age 30, Mr. Shvo was the firm's top producer, with more than 400 deals totaling $300 million in sales. But many bristled at his ego, and critics questioned strategies like approaching other brokers' clients, which he denies having done. At one point the firm required him to take an industry ethics course. A close alliance he had formed with Elliman's then-reigning superbroker, Dolly Lenz, devolved into acrimony. By 2004 he had left Elliman and formed SHVO Marketing. The real estate market continued to gain speed, and his firm's tag line, ""Let's Shvo,"" was often parodied even as the cash came flowing in. ""From 2003 until 2008,"" he said, ""I did $15 billion worth of real estate deals worldwide."" Projects included Nurai, an island off Abu Dhabi where he set up a 30,000-square-foot sales office and, he said, proceeded to sell $750 million worth of real estate in just 36 hours. He describes 20 Pine, the office conversion in the financial district, which featured interiors by the designer Giorgio Armani, as ""a seminal moment in worldwide real estate."" ""I created what is known as the marriage of fashion and real estate,"" he said, with unabashed hyperbole.

But when the market began to stumble, so did Mr. Shvo. Sales languished at 20 Pine, despite a sales office that he kept open 24 hours a day, and Mr. Shvo was soon replaced. The building did not sell out until earlier this year -- some seven years after its inauguration. Mr. Shvo was replaced on other projects and was named in lawsuits. To hear him tell it, though, he predicted the market meltdown and decided to pull out pre-emptively. ""In December 2007,"" he said, ""I was asked by the board of the Hilton hotel chain to give a talk about the state of the real estate market. The talk was titled 'The Era of Excess,' and I predicted that the world was like an obese man who had eaten too much and was going to have a heart attack. At that point, I decided it is time to retire and focus on my art collection."" ""When you do something, you do it right and do it the whole way, or don't do it at all,"" he continued. ""When I decided to spend three years focusing on building our art collection, it was done with the same meticulous details as I would build a building."" When the bubble was at its biggest, he told reporters that he owned so many apartments as investments that he didn't know the exact number. These days, he said, he owns only the roofs over his head-- the Time Warner Center apartment and a house in the Hamptons. But during his hiatus, he did sometimes take a break from art and check out possible development sites. He said he was touring a hotel parcel in early March when a broker mentioned another site that was about to come on the market in West Chelsea, the Getty station at the corner of 10th Avenue and 24th Street. ""I went back to my office and within an hour, I had sent the broker a proposal,"" Mr. Shvo said. Getty rejected the offer, opting to go through a public bidding process. So, Mr. Shvo said, he competed against more than 30 other bidders through three cycles until he came out the winner, offering $23.5 million, a record for the neighborhood. ""I was determined to buy the site,"" said Mr. Shvo, who is an equal partner on the project with Victor Homes, the development and construction company.

As soon as the deal was done, he sent out a news alert trumpeting the $850 a square foot he had paid for the land -- a new high and not something most developers would brag about. Critics also questioned the environmental risks of building on the site of a gas station. For his part, Mr. Shvo said, the price was a bargain. ""It is not about how much you pay for the land, but what you make out of it. If you are a visionary and you look ahead and imagine what something will be once it is complete, your idea of price is completely different."" Despite his critics, Mr. Shvo is forging ahead. He recently went into contract for a second, even more ambitious development, in partnership with Erez Itzhaki of the Keystone Group. The project, 100 Varick Street, is to be built on nearly half an acre between Broome and Watts Streets. The site is an assemblage of several town houses, development parcels and air rights that took six months to acquire. The developers are proposing a 30-story condominium and expect to complete more than $800 million in sales. He says he also is putting together two deals near Central Park in Midtown, one of them for a 100-story tower. Yet although Mr. Shvo is hoping for a fresh start as a developer, some of the habits that rankled his former colleagues in the brokerage world could do so again. During a recent conversation, he took much of the credit for 100 Varick Street. But Bridget Griffin, the head of acquisitions at Keystone Group, says it was ""Erez who was sourcing all the sites, and Michael asked if he could join in."" Mr. Shvo tends to shrug off his critics. ""Some people say that I'm difficult,"" he said, ""and my answer to that is that it isn't about being difficult. It is about perfection. Do something and do it to the fullest, with no flaws, or don't do it at all.""","Once ubiquitous as a broker, Mr. Shvo pulled out before the real estate bubble burst.

Music,"A German Opera Spotlights the Refugee Crisis, With Refugees",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/12/arts/music/germany-refugee-crisis-opera-munich.html,"MUNICH -- ""We tell the story of Moses because it is actually our story,"" one teenager, a refugee from Afghanistan by way of Iran, said in the Hazaragi dialect to the German-speaking audience at the Bavarian State Opera here on a recent Sunday evening. Others chimed in: ""The story of Moses is also my story,"" they said in French, Kurdish, Greek and Arabic. They were the cast of ""Moses,"" a feel-good yet sobering new production by the Bavarian State Opera's youth program, written for refugees, children of immigrants and born-and-raised Bavarians.

The director Jessica Glause, who created the libretto based on interviews with refugees in the cast, has concocted a blend of humor, horror and youthful energy that hardly feels like a didactic documentary about Europe's refugee crisis. Behind the scenes, ""Moses"" has provided a way to learn German and make friends -- in short, to make the process of migration a little less painful. And audiences have responded favorably: The work's premiere run, last December, sold out, and because of demand, performances were added to the revival at the Munich Opera Festival in July. Theater about the refugee crisis has proliferated in Germany since migration into the country reached its peak in 2016. But rarely has the hot-button issue -- which continues to threaten Chancellor Angela Merkel's power and fuel the rise of the far-right party Alternative for Germany, or AfD -- entered the realm of opera, much less children's opera.

Ms. Gessat said that in the first half of 2016, when the production was still in development, she and her team thought of featuring refugees in the cast -- no musical experience required -- and eventually ""Noye's Fludde"" became simply ""Noah,"" an adaptation that included their stories. That summer, while Ms. Gessat and her colleagues were on vacation, some of the darkest stories from the refugee crisis began to emerge: harrowing boat rides across the Mediterranean Sea that left many dead, and governments struggling to reckon with a massive influx of people in need of homes and livelihood. ""When we came back,"" Ms. Gessat said, ""our idea was suddenly very relevant.""

Among the people she spoke with were Ali Madad Qorbani, a young man from Afghanistan who fled to Iran, then Europe, after his father had disappeared; and Zahra Akhlaqi, also from Afghanistan, whose mother came to Europe first while she and her sister waited in Iran, where, she said, they were forbidden from going to school but would dress up like students at home and play pretend.

Now, their lives are slightly more stable, though just as precarious as any refugee's. Mr. Qorbani is an intern at the Bavarian State Opera, and Ms. Akhlaqi is a bright student who said she learned German in part by reading canonical literature like Goethe's ""Faust"" and Thomas Mann's ""The Magic Mountain."" (She also speaks fluent English.) The heart of ""Moses"" is how they and other refugees in the cast have adjusted to life in Munich. If ""Noah"" was an opera about a journey, then ""Moses"" is about what comes after, with questions about what it means to find a home and how to fit in somewhere new. There are still monologues of how and why some of the cast members came to Europe, but much of the material is about reconciling their faiths and cultures with those of Germany -- including one humorous passage about trying German beer for the first time. But they also describe how they don't always feel welcome, such as a scene in which the plagues in Moses's story give way to one person describing signs near Munich that say refugees overrun Germany like locusts. Moments like this are sobering reminders in an otherwise uplifting story. Life offstage unfolds in much the same way, with stretches of happiness punctuated by harsh reality checks.

At a recent rehearsal, for example, the cast members behaved more like friends than colleagues: greeting each other with hugs, and cheerfully working together on a challenging, even avant-garde production. Away from the opera house, Ms. Akhlaqi is close with Mila Stephan, one of the Germans, who said they like to hang out and cook Italian food together. But there was also the day one of the cast members, a Nigerian refugee named Unity Okojie, went missing. He had performed in the premiere run of ""Moses"" in January, but could not be found for the revival this summer. Ms. Gessat said he could still be in Munich, or back in Africa; they just don't know. His absence has been written into the show. At the moment where he should be making his entrance onstage, Ms. Stephan and Martin Lucke, another German cast member, address the audience, telling them what Unity would be saying if he were there and explaining the instability of life for sub-Saharan refugees. Toward the end of the opera, Ms. Stephan and Mr. Lucke sing ""Unity's School,"" a catchy English-language number about assimilation; it later served as a crowd-pleasing encore that had even the usher, Stefan Schubert, dancing and mouthing the words. The Bavarian State Opera's youth program will return next season with another refugee-minded adaptation: an Adam and Eve story, based on Haydn's ""The Creation."" While it is in development, the AfD party -- with its nationalistic criticisms of state-funded institutions that engage topics like the refugee crisis -- continues to gain ground in German politics.

But, in interviews, Ms. Gessat and Ms. Glause were quick to say that their job is to reflect the world around them, and that it would be irresponsible to ignore the refugee crisis. Indeed, Ms. Glause said that conservative politicians may change their minds if they met the cast of ""Moses."" ""I would tell them to come see this show,"" she said. ""Come hear these stories.""","""Moses,"" a production by the Bavarian State Opera's youth program, brings together a cast of teenage refugees, children of immigrants and Germans.",0422ef6e-d867-53d8-8832-90c932e9bc46,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/11/arts/11MOSES4/11MOSES4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=f1678c7cf14575989a1ec0e02ed9ccff9a66468f2065189e3b4420221e96186a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The director Jessica Glause, center, in a rehearsal for ""Moses,"" a work about refugees and assimilation at the Bavarian State Opera.",0422ef6e-d867-53d8-8832-90c932e9bc46,N24News/imgs/0422ef6e-d867-53d8-8832-90c932e9bc46.jpg,12
Technology,"As Silicon Valley Gets 'Crazy,' Midwest Beckons Tech Investors",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/technology/midwest-tech-startups.html,"COLUMBUS, Ohio -- They seem an odd couple. J. D. Vance, author of ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" his best-selling memoir of growing up in the postindustrial Midwest and his journey of escape. And Steve Case, the billionaire co-founder of America Online. But Mr. Vance joined Mr. Case's investment firm this year to scour the Midwest for small yet promising start-ups, particularly for a new seed fund. The firm, Revolution, plans to raise up to $100 million for that fund's investments, it disclosed in a filing last month with the Securities and Exchange Commission. They are by no means the only notable investors seeking opportunity in the region. Four years ago, Mark Kvamme, a top venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, left the heart of the tech industry to become a tech investor here in the Midwest heartland. After a slow start, his firm has raised $550 million and invested in 26 companies. Its bet is that the middle of America amounts to an undervalued asset, rich in markets, new business ideas and budding entrepreneurs. The Midwest, the thinking goes, is not only untapped, but also an antidote to the scalding-hot tech market on the West Coast.



""Silicon Valley is kind of crazy now,"" Mr. Kvamme said. The money, power and influence of tech companies on the West Coast have reached new heights. Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon are now the four most valuable companies in the country. Venture capital, the financial fuel for new companies, is also concentrated on the coast. More than 50 percent of all venture capital money spent in the United States goes to companies in California alone, according to the National Venture Capital Association. But some investors, led by people like Mr. Kvamme and his firm, Drive Capital, see plenty of potential in the center of the country. Focusing on the Midwest is no longer considered a nutty idea, as it was by skeptical West Coast venture capitalists when Mr. Kvamme and Chris Olsen, another Silicon Valley transplant from Sequoia Capital and co-founder of Drive Capital, made the move in 2013. Every major Midwestern city now has clusters of start-up accelerators and incubators, typically housed in renovated red-brick industrial buildings.

Deals like those are still rare. But local entrepreneurs and big investors are scouting the Midwest for start-up investments that range up to tens of millions of dollars, far more than local angel and venture investors. And they are beginning to attract venture capital from Silicon Valley for follow-on rounds of funding. The rationale for investing in the Midwest combines cost and opportunity. A top-flight software engineer who is paid $100,000 a year in the Midwest might well command $200,000 or more in the Bay Area. The Midwest, the optimists say, also has ample tech talent, with excellent engineers coming out of major state and private universities in the region. But they also point to technology shifts. As technology transforms nontech industries like health care, agriculture, transportation, finance and manufacturing, the Midwest investors argue that being close to customers will be more important than being close to the wellspring of technology. ""The value will come from marrying industry knowledge with technology,"" said Mr. Olsen of Drive Capital. ""There's an arrogance in Silicon Valley that we don't need industry expertise. That's going to be less and less true in the future."" But broadening the geography of innovation-fueled economic growth will require capital. Today, three-quarters of all venture capital invested in America goes to California, New York and Massachusetts, the National Venture Capital Association estimated. Ohio gets less than 1 percent and the 12-state Midwest region less than 10 percent in total, according to figures compiled by the State Science and Technology Institute. ""There are two Americas,"" Mr. Case said. ""One with an abundance of capital and opportunity -- in Silicon Valley and pockets around the nation. But not in the other America, and that other America is most of the country.""

Mr. Case served on White House advisory councils on jobs, innovation and entrepreneurship during the Obama administration, and that experience, he said, shaped his thinking about investing in the Midwest. Since 2011, his firm has raised more than $1 billion for two funds, Revolution Ventures and Revolution Growth, which generally make investments of $4 million to $50 million, including in start-ups in the Midwest. Both Mr. Case and Mr. Vance, whose career path went through the Marines, Ohio State University and Yale Law School and then to a Silicon Valley venture firm, view building businesses as a social virtue as well. Referring to the troubles chronicled in his book, Mr. Vance said that ""at least a partial solution is to get more investment capital into this part of the country."" The firm also sponsors road trips in a colorfully painted bus that it calls Rise of the Rest, also the name of Revolution's new $100 million investment fund. Mr. Case and members of his team leave Revolution's base in Washington, D.C., to visit and champion emerging start-up communities in cities across the country. Since 2014, there have been six such tours, and the most recent one ended last month after stops in central Pennsylvania; Ann Arbor, Mich.; Indianapolis; Columbus; and Green Bay, Wis.

The day in Columbus was typical. There were seven stops, including three start-up hubs, with Mr. Case and Mr. Vance listening and speaking at each location. Mr. Case and Mr. Vance talk of the need to create ""network density"" by bringing together more entrepreneurs, customers, partners and investment capital. The trips can and do yield investment candidates for Revolution, but start-up evangelism is the main theme. There are encouraging signs in Columbus. The city's start-up clusters are full of activity. At the Idea Foundry, a two-story refurbished factory, one tenant is the Smart Columbus project. Last year, Columbus beat out several locations -- including San Francisco; Austin, Tex.; Denver; and Portland, Ore. -- to win a $50 million federal Transportation Department ""smart city"" grant. That was initial funding for a public-private partnership to develop technology to tackle problems from managing self-driving car traffic to reducing infant mortality. The Kauffman Foundation, which studies start-up activity, reported last month that Columbus ranked third among 40 metropolitan areas in ""growth entrepreneurship,"" the share of start-ups that employ 50 or more workers within 10 years. CrossChx, a five-year-old start-up with a payroll of 80 people, is one of them. The company, which makes health care software, has raised $35 million of venture funding in three rounds. Drive Capital spotted the company, led the early financing and has since been joined by Bay Area investors including Khosla Ventures and Silicon Valley Bank. In Ohio, that $35 million is the equivalent of $70 million in the Valley in terms of being able to hire talent and sustain operating costs, said Sean Lane, CrossChx's co-founder and chief executive. ""I'm not sure we would have made it through the zigs and zags if we were in the Valley,"" Mr. Lane said.

CrossChx is one of more than two dozen companies in Drive Capital's portfolio. To date, none have folded, and they are generating more than $150 million in revenue. After three years -- its first fund started investing in 2014 -- the firm's gains look good on paper. But it is too early to declare its Midwest bet a success. That will take a few more years, and the proof will be if it delivers high returns to its limited-partner investors. ""And if two guys from Silicon Valley and Sequoia can't do it,"" Mr. Olsen said, ""capital isn't going to come here.""","Funding and start-ups are concentrated on the coasts, especially in California. But there are signs of an entrepreneurial awakening in the heartland, where talent is rich but prices aren't.",dee3c968-e57d-586d-8075-b37898fc94c3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/20/business/20middle1/20middle1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=536&w=1024&s=f6e4fd8d37eb2de8bd15431e229bf290dea48e2a70068196155131cb6ff9d2fb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A presentation, left, that is part of a Rise of the Rest tour at the Idea Foundry, an innovation center in a former factory in Columbus, Ohio.

Movies,Want a Halloween Thriller as Daring as 'Psycho'? Try 'Peeping Tom',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/movies/psycho-peeping-tom.html,"Gateway Movies offers ways to begin exploring directors, genres and topics in film by examining a few streaming movies. If I had the ability to wipe my memory of one movie and then take a time machine back to watch it at its very first screening, I would pick ""Psycho"" (1960). I suspect that would be a common choice. The goal wouldn't simply be to recapture the excitement of my initial viewing long ago -- when I braced for the shower scene even though I knew to expect it -- but to come to that viewing completely cold, without knowing there was a shower scene at all and without being aware of how boldly Hitchcock would challenge narrative conventions. But Hitchcock wasn't the only director who released a film in 1960 that pushed the boundaries of onscreen violence or raciness, or that represented a decisive break from anything he had done before. Michael Powell's ""Peeping Tom"" also qualifies and, in some ways, is even more confrontational in raising questions about the audience's relationship to the screen. Until then, Powell had been one of the leading lights of the British film industry, and the scandalousness of ""Peeping Tom"" reputedly hastened the end of his career there (although some have argued that the circumstances were more complex). Imagine a ""Psycho"" told primarily from the killer's perspective and in which the killer, a filmmaker himself, is equated at various points with both the director and the viewer.

""Peeping Tom"" has had an enduring influence on filmmakers like Martin Scorsese, who was instrumental in its revival, as well as on Brian De Palma and Kathryn Bigelow, whose ""Strange Days"" puts a virtual-reality spin on the protagonist's obsession with orchestrating a particular kind of murder. But the cultural footprint of ""Peeping Tom"" is surely lighter than that of ""Psycho"" -- which means if you're lucky, you may be able to experience it fresh, with all its shocks unexpected. (If that's you, maybe save this article for later.)

""Peeping Tom"": Stream it on Amazon Prime, the Criterion Channel or Tubi; rent it on Google Play or iTunes. Powell is not an easy director to box in; his nearly 50 years of filmmaking can't be reduced to a shorthand description. But he is best known for his work in the 1940s and '50s with his directing, screenwriting and producing partner, Emeric Pressburger -- and particularly for their lavish Technicolor productions like ""A Matter of Life and Death"" and ""The Red Shoes,"" both outstanding places to start in a less Halloween-y week. But the first sequence in ""Peeping Tom"" is like nothing else in Powell's career -- and maybe nothing else until films like John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" (1978) made the serial killer's point-of-view shot a familiar screen trope nearly two decades later. Much of the sequence plays out through the cross-haired viewfinder of a movie camera, as Mark (Carl Boehm), the man we will soon come to understand is our surrogate, hires a prostitute and stalks her up a stairway to a room, secretly recording her with the Bell & Howell he has hidden in his coat. As he closes in on her, and a glinting light flashes across her face, she screams. Cut to a projector rolling in Mark's private screening room as he watches the film he's just shot. Although Mark's black-and-white footage has no sound, the driving piano score accompanying it transforms the images into something that resembles a vintage silent movie. Being a voyeur, seeing terror and excitement in others' faces -- these are the fundamental ingredients of cinema.

Mark knows firsthand the look of fear he wants to capture. As he will explain to Helen (Anna Massey), his neighbor from downstairs, he had no privacy growing up: He was always being filmed by his father (Powell in a cameo), a scientist who wanted a total record of a child's upbringing. The father was also interested in the nervous system's reaction to fear, and so he found ways to scare Mark while filming him. What Mark doesn't reveal to Helen is that he has cultivated his father's interest, and pushed it to murderous extremes. Mark's duality -- shy artiste and secret killer -- extends even to his occupations. He works one job photographing nude women in a space above a newsstand, where the photographs are sold under the table. (Mark is hardly the only one in the movie hiding violence; the first woman we see him photograph asks to be shot in a way that won't show the bruises inflicted by her fiance.) More respectably, he works as a focus puller at a film studio, where, amusingly, a director is having trouble getting an actress to faint, despite having a covert master of shock on his crew. As others have noted, Powell doesn't disguise Boehm's German accent, which amid the English accents elsewhere is simply another means of keeping us off-balance around Mark. Powell has always been a maximalist when it comes to color and shadow, pushing them well beyond the confines of naturalism and into an almost abstract, primal realm. Some shots in ""Peeping Tom"" have so many hues, it's as if he's trying to capture every color on the spectrum. But even the quieter scenes demonstrate a dazzling and discomforting use of complementary colors. Note how, when Helen and Mark go on a date, Massey and Boehm's coats have been carefully matched with the decorative palette of the building they live in.

The film's centerpiece -- and another stunning use of color -- is the second murder. Mark has conspired to keep a stand-in at the studio, Vivian (Moira Shearer), after hours, to film her finally getting a chance to act. She asks what Mark wants her to play. He tells her to mimic being frightened to death -- which won't be hard. The suspense is suitably Hitchcockian: Much as Janet Leigh's shower leading up to her murder lulls viewers even as they subconsciously await the worst, Vivian is shown, at great length, dancing to a jazz number to warm up for her big scare scene. The sequence holds up a dark mirror to ""The Red Shoes."" In that film, Shearer played a ballet dancer who was prepared to dance until she dropped dead. In ""Peeping Tom,"" she dances to her death unwittingly. In another Hitchcockian sequence, while Mark and Helen are on a date, Powell cuts back to Mark's darkroom, where the tick-tick of a timer is measuring the development of the film on which Mark has recorded Vivian's murder. ""Peeping Tom"" arrived early in a wave of cinema that deigned to deconstruct the medium and show its tools: Mark is a one-man camera crew, director, film processor and -- more obliquely -- sound man. And while the movie's power as a pure thriller endures, the film also leaves viewers with a disturbing implication: that we, as spectators who want more movies and more thrills, on some level always root for Mark to succeed.","Michael Powell's disturbing chronicle of a murderous filmmaker was ahead of its time, influencing Martin Scorsese, Brian De Palma and Kathryn Bigelow.",de19e708-7fa5-541f-903a-1b4a99c21032,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/22/arts/22gateway-chiller14/22gateway-chiller14-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=62730cb4eefde25c9afeb00a9d595566787a452ec64e08b6f2141f43ade48d38&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Brenda Bruce as a victim caught in the cross-hairs of a viewfinder in ""Peeping Tom"" (1960), which, along with ""Psycho"" the same year, pushed the boundaries of the audience-screen relationship.",de19e708-7fa5-541f-903a-1b4a99c21032,N24News/imgs/de19e708-7fa5-541f-903a-1b4a99c21032.jpg,5
