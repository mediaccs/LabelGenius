Television,"Jon Huber, Who Rose to Fame With World Wrestling Entertainment, Dies at 41",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/27/arts/television/brodie-lee-death-luke-harper-jon-huber.html,"Jon Huber, a pro wrestler known in the ring as Luke Harper and Brodie Lee, died on Saturday. He was 41.

His death followed a battle with a ""lung issue"" unrelated to Covid-19, his wife, Amanda Huber, said on Instagram.

Aside from his wife, he is survived by his two children.

Mr. Huber rose to fame with World Wrestling Entertainment, where he was known for his soft-spoken intensity in the ring.

During his time with WWE, he found success in the independent circuit before joining the NXT brand.

He battled other wrestling stars, including The Shield, Kane, Daniel Bryan, John Cena and the Usos, using a combination of ""aggressive offense and demented mind games,"" WWE said.","Mr. Huber, who was known in the ring as Brodie Lee and Luke Harper, died from a ""lung issue"" unrelated to Covid-19, his wife said.",6bd0ced9-9403-524a-9cb9-4e41a2383fd6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/25/multimedia/25xp-huber/25xp-huber-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Jon Huber, who was also known as Luke Harper, was known for his soft-spoken intensity in the ring.",6bd0ced9-9403-524a-9cb9-4e41a2383fd6,N24News/imgs/6bd0ced9-9403-524a-9cb9-4e41a2383fd6.jpg,3
Fashion & Style,"Experiences, With a Bow on Them",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/26/fashion/gifts-experiences-four-seasons-hotels.html,"HONG KONG -- Gretchen Smelter wanted to surprise her husband, Frederic Lagrange, when he returned after a monthlong assignment in the remote northern reaches of Afghanistan -- and to make the most of their time together before his next trip. So when Mr. Lagrange, a travel photographer, arrived home, frostbitten, longhaired and malodorous, he learned his wife had booked two nights at the Four Seasons Hotel Hong Kong. For the Hong Kong residents, the 2012 experience wasn't a vacation but a ""staycation"" -- a getaway just a short drive from their apartment. Together, they enjoyed a luxurious weekend with plush surroundings, fine dining and spa treatments. ""Frederic was so happy,"" Ms. Smelter recalled, grinning. ""So happy. He still talks about it now."" Like Ms. Smelter and Mr. Lagrange, many people are choosing to spend their disposable income on experiences over material goods, overhauling the ritual of gift giving. If you're still wrapping presents this holiday season, you might be behind the times.

Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus, co-founders of theminimalists.com, tend not to give or accept physical gifts. In their film ""Minimalism: A Documentary About the Important Things,"" they explain that their lifestyle is about removing the superfluous: if a possession doesn't serve a purpose or bring them joy, it has to go. Growing inequality and climate change are fueling a disdain for conspicuous consumerism, Mr. Nicodemus said from his home in Montana. ""It's becoming apparent we can't continue to produce and consume goods on this level."" For his 31st birthday, in 2012, Mr. Nicodemus asked for donations to build a well in Cambodia. Through a nonprofit organization called charity: water he was able to help supply clean water for more than 250 people. Two years later, for Mr. Millburn's 33rd birthday, they raised more than $30,000 for the organization. Mr. Nicodemus explained minimalism isn't all about saving money or the planet, it's simply putting people above possessions. At the top of his wish list are a ski pass, a cruise and a trip into space. The ski pass at least, he could tick off in Queenstown, New Zealand. The alpine resort town has developed a reputation as the ""birthplace of adventure tourism,"" said Graham Budd, chief executive of Destination Queenstown. When Prince William and his wife, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, visited in 2014, the couple was treated to a wild ride down the Shotover River.

There is an abundance of research showing people get more satisfaction from experiences than they do from possessions. Amit Kumar, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Chicago, said he studies ""what makes people happy."" Most of his research has focused on personal purchases, but the underlying mechanisms remain the same in the context of gift giving, he added.

One reason is that people are more likely to talk about experiences after the fact. Even if the experiences don't go as planned, people are inclined to remember them fondly. ""I tend to call that the broader social value of experiences,"" Mr. Kumar said. ""Experiences don't just make us happy while we're consuming them or when we're telling stories about them afterwards, but indeed even before the experience has happened at all. If you're looking forward to a dinner or concert, that period of waiting is a positive state. The same can hardly be said for when you're lining up at a store counter. Christoph Schmidinger, general manager of the Four Seasons Hotel Hong Kong, has been in the hotel business for more than 40 years. He said over that time he has seen industry language shift from talking about ""service"" to talking about ""experience."" ""Everybody has a different expectation and understanding of luxury,"" he said, adding that it helps hotel staff members when guests brief them about why they're staying in the hotel.

What does luxury mean to him? ""I'm going to say two sentences which I think say it all,"" Mr. Schmidinger said, leaning forward in his armchair. ""Products are made and consumed. Services are created and experienced. ""If you want to be a real luxury hotel you have to focus on the second one."" There is a ""moment of truth,"" he said, when a customer and an employee ""connect."" During one stay abroad, for example, he returned to his room to find a new tube of toothpaste where his near-empty tube had been, as well as a signed note from the room attendant: ""Your toothpaste is coming to an end and I didn't want you to be in trouble."" The Four Season's records show that in 2015, there were 11 staycations per month on average -- usually to celebrate anniversaries, birthdays or other special occasions. In 2016, that figure has risen to 38 per month at the 399-room hotel. The Ultimate Suite Dream Experience indulges this trend at the highest level. For 139,000 Hong Kong dollars, or about $18,000, per night, guests receive unlimited access to hotel services and facilities. But an experience, even one that doesn't come with such a hefty price tag, is still more valuable than spending the same amount on a possession. ""I know this from my own experience,"" Mr. Schmidinger said. ""My wife and I still talk about our vacations, years later.""",Sometimes a hotel stay or a charitable donation can be the most memorable presents.,ec98e76f-ec57-51a1-bf5e-b322d95ed1c4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/28/style/28MINIMALIST01-INYT/28MINIMALIST01-INYT-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=67f1dece7e8a77723aca38d804626ab4d4c0fad206dabfdf98dc15dc27d88317&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Pool Terrace at the Four Seasons Hong Kong.,ec98e76f-ec57-51a1-bf5e-b322d95ed1c4,N24News/imgs/ec98e76f-ec57-51a1-bf5e-b322d95ed1c4.jpg,19

Television,Late Night Thinks William Barr Should Show Up for Work,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/arts/television/attorney-general-william-barr.html,"Seth Meyers mocked Attorney General William Barr for his no-show at a House committee hearing. (So did Representative Steve Cohen, who brought a bucket of chicken.)

Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night's highlights that lets you sleep -- and lets us get paid to watch comedy. If you're interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. As promised, William Barr did not show up to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday. The panel wanted him questioned about the Mueller report by staff lawyers, not just members of Congress, and he objected. ""Barr said he would not attend because of a dispute about the questioning format. Specifically, he didn't like the part where they asked questions and he had to answer them."" -- JAMES CORDEN ""At one point, he tried hiding in a White House closet, but Melania was like, 'Hey, get your own place.'"" -- JIMMY FALLON ""You're the attorney general! You can't just skip work whenever you feel like it. The only person who can do that is the president."" -- JAMES CORDEN

Democrats were not happy with Barr's decision. One congressman, Steve Cohen, brought a chicken statue and a bucket of KFC to the hearing. He was making a point, but Trevor Noah wondered if he'd just been hungry.

 ""It could have just been his breakfast, and someone was, like, 'Oh, is that KFC some kind of political statement?' [As Cohen] 'Oh, yeah, that's what it is. And the drink is because we need to shake things up!'"" -- TREVOR NOAH ""Man, this confirms everyone's worst fear. If you don't show up to a party, the people who do are gonna talk [expletive] about you."" -- SETH MEYERS President Trump hosted a National Day of Prayer breakfast at the White House on Thursday. That amused Stephen Colbert, who says Trump ""has never read one word of the Bible before."" The ""Late Show"" host found it particularly funny that the president used the occasion to brag about his influence on (as Colbert put it) ""this country's No. 1 spiritual concern: mall signage."" Specifically, Trump took credit for ""stores nowadays"" wishing shoppers a Merry Christmas again. ""Yes, it's true. Go to any mall in America right now and it is Christmas. We're proudly getting ready for our Yule-time cookouts, our Noel fireworks shows, our nativity pool parties, kids selling mulled lemonade!"" -- STEPHEN COLBERT Seth Meyers noted that a Christian band had performed worship songs in the Rose Garden, saying it was ""nice to know that every once in a while [Trump]'s suffering, too.""

The Punchiest Punchlines (Still at the Barr Edition) ""You already know in amongst all of this that Trump is jealous about all of the attention Barr is getting right now. Do you know what I mean? Trump is like 'What? Hey, I've committed way more crimes than that guy. He covered up my crimes."" -- JAMES CORDEN ""Yes, when the attorney general lies to Congress, it is a crime. When the president does it, it is the State of the Union."" -- STEPHEN COLBERT, on Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats calling for Barr to resign

Travel,Small Colorado Resort Goes Big With a $700 Lift Ticket,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/travel/colorado-resort-expensive-lift-ticket.html,"Driving from Denver to Aspen, Colo., one passes the country's most expensive ski resorts: Breckenridge, Vail, Beaver Creek and Sunlight. Yes, Sunlight Mountain, an upstart in Glenwood Springs, Colo., that is home to a $700 a day lift ticket, new for this season. With only three chairlifts available to them, most Sunlight skiers are content with the standard $63 ticket for a day on the slopes, and may feel virtuous when comparing that with the price of peak-season walk-up lift tickets at other area resorts: $189 at Vail and Beaver Creek, $171 at Breckenridge and $159 at Aspen Snowmass. Yet, there are those who are happy to pay for the Sunny 700. ""I get bragging rights: I got the most expensive lift ticket ever,"" said Jennifer Belle, of Santa Fe, N.M., who bought one as a Christmas gift for her son, 21.

It is not as indulgent as it sounds. The ticket comes with a pair of Meier skis, handmade in Colorado from beetle-kill wood with graphics commemorating Sunlight's 50th anniversary, and a ticket for a soak at Iron Mountain Hot Springs. If bought separately, the three things would cost slightly more. ""What we like about the Sunny 700 is that you're left with a great pair of skis at the end of the day, not just a sore pair of legs,"" said Troy Hawks, the resort's marketing director. He would not reveal how many of the $700 tickets ($600 for snowboarders) have sold, but said it was in the ""double digits"" with buyers in Colorado, Indiana, New Mexico, Texas and Utah. ""For me to give my son this $700 ticket is kind of an inside joke,"" Ms. Belle said. ""Sunlight is a local kind of ski resort."" Sunlight markets itself as an easygoing place for families, and gives local fourth-grade students free season passes.

Seventy-five percent of the terrain is rated as beginner or intermediate, and all 67 trails lead to the lodge, making it difficult for children to get lost. But to appreciate Sunlight and its tongue-in-cheek ticket price is to understand that the resort has always been overshadowed by Aspen, which sits at the opposite end of the Roaring Fork Valley in western Colorado. The first ski hill on Compass Mountain, where Sunlight is, opened in 1946 under the name Holiday Hill. That was the same year the Aspen Skiing Company was incorporated. By the time Sunlight resort opened in 1966, Aspen Skiing Company had acquired Buttermilk Mountain, and the next year it opened Snowmass. In 1993, the two companies hit simultaneous milestones. Aspen Skiing Company bought Aspen Highlands to create a single four-mountain resort. Sunlight, opened up new territory that added a dozen black and double black diamond trails, including one with a seriously steep 52-degree pitch. Today, Aspen Snowmass has 5,547 skiable acres served by 41 chairlifts. Sunlight has 680 acres, two double chairs and one triple. Aspen has twice the vertical drop, and its longest run, at 5.3 miles, is twice that of Sunlight's. Aspen evolved into a playground for the rich and famous. It is where Ivana Trump, while married to Donald J. Trump, had a public confrontation at the end of 1989 with his then-girlfriend, Marla Maples.

Aspen Skiing Company is even owned by billionaires: the Crown family, which also has stakes in the New York Yankees, the Chicago Bulls and Rockefeller Center, according to Forbes. Also privately held, a majority of Sunlight is controlled by two families, with a handful of others, mostly local residents, owning the rest. A decade ago, they listed the resort for sale for $50 million but could not find a buyer. In contrast, the publicly traded Vail Resorts Inc. spent $1.05 billion last year to buy Whistler Blackcomb in British Columbia, adding to its stable of ski resorts, which also includes Vail, Beaver Creek, Breckenridge and Keystone in Colorado, and eight others in the United States and Australia. Resigned to the fact that the big boys get most of the attention, Sunlight still could not resist taking a little dig at them with its $700 lift ticket, because, as Mr. Hawks said, ""sometimes our voice goes unheard."" But now, he said, ""We offer one of the most affordable ski days as well as the most expensive."" And the competition? Let's just say they are not feeling too threatened. Jeff Hanle, the public relations director for Aspen Snowmass, said, Sunlight's promotion ""is fun and a great way to bring some attention to the smaller unique resorts that are an integral part of the Colorado ski experience.""",The offering (it also includes really nice skis) is giving Sunlight some attention. Its other prices are gentler.,4614e20f-0e9c-5e8b-b93c-d419c5e6615e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/05/travel/05UPDATE/05UPDATE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=2463b87bbf2bdc4d1499be829979237515ba4dd7c7882d36430b1a065410cf15&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Sunlight Mountain Resort in Glenwood Springs has just three chairlifts.,4614e20f-0e9c-5e8b-b93c-d419c5e6615e,N24News/imgs/4614e20f-0e9c-5e8b-b93c-d419c5e6615e.jpg,4
Technology,Uber Claims to Have Changed. A London Judge Will Decide.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/24/technology/uber-london-appeal.html,"An anti-Uber billboard driven around London by the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association. Starting Monday, a judge will hear Uber's appeal of the loss of its operating license in the city.

LONDON -- Dara Khosrowshahi's 10-month tenure as Uber's chief executive has been marked by a prolonged public relations campaign to apologize for the company's past misdeeds and portray the once proudly combative start-up as a reformed corporate citizen. Starting Monday, a judge in London will test the success of his strategy. Uber this week begins an appeal to reverse a decision by the British capital's regulators to revoke its operating license. If it cannot make its case, that ruling could ultimately ban Uber cars from the city of 8.8 million, one of the company's most lucrative markets. Uber will argue that new policies installed under Mr. Khosrowshahi show a newfound willingness to address government concerns. The case before Westminster Magistrates' Court has ramifications far beyond London, and, given changes the city has already wrung from Uber, it could embolden others grappling with how to regulate ride-sharing services. The ruling will offer a hint as to whether governments and regulators are becoming more receptive to Mr. Khosrowshahi's conciliatory efforts as he seeks to move past the brusque manner associated with his predecessor, Travis Kalanick. ""The trial is one of the first big tests of Khosrowshahi's leadership of the company and new approach,"" said Andre Spicer, a professor at the Cass Business School at City, University of London, who has been tracking the case. ""The judgment will show whether authorities are willing to accept Uber with some of the harder edges knocked off, or whether there are more fundamental questions about the Uber model.""

Of all the issues that Mr. Khosrowshahi has confronted since taking over at Uber -- allegations of a sexist company culture, government investigations, management turnover, a data breach affecting millions of customers -- London's potential ban is one of the most pressing for the company's financial health. With more than 3.6 million people using Uber at least once every three months, and 45,000 drivers transporting them, the British capital is Uber's largest European market. The company has so far been able to continue operating pending its appeal. But a ban would be Uber's biggest regulatory setback to date. It would bruise its business at a critical time as Mr. Khosrowshahi is scaling back the company's operations in money-losing markets in Asia and laying the groundwork for an initial public offering. Mr. Khosrowshahi was less than a month into the job when London transport authorities revoked Uber's license in September. Regulators said Uber was not a ""fit and proper"" company, an important classification for businesses in Britain. They accused the ride-hailing service of having poor safety standards, of not conducting sufficient background checks on drivers and of using software to avoid government oversight.

A deal could not be reached at the time, but the trip provided an early opportunity to underline the need for change at Uber. In a letter to employees after the London license was revoked, Mr. Khosrowshahi said, ""There is a high cost for a bad reputation."" Uber has since tried to address many of the criticisms from the London authorities, and a deal of some sort is likely to be reached to keep the company's cars on the roads. It has introduced limits on how long a driver may continuously be behind the wheel, offered tools to report incidents to the police, and agreed to share traffic data with the city. A new management team was installed to run the company's London operations, while three independent executives were recruited to a board that oversees operations in Britain. The company is also seeking only an 18-month license, rather than the typical five years, as a concession that it says will allow regulators to ensure its reforms will last. The question is whether the steps go far enough. At a pretrial hearing, Senior District Judge Emma Arbuthnot, who is presiding over the appeal, asked whether the changes were a ""smoke screen."" London is not the only area where Uber has made changes under Mr. Khosrowshahi. The company has settled a protracted legal battle with Waymo, owned by the Google parent, Alphabet, over self-driving car technology. It has offered drivers new insurance protections in some markets, and it proposed a fee on ride-hailing services in New York to pay for a ""hardship fund"" for struggling taxi drivers. The trial beginning on Monday is expected to last several days, with testimony from Uber representatives and officials from Transport for London, the city's regulator. Mr. Khosrowshahi is not expected to attend.

The case could drag on for years. If Uber loses this appeal, it can still take the case to higher courts, and the company's cars would be allowed to remain on the road throughout the process. Uber and Transport for London declined to comment. London's actions are being closely watched as a potential model for regulators elsewhere who are seeking to extract concessions from Uber. Nine years after the company was founded, policymakers continue to struggle with fallout associated with the success of Uber and similar ride-hailing services, including more congested streets and devastated local taxi groups. In New York, where six taxi drivers have committed suicide in recent months, Mayor Bill de Blasio and the City Council are under pressure to adopt stricter rules against ride-hailing services. Uber has also faced restrictions in other American cities, such as Austin, Tex., and in countries like Canada, Denmark, France, Ireland and Italy.

Court rulings have also had a major impact on Uber's development. In a case in December, the European Union's highest court ruled that Uber was a transportation company, not just a digital platform, a decision that could force the company to meet tougher licensing and worker-benefit requirements. ""The wild-West era of platform companies skirting regulation seems to be coming to an end,"" said Mark Graham, a professor of internet geography at Oxford University who has studied how Uber and other companies that make up the so-called gig economy affect workers and traditional industries. A new license for Uber would be a blow to London's black-cab drivers. They argue that rivals working for Uber have an unfair advantage because they do not have to meet the same car specification requirements or pass an exhaustive exam, known as ""the Knowledge,"" that tests a cabby's ability to navigate city streets without a map. That, they say, allows Uber to keep its prices lower than those of black cabs -- Uber can be up to 30 percent cheaper than London taxis.","The ride-hailing company is appealing a ban in its largest European market.

Style,Modernist Magic in Indiana,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/01/arts/design/modernist-miller-house-columbus-indiana.html,"Credit...Kevin Miyazaki for The New York Times





Some home-building projects start with an itch for more space. Others with a love of customization. One house that lies low and lean across a bumpy patch of Indianapolis began with a run in the woods. For years, Bryan Chandler, the president of a commercial real estate firm and a runner, had cut across a parcel of land that was sliced by a creek and crowned by a 40-foot hill. In 2012, on one of his jaunts, he discovered that the property was for sale and bought it. But what to do with it? He and his wife, Mary, were living with their three children in a 1950s traditional-style home in Indianapolis. ""We weren't looking to move from the house where we had brought our kids home from the hospital,"" Ms. Chandler recalled. ""But we had talked for some time in an indefinite way about some day perhaps building a modern house.""

Among the houses that interested the Chandlers was the Millers' own residence, a flat-topped structure of steel, slate and glass completed in 1957 by the Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen. ""It helped us imagine how a family might live in a modern home,"" Mr. Chandler said. When the couple began looking for an architect, they asked a Cummins colleague who was knowledgeable about design for names. He gave them only one: Deborah Berke. A practitioner of emotionally intelligent minimalism who is also dean of Yale University's architecture school, Ms. Berke and her 2006 Irwin Union Bank branch figure into the plot of ""Columbus,"" a new feature film about the town and its accumulation of modernist architecture. This year, she completed the Cummins Distribution Headquarters, a mixed-use complex downtown.

Ms. Berke's design for the Chandlers evokes the Miller House's strategic, glass-walled transparency, its use of eloquent materials and its overhanging flat roof. Deborah Berke and her 2006 Irwin Union Bank branch figure into the plot of ""Columbus,"" a feature film about the town of Columbus, Ind., and its accumulation of modernist architecture. The 3,500-square-foot Chandler house, like the Miller House, has separate wings for parents and children, with a large, communal space in between. The kitchen has a showstopping blue ceramic tile wall that Ms. Berke called ""a tip of the hat"" to the Miller kitchen's wall of blue glass mosaic tile. Both houses follow a larger modernist agenda to dissolve the boundary between inside and outside, turn views into slowly transforming kinetic artworks and soothe as well as shelter. But however much the Chandlers admired the Miller House, ""they didn't want a copy of it, obviously,"" Ms. Berke said. What she offered was fitted to their needs and the remarkable site. Completed last fall for about $300 per square foot, the zinc-paneled structure with mahogany-framed windows sits at the top of the property. A curving driveway leads from the road through oak, sycamore, maple and walnut trees, and the land behind the building quickly drops down into a meadow. The centerpiece of the interior is a living/dining area with long stretches on either side of thermally efficient glass. This space is divided by a wall paneled in heart pinewood and a cubic space of the same material, in which the kitchen is tucked. Mr. Chandler obtained the wood from the beams of a dismantled 1900 baking powder factory in Terre Haute, Ind.

The house also has many small, private rooms. The Chandlers asked for his-and-her home offices and a bedroom and bathroom for each of their children, now ages 19, 18 and 14. ""We basically have the same space as the kids,"" Ms. Chandler said, noting that bathrooms are just large enough to ""maneuver in without hitting an elbow or a head"" and that televisions are banned from bedrooms, herding family members into the common areas.

The views change from room to room, grander in the public spaces and more tightly framed in private ones. They also change drastically from season to season. Indiana, Ms. Berke pointed out, oscillates between snow-carpeted panoramas and hot summer greenery. The perspectives exploit -- and the house is insulated against -- both extremes. Surrounding the building, beneath the roof overhang, is a landscaped area Ms. Berke calls ""the plinth."" Irregular in surface (some parts are paved in limestone, others planted with pachysandra, and a very small bit is consumed by an outdoor shower), the plinth slows and smooths the transition between interior and exterior. It is here, on a luxuriant terrace, that the family soaks up morning rays or watches deer emerge from the forest to graze in the evening. For Ms. Chandler, the primary mission was a visceral connection between the building, occupants and outdoors. ""And in fact that interaction -- the sunlight in the house, the doors that all open, the way that we walk in and out to the patio and look at the bald eagle that flies over the meadow -- is really the way that we live,"" she said.","An Indianapolis family with a historical connection to modern architecture found inspiration for their new home in a piece of land, a nearby town and an Eero Saarinen creation.",abc4fba0-c008-5dab-8b33-17984ec07faa,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/21/style/05BERKE1/05BERKE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=9f0ca6d7b403dd0e0ac931e628f9eaf9fa956d0399f4ebc32e032d5da34fa1b2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Chandler family's home in Indianapolis, designed by the architectural firm Deborah Berke Partners.

Science,Zika Was Soaring Across Cuba. Few Outside the Country Knew.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/science/cuba-zika-epidemic.html,"A previously unknown outbreak of the Zika virus swept across Cuba in 2017, a year after the global health emergency was declared over, scientists reported on Thursday. Until now, the Pan American Health Organization had no record of any Zika infection in Cuba in 2017, much less an outbreak. Following inquiries by The New York Times about the new study, published in the journal Cell, officials acknowledged that they had failed to tally 1,384 cases reported by Cuban officials that year. That figure is a sharp increase over the 187 cases confirmed in 2016 and is ""in line with the estimates for 2017 from our own study,"" said Kristian Andersen, an infectious disease researcher at Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, Calif., and a co-author of the new study. Because most cases of Zika go unconfirmed, Dr. Andersen added, the outbreak actually may have comprised tens of thousands of infections.

Cuba saw record tourism in 2017, raising the possibility that many travelers were unknowingly exposed. Some 4.7 million foreign visitors arrived that year, an increase of 16 percent over 2016. More than one million were Canadians. ""If we want to stay ahead of communicable diseases, we need to know where they are and how many cases are occurring,"" said Jennifer Gardy of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle. ""For some diseases in some settings, this is pretty straightforward. For others, like Zika, it isn't."" Officials at P.A.H.O., an arm of the World Health Organization, blamed the failure to publish timely data on the Cuba outbreak on a ""technical glitch."" The information was held in a database, they said, but not visible on the website. By Thursday afternoon, the website had been updated. Dr. Andersen and his colleagues began tracking Zika's spread when the mosquito-borne virus first appeared in the Americas in 2015. The epidemic first came to light in Brazil, where babies of some infected mothers were born with severe brain damage. The virus spread swiftly to neighboring countries. Dr. Andersen and his colleagues collected blood from people infected with the virus. The researchers plucked the virus's genetic material from the samples and used mutations in the DNA to estimate the timing of Zika's spread.

Before Zika was identified in Brazil, the scientists discovered, it had been quietly circulating in the country for over a year. ""And by that time, it had spread across all the Americas,"" Dr. Andersen said. Even in Florida, where the state government keeps careful tabs on new outbreaks, Zika arrived three months before it was detected, the scientists learned. In November 2016, the World Health Organization announced that the epidemic was no longer a global public health emergency. ""But we sat here with this question,"" Dr. Andersen recalled. ""Is it really over?"" [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The scientists continued tracking the Zika virus across the Americas. They reviewed data on local outbreaks that countries reported to P.A.H.O. They also tallied confirmed cases of Zika in travelers coming home to Florida. Across the Americas, both sets of statistics told the same story: The number of Zika cases crashed toward the end of 2016 and remained low afterward. But there was one glaring exception in the data. In 2016, only a few people returning to Florida from Cuba were infected with Zika. In 2017, however, Cuba accounted for 98 percent of the travel-associated Zika cases in Florida. This was an unexpected finding. Cuba has a sophisticated public health system, and it had seemed to be winning the war against Zika, apparently avoiding the outbreaks seen on other Caribbean islands.

To see if the initial results held up, Dr. Andersen and his colleagues turned to public health data in Europe and discovered a similar pattern among visitors to Cuba. The team developed a statistical model to predict the size of a Zika outbreak in a country, based on the number of travelers who went to Cuba and came back sick. They concluded that Cuba's outbreak in 2017 was ""the same size as on other Caribbean islands, meaning thousands of reported cases,"" Dr. Andersen said. But because reported cases typically comprise about 10 percent of a given outbreak, ""we're actually talking about tens of thousands of cases.""

The researchers also examined blood samples from travelers to Cuba to learn the history of the outbreak and determined that the virus appeared in Cuba in the summer of 2016. There was no Patient Zero; instead, Zika arrived several times from other islands. Then it smoldered, as it had elsewhere, for a year. Dr. Andersen suspects that Cuba's aggressive mosquito control and disease surveillance held back the virus while it raged elsewhere in 2016. Other mosquito-borne viruses, such as dengue, were also surging through the Caribbean, but Cuba didn't see many cases of those, either. But after the global emergency was called off, Zika gained momentum in Cuba in 2017, the researchers speculated. ""It is easy to miss an outbreak,"" said Dr. Ester Sabino, the director of the Institute of Tropical Medicine at the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, who was not involved in the new study. Many people infected with Zika don't feel any symptoms, while some suffer only a mild fever for a few days.","The mosquito-borne virus spread through the island in 2017, but global health officials failed to sound the alarm.",2eeef6fc-09c1-5d48-bc5b-75a5ef15ac95,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/22/science/22SCI-ZIKA1/22SCI-ZIKA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=274256b97cb69df7af0e3708e38a0a579465e214bf0adcafa5721171eba87b60&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A Cuban soldier fumigated a home against mosquitoes in Havana in February 2016.,2eeef6fc-09c1-5d48-bc5b-75a5ef15ac95,N24News/imgs/2eeef6fc-09c1-5d48-bc5b-75a5ef15ac95.jpg,2
Television,9 Times Big Bird Helped Us Be Better People,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/09/arts/television/big-bird-caroll-spinney.html,"Who among us didn't learn something from Caroll Spinney's Big Bird over the years? Spinney, who for decades brought the Gentle Giant to life (and also Oscar the Grouch), died on Sunday, but the lessons he shared live on with the millions of people who grew up watching ""Sesame Street."" Beyond alphabet recitals and numerical countdowns, everybody's favorite feathered friend had valuable things to say to both children and grown-ups about the value of cooperation and the best ways to navigate complex emotions. Life can be tough, he told us, but it's going to be all right. Here are a few of the tricky topics Big Bird broke down for viewers young and old.

Flightless Big Bird felt insecure about himself after reading about ""another bird"" -- the pioneering aviator Admiral Richard E. Byrd, who was the first to fly to the South Pole and back. What could Big Bird possibly do that might compare? ""All I ever do is just sit here and play jacks and eat birdseed. And I'm never the first anywhere."" Diana Ross helped boost Big Bird's confidence during her Season 13 guest spot when she sang ""Believe in Yourself,"" advising him to swap ""I can"" for ""I can't.""

Big Bird always encouraged kids to eat the fruits and vegetables they're often eager to avoid. In Season 29, he shopped at the Union Square farmers market and visited an upstate farm called Blooming Hill, where he marveled at all the fresh produce. Big Bird also teamed up with a pair of First Ladies to promote healthy eating -- Hillary Clinton in Season 25 and Michelle Obama in Season 40. ""Broccoli! Yum, yum, yum, yum,"" Big Bird said, making dinner time a tad easier for parents around the country. As part of the ""Eat Brighter"" campaign, Big Bird teamed with Obama and Billy Eichner on an odd (but Emmy-nominated) segment of ""Billy on the Street,"" where they played a grocery store game called ""Ariana Grande or Eating a Carrot?"" (As in, which is better? Answer: the carrot, of course.)

For the very young, healthy eating can mean breastfeeding, which Big Bird did a lot to help normalize. When the cast member Buffy Sainte-Marie welcomed her son Dakota to the show, it gave her a chance to teach Big Bird how to deal with his jealousy that the baby was receiving more attention than he did, and to explain different kinds of love. (""Different People, Different Ways."") She also demonstrated that nursing her infant was perfectly natural. ""See, he's drinking milk from my breast,"" she told the curious bird. ""Lots of mothers feed their babies this way. Not all mothers, but lots of mothers do."" Out in the real world, everyday moms were still being humiliated and shamed for nursing in public, so it meant a lot for Big Bird to see and accept it back in 1977. ""You know, that's nice,"" he said. (In 2012, thousands of parents petitioned for ""Sesame Street"" to feature more breastfeeding.)

Big Bird had a tough time getting grown-ups to believe him. They dismissed his super-reclusive pal Mr. Snuffleupagus as an imaginary friend -- or maybe even an elaborate lie. And after 14 seasons, Big Bird's insistence otherwise was beginning to call his general credibility into question. One grown-up did believe his stories -- Mister Rogers, during a crossover episode in Season 12. But was it too late? Even Mr. Snuffleupagus was a skeptic, doubting Big Bird several times. (""Et tu, Snuffy?"" Big Bird moaned). It all made Big Bird question his ability to distinguish fantasy from reality. Finally, though, inspired by a string of high-profile (but ultimately problematic) child sex abuse cases, ""Sesame Street"" allowed Big Bird to rally support for his claims in Season 16 and prove them in Season 17 -- showing kids that grown-ups would believe them when they actually did tell the truth. Big Bird always enjoyed friendly competition, but was never sure if he should be happy when he won if someone else had to lose. After a footrace with Mr. Snuffleupagus, for example, he said, ""He's going to be sad he didn't win, and he might even be angry because I beat him."" (Fortunately, Mister Rogers was still on hand, and helped Big Bird realize that he could be a gracious winner and still let his friend know that he cared about his feelings.) Many years later, Big Bird competed against Jason Schwartzman on ""Lip Sync Battle,"" and when he won the round, asked the host LL Cool J to make it a tie. ""I know you said that you can't have two winners, there could only be one, but couldn't just this once, couldn't we change the rules?""

Big Bird had his share of minor accidents -- that's the point of ""Everybody Makes Mistakes."" But in Season 32, over the course of five episodes, Big Bird had to deal with the wreckage of his nest by a hurricane. (""My home, my nest, my everything!"") The grown-ups pitch in to restore his modest digs -- a process only made possible through friendship and cooperation. When the job is done, Big Bird is deeply grateful for all their help and tells them so (""I Want to Thank You for Being My Friends""). The lesson: Disasters will sometimes happen, but possessions are replaceable -- people are not. Big Bird is no stranger to nightmares, and he suffered a big one during a sleepover with Gabi in Season 27. But he also got a fright when Gabi hid under the blanket and was making ""Wubba wubba"" noises -- a sound usually uttered by ""Sesame Street"" monsters. When he realized that it was only Gabi, Big Bird asked her to do it again, ""because sometimes it's fun to be scared.""

When the actor Will Lee, who played the grocer Mr. Hooper, died in 1982, ""Sesame Street"" was unsure how to deal with his loss. Should the story line have his character retire to Florida? Instead, his absence became a lesson for Big Bird -- and the children watching -- about understanding death and dealing with grief. After consulting with child psychologists, the show decided on a direct approach, and the result was the first ""Sesame Street"" episode to treat a difficult topic in a profound but age-appropriate way. Big Bird had to process an array of conflicting feelings -- shock, confusion, frustration, regret, anger. Big Bird's portrait of Mr. Hooper still hangs on the wall, even though an art dealer offered to buy it in a later episode. Out in the real world, Big Bird expressed his grief over the death of the Muppet master Jim Henson by singing at his memorial service, a moving way to send off his very best friend.","Caroll Spinney, who portrayed Big Bird for decades, died on Sunday. But the lessons he shared on ""Sesame Street"" live on.",2b7feb36-a4af-56d2-8351-5add28f56beb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/09/arts/09bigbird/09bigbird-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=739506e3fce71552bf28678f2ba8eeafffecbe6e7b92a21d2c9a42110de1c2a3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Caroll Spinney as Big Bird during a 2008 taping of ""Sesame Street.""",2b7feb36-a4af-56d2-8351-5add28f56beb,N24News/imgs/2b7feb36-a4af-56d2-8351-5add28f56beb.jpg,3
Travel,Expedia Supports Lawsuit Against Trump's Immigration Ban,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/travel/expedia-dara-khosrowshahi-lawsuit-against-trump-immigration-ban.html,"On Sunday, the chief executive of Expedia Inc., Dara Khosrowshahi, an Iranian immigrant, sent an email to the company's employees condemning President Trump's executive order banning people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. On Monday, the company -- which is based in Bellevue, Wash., and is the world's largest online travel firm, with more than $72 billion a year in annual bookings across its 30 brands -- filed a declaration as part of Washington State's lawsuit against the president. (Amazon did the same.) Mr. Khosrowshahi said 1,000 Expedia customers were affected by the ban. The state's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, announced the suit earlier that day, making Washington the first state to take action against the executive order. In a news conference, Mr. Ferguson said that he was suing the president over the ban; the lawsuit, which also names the Department of Homeland Security and top Trump administration officials, asks for a temporary restraining order against enforcement of the ban. Expedia's declaration, filed by the company's general counsel, Robert Dzielak, outlines the damage the ban could have on the company and on the travel industry as a whole.

""Expedia believes that the executive order jeopardizes its corporate mission and could have a detrimental impact on its business and employees, as well as the broader U.S. and global travel and tourism industry,"" the company said. In a telephone interview on Tuesday, Mr. Khosrowshahi, who is a member of the board of directors of The New York Times, spoke about the declaration. Edited excerpts are below. Q. How did Expedia get involved with the lawsuit? A. The State of Washington let us know on Sunday that the suit was something they were considering and asked for our support. We are generally not aggressive against issues that do not relate to our company, but this is travel, our soul and spirit, and we felt we had to respond. Honestly, it was not a debate whether we should we be involved. How will a temporary restraining order against the ban, as requested by the State of Washington, help Expedia? The declaration is about helping our employees and the 1,000 or so Expedia travelers who are currently affected by the ban. Internally, the order has raised a fair amount of anxiety among our employees about where they can travel. We are a United States-based company but a global brand, and we have people flying to Asia, Europe and other parts of the world to do their jobs. Also, although we recruit talent from the United States to join Expedia, we also look for talent from around the world, and the ban makes it more difficult to recruit employees from the seven countries that are part of the ban.

Can you explain what it entails to help the 1,000 Expedia customers who are affected by the ban and what the financial cost is to do so? We do not have a financial estimate at this point, but we are trying to help them by contacting them and getting clarity on their situation. If they can't or don't want to complete their travel, we help them make alternate plans and incur the costs of those plans. We have seen the travel industry come together on this ban -- all of our supply partners have been as flexible as they can be to help those impacted. Of the seven countries included in the ban, Iran, where you are from, has become a more popular tourist destination for United States citizens in the last year. Given the ban, do you expect that will change? I think it is bound to have an impact on the Iranian tourism industry. I have not been back to Iran since my family left in 1978, but I have a cousin who recently went with his family, and I can tell you that it is a wonderful place to visit with welcoming people and great food. Expedia aside, how will the ban hurt the travel industry as a whole? I think, in general, uncertain times such as terrorist attacks and wars hurt travel, so travel may become more subdued. But, on the other hand, people want to travel and explore different cultures, so it will ultimately come back. Do you think that the ban will affect international tourism to the United States? That certainly is a danger. As the perception of the United States as a welcoming place for all changes among travelers globally, the country's tourism market, which is a huge revenue generator for the economy, could get hurt. In your opinion, will United States passport holders be subject to greater scrutiny as they travel globally? I think it is tough to tell. Having a United States passport has been an incredible asset, and I hope that will continue to be the case.","Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of the company, said 1,000 of its customers were affected by the ban.",0e328cc9-4f41-5e5d-b3f7-fe1d72d2ef90,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/31/travel/31EXPEDIA/31EXPEDIA-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=fec27903212663e05b3f35da28faebdabba2d0a324daa05079087baa7cc5f44e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Expedia, said 1,000 customers were affected by the immigration ban.",0e328cc9-4f41-5e5d-b3f7-fe1d72d2ef90,N24News/imgs/0e328cc9-4f41-5e5d-b3f7-fe1d72d2ef90.jpg,4
Media,Thomas Barrack's Colony Capital Ends Bid for Weinstein Studio,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/business/media/weinstein-studio-colony-capital.html,"But Colony found more disorder than it had expected -- and less value -- once it started closely examining the studio. By Oct. 26, a preliminary agreement for Colony to give the Weinstein Company an immediate cash infusion had fallen apart, even as Colony continued to evaluate the possible purchase of some or all of the studio.

By Tuesday, the acquisition effort had also broken down, in part because of Colony's desire to structure any purchase in a way that would not enrich Mr. Weinstein, according to the people briefed on the matter. Mr. Weinstein, who has denied ""any allegations of nonconsensual sex,"" was fired by the Weinstein Company on Oct. 8 but retains a roughly 20 percent ownership stake in the studio.

A spokesman for the Weinstein Company did not respond to requests for comment.

While many television and film partners have cut ties with the Weinstein Company, the studio still has several movies planned for release and a handful of television shows in production, including ""Project Runway."" But the studio, which has about 150 employees, needs a financial lifeline to keep operating.

Executives at the Weinstein Company have been talking to Fortress Investment Group, a private equity firm, about a potential financing package for the studio valued at roughly $35 million, which would provide enough liquidity for the studio to operate roughly through January. A Fortress spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.

Also on Tuesday, Debtwire, a subscription-only news service for debt-market traders, reported that Weinstein Company lenders had hired the law firm Sidley Austin to advise on a possible bankruptcy filing.",Talks broke down after the private equity firm took a closer look.,85d82bba-f026-5f66-9f08-f0b56e61e711,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/08/business/08COLONY1/08COLONY1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=758fd39b76fab00a471ef1f3a717fc6e41edf73913c89ecf91f8425585386dad&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Harvey Weinstein, left, with Thomas J.

 DRIVE-BY TRUCKERS at Brooklyn Bowl (through June 29, 8 p.m.). Politics and contemporary country music have an uneasy relationship, to say the least -- artists inclined to speak their conscience often do so at the risk of being ostracized by the genre's radio gatekeepers. This alt-country group from Athens, Ga., has long bucked the expectation of apoliticism, but never more willfully than on their most recent album, 2016's ""American Band."" Its songs, like ""What It Means"" and ""Ever South,"" address topics such as gun violence and immigration. This weekend, they will close out a six-night run at this concert hall in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

On ""Active Listening: Night on Earth"" -- their debut album, released in May on the queer-forward punk label Get Better Records -- the group splices pop hooks with hardcore fervor and New Agey embellishments, to delightful ends. Their appearance at this art space in Red Hook, Brooklyn, is copresented by The Baffler and will kick off Press Play, a two-day book and music fair. Empath will be joined by their label mates Control Top, a postpunk trio.

LIZ PHAIR at Prospect Park Bandshell (June 29, 7 p.m.). In the mid-90s, this renowned singer-songwriter became, as she told The New York Times last year, an ""accidental feminist spokesperson."" That was due to the release of ""Exile in Guyville,"" a collection of scrappy guitar songs noted for what was then considered a brazen expression of sexuality and its condemnation of male apathy, penned in response to the Rolling Stones' ""Exile on Main Street."" More than a quarter-century later, Phair's influence is manifest in young artists like Soccer Mommy and Lindsey Jordan (Snail Mail), who once played in a Phair cover band. In Prospect Park, she appears alongside the punk shape-shifter Ted Leo and the wry songwriter Caroline Rose.

Though all five members of this Brooklyn-based group are under 30, they've been playing together for more than a decade. Since forming in 2008, the band has gone through lineup changes and lulls, and several members have explored side projects; still, their chemistry is stronger than ever on ""mo'za-ik,"" their sixth album, released in October. The record traverses dreamy R&B (""Way Too Far""), playful hip-hop (""Before You Get a Boyfriend"") and politically charged soul (""on everythinG iii love""). Expect them to play selections from the album during their two-night stand at this club on the Lower East Side. Saturday night's performance is sold out, but tickets remain for Sunday.

Hailing from nearby New Brunswick, N.J., this experimental rock band has been a commanding presence in alternative music circles. Fourteen years after their founding and long after graduating to bigger stages, they retain the punk ethos of a group that came up through basements and other D.I.Y. hot spots. For this show, presented by City Farm as part of its summer series, they will be joined by Swearin', the band fronted by Allison Crutchfield and Kyle Gilbride.

OLIVIA HORN

STANLEY COWELL at Smoke (June 28-29, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). Cowell can make the piano dance by playing in a jaggy rhythm, or simply by manipulating the tone of his harmonies, or by throwing his right and left hands into a thrashing repartee. This weekend run is billed as a look back at his 60-year career, and there's a lot to celebrate: He came into the jazz consciousness in the 1960s, turning heads with his idiosyncratic style and bold compositional voice; co-founded the influential, independent label Strata-East; and has continued expanding ever since, composing short pieces and long suites, and sometimes experimenting with electronics. Joining him at Smoke are the trumpeter Freddie Hendrix, the saxophonist and flutist Bruce Williams, the bassist Tom DiCarlo and the drummer Vince Ector. 

212-864-6662, smokejazz.com JEROME HARRIS QUARTET at Bar Lunatico (July 1, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). For much of the 1980s and '90s, Harris served as the guitarist in Sonny Rollins's band, while also establishing himself as a mainstay of New York's improvising avant-garde. Harris -- who doubles on bass and has conducted scholarly inquiries into some remote corners of the black-music lineage -- draws no clear lines of demarcation between African song, mainstream jazz and the avant-garde. He is most often heard as a side musician, but at Lunatico he'll lead a group featuring Jeremy Udden on alto sax, Dave Baron on bass and Lucianna Padmore on drums, with Harris handling guitar and vocals.

 WADADA LEO SMITH at the Stone (through June 29, 8:30 p.m.). This inimitable trumpeter is in the midst of an extended late-career boom, putting out mind-altering material at a rapid clip, in a range of formats. In all his work, what stays constant is the heavy, sighing power of Smith's expression -- a physical and calming force, speaking of poise and forbearance -- as well as restless vision. His residency at the Stone this week presents a chance to hear a number of his projects over the span of a few days. On Thursday he performs a tribute to the drummer Ed Blackwell, in duet with Pheeroan akLaff, on Friday he presents his composition ""Red Autumn Gold/Silence,"" joined by two cellists and two pianists, and on Saturday he appears with an eight-piece electroacoustic ensemble, playing a piece titled ""Ritual Light, a Cosmic Luminous Wave-Field.""

Health,Bulwark Against an Abortion Ban? Medical Advances,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/01/science/abortion-supreme-court-trump.html,"As partisans on both sides of the abortion divide contemplate a Supreme Court with two Trump appointees, one thing is certain: America even without legal abortion would be very different from America before abortion was legal. The moment Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced his retirement, speculation swirled that Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion, would be overturned. Most legal experts say that day is years away, if it arrives at all. A more likely scenario, they predict, is that a rightward-shifting court would uphold efforts to restrict abortion, which would encourage some states to further limit access. Even then, a full-fledged return to an era of back-alley, coat-hanger abortions seems improbable. In the decades since Roe was decided, a burst of scientific innovation has produced more effective, simpler and safer ways to prevent pregnancies and to stop them after conception -- advances that have contributed to an abortion rate that has already plunged by half since the 1980s. ""We're in a new world now,"" said Aziza Ahmed, a law professor at Northeastern University who writes about reproductive rights law. ""The majority of American women are on some form of contraception. We take it for granted that we can control when and how we want to reproduce. We see pregnancy as within the realm that we can control.""

Women have powerful tools at hand: improved intrauterine devices and hormonal implants that can prevent pregnancy for years at a time; inexpensive home pregnancy tests able to detect pregnancy very early; and morning-after pills, some even available over the counter, which can prevent pregnancy if taken up to five days after unprotected sex. Medication abortions enable women up to 10 weeks pregnant to take two pills, the first supervised by a doctor and the second at home, to terminate a pregnancy without surgery. In 2013, nearly a quarter of abortions were accomplished with medication, up from 10 percent in 2004. Even in countries that have banned virtually all abortions, including some in Latin America, women have managed to get these drugs from websites and abortion rights organizations that ship them. And the Affordable Care Act, which has so far defied repeated repeal attempts, has made birth control available to poor and working-class women, and also to those with private coverage through employers, with its requirement that most insurers cover the full cost of contraception. Apps and telemedicine services are making birth control pills and other methods available without even a visit to a doctor. Still, legal changes that make abortion less available would have profound effects on millions of women, disproportionately affecting African-Americans, Latinas and women struggling economically. And access to contraception can be problematic for low-income single women in the 19 states, including Texas and Florida, that have still not expanded Medicaid coverage for poor single adults.

A report this year by a committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine found that three-quarters of women who have abortions are poor or low-income, and 61 percent are women of color. Such women bear the brunt of state laws that restrict abortion, including those requiring multiple appointments or waiting periods or that limit which providers can perform abortions. Such hurdles and delays could eventually threaten the consistently high level of safety in abortion procedures, experts said. ""We found that more and more regulations on abortion and abortion procedures reduced the quality of care,"" said the committee's co-chairwoman, Dr. Helene Gayle, president and chief executive of the Chicago Community Trust. ""The people most impacted are the immigrant women already under siege, low-income women, women of color, transgender and queer women,"" said Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, executive director of the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, which works with women in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. ""Having a Supreme Court friendly to these restrictive laws makes it a de facto ban on that kind of health care, abortion and contraception. Legal access without real access is not access at all."" In some states, though, the impact of anti-abortion laws can be hard to measure. A recent report on 2014 data by the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights, found that while the national abortion rate had reached its lowest since the Roe v. Wade decision, the rate rose modestly in six states -- five of which had introduced restrictive abortion laws. The report also found that in states where the number of abortion clinics had increased, women were not necessarily having more abortions. New Jersey went from having 24 clinics in 2011 to 41 in 2014, but abortions declined from about 47,000 to about 44,000 during that time. Overall, abortion rates have declined almost steadily since 1981, when the rate was 29.3 per 1,000 women. In 2014, there were an estimated 926,200 abortions -- a rate of 14.6 per 1,000 women, ages 15 to 44.

The so-called Comstock obscenity laws, passed from 1873 through the early 1900s, made it illegal to give, sell, mail or transport any item used for contraception or abortion. After that, ""Margaret Sanger built a movement by compromising,"" Dr. Gordon said. ""They would campaign for legalization of contraception but not abortion."" Even after the birth control pill went on the market in 1960, contraceptives were only provided to women who were married. ""When I was in college, there was a wedding ring that was shared among young women when they wanted to see a doctor to get contraception,"" Dr. Gordon said. Abortions were often arranged through networks of clergy or women who helped people find, travel to and pay for providers.

Johanna Schoen, a professor at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., who specializes in the history of women's reproductive health, said the fate and rate of abortion will be intertwined with the availability of contraception, and whether anti-abortion political forces also take aim at birth control. Professor Schoen said many European countries have low abortion rates because birth control and sex education are widely available. ""But in the United States, the same people who are trying to restrict abortions have tried to restrict contraception, too."" Carol Sanger, who teaches reproductive rights at Columbia Law School, predicts that the Supreme Court won't overrule Roe v. Wade anytime soon. Developing a case that would be a direct assault takes years, she said. ""You don't say, 'Kennedy's out, Roe's overturned,'"" Ms. Sanger said. The doctrine of precedent, known as stare decisis, ""to stand by things decided,"" is sturdy. Circumstances must be extraordinary, a law unworkable, for a court to overrule itself, Ms. Sanger said. ""It stands for the idea that the substance of our law doesn't blow back and forth just because we get a new administration."" Another reason Roe v. Wade may not be struck down? ""You can do a heck of a lot of damage without overturning it,"" she said.

Among such initiatives, said Susan Swayze Liebel of the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion organization, ""fetal pain"" laws have become a ""top priority."" Some 20 states have enacted these laws, which assert that a fetus can feel pain at 20 weeks after conception -- a claim refuted by most medical experts. Roe barred most legal restrictions on abortions until fetuses were considered able to survive outside the womb, believed then to be 24 weeks after a woman's last menstrual period (about 22 weeks after conception). These laws seek to shorten abortion deadlines by two weeks, and while more than 90 percent of abortions occur much earlier, in the first trimester, fetal pain laws serve as potent political rallying cries. Numerous lawsuits about abortion restrictions are currently in state and federal courts, primed to wound Roe with a thousand cuts. Like the fetal pain laws, the intention of one such category is to roll back viability dates, which goes to the heart of Roe. Iowa just enacted a law banning most abortions after six weeks, when a fetal heartbeat can be detected. Mississippi recently passed a ban on abortions after 15 weeks. Abortion providers swiftly sued after the laws were passed. Legislators who sponsored the laws said they relished such court clashes, hoping to reach the Supreme Court. Another category is TRAP laws: targeted regulation of abortion providers. An Arkansas law, for example, requires providers of medication abortions to have a contract with an obstetrician/gynecologist with hospital admitting privileges. The Supreme Court declined to consider an appeal by the plaintiffs, Planned Parenthood of Arkansas and Eastern Oklahoma, of an appellate court ruling that upheld the law. The clinics say finding such doctors who will work with them has been impossible. The case is back in federal court, where a judge has blocked the law until July 2. If the law takes effect, Arkansas will likely lose two of its three clinics. Another cluster of laws aims to limit abortions based on possible reasons for having them, including sex selection and fetal diagnoses of conditions such as Down syndrome. Indiana's version, signed by then-Governor Mike Pence in 2016, was recently struck down by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, 2-1. As abortion court battles unfold, both sides say they will redouble their political efforts. Noting that the Senate this year did not pass a 20-week abortion ban, Mrs. Liebel of Susan B. Anthony's List said, ""The focus for our political activity is to go door-to-door in seven states and flip some key Senate seats to be pro-life."" And Nancy Northup, president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which focuses on laws concerning reproductive freedom, noted that some eight states have enshrined the right to abortion, should Roe fall. ""So we are also looking at advocacy alternatives, such as friendlier state laws and federal legislation to protect women's health,"" she said.",Improved contraception and abortion pills mean the back-alley days are largely gone. But more restrictive abortion laws would especially affect poor and minority women.,d738318e-e996-530e-a2c0-07d0d228d946,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/02/science/02-jp-abortion-print/00ABORTION1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=6310b0ae12a89321851761265b4968653363f88f20ee91e76b15bae884dda816&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A march in Washington of women demanding legalization of abortion in 1971.

Well,"Karen Pence Picks a Cause, and Art Therapists Feel Angst",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/well/mind/karen-pence-picks-a-cause-and-art-therapists-feel-angst.html,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- For much of her childhood, RyAnn Watson has been hospitalized for excruciating flare-ups of sickle cell disease. Now 16, she takes refuge from her pain in an art studio at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital. On a recent Friday, she was sketching the sandstone towers of the Smithsonian castle with a burnt-red coloring pen, under the watch of her therapist, Tracy Councill. ""It's more about putting my emotions into the artwork than telling someone about it and making myself upset,"" RyAnn said. Without any ""pressure to spill the beans,"" she said, ""I end up talking to Tracy about everything, once I'm drawing."" Although art therapy is offered by a number of established medical centers, many Americans don't know much about it. Art therapy is a form of psychotherapy where mental health professionals use art materials to help patients explore feelings that may not be easy to express in words. Almost overnight, the field has attracted new attention because of a connection with the Trump administration. On Inauguration Day, Karen Pence announced on the newly revamped White House website that she wants to shine a ""spotlight on the mental health profession of art therapy."" Mrs. Pence, a watercolorist herself, has been a board member of the art therapy program Tracy's Kids since 2011, and helped raise funds to hire two full-time art therapists for patients at Riley Hospital for Children in her native Indiana.

""I want to get more people aware of art therapy, not only for children who are going through an illness, but adults as well who have gone through trauma,"" Mrs. Pence said in a phone interview. Such attention from the wife of the vice president of the United States normally would be a boon to any profession, but these are not normal times. Some art therapists were thrilled that Mrs. Pence chose their underappreciated occupation as her signature cause. The American Art Therapy Association announced in its newsletter that it was ""enthusiastic about Mrs. Pence's commitment"" and eager to support her efforts.

""It's a breath of fresh air that someone in such a position can highlight our profession and can bring attention that's needed and well deserved,"" said Irene David, a pioneer of the field and the longtime director of therapeutic arts at NYC Health and Hospitals/Bellevue in Manhattan. But many art therapists held a different view. On social media, some art therapists argued that the policies supported by President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence are largely at odds with the group's principles and hurt the very people the profession treats, such as immigrants and trauma survivors.

Kate Broitman, an art therapist in Chicago, started a Facebook page called Art Therapists for Human Rights to organize with other art therapists who ""felt that great harm might come to our field, our clients and our work, if the association were to enter into a dialogue with Karen Pence."" The group had about 615 members as of Monday. ""There is a real divisiveness right now between art therapists,"" said Savneet Talwar, an associate professor of art therapy at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, who also works with Bosnian refugees. One side is ""for utilizing this opportunity to bring more visibility to art therapy,"" she said. On the other side, Dr. Talwar said, people say ""aligning yourself with her means you're not being true to our ethical principles."" Ms. Broitman said her clients in Chicago are worried they may lose their health insurance or be deported as a result of the policies supported by the vice president. ""You can't shine a spotlight on art therapy without being accountable to the real danger our clients currently face,"" she said. Asked to comment on the schism, Kara Brooks, the communications director for Mrs. Pence, said in an email that Mrs. Pence ""has been a champion for art therapy for many years."" ""She has a true appreciation for all those who work in this mental health profession,"" Ms. Brooks said. ""Mrs. Pence's efforts to bring awareness to art therapy over the years show that she really wants to make a positive difference.""

Most states don't offer licenses to art therapists, meaning they can't bill insurance. Often, private donors fund art therapists in states without licensure so they can work in schools, mental health clinics or hospitals. The profession also receives support from the National Endowment for the Arts, an organization that may face additional cuts under the Trump administration. Funds from the N.E.A. and the Department of Defense pay for a prominent program called Creative Forces, which offers art therapy to soldiers and veterans coping with post-traumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injuries. ""We know how valuable it is. Now it's a matter of carrying out the studies to further the evidence of value,"" said Dr. Sara Kass, a retired Navy captain who is trained as a family physician, who had planned to have the program at a dozen military sites by year's end. That said, Dr. Kass is concerned their funding will dry up. ""I think we stand to lose a valuable tool,"" she said. Despite threats that members will quit, the leaders of the art therapy association still are open to working with Mrs. Pence. ""If Mrs. Pence asks for and wants our support -- which she hasn't yet -- of course, we are going to offer support and resources,"" said Cynthia Woodruff, the executive director. One of the biggest boons from Mrs. Pence's support could be additional public and private funding for research. In a 2015 systematic review, the research arm of Britain's National Health Service gave art therapy mixed results. It found that 10 out of 15 randomized trials show benefit to patients, but that overall, the quality of the research was low. The studies reviewed included adults and children with depression, cancer, sickle cell disease and post-traumatic stress disorder.

""The big problem with all of this is there's no real, well-designed studies to show art therapy helps with people's cognition or general well-being,"" he said. After Sonali Agrawal, of Washington, D.C., was given a diagnosis of leukemia at age 4 in 2012, she regularly went to Ms. Councill's studio for years. As she had some of her chemotherapy infusions, she made a clay colander and a bird's nest. ""Sonali made a lot of pieces of art in which she was caring for an animal and keeping an animal safe,"" said Ms. Councill, founder of Tracy's Kids, which has outposts in Washington, San Antonio, Baltimore and New York. ""That had a lot to do with her wanting to feel safe."" Sonali's father, Dr. Manish Agrawal, an oncologist himself, thought it was ""crazy to think she looked forward to coming to the hospital to get chemo."" But she did. After watching his daughter's treatment with art therapy, Dr. Agrawal said he felt the need to change how he practiced medicine. ""We are so cut and dry,"" he said of doctors, but ""there's a huge emotional toll. There's real suffering."" Dr. Agrawal conceded that he is not a Trump supporter, but Mrs. Pence's support for art therapy, he said, ""may be the silver lining.""",Some therapists were thrilled that the the wife of the vice president supports their field. Others worry that her husband's politics hurt the very people they treat.,34404e85-4488-5666-956c-be4c7dc6f2b6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/06/science/06ART2/06ART2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=499ad075901bb1ea121ae8e61feafae2a723f4fbf61f7813fb4bae7571e55ae7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"RyAnn Watson, 16, sketches during an art therapy session at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital to help her cope with the pain of sickle cell disease.",34404e85-4488-5666-956c-be4c7dc6f2b6,N24News/imgs/34404e85-4488-5666-956c-be4c7dc6f2b6.jpg,18

Movies,Susan Sontag's Mind Games,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/movies/duet-for-cannibals-susan-sontag.html,"The 1969 New York Film Festival was the first to feature four movies directed by women and three made in Swedish. Susan Sontag's ""Duet for Cannibals,"" which she wrote and directed, fit both categories. Given the chance to make her debut film in the land of the reigning cinematic genius Ingmar Bergman, Sontag seized the opportunity to direct in a foreign language while supplying her own English subtitles. In those days her name was synonymous with zeitgeist .

""Duet for Cannibals,"" d igitally restored and revived at Metrograph, was trendy in other ways. While the festival blurb compared the movie to Hitchcock, its premise -- pitting a conspiratorial older couple against a naive younger pair -- was more suggestive of Edward Albee's ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,"" if not the spouse-swapping comedy, ""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice,"" that opened the festival.

Sontag once accused Albee of ""sensationalism masking as cultural expose."" ""Duet for Cannibals,"" which inspired ambivalent reviews in The New York Times and contentious letters to the editor, is open to the same characterization although it is more of a social critique rendered fashionably lurid. For all its psychosexual shenanigans, the movie -- shot in mid-1968, several months after Sontag returned from a trip to Hanoi -- does have a political point, dramatizing t he failure of revolution in the light of the so-called generation gap .","The author and public intellectual wrestled with a new medium and a foreign language in her now restored first feature, ""Duet for Cannibals,"" a dry comedy made in Sweden.",7865fb08-2fac-51e9-b140-518125c52c87,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/22/arts/21rewind/merlin_164629809_c41e3e9f-ed0f-47c6-98c7-1b08c2df5925-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=02a3278bc2e48f52af21b7c33141d150d2fd88ead7c23df667701a15551d14c6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Gosta Ekman, left, and Agneta Ekmanner in the film &ldquo;Duet for Cannibals, written and directed by Susan Sontag.",7865fb08-2fac-51e9-b140-518125c52c87,N24News/imgs/7865fb08-2fac-51e9-b140-518125c52c87.jpg,5
Real Estate,A New 25-Story Tower on City Hall Park,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/realestate/a-new-25-story-tower-on-city-hall-park.html,"A rendering of One Beekman, which is being built on a site that used to be part of J&R Music and Computer World.

For his firm's first residential building in the United States, the London-based architect Richard Rogers began with a difficult, oddly proportioned site -- a kite-shaped piece of land in the Financial District of Manhattan, right across from City Hall Park. Mr. Rogers, who won the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 2007 and is best known for buildings with exposed structural members and systems, such as the Centre Pompidou in Paris (with Renzo Piano) and Lloyd's of London, relished the challenge. ""I love constraints,"" he said during a recent visit to New York. ""One thing I hate is the idea of a white piece of paper,"" where there are no problems to solve.

The site, where Park Row and Theatre Alley intersect with Beekman Street, was previously home to part of J&R Music and Computer World, and one of its most desirable features was its wide-open view of City Hall Park to the north. (Mr. Rogers' other project in the neighborhood, 3 World Trade Center, is just a few blocks away.)

Making the most of that view became a driving objective in the design of One Beekman, a 25-story building with 31 condo units being developed by Urban Muse. Mr. Rogers' firm, Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, devised a building that provides sightlines north to the park from every apartment by shifting the circulation core to the south, where the building is hemmed in by its neighbors. ""We pulled the core right to the back, where there isn't any view, and made the building very solid there,"" said Graham Stirk, the firm's senior partner leading the design, while pushing all the living rooms toward the park. To the southwest, the building essentially turns its back on 25 Park Row, a new condo tower designed by CookFox Architects rising directly next door.

But to the north, ""the front of the building opens up like a flower,"" with walls of windows framed by anthracite-hued aluminum and perforated copper screens, said Glauco Lolli-Ghetti, the principal of Urban Muse. About half of the units have outdoor loggias or terraces facing the park, reached through sliding glass doors. The design at the front riffs on the cast-iron architecture of SoHo, said Mr. Stirk. ""It's not curtain wall,"" he noted. ""There's a richness to the surface depth."" The warm hue of the copper, meanwhile, is meant to pick up on the color of neighboring buildings, like the red brick and terra cotta of the Beekman hotel. Inside the apartments, there is six-inch-wide white oak plank flooring; custom white oak cabinets, Tundra Grey marble and Miele appliances in the kitchen; and bookmatched Montclair Danby marble in the master bathrooms and powder rooms. The building includes retail space on the first two floors, and office space on the third and fourth floors. The fifth floor houses the condominium's amenity spaces, including a gym, a yoga studio, an entertaining space and a common outdoor space. The apartments begin on the sixth floor.","Richard Rogers, an architect for Paris's Centre Pompidou, designs his first apartment building in the U.S. on a kite-shaped piece of land downtown.",e73e894e-23cc-59fb-859b-b80d8876f37d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/13/realestate/13beekman1/13beekman1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=2ea63f91d9ad47d8164412b8413289d8b5173f59994f3d0d05873eb706e8a278&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A rendering of One Beekman, which is being built on a site that used to be part of J&amp;R Music and Computer World.",e73e894e-23cc-59fb-859b-b80d8876f37d,N24News/imgs/e73e894e-23cc-59fb-859b-b80d8876f37d.jpg,7

They suggest that urban decay itself -- the way the city acquires and sheds layers, and has its past always peering out from underneath the present -- is, in essence, graffiti.

Graffiti is a career now, as well. The exhibition's second half , especially, acknowledges the way graffiti has become consonant with marketing, which is why the renegade gestures in those sections speak loudest: Craig Costello's drip art mailboxes, or the smiley faces painted by spray-can-wielding drones by KATSU, though those are less thrilling than his invasions of public space documented in the show's impressive catalog.

Once rebuffed almost everywhere, graffiti is now welcome almost anywhere: other art practices, other media, other philosophical zones. Look at the career of Futura 2000, represented in this show by one of his ""Pointman"" sculptures and some paintings, but who also has recently collaborated with the Mets, and also with Virgil Abloh (who is himself something of a graffitist). But maybe that's not so different than the early-to-mid 1980s photos displayed here of storefront gates turned into exuberant murals -- graffiti as intrusion, but also embrace.",An epically scaled exhibition flaunts the art form's pioneers as well as its provocateurs.,4c2acbb3-f875-557d-a652-aa64b94001ad,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/23/arts/22beyondstreets1/22beyondstreets1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=f076e6b89c9230c8dc3e65d074f011737aa09eac0468cebfe68e9aabe525ca98&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Paintings and sculptures by Futura 2000 at &ldquo;Beyond the Streets,&rdquo; a graffiti and street art exhibition in Brooklyn.",4c2acbb3-f875-557d-a652-aa64b94001ad,N24News/imgs/4c2acbb3-f875-557d-a652-aa64b94001ad.jpg,14
Dance,Troy Schumacher's BalletCollective Comes to N.Y.U.,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/arts/dance/troy-schumachers-balletcollective-comes-to-nyu.html,"New York City Ballet's fall season just ended, but the corps de ballet dancer Troy Schumacher isn't taking any breaks. Mr. Schumacher has been directing his own, much smaller company, BalletCollective, since 2010, and this spirited troupe returns to New York University's Skirball Center for the Performing Arts on Thursday, Oct. 27, and Friday with two new works.

Mr. Schumacher, always interested in cross-genre collaboration, is teaming with two architects, James Ramsey (the designer of the Lowline, an underground park set to open on the Lower East Side in 2020) and Carlos Arnaiz. One premiere takes inspiration from Mr. Ramsey's sketches, while the other deconstructs, through Mr. Arnaiz's architectural lens, a shot by the former N.B.A. star Allen Iverson. The program also features last year's ""Invisible Divide,"" to music by Ellis Ludwig-Leone, and a cast of Mr. Schumacher's City Ballet colleagues, including the principal dancers Lauren Lovette and Anthony Huxley.

But this year, the Richard Tucker Music Foundation is honoring a bass-baritone, Christian Van Horn. He is just the third bass-baritone to be awarded in the prize's 40-year history. The award comes with a cash prize of $50,000 and a celebratory performance at Carnegie Hall on Oct. 21.

At 39, Mr. Van Horn is significantly older than past winners. Ms. Sierra, who won last year, is currently 29. But there's a good reason for this discrepancy: ""It takes a long time for a low voice like his to mature, and it's been a privilege to watch and hear him grow,"" Barry Tucker, the president of the foundation (and the son of the award's namesake), said in a statement.

Style,Is Kratom Nature's Answer to Opioids?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/style/kratom-what-is-it.html,"The hype: Kratom, an ancient medicinal leaf from Southeast Asia, is the most recent cure-all to rise from the wellness fringes, particularly among those who frequent head shops for the latest medical breakthroughs. It's kind of like herbal Valium. Or maybe herbal Tylenol.

Elevator pitch: Kratom leaf, which is related to the coffee family, is touted as a plant-based alternative to Big Pharma. Popped in capsule form or prepared as tea, kratom can produce a mild psychotropic effect, though it's more of a gentle sense of well-being than a so-called trip.

Some use kratom as a mood booster, while others say it alleviates chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression. It has also been used to treat opioid addiction, though some government authorities say that kratom can be as dangerous as the opioids themselves.

Adopters: Despite its smoke-shop association, kratom is not limited to denizens of the Burning Man playa. As the recent Netflix documentary ""A Leaf of Faith"" makes clear, kratom has struck a chord with many, including war veterans, pain-addled athletes and professional wrestlers, as an alternative to opioid painkillers.","A leaf from Southeast Asia is touted as a painkiller, and creeps from smoke shops to health stores.",26b0d38f-536f-5439-844c-783f718ee984,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/10/style/10KRATOM1/10KRATOM1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=d183ebfae295d563c8e9e8ef0cb63dfdc6698e7b150414826a13b8bad266e7f1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The kratom leaf is creeping its way from Burning Man to the wellness mainstream.,26b0d38f-536f-5439-844c-783f718ee984,N24News/imgs/26b0d38f-536f-5439-844c-783f718ee984.jpg,15
Opinion,The Rich Love India's Lockdown. For the Poor It's Another Story.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/30/opinion/sunday/india-coronavirus-lockdown-inequality.html,"Credit...Adnan Abidi/Reuters



I landed in Delhi on a work trip in mid-March and just over a week later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced what was soon recognized as the world's strictest lockdown. He warned Indians to imagine ""a sacrosanct line"" around their homes, not to be breached for work or travel of any kind, not even a walk outdoors. Evoking the 18-day war described in the Mahabharata, an ancient Indian epic, Mr. Modi said it would take 21 days to win the war on the coronavirus. Two months later, I am still cooped up in my house off Delhi's Ring Road, by far the longest stretch I have spent in India since I first left for work in New York nearly two decades ago. My immediate concern was that in its usual way, India was copying measures that rich countries take to protect public safety and welfare but that low-income countries cannot afford. I was in touch with officials in other major emerging countries and none advocated total lockdowns because without the resources to support new armies of the unemployed, closing the economy would only lead to more hunger and death.

Within days, millions of displaced migrant workers were coursing out of major Indian cities -- thousands trudging right past my front door. Most were young men, released from construction jobs and evicted by nervous landlords. They planned to live on the kindness of strangers, which is not necessarily a losing bet in India, and to keep walking home to villages hundreds of miles away. I had to question how many would make it, walking side by side, at unsafe social distances. ""It doesn't matter,"" one young man told me. ""The government says that this is a serious disease, so what else can we do but go home?""

Delhi's liberal elite has long criticized Mr. Modi for his autocratic style and Hindu-centric agenda, but they rallied behind his lockdown immediately. Though India had seen relatively few deaths from the virus, the media had broadcast many images of people dying alone in Italy, Spain and the United States, and fear was spreading faster than the virus. Early on, the Modi administration made beds available for Covid-19 patients only in government hospitals -- infamous hellholes the privileged avoid at all cost. A friend was only half joking when he told me, ""Even if the virus isn't going to kill you, getting sent to a government hospital will."" After three weeks the government began replacing lockdown 1.0 with slightly looser versions, but instead of relaxing, many upper-class Indians were still confining themselves more strictly than the rules require -- and learning to love it. They posted odes to recipe sharing, Netflix, Zoom cocktail parties, the clear view of the sky and moon as the smog lifted over an idle nation. They gasped over images of leopards venturing into shuttered cities like Chandigarh, 150 miles from Delhi. Ah, nature! When I look out my living room window, I see dorms for the community staff and wonder how sublime this life can be for them. Does social distancing have any meaning for laborers packed six to a 200-square-foot room?

This crisis has been liberating for Indian bureaucrats and the police, self-important in normal times, ""essential"" now. WhatsApp is full of videos of the police beating people caught on the streets without a satisfactory excuse or forcing them to perform squats while holding their ears -- a punishment common in government schools. The commentary on these clips is often more humorous than horrified, including one mash-up that went viral with cricket-style commentary. By mid-April, many rich countries had started to debate reopening their economies, and protests were breaking out against lockdowns in several major U.S. states. In India, there was little public debate, much less protest. The hardest hit, the poor and unemployed, seem to accept their misery as fate, no doubt unaware of evidence showing that the more stringent the lockdown, the more severe the economic damage. Some estimates suggest that India's economy could contract by nearly 6 percent this year, making this the worst downturn in the country's post-independence history. All this and the Covid-19 death toll in India is around 4,700, fewer than the number who die, mostly in rural areas, each week from tuberculosis or diarrhea. Still, the urban elite has all the political influence, and most have remained steadfast supporters of the tough lockdown. ""If the government lifts restrictions, millions of illiterate Indians will pour into the streets and superspread the disease,"" a friend said.

But what of estimates showing that each week the lockdown is pushing tens of millions of Indians below the poverty line? The standard answer is: ""The government should take care of them. Just look how much the United States is spending on displaced workers."" Never mind that India has about one-twentieth the average income of the United States and, with its dysfunctional bureaucracy, is particularly ill equipped to manage the sudden displacement of so many workers. Constrained by high public debt and a large deficit, India's government has increased spending by less than 2 percent of gross domestic product since the lockdowns began -- compared with about 12 percent in the United States.

This lack of resources greatly complicates the challenge of helping the jobless in India, a far-flung group that is so hard to track that the government doesn't regularly report the unemployment rate. But a credible Mumbai think tank estimates that it has tripled under the lockdown to 24 percent -- well above the U.S. rate. And the United States has no group as large or underserved as the Indian migrant workers, who number around 140 million and for the most part do not qualify for India's limited unemployment benefits. For a while, the Indian media had stopped covering the flight of the itinerant laborers, sticking instead to positively patriotic takes on the war effort. But then 16 sleeping migrants were run over by a train on tracks they assumed, fatally, would be empty until the pandemic ends. Now they are back in the news. Many of those laborers are testing positive when they get home, driving up India's case count even as lockdown fatigue forces the authorities to ease up. It is past midnight on Ring Road as I sit down to write. Outside, angry shouting erupts. I go out. It is the migrants, moving in small groups, one fending off an attack by thieves from the nearby slums. They had set out on rumors about an imminent lockdown 4.0, assuming the worst. I hope they make it home safe. But learning to love life under lockdown? That kind of love is too expensive for them.

Food,What to Cook Right Now,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/17/dining/what-to-cook-right-now.html,"Good morning. My buddy Derr was smoking ribs and chicken out in his yard, and I was making freestyle red beans to accompany the meat. I made a sofrito of diced Portuguese chourico sausage, diced onions and red bell pepper, with lots of ground cumin, minced garlic and a zing of orange-mango juice. Then I stirred a few cans of beans into the mix and let all the flavors commingle for a while. Added a few tablespoons of Scotch bonnet hot sauce to bring the whole thing together, and a squeeze of lime. This took maybe 30 minutes and served a huge number of people. I might make a smaller version tonight, with white rice and a pile of buttered toast. Because that's a good dinner.

But you came here for actual recipes! I've got a few. You could make chicken salad tonight. You could make bulgogi. You could -- if only you'd planned to do so a few days ago and started the dough - make pan pizza. (Here's a quick dough that'll put you in pizza in about a half-hour, if you want to make a plain pie, which is what people in other places call a cheese pizza. Which do you say?)

I'd like to make these roasted carrots with parsley and thyme, eat them with some white, flaky fish cooked crisp on one side. Or cut out a little early so I have time to put together these Vietnamese summer rolls instead, eat them one by one as I page through an old Dan Simmons novel and think about vacation.

Best bet, though? Make Gabrielle Hamilton's recipe for chowder-soaked toast (above), reveling in its elegance and deliciousness. Do that, and you'll find yourself amazed at how little effort it takes, really, to deliver terrific food to those around you, on a weeknight at that, at the top of the week, when everything's generally frazzled and tight. Slurp at your chowder, bite at the softness of the toast, enjoy the clams and give thanks to GH and to yourself for heeding her call.","Big flavors and summery fare: Make chicken salad, saag tofu and Vietnamese summer rolls.",fd168252-34da-5b4a-8d7c-6f71b1d6baee,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/21/magazine/21eat1/21eat1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=b78414c8cc2ff6a31e55841acd1181ef86db374629e70330965ceb9167bc203b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Hot and milky: chowder-soaked toast.,fd168252-34da-5b4a-8d7c-6f71b1d6baee,N24News/imgs/fd168252-34da-5b4a-8d7c-6f71b1d6baee.jpg,17
Music,"Andy Gill, Radical Guitarist With Gang of Four, Dies at 64",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/arts/music/andy-gill-dead.html,"Andy Gill, whose slashing, dissonant guitar playing in Gang of Four inspired waves of post-punk to come, died on Saturday in London. He was 64.

The band announced his death on its website. A band spokesman said the cause was pneumonia.

Gang of Four's music was stark and bristling, yet danceable. Reimagining punk, funk and reggae with analytical rigor, the band set telegraphic lyrics and shards of guitar noise against austerely propulsive beats and syncopated silences. Its brusque, angular style would directly or indirectly influence post-punk and indie-rock bands like Red Hot Chili Peppers (who chose Mr. Gill to produce their debut album), the Jesus Lizard, Nirvana, Rage Against the Machine, Franz Ferdinand and Protomartyr. Michael Hutchence of INXS once said that Gang of Four's music ""took no prisoners,"" adding, ""It was art meets the devil via James Brown.""

Andrew James Dalrymple Gill was born on Jan. 1, 1956, in Manchester, England. He was an art student at Leeds University when he started Gang of Four with the lead singer and main lyricist Jon King, the bassist Dave Allen and the drummer Hugo Burnham. (It was named, mockingly, after the Communist Party leaders who ruled China during its Cultural Revolution years.) He and Mr. King, friends from high school, had used travel grants to visit New York City's burgeoning punk scene in 1976.

From the beginning, Gang of Four was determined to avoid all cliches, musical and verbal. ""You could tell by listening to Gang of Four music that punk had happened. But it definitely wasn't punk music,"" Mr. Gill told the online music magazine Perfect Sound Forever in a 2000 interview.","""You could tell by listening to Gang of Four music that punk had happened,"" he once said.

Media,The Mystery of Teen Vogue's Disappearing Facebook Article,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/business/media/teen-vogue-facebook.html,"On Wednesday, Teen Vogue published an article on Facebook's efforts to safeguard political speech. It had no byline and a glowing tone. Not long after it was posted, a line appeared, in italics, at the top of the story to signal that it was a paid advertisement: ""Editor's note: This is sponsored editorial content."" Soon after, the ""sponsored editorial content"" label disappeared. And then, the article itself vanished. Under the headline ""How Facebook Is Helping Ensure the Integrity of the 2020 Election,"" the lengthy Teen Vogue post included question-and-answer-style interviews with five female Facebook managers who said the platform was taking steps to avoid spreading misinformation and propaganda as another presidential election drew near. The article also included a portrait of the women.

""We're a different company than we were in 2016,"" Katie Harbath, Facebook's director of global elections, was quoted as saying. ""Including when it comes to elections."" Conde Nast, the owner of Teen Vogue, said in a statement, ""We made a series of errors labeling this piece, and we apologize for any confusion this may have caused. We don't take our audience's trust for granted, and ultimately decided that the piece should be taken down entirely to avoid further confusion."" A Conde Nast employee with knowledge of the arrangement, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said the article had indeed been commissioned as sponsored content, meaning it was an ad. Facebook pitched the idea for the article last year, when the social media network and the online magazine were in talks about the Teen Vogue Summit, a three-day event that took place in Los Angeles in November, with speakers including the YouTube star Liza Koshy and the film director Greta Gerwig. Facebook was a sponsor of the gathering. ""We had a paid partnership with Teen Vogue related to their women's summit, which included sponsored content,"" Facebook said in a statement. ""Our team understood this story was purely editorial, but there was a misunderstanding.""

Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, and other executives at the company shared the Teen Vogue story Wednesday morning, before it went into the digital ether.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""Great Teen Vogue piece about five incredible women protecting elections on Facebook,"" Ms. Sandberg wrote on her Facebook page. The post went on to plug the company's attempts to ""stop the spread of misinformation"" and ""fight foreign interference and voter suppression."" Phillip Picardi, Teen Vogue's former chief content officer, was one of the article's critics. ""I am so sorry to the @TeenVogue team for whatever irresponsible sales or marketing staff pushed this article into their feed, therefore discrediting all the GOOD work they've been doing to educate their audience about the REAL threats posed by @Facebook in our election,"" he wrote on Twitter. As the debate about the article made Teen Vogue a trending topic on Twitter, another online critic linked to the article and posed the question, ""What is this Teen Vogue?"" To that, the verified Teen Vogue account replied in a tweet that was later deleted: ""literally idk."" Facebook has struggled to shore up its reputation after a three-year string of debacles related to its handling of election interference and data privacy. Lawmakers and civil rights groups have warned that the company seems unprepared to counter the disinformation campaigns that clogged social media during the last presidential campaign. This week, a 2,500-word internal post by a Facebook executive, Andrew Bosworth, set off discord at the company. In his post, which was obtained by The New York Times, he warned against the temptation to skew the platform against President Trump's 2020 re-election campaign and stood by the company's stance on not censoring politicians' posts. Teen Vogue started in 2003 as a pet project of Anna Wintour, the longtime editor in chief of Vogue and Conde Nast's artistic director. In 2017, as the magazine gained attention for adding articles on politics and social issues to its mix, Conde Nast shut down the print edition.",The online magazine deleted a glowing story about Facebook after questions were raised about whether it was an ad.,425e8ae7-3eba-5cec-8c01-c7c89d82a51f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/08/business/08TEENVOGUEFACEBOOK/08TEENVOGUEFACEBOOK-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=8a0e986ddc80743f0d5851de2a2c6cac3f610ec54be9ad59240dfba17798c143&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A screenshot of the beginning of the article published on TeenVogue.com and later deleted.,425e8ae7-3eba-5cec-8c01-c7c89d82a51f,N24News/imgs/425e8ae7-3eba-5cec-8c01-c7c89d82a51f.jpg,16
Automobiles,Miracle Baby's Burden: New Family to Support,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/automobiles/autoreviews/12saab-9-5.html,"THE familiar two-digit name of the 9-5 gives no clue to the car's troubled birth  or to the near-miraculous survival of Saab. This all-new sedan needs a more evocative name. The Saab Lazarus, perhaps, or the Kummback. With Pontiac and other brands already felled by the bad economy, it is only natural to hope that the Swedish automaker can stick around. Yet as the revived company's first would-be savior  with the 9-4X crossover and a new smaller 9-3 sedan to follow  the 9-5 reveals a handsome face but feet of clay. Saab had been one of the brand castaways of the recession, cut loose by General Motors with few white knights in sight. But just when Saab seemed to be sunk, the owner of a speck-sized Dutch maker of exotic cars  Victor Muller of Spyker  stepped in to acquire the Swedish automaker for $400 million, including $74 million in cash. Now comes the hard part: reviving a proud company whose sales have plummeted  so sharply that some consumers assume Saab is dead and buried. Both the new management and some journalists place all of the blame on G.M. and its distracted stewardship.

These critics seem to have forgotten where Saab was headed before G.M. threw it a lifeline. Even before 2000, when G.M. fully absorbed the brand, the Swedes were getting their herring creamed by hungrier, nimbler luxury brands. Despite game-changing threats from Lexus and other fast movers, Saab clung to an obsolete strategy, offering scant model choices with limited appeal beyond a core group of fans. These few models were updated roughly every dozen years as rivals revamped their entire lineups in half that time, leaving Saab behind the competitive curve. The complacency continued under G.M. The last-generation 9-5 was a tired soldier after 13 years. And G.M. failed to give Saab the luxury crossovers that the company desperately needed. Ultimately, even loyal Saabistas got tired of being taken for granted. Mr. Muller's mission, as he sees it, is to win back owners who've fled from Saab  to Audi far more than to any other brand, he said in a recent interview  by recapturing the Scandinavian character that had leaked away during the G.M. years. Yet even as G.M. and Saab have divorced and squabbled, they still have to get along for the sake of the children: The new 9-5 is handsomely, unmistakably a Saab, yet under the skin the car remains a G.M. creation to its core. It shares its front- or all-wheel-drive platform with the solid Buick LaCrosse. Its engines and other components can be found in several G.M. models. That's not a major issue in itself. But a car born in such corporate turmoil bears the scars of separation. While G.M. was fighting for its life  and trying to unload its foster child  it abandoned development work on future Saabs, said G.M. executives and engineers deeply involved in its projects. In Detroit, the 9-5 sat untouched and unfinished for well over a year.

Unfortunately, the 9-5 leaves just that impression, of a car whose finishing touches were hastily applied or even overlooked. It's a car you want to love, with a swept-back elegance that makes a refreshing contrast to trendy or generic Asian luxury cars, and to the ubiquitous Germans that dominate the midrange luxury market. The 9-5 also feels especially roomy, front or back. But a key missing ingredient is chassis refinement, that alchemist's blend of a smooth ride and taut control that characterizes the 9-5's main rivals, including the Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, Cadillac CTS and Infiniti M37. There's much to admire in the 9-5, beginning with its graceful lines. Huge front air inlets and a wrapround cockpit nod to Saab's aircraft roots. The roofline falls sweetly, buttressed by strong, sweeping rear pillars. And where so many rivals conform to a wheels-at-the-corners approach, the Saab strikes a more classic profile with a long tail that extends far beyond the rear axle. The 9-5 looks modern yet stately. Like the best Saabs of the past, it's an individualist's car, with a timeless character that should look as good a decade from now as it does today.

This Saab is also huge, roughly seven inches longer and three inches wider than the previous 9-5. At 197 inches, the Saab stretches past any car in its class, with a spacious back seat that puts a 5 Series or CTS to shame. The cabin shows more good design. It is so attractive and comfortable that you nearly overlook the mediocre materials or the many bits obviously borrowed from the G.M. parts bin. Saab's offbeat Nordic charm shows in driver's gauges with green needles that glow as threateningly as Darth Vader's light saber; matrix-style air vents and a ""night panel"" button that blacks out most of the instrument panel. A keyless pushbutton replaces the key switch at the traditional location on the console  no more fishing for dropped keys between the seats. The seats are handsome and supportive. The controls, which initially seem haphazard, are smoothly functional. The car's Detroit-derived hardware is a mixed bag. The intuitive G.M.-based touch-screen navigation system is one of the most appealing interior features. Some switches, however, would look at home in a Chevy. And while the metal-ribbed shifter for the 6-speed automatic transmission looks good, it clomps noisily through its gate like a Clydesdale on a hardwood floor. I drove an Infiniti M37 back-to-back with the 9-5, and the contrast of the cabins was unavoidable. The encompassing richness of the Infiniti, to name just one competitor, makes a luxury statement that leaves the Saab wanting.

Again, it's the underripe nature of the car that draws criticism. I drove the 9-5 Aero, with its solid Haldex all-wheel-drive system, that starts at a heady $48,390. With options including the navigation system and 19-inch wheels, the price reached $52,360. On the plus side, the 9-5 delivers respectable fuel economy for its size: 16 miles per gallon in town and 27 on the highway. Saab offers a far more affordable Turbo4 model, starting at $39,350 with front drive and a turbocharged Ecotec 4-cylinder. Options on that version include a 6-speed manual transmission and all-wheel drive. But on paper, the Turbo4's numbers raise concern: how smartly can a 220-horsepower G.M. engine lug around a two-ton luxury sedan? For now, the 300-horsepower 9-5 Aero is powered by G.M.'s turbocharged 2.8-liter V-6, an engine that's competent but no prize winner. As mentioned, the Saab shares its platform with the LaCrosse, whose critical praise is well-earned  in part because the Buick costs barely $30,000, not $50,000. To its credit, the 9-5 smooths out the turbo's uneven power delivery. The 9-5 gathers power in a linear, pleasantly silent rush. There's just enough grunt to make the Saab feel not-so-slow; Car and Driver magazine recorded 0-to-60 acceleration at 6.3 seconds. But many competitors are downright fast. Weight is one issue: at 4,365 pounds the 9-5 Aero is the class heavyweight. The Saab's transmission can be slow and stubborn, even when you're changing gears with the the paddles on the steering wheel. There's plenty of tire grip, but so little steering feel that the 9-5 doesn't transmit much confidence or pleasure at high speeds. The Saab's boomy ride is its weakest point. A selectable system dials up three modes  Comfort, Intelligent and Sport  to adjust parameters including the suspension, throttle, transmission and stability control system.","The new 9-5 is handsomely, unmistakably a Saab, but a car born in corporate turmoil is likely to bear the scars of separation.",ad5e2526-47f0-52f1-a0d4-f5214532220d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/12/12/automobiles/WHEE-2/WHEE-2-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=268&w=600&s=3379cb8d2308ecd68afbfb73e5a827f5ccbc8c9061ee93804fdd81180e3cf3fa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"ADOPTED Saab's new owner revived development of the 9-5, which G.M. had put in limbo during its financial crisis.",ad5e2526-47f0-52f1-a0d4-f5214532220d,N24News/imgs/ad5e2526-47f0-52f1-a0d4-f5214532220d.jpg,23
Economy,"Behind Drop in Oil Prices, Washington's Hand",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/business/economy/washingtons-role-in-oil-prices-recent-fall.html,"The plummeting price of oil since Saudi Arabia decided last fall not to cut production to counter rising supply elsewhere has fueled intense speculation about a downfall of the infamous cartel, once feared for its power to bend oil prices to its will. Was OPEC's biggest oil producer unwilling or just unable to stop an emerging glut? Does this mean oil will never again reach $100 a barrel -- where the spendthrift governments of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries need it to be? What's missing from the discussion is an understanding of how the oil market got to this juncture and, notably, who brought it here. The answer is surprising. It was the United States, mostly. Last year, the United States produced more oil than it had in 25 years, surpassing Saudi Arabia as the world's largest producer.

Perhaps the most intriguing part of this story is that one of the main participants in this revolution is the American government. Facing fears of a broad energy shortage, in the shadow of an embargo by Arab oil producers, the Nixon administration and Congress laid the foundation of an industrial policy that over the span of four decades developed the technologies needed to unleash American shale oil and natural gas onto world markets. Environmentalists against any government involvement in the fossil fuels business will hate this, of course. But the collaboration between government and business in pursuit of energy independence offers a valuable lesson for policy makers forging a strategy to fit the current energy imperative: reducing carbon emissions to combat climate change.

By contrast, little has been said about the role the United States government played in developing new energy technologies. And yet for all the criticism aimed at the Obama administration's efforts to address long-term energy challenges -- and the derision over its failed investments in companies like Solyndra -- the government's most useful role might indeed be to support research and ventures that could deliver a low-carbon future. ""If there is one key lesson from the shale revolution, it is that public investments in technology innovation can bring a huge benefit for both the economy and the environment,"" said Michael Shellenberger, the president of the Breakthrough Institute, an advocacy group for sustainable development, in Oakland, Calif. The Breakthrough Institute has done the most thorough investigation I've seen of how three decades of government subsidies for research, demonstration and production helped bring about the revolution. Interest in shale deposits was driven by a search for gas, not oil. But the oil embargo gave them a big boost. Congress passed the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, creating the Energy Research and Development Administration -- which would soon become the Department of Energy. This kick-started a period of heavy government investment in research and development to recover gas from shale. The agency provided funds for ""directionally deviated"" drilling, a precursor to the horizontal drilling used today. It subsidized the development of polycrystalline diamond compact bits to cut through the shale. It performed the first big hydraulic fracturing. Energy Department labs created a multi-well fracking test site.
* What happened on Day 2 of Elizabeth Holmes's testimony.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations. Research at the Sandia National Laboratories into underground imaging -- based on microseismic monitoring once used to detect coal mine collapses -- was critical to map fractures and position wells.

The government did not always get it right. In fact, research into fracking initially took a back seat to efforts to produce ""synthetic fuels"" from things like ""oil shales"" -- which to date have delivered little in terms of cost-effective energy. The government could also stand in the way. Price regulation was a significant barrier to investment into ""unconventional"" gas deposits until it was freed during the Reagan administration. Of course, the government assistance would have come to nothing without private entrepreneurs who took risks and followed market signals. Fracking was mostly reserved for gas until gas prices started falling a few years ago, shifting producers' efforts to oil, which could be exploited using similar technologies. Yet Washington played a critical part in the story that led to oil's recent fall. According to Jim Hamilton, an energy economist at the University of California, San Diego, the world's real income increased by nearly 28 percent from 2005 to 2013. To keep oil prices stable, supply would have had to increase by over 19 percent. But field production of crude increased by only 3.1 percent. Supply was kept in check, in part, by unforeseen events: wars across the Middle East, attacks on oil infrastructure in Nigeria, sanctions on Iran. But OPEC's big producers, like Saudi Arabia, did not increase production, either. Excepting the momentary swoon after the financial crisis of 2008, flat output from the cartel kept prices on the rise for more than a decade. What brought the arrangement crashing down was American shale oil. By 2013, the United States was already producing 3.5 million barrels of shale oil. Given the new American supply, high prices could simply not hold. ""It was not feasible for the Saudis to defend $100 a barrel,"" Professor Hamilton said. ""It was a losing strategy. Fracking would have taken more of the market.""

A price of $45 a barrel does not portend a great future for American shale oil, which is comparatively expensive to produce. As investment in new shale production dwindles, oil prices are likely to recover. But even if a bunch of shale producers are driven out of business, the industry -- which can add or cut production more quickly in response to price signals -- might still change oil markets for good, putting a ceiling on oil prices closer to $50 a barrel than to OPEC's preferred $100. ""We probably won't see $100 a barrel for a while,"" said Jeff Colgan, a political scientist at Brown University who has studied the evolution of global oil. ""Fracking does put a bit of a ceiling on the price."" An important question is what this will do to efforts to combat climate change. Just as the surge in natural gas from shale sharply reduced carbon emissions from the nation's power plants, the plunge in oil prices offers a sobering reminder of the power of markets over policy. Consider, for instance, that the White House's middle estimate of the social cost of carbon -- which measures the broad damage of putting it into the air, a starting point for debates over a carbon tax -- is only about $43.39 per ton of carbon dioxide. That comes to about $18.66 per barrel of crude oil, a trivial sum compared with the significant price drop in recent weeks. Oil's swoon could feed directly through to bigger sport utility vehicle sales and more driving. It could blunt the political impetus to tighten fuel emissions standards.

But oil's gyrations also offer an opportunity. ""Reducing our heavy dependence on oil will require us to pay forward the huge return on our 40-year shale investments through a similarly long-term effort to accelerate the transition to fuel cell, electric or some other vehicles,"" Mr. Shellenberger said. The falling price of oil offers an opportunity for the government to raise the cash to do so. Rock-bottom oil offers a great opportunity to increase the gasoline tax without damaging Americans' purchasing power. Many Republicans -- even those most dismissive of climate change -- realize that cheap oil creates an opportunity to raise gas taxes without angering voters. If enough such Republicans could be found (a risky bet), the swoon in oil prices could be leveraged into a boon in tax revenue that the government could use to pick some of the winners that will help solve the problem.",The Nixon administration laid the foundation of a policy that developed the technology to produce American shale oil.,9807608b-987d-571f-89d1-5c3085e63a24,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/21/business/21PORTER/21PORTER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=a336d55b09f27a6642eb4f50439d456512acbb1b549542f4b95785f39d8bd702&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An oil rig control room.

Health,Trump's F.D.A. Nominee Sidesteps Questions About Banning Flavored Vaping Products,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/health/vaping-trump-fda-hahn.html,"President Trump's nominee for Food and Drug Administration commissioner, Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, declined to answer questions from senators in both parties about whether he would push for a ban on flavored vaping products at a confirmation hearing Wednesday. The questions placed Dr. Hahn, a cancer executive without any Washington or governing experience, at the center of a political battle over the surge in teen vaping and the emergence of mysterious vaping-related illnesses that have killed at least 44 people and sickened more than 2,000. Most of the lung injuries reported in recent months have been attributed to THC-related products. The Trump administration has recently retreated from a promise in September that it would ban most flavored e-cigarette products, citing concerns about the effects on businesses and repercussions from voters.

Dr. Hahn, who is the chief medical executive of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, said he had not discussed the issue with Mr. Trump. He added that the decision on flavor restrictions would not come under his purview because it was already under final review by the White House. But he also noted his training as a lung cancer doctor, and said at the hearing, ""I think this is an important, urgent crisis in this country,"" adding that he did not want to see another generation of teenagers become addicted to tobacco and nicotine. ""I believe that we need to take aggressive action to stop that.""

Several states and municipalities have tried to outlaw flavored e-cigarettes and are now facing court challenges from the vaping industry. On Tuesday, the American Medical Association called for a far-reaching ban on all vaping products, as two more states sued Juul, the nation's largest seller of e-cigarettes, over its marketing practices. The questions about e-cigarettes, by members of the Senate's Committee on Health, Education Labor and Pensions, highlighted how carefully Dr. Hahn would need to navigate a range of sensitive issues if he were confirmed to lead the F. D.A., a sprawling agency with oversight of everything from tobacco and e-cigarettes to food safety and the approval of drugs and medical devices. At the hearing, Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, described the questions about e-cigarettes as a ""canary in the coal mine"" that would demonstrate how Dr. Hahn would respond to political pressure and corporate influence . ""How you will deal with this issue is a pretty good test case for how you will deal with these issues on an ongoing basis,"" he said. Dr. Hahn sought to portray himself as a committed cancer researcher and medical doctor who would bring the values of those professions to his tenure as F.D.A. commissioner. ""Patients need to come first, and the decisions that we make need to be guided by science and data, congruent with the law,"" he said.

If he is confirmed by the Senate, Dr. Hahn would fill the vacancy left by Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who stepped down as commissioner in April . On Tuesday, five former commissioners, including Dr. Gottlieb, endorsed Dr. Hahn. Dr. Hahn's views on how vaping products should be regulated would occur at a critical juncture, as e-cigarette companies begin submitting evidence ahead of a May deadline to show that their products do more good than harm. He will have to balance public outcry over teen vaping use with intense lobbying by e-cigarette manufacturers and vape shops that argue their products provide an alternative to traditional cigarettes and their users make up a potent voting bloc. The federal government has repeatedly weakened or delayed efforts to rein in vaping products over the past decade. In 2016, the Obama administration backtracked on a proposed ban on flavored e-cigarettes, and in 2017, Dr. Gottlieb extended a key deadline for vaping manufacturers to provide evidence about their products' effects on public health. If he is confirmed, Dr. Hahn has said he would divest his interests in dozens of companies that do business with the F.D.A., from Coca-Cola and Starbucks to technology companies, like Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which is developing health care products. He also said he would resign his positions at institutions like M.D. Anderson, the University of California San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center and the University of Pennsylvania. He said he also would recuse himself from discussions involving those institutions for a year after his resignations. The committee chairman, Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said a vote by the committee on Dr. Hahn's nomination is expected in early December.","The nominee, Dr. Stephen M.

Technology,A Private Equity Firm Is Blocked From Buying .Org,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/technology/dot-org-sale.html,"A private equity firm will not gain control of dot-org, the digital real estate that is home to millions of nonprofits, nongovernmental organizations and community groups. The board of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which oversees the internet naming system, decided on Thursday night to veto the sale of the rights to dot-org to Ethos Capital, which had offered more than $1 billion. Maarten Botterman, the chair of ICANN, wrote in a blog post that after all the considerations were weighed, rejecting Ethos's proposed bid was ""reasonable, and the right thing to do."" Ever since the planned sale was announced in November, the deal had stirred fierce opposition. Dot-org is best known as the cyber neighborhood to nonprofit organizations with civic missions like the Red Cross (redcross.org), Human Rights Watch (hrw.org) and NPR (npr.org).

To many, handing control of dot-org to a private equity firm seemed almost like heresy. The growing ranks of opponents eventually included internet pioneers, nonprofit leaders and the attorney general of California, Xavier Becerra. The opponents raised several concerns, including the risk of steep price increases, underinvestment and censorship. Ethos Capital tried to address those worries by pledging to set up a ""stewardship council"" of outside experts and making ""public interest commitments"" to restrain price increases and not censor web content. But critics remained unconvinced. They did not believe that a private-equity firm, driven by the need to deliver rich returns for investors, would act in the best interests of what they regard as the domain of online civic society. In an interview on Friday, Mr. Botterman said a ""convincing majority"" of the 15 voting members of the board opposed the Ethos Capital bid. The overarching concern, he said, was the apparent ""lack of guarantees that the spirit that was always intended for dot-org"" would be preserved if the private equity firm gained control. ICANN's ruling on Thursday and the current arrangements for managing dot-org are byproducts of the arcane governance and history of the internet naming system.

In 2002, ICANN granted the Public Interest Registry, another nonprofit, the right to run the dot-org domain. Part of the rationale was that the domain should not be managed on a purely commercial basis -- unlike dot-com and dot-net, for example. The Public Interest Registry, in turn, is controlled by the Internet Society, a nonprofit that helps develop internet standards, education programs and policy. The registry holds a contract to manage dot-org, which was renewed last year for 10 more years. But under the rules governing the registry, ICANN must approve major changes in its practices and ownership. The Internet Society saw the sale to Ethos Capital as a way to gain an endowment to fund its operations and get out of the business of operating dot-org, which it wanted to do for some time. In an interview this week, Andrew Sullivan, chief executive of the Internet Society, said the Ethos Capital bid was one of several proposals it had received -- and one that appeared to combine people who had internet experience with the financial resources to help dot-org grow and prosper. ""We viewed it as a good transaction and that would be good for everyone,"" Mr. Sullivan said. If ICANN rejected the Ethos Capital deal, the Internet Society had no immediate backup plan, Mr. Sullivan said, adding that dot-org would be run as before. ""We will not neglect dot-org,"" he said. The opposition to the Ethos Capital bid took a number of forms, including an alterative proposal made in January by a group of internet veterans and nonprofit leaders called the Cooperative Corporation of .ORG Registrants. Among the cooperative's initial seven directors are Esther Dyson, who was the first chair of ICANN, and Mike Roberts, ICANN's first president. The Internet Society, Mr. Sullivan said in the interview this week, has not yet had talks with the cooperative's founders.",The deal for the internet domain for nonprofit organizations had set off fierce opposition.,a9f33cf1-85bc-5f8e-86f7-74506bdfa798,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/02/business/30dotorg-print/30dotorg-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=9a3240a2b6440b3dab8de5b946422f6dae6dfbfcaa0824e052278c32402c5e7b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Protesters outside the Los Angeles headquarters of the regulatory body for domain names, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, in January.",a9f33cf1-85bc-5f8e-86f7-74506bdfa798,N24News/imgs/a9f33cf1-85bc-5f8e-86f7-74506bdfa798.jpg,20
Technology,Canada Tries to Turn Its A.I. Ideas Into Dollars,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/09/technology/canada-artificial-intelligence.html,"TORONTO -- Long before Google started working on cars that drive themselves and Amazon was creating home appliances that talk, a handful of researchers in Canada -- backed by the Canadian government and universities -- were laying the groundwork for today's boom in artificial intelligence. But the center of the commercial gold rush has been a long way away, in Silicon Valley. In recent years, many of Canada's young A.I. scientists, lured by lucrative paydays from Google, Facebook, Apple and other companies, have departed. Canada is producing a growing number of A.I start-ups, but they often head to California, where venture capital, business skills and optimism are abundant. ""Canada is not really reaping the benefits from this A.I. technical leadership and decades of investment by the Canadian government,"" said Tiff Macklem, former senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, who is dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto. Now bringing A.I. home is a priority for the Canadian government, companies, universities and technologists. The goal, they say, is to build a business environment around the country's expertise and to keep the experts its universities create in the country.

There are encouraging signs, including new government funding, big company investments, programs to nurture start-ups, and the changing habits of homegrown entrepreneurs and American venture capitalists. In its new budget, the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged $93 million ($125 million Canadian) to support A.I. research centers in Toronto, Montreal and Edmonton, which will be public-private collaborations. The Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Toronto, announced two weeks ago, will be one of them. The institute begins with commitments of $130 million, about half the money coming from the national and provincial governments and the other half from corporate sponsors like Google, Accenture and Nvidia, as well as big Canadian companies like the Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank and Air Canada.

Mr. Hinton, who was hired by Google in 2013 but remains a professor at the University of Toronto, will serve as its chief scientific adviser. The new institute will be in the Mars Discovery District, a cluster of buildings in downtown Toronto, run by a public-private partnership, that is home to many tech start-ups including A.I. companies.. Major technology companies, like Google, Microsoft and IBM, are adding to their A.I. research teams in Canada. So are companies in other industries.

Last year, General Motors said it was going to locate one of its research and engineering hubs for self-driving cars in the Toronto suburb of Markham. And Thomson Reuters announced it would open a center for ""cognitive computing"" in Toronto for research into new ways professionals will use information and technologies to assist decision making. Building businesses that use A.I. is an economic imperative for Canada. The Canadian tech industry has stalled in recent years. Nortel, Canada's big telecommunications equipment maker, declared bankruptcy in 2009, and was wound down over the next several years. And BlackBerry, once a leader, has faded in the smartphone market. The experience of two start-ups applying A.I. technology to drug discovery illustrate the challenges -- and the opportunities -- facing Canadian start-ups. Atomwise, a company that uses A.I. technology to predict what new molecules might combat specific diseases like multiple sclerosis, was founded in 2012. Its chief executive, Abraham Heifets, earned his Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Toronto.

Later, Mr. Heifets went to the Bay Area and met with Timothy Draper, founder of the venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Mr. Draper observed that he had invested in a couple of companies trying a similar approach 20 years ago. That didn't deter him from trying again. ""That's a cultural issue, a different appetite for risk and willingness to accept failure,"" Mr. Heifets said. Atomwise moved to San Francisco to be close to its investors and the region's enormous talent pool. By contrast, Deep Genomics, founded in 2014, has stayed in Canada, and its American-based venture backers encouraged it to remain in Toronto. Brendan Frey, the chief executive, studied under Mr. Hinton at the University of Toronto, and he has spent years on research that combines deep-learning A.I. and cell biology. When he hires software engineers, he asks them to make multiyear commitments.

Both Atomwise and Deep Genomics were participants in different years in a program called the Creative Destruction Lab. Founded in 2012 by Ajay Agrawal, a professor at the Rotman School, the lab was set up to help technology-intensive start-ups. They are typically founded by a Ph.D. scientist who has worked on an idea for five years, but has little or no business experience. In 2015, the program tilted toward A.I. start-ups, with 25 companies admitted. Last year, 50 A.I. start-ups were admitted, and this year will likely have 75, Mr. Agrawal said. The program lasts nine months, with fall and spring terms, much like a school year. The participants gather every eight weeks in Toronto for two days to make presentations, listen to advice and set goals for the next eight weeks. At every gathering, at least one and sometimes several companies are voted out. The voters are a growing group of tech entrepreneurs and investors whom Mr. Agrawal has recruited. One of the X factors in Canada's drive to develop an A.I. industry is the Trump administration. Canadian A.I. scientists say they have received a stream of inquiries from researchers in the United States, concerned about the new administration's stance on immigration and other policies. Should there be a northward migration it wouldn't the first time. Mr. Hinton settled in Canada in 1987 in part because of America's clandestine support for the Contra guerrillas who sought to overthrow the left-wing Sandinista government in Nicaragua.

Mr. Hinton, who is from Britain, was at Carnegie Mellon University at the time, and he realized that continuing his research in America would have meant accepting funding from the Reagan administration. ""I preferred Canada,"" Mr. Hinton recalled. Mr. Sutton left the United States to become a professor at the University of Alberta in 2003, after American troops landed in Baghdad. ""George Bush was invading Iraq,"" he said. ""It was a good time to leave.""",Today's striking advances in artificial intelligence owe a lot to research in Canada over the years. But the country has so far failed to cash in.,4dc897ca-998e-5a06-9683-949b73f59a77,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/08/business/10CANADAAI1/10CANADAAI1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=79c099cc29fe089cf6a65906778f59c8b653f355e0de5a2044ff2a2f8acb2ea1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Mars Discovery District in Toronto is one of the world's largest innovation hubs.

Theater,Kanye West Called Out (on Twitter) for Cellphone Use During 'The Cher Show',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/theater/kanye-west-cher-show-cellphone.html,"Kanye West Called Out (on Twitter) for Cellphone Use During 'The Cher Show'

It's a familiar story: Someone goes to a Broadway musical, ignores the audience rules of conduct and pulls out a phone. But on Monday night, that someone was Kanye West, the musical was ""The Cher Show,"" and it was the glittery and bespangled opening night. The performance had been underway for about an hour when the actor playing Sonny Bono, Jarrod Spector, took to Twitter to call out Mr. West's behavior.

On Tuesday, Mr. Spector declined a request for an interview. The producers of ""The Cher Show"" issued a seven-word statement: ""We are happy Kanye enjoyed the show."" The incident is the latest in a long line of cellphone distractions at Broadway shows, and reflects an increasing willingness by performers to call out what they see as misbehavior in the audience.

Just last week, at a preview of ""The Cher Show,"" Stephanie J. Block, one of three actresses playing the title character, asked a patron to stop video recording her performance while she was midsong (she turned off her microphone between lyrics so her request could not be widely heard).

And Mike Birbiglia, the comedian now performing a solo show on Broadway, has repeatedly been interrupting his show to engage with people whose phones ring or who appear to be texting or taping during his performance. Mr. West is not the first celebrity to run afoul of theater performers. In perhaps the most famous instance, Madonna was apparently using her phone during an Off Broadway performance of ""Hamilton,"" prompting the star, Lin-Manuel Miranda, to refuse to allow her backstage. (""#noselfieforyou,"" he said on Twitter, although he did not name the celebrity and later took down the tweet.)

Automobiles,Maserati Recalls Cars; Mercedes-Benz Investigation Is Upgraded,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/automobiles/maserati-recalls-cars-mercedes-benz-investigation-is-upgraded.html,"Maserati will recall 63 of its 2014 Quattroporte GTS V8 models because of a possible loss of electrical power and a potential fire risk, according to a report posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website.

Maserati said the wiring harness for the alternator-starter motor was defective. The problem could cause an electrical short, loss of power and possibly a fire in the engine compartment. Maserati said it learned of the problem from a consumer complaint overseas and had received no reports of problems in the United States.

In another action, N.H.T.S.A. upgraded its investigation into whether almost 253,000 Mercedes-Benz C-Class cars from the 2008-11 model years should be recalled because a wiring problem could cause taillight failure and, potentially, lead to trunk fires. In a new report posted on the safety agency's website, federal investigators said Mercedes told them that corrosion between two taillight connectors could cause ground wires to overheat.

The report says the agency is aware of 402 complaints about the failures, including claims of five fires and one injury. The severity of the injury was not noted. Accordingly, the agency is upgrading the investigation to a more serious engineering analysis. That is more likely - but not certain - to result in a recall.","Maserati will recall 63 vehicles for electrical problems, and an N.H.T.S.A. investigation of more than 250,000 Mercedes-Benz cars has been upgraded.",38982e90-893d-575b-95aa-17c1903964f7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/28/automobiles/28RECALL/28RECALL-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=305&w=600&s=c065d8397dd32ee543053527dfdb07e02c03b8383997116630806fec19b1724d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,The 2014 Maserati Quattroporte GTS.,38982e90-893d-575b-95aa-17c1903964f7,N24News/imgs/38982e90-893d-575b-95aa-17c1903964f7.jpg,23
Technology,When Start-Ups Go Into the Garage (or Sometimes the Living Room),https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/technology/tech-startups-garage.html,"When Start-Ups Go Into the Garage (or Sometimes the Living Room)

SAN FRANCISCO -- It is the folksiest of Silicon Valley origin stories: Tech start-up makes it big after a wide-eyed entrepreneur builds a prototype in his garage. But Colin Wessells could never have imagined that a pandemic would force him back into the garage just to keep his company going. Dr. Wessells, 34, is one of the founders and the chief executive of Natron Energy, a start-up building a new kind of battery. In March, when social distancing orders shuttered his company's offices in Santa Clara, Calif., he and his engineers could no longer use the lab where they tested the batteries. So he packed as much of the equipment as he could into a sport utility vehicle, drove it home and recreated part of the lab in his garage. ""It was only a fraction of the test equipment,"" Dr. Wessells said. ""But we could at least run some new experiments."" Designing and creating new technology -- never easy tasks -- have become far more difficult in the pandemic. This is particularly true for companies building batteries, computer chips, robots, self-driving cars and any other technology that involves more than software code. While many American workers can get by with a laptop and an internet connection, start-up engineers piecing together new kinds of hardware also need circuit boards, car parts, soldering irons, microscopes and, at the end of it all, an assembly line.

""We moved millions of dollars of equipment just so people could continue working,"" said Andrew Feldman, chief executive of Cerebras Systems, a start-up in Los Altos, Calif., that is building what may be the world's largest computer chip. ""It was the only way we could keep making these physical things."" To continue development of Cerebras's dinner-plate-size chip even when the office was closed, one of Mr. Feldman's engineers, Phil Hedges, turned his living room into a hardware lab. In mid-March, Mr. Hedges packed the 10-by-14-foot room with chips and circuit boards. There were also monitors, soldering irons, microscopes and oscilloscopes, which analyze the electrical signals that travel across the hardware. To accommodate the gear, Mr. Hedges set up three folding tables. He put half the equipment on the tabletops and half on the floor below. There was so much heat from the computer hardware running day and night that he also set up massive ""chillers"" to keep the makeshift lab from getting too hot.

Pumping a supercold liquid through plastic tubes that snake around the hardware -- ""it looks kind of like bright blue Gatorade,"" Mr. Hedges said -- the chillers did what they were supposed to do. But they required extra attention, especially since Mr. Hedges and his family had just bought a new dog, and the puppy enjoyed chewing on the tubes. ""If the dog had ever bitten through the tube, there would have been pumps shooting fluid everywhere,"" he said. For his wife, the bigger problem was the never-ending whir of the chiller pumps. ""That's what drove her over the edge,"" Mr. Hedges, 45, said. In July, he moved some of the gear back into the Cerebras offices, where he now works on occasion, largely alone. Only seven other people are allowed in the 35,000-square-foot office, with most others still at home with their own gear. The arrangement works well enough, Mr. Hedges said, though he does not always have the equipment he needs because it has been scattered across so many people's residences. Like Cerebras, other tech start-ups are finding that they need to move their makeshift labs from one place to another -- or have several jury-rigged labs going at the same time -- to keep development going. Voyage, a self-driving car start-up in Palo Alto, Calif., initially bought various self-driving car parts and shipped them to two engineers so they could work at home. The start-up sent them lidar sensors (the laser sensors that track everything around the car) and inertial measurement units (the devices that track the position and movement of the car itself) so they could keep testing changes to the car's software. But Voyage did not just rely on the at-home setups. In some cases, it arranged for engineers to log on to their home computers for remote access to a collection of car parts set up at the company's offices.

Called ""the HIL"" -- short for ""hardware in the loop"" -- this was basically a car without wheels, complete with steering rack and braking system. Rather than run tests on the contraption up close, engineers tapped into it over the internet and ran tests from afar. ""It helps make us more efficient,"" said Eric Gonzalez, one of Voyage's founders and a director of engineering. ""But we had to change our road map."" If all else failed, there was always the garage.

In Silicon Valley, the garage has long had a kind of mythical aura. In the 1990s, Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed Google in a garage. In the late 1930s, Bill Hewlett and David Packard created Hewlett-Packard in another. Today, the HP Garage, in Palo Alto, remains well preserved and is sometimes called the ""birthplace of Silicon Valley."" Now, in the pandemic, the Silicon Valley garage has become a metaphor for making use of whatever space is available to do what needs to be done, engineers said. Mr. Hedges, the Cerebras engineer, said he had moved equipment into the living room only because he did not have a garage. The Landscape of the Post-Pandemic Return to Office
* None
* Delta-variant delays. A wave of the contagious Delta variant is causing companies to reconsider when they will require employees to return, and what health requirements should be in place when they do.
* A generation gap. While workers of all ages have become accustomed to dialing in and skipping the wearying commute, younger ones have grown especially attached to the new way of doing business. This is causing some difficult conversations between managers and newer hires.
* How to keep offices safe. Handwashing is a simple way to reduce the spread of disease, but employers should be thinking about improved ventilation systems, creative scheduling and making sure their building is ready after months of low use.
* Return-to-work anxiety. Remote work brought many challenges, particularly for women of color. But going back will also mean a return to microaggressions, pressure to conform to white standards of professionalism, and high rates of stress and burnout. ""If we had a garage, my wife would have put me there -- with the chillers,"" he said. In the one-car garage of Dr. Wessells, the Natron chief executive, the recreation of the office lab allowed him to test batteries inside ""environmental chambers"" the size of mini-refrigerators that control temperature and humidity. He said he had taken over the workbench in the garage with all of the equipment. ""I was the only one in the company who could run new experiments,"" Dr. Wessells said. ""I just had to keep calling our scientists, asking how to hook everything up.""","Labs closed in the pandemic, but innovation doesn't stop.

Music,Review: The Wrenching 'Fire Shut Up in My Bones' Becomes an Opera,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/16/arts/music/fire-shut-up-in-my-bones-opera-review.html,"The bass-baritone Davone Tines stars in ""Fire Shut Up in My Bones,"" a new opera inspired by Charles Blow's memoir.





ST. LOUIS -- The composer Terence Blanchard and the librettist Kasi Lemmons, the creators of the new opera ""Fire Shut Up in My Bones,"" based on the 2014 memoir, were inspired by the book's wrenching tale of a black boy growing up, the youngest of five brothers, in a segregated rural Louisiana town. And, to their credit, they were not intimidated by it. The memoir -- by Charles Blow, an Opinion columnist for The New York Times -- tells of a childhood shaped by cycles of violence, a family life of tough love and chronic turbulence, and the lasting wounds of sexual molestation. Mr. Blow offers an adult's reflections in a book that often has the quality of a biblical jeremiad. Mr. Blanchard, an award-winning jazz trumpeter and film score composer, and Ms. Lemmons, a writer, actress and director, found inventive ways to tell Mr. Blow's story in the present, and on their own terms, something that came through at the premiere of their subtly powerful work by the Opera Theater of St. Louis on Saturday. (This is Mr. Blanchard's second commission from that company, following ""Champion,"" in 2013.) [How opera is grappling with race this summer.] One simple device was to present Charles as two characters: a young boy called Char'es-Baby (played with endearing awkwardness by Jeremy Denis, a treble) and the 20-year-old Charles, (the charismatic bass-baritone Davone Tines), who is attending a local college. The opera opens, like the memoir, with Charles in a rage, speeding down a country road at night with murder in mind.

His cousin, Chester, who molested the 7-year-old Charles one night while sharing a bed during a visit -- it's ""just a game,"" Chester (Markel Reed) said -- has reappeared. ""Someone must die,"" the older Charles sings, in a long, fervid monologue. ""And maybe the part of me I despise will die with you."" Mr. Tines is gripping, at once terrifyingly volatile and sadly vulnerable. This scene is effectively suggested in the director James Robinson's brilliantly simple, evocative production, which uses vivid video projections and movable set pieces that evoke a house's interiors.

Mr. Blanchard has said his score is not a jazz opera, but an opera in jazz. His music bears out this description, conducted here stylishly by William Long. Restless vocal lines shift from plaintive lyrical phrases, to sputtered outbursts, to a style that seems a jazz equivalent of Italianate arioso. Often, as characters sing, threads of darting melodic lines run through the orchestra embedded within dense, chromatic harmonies. (Howard Drossin is credited with additional orchestrations.) Mr. Blanchard has a penchant for having groups of instruments and blocks of chords support and double the vocal lines. But the music, which is full of surprise twists and phrases that often get cut off, never allows this mimicking to become a predictable tick. In the book, the troubled Charles is visited nightly by male apparitions. In the opera, these spirits coalesce into a twofold female character called Destiny and Loneliness, an idea that easily could have been cliched. But the soprano Julia Bullock, ravishing in the role, brings out every emotional nuance in the music. Her character can be like an alluring yet dangerous siren calling to Charles. ""So, you've come back, boy,"" she says in the opening scene; ""I knew you would."" But Destiny and Loneliness are figures Charles has created of necessity. And Destiny, as sung by Ms. Bullock, is also an empowering voice. During the fraught, boisterous family scenes, the adult Charles becomes like an older brother to his child counterpart; they often sing in duo. Billie, the hardscrabble mother (the feisty, rich-voiced soprano Karen Slack), works in a chicken factory to keep her family fed and as stable as possible. Her womanizing husband, Spinner (the bright-voiced tenor Chaz'men Williams-Ali), is a hopeless provider who tries to keep sweet-talking his way into Billie's good graces. She won't have it, and finally chases after him with a pistol she keeps handy.

Mr. Blanchard and Ms. Lemmons almost go too far in numerous soul-searching monologues that can skirt close to melodramatic excess. But Mr. Blanchard always rescues the moment by heeding the words and varying the music. Vocal lines flow from lyrical wistfulness to snappy declamations; dense big-band sonorities in the orchestra segue into lighter passages backed by a jazz rhythm section. And there are rousing evocations of gospel choruses at church, blues and, during a fraternity party, a rhythmic chorus of spoken words, finger snapping and dance steps. An aggressive edge in this dance music proves prophetic: Soon we see Charles enduring a brutal hazing.

The grim climax comes when Chester has his night with the young Charles. By not depicting what happens explicitly, the scene is all the more disturbing. We see the cousins quietly undressing for bed. Then they face the audience as Chester describes the ""game."" In the book, Mr. Blow relates agonized explorations of masculinity and sexual identity. That tangle of feelings is conveyed effectively in a dreamlike dance scene (Sean Curran is the choreographer), the opera's most mysterious episode. Over slinky strings and slowly heaving rhythms, Charles hungrily hugs and dances with both men and women. In an inspired touch, during the final act, Ms. Bullock takes on another role: Greta, a sweet college student whom Charles hopelessly falls for. Their rapturous love scene culminates in a night of blissful sex. Greta, seeming troubled, says they should trade secrets. Charles tells her about being molested, and Greta confesses that she is involved with another man. When she frantically rushes off, Charles frets that by opening up he has driven her away -- the opera's most poignantly revealing moment. Destiny returns to tell Charles there is no escape, that you must be what you must be. He calls Billie, his mother, who has always told him, wisely, that you can't keep carrying everything, that ""sometimes you gotta leave it in the road.""","This new work, with music by Terence Blanchard and a libretto by Kasi Lemmons, is a bold and affecting adaptation of Charles Blow's memoir.",2bfe94d9-8b20-525a-ab50-976c8527e9ac,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/16/arts/16fire-opera/16fire-opera-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=faeecc410e6b2f023132e845d041e24944106c2fa0afe6f6b620ca1120bda3de&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The bass-baritone Davóne Tines stars in ""Fire Shut Up in My Bones,"" a new opera inspired by Charles Blow's memoir.",2bfe94d9-8b20-525a-ab50-976c8527e9ac,N24News/imgs/2bfe94d9-8b20-525a-ab50-976c8527e9ac.jpg,12

Gymnastics Hires N.B.A. Executive as President,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/sports/usa-gymnastics-li-li-lueng.html,"Li Li Leung, a vice president of the N.B.A., was named president and chief executive of U.S.A. Gymnastics on Tuesday, taking the helm of a federation in chaos in the wake of a sexual-abuse scandal.

Leung, 45, has worked at the N.B.A. since 2015, and was most recently its vice president for global partnerships. She said she had actively sought the gymnastics position out of a ""personal calling,"" having participated in the sport from the age of 7 and having represented the United States at the Junior Pan-Am Games and the University of Michigan in the N.C.A.A.

""It breaks my heart to see the state that the sport is in today, and that is why I stepped forward,"" Leung said on a telephone conference call for which reporters were required to submit questions beforehand. ""I believe I can create positive change in the organization and the sport and give gymnasts what they do actually deserve.""

Leung said her priorities were for U.S.A. Gymnastics to reach a ""fair and equitable"" resolution of lawsuits filed by victims of sexual abuse committed by Lawrence G. Nassar, a former team doctor; embarking on a listening tour and speaking with victims face to face instead of through lawyers; and creating an athlete-driven federation ""where safety is central to everything we do.""",Li Li Leung will take over an organization still reeling from a sexual-abuse scandal.

Automobiles,"For Automakers, Fuel Economy Targets May Be Less of a Stretch",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/19/automobiles/wheels/for-automakers-a-coming-fuel-economy-mountain-has-become-a-molehill.html,"WHEN David Key drove his new mostly aluminum-body Ford F-150 pickup home this year, he knew he had made the right choice. Mr. Key, of Holly Springs, N.C., outside Raleigh, previously owned a 2007 version of the truck with a beast of an engine -- a 5.4-liter V8 -- that gave him all the power he craved. But the new F-150 featured a much smaller, 3.5-liter V6, as well as a body made largely from aluminum instead of steel. He was intrigued, but a little nervous. Could the new truck measure up? ""It's been fantastic,"" he said. ""I can't even believe it's got a V6 in there because it gets more power"" than the older truck. ""And the gas mileage is incredible."" Mr. Key, 47, said his new truck got more than 23 miles per gallon on a recent family vacation to Florida, a substantial improvement over the 18 m.p.g. he used to get.

When Ford first put a 6-cylinder turbo in the most popular vehicle in America several years ago, critics questioned whether consumers would accept the change. They did. When the company decided to then shed hundreds of pounds of weight by using aluminum, questions again were raised. Although sales have lagged the pickup market this year, Ford has blamed supply issues and not demand. Such innovations in engine technology and lighter, yet stronger materials are likely to power the entire auto industry as it strives to meet the looming 2025 fuel economy standards, a sweeping new report commissioned by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has found. In fact, the 600-page report, released Thursday, found that hitting those fuel targets of a corporate average of 54.5 miles per gallon could most likely be done without as much difficulty as the industry had feared. For years, the industry has warned that the goals will be all but impossible to meet without widespread adoption of zero-emission technologies like electric cars. While the study focused primarily on midsize vehicles, it concluded that existing technology like 8-speed transmissions, advanced turbochargers and lighter materials were most likely enough, on their own, to allow automakers to meet the 2025 standards. Electric or fuel-cell vehicles might still be bonuses for automakers, but they were unlikely to be necessary to reach the goal. The study was conducted by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, which brought together experts from the auto industry, academia and environmental groups. It evaluated more than 100 combinations of fuel-saving technologies to measure both fuel savings and economic cost.

The cost of carrying out the new rules, the study found, would be significantly less than expected -- roughly half of what a previous 2011 report by the same group had estimated. ""This is a good early indication that things are on track to meet the fuel efficiency goals on time and at a reasonable cost,"" said Roland Hwang, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's energy and transportation program. ""There were lots of claims flying back and forth early on about how much this would cost, and now we know it's going to be very affordable by comparison."" In calculating the cost to automakers of getting a typical midsize car to meet the 2025 target, the study offered two estimates: $1,200 or $1,700, depending on certain assumptions. By comparison, the 2011 study had estimated those costs could be higher than $3,000. ""This is great news,"" said Dan Becker, a director at the Center for Auto Safety, an advocacy group. ""It shows that you can achieve these fuel economy targets with a conventional vehicle, using normal engines, and to do so cost effectively."" Mitch Bainwol, chief executive of the Auto Alliance, a trade group representing several automakers, said that car manufacturers would review the report's findings to ""see how they square with the real-world challenges faced by engineers in our testing labs."" ""Today, automakers are using every technology available that can improve mileage and still keep vehicles affordable for Americans,"" Mr. Bainwol said in a statement. ""Looking ahead, we will need to see much greater sales of our most energy-efficient vehicles, including electric vehicles, to meet the steep fuel economy standards."" Julia Rege, director of environment and energy affairs at Global Automakers, another industry trade group, said that ""significant challenges remain"" for manufacturers to reach the 54.5 miles per gallon fleet average by 2025. The current average is 31.5, according to an estimate by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute.

""Greater flexibilities will be necessary for the industry to meet the future standards,"" Ms. Rege said in a statement, adding that automakers ""look forward to continuing our work with the regulatory agencies."" In 2011, when the Obama administration announced its plan to nearly double American automobiles' corporate average fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon, the industry resistance behind the scenes was significant. As part of negotiations, the administration agreed to what was called a ""midterm review"" of the regulations in 2017 -- a chance for automakers to take stock of where they are six years later and argue for possible weakening of the rules. With regulators expected to complete that review by November 2017, the jockeying has already begun, and the safety agency commissioned the new report to act as a vital resource to guide its decision. ""The industry keeps saying we need to change the rules at the midterm review because no one wants to buy an electric car,"" said Mr. Becker of the Center for Auto Safety. ""But the rules don't require selling electric cars, and this report shows you really don't need them to get there."" Automakers disagree and point out that the study focused largely on midsize vehicles, while manufacturers' larger offerings like trucks and S.U.V.s could need no-emissions electric vehicles to balance them out. John O'Dell, senior editor at Edmunds.com, said that while automakers might have a point that more alternative fuel vehicles could be needed, the adoption of relatively simple, available technology like stop-start (which turns the engine off when a car stops) could make the difference. Gasoline and diesel engines are becoming so good at squeezing every drop from a gallon of fuel that the cars of 2025 are likely to seem quite familiar, he said.",A federal report found that hitting the corporate average of 54.5 miles per gallon might not be as difficult as the industry had feared.,70e45f40-8c95-535d-b39b-2d10416c92cd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/19/business/19WHEELS/19WHEELS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=61169286554df8f5235fb8233387464e18b4bba2ab86554fcea5a69a1d47a285&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"David Key's new Ford F-150 pickup, with a V6 engine and aluminum body, has better mileage and more power than his old F-150.",70e45f40-8c95-535d-b39b-2d10416c92cd,N24News/imgs/70e45f40-8c95-535d-b39b-2d10416c92cd.jpg,23
Technology,Facebook Tightens Rules on Verifying Political Advertisers,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/technology/facebook-election-advertising-disinformation.html,"Facebook said its advertisers must submit the additional documentation by mid-October or it would pause noncompliant ad campaigns.

""We truly understand the importance of protecting elections and have been working for quite some time to bring greater transparency and authenticity to ads about social issues, elections or politics,"" said Katie Harbath, Facebook's public policy director for global elections.

Over the past few years, Facebook has struggled with questions about election interference and disinformation on its platform. The social network has worked to secure its site during elections, setting up so-called war rooms to handle false content and bad ads during the 2018 midterm elections in the United States, as well as the national election in India this year and the European Union's parliamentary elections. It also rolled out the transparency policy on political advertising.

Yet Facebook has applied its political advertising policy inconsistently. NBC News recently found that one political advertiser had sidestepped Facebook's rules and was running ads under decoy company names. Last month, academics also called the social network's ad archive -- a tool Facebook introduced in late 2018 to allow the public to analyze political ads and ferret out disinformation campaigns -- ""broken,"" describing it as riddled with bugs and technical issues.

Ms. Harbath said that Facebook's tools were not perfect and that it would ""continue to learn from elections in the U.S. and around the world."" Facebook alone cannot tackle political disinformation in ads, she said, adding that advertisers, governments, regulators, journalists and researchers will need to participate in addressing the global disinformation problem.","Bracing for the 2020 U.S. presidential election, the company adds more steps for buyers of political ads.

The Romans have been using it since the days of Julius Caesar, but not to get high. Both Washington and Jefferson grew it. Now that several states have legalized the use of marijuana for some recreational and medical purposes, one of the biggest untapped markets for the cannabis plant itself -- at least one variety -- could be as a building tool. The most sustainable building material isn't concrete or steel -- it's fast-growing hemp. Hemp structures date to Roman times. A hemp mortar bridge was constructed back in the 6th century, when France was still Gaul. Now a wave of builders and botanists are working to renew this market. Mixing hemp's woody fibers with lime produces a natural, light concrete that retains thermal mass and is highly insulating. No pests, no mold, good acoustics, low humidity, no pesticide. It grows from seed to harvest in about four months.

A strain of the ubiquitous Cannabis sativa, the slender hemp plant is truly weedlike in its ability to flourish in a wide variety of climates, growing as high as 15 feet and nearly an inch in diameter. The plant's inner layer, the pith, is surrounded by a woody core called the hurd. This is the source of the tough fiber, which can be used for rope, sails and paper. Hemp is typically planted in March and May in northern climes, or between September and November below the Equator. Once cut, usually by hand, plants are left to dry for a few days before they're bundled and dumped into vats of water, which swells the stalks. Those dried fibers are then blended for a variety of uses, such as adding lime. This creates block-like bricks known as hempcrete. Industrial hemp contains a mere 0.3 percent of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the substance responsible for the buzz when smoking weed. The cannabis present at a reggae fest, for instance, contains as much as 20 percent. The two strains look different, too. Hemp's sativa is taller; the shorter indica has resiny trichomes accounting for its psychoactive power. The rule goes: the better the budding flower, the poorer the hemp.

Getting a mature plant in just a few months -- with less fertilizer than needed for industrial crops like corn, and without chemical fertilizers or bug sprays -- makes the potential for profit huge. As hemp taps water underground, its long roots circulate air, which improves soil quality -- another boon for farmers looking to rotate crops. Battling the plant's powerful drug connotation might be the toughest hurdle for farmers and builders, and is possibly a more formidable obstacle during the Trump administration. The plant is still highly regulated. This January, though, California legalized use of the plant in full. And the federal farm legislation of 2014 legalized hemp's cultivation for research purposes in universities in states where it's been approved by law. New York now funds a research initiative for as much as $10 million in grants toward hemp businesses, with participation in the pilot program from institutions that include Cornell University. Still, in the United States special permits are needed to build with hemp, and the requirements can vary by county and state. The first modern hemp house was constructed in 2010, in North Carolina. There are now about 50 such homes in the country. But not much hemp is grown here; a little less than 10,000 acres so far, enough for about 5,000 single-family homes. Cultivated acreage in Canada is double that, and in China's Yunnan province, 10,000 farmers grow it. Roughly 30 nations now produce hemp, including Spain, Austria, Russia and Australia. Hemp was rediscovered in the 1980s across Europe, where cultivation is legal, and France has became the European Union's largest hemp producer. Hundreds of buildings across the continent use the substance as insulation to fill walls and roofs, and under floors in wood-framed buildings.

Hemp shouldn't be used at ground level, or it loses its resistance to mold and rot. Lime plaster coatings or magnesium oxide boards have to be applied to anything touching hempcrete, or the lime will calcify it and lose its ability to absorb and release water. While that sounds like a lot of work, Ms. Beckerman pointed to the long-term payoff. ""In many climates, a 12-foot hempcrete wall will facilitate approximately 60-degrees indoor temperatures year-around without heating or cooling systems,"" she said. ""The overall environmental footprint is dramatically lower than traditional construction."" There still aren't international standards for building with hemp, or codes regulating how it should be used structurally or safely. ASTM International, a technical standards organization, formed a committee to address this in 2017. Nonetheless, the use of hempcrete is spreading. A Washington State company is retrofitting homes with it. Left Hand Hemp in Denver completed the first permitted structure in Colorado last year. There's Hempire in Ukraine, Inno-Ventures in Nepal. Israel's first hemp house was constructed in March on the slopes of Mount Carmel.

Down south, New Zealanders turned 500 bales of Dutch hemp into a property that fetched around $650,000. In Britain, HAB Housing built five homes with hempcrete last year. Canada's JustBioFiber recently completed a house on Vancouver Island with an interlocking internal framed hemp-block inspired by Legos. It's a niche but growing sector of the cannabis market. In 2015, the Hemp Industries Association estimated the retail market at $573 million in the United States. ""When I started Hempitecture in 2013 and presented the concept, venture capitalists laughed at the idea,"" said Matthew Mead, the founder of Hempitecture, a construction firm in Washington. ""Now there are over 25 states with pro-hemp amendments and legislation, and the federal farm bill has its own provision supporting the development of research toward industrial hemp."" One major issue is cultivation. Although it has been legal to grow hemp in Canada since 1998, farmers need to apply for licenses. In Australia, industrial hemp agriculture has been legal for over 20 years. In the United States, a provision in the farm bill removed hemp grown for ""research purposes"" from the Controlled Substances Act. Farmers and researchers in more than a dozen states can now import hemp seeds. The Industrial Hemp Farming Act, pending in the House for the seventh time, would exempt hemp plants in toto from the controlled substance designation, an Olympic leap toward a burgeoning agro-business.

Sergiy Kovalenkov, 33, a Ukrainian civil engineer who spent the last three years building hemp structures and consulting on projects in Ukraine, France, Sweden and Jamaica, is beginning a project in California. The hardest steps, Mr. Kovalenkov said, are paperwork, permits and seeds. ""Building codes vary from state to state, with regulations in terms of fire and seismic activities,"" he said. ""If we're talking sustainable product, seeds cannot come from Poland or France. It has to come from California."" Only one facility in the United States processes hemp stalks, in North Carolina. Mr. Kovalenkov's firm, Hempire USA, has also devised its own fiber separation system. ""The demand is going to be quite big in the next three to five years,"" Mr. Kovalenkov said. But what does a hemp house smell like? ""It smells like comfort,"" Mr. Kovalenkov said, laughing. ""It smells a little like lime. We're using the stalk. You cannot smell cannabis -- it has nothing to do with smoking weed or cannabis plants. It's an industrial agriculture crop."" In October, representatives from 14 countries attended the seventh annual Hemp Building Symposium at the International Hemp Building Association in Quebec. Terry Radford, the president of JustBioFiber Structural Solutions, an I.T.-pro-turned-tinkerer, unveiled a prefab hemp composite that could be more attractive to city planners and government building code officials. ""The problem with hempcrete right now,"" he said, ""is each one has to be inspected and have an exemption from the building code. It's difficult for builders to get approved. If you're trying to get a mortgage on your house, it's pretty restrictive. That's our biggest challenge."" ""Our idea is to get the material certified by building coders, rather than have each one approved,"" he added. ""The difference between hempcrete and my block product is that we're a structural product. Hempcrete by itself is just an insulation."" The start-up is preparing to produce a 112,000-square-foot facility in British Columbia. Mr. Mead, the head of Hempitecture, echoes the concerns of others. For farmers to expand, he said, the infrastructure has to be there. Without a network to process materials, ""it will be difficult for farmers to know if they can grow this crop and turn a profit.""","Widely used in other countries, a variety of the cannabis plant is providing contractors with more efficient construction materials for houses and other structures.",5389ead3-cb92-5da0-83c8-8a1ab5f1584b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/30/science/30SCI-HEMPCRETE/30SCI-HEMPCRETE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=b7035f83aecbb5eccf8795e3231dac20351209dca8434f8478dabd84ab8dd3cf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Russians sorting raw hemp fibers in the Kursk region in the 1960s.

Television,"Rewatching 'Game of Thrones,' Season 5: Light a Candle",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/arts/television/game-of-thrones-season-5.html,"The final season of ""Game of Thrones"" arrives April 14. Before then, we're getting prepared by rewatching the first seven seasons. Sign up to get these straight to your inbox. Do you doubt me? Still? After all that you have seen? There is only one way. You must binge before the Long Night begins.

 Welcome back to our guide through an epic ""Game of Thrones"" rewatch. If you've just joined us, you can catch up with recaps of past seasons with our ultimate watching guide, which also includes suggested episodes to rewatch in later seasons. Or you can give us a taste of your blood for a vision of Season 5. Novices beware: This article is dark and full of spoilers. And now our watch continues. How Should I Rewatch 'Game of Thrones'? Concentrate on the installments that are central to the famously complicated plot and provide all the feels. Here are four must-watch episodes.

Episode 1, ""The Wars to Come"" -- To savor the show's first flashback, revealing that there was a time when Cersei actually had friends! To untangle the clues regarding King Robert's death. To cuddle with the Unsullied. To unpack Tyrion's crate and Varys's plan, and to drink to the future of Westeros. (Recap.) Episode 4, ""Sons of the Harpy"" -- Delves into the rise of radical movements in both King's Landing and Meereen, provoked in both places by the actions (or inactions) of their respective queens. Bonus: Lots of Rhaegar and Lyanna tidbits. (Recap.) Episode 9, ""The Dance of Dragons"" -- An episode thick with emotion, from the intimations of doom surrounding Shireen's BBQ to the sheer exhilaration of Dany's takeoff from the fighting pit. (Recap.) Episode 10, ""Mother's Mercy"" -- This one is jam-packed. Sansa escapes. Arya kills. Cersei walks. And -- oh no! -- Jon dies. (For now.) (Recap.)

In the chaos following Tywin Lannister's death, many characters attempt to take control, often in the face of intransigent foes -- religious fanatics, political insurgents, armies of the dead. Trying to pick apart the intricate plot? Thinking along these themes and settings might help. Two knights set off to rescue a princess in Dorne. Never mind that she's feisty and in love and doesn't want to go home. (She should, though -- her life is in danger in ways she doesn't understand.) A would-be knight and squire set off to rescue a princess in the North; she refuses their aid as well. Both of these rescue attempts fail at first, but later sort of succeed -- when it's too late, unfortunately. (Myrcella gets poisoned; Sansa gets raped.) These things happen all the time in Westeros (and Essos), where the characters are determined to save not just other people but whole classes of people, even countries. ""Westeros needs to be saved from itself,"" Varys says. Jon Snow, an action hero if ever there were one, wants to save the wildlings to prevent them from becoming soldiers in the Night King's army. But the Free Folk waste valuable time arguing about this, and then the Night King and his minions roll up. Thousands of people die (thus qualifying to join the army of the dead). The dragonglass is lost. The Night's Watch -- not thrilled that Jon's bringing the surviving wildlings through the Wall -- decides to kill him. Rescue attempts will not succeed simply because the rescuer has honorable intentions. After Dany takes off on her first flight on Drogon, her people decide that she needs a rescue from her rescue. Why does it occur to no one in this world that maybe she doesn't -- that maybe she will be the one to save them? What do you do when you need some dirty deed done that you can't do yourself? In Westeros and Essos, it's simple: Use a proxy! Hire a Faceless Man to assassinate anyone you like and make it look like an accident. Deploy the Sons of the Harpy to mount violent protests against abolition (not a popular idea among former slave masters). Or empower the Sparrows (now the Faith Militant) to simply arrest your enemies. Using a proxy has the added advantage of affording some degree of anonymity -- something most of these shadowy organizations also prize. The Sons of the Harpy go masked on their terrorist excursions. The Faceless Men require acolytes give up their belongings and their names. And the Sparrows must surrender their worldly possessions as well, even their shoes. The High Sparrow maintains a prudent distance from the violence done in his name, allowing him to put on a kindly and avuncular mask of his own. Of course, the Night King is the ultimate master of proxies -- he's able to compel masses of the dead to do his bidding. He doesn't even have to ask (or pay) them. Sex is a big deal on this show because it's a form of power. That's why Margaery crows about consummating her marriage with the king -- the sex is what makes her queen. Sex outside of marriage is an even bigger deal this season, as brothels become a key part of the political landscape. Littlefinger's brothel, managed by the male prostitute Olyvar, is raided by the Sparrows not once, but twice. The first time because the High Septon enjoys its services, the second just to shut the place down and make a statement about who's in charge of King's Landing now. And let's not forget that Olyvar's relationship with Loras Tyrell was only a means of spying on him for Littlefinger and Cersei. Even though Littlefinger also facilitates highborn marriage arrangements, don't forget that he is actually a pimp. (Or a flesh-peddler, as Lancel calls him. Whichever you prefer.)

There are more brothels across the Narrow Sea, and naturally we visit them, too. There's the one in Braavos, where Meryn Trant seeks underage girls to abuse; the one in Meereen, where a sex worker lures cuddle-hungry Unsullied to be ambushed by the Sons of the Harpy; and the pleasure house in Volantis, where a slave cosplays as Daenerys, Mother of Dragons. Is this some kind of political statement? Not far from there, slaves gather to hear a former sex slave-turned red priestess preach the gospel of the Lord of Light and herald the Red Temple's endorsement of Dany as the Savior. ""Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously,"" Varys observes. Dany, as we know, is trying to end human trafficking in Slaver's Bay; Yunkai's primary export is ""bedslaves."" The Wise Masters of Yunkai are merely Littlefinger writ large. Dany isn't fighting a war only against common slavery, she's fighting a war against sex trafficking, and against a patriarchy that provides few options for slave-born, lowborn or otherwise vulnerable women and men. ""The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros,"" Roose Bolton tells Petyr Baelish. ""Yet here you are in the North undermining them. Why gamble with your position?"" Because, says Littlefinger, ""Every ambitious move is a gamble."" There is a lot of gambling this season, not all of it paying off. The Iron Bank calls in one-tenth of the crown's debt at a time when the Bank is backing both Tommen's and Stannis's competing claims for the throne. ""We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank,"" Tycho Nestoris insists. Mace Tyrell counters: ""You are the world's best gamblers."" After all, like Littlefinger, the Iron Bank is hedging its bets by playing both sides. In Littlefinger's case, he's trying to keep the Eyrie in his pocket (via his influence over Robin Arryn); win the North (priming Sansa, brokering the marriage alliance with the Boltons); and retain favor with Cersei (telling her about the marriage, giving her Olyvar as a witness against Loras); and undermine the Lannisters (giving Lancel to the Tyrells). Whoever comes out on top in the North or at court, he should be able to claim the victor as an ally -- or so he hopes. At least Littlefinger is thinking several moves ahead, something Cersei and several others should be doing. Arya gambles with her position as a Faceless Man acolyte by ignoring her assignment: to kill one of the biggest gamblers in Braavos, the insurance man who agrees to pay the families of the ship captains and owners should they die at sea. This is a man who is gambling with the lives of other people -- apparently something even the god of death cannot abide. As despicable as some of the High Sparrow's methods are, he actually has a point -- the common people have been much neglected in the games that the high lords play.

The crowds make their feelings known to Dany in Meereen -- when they hiss at an execution, when they cheer the contests at the fighting pits -- but Cersei has spent the bulk of her time in King's Landing avoiding the riffraff. (Part of her fight with Margaery stems from the fact that Margaery became a beloved figure of the people.) Varys dreams of a land ""where the powerful do not prey on the powerless,"" where the ruler could ""intimidate the high lords and inspire the people."" Dany struggles all season with just that, especially when it comes to the high lords. She debates what she should do with the great families and former slave masters of Meereen. Intimidate them, as she attempts by burning one alive? Kill them all, as Daario suggests? Or marry one, to build an alliance? She knows she has to do something, and she's going to have to have a better strategy should she ever hope to rule Westeros. ""Here in Slaver's Bay, you had the support of the common people and only the common people,"" Tyrion points out to her. ""What was that like? Ruling without the rich?"" Her response is that she's going to ""break the wheel"" -- stop the endless jockeying for position among the noble families that crushes the people underneath. But how? How Should Your Sweet Summer Child Watch 'Game of Thrones'?

Watching with younger viewers? You might want to just skip this entire violent season. But here are the most egregious scenes: The Sons of the Harpy attack. An Unsullied soldier goes to a brothel and gets his throat slashed. (About 18 minutes into Episode 1, lasts one minute.) More Unsullied soldiers get attacked, and Ser Barristan Selmy joins the fight. (About 46 minutes into Episode 4, lasts about four minutes.) During a fighting pit sequence, the Sons of the Harpy start their massacre at about 46 minutes into Episode 9. (Drogon comes to the rescue four minutes later.) Melisandre burns Mance at the stake. (About 52 minutes into Episode 1.) Shireen Baratheon gets her turn in Episode 9 -- her pleading, screaming and crying might be harder to take than anything visual. (The scene starts around 33 minutes in and is over about four minutes later.) Jon Snow beheads Janos Slynt for disobeying an order. (About 43 minutes into Episode 3.) Jon's own men later kill him during a mutiny led by Alliser Thorne. The stabbing starts a little over 58 minutes into Episode 10.

The Faith Militant march the naked High Septon through town. (About 44 minutes into Episode 3.) In Episode 4, they go on another rampage at Littlefinger's brothel, interspersed with a rather disturbing scene of Lancel getting his forehead carved with a seven-pointed star. (Starts about 11 minutes in.) Ramsay has sex with Myranda before his marriage to Sansa (about 22 minutes into Episode 5); consummates his marriage with Sansa in a disturbing, off-camera rape (about 52 minutes into Episode 6); and displays a woman he's flayed (about 16 minutes into Episode 7). The people in Slaver's Bay might like to watch slaves -- sorry, freed men -- fight to the death for entertainment's sake, but your kids don't have to. The first fighting pit excursion is in Episode 7, about 48 minutes in, and lasts three minutes. The second is in Episode 9, and the first contest starts at about 38 minutes in, but it doesn't get lethal until two minutes later. Jorah enters the fray at 42 minutes in, and that might be harder to take. At 46 minutes in, it morphs into the Sons of the Harpy attack. For the most skittish, you might want to skip the entirety of the Hardhome sequence once the dogs start barking about 44 minutes in. The panic intensifies at 47 minutes in, when the wights start to break through the gate, and by 50 minutes in, it turns into a horror show. This is one of the most brutal deaths on the show, and it's preceded by a sequence of Trant beating up some underage girls who shouldn't be at the brothel in the first place. The beatings start at about 22 minutes in, and Arya takes off her face and becomes a little killing machine about a minute-and-half later, gouging out his eyes, stabbing him and slitting his throat. She's done within a minute-and-half after that. Cersei is forced to walk naked from the Sept of Baelor to the Red Keep. Her walk of atonement starts at about 50 minutes in and includes much verbal abuse as well as men and women exposing themselves to her, throwing things at her, spitting on her and more. The ordeal lasts five minutes.","We've reached the fifth season in our grand ""Thrones"" rewatch, and the show's most debated death.",35787043-689d-551a-bbda-a5b89a36c177,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/25/arts/25THRONES-NL-1/25THRONES-NL-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=d9dbcec01eac640c5760b8587e9082a9d84d46697c1b93f02b9c374f6f1d04c3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) in ""Game of Thrones.""",35787043-689d-551a-bbda-a5b89a36c177,N24News/imgs/35787043-689d-551a-bbda-a5b89a36c177.jpg,3
Real Estate,Living Small Is the Best Revenge,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/realestate/living-small-is-the-best-revenge.html,"Despite less-than-rhapsodic memories of miniaturized apartment living, the married architects Mimi Hoang and Eric Bunge designed the winner of the adAPT micro-unit competition sponsored by the New York City Housing and Preservation Department and endorsed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. Their entry, ""My Micro NY,"" features 55 prefabricated apartments, of 360 square feet or less, stacked in a 10-story building on East 27th Street in Kips Bay. The building does not stint on amenities, providing a common terrace, a laundry room and a bike room. The couple's firm, nArchitects, is based in a Dumbo loft, and they live in a Carroll Gardens town house, but for the competition they drew on their cohabitation in a tenement in Lower Manhattan. The mission was to seize an opportunity to render a tight space habitable and, if possible, aesthetically pleasing.

""At first blush we weren't so sure about entering,"" Mr. Bunge said, ""because we felt people should have more space than this. But that was before we understood that the alternatives out there are far worse. There are people living together in substandard apartments all over the city who would prefer to live alone but can't afford to. So we said, 'Wait a minute, let's make a humane small space where people would want to live.' "" The architects say the design is flexible and transferable to virtually any neighborhood or borough. ""This is a pilot program, and it doesn't mean micro-units are going to be sprouting everywhere,"" Ms. Hoang said. ""But it's incredibly exciting to be part of a progressive new residential prototype for New York that has social implications and is intended to help solve a social problem. ""This is not a return to tenement or S.R.O.-style living,"" she added. ""There are amenities and a very social dimension to the design."" The target tenants are singles, who constitute nearly a third of the city's households, and couples with a limited income. Forty percent of the units are designated as affordable housing, with rents that start at $914 a month and top out at $1,873.

And no, combination units are not on the horizon: ""One of our friends, an artist, told us he wanted to buy three of the units and combine them,"" Mr. Bunge said, ""and after we got done laughing, we told him first of all, these are rentals, and second, combining them would totally defeat the entire purpose."" The objective of the contest, undertaken by 33 design teams (nArchitects partnered with Monadnock Development and the Actors Fund Housing Development Corporation), was to design affordable, appealing apartments in the 250- to 350- square-foot range. Construction on the $15 million building, envisioned by the architects in four shades of gray brick, will start by the end of the year. The units the couple designed for ""My Micro NY"" are being built at a factory in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The layouts vary (though the kitchens and baths are identical), but all offer several surprising features: a nine-foot-high sliding glass door that opens onto a Juliet balcony, ceilings nearly 10 feet in height, a full closet and 16 linear feet of built-in overhead storage. ""They're going to be miles better than the apartment we used to live in,"" Mr. Bunge said. Nick Lembo, the president of Monadnock, recruited nArchitects for the competition. ""Some architects shy away from modular construction, and some are intimidated by micro-units,"" he said. ""But Mimi and Eric were excited by the creative challenges. They created an incredibly space-efficient unit with an open design that will make it feel larger than its square footage.""

As Ms. Hoang put it: ""We imagined a building that could become a New York housing model -- make a big impact with small rooms. The repercussions on the housing market could be broad, and that's thrilling for us. Not lucrative, but thrilling."" Ms. Hoang, 41, and Mr. Bunge, 45, are thin people, of average height and not overly fond of furniture -- they are capable, in other words, of functioning in a relatively small residential footprint -- but they recall their five years in a 350-square-foot hovel in the East Village with minimal nostalgia.

It was the sort of place, Mr. Bunge said, where you morphed your body into a pretzel to negotiate the splinter of space separating the bathroom sink from the toilet and the door. A dungeonlike ambience closed in like an unwanted embrace the moment one entered the building, and it failed to improve inside the three remarkably paltry rooms, which cost them $1,200 a month. ""It had absolutely no amenities,"" Ms. Hoang recalled, ""except for the neighborhood and the fact that it was rent-controlled."" But they were recent newlyweds (married in 1998), and they made a mutual decision to leave their 1,400-square-foot rental loft in Boston. Both had received master's degrees in architecture from Harvard, and their goal was to get jobs, save money and establish their own firm. So the price was right, even if the tenement was a downer. With no room for their books, they stashed them in a rented storage unit in Brooklyn. By 1999 they had started nArchitects, which today employs 11 people. In 2004 they won the Museum of Modern Art's Young Architects Program with ""Canopy,"" a felicitous and sinuous outdoor installation of green bamboo on MoMA's P.S. 1 campus in Long Island City. They landed their first residential project, the seven-story Switch Building at 109 Norfolk Street, in late 2004 and completed it in 2007. Here, they designed four 1,400-square-foot floor-through apartments, a 2,000-square-foot penthouse, and a ground-floor art gallery. Barry Bergdoll, the chief curator of architecture and design at MoMA, was on a committee that reviewed the entries for the adAPT competition, which were submitted without names attached. The winner was announced in late January. ""Theirs was by far my favorite,"" he said, ""so it was a pleasant surprise when I found the winning entry was Mimi and Eric's, because we've been watching their progress ever since 2004. It is so astutely and sensitively thought out, with a maximization of storage potential in a minimal space; it really looks like how a person might actually live.""",The architects Mimi Hoang and Eric Bunge won a design contest for micro apartments.,c16ce336-ee02-5990-b5b5-01e06ca5bdcf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/03/03/realestate/03DEBRIEF1_SPAN/03DEBRIEF1_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2013&h=338&w=600&s=a7947b30ec4bf17b899ad5692c44c68a257fdb6082c76a08d3bc12474cf3439e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Mimi Hoang and Eric Bunge of nArchitects won a city competition for the design of a micro-unit apartment house.,c16ce336-ee02-5990-b5b5-01e06ca5bdcf,N24News/imgs/c16ce336-ee02-5990-b5b5-01e06ca5bdcf.jpg,7
Health,F.D.A. Moves to Restrict Flavored E-Cigarette Sales to Teenagers,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/health/e-cigarettes-teenage-vaping.html,"The new restrictions do not apply to menthol, mint or tobacco flavors, which the F.D.A. wants to keep available for adults who are using e-cigarettes to quit smoking combustible cigarettes.

The F.D.A. will also track youth use of menthol and mint e-cigarettes, Dr. Gottlieb said. If they become too popular, he added, the F.D.A. will reconsider the exemption. Such a move would be especially harmful to Juul Labs. The vaping giant, under F.D.A. pressure, has already moved sales of its flavored e-cigarettes online, except for menthol, mint and tobacco, which it sells in stores.

But some public health advocates say the moves are too late.

""While this announcement sounds big and bold, it isn't really,"" said Micah Berman, an associate professor at The Ohio State University College of Public Health and Moritz College of Law. ""The F.D.A.'s announcement exempts mint/menthol, which is the most popular flavor with kids and one that makes it easier to initiate use. And in any event, most kids are getting these products online or through older friends, not buying them in convenience stores.""

The proposal also calls for banning the sale of many flavored cigars.

""The data also indicate that eliminating flavors from cigars would likely help prevent cigar initiation by young people,"" Dr. Gottlieb said. Under the new plan, cigar companies would have 30 days to remove the products from the market, and would have to apply for F.D.A. approval to go back on the shelves.

In addition, all e-cigarettes, cigars and related products not on the market by Feb. 15, 2007, must seek F.D.A. approval to sell them by August 2021. As part of their application, manufacturers must prove that their products are beneficial to public health. The agency's original deadline for these products to comply with new, tougher regulations was extended by Dr. Gottlieb from August 2018 to 2022. Wednesday's action chops one year off that extension.

The plan issued on Wednesday is still a draft, and must undergo a 30-day comment period before it can be finalized. It's an unusual regulatory approach, neither a new rule, nor a voluntary guideline. Instead, the F.D.A. is telling e-cigarette makers that if their products are sold in violation of this request, they can be taken off the market, and forced to apply for agency approval.

Theater,Review: 'Mean Girls' Sets the Perils of Being Popular to Song,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/theater/mean-girls-review-broadway-musical.html,"Erika Henningsen as Cady Heron in the musical ""Mean Girls,"" adapted by Tina Fey from her screenplay for the cult-favorite 2004 film.

Let me say up front that if I were asked to choose among the healthy lineup of girl-power musicals now exercising their lungs on Broadway, you would have to count me on Team Regina. That's a reference to the alpha leader of the nasty title characters of ""Mean Girls,"" the likable but seriously over-padded new show that opened at the August Wilson Theater on Sunday night. I hasten to add that I am in no way endorsing the crushing elitist behavior of Regina George, a teen clique queen embodied here with red- (or rather pink-) hot coolness by Taylor Louderman. I was once a public high school student myself, and writhed painfully beneath the long, glossy talons of many a Regina. But the jokes, poses and put-downs that Regina delivers and inspires in others in this musical, adapted from the 2004 film, are a lot more entertaining than the more earnestly aspirational doings of the heroines of ""Frozen,"" ""Anastasia"" and, their deathless sorority founder, ""Wicked."" That's because Regina and her frenemies converse in dialogue by the peerless comic writer Tina Fey.

That perspective was transformed into box-office gold in the film ""Mean Girls,"" Ms. Fey's first screenplay, based on a nonfiction book about the perils of popularity by Rosalind Wiseman and directed by Mark Waters. Starring a young Lindsay Lohan as an outsider who insinuates herself into a high school ""in"" crowd and loses her identity (a part ably assumed in the musical by Erika Henningsen), the film balanced every-nerd revenge fantasies with sunny life lessons, and it lives on as a mood-elevating cult favorite. Fans of that movie will be happy to learn that Ms. Fey's script for the protracted stage incarnation -- which features songs by Jeff Richmond and Nell Benjamin, with direction and choreography by Casey Nicholaw -- retains many of the oft-quoted catchwords and quips of the original. When early in the show, a character hopefully says ""fetch"" (a neologism for really cool), the audience is chuckling before she lands that final ""ch."" As for me, I was laughing guiltily even before the show started, gazing at the onstage video wallpaper of annotated yearbook photographs. Representing the title characters' so-called ""Burn Book,"" which figures in a crucial plot point, these are images of class portraits decorated with cruel phrases like ""If cornflakes were a person"" and ""Only made the team because his mom slept with the coach.""

That this ""Mean Girls"" takes place (still at an Illinois high school) 14 years later than the film has proved no obstacle to Ms. Fey. After all, social media only increases opportunities for social climbing and subversion. The disconnect that troubles this musical isn't a matter of adapting to changing times. Scott Pask's set, Gregg Barnes's costumes and Finn Ross and Adam Young's video designs render sociological exactitude with flat comic-strip brightness. No, the trouble lies in the less assured translation of Ms. Fey's sly take on adolescent social angst into crowd-pleasing song and dance. Mr. Richmond and Ms. Benjamin's many (many) musical numbers are passable by middle-of-the-road Broadway standards (though Ms. Benjamin's shoehorned rhymes do not bear close examination). Yet they rarely capture either the tone or the time of being a certain age in a certain era. A couple of songs tip their caps to Katy Perry/Pink-style ballads of empowerment (""It Roars,"" ""Fearless""), but they lack the energizing pop snap you long for.

A rap number, for a party sequence, is embarrassing, and not only because it's intended to be. By the end, when the feuding students have learned the errors of their divergent ways, high-volume hymns of uplift have taken over. Only an occasional number -- like ""What's Wrong With Me?,"" a cri de coeur of insecurity, affectingly performed by Ashley Park -- offers essential insights into character or truly propels the plot. These songs are why the show weighs in at two and a half hours, as opposed to the movie's zippy 97 minutes. And often when I sensed that a character was feeling a song coming on, a grumpy voice in me murmured, ""Oh, I wish you wouldn't.""

As long as they're talking, the leading students of ""Mean Girls"" exude an idiosyncratic, carefully exaggerated comic charm. You have, on the one hand, the designer-garbed despots of the title: Ms. Louderman's Regina, Ms. Park's terminally insecure Gretchen and Kate Rockwell's terminally stupid Karen. On the other, there are the ""Freaks and Geeks"" misfits: Grey Henson's ""almost too gay to function"" Damian and Barrett Wilbert Weed's deadpan goth-girl Janis. Kerry Butler is very funny as a variety of grown-ups (including parts portrayed by Ms. Fey and Amy Poehler in the film).

Ms. Henningsen's Cady, the new girl (she was home-schooled in Kenya by her parents), is less specifically defined, but she has plenty of presence. Her radiant, confused blankness effectively summons memories of being young, unformed and desperate to be liked. The show itself suffers from a similar indecisiveness, especially in its structure. It employs two separate, fitfully used framing perspectives -- that of Damian and Janis as droll narrators and commentators on the action, and of Cady, who grew up in the wilds of Kenya, and sometimes observes her fellow students as if they were zoological specimens. At some point, a choice between these two should have been made. As he demonstrated in ""The Book of Mormon"" and ""The Drowsy Chaperone,"" Mr. Nicholaw specializes in spoof choreography that both celebrates and satirizes Broadway dance conventions. It's an approach that feels only intermittently appropriate here. He does an amusing, if underdeveloped, riff on ""The Lion King"" and borrows from ""Mormon"" for the production's showstopper, a tap sequence called, uh, ""Stop."" The wittiest musical moments include a Halloween-party number in which young women defend tarty costumes as emblems of feminist independence.","Tina Fey's adaptation of her 2004 screenplay about high school cliques comes to Broadway with wit, fetch and a surplus of songs.",363566c7-5cdb-5129-ba27-91420f003a4f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/09/arts/09MEANGIRLS1/09MEANGIRLS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=804356a0b50f7bf5bc33858e2944de4e547ded98bda1794f2f9cdfb73c6136cc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Erika Henningsen as Cady Heron in the musical &ldquo;Mean Girls,&rdquo; adapted by Tina Fey from her screenplay for the cult-favorite 2004 film.",363566c7-5cdb-5129-ba27-91420f003a4f,N24News/imgs/363566c7-5cdb-5129-ba27-91420f003a4f.jpg,10
Your Money,Judges Rebuke Limits on Wiping Out Student Loan Debt,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/18/your-money/student-loans/judges-rebuke-limits-on-wiping-out-student-loan-debt.html,"On a typical day in her last job, Janet Roth left home at 4 a.m. each day and drove 40 miles to a tax preparation office in Glendale, Ariz. When she finally got back home, she had less than an hour before starting her 6 p.m. shift decorating cakes at Walmart. She worked until midnight, giving her just a few hours to sleep before starting all over again. Ms. Roth, 68, worked in many jobs over the years, but she never made quite enough to pay back the $33,000 she borrowed years earlier for an education degree she couldn't afford to complete, and certainly not the $95,000 it ballooned to in default. She filed for bankruptcy, wiping out five figures in medical debts. But erasing student loans requires initiating a separate legal process, where borrowers must prove that paying the debt would cause an ""undue hardship."" To prepare her case, she copied down statutes at a local law library and watched episodes of ""Law and Order."" Her efforts paid off: Ms. Roth's loans were discharged in 2013.

That Ms. Roth, now living on Social Security, managed to succeed in what is known as a notoriously difficult process is not even the most remarkable aspect of her case. Instead, the ruling captured the attention of other judges and legal scholars because of a judge's bluntly worded written opinion that rebuked the widely adopted hardship standard used to determine whether a debtor is worthy of a discharge. The judge, Jim D. Pappas, in his concurring opinion for the bankruptcy appellate panel decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, said the analysis used ""to determine the existence of an undue hardship is too narrow, no longer reflects reality and should be revised."" He added: ""It would seem that in this new, different environment, in determining whether repayment of a student loan constitutes an undue hardship, a bankruptcy court should be afforded flexibility to consider all relevant facts about the debtor and the subject loans."" But the current standard, he wrote, ""does not allow it."" Judge Pappas isn't the only critic. Although plenty of cases still hew closely to a strict interpretation of the test, some judges and courts have signaled in recent years that they believe the rigid standard -- known as the Brunner test -- should be reconsidered, even if they are still bound to it now.

Because the bankruptcy code never defined ""undue hardship,"" the courts needed to develop their own definition. Most courts adopted the Brunner test, which originated from a precedent-setting ruling in 1987, in which a woman named Marie Brunner filed for a discharge of her debt less than a year after she completed a master's degree. To stop debtors from trying to prematurely cancel their debts, the case laid out a three-pronged test: Individuals must prove they made a good-faith effort to pay the loan by finding work and minimizing their expenses. Debtors must also show they could not maintain a minimal standard of living based on their income and expenses if they had to repay the debt. But then, in arguably the most challenging prong, the court must consider whether that situation is likely to persist for a significant part of the repayment period -- which essentially requires the judge to predict the debtor's future, ensuring what some courts have described as a ""certainty of hopelessness."" ""How do you prove things won't change for the better in the future?"" said Daniel A. Austin, associate professor at Northeastern University School of Law. Bankruptcy scholars and judges said the test made sense at the time it was adopted because even if debtors could not pass the test, their debts -- which were far more modest then -- would automatically be discharged in bankruptcy five years after their repayment period started. But the legal landscape has changed substantially since then. Before 1977, student loans could be discharged in bankruptcy alongside other debts like credit card balances. Congress toughened the law in 1976, adding the five-year period, and again in 1990, when the waiting period was extended to seven years.

In 1998, the waiting period was eliminated. So now, all debtors must prove undue hardship to erase their student debts. (In 2005, Congress added private student loans to the mix of federal education debt that could not be discharged, even though the loans are not backed by the government.) ""You can see why courts would have developed a harsh standard in those cases where consumers had sought discharge of loans soon after they came due, without waiting five or seven years,"" said John Rao, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center. ""But it is kind of ridiculous to be applying the same standard now when there is no longer a right to an automatic discharge."" Another noteworthy case, also from 2013, involved a ""destitute"" paralegal named Susan Krieger, then about 53, who lived in a rural area of Illinois with her mother, according to court documents. Ms. Krieger received a bachelor's degree in legal studies and a paralegal certificate, graduating when she was 43. But after a decade-long search, she couldn't find a job. The Educational Credit Management Corporation, the guaranty agency hired to battle student debtors in court, argued that Ms. Krieger should enroll in an income-based repayment program, even though she probably wouldn't end up paying anything. Ms. Krieger's remaining balance of about $25,000 was eventually discharged.

But it was the written opinion of a well-regarded judge in the Krieger case, questioning the application of the Brunner test, that has been repeatedly cited by other judges. In the ruling, Frank H. Easterbrook, then chief judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, seemed to signal that requiring debtors to prove their futures were ""hopeless"" was taking the undue hardship standard too far. He wrote that it was important not to allow ""judicial glosses,"" like the language in the Brunner case, ""to supersede the statute itself.""

Rafael I. Pardo, a bankruptcy law professor at Emory Law, said Judge Easterbrook's opinion was a reminder to other courts that carried a lot of weight. ""If this highly respected, highly cerebral conservative judge is saying this, that is a big deal,"" he added. ""It is a clarion call that some judges should be more forgiving when applying the law."" Judge Easterbrook and Judge Pappas weren't the first to criticize the Brunner standard. That distinction may belong to Judge James B. Haines Jr., who spent 25 years as federal bankruptcy judge in Maine before retiring in 2013. In an opinion in 2000, he said that some courts reach too far in trying to define undue hardship. He said he never felt shackled by Brunner's three-prong test because the higher court in his jurisdiction never adopted that standard, leaving him free to consider another standard, whereby judges can consider the ""totality of the circumstances."" ""Throughout my time on the bench, I heard many student loan cases,"" said Judge Haines, now a professor at Maine University School of Law. ""The totality of the circumstances test gave me sufficient structure, with a fair ability to balance all pertinent facts."" Many of those facts have become more dire over the last decade. Among debtors filing for bankruptcy with student loans, the average amount of student debt has doubled to nearly $31,000 in 2014 from $15,350 in 2005, according to an analysis by Professor Austin of Northeastern. But perhaps more important, student loans as a percentage of the filer's annual gross income have also increased substantially. In 2014, 16 percent of all bankruptcy filers had student loans that totaled more than 50 percent of their annual income, compared with 5.4 percent in 2005. This year, President Obama instructed several governmental agencies to review, by Oct. 1, whether the treatment of student loans in bankruptcy should be altered. Congress could tweak the bankruptcy code, perhaps reinstating a waiting period before debts can be canceled. Judge Kaplan, in New Jersey, said perhaps 10 or 15 years was the right number. Otherwise, the existing hardship standard could be overridden if a circuit court hears a case en banc, meaning all of the judges in a circuit decide together. All of those are long shots, for the time being. A larger part of the problem is that only a tiny percentage of debtors attempt to discharge their student loans in bankruptcy, perhaps because of the perception that it isn't possible or is too hard. But debtors' best chance at having their student loans wiped away may simply be to try.","Erasing student loans requires proof that paying the debt would cause ""undue hardship,"" and some judges think the rigid standard should be reconsidered.",b308103b-6ddc-5861-b423-5246db3572c9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/18/business/18money-websub/18money-websub-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=d79400204c29733578e9b32445bc726e3ece2f15cec4b2a3eeb016ca66c93dd2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The bankruptcy case of Janet Roth stirred a debate over the rigidity of the ""undue hardship"" standard in discharging student loans.",b308103b-6ddc-5861-b423-5246db3572c9,N24News/imgs/b308103b-6ddc-5861-b423-5246db3572c9.jpg,21
Media,"Three Top Executives Are Out at WarnerMedia, HBO's Parent Company",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/business/media/hbo-warnermedia-executive-departure.html,"In a sudden shake-up at one of Hollywood's biggest companies, three top executives have left WarnerMedia, the AT&T division that houses HBO and the streaming service HBO Max, the company announced on Friday. The surprise moves came three months into the tenure of the WarnerMedia chief executive, Jason Kilar, who has wasted little time putting his stamp on the company. Robert Greenblatt, the chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment, is out after little more than a year on the job. Kevin Reilly, WarnerMedia's chief content officer, is also departing, as is Keith Cocozza, the executive vice president of marketing and communications, who worked at the company for 19 years. Asked about the departures, Mr. Kilar said in a phone interview on Friday: ""Disciplined companies have to make tough decisions.""

In a note to WarnerMedia employees that announced the moves, Mr. Kilar said the company would emphasize HBO Max. The company unveiled the streaming platform on May 27 in a crowded field that includes Netflix, with its 193 million subscribers, as well as Amazon Prime Video, Hulu and the relative newcomers Disney+, AppleTV+ and NBCUniversal's Peacock. ""We are elevating HBO Max in the organization and expanding its scope globally,"" Mr. Kilar wrote. With Mr. Greenblatt and Mr. Reilly gone, Mr. Kilar has given more responsibility to two WarnerMedia executives, Ann Sarnoff, who joined the company in June as the chief executive of the Warner Bros., and Andy Forssell, the general manager of HBO Max. In addition to overseeing the Warner Bros. movie and television studio, Ms. Sarnoff will lead a new unit, the studios and networks group, which brings together the company's original productions, including programming for HBO, HBO Max and the cable channels TNT, TBS and TruTV. Ms. Sarnoff, who has had leadership roles at Nickelodeon, the Women's National Basketball Association, Dow Jones and BBC America, will also be in charge of TV series made for WarnerMedia. Her business partner will bet Mr. Forssell, Mr. Kilar's former colleague at Hulu, who will report directly to the chief executive. A longtime HBO executive, Casey Bloys, was also promoted. In addition to heading original content at HBO, he will be in charge of original programming for HBO Max, TNT, TBS and TruTV. He will report to Ms. Sarnoff.

Jeff Zucker, the longtime CNN head, was unaffected. Under Mr. Kilar, he remains the chairman of WarnerMedia's news and sports units. Christy Haubegger, the chief enterprise inclusion officer, will take over Mr. Cocozza's role of overseeing the global marketing and communications team.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Mr. Kilar, 48, who came to WarnerMedia after a stint at Amazon, was appointed to his job by John Stankey, a veteran AT&T executive who ran WarnerMedia from June 2018 until May 1. Mr. Stankey became the chief executive of AT&T on July 1, replacing Randall L. Stephenson.

In the entertainment world, Mr. Kilar was considered a thoughtful executive who happened to be the chief executive (and chief architect) of Hulu when streaming was still a novelty. With his bold restructuring on Friday, he has gained a reputation as a forceful Hollywood player. The changes at WarnerMedia broke apart the team Mr. Stankey had assembled last year, when he ran the division after a three-decade career spent mostly in telecommunications. In a resignation that got the attention of media insiders, Richard Plepler, the longtime head of HBO who led the network to 160 Emmys, left the company in February 2019. Mr. Stankey effectively replaced him with Mr. Greenblatt, who named Mr. Reilly, the onetime leader of the cable channels TNT and TBS, as WarnerMedia's head of content. Despite his evangelism for HBO Max and all things digital, Mr. Kilar said he was a believer in the traditional moviegoing experience. ""Tenet,"" the much-anticipated Warner Bros. sci-fi film directed by Christopher Nolan, is still on the schedule for a Labor Day release. But Mr. Kilar noted that, even before the pandemic shut down theaters nationwide, the movie business was moving away from long theatrical runs.

""For anyone to suggest that the theatrical construct isn't going to change over the next few years I think is not paying close attention,"" he said. ""There will be shortened windows. But in no way is Warner Media stepping away from the deep embrace of theatrical exhibition."" Mr. Kilar declined to comment on whether Warner Bros. would consider something like the deal AMC Entertainment signed last month with Universal Pictures. Under the arrangement, Universal agreed to shorten the theatrical window to 17 days, down from the industry norm of 90 days, and give AMC a share of video-on-demand revenue. The rise of digital media has profoundly altered the entertainment business, Mr. Kilar said, putting the studios in a position to distribute their films and TV shows to audiences without having to rely on other companies. ""If you take a look at the history of WarnerMedia, or any media company, they largely had a history of wholesaling,"" he said in the interview. ""They produce amazing stories, amazing content, and then work with partners who then interact with consumers. The gift that is the internet changes all of that. Suddenly, there is an opportunity to go direct to consumers, which I think is one of the biggest opportunities in the history of media.""","The shake-up came on the watch of the WarnerMedia chief executive, Jason Kilar, who joined the company in May.",42c50013-b5f8-5628-8e88-63cc628f50c9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/08/business/07HBO1-print/merlin_137565399_b34b5a2a-f0da-40b5-891b-d7507abfd280-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=74cb84801f658ca4d0591c93d40eb61376afcd717d5482c1766e210b7f36b6ae&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Robert Greenblatt, who was named the chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment last year, is one of three executives leaving the company.",42c50013-b5f8-5628-8e88-63cc628f50c9,N24News/imgs/42c50013-b5f8-5628-8e88-63cc628f50c9.jpg,16
Global Business,Nespresso and Rivals Vie for Dominance in Coffee War,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/21/business/global/21coffee.html,"PARIS -- George Clooney and John Malkovich aren't the only coffee lovers fighting over a Nespresso these days. A coffee war has broken out in Europe pitting the Swiss food giant Nestle against the struggling American food group Sara Lee as well as a former Nestle executive. They are at odds over the worldwide monopoly Nespresso has long held on the lucrative espresso pods that fit its coffee-making machines. Helping propel its popularity in Europe is a sleekly wry English-language ad campaign featuring Mr. Clooney and Mr. Malkovich. With billions at stake, Nespresso has sued its rivals, accusing them of making cheaper copycat pods that violate the intellectual property it created in developing a system to make a convenient homemade cup of espresso that it claims can best a barista.

The first court test could begin next month here, where Nespresso's competitors recently put their pods on grocery store shelves in hopes of establishing a beachhead to make inroads throughout Europe and into the United States. ""Nestle has spent millions of dollars on innovation and research in Nespresso over many years,"" said Richard Girardot, chief executive of Nestle Nespresso. ""So when someone comes along with a pure copy of the product, we have to protect ourselves."" But Nespresso's rivals say that Nestle is trying to lock them out of one of the fastest-growing segments of the coffee market: pods now account for 20 to 40 percent of the value of ground coffee sales in the $17 billion European coffee market, according to Euromonitor International. ""What they're doing is similar to Hewlett-Packard or Epson trying to forbid generic cartridges,"" said Jean-Paul Gaillard, who ran Nespresso for a decade but who now is being sued by Nestle for devising a biodegradable version of its capsule. ""They are trying to stop copies -- but our product is not a copy,"" he said. Competitors have emerged to other single-serve coffee products, but Nestle is the first to take legal action to try to ward generics away from the gold mine of coffee by the pod.

Sales have leapt 30 percent a year, on average, over the last decade, ever since Nespresso underwent an aggressive makeover that transformed it from a humdrum office coffee product to a must-have item among chic urbanites. Through star-studded advertising in Europe and Asia and a growing network of clubby boutiques now numbering 200, it lures upscale customers, whether in New York, Paris or Shanghai. Since 2000, when Nespresso started to break even, the company has sold more than 20 billion capsules through its boutiques and Web site at about 43 to 62 cents apiece. The price of its machines start around $190 and soar beyond $2,500. Given similar projections for future growth, others started trying to angle in. Nestle has not made that easy: it owns the patents -- 1,700 of them -- on its personal espresso system, which Mr. Malkovich, playing God in Nespresso's most recent European ads, trades for Mr. Clooney's soul. Many of the patents are set to expire in 2012, and Nestle has been working on other ways to prevent competitors from hacking a system that uses unique water dynamics to pump an espresso kissed with foam out of a hermetically sealed aluminum capsule. Sara Lee, which has been trying since 2005 to engineer a recovery, recently broke through. In mid-July, it put its own plastic perforated version of the capsule, the L'Or, in French supermarkets, at a price of 37 cents. So far, it has sold 30 million capsules, a spokesman said.

""Coffee is Sara Lee's No. 1 business; it accounts for well over 50 percent of their earnings,"" said Tim Ramey, an analyst at D. A. Davidson & Company in Portland, Ore. ""The single-serve coffee business is the piece that's growing fast, so it's important for them."" Sara Lee has its own low-cost version of a personal espresso machine, the Senseo, whose pods alone had sales of $555 million in the fiscal year that ended June 30. Senseo is a top seller in the American market and a rival to other single-serve coffees in the United States, like Green Mountain. About 27 million Senseo machines were sold in the last decade, compared to about eight million Nespresso machines. But the real gold mine is in pods. Sara Lee insists that its capsules do not violate Nestle's patents. ""In terms of shape, size, color, material -- the whole product is different,"" said Ernesto Duran, a spokesman for Sara Lee. If Sara Lee is confident, so is Mr. Gaillard, who started the Ethical Coffee Company three years ago to grab a piece of a market he knows inside out. He takes credit for dreaming up the way to make Nespresso a breakthrough product when he was the top executive there from 1988 to 1997, a claim that elicits long moments of silence from current executives. ""I wanted to create the Chanel of coffee, and decided to make Nespresso chic and bobo,"" he said. ""The idea was to keep it to the level of people who have a doorman.""

""I started looking at the Nespresso patents, and I said, 'My God, there is something I can do even better which they did not see.' "" He started manufacturing a biodegradable capsule that sells for about 32 cents and whose water-flow dynamics, he said, were different from Nespresso's and did not pollute the way aluminum and plastic capsules did. Soon after his pods hit the shelves of the French supermarket Casino, he said Nestle representatives paid one of its stores a visit. ""A few guys came to the store and said, 'We want 2,000 capsules.' When the manager asked why, they said they were from Nestle and had the right to buy,"" Mr. Gaillard said. Last month, Nestle persuaded the French police to raid two factories to seize more Ethical Coffee capsules; 35 million have been sold since the end of May. ""Nestle is not sitting back at all,"" said Richard Withagen, an analyst at SNS Securities in Amsterdam. ""They are fighting the entry of Sara Lee and Mr. Gaillard, and they are also working on new patents and a new kind of machine for the future."" Until the courts rule, each company is trying to persuade consumers that their coffee is king. All three cite tests they claim show that theirs tastes best. There are even several gushing Nespresso blogs that appear to be independent, but which Mr. Gaillard notes all vote down the taste of rival pods, often using strikingly similar language.

Whatever the taste, any competitor might still have to work hard to attract the type of shopper willing to spend a few hundred dollars for a sleek Nespresso machine and entree to its boutiques. Remy Romana, 26, walked out of a store on the Avenue Victor Hugo in Paris recently with $120 worth of capsules, enough for a few weeks. ""Most of my friends have a Nespresso machine, especially in Paris,"" he said. He recently tried a L'Or capsule and found the taste ""a little less good"" than Nespresso. A price difference of about 6 cents, he said, was not enough to make him give up the pampered atmosphere of buying pods in Nespresso's stores.

Your Money,The Risks and Rewards of Self-Managing Investment Portfolios,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/23/your-money/the-risks-and-rewards-of-self-managing-investment-portfolios.html,"WHEN Ken Kavula of Genesee, Mich., retired from his job as a high school principal at age 53, he decided to defy conventional wisdom and manage his own financial life -- including his retirement accounts and a mix of stocks and bonds he had either accumulated on his own or inherited. Fifteen years later, Mr. Kavula, now 68, has ridden the huge highs and crushing lows of the markets so well that he has enough to live off, for now, without even tapping some accounts. Although he had no professional money management experience or investment credentials, he was far from a newbie to the complexities of financial management when he retired. He had been studying investing for years and had been a member of several investment clubs since the late 1980s. ""That gave me confidence I could make money on the money I had,"" Mr. Kavula said. There are good reasons for retirees to manage their own financial lives: Saving money on fees is one benefit, and more closely aligning investments with personal goals is another.

But there is dangerous ground along the way: Taxes, estate planning, rules around gifting to relatives, timing of withdrawals from retirement accounts and other issues can be immensely complex and are getting more so. Although retirement confidence has been rising somewhat since the end of the last recession, it's still shaky. A recent Deloitte Center for Financial Services studyfound that ""45 percent of respondents felt 'very secure' in having enough savings and income to maintain a comfortable retirement lifestyle, a sizable jump from the 28 percent in Deloitte's initial survey in 2012."" For those who are reluctant to go it entirely alone, a growing alternative for retirees is the model of do-it-yourself investing done through so-called robo-advisers. After you enter your risk tolerance and other information in an online form, a software program automatically creates a portfolio of low-cost exchange-traded funds. It's a way to avoid paying commissions or being tempted by brokers pushing you into investments you do not quite understand. Betterment, Personal Capital and Wealthfront started the robo-adviser model. Not to be outdone, more traditional firms have entered the arena. The discount broker Charles Schwab, for example, introduced its Intelligent Portfolios robo-adviser in March. Yet the new generation of automated portfolio managers may not be suitable for retirees who have complex financial needs.

One of the biggest concerns that human advisers have when it comes to their algorithmic alternatives is how investors will use them during market downturns. Skittish retirees may make some costly timing decisions by selling at the wrong time. ""These programs are still in their infancy, said Tom Balcom, of 1650 Wealth Management in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Fla. ""Will investors sell out and change portfolio allocations when they're scared?"" Another issue retirees can face is how to make withdrawals from retirement accounts in the way that minimizes taxes. Given the choice of withdrawing funds from a 401(k), Roth I.R.A. or a conventional I.R.A., for example, which would produce income subject to the lowest tax? Few, if any, robo-advisers provide this service, and it is a difficult question for investors, although some automated options do provide tax-loss harvesting services to lower tax bills.
* Locast, a nonprofit streaming service for local TV, is shutting down
* Capital One's chief executive was fined after being called a 'repeat offender.' But financial transactions with large tax implications often need the guidance of someone with extensive experience in financial planning, especially for investors with multiple retirement accounts. ""I had a 62-year-old client who retired and went to a discount broker,"" said Carolyn Walder, a certified financial planner with Lifetime Wealth Planning and Management in Alexandria, Va. ""They advised him to take his income from his I.R.A. instead of from his individual brokerage account, which had a lot of capital losses built up from the 2000 to 2002 tech debacle,"" Ms. Walder added. ""That move cost him about $15,000 in taxes that he did not have to take. They were doing it all wrong."" But advisers might create more problems than they solve, in addition to costing more than the solo strategy. Roy Chastain, 69, who had retired from his job as a lawyer for the state of California, originally chose to work with a large brokerage adviser, but called it a ""disaster.""

""I didn't have a large portfolio, and they offered me products and limited advice,"" recalled Mr. Chastain, who lives in Sacramento. ""They were more salesmen than analysts."" Like Mr. Kavula, he now manages his own portfolio of individual stocks, mutual and exchange-traded funds. He has been a member of an investment club since 1994. A solution could be to combine do-it-yourself management with human help, by using an adviser to set up a portfolio that you would then monitor and control. This approach, using a mix of E.T.F.s and mutual funds, can save money in fees, but the price goes up if you give in to likely efforts from advisers to push you toward more active management. ""Brokers have an incentive to go to active management to add value,"" said Chris Chen, a fee-only adviser with Insight Financial Strategists in Waltham, Mass. That often translates into higher fees and expensive mistakes. Mr. Chen said that when one of his clients was with another broker, ""he paid 2.7 percent in fees, which included advisory and mutual fund expenses,"" he said. This compares ""to about 1 percent to 1.2 percent annually for an E.T.F. portfolio that includes advisory fees and E.T.F. costs. A lot of decisions go into constructing a portfolio. There are so many moving parts."" Yet another option is a model that combines the call-in services of a financial adviser with the ability to use online tools. Such a hybrid model was recently announced by the Vanguard Group, the large mutual fund company. Vanguard's Personal Advisor Services, available to clients with at least $50,000 in assets, charges a 0.30 percent annual advisory fee, in addition to mutual fund or E.T.F. management expenses ranging from 0.05 percent to 0.19 percent annually.

Still, there's nothing wrong with managing your own low-cost portfolio, as long as you understand the risk involved and can find help for any additional financial concerns. Before setting out on your own, it is wise to ask -- and answer -- several questions to determine what you'll need to complement your financial skill set. ""What's the complexity of your needs?"" asked Robert Stammers, director of investor education for the CFA Institute, a group that represents investment professionals. ""What's the cost of making a potential mistake?"" For example, what if you need to integrate an investment strategy with a tax and estate plan? You will probably need to work with an estate planning lawyer and financial adviser to ensure that everything aligns with your intentions. You will also need to be honest about your ability to confidently stick to your investment policy, which is a written plan on how much risk you want to take in all market conditions. Will you sell when the market goes south or buy more stocks? There are many tools online that will help you make the best spending, withdrawal and tax decisions on your own. One resource is the nonprofit group BetterInvesting, which provides educational support on stock investing and investment clubs, and which has chapters around the country. But advisers say a little bit of hand-holding can go a long way, as can joining forces with other investors. For his part, Mr. Kavula, who speaks across the United States to help educate investors, has joined clubs affiliated with BetterInvesting. His advice? ""Don't try to hit a home run and don't be greedy. Be patient on your way to investing. People heading in and out of the market won't be successful.""","Retirees who make their own investment decisions save money on fees, but face complex questions on taxes and estate planning.

Music,How a Digital Rabbit Hole Gave Midori Takada's 1983 Album a Second Life,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/arts/music/midori-takada-through-the-looking-glass.html,"YouTube is known for shining a spotlight on viral stars, but sometimes it can act more like a hip record store clerk, digging in the crates. Five years ago, if you clicked on a video for Brian Eno, '80s new age or spiritual jazz, the site's recommendation algorithm directed you next to an obscure and mysterious pick: a Japanese modern classical album from 1983 titled ""Through the Looking Glass."" It was the work of the Japanese percussionist and composer Midori Takada, and while little was known about her in the United States, the video soon topped over two million views. (It has since been taken down over a copyright violation.) Original vinyl copies of the album started fetching over $1,000. ""I didn't know about her music when I grew up in Japan,"" said Miho Hatori of the duo Cibo Matto, who first learned of Ms. Takada from that YouTube algorithm. ""But Midori's music has the energy of the spirit of the early '80s when music and culture was changing in Japan.""

Such a renaissance was news to Ms. Takada. ""I didn't know about that YouTube video, because I don't do social media; even a PC, I didn't have one,"" the musician, 66, said by telephone from Los Angeles, where she was about to embark on her first United States tour. (She makes her New York solo debut this week.) ""After recording 'Through the Looking Glass,' I knew that my music was not popular, so there was no offer to make a new one.""

""Anything ambient, Japanese, electronic or vaguely related was linking to this video,"" said Jacob Gorchov, who runs the Palto Flats label and reissued Ms. Takada's enigmatic album last year in conjunction with the Swiss label WRWTFWW Records. It became the No. 2-selling album at the online retailer Discogs for 2017, behind only Radiohead's ""OK Computer."" In the wake of the YouTube video's popularity, Ms. Takada has toured Europe multiple times and her other albums have been reissued in the last year; next month a reissue of her short-lived first band, Mkwaju Ensemble, will be released as well. Classically trained as a percussionist, Ms. Takada originally performed in the Berlin RIAS Symphonie-Orchester at the start of her career in the mid-1970s, but soon found herself dissatisfied with the Western classical musical tradition. ""If I continued to play westernized contemporary music, it needed many more instruments like an orchestra,"" Ms. Takada said. Instead, she gravitated to the Minimalism of composers like Steve Reich and Terry Riley. And much like these composers, she was also interested in African drumming and Indonesian gamelan. In these unfussy world music sounds she heard something far more abundant. ""People say it's poor, but from very few materials, they produce rich sounds just using their body and hands,"" she said. ""How to make a worldly sound by your body and with simple materials was an important thing to me."" Unable to learn much about African music in Japan, Ms. Takada instead studied African drumming by way of two albums of field recordings, from Tanzania and Zimbabwe. ""I copied from the vinyl, writing down the rhythm structures, and tried it by myself,"" she said of her rigorous daily practice to learn polyrhythms, likening it to a daily mantra. ""It changed my body.""

In January 1983, she went into the studio for two days. The album was an arduous process, with Ms. Takada composing, producing, arranging the microphones and playing everything on it, from marimba to drums, harmonium to Coke bottle. The end result is a fascinating mix of contemplative ambience and childlike wonder, building up to the intensifying polyrhythms at its thunderous climax. ""It required great concentration to make all the sounds, four pieces recorded in two days,"" she said. Marketed as a modern classical recording, it did not sell well at the time and Ms. Takada would not record another solo album until 1999. In the years between, she performed in various ensembles, composed for the theater director Tadashi Suzuki and his Suzuki Company of Toga, and taught music theory, environmental formative theory and percussion at various universities in Tokyo. So why did the sounds of ""Through the Looking Glass"" connect with listeners so recently? ""Midori Takada's music sounded so pure and new that despite it being three decades on, her sense of rhythm and space ticks all of today's boxes,"" the BBC radio host and D.J. Gilles Peterson said in an email. Ms. Takada said new audiences in the West don't change her approach. ""Whether in Europe, Africa, Asia or U.S.A., it doesn't matter, each person is important,"" she said. ""My vision is to give individually my sound to everyone."" She added that she named the album after the famous Lewis Carroll book not because of the protagonist Alice, but because of the story's reversal of time. ""I made the album as a perspective of sounds, so when this new generation listened, they felt something different, recognizing the space,"" she said. ""Nowadays it's easy to play it by electronics, but I played it myself by hand. Even the staff at the studio couldn't understand it. I was misunderstood.""","""Through the Looking Glass"" sold poorly upon its release, but a YouTube algorithm later brought it fresh attention; now the Japanese musician is on a U.S. tour.",a8f7293f-dff2-5ba9-a884-1495bcd7bb8d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/22/arts/22takada1/22takada1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=db9e9d6b73c860234fecde2dfbf2f344fdf6479356ba68a1393c021d61909690&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Japanese composer and percussionist Midori Takada released ""Through the Looking Glass"" in 1983.

Autrey ruled Monday that flashing high beams to warn other motorists of a speed trap is not only not illegal, but could be considered a form of communication, therefore linked to the First Amendment right to free speech. The Ellisville, Mo., police issued a $1,000 citation to Michael Elli for flashing his lights to warn of a speed trap. Mr. Elli sued Ellisville with the help of a lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union. (Reason)

# Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced Tuesday that its 2014 Ram 1500 EcoDiesel pickup truck received an E.P.A. highway fuel-economy rating of 28 miles per gallon. Although Ram is the first marque to offer a turbodiesel option in the half-ton segment in the United States, Nissan said in August that it would begin selling a diesel version of its Titan pickup, possibly next year.

The survey asked 1,700 randomly selected auto owners to rank automakers based on style, performance, quality, safety, technology, value and fuel economy. (Consumer Reports)

# A study published recently by Alix Partners, a consulting firm, says that car-sharing services are impacting new car sales.

Opinion,Who's Really Shredding Standards on Capitol Hill?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/09/opinion/rand-paul-whistleblower.html,"But was it? Not by a long shot; when it comes to misconduct, Congress has a long history. Congressmen have pulled guns on each other. They've shoved and punched each other, and smacked at foes with fireplace tongs. They've engaged in mass brawls, toppling desks, tossing spittoons and, in one case, yanking off a toupee. The most famous violence in congressional history is the caning of the abolitionist Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts by Representative Preston Brooks of South Carolina on the Senate floor in 1856, but it was not an anomaly.

Nor is Ms. Pelosi alone in violating traditions for all to see; it was far from the first time that members of Congress met alleged lies with bold displays of open contempt. In 1790, Representative Aedanus Burke of South Carolina showed his feelings with a flourish after Alexander Hamilton, the Treasury secretary, slurred the Southern militia during an Independence Day speech. Hamilton had said that Southern troops were dispirited and in disarray before the arrival of Gen. Nathanael Greene. Burke -- outraged and hoping to impress folks back home -- used the theater of Congress to have his say. Turning toward the visitor gallery, he declared, ""In the face of this assembly and in the presence of this gallery ... I give the lie to Colonel Hamilton."" Onlookers were stunned.

Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas did much the same when President Obama discussed his health care plan before the House in 2009, waving a handwritten sign that read, ""What Plan?"" ""The things he was saying were certainly not true of the only bill we had at the time,"" Mr. Gohmert later said. On that same night, Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina shouted ""You lie!"" at the president for a similar reason.

By far, the most skilled practitioners of this showy statecraft were Southern slaveholders in the decades leading up to the Civil War. Threatened by even the hint of opposition to slavery, they used bold public threats during debate to frighten their foes into compliance or silence, tossing off insults or dangling duel challenges to set an example. Faced with the choice of a fistfight or a duel -- or the humiliation of avoiding one -- most men backed down or held back. For Southerners, transgressing rules was part of the point; it was a show of power.

Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky used the same form of showmanship when he exposed the alleged whistle-blower's name during impeachment proceedings last Tuesday. Days after Chief Justice John Roberts refused to read a question from Mr. Paul that revealed the name, Mr. Paul did the deed himself. During a period reserved for impeachment speeches, he read his question aloud while standing next to a large blue poster with the name in bold yellow, endangering the whistle-blower and violating the spirit of whistle-blower protection laws in the process; although those laws are meant to protect informants from retaliation, they don't explicitly stop members of Congress or the president from revealing names. Tradition and ethics alone keep them silent.",Naming the alleged whistle-blower is much worse than tearing up a speech.,cd2ea3e1-9a9e-570a-9927-872abd83341c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/10/opinion/10Freeman2/10Freeman2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=0f055521a25b953386015d5bf6d7675b60d4e76b2bb13d517d288f6346b50845&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"&ldquo;Arguments of the Chivalry,&rdquo; an illustration depicting the caning of Senator Charles Sumner by Representative Preston Brooks in 1856.",cd2ea3e1-9a9e-570a-9927-872abd83341c,N24News/imgs/cd2ea3e1-9a9e-570a-9927-872abd83341c.jpg,11

One of the glories of life in New York before Covid-19 was the vast variety of flavors you could take in over the course of a week without even entering your own kitchen. Tomatillos and Thai basil, Sichuan peppercorns and smoked salmon: It was a luxury to be able to eat them all, day to day, meal to meal.

But quarantine has brought grazing to a halt, or at least limited it considerably.

Art & Design,What to See in New York City Art Galleries This Week,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/03/arts/design/what-to-see-in-new-york-city-art-galleries-this-week.html,"Karel Funk's oil paintings remain unwavering in their concentration on well-made outerwear. At 303 Gallery, in his first gallery show in New York since 2010, Mr. Funk continues to meticulously render the heads and shoulders of subjects who have their backs to the viewer and are wearing bright nylon parkas with the hoods up, silhouetted against white. They are, in other words, complete mysteries, their distance intensified because the hoods evoke monks' or nuns' habits. As always, Mr. Funk's art has an undercurrent of religious devotion, maybe even a touch of the medieval. Our lack of connection to the sitters is strange yet liberating for all concerned. They are cloistered, not displayed for the delectation of either painter or viewer. We, too, are slightly disembodied, free to examine these faceless yet somehow individualized portraits unwatched. Though, in the palpable silence, these figures might be listening, like confessors awaiting our revelations.

There is much to look at, and think about, besides this disruption of the viewer's dominion, including the smooth, knowing perfection of the garments and their high-tech designs; the additions of rougher textures, like Velcro strips and nylon straps; the tiny stitches of their welted seams; and their effulgent colors of yellow, green, red and purple. But each color is set in motion by the quietly unruly topography of creases, sags and folds, and further subdivided by light into a tremendous variety of tones and hues. There is something of the grandeur of landscapes, even mountains or peaks. The dark concave side of a gray hood might almost be a landslide. Finally, there is the conscientious, intimate care with which Mr. Funk achieves this level of realism. Like his subjects, he is unseen, but we feel the intensity of both, along with our own.

If one way to measure the merit of a news publication is by the quality of the art that is made with, about and occasionally against it, then The New York Times is in pretty good shape. This is suggested by an outstanding show of 80 artists who use The Times as subject or material, or both, to make just about anything; commit various acts of dissection; or touch on specific events, social mores, the passage of time. The results are humorous, sobering or ingenious but rarely uninteresting. Several artists use the newspaper as a surface for drawing or painting. Rirkrit Tiravanija paints ""Tomorrow is the question"" in giant letters on a canvas covered with tear sheets from the front section of the issue of Jan. 21, 2017, the day after the inauguration of Donald J. Trump. NiiLartey De Osu, one of several artists selected from an open call, renders a large calligraphic head on a surface made from the paper's Jan. 22, 2017, report on the Women's March. Lubaina Himid, one of four artists shortlisted for the Turner Prize in Britain this year, paints or writes on gray rectangles that have been added to individual pages, extrapolating a poignant poetry, linguistic and not, from their existing headlines and images. Michael Scoggins takes issue with a front-page article on Ivanka Trump, rendering the page as a large color caricature, and inserting a reference to this show. Jennifer Dalton compares the adjectives used by The Times's art critics in their descriptions of work made by men and that by women, while Randall Rosenthal has carved and painted a trompe l'oeil wooden sculpture of The Times Magazine, open to the crossword puzzle, complete with coffee stains. In ""Future Anterior,"" from 2008, Agnieszka Kurant has created pages from 2020, whose ominous headlines include ""Russia 'Safeguards' Chinese Democracy"" and ""Inspections of Food."" This show is something of a long read, but if I do say so myself, a very lively, enlightening one.

An electric tension between graphic clarity of form and chaotic, libidinal urgency of content powers all the work in ""Easy Feelings,"" a three-person show elegantly curated by the painter James Ulmer in an artist-run space in Ridgewood, Queens. Two small drawings of demonic female nudes by June Culp look like woodblock prints of Troll dolls. The chunky figure in ""Red Cow Mules,"" in particular, done in thick blue and green lines with a kind of paint stick called a solid marker, has nipples resembling rocket ships and red accents at the tongue, crotch and toes. Emilia Brintnall's totemic black papier-mache ""Serpent"" slithers up a gallery wall with a white racing stripe down its back. Her ""Ring,"" which sits on a round dolly about eight inches off the floor, portrays a mountainous goddess-turned-landscape-turned-goddess, also in black and white, surmounted by a seven-pointed star and surrounded by seven crosses. And from Jayson Musson, best known for the brilliant series of art-world-skewering videos he made as the character Hennessy Youngman, but now returning to drawing, come two gouaches on coffee-stained paper. They are both silhouettes of armless figures in suggestively symbolic poses that might have been borrowed from a Bauhaus tarot deck. In ""Thinking Boy,"" a sky-blue character with one enormous eye curls into a kneeling position, while a black figure bent almost double, in ""Paraguay,"" strides through cascading red waves. Taken together, the six pieces emit an almost audible hum.","Among some notable works are Karel Funk's portraits of outerwear that speak volumes, and a three-person group show powered by an electric tension.",dbf1460a-f858-50fc-9bff-bfef4f2df339,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/04/arts/04galleries3/04galleries3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=371d6a593e294a69269086dd64b2ac73e7d474bf7f13b4d27b1e28facf7cf625&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Karel Funk's ""Untitled #84,"" from 2017, acrylic on panel, on display at 303 Gallery.",dbf1460a-f858-50fc-9bff-bfef4f2df339,N24News/imgs/dbf1460a-f858-50fc-9bff-bfef4f2df339.jpg,14
Technology,"Gary Starkweather, Inventor of the Laser Printer, Dies at 81",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/technology/gary-starkweather-dead.html,"Gary Starkweather, an engineer and inventor who designed the first laser printer, bringing the power of the printing press to almost anyone, died on Dec. 26 at a hospital in Orlando, Fla. He was 81. His wife, Joyce, said the cause was leukemia. Mr. Starkweather was working as a junior engineer in the offices of the Xerox Corporation in Rochester, N.Y., in 1964 -- several years after the company had introduced the photocopier to American office buildings -- when he began working on a version that could transmit information between two distant copiers, so that a person could scan a document in one place and send a copy to someone else in another. He decided that this could best be done with the precision of a laser, another recent invention, which can use amplified light to transfer images onto paper. But then he had a better idea: Rather than sending grainy images of paper documents from place to place, what if he used the precision of a laser to print more refined images straight from a computer? ""What you have to do is not just look at the marble,"" he said in a talk at the University of South Florida in 2017. ""You have to see the angel in the marble.""

Because his idea ventured away from the company's core business, copiers, his boss hated it. At one point Mr. Starkweather was told that if he did not stop working on the project, his entire team would be laid off. ""If you have a good idea, you can bet someone else doesn't think it's good,"" Mr. Starkweather would say in 1997 in a lecture for the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif. But he soon finagled a move to the company's new research lab in Northern California, where a group of visionaries was developing what would become the most important digital technologies of the next three decades, including the personal computer as it is known today. At the Palo Alto Research Center, or PARC, Mr. Starkweather built the first working laser printer in 1971 in less than nine months. By the 1990s, it was a staple of offices around the world. By the new millennium, it was nearly ubiquitous in homes as well.

Gary Keith Starkweather was born on Jan. 9, 1938, in Lansing, Mich., the only son of Richard and Crystal Starkweather. His father owned a local dairy; his mother was a homemaker. Their home was near a junk shop, where Gary would bargain for old radios, washing machines and car parts that he could tinker with in the basement, taking them apart and then putting them back together. ""As long as I didn't blow up the house, I was allowed to do whatever I wanted down there,"" he said in a 2010 interview with the Computer History Museum. While studying physics at Michigan State University, he met Joyce Attard, a nursing student two years behind him. They married in 1961 and moved to Rochester so that he could join Bausch & Lomb, which at the time made lenses for eyeglasses, cameras, microscopes and other equipment. After several of his colleagues were laid off, they moved to Xerox, and he followed them. His move to PARC came after he read about the lab in the company's newsletter. After visiting PARC in 1970, he phoned his wife in cold Rochester and asked how she felt about moving to sunny Palo Alto. Her response, he recalled, was, ""I'll have the furniture in the street by the time you get home."" As he developed his printer, his new colleagues built a personal computer that could drive it: the Alto, a machine that eventually gave rise to the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows PCs. ""One of the goals of the Alto was to build a computer that could work with images that were as flexible as those made with all the tools of graphics arts that had been developed over the previous 500 years,"" Butler Lampson, who founded the Alto project, said in an interview. ""We made it possible to do that on the screen. And Gary made it possible to take the information on the screen and put it onto paper.""","He originally received pushback from his employer, Xerox. But his invention eventually became nearly ubiquitous in every office and home.",cbb90c70-7570-5fe8-abaa-32d630ce6d9c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/16/obituaries/15Starkweather1/merlin_167121258_2aac2dab-e733-4743-aafa-8c14b048ec3f-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=315&w=601&s=00b77963f23288a766f14277c1f81b67d803ecbe13f8c1c97b4df77c58996213&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Gary Starkweather in the early 1970s with a version of the laser printer.

Music,The Father-Daughter Bond at the Heart of Opera's Greatest Epic,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/arts/music/met-opera-wagner-ring-walkure-lepage.html,"A poignant scene between Wotan (here James Morris) and Brunnhilde (Irene Theorin) in Otto Schenk's old Metropolitan Opera production of Wagner's ""Ring"" could not be simpler.

We tend to think about Wagner's ""Ring"" as an epic saga of bitter rivalries, fearless heroes and flying horses. But at the core of ""Die Walkure,"" the second of the four ""Ring"" operas, is something far more intimate: one of the most profound depictions of a father-daughter relationship in all the arts. The complex feelings between the brooding god Wotan and his favorite daughter, the feisty Valkyrie warrior Brunnhilde, come to a head during an intimate scene in Act II, when, in a rare moment of vulnerability, Wotan confesses what a mess he's made of things. [Read about the triumph of Christine Goerke, the Met's Brunnhilde.] The director Robert Lepage bungles this poignant scene in his production for the Metropolitan Opera, which returns on Monday. His staging makes me realize what I still miss about Otto Schenk's production, which the Met retired 10 years ago. Mr. Schenk's traditional approach, which presents the ""Ring"" as a storybook tale of gods, giants and dwarfs, had its limitations. But he was keenly sensitive to the relationships between Wagner's characters, and his staging of this confessional moment is a high point. Long known as Wotan's Narrative, this scene can seem like a dead spot: nearly 20 minutes of talk, talk, talk. In fact, it's the heart of the entire cycle.

In the Schenk ""Walkure"" -- available on DVD and the Met Opera On Demand, conducted by James Levine and starring James Morris as Wotan and Hildegard Behrens as Brunnhilde -- Wotan seems at first to be speaking to himself. Brunnhilde, who has never seen her father like this, warily approaches to ask what's wrong. This anguished Wotan hesitates. If he voices his thoughts out loud, he says, will he lose grip on his own will? Brunnhilde tenderly replies that when he talks to her, he is ""speaking to his will."" So he opens up, admitting to his greed for power; to violating the treaties he had pledged to uphold; to confiscating a magic ring from the Nibelung dwarf Alberich.

It's clear from the staging that what's really transfixing Brunnhilde -- more than the tangled story Wotan tells -- is the fact that her father is opening up at all. Suddenly, this goddess seems like any devoted daughter of a powerful, emotionally walled-off father, finally confessing everything. And to her! The narrative comes to a crucial turn when Wotan explains how his hunger for knowledge drove him to follow the earth goddess Erda to her realm -- where, in time, he says, the world's ""wisest woman"" gave birth ""to you, Brunnhilde."" In Mr. Schenk's staging, Mr. Morris's Wotan melts with fatherly affection and cradles her face in his hands, as Behrens's Brunnhilde, with radiant eyes and a wistful smile, basks in her father's love. How does Mr. Lepage present this scene?

It starts off promisingly. In the version also available on video, and also conducted by Mr. Levine, a visibly rattled Wotan (Bryn Terfel) frets that he is the least free of all men. Brunnhilde (Deborah Voigt) looks both concerned and scared. But as the narrative begins, this Wotan walks up the raked planks of the production's massive set and assumes a lordly stance, looking past Brunnhilde, who stands meekly below. So father and daughter are kept apart during what is supposed to be their moment of closest bonding.

Suddenly, a circle of light rises from the ground in front of Brunnhilde. The image morphs into a huge eye. Brunnhilde, now sitting on the ground, begins to watch what is, in effect, a greatest-hits animated video projection of the story Wotan relates. When he talks of the giants who built the castle Valhalla, we see circles of color to suggest its rainbow bridge. When he speaks of Erda, a ghostly image of her comes into view. And when Wotan says that Erda conceived a child, this Brunnhilde is shown what looks like a sonogram image of her embryonic self. Rather than basking in her father's love, Ms. Voigt's Brunnhilde, looking nervous and confused, turns her face away from him. The overly obvious animated images are bad enough. What's worse is that, by fixating with such preposterous exactitude on the details of Wotan's story, Mr. Lepage distracts us from caring about what Wagner is really depicting: a proud but failing father who, with no one else he can trust, confides in his daughter. With Mr. Schenk's staging, a newcomer to ""Die Walkure"" watching this father-daughter moment from a balcony seat at the Met may well have found it ponderous: two singers, sitting on a rock, during a long stretch of very slow music. But consummate artists like Behrens and Mr. Morris, working with a skilled director, trusted, rightly, that this restraint and subtlety would lend emotional richness and honesty to the scene. And emotional richness is just what Mr. Lepage's production too often lacks.","At the core of the ""Ring"" is the relationship between Wotan and Brünnhilde.

Global Business,"Central Bank Props Up Spain and Italy, for Now",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/business/global/insiders-see-no-limits-to-european-central-banks-arsenal-in-debt-crisis-fight.html,"FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank has succeeded at least temporarily in pushing down the effective interest rates on Spanish and Italian government debt. But analysts say the bank must still convince investors that it has the stamina to withstand what could be a long struggle against market turmoil. Spanish and Italian bond prices rose and their yields fell on Tuesday after the central bank stepped in for a second day to buy their sovereign debt, part of expanded efforts to prevent the European debt crisis from deepening in two of the largest economies in the euro currency zone. The central bank's move, much more ambitious than its previous forays into the bond market, has set off a debate about how far the bank legally can go under its charter. According to bank insiders and analysts, the answer seems to be: as far as it wants. But the bigger questions may be how much intervention the central bank's balance sheet can sustain -- and how much help it will get from European governments. The pan-European bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, is politically loaded and months away from having new money brought to a vote by member nations in the euro area.

In late trading Tuesday, the yield on Spain's benchmark 10-year government bonds was down an additional 0.1 percentage point, at 5.019 percent. It had reached a record high of 6.458 percent on Aug. 2. The yield on 10-year Italian bonds, meanwhile, fell Tuesday to a one-month low of 5.143 percent. To keep Spanish and Italian bond yields at sustainable levels over the long term will be a huge challenge for the European Central Bank, as investors test the bank's resolve. ""Once they have started buying it will be difficult to stop buying,"" said Jacques Cailloux, chief European economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland. As it has when buying Greek bonds in the past, analysts say, the central bank will probably portray its interventions as a means to maintain control over interest rates and hold down inflation -- not as a rescue of any particular country, which is forbidden by treaty. And analysts expect the bank to make a show of taking as much money out of circulation as it spends buying bonds, to avoid the appearance the central bank is printing money or flooding the economy with cash through so-called quantitative easing of the sort the United States Federal Reserve has resorted to in recent years.

On Tuesday in Washington, the Federal Reserve stopped well short of such a move, instead indicating it would keep rates low through mid-2013. But it said it might again resort to quantitative easing, if economic conditions did not improve. The European Central Bank, too, is loath to acknowledge any limitations on its monetary policy arsenal. And, in the worst case, it might even engage in quantitative easing if it saw signs of deflation. ""We do what we judge necessary to be sure that we deliver price stability,"" Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the central bank, said last week, repeating a phrase he has used often.

Confronted by a fundamental threat to the euro or to Europe's banking system, the central bank might have no choice but to take further action. ""They will do whatever it takes because they will be forced to,"" Mr. Cailloux said. ""There are no technical impediments to buying unlimited amounts"" of bonds, he added. But that might require effectively printing money. Previously the central bank has intervened only in the much smaller markets for Greek, Portuguese and Irish bonds, spending 74 billion euros ($105 billion).

Some analysts say the bank may need to spend more than 10 times that to maintain control over yields on Spanish and Italian debt. If so, it might have trouble fully offsetting the purchases by paying banks interest to park money at the central bank, as it has done so far. The bank's purchases of Spanish and Italian bonds on Monday and Tuesday, reported by traders but not officially confirmed by the central bank, came amid broader market turmoil after Standard & Poor's downgrading of American debt late Friday. The central bank felt forced to respond because last week the cost of borrowing for both Spain and Italy soared to record highs, with yields on their 10-year bonds topping 6 percent -- a level that could raise the countries' interest payments to ruinous levels and threaten to undermine the entire euro union. And despite the bank's efforts, there were growing signs on Tuesday of heightened tensions in the banking system. Money market indicators showed that European banks' reluctance to lend to one another was approaching levels not seen since the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008. The central bank has acknowledged these tensions. Last week it expanded the low-cost loans it offers to banks to ensure they have enough cash to conduct operations. Mr. Trichet said last week that he wanted European governments to take over the bond buying, as they had agreed to do through the stability fund. But the fund may not have enough money to intervene successfully in the huge Italian and Spanish bond markets, and it is not clear that all 17 euro area members will provide the necessary authority. Mr. Trichet also insisted that European governments do more to reduce debt and remove regulations and bureaucracy that impede growth, particularly in countries like Italy and Greece. ""The governments have to do their job,"" Mr. Trichet said at a news conference last week. ""This is absolutely fundamental."" Uri Dadush, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, argues, as do several other economists, that the financial crisis is becoming too big for any one central bank or government to manage and that they must coordinate their efforts. There are signs that leaders are poised to act if necessary.","After succeeding in pushing down the interest rates on Spanish and Italian government debt, the European Central Bank still needs to convince investors that it has the stamina to withstand turmoil.",6218f585-bb34-5d48-90d3-8bec9a1ad7f5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/08/10/business/ECB/ECB-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=335&w=600&s=c5e727572b0799f88c8dc91f869d11f56e7b7246e328f4aa6112ef100fe64715&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"""We do what we judge necessary to be sure that we deliver price stability,"" Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, said last week, repeating a phrase he has used often.",6218f585-bb34-5d48-90d3-8bec9a1ad7f5,N24News/imgs/6218f585-bb34-5d48-90d3-8bec9a1ad7f5.jpg,24
Fashion & Style,"Hair Salons Reopen, and Americans Rush Back",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/fashion/haircut-salon-reopening.html,"Few professional encounters require prolonged bouts of close contact like appointments at hair or beauty salons. This makes beauty, nail and barbershops potentially high-risk hubs of infection for the coronavirus, which has killed almost half a million people worldwide since the start of this year. And yet, across the United States, customers are clamoring to fix gray roots, shaggy beards and chipped nails in reopened salons after months in lockdown, despite stark changes to how these services can now be offered. How do you cut hair behind someone's ears when they're also wearing a mask? Doesn't matter, people are doing it. According to data from Safegraph, a data firm that determines which businesses people visit by tracking aggregated and anonymized cellphone data, foot traffic to hair and beauty salons and barbershops dropped nationwide by 60 percent mid-April. But by the start of June, as some states started to lift stay-at-home orders, traffic to those salons was just 30 percent lower than a year ago. (Safegraph and other companies that collect mobile phone locations have been criticized over privacy concerns, as location data is often sold to advertisers, retail outlets and even hedge funds seeking insights into consumer behavior.)

The data can't fully capture where all Americans are going. Safegraph monitors foot traffic data by tracking GPS pings from cellphones inside generated building shapes that have been created with North American Industry Classification System codes. (This is the standard used by federal statistical agencies to classify businesses for collecting and analyzing data related to the nation's business economy.) But people who don't carry phones or who disallow tracking are not counted in these data sets. And, there's no way to measure who is getting haircuts on the sly, or in a location that isn't officially classed as a salon. Anecdotal reports of such activity are very high. In some states, including Nevada (for hair salons) and Montana and Mississippi (for nail bars), foot traffic is already back to levels recorded this time last year.

According to figures from the research firm Nielsen, hair dyeing products sold online more than doubled, from $50 million to $128 million in sales, in the United States in the 12 weeks since the start of March, as compared to the same period last year. Hair styling items increased by 20 percent and sales of men's hair clippers (in physical stores) jumped 53 percent. By contrast, clothing sales both in stores and online have fallen by 89 percent since February, the Commerce Department said in May. Perhaps our collective desire for a haircut or nice nails isn't so surprising. For many segments of society, beauty services are central to a sense of identity. And heading back to salons after a collective social trauma could be one way to recover some normalcy. But it is still a psychological puzzle: Why are we willing to risk illness and death for something seemingly superficial? In most states, hair salons and beauty parlors reopened earlier than other businesses that were deemed nonessential. But tattoo parlors and tanning salons, which also fall in the same ""personal care services"" category, have not seen similar levels of returning foot traffic. (Pet grooming services, on the other hand, have seen high levels of foot traffic, in part because in some states the service was deemed an essential business.)

Many hair and beauty salons have elected to stay shut, even in reopened places. Workers say they are nervous about balancing their own health and safety with earning a living, especially because many work on a freelance or contract basis. And, most state regulations call for salon workers to use personal protective equipment (P.P.E.), which some stylists argue should be reserved for medical workers while there are still ongoing national shortages. ""It is scary. I don't want to get sick,"" said Noreen Suchodolski, 30, a hair stylist from Philadelphia who was laid off in March. Every week she takes part in a Zoom call with almost 40 other freelance stylists who used to work at the Norman Dee salon, where they talk about how to make the workplace safe when it reopens. ""I don't want to go back to work until it is completely safe,"" Ms. Suchodolski said. ""But at the same time I have now been out of work for almost three months."" Salons have reopened their doors around the world, including across Europe and in Southeast Asia. Denmark lifted restrictions in mid-April and Switzerland followed suit two weeks later, with Germany and then Spain in May. (In Britain, professional beautification will have to wait until July 4 at the earliest.) As in the United States, European governments say grooming business can resume services only under strict conditions, with fines of hundreds of euros for those who violate them.

""I'm still here, I'm standing for your rights and Salon a La Mode is open for business,"" she said in a Facebook Live filmed after she was released from jail, prompting the Texas senator Ted Cruz, a Republican, to pop in for a trim. (Both Mr. Cruz and the hair stylist wore masks.) Ms. Luther maintained that her clients should be entitled to make their own choices, and that employees had the right to earn money for their families. Others -- similarly minded but less inclined to break the law -- have hired ""bootlegger beauticians,"" or beauty therapists who make clandestine visits to clients' houses during lockdown. In some parts of the United States, people have driven hundreds of miles over state lines for a spray tan or roots fix. In Italy, a group of mayors posted videos on social media chastising citizens for visiting salons in secret. Some hair stylists and beauticians who have been unable to work say they are getting increasingly desperate. Many are self-employed or freelance workers who are on unpaid leave from salons. For owners, sustaining a business without revenue isn't the only financial undertaking they face now; before reopening, they must invest in masks, gloves and social distancing measures for themselves and their clients. In a recent survey of more than 2,500 salons by the Chicago-based hair industry resource Behind the Chair, 14.5 percent of owners said they had enough savings to sustain their businesses through three months without revenue. But about one-third said they could survive only one month. Nearly half said they had no emergency fund at all. Only a handful of reported cases of Covid-19 have been tied to hair and nail salons thus far, with proprietors attributing this to high adherence levels to sanitation protocols. This includes a cluster outbreak in Hong Kong in May and the first person to contract the coronavirus through community spread in California.

It's a time of intense loneliness in the Western world. According to a 2018 AARP Foundation survey, roughly one-third of older adults in the United States are socially isolated, a state that is linked to increased health risks, including heart disease, cancer, depression, diabetes and suicide. A routine manicure or blow dry is often a rare moment of intimacy and human touch on which people had come to rely. According to the psychotherapist Susie Orbach, a major motivation for salon visits is the stronger sense of their bodies and identities people can get through grooming. ""Many people, particularly women, are so accustomed to thinking about how we represent ourselves publicly that it then becomes structured into our own sense of self,"" Ms. Orbach said. ""That can be very jarring to lose, even when we are stuck at home with nobody to see us.""","Many beauty salons and barbershops are booked solid with appointments, showing how much grooming is a treasured ritual.",839a4e37-0105-52ca-849c-173b63ed2d5a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/14/fashion/12VIRUS-HAIRSALONS-california/12VIRUS-HAIRSALONS-california-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a749fec48e49687f5b54887c897aea2448021bba92edeabc2070c15c22e1408c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Tisha Fernhoff works with a client at the Beauty Bar Salon in Auburn, Calif., on April 29.",839a4e37-0105-52ca-849c-173b63ed2d5a,N24News/imgs/839a4e37-0105-52ca-849c-173b63ed2d5a.jpg,19
Technology,"Facebook Bans Anti-Vaccination Ads, Clamping Down Again",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/technology/facebook-bans-anti-vaccination-ads.html,"Facebook on Tuesday said it would no longer allow anti-vaccination ads on its platform, in another reversal of its longtime stance of avoiding being the referee on thorny issues.

Facebook had previously shied away from stepping into debates over public health, even as anti-vaccination content on its site proliferated. But this year, it took a stand against false information related to the coronavirus to prevent public harm. It also has removed vaccine-related hoaxes that were identified by global health organizations.

In its updated policy on Tuesday, Facebook went further. The company said it would no longer permit people or entities to purchase ads that actively discourage people from getting vaccinated, or that portray vaccines as unsafe, useless or use other harmful descriptions.

Sports,First Career Goal Gives Islanders an Overtime Win,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/sports/islanders-blackhawks.html,"The Blackhawks took the lead just 3:05 into the first, when Kahun swooped just outside the crease and backhanded home a rebound of a shot by Brandon Saad.

Barzal didn't need long to tie the game with the first of his two goals. Johnny Boychuk's shot from the blue line was deflected by Delia and bounced off the stick of the Islanders' Anthony Beauvillier to Barzal, who swung at the puck while it was a few inches off the ice. The puck sailed past Blackhawks defenseman Erik Gustafsson and over the stick arm of Delia at the 6:47 mark.

The Islanders briefly appeared to take the lead with 6:20 left in the second, when Cal Clutterbuck batted home a rebound in the crease. But upon replay, the goal was waved off because Clutterbuck's stick was above the crossbar.

Barzal put the Islanders ahead in similar fashion with 1:04 left in the second, when he was stationed next to Delia as Nick Leddy's shot was initially turned back by the Blackhawks goalie. Barzal then tucked the puck into the corner of the net past a sprawling Delia.

Kane tied the game in unusual fashion 5:01 into the third, when his stick broke as he fired a shot from the face-off circle. However, Kane put enough on the shot that it fluttered into the crease and skipped past Lehner.","Devon Toews, playing in his fifth N.H.L. game, gave the Islanders their fifth consecutive win.",51598a66-d365-5808-84c2-4679e6fbd154,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/04/sports/04nhl-1/merlin_148729986_171d9b90-ab28-4b3e-a301-32367c7b2253-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=ecbcc3062d8cd7cb03e4d80161817e19ad3af9ac6df3df878d9234127e239e1d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Islanders defenseman Devon Toews scored less than two minutes into overtime Thursday night, to the dismay of Chicago Blackhawks goaltender Collin Delia.",51598a66-d365-5808-84c2-4679e6fbd154,N24News/imgs/51598a66-d365-5808-84c2-4679e6fbd154.jpg,9
Theater,Political Plays for Political Times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/theater/hansard-a-very-expensive-poison.html,"LONDON -- If you're going to crib from one of the greats, it helps to have great actors at your command. ""Hansard,"" at the National Theater through Nov. 25, is the debut play from the actor Simon Woods, perhaps best known for the TV series ""Cranford."" But even as the writing makes plain a slavish debt to Edward Albee, this two-hander is kept aloft by a pair of performers, Lindsay Duncan and Alex Jennings, able to make its overfamiliar contours seem fresh.

The 85-minute play (no intermission) could as easily be titled ""Who's Afraid of Margaret Thatcher?"" That's because ""Hansard,"" centering on the jibes and ripostes of a married couple, specifically recalls Albee's ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" -- including its unseen if much discussed son -- but set in the world of British politics in the 1980s.

One thing this husband and wife are bickering about is Section 28, a 1988 law that prohibited the local authorities from ""promoting homosexuality."" (It was eventually repealed in 2003.) But Diana Hesketh (Ms. Duncan), an eloquent left-winger, finds much else about which to square off against her husband, Robin (Mr. Jennings), a Conservative member of Parliament whose background sounds an awful lot like that of the current prime minister, Boris Johnson. That affinity allows ""Hansard"" to elide past and present: A wisecrack about ""European foxes"" wreaking havoc on Diana's adored garden winks at Brexit-era realpolitik.

There are jokes about Mrs. Thatcher going to the theater (an activity she was known to dislike) , as well as a remarkably tasteless jab at a onetime Conservative party grandee and his wife, who was paralyzed by an IRA bombing. But most of the play consists of the two actors, both Olivier Award winners, watchfully maneuvering across the wide expanse of Hildegard Bechtler's airy yet arid set, quoting Shakespeare at each other or joining forces to make a mean-looking bloody mary. Diana, especially, appears to know her way around the drinks cabinet.","From a member of Parliament in ""Hansard"" to the users of a threatened community center in ""Faith, Hope and Charity,"" London theaters are exploring how power works.",8b572716-81e7-594c-8750-38bd468fe7a6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/25/arts/25londontheater01/25londontheater01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=ea78fa26669594f14132d5cc198daea646b59d4c85b72253f6aa61338a905502&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Alex Jennings and Lindsay Duncan in ""Hansard,"" by Simon Woods, at the National Theater.",8b572716-81e7-594c-8750-38bd468fe7a6,N24News/imgs/8b572716-81e7-594c-8750-38bd468fe7a6.jpg,10

Design with a difference: Details from the exhibition ""Access+Ability"" at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.

How Design for One Turns Into Design for All

Matthew Walzer was a college-bound teenager with cerebral palsy when he sent a letter to Nike several years ago. He explained that he had trouble tying laces and slipping into shoes without help. But he didn't want sneakers that looked clunky and clinical. He wanted Nikes, stylish ones like other students wore that worked for him. In response, the company introduced a line called FlyEase. They're slip-ons with a zipper that seals the back and then Velcro-ties the top in one simple motion. Not incidentally, they look fantastic. A pair is now on view at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in ""Access+Ability,"" a show organized by Cara McCarty and Rochelle Steiner.

Nearly a century ago, tubular metal furniture by Marcel Breuer helped reinvent the wheelchair. Chairs by Charles and Ray Eames, classics of midcentury modernism, evolved from a molded plywood splint the couple devised for wounded soldiers. But too often products made for people with different physical, cognitive and sensory abilities have been ugly, feebly designed and stigmatizing. They've been developed not by designers but by engineers. And engineers haven't always taken their cues from people who have disabilities, the ones who know best what they need and want.

Graham Pullin is one of the designers of a prosthesis in the show, called Hands of X. I called him the other day. He cited the example of eyeglasses, which doctors used to call ""medical appliances."" Then fashion designers got involved. Annual global sales of eyewear now approach $100 billion. You can imagine if hearing aids were given the same treatment. They might end up looking like the Bedazzled and Bejeweled Earring Aid, by Elana Langer, in ""Access+Ability"":

It turns out that one out of five adults in the United States has some disability, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- one out of 20 children. That's a demographic and economic motivator. But we also know that when people feel better about themselves, medical outcomes improve. ""The utility of the most functional object in the world will go to waste if potential users don't connect with it and can't see themselves using it,"" said Donald Strum, a principal for product and graphic design at Michael Graves Architecture and Design. Graves's firm has rethought, among many medical devices, walking sticks, so they work better and use interchangeable handles, colors and tips, which let customers personalize them.

Mr. Strum told me he approached Target about producing a line of medical equipment a decade ago. The company declined. Back then, its marketing department didn't find the idea sexy. If other retailers took the lead, company officials said, they might follow. Well, the climate has clearly changed. Target now offers adaptive clothing. There's a Target puffer jacket in the show, designed by Mari Anderson Bogdan, with Velcro seams and zip-on sleeves to serve young people who have trouble dressing. Zappos has gotten into the game, too, selling reversible shirts, coats, dresses and pants, in response to parents who petitioned the online retailer to offer shoes and clothes, easy on and off, for children with disabilities.

And now Tommy Hilfiger has its own line of pants, shirts, jackets, sweaters and dresses, using magnetic closures instead of buttons and snaps. Hilfiger has teamed up with MagnaReady, a company started a few years ago by Maura Horton, then a former clothing designer, whose husband suffered from Parkinson's disease. He had trouble buttoning his shirt. Ms. Horton saw an opportunity, not an obstacle. As with other products in the show, the impetus for better design came from the ground up, in this case not from someone with the disability but from a family member.

They provide a good example of how design alters the social and business calculus. Compression socks help increase the circulation of blood and minimize swelling from prolonged sedentariness. They're often worn by people with diabetes or high blood pressure. You may picture them in tan, black or white, next to the bunion pads at the drugstore. But, as it happens, fashion models wear compression socks, too, because they spend long stretches of time on airplanes. So do athletes. And what models and athletes wear moves a lot of merchandise. Compression socks in stylish patterns are just stylish socks that happen to have a medical value for some customers. Any fashion-conscious consumer with a little cash to spare might consider them. When I got home from the show, I Googled a picture of the Nike FlyEase for my teenage son but didn't tell him the back story. He loved they way they looked.

And that's not unlike the thinking behind plastic prosthetic leg covers by McCauley Wanner and Ryan Palibroda, two young Canadian designers, who founded Alleles Design Studio. The covers are among the most striking things in the show: intricately patterned, beautifully designed, like snap-on tattoos. ""Our stuff is not cheap,"" Mr. Palibroda acknowledged, ""but we're the cheapest prosthetic cover company by far, and we get daily pushback from the industry. Distributors and clinicians are constantly telling us to quadruple our prices."" Ms. Wanner said that keeping the covers relatively affordable is partly about changing the public conversation: ""We want an 18-year-old girl to be able to afford our cover and feel fabulous. Part of the annoyance of being an amputee is that in public people are always seeing prostheses and asking the amputees to explain what happened, so they're constantly made to relive trauma. Our desire is that people see these covers and say, 'cool legs,' like 'cool boots.'"" Nobody wants pity, Ms. Wanner added: ""We all want the same thing. We all want to feel amazing.""","Historically, products made for people with different physical, cognitive and sensory abilities have been ugly and woefully designed.

Well,Why Doctors Still Worry About Measles,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/well/family/why-doctors-still-worry-about-measles.html,"My grandmothers had measles. Your grandmothers had measles. In medicine, it is taken for granted that all people born before 1957 had measles, whether they remember it or not. Grandmothers invariably were invoked on questions of measles back when I was doing my residency in the 1980s in Boston. When there was a child in the emergency room with a truly striking and scary rash, a senior attending physician would stride in, look at the child, and announce something like, ""Your grandmother could diagnose measles from across the room!"" Nowadays, pediatricians worry that we've lost our collective memory and therefore some of our healthy fear of the disease and its serious complications -- at least until an exposure happens and people start to panic.

Indeed, measles is a disease with a very specific character, and it still infects and kills children across the world. And a study presented in October suggested that one of the most feared later complications of measles is actually more common than we knew, and while it's still rare, it reminds us of the urgency of protecting young children. Researchers reviewed all the cases in California from 1998 to 2016 of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a degenerative brain disease which occurs years after measles infection, but is still clearly linked to the virus and the body's reaction to it. They found that those children who had had measles at less than 12 months old had a much higher risk of developing this fatal complication than had previously been reported. ""To our surprise, it was higher than generally recognized,"" said Dr. James D. Cherry, one of the authors of the study, and a distinguished research professor in pediatric infectious diseases at the University of California, Los Angeles. We learned about SSPE in medical school as a serious but very rare development that occurred after 1 in 100,000 cases of measles. In the California study, they found 17 such cases, and then traced those that they could back to the measles cases reported during the relevant years, many of them in an outbreak in 1989-90. When they extrapolated out from the relationship between the cases of measles and the cases of SSPE, they found that for children under a year, the rate was 1 in 600. To doctors, that no longer seems like a rare event -- you would get one such case for every 600 young children who got measles. Though thanks to vaccines, in most years there are far fewer than 600 measles cases in the United States. This year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded only 62 as of Nov. 5.

But it is still something to worry about for a disease which, without vaccination, infects whole populations. The complications start an average of eight years after the infection. ""Nobody would connect it with measles,"" Dr. Cherry said. SSPE begins with symptoms like poor performance in school and subtle behavioral changes, Dr. Cherry said, and then progresses over the course of months to seizures. And then the children deteriorate further: ""They lose a lot of other functions, and then they end up needing tube feeding and in a vegetative state."" Measles also causes a form of encephalitis in some children right at the time of infection, and it can harm and kill children in other ways. Measles encephalitis is what killed Olivia, the 7-year-old daughter of the writer Roald Dahl, in 1962, before the vaccine was available; he wrote a passionate letter to other parents two decades later, imploring them to get their children immunized. Those children who do die from measles are often killed by other infections, especially pneumonia. Measles was ""the first immunosuppressive virus described, long before H.I.V.,"" said Dr. William J. Moss, the deputy director of the International Vaccine Access Center and a professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Epidemiologists have attributed any nontraumatic death in the first 30 days after measles to the disease, he said, but more recent evidence suggests that the risk period may be longer than that. The virus is so contagious because it can spread through airborne transmission, but also because the viral particles stay in the air or on surfaces for a long time. If you are not immunized (as children under a year are not) or if you only had one dose and you are in the 5 percent of people who don't respond to that first dose, you can get infected by being on the bus, or in the pediatrician's waiting room, even after the sick person has left. ""Two of the most contagious viral infections are smallpox and measles,"" said Dr. Anne Gershon, the director of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at Columbia. Before they develop that characteristic measles rash, children have high fever and respiratory symptoms, and they are therefore at their most infectious before the disease has been identified. ""In the early stages of the disease there's a lot of coughing, runny eyes and nose, but you don't think of isolating somebody till the rash comes out and after that they're gradually less contagious,"" she said.

Dr. Matt Zahn, the medical director for epidemiology for the Orange County Health Care Agency oversaw the public health response in Orange County to the Disneyland measles outbreak which began in December 2014. He also took care of kids who were sick in the hospital. ""The fever is high, there's a lot of nasal congestion and cough, these kids are miserable, they feel rotten,"" he said. ""A kid with measles is not a smiling child who has a mild rash."" The anti-vaccine movement has been known to cite sitcom episodes as evidence that measles wasn't a serious disease; sure, the Brady Bunch kids got red spots. In fact, the measles rash is quite startling, with red patches that tend to merge as they cover the skin. The first dose of measles vaccine, which we currently give at 12 months, leaves 95 percent of children immune, but that's not enough for effective herd immunity with a disease this contagious. That's the reason for the second dose of vaccine, which is now given at 4 years old, but may be moved up. We passed a kind of milestone last September when the Americas were declared officially free of endemic measles cases, an epidemiologic honor meaning that the only cases seen in this hemisphere since 2002 were from imported virus. But it's a fragile victory, as everyone who works with infectious diseases continues to worry, since the disease is still around in many other parts of the world, and people travel back and forth, and there is a significant population of unprotected young children in this country, largely thanks to parental anxiety about vaccination. Even more worrisome, according to some experts, is the population of children whose parents refused the vaccine a couple of decades ago; measles can be a bad disease in children, but it can be even more dangerous in young adults. Dr. Zahn said of the California outbreak: ""What contained this virus in this event was that while we have relatively lower immunization rates in some pediatric populations in our community, our adult immunization rates were high, well over 95 percent,"" Unvaccinated children might get sick, but the virus had no place to go in their families because the adult population had grown up in an era when everyone got vaccinated. If there's another outbreak some years down the line, we may have many more unvaccinated adults. ""It won't affect how you start the fire, but how long that fire burns in the community may be very different,"" he said.",A generation of parents no longer remembers the risks and potential for serious complications from the disease.,a68376c0-334e-55b1-9306-69d051bf5f3b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/12/science/Measles-Klassart/Measles-Klassart-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=258c61c1f89c2d3db937a05bf810bb7dc2c6019966803a676a49828e300935bf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"In this 1973 archive photo, doctors inoculate children to reduce the outbreak of measles in Passaic County, N.J.",a68376c0-334e-55b1-9306-69d051bf5f3b,N24News/imgs/a68376c0-334e-55b1-9306-69d051bf5f3b.jpg,18
Travel,"In Kolkata, a Love of Literature, Fried Street Food and, Mostly, Sweets",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/22/travel/budget-travel-kolkata-india.html,"India's rivers are central to the life of its people and the Hooghly River, a 160-mile branch of the Ganges that runs through the city of Kolkata in West Bengal, is no different. In the late afternoon, I walked to Babu Ghat, and onto the broad concrete slipway that descended into the water, where a few moored boats bobbed slowly and men and children bathed in underclothes. The sticky heat had finally begun to break and people were out sitting on the banks of the Hooghly, chatting, eating, or just watching the sun glitter on the water as it began its descent. A young man approached me and, apropos of nothing, asked if I liked Kolkata. When I replied yes, he nodded and said, ""Kolkata is the heart of India."" After four days in Kolkata (or the Anglicized ""Calcutta""), the capital of West Bengal and known by the nickname, City of Joy, it was difficult to argue. Kolkata, a city strongly associated with British rule and the East India Company, has a fascinating relationship with its colonial history. With a rich literary tradition and strong educational institutions, Kolkata also has a more relaxed and peaceful feel than some of India's other modern metropolises. Combined with spicy Bengali cuisine and a love of fried street food, it proved a rewarding place to explore -- and naturally, I managed to keep my budget in check. My comfortable room ($27 per night) in the Ballygunge area of the city was centrally located and ideal for exploring the rest of the city. I rented the room through Airbnb, which I use judiciously. When traveling solo, I'll typically rent a room in a family's home: In many instances, hosts have happily clued me in on things to see and do. One tip: Click on the host's profile picture to see how many properties they have listed. If I see that a host is managing a large number of places, I may choose to stay elsewhere -- I'm more interested in using Airbnb as a cultural exchange than as a hotel.

My hosts, Saroj and her daughter, Mrinalini, knew their city well and were happy to offer insight. They both loved the intellectual curiosity and open-mindedness of the city. ""Calcutta is laid back, old world, colonial. People have time; it's a little easier,"" said Mrinalini. ""In Bengali culture, women are generally considered equal,"" she added, compared to places like Delhi. ""In some cases they're actually considered superior: It's very progressive. I didn't even think about being feminist because I never needed to be."" Kolkata's colonial history is on display at the Victoria Memorial, a grand museum with attractive surrounding gardens that began construction in 1906 and opened to the public 15 years later (Tickets are 500 rupees, a little less than $7, for foreign visitors, and 30 rupees for locals). I made the 30-minute walk from my room in Ballygunge, dodging taxis and weaving between vendors selling fresh fruit and chaiwalas pouring searing hot tea into thin, earthen cups. (On the way there, I made a quick stop to appreciate the soaring Gothic Revival beauty of St. Paul's Cathedral, an Anglican house of worship completed in 1847.)

Within the Victoria Memorial's magnificent marble walls are some interesting artifacts and exhibitions. ""The Artist's Eye: India 1770-1835"" has a number of handsome paintings from the likes of Thomas Daniell and Tilly Kettle, who arrived in India in the 1760s and was one of the first prominent English painters to work in the country. On the other side of the exhibition hall, a more intriguing exhibit catalogs the timeline of British colonial rule in India through photos, prints and historical relics. Kolkata was made the capital of British India in 1772, but growing nationalist sentiment and resistance to British rule led to Britain moving the capital to Delhi in 1911. A devastating famine during World War II killed millions in Bengal -- some lay blame for the tragedy directly at the feet of the British. A caption under one of the last photos in the exhibition reads: ""Calcutta benefited from British rule more than other Indian cities, and also paid a greater price.""

I was mulling over those words when I struck up a conversation on the street with Aradhana Kumar Swami, a teacher who was picking up his wife and buying supplies in Kolkata before embarking on a 40-hour train journey home to the Kerala region. ""No, not at all,"" he responded, when I asked if there was any lingering resentment toward the British. ""We have no problem with the British."" Some people, he said, had an issue with the opulent Victoria Monument, however. Queen Victoria, he said, never once visited the city. ""That could have been a school or something,"" he said, and shook his head. It's easy to see where Kolkata's reputation as an educated city comes from: simply visit the College Street Book Market, near the University of Calcutta. I took the underground Metro to the Central station (5 rupees) and cut over to College Street. I immediately heard chanting, and came face-to-face with a large group of student protesters, waving signs and yelling slogans. I asked a couple of people what the protest was about -- they said it was government-related but wouldn't be more specific. Books, from markets and shops and roadside stalls The energy from the protest carried over to the book market, probably the largest collection of books I've ever seen in one place. Piles of books of all kinds -- from engineering to Shakespeare to Dan Brown -- spilled over from roadside stalls onto the street. I saw one barefoot vendor precariously negotiating his wares as if he were a mountain climber, looking for a particularly hard-to-find volume. I wanted something by the Nobel Prize winner and Kolkata native Rabindranath Tagore, and after asking around, I found a book of his short stories at a shop called Bani Library for just 95 rupees. I took my book around the corner to the College Street Coffee House, a favorite hangout for students, writers and intellectuals for the past 75 years. The place has an immediate shabby charm -- waiters dressed in green uniforms with gold belts navigate the cavernous, dimly lit room full of tables packed with people having animated discussions. I shared a table with a young couple and enjoyed a coffee with a plate of chicken chow mein noodles (100 rupees).

Security is tight at the temple -- no photos are allowed, and you'll have to check your cellphone, too (3 rupees), as well as your shoes (2 rupees). I joined a long queue of worshipers carrying gifts of money and flowers and got a peek at the Sri Sri Jagadiswari Kalimata Thakurani idol, bright red tongue visible and a foot placed onto a man's chest. I asked a stranger if he could tell me more about the significance of the idol, and he simply replied, ""Mother!"" The Mother House of the Missionaries of Charity, or just the Mother House, is another essential place to visit. Mother Teresa, the Roman Catholic nun and founder of the Missionaries of Charity who was canonized in 2016, worked and lived primarily at the Mother House from 1953 until her death in 1997. On the ground floor, a simple but elegant tomb marks Mother Teresa's final resting place, and all are welcome to pay their respects. The flavors and spices of Indian street food I spent hours walking the streets of Kolkata, and found this to be the best way to get to know the city. I worked up a decent appetite, naturally, and fortunately found a number of good options right there on the street. A deep love of Chinese cuisine pervades the city, as is evidenced by the number of stalls selling 30-rupee plates of fried chow mein noodles. I walked up and down Circus Avenue near my lodgings and indulged in another favorite, crunchy fried pakora made from chickpea flour (20 rupees) and sprinkled with spicy salt. Generous 10-rupee cups of spicy, milky tea are nearly omnipresent. The area around the Hatibagan Market, several blocks of sprawling chaos containing seemingly anything you could possibly want to buy, is another prime area to seek out street food. Navigating beeping cars and buses, gleaming displays of wristwatches and knockoff Tommy Hilfiger shirts, I found a sweet, earthy cup of freshly-squeezed sugar cane juice (30 rupees for a large cup). Down the street, I indulged in aloo chop, a deep-fried latke-like treat made from shredded potato and held together with chickpea flour (20 rupees for four pieces).","This city is more relaxed than some of its modern Indian counterparts, and residents claim a strong relationship to its colonial past.",2f555a2b-e5ad-53c5-9a17-bc7808a03a31,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/25/travel/25Frugal-Kolkata/25Frugal-Kolkata-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=7125247ce7509f9c1b7c85e5246ca5a7c67f6a2d3c9071d1ac4cb1203fdbf8e2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Boats moored along the Hooghly River, which runs through Kolkata.",2f555a2b-e5ad-53c5-9a17-bc7808a03a31,N24News/imgs/2f555a2b-e5ad-53c5-9a17-bc7808a03a31.jpg,4
Health,"Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann, Guide of the Gates Foundation",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/health/dr-susan-desmond-hellmann-guide-of-the-gates-foundation.html,"On her second anniversary as chief executive of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a global colossus of philanthropy, Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann wrote an open letter about progress against smoking in the Philippines, polio across the world and sleeping sickness in Africa. Before joining the foundation, she led development of the cancer drugs Avastin and Herceptin at Genentech, then was chancellor of the University of California, San Francisco. We spoke for an hour at her office in Seattle. A condensed and edited version of the conversation follows. What are some of the coolest, most surprising things the foundation is doing? What I think the foundation ought to be known for is making sure we do things that others can't or won't. So I wrote about the tobacco work for a couple reasons. One, people probably didn't know we did tobacco-control work. I'm an oncologist, so I know that tobacco is the cause of death for six million people. What did you do in the Philippines? They increased the tobacco tax. So we can pay, and did pay, for a group that can supply them with legal aid. If you're a relatively small government and Big Tobacco, you might call it, has a legal staff that can challenge your use of a tax or a policy, you could access excellent legal advice.

Tell us a little bit about how you're trying to figure out what's killing millions of kids before their fifth birthday. If you look at what's happened 1990 to 2015, vast improvement. But we want to decrease by half again that under-5 mortality by 2030. About 40 percent of those deaths now are in the first 30 days of life, most coming actually on your birthday, your first day. So here's a good news story. We know where pregnant women have H.I.V. in sub-Saharan Africa, so we can do extremely effective, nearly universally effective ARVs [antiretrovirals] for pregnant women. Using that precision public health, we decreased H.I.V. transmission from mother to child in sub-Saharan Africa by nearly half in five years. So we're doing surveillance. What we're doing actually is minimally invasive tissue sampling. So the way that we used to do it -- and we still do it --- is actually reasonably effective but excruciatingly difficult. A baby dies and you go to Mom, and it might be weeks after the death, and you say, ""Did the baby have a fever, were they holding their stomach, did they vomit?"" A verbal autopsy, it's called. What we're doing is adding minimally invasive tissue sampling: liver, lung. Are mothers receptive or horrified that you're suggesting this? These families have lost a child. And to my delight, the principal investigator said that one of the things that people felt is this helps with closure. With the departure of the U.S. military on Aug. 30, Afghanistan quickly fell back under control of the Taliban. Across the country, there is widespread anxiety about the future.

* Far From Home: Some Afghans who were abroad when the country collapsed are desperate to return, but have no clear route home.
* Can Afghan Art Survive? The Taliban have not banned art outright. But many artists have fled, fearing for their work and their lives.
* A Growing Threat: A local affiliate of the Islamic State group is upending security and putting the Taliban government in a precarious position. How will you use the information? Most importantly, we can start to see here's what we believe about epidemiology of H.I.V., TB, malaria, all of the things that we think are going on, and here's actually truth. I want the minister of health to say here's why babies die in this community, in my country. What do I have in my tool kit? What are the kinds of medicines I want my government to buy? Bill Gates and the foundation have joined the fight against polio. Do you think this is going to be the year that it ends?

Opinion,'Environmental Justice Is Not Merely a Box to Be Checked',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/opinion/virginia-pipeline.html,"When concerns about a pipeline were dismissed by regulators, a rural black enclave went to court -- and won.

In the years following the Civil War, freedmen and freedwomen founded a community close to the Virginia plantations where they had been enslaved. The settlers of Union Hill in Buckingham County, Va., passed down this land over generations to today's descendants, who are now at the center of a fight to stop a proposed multibillion dollar energy project. While Union Hill may represent the remarkable history of resilience from our country's unjust beginnings, it also reveals the country's continuing imbalance of power and the decisions about whose histories we choose to honor. Five years ago, Dominion Energy, Virginia's biggest investor-owned electric utility, announced plans to build a natural gas-fired compressor station in Union Hill for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The roughly $7.5-billion, 600-mile pipeline is being built by a consortium of four energy companies, with Dominion responsible for its construction and operation, and would run through West Virginia, Virginia and North Carolina. These stations, which compress natural gas so it can flow through pipelines, release toxic emissions such as methane, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter into the air, increasing the health risks for residents who live nearby. Many in Union Hill responded with fierce opposition but appeals to Dominion, state regulators and Virginia's governors went unheeded.

At a bare minimum, ensuring environmental justice in this case required Dominion and regulators to consider how economically disadvantaged or minority communities -- like Union Hill -- would be affected. Communities of color and people with fewer financial resources have often borne the brunt of pollution and other environmental burdens. Dominion and regulators should also have given serious consideration to an electric compressor that would nearly eliminate air pollution from the facility. They did neither. Instead of honoring Union Hill's past and present, the state's most powerful forces essentially denied its existence. The courts did not. In a win for our client Friends of Buckingham, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit this month threw out the permit for the compressor station, finding that the state failed to adequately consider the potential health effects on Union Hill's African-American community. As the court noted, ""Environmental justice is not merely a box to be checked."" This is the eighth permit for the pipeline project that has been vacated or suspended by federal courts or federal agencies, making the future of the project uncertain. Immediately following the appeals court ruling, Dominion said it would address the issues raised by the court and submit a revised permit application to state regulators. There's a revealing counterpart to this story. In 2018, Dominion proposed siting a similar compressor station on land it owned across the Potomac River from George Washington's Mount Vernon, home to over 300 enslaved persons at the time of Washington's death. The Mount Vernon estate launched a ""Save the View"" campaign that gained national attention, and shortly thereafter Dominion agreed to drop its proposal and look for alternative sites.

Mount Vernon tells the history of America, but so does Union Hill. Environmental justice is a commitment to right the wrongs of our past that persist today. It's no coincidence the environmental justice movement was born in the South, when in 1982 an African-American community in Warren County, N.C. failed to stop the siting of a landfill that would contain soil contaminated by PCBs, but birthed a powerful new movement. Union Hill shares its story with Warren County and countless other communities faced with the unjust burden of pollution, from Cancer Alley in Louisiana to Flint, Mich. and its lead-contaminated drinking water. This pattern of injustice, which often afflicts people of color and the poor, will become a more urgent problem as climate change threatens some Americans more than others. Union Hill would not be the only casualty of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The natural gas pipeline would cross steep mountain terrain through two national forests, a national scenic trail and parkway and an endangered species habitat. Homes and farms in its path have been seized through eminent domain. And it would lock Virginia into fossil fuels for decades at a critical moment for climate action, even though the demand for natural gas in the region is likely to fall as the costs of renewable energy and storage technologies continue to fall. Union Hill would be a devastating casualty, its legacy of enslaved Virginians sacrificed to the modern hub of influence and power in the Commonwealth, reminding us again that we have not righted our past. Union Hill is as important a marker of the history of Virginia and American as Jamestown, Mount Vernon, and the state's Civil War battlefields. While Union Hill may not have behind it the resources or political clout of some of Virginia's more prominent historical sites, it is entitled to the same reverence and respect. That did not happen in this case. As the unanimous decision by the three-judge appeals court panel found, state regulators ""failed"" in their ""statutory duty to determine the character and degree of injury to the health of the Union Hill residents, and the suitability"" of a gas-powered compressor in the community. How we treat the story and future of Union Hill, and other communities like it, will define our history.

Style,"Whatever It Is, It's Probably Not Hair Dye",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/style/rudy-giuliani-hair.html,"Whatever It Is, It's Probably Not Hair Dye

Rudolph W. Giuliani gave a news conference on Thursday in which, as he continued to cast doubt on the results of the presidential election, it appeared he was starting to melt. [Late-night hosts take a closer look at what went wrong with Rudy Giuliani's hair.] Speaking from the headquarters of the Republican National Committee in Washington, Mr. Giuliani grew increasingly agitated as he expanded on the debunked allegations of widespread voter fraud that he has pursued since the election was called for Joseph R. Biden Jr. earlier this month. About 40 minutes into his statement, his sweat began to drip in color. By the time Mr. Giuliani began to take questions from reporters, the dark rivulets of liquid streaking down his face had become impossible to ignore, even as he pleaded with those present not to make light of his claims, for which he has yet to present evidence.

Many online commenters assumed that Mr. Giuliani was the victim of a bad dye job that was now seeping out under the bright lights of television. But several Manhattan hairdressers said that what was dripping down the face of the president's lawyer was likely not hair dye.

""Hair dye doesn't drip like that, unless it's just been applied,"" said David Kholdorov of the Men's Lounge Barbershop and Spa, on Manhattan's Upper East Side. He explained that hair dye is typically mixed with peroxide during the dyeing process, and that once the solution oxidizes, the color adheres to the hair. No one would leave the solution in place in its raw form, he said, because the solution would irritate the scalp and could burn the hair or cause it to fall out.

""Sideburns are more gray than the rest of the head,"" he said. ""You can apply mascara to touch the gray side up a bit so it looks more natural."" He said that anyone wishing to avoid what happened to Mr. Giuliani should avoid hot weather, and wait for the makeup to dry completely. ""In the picture, it looks really heavy,"" Mr. Vergani said, referring to a photograph of Mr. Giuliani during the news conference. ""I'm sure they put too much product and that's why it started to bleed."" Not everyone agreed. Gene Sarcinello, a stylist and colorist at Takamichi Hair, said that the streaks could have been caused by hair dye. ""If it's not washed out properly, that's what's going to happen,"" he said, adding that the dye could be spray-on. ""Not knowing exactly what he has on his hair, it's hair-color related definitely."" ""In some of the pictures I'm seeing, it looks glossy,"" he said. ""Which looks like a product in his hair.""

Mr. Giuliani's hair has long been the subject of public discussion. When, in 2002, he abandoned what had been a signature comb-over, The Washington Post's fashion critic, Robin Givhan, commended the move. ""Giuliani's comb-over had reached mythic proportions as it was memorialized in comedy bits on virtually every television network and in countless caricatures,"" she wrote. ""One can only assume that its disappearance will send shock waves ricocheting from the studios of 'Saturday Night Live' to the corner barbershop."" Thursday's event was the latest in an unusual series of public appearances for Mr. Giuliani. On Nov. 7, he delivered remarks from the parking lot of Four Seasons Total Landscaping, a Philadelphia landscaping company close to a crematory and a pornography shop. Several weeks before the election he was compelled to deny he had done anything wrong after his appearance in Sacha Baron Cohen's ""Borat"" sequel. Mr. Giuliani, who has served as Mr. Trump's personal lawyer for several years, has been one of the president's closest allies in Mr. Trump's continued attempts to subvert the Electoral College process that delivered the presidency to Mr. Biden. Chris Krebs, the senior cybersecurity official who countered several of Mr. Trump's false claims about the election and was subsequently fired by the president, tweeted Thursday that Mr. Giuliani's conference was ""the most dangerous 1hr 45 minutes of television in American history. And possibly the craziest."" ""If you don't know what I'm talking about, you're lucky,"" Mr. Krebs added. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Mr. Giuliani had asked Mr. Trump's campaign to pay him $20,000 a day for his work overseeing the White House's legal effort to overturn the election results. (Mr. Giuliani denied the report.) Thus far, his legal team has suffered a string of defeats in court.

Science,Worker Ants: You Could Have Been Queens,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/science/ants-genes-queen.html,"The critical factor for determining which ants become queens or workers may be as simple as some extra insulin. In a study published Thursday in the journal Science, researchers showed that the genes behind insulin signaling appear to play a key role in distinguishing the ants' assignments. In some ant species, a queen can be substantially larger and live 20 times longer than a worker, even though they are genetically identical. A number of insect species, including ants, wasps and bees, have queens that are responsible for reproduction, while a far larger number of often-sterile workers forage for food. ""We were interested in where these differences come from, how they're regulated and how they evolved,"" said Daniel Kronauer, the paper's senior author and an evolutionary biologist at Rockefeller University in New York.

[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] By looking at which genes are activated in the brains of queens and workers of different ant species, Dr. Kronauer and his colleagues determined that a hormone called insulin-peptide 2, or ILP2, played the most important role. But other insulin-signaling and unrelated genes were also differently activated, Dr. Kronauer said. ""Insulin signaling -- and this ILP2 version of insulin -- seems to be at the core of these queen-worker differences,"" Dr. Kronauer said.

In one species, the clonal raider ant, Ooceraea biroi, the team added this hormone to worker ants and activated their ovaries. This suggests that an extra dose of insulin may make the difference between foraging for food like a worker or laying eggs like a queen. During development, the larvae that are destined to become queens eat more than the ones destined to become workers, which at least partially explains their higher levels of insulin-like peptides, Dr. Kronauer said.

The team also found that insulin levels drop in worker ants when they're exposed to ant larvae. A bit like people getting hungry when their insulin levels fall, these worker ants are driven to seek food when they are exposed to larvae -- which they then feed to their hungry young. ""From an evolutionary perspective, that's a pretty clever way to make an organism social,"" Dr. Kronauer said. Ant ancestors developed the queen-worker social structure because it provided an evolutionary advantage. The new study suggests that insulin signaling could have driven that evolution.

There are 14,000 species of ants, all of which are believed to share the same mechanism of differentiation between queens and workers. Wasps, bees and other insects are thought to have evolved along another pathway, so insulin signaling is unlikely to be the defining distinction for them, said Roberto Bonasio, a molecular biologist at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research. ""I think the question is, how does something so difficult seem to happen repeatedly in different branches of life?"" said Dr. Bonasio, whose lab studies how genes change in the brain as ants change behavior.

With this experiment, the researchers lend support to the theory that changes in insulin signaling is one of the ways this can come about, he said. In people, when we eat, insulin is released into the bloodstream, enabling cells to take in sugar and use it for energy. Problems with this insulin system lead to diabetes. In ants, these insulin-like peptides regulate a lot of activities including metabolism, longevity and reproduction, Dr. Bonasio said. There is more work to be done to confirm these findings and to figure out what other types of genes are at work, he said. Such genetic analysis is tricky, he added, and more than half of key genes identified in the study were involved in activities other than insulin signaling.",Whether an ant becomes a worker or colony royalty may depend on insulin metabolism.,ad2d9731-9663-5ee5-b50a-b2b378e8f864,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/07/science/26TB-ANTS/26TB-ANTS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=cb4a551246af2ac0878dcb46a3bb913bc44e785744f11f6fdeb13263b6053183&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Army ants with their much larger queen.,ad2d9731-9663-5ee5-b50a-b2b378e8f864,N24News/imgs/ad2d9731-9663-5ee5-b50a-b2b378e8f864.jpg,2
Your Money,"Protecting Andy Warhol From Flood, Fire and Quake",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/your-money/homeowners-insurance-art-yacht.html,"People commonly pay insurance companies to secure their property against loss or damage. But for the affluent, insurance companies sometimes take matters into their own hands. Believing that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, some insurers will send in specialists to prepare a home for disaster, for instance, while others will pay to move valuables out of harm's way. Jeremy Alters, a personal injury lawyer in Miami, found out how far his insurer would go to protect his art collection when Hurricane Irma hit Florida last week. As the storm was gathering force in the Caribbean, he started to get nervous because it appeared that the hurricane was headed directly toward his beachfront home in Golden Beach, Fla. So with help from family and friends, Mr. Alters began to move his collection -- which includes works by Jeff Koons, Keith Haring and Andy Warhol -- to the second floor, hoping to protect it from flooding caused by the storm surge he was anticipating.

In the end, the hurricane took a different path, but the wind ripped a hole in his roof and piled sand three feet high around his home. When Mr. Alters called his insurer to file a claim, the company sent an art preservationist and a team of art movers to his home. The collection had survived the hurricane, but the hot, humid conditions posed a danger. Had he called sooner, the company told him, it would have moved the art out -- at no charge -- before the hurricane hit. ""I forgot that they said they'd help with the art during a storm,"" he said. ""Now, I'm paying attention."" Insurance companies that cater to high-net-worth individuals -- like AIG Private Client Group, Chubb, Cincinnati Insurance and Pure Insurance -- operate at a level of service that would seem unfamiliar to people who have mass-market insurers. Property and casualty insurers often send tips to their policyholders ahead of potential natural disasters like wildfires in the west or hurricanes in the southeast, but insurers with affluent clients like to go a step further -- even if it means intervening to protect the property themselves.

Insurers entice their wealthy clients to safeguard their possessions through financial incentives -- like adjustments to deductibles and premiums for making homes and collections safer ahead of time -- but also by appealing to their love for what they have. A six-figure check to cover the loss of a beloved piece of art is cold comfort when the wall is bare. Still, if these insurers prefer using carrots over sticks, they also don't mind delivering the carrot right to the client's doorstep. ""One of the challenges we have is giving advice,"" said Ross Buchmueller, chief executive of Pure, which provides coverage for Mr. Alters. ""If I say, 'Before you go away, you should turn the water off in your house,' there are only so many people who are going to do that. You feel good about it, but you didn't change behavior."" So Pure and its competitors try to nudge their clients. For instance, Mr. Buchmueller said, one of the risks with older homes in earthquake-prone areas like California is that the gas line can be severed in a quake, risking a gas leak that can blow up the house. There are inexpensive seismic shut-off valves that are easy to install -- save for the lack of time or desire the homeowner may have to install it. Pure will address the situation for homeowners before it becomes a problem. ""Our guy shows up with the hardware,"" Mr. Buchmueller said. ""He'd schedule the appointment with the plumber, and he'd stay in your house until it's done. The difference of making sure it happens compares so much better than just giving advice."" Other services are available to protect multimillion-dollar homes. On the West Coast, for example, where wildfires are often hugely destructive, insurers offer some form of wildfire protection or remediation services.

Annmarie Camp, an executive vice president at Chubb Personal Risk Services, said one part of the company's wildfire service was to help clients clear brush from around the property as regular maintenance, but then be ready with sprinkler systems and other tools if a fire started. Chubb also scans for hot spots behind walls, which might indicate that a light switch could be a fire hazard. AIG Private Client Group gets involved from the ground up with Smart Build, a complimentary risk-minimization service that is offered to clients building a house with a construction budget of $5 million or more.

Ray Celedinas, president and chief executive of the Celedinas Insurance Group in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., said he had used the Smart Build service when he built his home in West Palm Beach. ""Unlike the mainstream market, they're very proactive on the pre-loss and post-loss side,"" he said. ""They wanted to make sure our home was built as sturdy as possible."" It withstood Hurricane Irma, he said, with only a few roof tiles damaged by a falling tree. Boats were a particular concern when Irma threatened Florida. AIG advised its clients to get their boats out of the water and into secure, dry dock storage. But some boat owners were caught off guard. One owner in Clearwater was trying to find a place to store his yacht, but the boat storage facilities he knew were full. So he called AIG. ""We were able to find some land space to have the yacht pulled out ahead of the storm,"" said Stephen Poux, global head of risk management services and loss prevention at AIG Private Client Group, which provides coverage of up to $5,000 to help subsidize the cost of hauling a boat out of the water. Mr. Poux said that AIG's yacht coverage was led by a former America's Cup sailor who uses his yachting contacts to help boat owners.

Other insurers also rely on the expertise of specialists to attract wealthy clients. Claire Marmion, an art preservationist who owns the Haven Art Group, has worked for several insurers. Ms. Marmion was in Golden Beach to assess the damage to Mr. Alters's art collection. The artworks were still in good shape, but the hole in the roof was worrisome. Within two days, all the art was crated by professional art movers and taken to a climate-controlled storage facility. In trying to cover every possibility, though, some services are created that are never needed. After heavy snowfalls in 2015, Pure put together a roof shoveling team because it did not want clients climbing on their roofs to clear the snow, and it did not want the snow staying there and pushing water into homes. Mr. Buchmueller said the winters had not been as severe since the shoveling team was created. But that's the nature of good plans: They may never be used. And that is the hope of Ms. Marmion, who has a plan for a six-foot-tall Koons sculpture that sits outside a home on Long Island.

Health,Gut Microbes Might Keep Malnourished Children From Growing,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/health/microbiome-malnourishment-children.html,"Long-term malnutrition might at first seem like a medical condition with an easy fix: access to a wholesome diet rich in calories and nutrients. But many of the children on the receiving end of such interventions still struggle to grow. Even when given enough to eat, they end up shorter than their peers and are saddled with cognitive deficits, weakened immune systems and other long-term consequences that tax their brains and bodies alike. The result is a paradox that continues to vex researchers worldwide. Some 150 million children under the age of 5 have stunted growth. ""It's perhaps the single most common nutritional problem that we see all over the world, and there is no single intervention that has worked,"" said Tahmeed Ahmed, senior director of the nutrition and clinical services division of the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh. With so many children imperiled by poor sanitation and food insecurity, it is unlikely that researchers will ever uncover a simple root cause for stunting, Dr. Ahmed said. But in a paper published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, a team led by Dr. Ahmed and Jeff Gordon, a microbiologist at Washington University in St. Louis, may have taken a crucial step toward understanding one driver behind the debilitating condition: the bacteria that reside within the small intestine, where most nutrients are absorbed.

Certain members of this microbial community, the researchers found, may cause a cascade of inflammation in the gut that makes it harder for children to get the most out of their meals. Treatments that target these microbes for elimination -- or perhaps foster friendlier strains -- might someday help physicians rebuild the health of malnourished children. ""The only way to cure malnutrition is with nutrition,"" said Maria Gloria Dominguez Bello, a microbiologist at Rutgers University who was not involved in the study. But for children in whom dietary changes alone are not enough, she added, ""what you want is to break that resilience."" She said that the findings suggested this could be accomplished through interventions that alter the microbiota, the population of microbes in the gut. Data tying intestinal microbes to malnutrition are not new. As a part of a decade-long collaboration, Dr. Ahmed and Dr. Gordon have produced several studies showing that nurturing the gut's microscopic tenants can spur healthy growth in young children, and may even aid recovery after periods of severe weight loss. But a role for gut bacteria in stunting, a condition that results from repeated bouts of undernourishment, has been far less obvious, although a couple of studies have pointed to the possibility in the past. To complicate matters further, some forms of stunting may have origins in persistent inflammation in the small intestine, a disorder called environmental enteric dysfunction, or E.E.D., which can strip away the gut's absorptive lining and stymie its ability to sponge up nutrients. In reality, these three factors -- gut microbes, E.E.D. and stunting -- might all be intricately linked. But researchers have had trouble establishing these relationships in part because the small bowel is so inaccessible. Whereas the contents of the colon can be studied by simply sifting through feces, understanding the upper gut often requires snaking a camera down the throat and through the stomach, an invasive procedure that can be especially risky for very young patients.

Still, that may be a risk worth taking for children with stunting who are not helped by diet alone, Dr. Ahmed said. To identify this population, the researchers recruited more than 500 children from an urban district in Dhaka, Bangladesh, from 2016 to 2018; all were around 18 months old and at high risk of stunting. For three months, each child was given eggs, milk, vitamins and minerals, as well as antiparasitic medications to purge unwanted infections from their gut. Most of the children in the study gained weight and grew, but just over one-fifth of them stayed obstinately small. Most of their small intestines showed signs of inflammation, the researchers found, a possible indicator of E.E.D. An analysis of their gut contents also revealed that many of the children harbored several of the same types of bacteria in their small intestines. None of the microbial members of this ""core group"" of bugs was ""what you'd call a classic pathogen,"" Dr. Gordon said. And yet, ""the more of these bacterial strains you had, the worse the stunting,"" he said. ""That to us was an amazing surprise."" The team then transferred a subset of these bacteria into germ-free mice, each one bred without gut microbes of its own. Shortly after the microbes set up shop in the animals' small intestines, the tissues began to deteriorate -- an apparent mimicry of the inflammatory friendly fire seen in many children with signs of stunting. That bacteria alone can give mice gut inflammation is ""huge, in my mind,"" said Honorine Ward, a microbiologist and immunologist at Tufts University who was not involved in the study. Although it is still unclear whether these dynamics will play out the same way in people, ""this is very convincing, and a really good start,"" said Ana Maria Porras, a microbiologist and tissue engineer at Cornell University who also was not a part of the research team.

And there is more for researchers to learn. For ethical reasons, they analyzed the gut tissues and microbes only of children with signs of stunting, and for whom diet made little difference. ""You can't biopsy healthy children for no reason at all,"" Dr. Ward said. That leaves the portrait of a healthy microbial community in the small intestine ill-defined -- something of a terra incognita, Dr. Gordon said. Without that knowledge, the researchers cannot determine which has a greater influence on gut inflammation, the microbes that are present or or the microbes that are absent, said Arianna Celis Luna, a microbiologist at Stanford University who was not involved in the study. Perhaps bad actors are seeding destruction in the gut, or maybe this intestinal community lacks benign bacteria that could counteract these harmful effects. Finding a humane way to transfer bacteria from healthy children, or from children who can recover from malnutrition through diet alone, into mice may help tease apart those differences, Dr. Dominguez Bello said. There is almost certainly more to the picture, Dr. Gordon said. In the study, children with more inflammation did not experience more stunting. ""So we're missing something,"" he said. And what's true of malnourished children in Bangladesh won't necessarily apply to populations in other parts of the world, Dr. Ahmed added. But the study's findings still hold a great deal of promise for global health, Dr. Ward said. Perhaps future interventions might include treatments that bolster the well-being of not just the human cells in our bodies but the bacterial ones, too. Combating malnutrition may be just as much about feeding our microbes as it is about feeding ourselves. ""We're still a long way from devising those microbiota-based interventions, or even understanding what microbes to use,"" Dr. Ward said. ""But this opens the door to that.""

Fashion & Style,"Cecile Richards, Barbara Bush and the Sisterhood of Political Progeny",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/fashion/cecile-richards-barbara-bush-and-the-sisterhood-of-political-progeny.html,"""I love that you still say y'all!"" Cecile Richards said to Barbara Bush. Within minutes, both women sounded markedly more Texan than they had when they walked into the restaurant. But Texas twangs may be the least of what they have in common. The families of Ms. Bush, 34, daughter of former President George W. Bush and the chief executive of Global Health Corps, a nonprofit organization, and Ms. Richards, 58, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and daughter of former Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas, go way back. At the 1988 Democratic convention, Governor Richards, who died in 2006, got off one of the best one-liners in memory when she said of former President (and candidate at the time) George Bush: ""Poor George. He can't help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth."" His son George W. evened the score in 1994 by beating her decisively in the Texas governor's race.

Before becoming president of Planned Parenthood in 2006, the nation's leading provider of reproductive health services and sex education for women, men and young people, Ms. Richards founded America Votes, a group that coordinates and promotes progressive issues. Before that, she was deputy chief of staff to Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who is now the House minority leader, and worked for many years as a labor organizer. Ms. Bush founded Global Health Corps in 2009 (along with her twin sister, Jenna Bush Hager, and others) to address disparate health results among rich and poor countries. The organization provides yearlong fellowships to young professionals with diverse backgrounds by embedding them in health organizations in Africa and underserved communities in the United States. The number of fellows has grown from 22 in its inaugural year to 140 in its eighth class, which began this month, from a pool of over 5,000 applicants. Over black cod (for Ms. Bush) and branzino (for Ms. Richards), the pair discussed the challenges of growing up in political families; the politicization of health care, especially for women; and the coincidence of appearing in a recent collection of essays, ""What I Told My Daughter: Lessons from Leaders on Raising the Next Generation of Empowered Women,"" edited by Nina Tassler. PHILIP GALANES: Let's start with Nora Ephron, who said that, as a kid, she dreamt of being the president's daughter because of all the attention she'd get, especially from boys. Did that indirect spotlight appeal to you?

BARBARA BUSH: I really didn't notice it. I was so young. When I was 8, I asked a friend when her grandfather's inauguration was. I had just been to my grandfather's, and I assumed everybody had one. PG: How about when your father ran for president? BB: We were 18 then. At 18, you're focused on yourself and where you'll go to college. Our parents wanted that for us. CECILE RICHARDS: I was at a very different time in my life. I was 30 when I moved back to Texas to help with Mom's campaign. I had a 4-year-old daughter and was pregnant with twins at her inauguration. PG: Did you like campaigning for your mother, or was it an obligation?

CR: Oh, there was never any question about it. It's different, running as a woman. And at that point, my mother wasn't married. We were her support system. But it's a mixed bag, seeing your parent run for office. There's a little bit of glamour, but a lot of pain and suffering, watching them go through tough times. BB: I never read the media about my dad. I already had an opinion about him, millions of opinions. I didn't need another person telling me what to think. And when it comes to attacks, people are attacking a caricature. They don't actually know the person. I have the luxury of knowing my parents deeply. CR: A lot of people think of Ann Richards as larger than life. She always said: ""Take me, warts and all."" But I saw the vulnerabilities that the public didn't. One of her favorite things was going to the movies and sitting in the dark. No one could bother her there. PG: You also can't criticize your parents the way we civilians can. The first time I was really aware of Barbara was when you made that P.S.A. for gay marriage. There was a firestorm about your falling out with your father.

PG: It was your media debut. Meanwhile, everyone alive must know about Cecile's marathon testimony before Congress last year over the battle to defund Planned Parenthood. Five hours! Lots of coffee or tranquilizers -- or both? CR: They don't let you do anything. You just sit there, at the pleasure of Congress, while they go in and out, taking breaks and talking in the hallways. I had no idea that it was going to be live-streamed on television, or that so many people would watch. I still have people come up to me on the subway and say they watched all five hours. PG: I couldn't believe how rude the congressmen were. In a weird way, did they do you and Planned Parenthood a favor?

BB: Thanks to my parents, I got lots of exposure. I traveled with them when they launched Pepfar, an amazing program that saves the lives of people with H.I.V. around the world. At that time, if you were H.I.V. positive in the United States, it was just another chronic illness. But in a developing country, it was a death sentence. I met people who were mourning the deaths of their children and sisters, because they didn't have access to drugs that exist. That blew my mind. We have the tools to solve these problems. We just need to use them more effectively. CR: It's the same in reproductive health. We have the technology. But it's not enough unless there's public policy that supports getting women access to care. PG: I can't imagine anyone in America disagreeing with the idea that we should all have health care. So, why is this conversation so poisonous? CR: There's a total disconnect between political rhetoric and where the American people are. They believe folks should have access to health care and family planning. They believe young people should have sex education. No parent wants their child to get an infection, or get pregnant before they're ready. We're at a 30-year low for unintended pregnancy in America. In any other moment, folks would go: ""Wow! Let's do more of that. It's good for women and saves money."" But the political environment is tough right now.

BB: It's crazy, and sad to think that health care is a polarizing issue, because it's not a polarizing space. As a human, I hope everyone is healthy. And what happens in other places matters here. We saw that with Ebola. Everyone started paying attention when it seemed like it might impact us. But diseases don't respect international borders. PG: Do you see big roles for storytelling and empathy? CR: So much shame has been placed on women, for having sex or using birth control or choosing to end a pregnancy. When women tell their stories, it makes a big difference. We learned that from the L.G.B.T. community, in terms of knowing people. Women come up to me all the time and thank me for telling my story, and sometimes they tell me theirs. But I was with three women in Pennsylvania, where they were trying to pass an outrageous, restrictive bill on abortions. These women desperately wanted their pregnancies, but learned at 20 weeks about severe fetal abnormalities. And here they were at a press conference, sharing their anguish in front of clicking cameras. I had two thoughts: What bravery. Then, why should they have to bare their souls? I see empathy every day, but I'm sorry that women still have to share their most personal stories. PG: The much-loathed millennials play big roles in both your organizations. BB: We think millennials are great. So many young people want to work on social change. They want to do good. Global Health started because this great talent pipeline was not moving into health care. It's hard to know how you fit in if you're not a doctor or nurse. If we can demystify that and create channels into Planned Parenthood and other exceptional organizations, then we'll have an army of people working to solve health problems. CR: Ten years ago, when I came to Planned Parenthood, I met these young kids who were called ""peer educators."" They provided sex education in schools and talked to their principals about access to health care. They were in every town. I thought, ""What you really are is leaders."" And the great thing about bringing in thousands of young people to an organization is they begin to change it. One of the things I'm proud of at Planned Parenthood is the number of health centers providing trans care, which was largely driven by young activists.

BB: I didn't know what was in front of me when we were starting Global Health Corps. We didn't even know if anyone would apply. We could never have predicted that a few years in, we'd have gotten to work with 600 amazing young people, 97 percent of whom stay in global health or social justice issues related to it. Our challenge is to keep growing as responsibly as we can. But we see a huge demand. CR: My biggest hope is that we can take partisanship out of this arena. Not to get too political, but we have Republican patients and staff members and board members. The need for health care doesn't come with a party label. Under the Affordable Care Act, every woman who has health insurance gets birth control at no cost. That's 55 million women. We don't have to invent a new kind of birth control. We just have to close the lid between needing it and delivering it. And I'm optimistic that we're on the cusp of making that happen. BB: You've got to be an optimist. PG: Let's end with Nina Tassler's book, ""What I Told My Daughter."" Cecile wrote an essay, and Barbara is the subject of her mom's essay. So, what would you tell young women on the road to empowerment? CR: My mom used to say she saw too many young women passing up opportunities because they were afraid of failing. Her message to me was: ""This is the only life you get. Take every chance and run with it -- even if it doesn't work out."" BB: When I was thinking about starting Global Health, but afraid I wasn't ready, my mom said: ""You're in another job, but always talking about Global Health. Are you going to be happy leaving this on your to-do list forever?"" It's the same with young fellows I speak with. They're worried about taking the ""right"" next step at the ""right"" time. But there's never a right time. Who knows where life is going to take us? CR: Exactly. Just do it. What's the worst that could happen?","The daughters of two former rivals, George W.

Media,"Toni Grant, Psychotherapist, Dies at 73; Her Couch Was on AM Radio",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/09/business/media/toni-grant-therapist-of-the-airwaves-dies-at-73.html,"Toni Grant, one of the first nationally renowned radio psychologists, whose advice on relations between the sexes was celebrated as refreshingly traditional in some quarters and castigated as appallingly pre-feminist in others, died on March 27 in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 73.

The cause was complications of dementia, her daughter Courtney Raspin said.

A clinical psychologist, Dr. Grant was known for her soothing, honeyed voice; her pragmatic approach to listeners' questions about a cornucopia of delicate subjects -- marriage, divorce, sex, dating, cross-dressing, child rearing -- and advice that, while it pulled no punches, was far less bellicose than that of some psychologists who followed her onto the airwaves.

She was first given her own show on KABC-AM in Los Angeles in 1975. The show, which later moved to KFI-AM there, was syndicated nationally in the early 1980s. Eventually heard on more than 180 stations, it became one of the first psychological call-in shows to reach a wide listenership.

Dr. Grant, who described her show as ""a soap opera that educates,"" remained on the air until 1990. After a hiatus, she returned to the radio from 1997 to 2001.","Dr. Grant, who described her show as ""a soap opera that educates,"" was on the air for almost 20 years.",0b04043d-409e-5140-811e-828e56f189b8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/09/arts/09GrantObit/09GrantObit-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=a466eba96012778298da95bc594f6c79b2477f1edeb3600f362f17ca5580eb28&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The radio psychologist Toni Grant with Frank Sinatra Jr. in 1981 at a charity auction in Beverly Hills, Calif.",0b04043d-409e-5140-811e-828e56f189b8,N24News/imgs/0b04043d-409e-5140-811e-828e56f189b8.jpg,16
Media,"Trump, Asked About Accusations Against Bill O'Reilly, Calls Him a 'Good Person'",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/business/media/trump-oreilly-fox-murdochs.html,"Bill O'Reilly, the embattled Fox News host, received a powerful show of support on Wednesday from a longtime friend, interview subject, ideological sympathizer and fellow scandal-survivor: the president of the United States. Speaking in the Oval Office, Donald J. Trump praised Mr. O'Reilly as ""a good person"" and declared, ""I don't think Bill did anything wrong,"" days after The New York Times reported that five women had received settlements after making harassment claims against him. News of the payouts, totaling about $13 million, generated a storm of criticism toward Fox News, which recently renewed Mr. O'Reilly's contract, and prompted more than two dozen advertisers to withdraw their support of Mr. O'Reilly's prime time show, the highest-rated program in cable news. Few have spoken out publicly in support of the Fox star. The president had no qualms. ""Personally, I think he shouldn't have settled,"" Mr. Trump told Times reporters in a wide-ranging interview. ""Because you should have taken it all the way; I don't think Bill did anything wrong.""

""I think he's a person I know well,"" Mr. Trump said. ""He is a good person."" The president is a well-documented fan of Fox News, sitting for interviews with its prime-time hosts and conferring privately by phone with Rupert Murdoch, the network's executive chairman. Mr. Trump has bragged to associates that he now refers to Mr. Murdoch, one of the world's most powerful media moguls, by his first name, according to a person who is friendly with both men. But the president has a particular rapport with Mr. O'Reilly, whose hectoring braggadocio and no-apologies nostalgia for a bygone American era mirror Mr. Trump's own. A regular guest on ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" Mr. Trump has attended baseball games with Mr. O'Reilly, praised his collection of best-selling political books, and, as president-elect, granted him a prominent interview that aired during Fox's Super Bowl pregame show. The men share a taste for vanilla milkshakes, bantering on-air about how many of the confections Mr. O'Reilly has bought for his friend.

When damaging video footage of Mr. Trump bragging about sexual assault surfaced during the campaign, Mr. Trump called it ""locker room talk"" and apologized for the remarks. Mr. O'Reilly, on air that evening, allowed that the tape was ""an embarrassment"" for the Republican nominee. But he also criticized The Washington Post, the newspaper that published the footage.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. It is remarkable for a sitting president to weigh in on sexual harassment allegations from the Oval Office, especially allegations at the center of a churning controversy. But Mr. Trump's advice to his friend on Wednesday -- that Mr. O'Reilly ""shouldn't have settled"" -- was consistent with the never-back-down ethos of a president, and former real estate magnate, who relishes the counterattack. It also hinted at a deeper symbiosis between the White House and Fox News. Mr. Trump often praises the network, recently urging his 27 million Twitter followers to tune in for a Saturday evening show; last month, the president cited a Fox commentator, Andrew Napolitano, as backup for an unproven allegation that British intelligence spied on his campaign. In turn, Fox News's prime time and morning hosts are blatant champions of the administration -- to the extent that NBC News's chairman, Andrew Lack, recently compared the network to ""state broadcasting."" The president and Mr. Murdoch have drawn closer, too. Mr. Murdoch, a savvy political observer, deepened their relationship in the months after Mr. Trump clinched the Republican nomination, and people who know them say the two now speak frequently. Mr. Murdoch's former wife, Wendi Deng, is so close with Ivanka Trump that the president's daughter became a trustee of the Murdoch children's fortune. (Ms. Trump stepped down from the role in December.)","The president praised the embattled Fox News host in an interview with The New York Times and said, ""I don't think Bill did anything wrong.""",b7165f57-49a0-5f4d-86ac-72f0a4340406,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/06/business/06trumporeilly1/06trumporeilly1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=e1242d52197c45746b995012aa7ba6620d105d3674b769b5285580a1f5b61d23&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Donald Trump speaking with Bill O'Reilly during a Yankees game in 2009.,b7165f57-49a0-5f4d-86ac-72f0a4340406,N24News/imgs/b7165f57-49a0-5f4d-86ac-72f0a4340406.jpg,16
Fashion & Style,Vetements Brings Its Brand of Disruption to Couture,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/fashion/vetements-couture.html,"To hear Demna Gvasalia, the leader of Vetements, a guerrilla collective cum fashion label, tell it, the inspiration behind his most famous pieces was purely practical. He and his team created a bright yellow DHL logo T-shirt -- a takeoff on the kind the shipping company's employees wear -- because DHL was a constant in the life of the young brand, essential for sending samples and prototypes internationally between factories, studio and showroom. The T-shirt became the opening look of his spring 2016 show, held in a dingy Chinese restaurant, on a cast of defiantly odd friends and models. ""We get inspired by our everyday life,"" Mr. Gvasalia, 35, said in an interview in Paris, where he divides his time between the Vetements studio on the scruffy rue du Faubourg Saint-Martin and the palatial offices of Balenciaga, where he was named artistic director in 2015. ""DHL takes the biggest part of our daily routine in the office. It was there."" For the same reason, the line made the cult hoodie whose Vetements logo sent up or saluted the Champion logo (depending on your point of view). ""We all have Champion hoodies,"" Mr. Gvasalia said.

Of course, not every DHL T-shirt is a high-fashion item, and not every Champion hoodie costs $775, as Vetements's approximation did. Just as not every brand celebrated for its calculated disruption and assault on the status quo is invited to be part of the most elite week in fashion, during the haute couture. On Sunday Vetements will effectively open the couture season. And it will do so with the support and collaboration of 17 established fashion brands including Levi's, Hanes, Reebok, Juicy Couture, Brioni, Manolo Blahnik and Mackintosh. It is a measure of how far Vetements, which Mr. Gvasalia and his co-founders started in 2014, has come in two years, and how fast, that fashion and apparel companies, from the luxurious to the mass market, are now lining up to work with him, and that the industry czars are bending backward to accommodate him. ""The embrace of the industry is quite incredible, for where we've come from and how long we exist,"" Mr. Gvasalia said. The line is carried in more than 200 stores worldwide, and Guram Gvasalia, 30, Demna's brother and Vetements's chief executive, cites sales in the eight figures.

""We have a lot of demand for couture, a lot,"" said Ralph Toledano, the body's president. ""We could not take everybody. But the Vetements approach was interesting. You have to promote new ideas, to help new designers with new houses."" Asked whether any of the more traditional couture houses balked at Vetements's inclusion, he laughed. ""When you are strong, you are never afraid of anyone,"" he said. Mr. Gvasalia said the decision to work with outside brands was intended to simplify the collection's production in the newly truncated time frame. ""To spread the work around so we could just chill and do concepts,"" he said. It did not, he admitted, quite work out that way. Collaborating with 17 brands around the world was a logistical challenge. Still, besides Vetements's own dresses, every piece in the spring collection will be a collaboration, double-labeled and double-branded. The collection will be shown at Galeries Lafayette, the Paris department store, which is fitting: Vetements has essentially recast itself as a department store unto itself, a one-stop shop for a full wardrobe's worth of brands and products. Mr. Gvasalia and his team went to work taking the products that each individual label is known for or does best (T-shirts for Hanes, heels for Manolo Blahnik) and reworking it a la Vetements, which often amounts to a sort of creative defacement.

""I told him we'd probably want to wash and boil and burn the shoes, is it O.K. for you?"" Mr. Gvasalia said of his conversation with Mr. Blahnik. ""He said, 'Please!'"" It was an adjustment for some -- ""We'd get pieces, cut them up, send them back, and get shocked emails that said, basically, 'What happened?'"" Mr. Gvasalia said -- but ultimately the collaborators all agreed to Vetementize. The potential rewards for a brand, especially one not typically acknowledged by high fashion, were great. ""It's our first time on the Paris couture runway,"" said Adriana Rizzo, the senior director of product for Lucchese, which has been making cowboy boots in Texas since 1883. Even for globally recognized companies, the chance to be part of the Vetements gang outweighed any hesitations. ""It was a relatively easy decision to make,"" said Chris Haggarty, the managing director of Champion Products Europe, who agreed quickly when Vetements approached him, despite the fact that it had ""bent the rules"" by producing the original, Championesque merchandise without permission.

""You never know -- these brands come and go, some last for a long time, some lose their appeal,"" Mr. Haggarty said. ""They were so hot at the moment and so current, we thought we should make the most of it while we have the opportunity."" The rewards are also plenty for Vetements. The project leverages the savoir faire of its partners -- the tailoring expertise of Brioni, say -- to create what Mr. Gvasalia called ""a modern idea of couture, to make the product with the best manufacturer that does it."" (""He went to town,"" said Justin O'Shea, Brioni's creative director.) It leaves Vetements in control of its commercial destiny, with the company in charge of the sales, distribution and pricing for all the collaborative pieces. And it elevates Vetements's status by association. Levi's, Hanes, Schott: all are in the pantheon of great brands. Now by implication, so is Vetements, vaulted from the underground fringes to the center of the establishment. ""We were honestly a little bit surprised when they reached out to us,"" said Sidney Falken, the chief branding officer of Hanesbrands, ""but delighted by it."" Both Demna and Guram Gvasalia emphasized their respect for their collaborators. ""Vetements this season is like a glue that brings all the brands together,"" said Guram.","Fashion's ultimate outsider brand is about to become the ultimate insider. And Manolo Blahnik, Juicy Couture and Levi's are helping.",af4cc7a2-b4cb-58f5-b732-3f9a1460656a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/03/fashion/03vetements/03vetements-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=66f2fa00dd0ff3e10cf7ebb34fd10093bfa748edeb47dc3d17c69e82263c9dbf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Demna Gvasalia of Vetements.,af4cc7a2-b4cb-58f5-b732-3f9a1460656a,N24News/imgs/af4cc7a2-b4cb-58f5-b732-3f9a1460656a.jpg,19
Music,"Justin Bieber's Flavorless Pivot to R&B, and 10 More New Songs",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/arts/music/playlist-justin-bieber-mac-miller.html,"Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week's most notable new songs and videos. Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage.

Considering he's been one of the biggest pop stars of the 21st century since he was 15 years old, Justin Bieber has always been conspicuously uninterested in pop music. Its artificiality doesn't suit him. Its polish is antithetical to his just-woke-up charms. And the neutrality of voice it favors -- well, Bieber has different tastes. His voice is gentle and a little creamy, and he's a clear child of 1990s R&B, so much so that at least one critic was inspired to start a campaign to #LetJustinSingRnB.

Here we are, finally. ""Yummy"" is a return to his ... roots? A modest and lazily seductive number, it's the most overt pivot to R&B he's released (apart from his overlooked acoustic-ish work). He sounds comfortable, but also choppy, thanks to the particularly hiccupy patchwork that's the hallmark of modern pop production. And while his syllables glide easily, he's hobbled by lyrics that feel awkward and a little hasty (""Rolling eyes back in my head, make my toes curl, yeah, yeah""). When that other Justin -- Timberlake -- made his R&B transition all those years ago, he was bolstered by some of the most adventurous production of the day. But the choices here are safe, never testing nor encouraging Bieber. It's a step in the right the direction, but the campaign continues. JON CARAMANICA

""Keep away from me if you can't withstand my love,"" the Jamaican-British songwriter Celeste -- named the 2020 rising star at the Brit Awards -- warns in a testament to obsession, driven by an insistent minor-key piano vamp derived from Nina Simone's ""Sinnerman."" Is it her desperate clinging or her lover's fear of commitment that's pushing them apart? She starts out almost matter-of-fact; by the chorus, she's wailing in frustration and accusation. JON PARELES

A few weeks before hosting the Grammy Awards, here's Alicia Keys at her most benevolent: singing about the hopes of bus-stop peddlers, single mothers, teachers, student doctors, soldiers and taxi drivers, all with a chance for solidarity through ""the things that change us if we notice when we look up."" Powered by piano chords, handclaps and a male choir, she promises a chance for all to ""rise up"" -- a secular-gospel challenge to division and cynicism. PARELES

The first posthumous single from Mac Miller is ""Good News,"" which tempers musical whimsy with melancholic wordplay. It's from a forthcoming album, ""Circles,"" due next Friday, which Miller had been working on with the producer Jon Brion. (The new album is designed to be the companion piece to Miller's LP ""Swimming,"" which he released last year, a month before his death at 26.) Miller raps with a meandering unease: ""Good news, good news, good news, that's all they wanna hear/No, they don't like it when I'm down."" The tone is heavy, burdened, exhausted. But Miller had an ability to leaven even sentiments as dark as these. ""Wake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while,"" he raps, ""But I heard that the sky's still blue."" CARAMANICA

Another one from the too-big-to-fail peak-reggaeton era of pop-minded production and fail-safe collaborations. This partnership, however, is notable: Daddy Yankee and Nicky Jam are two contemporary superstars whose history dates back to Puerto Rico's reggaeton's scene of the 1990s. They often performed together as Los Cangris, but their friendship did not survive, especially after Daddy Yankee's global breakout hit ""Gasolina"" in 2004. This reunion -- from the soundtrack of the forthcoming film ""Bad Boys for Life"" -- is welcome, if a little dry. The chorus borrows its cadence from Ini Kamoze's 1994 reggae hit ""Here Comes the Hotstepper."" The name is borrowed, too, from the 1991 track by the Panamanian reggaeton star El General, one of the earliest reggaeton crossover hits. CARAMANICA

Joey Alexander released his first at album five years ago, at age 11, shortly after moving to the United States from Indonesia. These days, he seems to be having little trouble transitioning from child prodigy to full-grown protagonist. He is constantly adding to his improvising playbook, incorporating new moves into an increasingly seamless expression, and fleshing out what was already an impressively ambidextrous piano style. You can hear it on ""Warna,"" the title track from his forthcoming Verve debut, whose title means ""color"" in Bahasa. His all-star trio, featuring the bassist Larry Grenadier and the drummer Kendrick Scott, is augmented here by the Venezuelan percussionist Luisito Quintero, who puts his own stamp on an Alexander original built from a mix of Southeast Asian and African rhythms.

The eminent tenor saxophonist Charles Lloyd celebrated his 80th birthday in 2018 with a performance in his Santa Barbara, Calif. hometown, backstroking into his vast catalog with a quintet of younger musicians. To those that know his work, Lloyd's arrival into his ninth decade was hardly jarring: He has been playing the role of jazz elder and bodhisattva for decades. At the same time, he has somehow sidestepped the effects of age: His style is one of slippery kinetics -- like fast streams of water coiling through rough rock -- and it seems to have kept him young. Playing his decades-old ballad ""Requiem"" in Santa Barbara, he sounded as poised and spry as ever, lifted by the loose coherence of his compatriots. A two-CD (or three-LP) recording of the concert, ""8, Kindred Spirits: Live from the Lobero,"" is due out Valentine's Day.

Dance,"Review: In 'Whale,' Gallim Dance Takes On Love",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/05/arts/dance/review-in-whale-gallim-dance-takes-on-love.html,"Since 2007, when the ambitious young choreographer Andrea Miller founded her company, Gallim Dance, her work has often seemed desperate to grow up fast. The telltale signs were heavy borrowings from established choreographers and a general sense of struggling to appear mature. So it comes as a relief -- and possibly even a sign of maturation -- that her new piece, ""Whale,"" begins with young dancers behaving like young dancers.

In front of a semicircle of folding chairs that could have been arranged for a school dance at the gym, the eight cast members bounce around as if on sugar highs, hurling themselves through the air, knocking one another over and singing about love. It's kind of fun.

The fun doesn't last, alas, but what follows in the overlong work (90 minutes, including intermission) is significantly less affected and false than usual. Love is the theme, or rather intemperate desire and need. The audacious dancers hug at ramming speed. A woman humps a man's legs the way a dog might. He looks unsure how to respond.

Among theatrical devices that call to mind pieces by other choreographers is a sequence of groping set to a club beat, suggesting group sex. (The score is by Jordan Chiolis, who plays it on laptop and drums with Robert Natale.) Ms. Miller's usual recipe of Ohad Naharin eccentricity appears to have been spiced with some Stephen Petronio eroticism. There are strobe lights. (The uncharacteristically unsubtle lighting is by Nicole Pearce.) There is nudity, though the naked man (Paul Vickers) is less sexual than infantile, nuzzling himself into pre-existing embraces as a baby might with its parents.",Andrea Miller's young troupe takes a refreshingly youthful approach in an engagement at the Joyce Theater.,46404d57-3a8c-5591-991e-350c60d2b6eb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/05/arts/GALLIM/GALLIM-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=452d72fbfa1e5f85ebbb5b447a0555306307b57bfc217e2f9af1effa729f2c8c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Gallim Dance members in ""Whale.""",46404d57-3a8c-5591-991e-350c60d2b6eb,N24News/imgs/46404d57-3a8c-5591-991e-350c60d2b6eb.jpg,6
Art & Design,African Officials Respond to France's Restitution Report,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/arts/design/africa-macron-report-restitution.html,"Initial responses from African officials to a report issued last week by France on the return of looted treasures from the continent reveal the path to restitution will be a thorny one. The report, commissioned by President Emmanuel Macron of France, recommended that all objects removed without consent from Africa and sent to France be permanently returned if the countries of origin ask for them. The first African official to react to the report, which has been met with trepidation by some museum directors in Europe, was Senegal's culture minister, Abdou Latif Coulibaly. Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Coulibaly called for the return of all Senegalese artwork held in French museums and institutions. ""We are ready to find solutions with France,"" Mr. Coulibaly said. ""But if 10,000 pieces are identified in the collections, we are asking for all 10,000.""

Senegal was one of the African countries highlighted in the report, which was written by two academics, Benedicte Savoy of France and Felwine Sarr of Senegal. In preparing the report, the two traveled to Senegal, as well as to Benin, Mali and Cameroon, to meet with government officials, museum directors and art specialists. Mr. Coulibaly's reaction, while not a formal claim, runs counter to the report's assurance that its recommendations would not see the widespread removal of all African objects from France's museums. ""There is no question, either for us or for our African counterparts, of emptying French or European museums to fill up African ones,"" Ms. Savoy, an art historian and professor at the Technical University of Berlin and a professor at the College de France, said in a previous interview with The Times. Rather, the aim of the recommendations is to achieve ""a rebalancing of the geography of African heritage in the world, which is currently extremely imbalanced, as European museums have almost everything, and African museums have almost nothing,"" Ms. Savoy said. Alexander Herman, assistant director of the Institute of Art and Law, an educational organization in Britain, said the practicalities of implementing the return of all Senegalese objects would be challenging.

""France and Senegal would have to enter into a bilateral agreement, out of which a commission would be established to determine, on a case-by-case basis, which Senegalese artifacts should be returned,"" he said in an interview on Friday. The report noted that artifacts acquired through documented transactions could be retained by French museums. ""Not everything would return to Senegal, even if the rather ambitious terms of the report are followed,"" Mr. Herman said. The response from the Ivory Coast was more in line with the report's position. On Wednesday, a government spokesman, Sidi Toure, said the country had identified a number of objects to be returned. ""Ivory Coast has drawn up a list of about a hundred masterpieces,"" Mr. Toure said in a statement. He added that specifics regarding the requested artifacts would be sent to French officials appointed to handle restitution requests. Mr. Toure said the returned objects would go to the national museum of Ivory Coast in Abidjan, which ""is able to recover and accommodate these different works when they are back."" The item at the top of Mr. Toure's list is a ceremonial drum from the people of the Abidjan region, which is currently housed in the Quai Branly Museum in Paris.",Government officials from Senegal and the Ivory Coast ask for African treasures to be returned.,d0d88b5a-3e32-5271-804f-325efcef1401,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/01/arts/01senegal-item-1/01senegal-item-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=cd83b46d3e5a2e19dc3bfc51d8a72f1e1e3a21a08a0866d8d10c01285a8f5fe4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Senegal's culture minister, Abdou Latif Coulibaly, who on Tuesday called for the return of all Senegalese artwork held in French museums and institutions.",d0d88b5a-3e32-5271-804f-325efcef1401,N24News/imgs/d0d88b5a-3e32-5271-804f-325efcef1401.jpg,14
Style,A Tour of a Design Dealer's Small Apartment in Chelsea,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/style/patrick-parrish-design-dealer-apartment-chelsea.html,"HIS FAVORITE ROOM For nearly two decades, this 450-square-foot, rent-stabilized apartment was Mr. Parrish's bachelor pad. Now he's married, and the living area is where he hangs out with his 2-year-old son, Clyde. And soon the apartment will be a memory: The growing family is moving to a bigger place in Brooklyn.

There must be a lot of history for you here. I moved in here because a friend of mine told me, ""I know an apartment that would be perfect for you. It's a one-bedroom, and it's less than two blocks from the flea market."" Because I was going to the flea market every Saturday and Sunday. I would get there between 4 and 4:30 a.m., rain or shine. I was picking and selling to other dealers.

Was it sad to see those flea-market lots become apartment towers? Yeah, it was. In the beginning, there were eight places where you could buy stuff. Now there's one -- and there's no one there. I'm up with Clyde. We could go to the flea market, but I just can't do it. I just burned out.

As a design-minded person, does it drive you crazy to have toys everywhere? He's got pretty good taste. This vintage Austrian toy that's like a Tinker Toy but more modernist -- I found it and I showed it to him and he just loved it. The other stuff, like this bus, I'm not really into. I am into what he did to it, the way he stickered it up. That's cool. Let's talk about your own toys. Is that a Calder sculpture? It looks a lot like Calder, and it came out of an estate that had Calders. So is it Calder? I need to send it to the Calder Foundation, but I just never have. If it is a Calder, that's amazing. But if it's not, I'm going to think about it differently. For now, it's potential. You could say the same of your impending life in Brooklyn. It's a little scary to move. You know, this apartment has always had a great vibe to it. It's always been quiet, it's always been comfortable. It sounds cliche, but it's home, even though it's little. It's a great neighborhood, and I'll miss it. But it's time for a change.","When Patrick Parrish became a father, his curated living room became filled with his son's curated toys.",13535153-e110-5c6c-8b0a-b0925f95cc15,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/01/fashion/02MYSPACE1/02MYSPACE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=623f68da9de78095da333c359c04341fda78b3e9175b8dac539043ce941c42d1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Patrick Parrish, a design dealer, with his son, Clyde, in the small Chelsea apartment in New York he has lived in for nearly two decades.",13535153-e110-5c6c-8b0a-b0925f95cc15,N24News/imgs/13535153-e110-5c6c-8b0a-b0925f95cc15.jpg,15
Opinion,Why I'm Voting to Acquit President Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/opinion/trump-impeachment-acquitttal.html,"Rushing an impeachment case through the House without due process and giving the Senate a half-baked case to finish set a dangerous precedent. If the Senate were to convict, it would risk making this kind of quick, partisan impeachment in the House a regular occurrence. That would serve only to further deepen the divides that seem to permeate every part of our society today.

People certainly see this divide in Congress. Many believe their elected representatives on both sides of the aisle have lost sight of what's important and are focusing on politics and partisanship rather than results for the American people.

While the Senate is where this impeachment process will end, it is also the Senate that is best suited to help turn the page and begin a new chapter. We can do that by demonstrating that we can work together and address the issues our constituents care most about. I believe it is possible for both parties to come together for consensus solutions on these three issues:

Lowering Prescription Drug Costs. Researchers are producing life-changing medicines, but all that progress does us no good if they're unaffordable. It's gotten so bad that some Americans have to choose between paying their mortgage or rent and being able to afford expensive prescription drugs. In the Senate, three committees have approved legislation intended to help lower out-of-pocket costs for senior citizens, crack down on the high prices set by drug manufacturers and end surprise billing practices that have devastated families with shocking medical bills. The House has its own plan. The president wants to get this done and there is no reason we should not be able to find common ground here.

Improving Skills Training. Everywhere I go in Ohio, employers tell me they need workers who have the skills to fill available jobs -- well-paying work as welders, coders and health care technicians, all of which require skills training. I'm working with Senator Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, to pass legislation called the JOBS Act to ensure that Pell grants can be used to cover short-term training programs for these careers. That would help fill well-paid, in-demand jobs and get more people off the sidelines and into our economy. This legislation is bipartisan, and ready to go.",Impeachment will end in the Senate.

Health,Study Suggests Dense Breast Tissue Isn't Always a High Cancer Risk,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/19/health/study-finds-dense-breast-tissue-isnt-always-a-high-cancer-risk.html,"Dr. Karla Kerlikowske, a breast cancer researcher, goes over mammogram readouts displaying different stages of breast density, at the Veterans Affairs Hospital in San Francisco.

A new study offers help to patients and doctors who are trying to deal with mammogram results that many women consider troubling and confusing: the finding of ""dense"" breast tissue. Not only is breast density linked to an increased risk of cancer, it also makes cancer harder to detect because dense tissue can hide tumors from X-rays. But the new research indicates that not all women with dense breasts are at very high risk. Patient advocates urge women with dense breasts to ask doctors about extra tests like ultrasound or an M.R.I. to check for tumors that mammography might have missed. Studies have found that those exams can improve detection of tumors over mammography alone in dense breasts. Pressed by advocacy groups, 22 states have passed laws requiring that breast density be reported to mammography patients, and similar federal legislation has been introduced in the House and the Senate.

The new study, published on Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine, suggests that only about half of women with dense tissue are at such a high risk that they need extra tests. Instead of looking at density alone, women and their doctors should also consider other risk factors when making decisions about additional screening, the researchers concluded. ""While mammography is currently the best screening tool we have, there are women for whom mammography is not enough,"" said Dr. Constance Lehman, an author of the study and the director of breast imaging at the University of Washington in Seattle. ""We hope this work can help women be better informed regarding whether or not supplemental screening, such as with ultrasound or with M.R.I., should be considered,"" she said. The study, by a large team of experts in breast cancer and epidemiology, was done in part because many doctors thought that the laws and advocacy groups had gotten ahead of the science. About 45 percent of all women have dense breasts, but not every woman with that finding has a high risk of cancer. Some experts warned that the new laws would give some women bad news that did not necessarily apply to them and lead to a demand for unnecessary, expensive tests that could swamp the health care system.

""I was trying to focus in on who's really at high risk of having their breast cancer not seen on mammography,"" said Dr. Karla Kerlikowske, the first author of the study and a professor of medicine and epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco. ""It can't be 45 percent of people."" Dense breasts have a relatively high proportion of glandular or connective tissue, which shows up as white on mammograms. Tumors also appear white, so dense tissue can hide them. Non-dense breasts have more fat, which looks dark on mammograms, so tumors stand out more easily. Density can be detected only by mammograms and is reported in one of four categories, from ""almost entirely fatty"" to ""extremely dense."" The study findings are based on the medical records of 365,426 women ages 40 to 74 who had screening mammograms from 2002 through 2011. The researchers wanted to know if they could detect whether, among all the women with dense breasts, any distinct subgroups had a higher risk than others of developing an ""interval"" cancer, meaning one that is found less than a year after a normal mammogram. Such tumors, usually found when a patient or her doctors feel a lump, may have been present but not detected by the mammogram. The report uses breast density assessments along with an online calculator that estimates a woman's risk of developing breast cancer in the next five years. The calculator asks five questions: a woman's age, her race, breast density as reported from mammograms, whether she has ever needed a breast biopsy and whether her mother, sisters or daughters have ever had breast cancer. The calculator categorizes each woman's risk as low, average, intermediate, high or very high. A five-year risk up to 1.66 percent is considered low to average; more than 4 percent is very high.

The study found that women with certain combinations of breast density and five-year risk levels had the highest odds of an interval cancer. Two groups had high rates of interval cancer, defined as more than one case per 1,000 mammograms. One group included women with a five-year risk of 1.67 percent or higher and extremely dense breasts. The second group had a five-year risk of 2.5 percent or higher and ""heterogeneously dense"" findings on mammography. Women with a five-year risk of 2.5 percent or higher and heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts -- 21 percent of all women with dense breasts -- were also the most likely to have interval cancers that were advanced, the study found. These women with the highest risk are the most likely to benefit from additional tests after a normal mammogram, the authors said. An accompanying editorial said the study provided ""compelling evidence"" that density alone should not be the basis for deciding whether to have additional screening. The study authors provided an example of one way the information might be used for a sample of 100,000 women with dense breasts in mammograms. If they all had additional tests, about 89 interval cancers would be found. One cancer would have been discovered for every 1,124 tests administered. But if the extra testing were limited to only the two groups of high-risk women singled out in the study, 24,294 women from the sample would have the tests, and about 35 interval cancers would be found. So it would have taken 694 tests to diagnose one cancer.",New research published in Annals of Internal Medicine suggested that only about half of women with dense tissue need extra tests.,4c77119f-29ad-53eb-bec5-3424b0b618c9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/19/science/19breast/19breast-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=5e405fcd331b661814a242612a2a9ebcb5a86390680db29dc1a1a5b3ece568b5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dr. Karla Kerlikowske, a breast cancer researcher, goes over mammogram readouts displaying different stages of breast density,  at the Veterans Affairs Hospital in San Francisco.",4c77119f-29ad-53eb-bec5-3424b0b618c9,N24News/imgs/4c77119f-29ad-53eb-bec5-3424b0b618c9.jpg,1
Books,She Persisted: Girls Find a Way to Live on Their Own Terms,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/books/review/princess-cora-and-the-crocodile-laura-amy-schlitz.html,"She entreats her fairy godmother for help. Maybe she should've been more specific, because help arrives in the form of a crocodile, delivered in a box with air holes. The crocodile takes Cora's place in exchange for cream puffs. He keeps his promise not to eat anyone but wreaks havoc, which we see juxtaposed with Cora's sweet day of climbing trees and stepping in cow pies. The Newbery medalist (for ""Good Masters! Sweet Ladies!"") Laura Amy Schlitz's witty writing matches perfectly with the energetic watercolors by Brian Floca, who won the Caldecott Medal for ""Locomotive."" I dare you not to laugh at the pink-frocked reptile desperately trying to jump rope. In the end the adults are suitably chastened and Cora asserts herself to find a compromise -- just two baths a day. And about that dog. . . .

Donna Jo Napoli and David Wiesner's graphic novel ""Fish Girl"" is a darker, stranger story. There are no doting parents. Fish Girl is kept in her boardwalk aquarium home by a sinister man calling himself the god Neptune. He claims to have rescued her from fishermen. If she's seen, he says, scientists will take her and cut her open. So she teases audiences with glimpses, in exchange for Neptune's stories of where she came from. Nameless and mute, she is resigned to her life, until she's spotted by a girl her age.

They become friends, and through their secret sisterhood Fish Girl acquires what Neptune desperately didn't want her to have: a name, a voice and the courage to uncover the truth behind her stifling home. In a powerful climax she stands (yes, stands) over the false god and takes her place on his throne. The surreal and sometimes unsettling story is grounded by the three-time Caldecott medalist Wiesner's soft, realistic artwork, and Napoli's spare text transports us inside Fish Girl's head as she pieces things together. This is not a funny book. Fish Girl is in a dangerous situation, and the idea of a grown man keeping a child in a tank is not pleasant. But that makes her determination and bravery to become what she wants to be all the more powerful, and in the end Mother Nature puts things right (though there is no jail time for Neptune, unfortunately).

Do not hesitate to give these books to boys as well as girls -- in fact, I would encourage it. Each of these girls found a way to live on her own terms. You can even imagine them as friends, meeting in their lovely watercolor worlds.","In ""Princess Cora and the Crocodile"" by Laura Amy Schlitz and ""Fish Girl"" by Donna Jo Napoli, two young heroines cast off constraints.",62adacf9-5c24-5efb-b789-1fe462edbe08,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/12/books/review/0312-BKS-Brosgol01/0312-BKS-Brosgol01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=518&w=991&s=86cb5b58a74c7db0ab6fe17eee2dec7759a3ed9227cdd7125493a1ae6fd8f965&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From ""Princess Cora and the Crocodile.""",62adacf9-5c24-5efb-b789-1fe462edbe08,N24News/imgs/62adacf9-5c24-5efb-b789-1fe462edbe08.jpg,13
Style,"She's 26, and Brought Down Uber's C.E.O. What's Next?",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/21/style/susan-fowler-uber.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Susan Fowler was, she recalls, ""over the moon"" in January 2016. At 24, she had just snagged her dream job as a site reliability engineer at Uber, which had recruited her by telling her the ride-hailing company was a ""super-women-friendly"" place to work, boasting 25 percent female engineers. And she had her first date with the man who would become her husband, Chad Rigetti, who runs a quantum computing start-up in Berkeley, Calif., and who, she says dreamily, is as ""beautiful"" as Michael Fassbender. After a movie, she pulled out her phone and opened up her Uber app to get them a car home. ""No, no, no,"" Mr. Rigetti told her. ""I don't use Uber."" ""I only use Lyft,"" he said. ""Did you read that interview with the C.E.O., Travis, where he talked about how Uber helps him get girls? He's a misogynist. I could never use his product."" Ms. Fowler smiles ruefully at the memory, during her first interview since she became instantly famous. As we sit in the Clift Hotel's lobby cafe, decorated with black-and-white animal tiles, it's startling to think that this is the woman who pierced the self-indulgent, adolescent Pleasure Island mentality of Silicon Valley, causing the stunning downfall of Travis ""we call that 'Boob-er'"" Kalanick and starting a bonfire on creepy sexual behavior in Silicon Valley that, fueled by a report in The Times and cascading stories, spread to Hollywood and engulfed Harvey Weinstein and Amazon's Roy Price.

Dressed in black jeans, brown loafers, a denim jacket -- ""the only clothes I can fit into"" -- and wearing a Fitbit with a hot pink band that cost her $1 on Amazon, Ms. Fowler is 26 and seven months pregnant. She looks so young that people give her ""weird looks,"" she says, worried that she will be a teenage mother. She is petite, with an angelic smile and an air of innocence that belies a fierce will. Her Instagram account features a picture of Charlie Brown saying, ""Be the best you can be""; a coffee mug with the motto from Apollo 13, ""Failure is not an option""; and books she is reading on a wide array of subjects including ants. She describes herself as ""an amateur myrmecologist."" As Kara Swisher wrote in Recode, Ms. Fowler did everyone in tech a favor by unmasking the donkeys ""worshiped as kings"" by the venture capitalists and investors and boards and even the media, felling them with one ""epic"" 2,900-word blog post ""about what happens when a hot company becomes hostage to its increasingly dysfunctional and toxic behaviors."" No doubt when Mr. Kalanick met the wide-eyed Ms. Fowler at the office Christmas party soon after she started, it never entered his head that she would become the disciplinarian who effectively confiscated his car keys for reckless driving with one blog post. Yet it was a role that Ms. Fowler had been preparing for her whole life. The Peter Pan libertines met their match in a sweet Stoic.

She had what she calls an ""unconventional upbringing,"" the second child of seven in a small town in rural Arizona called Yarnell. Her father was an evangelical Assemblies of God preacher who sold pay phones on weekdays and, with his wife, home-schooled Susan and her siblings. She ended up never going to high school. ""So I was kind of on my own,"" she says. ""I tried to read the classics, would go to the library a lot, tried to teach myself things. But didn't really have any direction. I really had this dream that someday I could be educated."" She read Plutarch's ""Lives."" ""The Stoics were really what changed me,"" she says. ""Because their whole thing was about, 'You don't have control over a lot of the things that determine your life, so all you can do is focus on becoming the best person that you can be.' And that really spoke to me because I did feel, especially during my teenage years, that my life was really out of my control. I really wished that I could just learn and do all the fun things and cool extracurriculars that I thought everybody else my age was doing."" Ms. Fowler worked as a stable hand and a nanny to help support her family. ""And I would tell myself, in the times when I would be really, really sad, 'Once I get out of here, I'm going to do something great.' And I would just pray at night, like, 'God, please just let me get out, give me opportunities to get out. I promise I'll do good with it.'"" At 16, she began ""freaking out"" about her future. ""I had this really intense resolve. I would call universities and community colleges and say, 'I really want to go to college? How do I get to college. What do I do?' And they would say, 'You have to get an application. You have to get letters of recommendation.' It was terrifying. I had no idea what I was doing."" She figured out how to take the SAT and ACT. She made a list of all the books she had read and at the top wrote, ""Susan Fowler's Home School"" and sent it off to Arizona State University.

She applied to the top 10 colleges as a transfer student and was accepted at the University of Pennsylvania, where she was told she could study physics and given help with the steep tuition. After a rough first semester, advisers tried to steer her away from physics. So she walked into the office of Penn's president, Amy Gutmann, and left a message with her assistant: In a commencement speech, Ms. Gutmann had said that the school would help students fulfill their dreams. ""I heard back directly from the president herself, and she was like, 'You are right. This is a place for people to fulfill their dreams.'"" She told Ms. Fowler she could get back to her whiteboards, and after that, it was ""fantastic."" The essay that shook Silicon Valley was called ""Reflecting on One Very, Very Strange Year at Uber,"" and Ms. Fowler began by noting that it was ""a strange, fascinating, and slightly horrifying story."" Published on Feb. 19, it rocked the world's most valuable start-up, challenging the mantra that great disrupters are above the law. The blog post was notable for its dispassionate tone, as the young engineer who had left the company after a year walked the reader through everything that had gone very, very wrong in the brozilla culture of kegs, sexual coarseness and snaky competition.

Ms. Fowler was on her first day with her new engineering team when her manager sent her a string of messages over the company chat system. ""He's telling me that he's in an open relationship and that his girlfriend is getting laid all the time, but he just can't because he's at work all the time,"" she says, reprising her blog post with me. ""And he's trying really hard not to get in trouble at work, but he's really looking for a woman to have sex with. And I was like, 'What the hell? This can't be real. How stupid does he have to be?' But it turned out he'd been getting away with this for so long, he didn't care anymore. And I feel like so many of these men, they believe that the only reason women get into these jobs is to get a guy."" Ms. Fowler took screen shots and reported the manager to human resources, thinking, ""They'll do the right thing."" But they didn't, explaining that the manager was ""a high performer"" and it was his first offense, something Ms. Fowler later discovered to be untrue. ""Somehow I'm supposed to be like, 'Oh, he's a high performer? Never mind. How dare I?'"" she says, laughing. She wrote that H.R. told her she could either find another team to work on or stay on that man's team and expect a poor performance review. Another manager told her that if she reported stuff to H.R., he could fire her. Amid the manic, sexist behavior, the number of female engineers in the division Ms. Fowler was part of dwindled to less than 6 percent -- too few, the company said, to merit ordering them the same black leather jackets they were ordering for the men. When Ms. Fowler earned some money from ""Production-Ready Microservices,"" a book on engineering she wrote, she went out to Madewell and bought herself a black leather jacket.

""I didn't really care if they branded me a troublemaker,"" she says, ""because I hadn't gotten that far in my life and overcome all these things to get treated inappropriately. I wasn't going to take it. I'd worked so hard. I deserved so much better. And I was, like, 'No. That's not O.K. You don't get to do that.'"" In her memo, she says, ""I knew I had to be super-careful about how I said it if I wanted anybody to take it seriously. A lot of women have been whistle-blowers in the past, and a lot of them have just gotten torn down and treated terribly. One of the things that kept popping up was this idea that if you do whistle-blow about sexual harassment, then that is what will define the rest of your life. And I kind of struggled with this. But then, to me, I realized, you know what? No. Stepping back, just being in my little Stoicism Susan bubble, if what people know you for is bringing light to an issue about bad behavior, about bad stuff going on and laws not being followed and people being treated inappropriately, why wouldn't I want that? That's a badge of honor. ""And I wasn't just standing up for myself. I felt like I was standing up for everyone else that I was seeing at Uber who was mistreated. It was an extremely demoralizing environment. I would see people who would get harassed or made fun of or bullied and they would go report it, and they would just get ground down by upper management and H.R. And so I felt like, if I can take this on despite the consequences, then I should do it."" Like women in Hollywood I talked to after the Weinstein collapse, Ms. Fowler thought the new outspokenness in Silicon Valley on sexual harassment may have been spurred by the election of President Trump. ""The second Trump won, I felt super-powerless and I thought, 'Oh my God, no one's looking out for us,'"" she says. ""They have the House, they have the Senate, they have the White House. And so we have to take it back ourselves. We have to be the ones doing the work."" The only woman on the board then, Arianna Huffington, who had vowed that the culture of ""brilliant jerks"" must end, had been trying to help Mr. Kalanick by advising him to sleep more and meditate. But he caused another kerfuffle when he chose to meditate in the lactation room.

When Ms. Fowler's memo exploded, Ms. Huffington oversaw the investigation by Eric Holder, reached out and talked to employees, and said she wanted to ""hold the leadership team's feet to the fire."" Uber later fired 20 people, including senior executives. ""So I was disappointed in her because I expected her to be an advocate,"" Ms. Fowler says, noting that Ms. Huffington appeared on TV after the blog post to insist that there's no ""systemic problem"" at Uber. ""I had two friends who went to her and Liane Hornsey, who's the head of H.R., and reported various harassment discrimination,"" Ms. Fowler says. ""And then I was told that many other women were doing the same thing. And then Arianna went on TV that same week and said, there's no 'systemic problem.' Which I was like, 'No, a whole bunch of people just went to you this week.'"" Ms. Fowler adds that the company's C.T.O., Thuan Pham, who knew about her complaints, is still in the same job. Ms. Huffington told me that she agreed that the problem was ""systemic sexism,"" but that she did not believe there was ""systemic sexual harassment."" But, she added, ""there should be zero tolerance for even one case of sexual harassment."" ""I was totally supportive of having a full investigation of her claims,"" Ms. Huffington says. ""That's why we brought in a former attorney general to investigate. I don't think you can do a lot more than that.""

On the advice of a friend, Ms. Fowler got private security for the first few weeks after she published her incendiary essay. She thinks Silicon Valley needs to get rid of forced arbitration. ""When you join these companies, they make you sign away your constitutional right to sue,"" she says. Ms. Fowler has taken that to the Supreme Court, and as is her wont, is studying the syllabuses of Columbia Law School so she can learn more about her rights. She now has a job at Stripe as the editor of its tech publication. And she's working with Verve, a Hollywood talent agency, developing a movie based on her experiences, described by the agency to me as ""Erin Brockovich"" meets ""The Social Network."" Meanwhile, Ms. Fowler is still reading the Stoics (while Mr. Kalanick is still wrestling with the board about who should control the company he started). ""I think, right now especially, with Trump in the White House, who knows what's going on with North Korea? Then we have natural disasters happening. It just feels like you're being tossed around on the ocean and there's nothing. What I keep going back to and what keeps me going, is trying to do good in whatever little spot of the world we can influence, no matter how small."" As we leave, I ask Ms. Fowler if she knows the baby's sex. ""A girl,"" she says, smiling radiantly. ""I'm so excited. Now I'm just like, 'Got to make this world better so she doesn't have to deal with these things.'"" Susan Fowler submits to a round of Confirm or Deny, here.","In her first interview since the essay that started a wave of sexual-harassment revelations, Susan Fowler tells her life story and looks to the future.",dd0f4f00-e12d-5fab-9d6b-f0bf27d0d7da,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/31/fashion/22WITH/22WITH-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=2d0b516b9cff53589dce7fcb855588b14a247af077a47ffe673127cc90fb005b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Susan Fowler describes herself as &ldquo;an amateur myrmecologist.&rdquo;,dd0f4f00-e12d-5fab-9d6b-f0bf27d0d7da,N24News/imgs/dd0f4f00-e12d-5fab-9d6b-f0bf27d0d7da.jpg,15
Books,"In This Thriller, an Israeli Doctor Can't Escape His Irresponsibility",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/books/review/waking-lions-ayelet-gundar-goshen.html,"Eitan Green, the protagonist of the Israeli author 's novel ""Waking Lions,"" is a respected neurosurgeon who has been forced by a professional dispute to relocate from Tel Aviv to Beersheba, a desert town where dust is everywhere, ""a thin white layer, like the icing on a birthday cake no one wants."" Speeding through a remote area in his S.U.V. late one night, he hits an Eritrean man walking by the roadside. And when he decides that the victim is beyond help, he impulsively flees the scene.

The next morning, the victim's widow shows up at Eitan's doorstep, holding his wallet and demanding not his money but his expertise. Soon she has blackmailed him into treating illegal immigrants from the northeast of Africa at an abandoned garage that has been turned into an underground hospital. The novel that follows -- part psychological thriller, part morality play -- takes readers through the wilderness of the Negev desert and its underworld of Israeli drug dealers, Bedouin gangs and desperate refugees.

Gundar-Goshen has said that she believes the writer's job is to force readers to look at what they'd usually avoid. Not short on discomfiting scenes, ""Waking Lions"" offers a commentary on privilege and otherness, challenging readers to confront their own blind spots and preconceptions. The themes of visibility and invisibility, of the power dynamics between the observed and the observer, run throughout the narrative. Although the victim's widow, Sirkit, who scrubs floors at a gas station restaurant, often goes unnoticed by Israelis, she is a beautiful woman, and thus used to the male gaze. She knows that ""men can fasten their eyes on you the way people put a collar on a dog."" As the lone witness to Eitan's crime, she has become ""the only one who knew him for what he was."" The authority she holds over him both infuriates and intrigues him. The intimacy that emerges between them is rendered with a restrained intensity that creates some of the novel's most dramatic scenes.","In Ayelet Gundar-Goshen's thriller, ""Waking Lions,"" an Israeli doctor pays big-time for a clandestine crime.",1a10aee3-98ae-5aa9-b997-e2ed5bebabad,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/19/books/review/19Tsabari/19Tsabari-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=42d64681d1b768ad0f034d1c3e9a03d2ccd6dfd5bd42a6d340ac5fb4f0b0932c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Ayelet Gundar-Goshen,1a10aee3-98ae-5aa9-b997-e2ed5bebabad,N24News/imgs/1a10aee3-98ae-5aa9-b997-e2ed5bebabad.jpg,13
Technology,Big Tech Companies Meeting With U.S. Officials on 2020 Election Security,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/technology/2020-election-facebook-google.html,"The meeting, nearly 14 months ahead of Election Day, illustrates how tech companies are preparing for the 2020 race after Russian operatives used Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other platforms to spread disinformation and sow discord in 2016. Since then, many of the tech companies have been under scrutiny. Some have said they can do better and have made internal changes to reduce disinformation and foreign interference.

In May 2018, for instance, many of the same tech companies met at Facebook headquarters to discuss ways they could collaborate before the midterm elections that year. Tech companies and the federal government have gone to greater lengths to cooperate on threat modeling, intelligence sharing and building stronger ties between the public and private sector agencies, said a person briefed on the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the information was confidential.

The companies have also tried other tactics to get a handle on how their platforms and products can be misused in elections. Facebook has tried to monitor and ward off threats to elections in many countries beyond the United States, including Brazil, Mexico, Germany and France. Last week, for example, the social network said it was strengthening how it verified which groups and people place political advertising on its site. And Twitter said last month that it would bar state-backed media from promoting tweets on its service.

Bloomberg earlier reported Wednesday's meeting between the tech companies and government officials.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment about the meeting. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the F.B.I. confirmed they attended. An F.B.I. official said the agency was invited by the tech companies to ""discuss our shared goal of protecting democracy and securing the 2020 U.S. state, federal and presidential elections.""

A Twitter spokeswoman called the meeting ""a joint effort in response to a shared threat, and we are committed to doing our part."" A spokeswoman for Microsoft confirmed the company participated in the meeting, as did a spokeswoman for Google.","Security teams from Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft met with members of the F.B.I., Department of Homeland Security and others on Wednesday.",a1731eaa-256b-5b54-8caa-c7b6e6a5521c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/04/business/04electiontech/04electiontech-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=4ba6b96ba6635cd11776d8745a6ff6eb046137c062cb634f4038e844beb45e48&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Facebook's election ""War Room,"" at its headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.",a1731eaa-256b-5b54-8caa-c7b6e6a5521c,N24News/imgs/a1731eaa-256b-5b54-8caa-c7b6e6a5521c.jpg,20
Style,Ann Demeulemeester Doesn't Miss Fashion at All. She Has Other Plans.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/style/ann-demeulemeester-doesnt-miss-fashion-at-all-she-has-other-plans.html,"KESSEL, Belgium -- Six years ago, when Ann Demeulemeester walked away from the fashion label she founded in 1985 -- a house known for an ethereal, monochromatic aesthetic embodied by nymph-like models with penetrating stares and dark brows -- speculation ensued. What would she do next? Could the label, which she had so carefully cultivated to be the visual incarnation of a Patti Smith lyric, really go on without her? It is not unusual for designers to step away from fashion -- some burn too bright, crashing out broke or exhausted -- but Ms. Demeulemeester's case was unusual. She left something that was still succeeding -- handing creative control to Sebastien Meunier -- seemingly for no pressing reason other than urge. It turns out, though, that she was not done with designing. She was simply looking for a new language. ""I wanted to leave myself time to try another kind of life,"" she said. ""I wanted to be vulnerable again. To be starting out, finding something difficult.""

She has landed on a new medium, and Ann Demeulemeester Serax, a collection of porcelain dinner services, silverware, glasses and, in the near future, larger housewares, will be available in October. It was all conceived by Ms. Demeulemeester and her husband, Patrick Robyn, a former photographer and her long-term collaborator. For years, Ms. Demeulemeester, 59 , lived in central Antwerp, in the only surviving Le Corbusier building in Belgium . (During her final year in college, she produced a fashion collection inspired by Modernism, and Mr. Robyn thought they should photograph it in a complementary setting, so they tried to contact the building's owner. A few years later, after a slight miscommunication over their intentions, they ended up buying it, cobbling the money together from relatives.)

Now, country life defines her day. To be specific: a house in Kessel, a small town where, at one time, most residents were employed in diamond cutting. It is about 45 minutes from Antwerp, by car, and just shy of an hour from Brussels. ""It's really in the middle of nowhere,"" Ms. Demeulemeester said. The house, from the outside, is imposing: giant, square, Palladian. It was built in 1864 on the instruction of a woman who had fallen in love with an Italian man and hoped to entice him with a house modeled on a Lake Como residence. (Her plan failed.)

Inside, it's cozier. There is well-worn midcentury furniture, a stuffed horse's head with an added horn to suggest a unicorn (""Are you a princess?"" children ask Ms. Demeulemeester when they visit) and an abundance of lamps. At the end of the grounds, a river flows, which, if followed for a little over three miles , leads to the country house of her fellow Belgian designer Dries Van Noten. He and Ms. Demeulemeester were members of the Antwerp Six, a cluster of talented students who graduated from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp in 1980 and 1981 and quickly put Belgium, previously unremarkable for its fashion, on the map. Today she and Mr. Van Noten often compare garden notes. Hers is 50 acres and includes Shamo chickens, which she recently bought for Mr. Robyn. There is also a small bathing pond, in which she takes a midafternoon dip, and a thriving vegetable patch. IN KESSEL, Ms. Demeulemeester has come to respect the relentlessness and unpredictability of tending to nature. She likes how slow the process is, the fact that validation takes years. She insisted that a reporter smell her favorite tree, a rhododendron. ""You have to be strong,"" she said. ""There can be a storm, and suddenly something you love dies. You have to learn to start again. I learnt that if an old tree goes away, another one will grow. A small one will take the place, in the light that becomes available.""

Part of the appeal of porcelain was having suitable homes for her carefully harvested fruit and vegetables. Her husband suggested building a little atelier downstairs. There, clad in a white lab coat, Ms. Demeulemeester worked away for five years, slowing learning new techniques. ""I had to learn to be so patient, to wait days until things dried, to wait while it baked, to accept that it may break and I'd have to start again,"" she said. ""It was the opposite of fashion."" She found it relaxing but would often find herself working into the night. ""I always loved to sculpt,"" she said. ""My clothes were always about shape. That's why they were always black and white. I felt much more like an architect than a decorator."" MS. DEMEULEMEESTER attended porcelain master classes in England and France. She employed tutors. She went to Germany to see traditional manufacturers. She taught herself to make molds. She tested endless glazes. (Forty squares of porcelain, each a different, barely distinguishable shade of white, sit lined up by the atelier window.) She invested in an enormous German kiln by Rohde, which came only in bright turquoise. ( ""It's a horrible color,"" she said.) ""I wanted to know how to do it all,"" she said, surveying shelf upon shelf of her creations.

Fittingly, her home came with its own chapel upstairs, a round room decorated with ornate frescoes, which today contains a record player and a couch. So perfect are the acoustics that sometimes the local choir asks if they can borrow it to rehearse. At the intimate dinner parties (fish suppers for between four and six) that Ms. Demeulemeester enjoys hosting, she began to introduce her handiwork. ""I loved to always put a new plate on the table,"" she said. ""Look what I made!"" Sometimes guests asked to buy them. ""It's amazing,"" she said. ""It's like seeing your first collection, only it's not clothes."" ""'But it's so Ann!'"" she recalled her guests saying. One business-savvy guest suggested she meet Axel Van Den Bossche, a founder of Serax, the housewares manufacturer. On visiting her ""castle,"" as he calls it, Mr. Van Den Bossche was struck.

THEY SPENT A YEAR working out how to produce the Serax collection. Much of the complexity came from the demands of Ms. Demeulemeester's unrelenting eye. ""I said to him in advance, 'Are you sure you want to do this? Because I'm a perfectionist,'"" she said. ""It's my best and worst element."" It was an ""emotional"" process, Mr. Van Den Bossche said. ""I've worked with several well-known designers, and I've never seen anyone like this, who goes into the detail like this."" At one point, no one could be found to adequately reproduce the hand-painting. In the end, they settled on a studio of porcelain experts in China who received regular WhatsApp videos of Ms. Demeulemeester painting.

Health,Rule Shift on Birth Control Is Concession to Obama Allies,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/11/health/policy/obama-to-offer-accommodation-on-birth-control-rule-officials-say.html,"WASHINGTON -- For the White House, the decision announced Friday to soften a rule requiring religious-affiliated organizations to pay for insurance plans that offer free birth control was never really driven by a desire to mollify Roman Catholic bishops, who were strongly opposed to the plan. Rather, the fight was for Sister Carol Keehan -- head of an influential Catholic hospital group, who had supported President Obama's health care law -- and Catholic allies of the White House seen as the religious left. Sister Keehan had told the White House that the new rule, part of the health care law, went too far. ""I felt like he had made a really bad decision, and I told him that,"" Sister Keehan said of the president. ""I told his staff that. I felt like they had made a bad decision on principle, and politically it was a bad decision. For me another key thing was that it had the potential to threaten the future of health reform."" Mr. Obama announced that rather than requiring religiously affiliated charities and universities to pay for contraceptives for their employees, the cost would be shifted to health insurance companies. The initial rule caused a political uproar among some Catholics and others who portrayed it as an attack on religious freedom.

Meeting with his top advisers in the Oval Office last week amid rising anger from Catholic Democrats, liberal columnists and left-leaning religious leaders -- a fed-up Mr. Obama issued an order meant for Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services. Ms. Sebelius and agency lawyers had initially told the president they needed a year to work out a compromise that had seemed obvious to some in the administration from the start: make the new rule more like that offered by the State of Hawaii, where employees of religiously affiliated institutions obtained contraceptives through a side benefit offered by insurance companies. But in difficult internal negotiations, a group of advisers had bested Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and others and sold the president on a stricter rule. Now the political furor surrounding it was threatening to consume signs of economic improvement giving a boost to the White House and put the Obama re-election campaign on the defensive. Time was up, Mr. Obama told his advisers, according to officials in the meeting. Ms. Sebelius, a Catholic who, along with the president's senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and domestic policy adviser Melody Barnes, had pushed hard for the new rule, was not there, but the message came through: Figure out a way to make something like the Hawaii model work. In announcing the shift on Friday, Mr. Obama sought to quell the brewing rebellion. Not unexpectedly, the Catholic bishops issued a statement renewing their call for ""legislative action on religious liberty,"" and calling rescission of the mandate the ""only complete solution."" And Speaker John A. Boehner's spokesman on Friday promised that House Republicans ""will continue to work toward a legislative solution.""

Tim Kaine, a Virginia Senate candidate and former head of the Democratic National Committee, echoed the concern of Sister Keehan, president of the Catholic Health Association, that it went too far. So did some liberal-leaning Catholics in the news media, like Chris Matthews of MSNBC's ""Hardball,"" who called the rule ""frightening,"" and E. J. Dionne, the Washington Post columnist, who wrote that Mr. Obama had ""utterly botched"" the issue. Meanwhile, Sister Simone Campbell, executive director of Network, a group founded by nuns decades ago to lobby on social justice issues, warned White House officials that nearly 500 Catholic activists would be in Washington this weekend for a conference, and that if no compromise had been reached by then, all of them would return to their parishes fired up about the contraception mandate. ""We were getting killed,"" one administration official said Friday. The White House picked the deputy chief of staff Nancy-Ann DeParle to talk to Sister Keehan about ways the rule could be made palatable. Meanwhile, administration officials were hearing from women's rights organizations, particularly Planned Parenthood, who warned that they would oppose any compromise that made employees pick up the tab. ""After the many genuine concerns that have been raised over the last few weeks, as well as, frankly, the more cynical desire on the part of some to make this into a political football, it became clear that spending months hammering out a solution was not going to be an option,"" Mr. Obama said on Friday. Some who favor the compromise wonder why it took so long. ""What has happened a few times in this administration is that they get so focused on the substantive policy, they get kind of narrowly focused and lose sight of the countervailing concerns,"" Sister Campbell said. At the White House, the internal debate had raged since last fall, when administration officials started looking at how to put the rule into practice. All agreed early on that churches would be exempt. The question revolved around colleges, charities and other religiously affiliated institutions that employed people of different faiths.

Archbishop Timothy M. Dolan of New York met with Mr. Obama and argued in favor of a broad exemption. Shortly after, Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, and other proponents of the rule began a series of meetings with officials to argue against an exemption for religiously affiliated institutions. Throughout that debate, administration officials said, Mr. Obama pushed hard for a version of the Hawaii rule. But Ms. Sebelius and others at the Department of Health and Human Services said it would take time to resolve whether the administration could emulate that approach. In the end, with the State of the Union address imminent and time passing to work out the new rules governing the carrying out of the health care law, the administration announced on Jan. 20 that religious-affiliated institutions -- but not churches -- would have to offer the insurance. ""All hell broke loose,"" one administration official said, leading to Mr. Obama's sharp orders in the Oval Office last week. The result differs from Hawaii in that it shifts the cost to insurers, instead of employees. It also differs from Hawaii in that it requires companies -- and not the religious institutions -- to inform employees about how to arrange coverage. Before making his announcement, Mr. Obama on Friday called three people: Sister Keehan, Ms. Richards and Archbishop Dolan. From Sister Keehan and Ms. Richards, he got unqualified endorsements. Even the archbishop offered, initially, a grudging acknowledgment that it was ""a first step in the right direction"" -- although the bishops later said that Mr. Obama's fix ""raises serious moral concerns.""",The decision to soften a requirement that religious-affiliated organizations pay for insurance plans offering free birth control was meant to appease Catholics on the left — not bishops.,10ce709c-c22b-5a76-a1a2-2479e9b7cb2d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/02/11/us/politics/11obama2/11obama2-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=350&w=600&s=3313ed96ef55d7f80c279a81f0f09335a837b33f7d349d7e0a0fe0e5009efd43&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"President Obama offered ""accommodations"" to religious institutions on the new health insurance rule Friday, with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, left.",10ce709c-c22b-5a76-a1a2-2479e9b7cb2d,N24News/imgs/10ce709c-c22b-5a76-a1a2-2479e9b7cb2d.jpg,1
Theater,'Safeword' Review: The Bondage Play (Hold the Pleasure),https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/theater/safeword-review.html,"The plays of S. Asher Gelman try to fill the void in popular culture once occupied on TV by the likes of ""Queer as Folk"" and ""The L Word"" -- shows that promised titillation about L.G.B.T. life but also educated audiences.

In his first professional play, ""Afterglow,"" two men in an open marriage invite a young massage therapist into their bed and lives. The frank depiction of sex and the chiseled actors' nudity turned the play into a sleeper hit. It ran Off Broadway for more than a year and even once hosted a nude audience night, during which patrons were invited to disrobe emotionally and physically.

Mr. Gelman's second play, ""Safeword,"" is hoping to do for bondage what ""Afterglow"" did for open marriage. But here, the characters are unfinished, and overall the play promises more than it can deliver.

Music,Star Flutist Settles Pay Equity Suit Against Boston Symphony,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/arts/music/boston-symphony-elizabeth-rowe-settlement.html,"Elizabeth Rowe, the principal flutist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, has settled her pay discrimination lawsuit against the ensemble, bringing to an end a case that sparked international conversation about gender bias in classical music.

Ms. Rowe, who joined the orchestra in 2004, had sought more than $200,000 in unpaid wages. The amount of the settlement, which was reached on Feb. 14, was not disclosed.

Opinion,"Well Played, Bernie Sanders",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/opinion/bernie-sanders-biden-campaign.html,"It is time to bid a gentle and grateful farewell to Bernie Sanders's quest for the presidency.

On Tuesday, even as the coronavirus pandemic roiled the primaries and kept some voters away from the polls, Joe Biden swept to victory in three states -- Illinois, Arizona and Florida. The results were not close. In Florida, with 219 delegates on the line, Mr. Biden bested Mr. Sanders by some 40 points, winning every county in the state. In Illinois, with its 155 delegates, his margin of victory topped 20 points.

The harder you look at the math and at the voting coalition that Mr. Biden has put together, the harder it is to see a way for Mr. Sanders to make a comeback. On Wednesday morning, his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, announced that the candidate would be ""having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign.""

Such conversations are tough for any candidate. For Mr. Sanders, who has inspired a passionate following with his image as an unbending fighter, dropping out would be all the more excruciating. Even as his electoral prospects have dimmed, many of his supporters have urged him to stay in the race -- to keep his ideological vision and his revolution alive.

If anything, they see the coronavirus crisis, and the economic havoc it is wreaking, as an argument to keep Mr. Sanders's voice front and center, arguing for the interests of the people over the powerful. And with a growing number of states postponing voting out of health concerns, some of Mr. Sanders's allies see an opening to keep the cause alive a bit longer. Mr. Shakir suggested that a decision about dropping out was not imminent, noting that ""the next primary contest is at least three weeks away.""","But for the sake of the Democratic Party and the nation, it's time to step aside and join forces with Joe Biden.",50bd6d77-f562-5252-b5b2-ee002de3e31d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/18/opinion/18cottleWeb/18cottleWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=bccb675e917b93c65b08ad5c3f850a9b460dc9669641e32687e30bcd1b6c895d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Bernie Sanders fought the good fight.,50bd6d77-f562-5252-b5b2-ee002de3e31d,N24News/imgs/50bd6d77-f562-5252-b5b2-ee002de3e31d.jpg,11
Automobiles,Lost Key? Copies From the Cloud,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/automobiles/lost-key-copies-from-the-cloud.html,"When Greg Marsh moved to New York three years ago, he discovered that his girlfriend often lost her keys and he had to spend hundreds of dollars changing the locks on their apartment. So Mr. Marsh founded KeyMe, a service that lets customers store digital copies of their keys, order them from a computer or iPhone and have them sent to their home or office. Or the keys can be made instantly at retail kiosks in the New York City area. In just a year, KeyMe has stored hundreds of thousands of keys on its cloud servers, saving customers an expensive call to a locksmith or hours waiting for a roommate or spouse to return home with a spare key. Now KeyMe is applying its technology to produce car keys, which are far more expensive and often require a trip to an auto dealer. In the coming weeks, 100 second-generation kiosks, which can scan auto keys, will be installed in 7-Elevens and other retail stores across the country.

KeyMe will produce only mechanical keys or those with transponder chips -- not electronic fobs for remote locking or keyless ignition switches. The car keys must be delivered by mail, not produced on the spot at a kiosk. ""As soon as we launched the first-generation machine a year ago, there were lots of people putting car keys into the machine, but we didn't support it,"" Mr. Marsh said as he demonstrated a new kiosk at a 7-Eleven in Manhattan. ""Car keys are really hard to get. You have to go to dealers, and they're expensive."" To thwart thieves, automakers have been making increasingly sophisticated keys. Most are two-sided and many have no saw-tooth edges. Keys to newer cars also have an encrypted transponder that sends an electronic signal permitting the car to be started. But the more complex keys are more expensive. KeyMe charges $20 for a copy of a mechanical key and $65 for a key with a transponder, which Mr. Marsh said was less than half the price at an auto dealer or locksmith. Customers who store keys on KeyMe's servers avoid having to tow their car to a dealer. ""It sounds like it has potential for some people, and certainly the cost is competitive as well as the convenience of knowing you can get one in a few days,"" Jim Travers, the associate editor for automobiles at Consumer Reports, said of KeyMe. But Mr. Travers and other experts expressed concern about the security of KeyMe's servers. Mr. Marsh said KeyMe erased all billing and financial data immediately after keys were shipped. Customers who use KeyMe's mobile app must scan both sides of their keys laid on white paper to prevent thieves from secretly taking a picture of a key with a cellphone. Customers who use KeyMe's kiosks log in with their email addresses or use a biometric fingerprint reader.

""We want as little information as possible about you,"" Mr. Marsh said. ""In a worst case, if someone hacked our encrypted servers, they'll see geometric numbers that represent the shapes of keys, not credit card information or addresses."" The service is simple to use. At a kiosk, customers insert their car key into a universal keyhole. On a touch screen, they choose the car's make, model and year. Their key is then scanned and stored without charge. Copies can be ordered on the spot using a credit card or cash. An email is sent to the customer, who provides a shipping address. KeyMe is not the only alternative to a car dealer. Pop-a-Lock, a chain of franchised locksmiths, will send a locksmith to your car and make a copy. Pop-a-Lock's locksmiths can also reproduce fobs for keyless ignitions. ""If it's not time-sensitive and not a high-security key, there are some usages for KeyMe,"" said Don Marks, Pop-a-Lock's chief executive. ""We're in the business of urgent need and high-security keys."" Dealers, too, say they can better ensure that keys are copied and programmed properly. ""If you're talking about a straight mechanical tooth key, that's fine, but when you have a chip embedded in a key, it gets kind of tricky,"" said Mark Schienberg of the Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association. Still, for drivers who want a spare in case they lose a key, or need one in days and not hours, KeyMe may provide a cheaper alternative to driving to a dealer. ""If you're thoughtful enough to have stored your key, all you have to do is to go to 7-Eleven and get a copy,"" said Raja Doddala, senior director for new ventures at 7-Eleven, which has a minority stake in KeyMe.",A company is placing kiosks in New York-area 7-Eleven stores that will let people make car keys without having to go to a dealership.,b1171d90-ae85-54c6-ac5e-47760949cf0b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/16/automobiles/KEYS/KEYS-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=709&w=600&s=2949d067082e9bda6c00b40c545e8967fb46a205d6291620ae8941a14b8a53b5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Greg Marsh, the founder of KeyMe, at one of his company's key-copying kiosks in a 7-Eleven store on the Bowery.",b1171d90-ae85-54c6-ac5e-47760949cf0b,N24News/imgs/b1171d90-ae85-54c6-ac5e-47760949cf0b.jpg,23
Science,What We Finally Got Around to Learning at the Procrastination Research Conference,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/21/science/procrastination-research-conference.html,"""In the end time is going to kill us. The only thing that limits us is time. You can get another job or lover. But you can't get more time,"" said Jean O'Callaghan of University of Roehampton in London, regarding why she studies procrastination.

What We Finally Got Around to Learning at the Procrastination Research Conference

CHICAGO -- The shuttle driver got lost on the way to the 10th Procrastination Research Conference, threatening to derail the schedule. Still by 9:20 a.m. last Thursday, the 60 or so attendees had already completed check-in at DePaul University, welcome remarks and the first of dozens of presentations. As they filed toward the coffee, their badges flashed their countries of origin -- Germany, Turkey, Peru, India, Israel and Australia, among others. ""I remember when I couldn't get anyone to talk about procrastination. Look at us now,"" said Joseph R. Ferrari, a professor of psychology at DePaul and this year's conference chairman, who has published four books on procrastination. For the last 20 years, Dr. Ferrari and his colleagues have worked to create what attendees described as a much-needed setting for sharing and debating their research, without being made fun of.

It is a conference built on the idea that precisely because procrastination is problematic for so many people, it is worthy of serious investigation. Throughout the morning, Dr. Ferrari's wife, Sharon, stood by the registration table, prepared to morph from greeter to guard if anyone tried to violate one of the meeting's core rules: ""There's no day-of registration,"" she said. Here is what we learned about who procrastinates, where they procrastinate and how to halt the loop of perpetual delay. Part of the challenge of studying procrastination is defining it. Dr. Ferrrari, the conference organizer, defines procrastination as ""the purposive and frequent delay in beginning or completing a task to the point of experiencing subjective discomfort, such as anxiety or regret."" His colleague Dr. Anderson says it is ""culpably unwarranted delay."" At the simplest level, most researchers agree, you know it when you're doing it.

One out of five people, researchers have found, fall into a category they call chronic procrastinators or procs (rhymes with crocs). The proc consistently procrastinates in multiple areas of his or her life -- work, personal, financial, social -- in ways that attendees describe as wreaking havoc, undermining goals and producing perpetual shame. Researchers have built scales to separate the true proc from the occasional procrastinator. They assess not simply how often, but also the severity of consequences with prompts like: # I am continually saying, ""I'll do it tomorrow."" # Putting things off until the last minute has cost me in the past year. It is more complicated than ""if you do it X number of times a week you're a proc."" But if you procrastinate ""almost every day, at least half of the time you have work tasks,"" that is a solid hint that you qualify, said Julia Elen Haferkamp, a psychologist at the University of Munster in Germany. ""When it's really procrastination, it's more like a psychological disease,"" said her colleague Stephan Forster, also a psychologist at the University of Munster. He, and others who treat procs, spoke of broken marriages, lost jobs, deflated dreams, financial disarray and self-esteem issues.

But if 20 percent of the population procrastinates that much, is it definitely bad? One presenter, Jean O'Callaghan, a principal lecturer at the University of Roehampton in London, offered a more positive interpretation of this group, framing them as masters of idleness. ""Maybe cultures need to learn how to do time differently and we can learn from procrastinators,"" said Dr. O'Callaghan, who was the chairwoman of the 2005 conference. ""To think out of the box about time and what it means to have a meaningful life? To have satisfaction? To have a sense of well-being? Or to produce a thousand articles?"" But Dr. Ferrari, who has published more research articles on procrastination than anyone else in psychology, does not agree that there is any upside to procrastination. (He has even published a few studies that work toward counteracting what he calls the ""myth"" that procrastinators perform better under last-minute pressure.)

Where is the proc capital of the world? Pointing to a slide featuring Poland, Britain, Turkey and Austria, Bilge Uzun, a research scientist at Bahcesehir University in Istanbul, asked, ""Where do you think we find the most procrastinators?"" It was a trick question. She and her co-authors found that all countries surveyed had the same percentage: 20 percent. It's a finding reinforced by dozens of other studies over the years in Saudi Arabia, Germany, Japan and beyond. And yet when Karem Diaz Cerna, a psychology professor at Pontifical Catholic University in Lima, surveyed her fellow Peruvians, she was convinced she was going to find an outlier.

""We thought, everything was so late there so the scales were not going to work,"" she recounted. But using a comparable questionnaire she also got about 20. Not just in Lima, the capital, but in all regions surveyed. When Bill McCown, a research psychologist and associate dean at the University of Louisiana at Monroe, attended the first procrastination conference in 1997, there were some peculiar ideas floating around about procrastination. ""At the time, it's just due to the American lifestyle and capitalism. That was one big one,"" he recalled.

The presentations at the conference showed that the field has come a long way, but there was plenty of work to be done. Asked to summarize their advice to the procs of the world, most attendees offered a version of the following: Accept that changing will require learning to manage your thoughts and emotions more than figuring out how to manage your time. If it is a severe problem, consider working with a professional who understands procrastination. And for those who have A.D.H.D., the cycle of procrastination may operate differently than for those who do not. But what does the research say? ""Mostly that we need more consistent research,"" said Wendelien Van Eerde, a professor at the faculty of economics and business at the University of Amsterdam, and a co-author of a meta-analysis of studies on interventions for procrastination.

At first, it seemed that this year's decision would be a breeze. There were offers to host from Israel, Turkey and Britain. But wait, some crucial people were missing. Maybe it would be better to figure it out over email? Someone suggested a ""steering committee."" Another advocated for a ""neutral third party"" The shuttles were waiting. No consensus emerged. Just this once, it would have to wait. ""Oh, that's not procrastination,"" Dr. Ferrari said later. Based on his scientific definition, it counted only as ""delay.""","For the last 20 years, academic researchers have gathered at this event to share and debate their studies without being mocked.",e508f5d2-f94f-5135-bf44-e11ba7d93ce0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/20/science/20procrastinationc/20procrastinationc-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=2062c646f3b1402c1147f6692906558040899984082595cb8e8d30cb74ad57cf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The 60 or so attendees at this year's conference traveled from across the world to discuss the latest research on procrastination.,e508f5d2-f94f-5135-bf44-e11ba7d93ce0,N24News/imgs/e508f5d2-f94f-5135-bf44-e11ba7d93ce0.jpg,2
Music,Ranveer Singh Champions Indian Rap. 'Gully Boy' Provided a Spark.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/arts/music/ranveer-singh-indian-rap.html,"The year was 1995. The song was Tupac Shakur 's ""California Love."" When a 10-year-old Ranveer Singh heard the track in his hometown, Mumbai, he felt the music touch a part of him he didn't know existed. He raced to look up the lyrics, and needed to read them only once to commit them to memory. ""I was lured by the language,"" Singh, now 34 and one of India's 10 highest-earning actors, said in a recent interview. ""And although the themes were very mature for me at the time, I feel like I still, even at that age, could recognize that there was something very authentic in the expression."" In the years since Tupac's G-funk single became one of the actor's first hip-hop memories, rap has become a significant part of his life that he's endeavored to integrate into his work. Earlier this year, he starred in ""Gully Boy,"" a film that brought India's burgeoning underground hip-hop scene to the big screen. After its release, he was able to finish a project he'd begun two years before the movie was released: helping found a record label called IncInk dedicated to spotlighting young rappers who reflect the authenticity he has always admired. ""The one thing I love the most about the label is the fact that it's no strings attached,"" Singh said, explaining that the label's concerns aren't with view counts and likes . ""It's no pressure. It's just creating freely. It's unbound.""

""Gully Boy,"" which was inspired by the lives of the Mumbai rappers Divine (Vivian Fernandes) and Naezy (Naved Shaikh) , is India's official entry to the 2020 Academy Awards. Divine and Naezy, known as ""gully"" (street) rappers, have been stalwarts of Indian hip-hop for years, capturing the daily struggles , and giving voice to the frustrations , of the largely underprivileged masses in India. Their raps about class, caste and poverty caught fire around the nation, especially among younger generations. The film brought their work to the mainstream, and with Singh's boost, earned them a wider audience. The film also reflected what's happening in Indian pop culture at large: Rap is gaining steam. In 2018, hip-hop was the fastest-growing genre on the streaming service JioSaavn, according to the platform . Spotify, which was officially introduced in India earlier this year, has also seen demand grow. ""In India, the hip-hop culture is becoming increasingly popular, with 18- to 34-year-olds driving consumption for rap across the country,"" said Amarjit Batra , the managing director of Spotify India. ""Music in Hindi, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu is widely consumed within the genre,"" he said, ""and we see emerging artists who are rapping in languages such as Bhojpuri, Haryanvi, Gujarati, Marathi and Bengali.""

After discovering Tupac, Singh kept other American rappers on a constant loop, including Snoop Dogg, Eminem and the Notorious B.I.G. His personal journey with hip-hop continued through college, into one of his earliest jobs: When he wrote jingles at an advertising firm, he became known for a special skill set. ""There used to be a running joke in the agency that if anyone needed anything to rhyme, like a tagline for a brand or a product, they should go see the rhyme doctor, who was an intern,"" he said. ""Me ."" A few years ago, he met the filmmaker and musician Navzar Eranee when the two collaborated on an ad for the clothing label Jack & Jones. The pair put out an original video featuring a rap by Singh and directed by Eranee . The response was so enthusiastic, the brand eventually did another clip and crowdsourced entries from people who wanted the chance to rap with Singh .

With buzz from ""Gully Boy"" still reverberating a month after its February release, Singh and Navzar launched IncInk. The first three people signed were involved with the film: Kaam Bhaari, Spitfire and SlowCheeta . Kaam Bhaari, whose real name is Kunal Pandagle , grew up in Kandivali East (a suburb of Mumbai) and refers to his humble beginnings frequently in his songs. Singh described the 20-year-old as a surprise package: ""He's diminutive and unassuming, and so when he gets on the mic and starts spitting the kind of venom that he does, it really takes you by storm.""

SlowCheeta , 28, born Chaitnya Sharma , grew up affluent, which Singh said gives him a different perspective as an artist: ""It doesn't mean that they don't suffer from the agony of existence or that they don't have things that they went through in their life that they can express and we maybe can connect with and learn from.""","The actor, who starred in the movie focused on India's underground hip-hop scene, has helped start the record label IncInk.",aa1b334f-f992-5439-ad7e-3af0faf50f7a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/17/arts/17Singh/18Singh-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=9f543a53ec7a5a8d7864018693c10e5dd33095dc6de5014d007a7f882d245ebc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The actor Ranveer Singh has turned his lifelong appreciation of hip-hop into an opportunity to support budding Indian rappers.,aa1b334f-f992-5439-ad7e-3af0faf50f7a,N24News/imgs/aa1b334f-f992-5439-ad7e-3af0faf50f7a.jpg,12
Theater,U.K. National Theater Enters the Streaming Wars,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/theater/national-theatre-uk-streaming-service.html,"LONDON -- Cultural institutions around the world have been pivoting to online this year, and Britain's National Theater has arguably been one of the most successful. From April to July, with its stages shuttered by the coronavirus pandemic and many of its staff furloughed, the theater put recordings of recent hits on YouTube, starting with the wildly popular comedy ""One Man, Two Guvnors."" Those videos got over 15 million views in total. Last week, it also made a recording of its latest production, ""Death of England: Delroy"" -- which closed the night it opened, because of a second national lockdown in England -- available to view free for 24 hours. Now, the theater has decided to change tack. Just days before it reopens for a second time this year with ""Dick Whittington,"" a family Christmas show, it has started its own streaming service -- National Theater at Home -- costing $12.99 plus tax for a monthly subscription, and with a pay-per-view option for individual plays.

The service offers 11 plays at launch on Tuesday, including Michael Longhurst's 2016 production of ""Amadeus,"" telling the story of Mozart's rivalry with Antonio Salieri, and Nicholas Hytner's 2009 production of Racine's ""Phedre"" starring Helen Mirren. There is also a musical for children, ""I Want My Hat Back."" The reason for the new approach was simple, said Rufus Norris, the theater's artistic director, in a telephone interview: money. ""It's not sustainable in the long term to keep it free,"" he said. The National Theater asked for donations when it streamed plays on YouTube, and received about 350,000 pounds, roughly $467,000. That worked out at just a few cents per stream. This wasn't enough for the theater, or the actors, writers and directors involved in the productions, Norris said. ""Obviously our target is people who love theater,"" Norris said, when asked if the service could compete with the likes of Netflix and HBO Max. ""But it'll let other people see the actors they love in a completely different context,"" he added. The initial slate of plays includes performances by Olivia Colman, Tom Hiddleston and Michaela Coel.

Your lockdown streaming efforts were already so successful. Why decide to change approach? The theater's in a perilous situation, like all theaters are over the world, and we're facing some very difficult circumstances due to lockdown coming back, social distancing still going on. So it felt like what we had to do. We've kept the subscription fee as low as we can. But another reason is, this period has been particularly perilous for the artists on whose work we build everything: the actors, writers. And this subscription model means that we can -- to a degree -- make sure that they're benefiting from it. They'll get a share of any income that we make. I understand this has been in the works for months. Has negotiating payments to artists been the biggest challenge? Yes. When we launched on YouTube, it was a very, very quick idea -- just contacting everybody and saying, ""Look, we're closed, is this something we can do for free?"" And everybody immediately piled in and said ""Yes."" But at that stage none of them, and none of us, knew how long this was going to go on for, or that freelance artists would be struggling so much within it. As soon as that became apparent, we immediately started paying fees and back pay for the films we'd put online. This is trying to make that sustainable: We'd love to be able to make our plays free all the time, but that's just not the world that we're in. Musicians with work on streaming services complain they need millions of views to make anywhere near minimum wage. Do you expect a similar response?

They'll all get paid, whatever happens. Do you think there's no alternative for theaters but to go online now? We're in such a fluid situation at the moment, it's really hard to predict what the world's going to be like in one month, let alone six, let alone two years. We'll be keeping a very beady eye on how much demand there is for it. And as we start to return to normal whether there's any measurable negative impact on attendance in our actual theaters, which obviously is completely the opposite of what we intend. The degree theaters have embraced digital during this time, and certainly the audiences have, would suggest the two can happily coexist. I can imagine theater lovers who can afford the fee will love this, but some theaters might think, ""Oh, God, how can I compete against the National with its reputation and star names?"" Is there room for everyone? I just don't know. In the end, there's a huge audience out there with very varied tastes, and there are many initiatives that have found their own market in lockdown. We do bring other theaters on in terms of the work we're doing. This will have on it a show from the Donmar Warehouse, and one from the Young Vic, in London. We're trying to do more. The National in its early days -- the 1960s and 1970s -- had legendary actors like Laurence Olivier performing. Will people eventually see very old grainy footage of them on the site too?","During Britain's lockdown, recorded plays from the archive were free to watch on YouTube.

Movies,'Gloria Bell' Review: Love Is in the Air for a Transcendent Julianne Moore,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/movies/gloria-bell-review.html,"The title character in ""Gloria Bell"" -- played by a transcendent Julianne Moore -- is a restless life force. In most other movies, she might also be a cliche. A middle-aged divorcee, she lives alone in a Los Angeles apartment that doesn't quite feel like a home. Her adult children are off having their own lives; her son has a new baby. Gloria keeps a tidy house, works in insurance, has friends, smokes. She also sings and she dances, moving to pop confections that sound like chapter titles in a wistful romance: ""A Little More Love,"" ""All Out of Love,"" ""No More Lonely Nights."" The Chilean writer-director Sebastian Lelio has told this story before in a somewhat different key. His 2013 movie ""Gloria"" also centers on a divorced middle-aged woman who lives by herself and doesn't like the hairless cat who keeps stealthily invading her place. That Gloria lived (and danced) in Santiago and was played by the superb Paulina Garcia, who, like Moore, inhabits the character so deeply that the performance can feel like a possession. Beat for beat and subtly different line for line, the two movies can seem eerily alike; Lelio has likened ""Gloria Bell"" to a cover version. The redo feels lighter, perhaps because it is unburdened by originality. The first movie was inexorably saturated in the Chilean history that comes with any character who's lived through the Pinochet dictatorship. The new Gloria, by contrast, feels unselfconsciously free of her country's history, its immensity and heaviness, which feels very American. There's music on Gloria's car radio, not news, and the Trump presidency might as well not exist. (The movie was shot in 2017.) It's easy to imagine that Gloria has attended a woman's march or two (if just for the company), but her pastimes skew classic Californian: She takes a yoga class, smokes weed and attends what looks like a laughter therapy session filled with joyous, hands-on communion.

The laughter scene is brief and invitingly enigmatic; Lelio doesn't over-explain his characters, which is very non-American, even in cinema's ostensibly independent registers. The episodic narrative tracks Gloria over a period rived by minor as well as life-altering change. Her daughter (Caren Pistorius) has a new love, and so does Gloria, who shortly after the story opens begins an affair with Arnold (a wonderful John Turturro), a sincere, plodding man with need in his eyes and a girdle cinching his waist. Recently divorced, Arnold has overhauled his life (he had gastric bypass surgery, hence the girdle), and when he and Gloria see each other across the dance floor he comes at her hard. She responds, and they soon become a couple. Lelio conveys the affair beautifully, including in the delicate, fragmented scenes of lovemaking that convey the profundity of desire and its ordinariness. Gloria learns how to shoot a paintball gun at the amusement park that Arnold owns; he meets her friends, and the talk turns to guns. Arnold is a former Marine, a detail that enriches a portrait of a man in permanent crisis, a state of personal emergency that is announced each time he answers a call from his similarly needy adult daughters and former wife.

The ponderous music that blares when Arnold's phone rings is amusing, and then it's abruptly not, having transformed, call after call, into a dirge, a requiem, a discordant family bleat. ""Gloria Bell"" is filled with quicksilver tone shifts. It's often quietly funny and then a little (or very) sad and then funny again. The humor is sometimes as obvious as the hairless cat that looks like a wizened extraterrestrial and the Velcro crackle of a girdle being hastily removed in a dark bedroom. Lelio is acutely sensitive to the absurdities of everyday life, including the comedy of humiliation, both petty and wounding. But while his characters can be cruel, he never succumbs to meanness. His generosity is animated by Moore's limpid, precise performance. An emotionally open character, Gloria laughs easily and listens closely, often leaning into others when they talk. But she holds back, too, keeping part of herself hidden, which feels natural given all the years that she's spent taking care of people, her family, her friends, her clients. (The cast includes Michael Cera, Brad Garrett, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Rita Wilson and Holland Taylor.) As a performer, Moore can go big, and a terrible yowl here pierces the heart. But she's a virtuoso of restraint. She shows you the rush of emotions just before they break the surface, so the hurt and confusion flicker on her face like minute shifts of light.

""Gloria Bell"" is at once obvious and filled with ambiguities, like the raging neighbor upstairs having a nervous breakdown, a man whose violent, mysterious thundering periodically shakes her apartment and equilibrium. Lelio lets some of his scenes play out from beginning to rounded end, but he also likes to cut away before the joint is completely smoked, the conversation finished, so you can fill in the ellipses. He's playing with the idiom of the women's picture, but he self-consciously approaches the genre with expressionistic flourishes -- ripples and blasts of color, luminous and diffuse lighting -- that show his debt both to Rainer Werner Fassbinder and to old Hollywood. He tips his hand openly with the casting of Barbara Sukowa, the star of Fassbinder's ""Lola,"" who briefly appears as a co-worker of Gloria's who's struggling in the job. She's worried about the future and, during a short break at the insurance company, the women speak anxiously about retirement money. The scene is almost over before it begins but it offers a glimpse of a world of cruelty and confusion that also pulses under the surface here, suggesting why Gloria likes to lose herself on the dance floor. Gloria dances because it makes her happy, but also maybe because like many -- as the song says -- she's on the run.","The Chilean writer-director Sebastián Lelio finds a perfect partner in Moore for this fantastic remake of his 2013 movie ""Gloria.""",c81622df-0f7b-5e29-bd54-aea2fa80ea46,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/08/arts/08gloriabell-print-1/08gloriabell-print-1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=59977d26a5d48e710c6650fd29bd302a0937a8333f371fc9f23273b4042e6292&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Julianne Moore plays the title role in ""Gloria Bell,"" Sebastián Lelio's ""cover version"" of his 2013 movie ""Gloria.""",c81622df-0f7b-5e29-bd54-aea2fa80ea46,N24News/imgs/c81622df-0f7b-5e29-bd54-aea2fa80ea46.jpg,5
Real Estate,Going to New Heights to Please Buyers,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/realestate/going-to-new-heights-to-please-buyers.html,"Until recently, if you were looking to buy a condominium with high ceilings, your choice was limited to prewar apartments, lofts or penthouse units. Now several developers are offering new condo projects that have soaring ceilings in more than half the building, giving buyers the option of taking a unit on a lower floor with ceilings 11 feet or higher. ""Today, 11-foot ceilings are the new eight-foot ceilings,"" said Izak Senbahar, the president of the Alexico Group, a developer behind the TriBeCa condo tower 56 Leonard. Unlike a kitchen that you can renovate to your liking, a ceiling can't be pushed higher once the building is constructed, he said. The 60-story condominium at 56 Leonard incorporates ceiling heights of 11 to 19 feet in each of its 145 units. ""You can't fake the sense of space, air and light without high ceilings,"" Mr. Senbahar said. Higher ceilings generally translate into higher construction costs, but some developers feel the money is well spent, since high ceilings can help create grander spaces. The extra height can set a development apart from the pack and be a helpful marketing tool as the city's high-end real estate market begins to soften.

On a national level, most buyers of a standard home prefer nine-foot ceilings on the first floor, according to a 2015 survey conducted by the National Association of Home Builders. In New York City, while prewar buildings tended toward nine-foot ceilings, most postwar buildings were built with eight-foot ceilings because it was more affordable to do so, according to Richard Lambeck, clinical associate professor and chairman of the construction management graduate program at the New York University School of Professional Studies Schack Institute of Real Estate. Apartments were compact, which also coincided with the availability of portable air-conditioning units, he said. ""With high ceilings, developers can lose an entire floor and, at the same time, add another 15 percent to their construction costs,"" Mr. Lambeck said.

The need to use multiple sheetrock panels for the walls, add more bolts, and order customized doors and windows all add to the cost of the final product. Increasing the ceiling height from eight to nine feet adds an extra $4,000 to the cost of an average home, according to the home builders' survey. Arthur W. Zeckendorf, a principal of Zeckendorf Development, estimated that placing 11-foot ceilings in the 33 units at 520 Park Avenue was adding an extra 10 percent to his building costs, and adding 10 percent more time to the construction schedule for the 54-story structure.

Nicholas Werner, a founder of Largo Investments, one of the developers of the Fitzroy in Chelsea, where all the rooms will have 11-foot ceilings, said, ""There's no need to build a room that's an echo chamber, but we wanted to build a home that seemed gracious and proportionate."" Technological advancement in building materials has also made it easier for developers to expand in volume, Mr. Werner said. For example, residences at the Fitzroy will have hydronic radiant floor heating, and not just in the bathroom, where it is customarily found, to better heat the entire home, since warm air rises. Larger windows that were selected in proportion to the higher ceilings add more natural light, which cuts electricity costs, he said. Vickey Barron, an associate broker at Douglas Elliman, said she started to notice clients' asking about ceiling heights about five years ago. ""I now have clients who will give up having a pool or other amenities in a building, but will not budge on ceiling height,"" she said. ""Buying a home is an emotional thing, and that 'wow' factor a high ceiling provides is something you can't replace."" Lori Goldstein, a fashion stylist and creator of the LOGO clothing line, is one such buyer. After living in a Chelsea loft for almost 15 years, she is set to close on an apartment at 10 Sullivan Street, a new condo complex on the southwestern edge of SoHo that has ceiling heights of 11 feet in all 22 units in the tower. In addition, four townhouses in the complex have 11.7-foot ceilings. ""I can't stand being claustrophobic,"" Ms. Goldstein said. ""There's something about a room that's taller than it is wider."" To show potential buyers how one feels in an expansive room, some developers have taken the extra step of finding a showroom large enough to build an exact replica of a room with such height -- no small task in itself.

""It's impossible to explain"" the impact of ceiling height, he said. ""You have to experience it."" It took the developers behind 20 East End Avenue, where units will have 11-foot ceilings, about a year to find a commercial space for their showroom, according to Nicole Siciliano-Trazzera, the sales director at the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, who is marketing the new building. ""It's been the best sales tool,"" she said. ""The reaction is utter amazement.""

* Hidden Feats: Our critic looks at some supertall N.Y.C. buildings and how the ingenuity of engineers helped build landmarks. Homes with large rooms and high ceilings are often sought by buyers with art collections. Every livable room at 180 East 88th Street will come with art rails that hang a few feet below the ceiling. Not only are the rails convenient for hanging art, but they also help bring one's sight line just a bit lower, making you feel more grounded in a room that is extra tall, Mr. McMillan said. And sometimes it's all about the view. When designing the Gibraltar, a new six-story condo building going up at 160 West Street in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, the architect Joseph Eisner said he wanted future residents to enjoy the views of Manhattan and the East River from the living room, which will have 11.3-foot ceilings. ""I didn't consider lower ceiling heights, because I wanted the cleanest, freest feel,"" so common areas feel larger than they are, Mr. Eisner said. How to incorporate a sense of space in home design has always been part of the discussion for architecture students, said James Garrison, an architect and adjunct associate professor at the Pratt Institute's School of Architecture. ""Sure, you can have bragging rights when you have high ceilings, but people can really feel space,"" he said. ""And the way you design a room with height can bring a hierarchy to how certain rooms are utilized."" Ashwin Y. Verma, a founder of Siras Development, which is building the Soori High Line on West 29th Street, where about 80 percent of the 31 condos will have 13- to 18-foot ceilings, says new condo construction will incorporate higher ceilings from here on. ""I think the market is moving toward"" measuring rooms in cubic feet, he said. ""As a developer, the New York market is one of the few places where you can change the story on architecture like this and still get rewarded.""","Higher ceilings generally increase construction costs, but developers feel the money is well spent since high ceilings lend themselves to grander spaces.",66462ccc-3e7b-531d-ba12-3f58761f1d26,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/27/realestate/27CEILINGCOV/27CEILINGCOV-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=13ef6847c4a6632e02ab37ee42111a34f1570d4f98ce7ae56098201eb5a4ea79&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Lori Goldstein is set to close on an apartment at 10 Sullivan Street, a new condominium complex in SoHo, where ceiling heights reach 11 feet in all 22 units in the tower.",66462ccc-3e7b-531d-ba12-3f58761f1d26,N24News/imgs/66462ccc-3e7b-531d-ba12-3f58761f1d26.jpg,7
Technology,Uber's First Earnings Report After I.P.O.: $1 Billion Loss,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/technology/uber-stock-earnings.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Uber's start as a publicly traded company has gone from bumpy to bumpier. In its first earnings report since listing its shares on the stock market this month, the ride-hailing giant on Thursday reported its slowest growth in years and steep losses for the first three months of 2019. Uber's loss totaled more than $1 billion for the quarter, compared with a profit a year ago that was driven by divestitures. Revenue rose 20 percent to $3.1 billion, slower than the 25 percent annual growth it had recorded in the prior quarter. It was the company's lowest quarterly growth rate since it began disclosing its results in 2017. The results compounded a turbulent few months for Uber. This year was supposed to have been a triumph for the company, with what was set to be a glorious initial public offering. But that offering ended with a whimper as investors questioned whether the deeply unprofitable company could ever make money. Uber's stock has since fallen more than 11 percent, and its executives have been excoriated for their performance. Uber's arc mirrors that of its rival Lyft, which went public in March. Lyft's shares have since fallen below their offering price, and the company recently reported a quarterly loss that also exceeded $1 billion. The size of the losses for both companies has raised questions about how viable ride-hailing can be as a business.

The troubled stock market debuts of Uber and Lyft have sent jitters through the rest of Silicon Valley, where other prominent tech companies have also been planning to go public. Slack, the workplace collaboration company, for example, plans to list its shares next month. WeWork, the real estate firm, and the food-delivery company Postmates are also in the pipeline. Uber's executives chose to focus on the positive on Thursday. Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive, emphasized that its users were more engaged with the ride-hailing company than ever before and that it continued to dominate in the regions where it operated, including a 69 percent market share in the United States. But he also indicated that Uber's losses would not end anytime soon because the company planned to keep spending to expand. Uber's costs and expenses totaled $4.1 billion in the first quarter, up 35 percent from a year earlier. ""We are now focused on executing our strategy to become an one-stop shop for local transportation and commerce,"" Mr. Khosrowshahi said. Nelson Chai, Uber's chief financial officer, added that the company was investing in ""product and technology differentiation"" but was also willing to outspend competitors in the core ride-hailing business. ""We will not hesitate to invest to defend our market position globally,"" he said.

Uber's shares, which have fallen from their $45 offering price, rose in after-hours trading on Thursday. Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, which manages exchange-traded funds focused on I.P.O.s., said Wall Street had expected the losses and slowing growth because Uber had indicated them in its I.P.O. paperwork. ""If Uber does nothing worse than it said, it may be a good result for them,"" she said. The company's results included some bright spots. Uber has a lengthy history of battling competitors in fierce price wars, offering subsidies to riders and drivers. But Mr. Khosrowshahi said those fights were beginning to subside, with competitors focusing on building their brand and products rather than on paying incentives. He called it ""a healthy trend."" Some of Uber's newer businesses, such as food delivery and freight delivery, also grew at a healthy pace. Uber Eats, its meal delivery service, more than doubled from a year earlier, while Freight jumped more than 200 percent. The company is expanding Uber Eats in Latin America as well as in Japan, where ride-hailing is not permitted. In an earnings call, some analysts raised questions about whether Uber Eats could sustain its growth in the face of heavy competition, and whether Uber's price wars would shift from ride-hailing to food delivery. Mr. Khosrowshahi said Uber expected to remain the largest food delivery service outside China, whether it held its position through competition or by acquiring a competitor. Any acquisition would be a Plan B, he said. He also faced questions about one of Uber's biggest markets: New York. Recent city legislation imposes a minimum wage for ride-hailing drivers, who are classified as independent contractors rather than as employees. As a result, ride-hailing rates for passengers in New York had increased significantly, Mr. Khosrowshahi said, and the volume of rides had declined. Still, he said, the market remains valuable to Uber. Mr. Khosrowshahi also addressed Uber's I.P.O., saying he was ""proud of what we've achieved."" He added, ""I've told our team it is just one moment in a longer journey.""",The ride-hailing giant's quarterly report raised questions about where the company would find new growth and whether it could ever make money.,d385ee98-207c-5c8b-aab7-1cc7e68f09f7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/30/business/30uber/30uber-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=4c03cc4c2a8fca1526dcfdbd24bead1b9be214cd4d79974c834c1fff45992f61&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Uber's first results as a public company came after several difficult months and were a disappointment after what had been high hopes for its I.P.O.,d385ee98-207c-5c8b-aab7-1cc7e68f09f7,N24News/imgs/d385ee98-207c-5c8b-aab7-1cc7e68f09f7.jpg,20
Food,A Summer Lunch That Feels Like a Splurge,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/14/dining/lobster-salad-recipe.html,"A pandemic has many downsides. And the lobster industry is among the many sectors it's taken a toll on.

If you're in the business of selling lobster, you currently have a lot of lobster available and a dearth of wholesale customers, not the ideal situation.

But there can be some bright spots, depending on how you look at it.

If you're a home cook, you'll be glad to know that lobsters are cheaper than ever -- less than $6 a pound at many supermarkets. So, in theory, at these prices, you could be having lobster once or twice a week, not just for special occasions.

Sports,"New Jersey Embraces Sports Gambling, and a Billion-Dollar Business Is Born",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/sports/sports-gambling-new-jersey.html,"EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Lisa Kerney once earned her living hosting ""SportsCenter"" on ESPN, making her a nightly fixture in the vast American conversation between sports fans and their favorite athletes, teams and leagues. Her latest endeavor, she believes, is just as all-American. Every Saturday, Kerney slips into the anchor's chair of a very different kind of television program: a sports betting show from a makeshift studio at the Meadowlands Racetrack. Instead of reporting just scores and news, Kerney now also rattles off N.F.L. point spreads and money-line odds as easily as a CNBC host talks stock prices and P/E ratios. She will be on the air again this Sunday, serving up information on the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams in the hours before Super Bowl LIII. The game will take its place in American gambling history because, for the first time, bettors will be allowed to wager on the N.F.L.'s championship game legally, not only in Nevada but also in seven other states. By next year, gambling may be legal in more than a dozen more states, a shift that is already moving betting on games into the mainstream of American culture and teaching fans to look at the sports contests they love as investment opportunities as well as entertainment.

""Now fans are able to play the game within the game,"" Kerney said. ""It goes beyond the nuts and bolts of who's going to win. It is a whole new way of experiencing sports."" Last May, when the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that prohibited expanded sports gambling, it created -- almost overnight -- a billion-dollar market that bookmakers, media companies, tech entrepreneurs, touts and quants have rushed in to dominate. On the high end, that has meant sports shows that incorporate into their coverage market-moving information like injury reports and their effect on bettors. But it also means digital subscription services that make a tsunami of sports data available, and app makers eager to help bettors slice it.

""If you have a way to make betting more fun, or to otherwise increase consumer investment in betting, the market needs you,"" said Chris Grove, a managing director at Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, an independent research firm. ""If you have a way to salve any of the pain points for consumers in the regulated sports betting -- the learning curve, hassles with payments, ensuring that you're getting the price -- then the market absolutely needs you.""

* Playoff Simulator: Explore every team's path to the postseason, updated live. As sports betting and bills are being shepherded through legislatures in at least 15 other states, the early returns show there is plenty of opportunity in what is a familiar but nascent industry. In New Jersey, for example, sportsbooks at Meadowlands Racetrack and their online counterparts have handled more than $1.2 billion in wagers since the market was born in mid-June, despite having only three brick-and-mortar outlets in the early going and no availability for online wagering until August. If retail and online wagering were to become accessible in all 50 states, Eilers & Krejcik predicted, sports betting in America could become a $16 billion industry. Figures from regulators in Mississippi and Rhode Island also show an upward trend. New Jersey is on pace to surpass Nevada in sports wagering. And though market oversaturation could eventually slow or halt the industry's rapid growth, that is not a pressing concern. Legalized sports betting has already changed the way some fans consume sports. This month, NBC Sports Washington Plus, a regional sports network, offered an alternate telecast of several Washington Wizards games, starting with one against the Milwaukee Bucks, that looked like a cross between CNBC and ESPNews. Unlike most N.B.A. telecasts, the productions included statistics, odds and point spreads alongside the live action. It was a preview of what game telecasts may look like in a mature sports betting landscape.

Last year, for example, $159 million was bet on the Super Bowl legally in Nevada, a respectable take for any business but one that paled in comparison to the estimates of the amount -- as high as $4.6 billion -- wagered on the game illegally. This year, with eight states now offering legal sports betting, projections for wagering on Sunday's Super Bowl LIII have risen to more than $325 million, according to PlayUSA, which monitors the legal sports market. That haul is expected to soar as more states bring betting on games out of the realm of corner-bar bookies and offshore operators and onto their tax rolls. At the same time, the popularity of fantasy sports and the growing amounts of easily accessible data and analytics have not merely hastened the acceptance of sports betting: They have transformed the nature of fandom.

""This is a generational thing, and what we've seen is a perfect storm develop over the last 20 years, with a boom in fantasy sports, the interest in 'moneyball' and the democracy of information through technology,"" said Chad Millman, the chief content officer at The Action Network, a subscriber-based media company. ""It's meant that fans have become more opportunistic about their fandom. They think about winning individually, not about rooting for a team."" The Action Network runs a website and an app offering data, research and betting tools, as well as general coverage of sports and the nuances of cashing in on them. It also produces a betting show -- called ""I'll Take That Bet"" -- for ESPN+, the sports broadcaster's new streaming platform. Millman would not say how many subscribers the Action Network has in its first year, but since April, he said, users of the company's app have logged 13 million bets, and the circulation of the Action Network's email newsletter has grown nearly tenfold, to 240,000. ""In general, sports fans want to be smarter than their friends,"" Millman said. ""As sports betting becomes more and more part of the conversation, people are trying to figure out what the language of it is.""

For now at least, there is a difference between a general sports audience and sports betting audience, a gap Kerney, the former ""SportsCenter"" anchor, is trying to navigate on her show, created by the bookmaker FanDuel, from the Meadowlands. ""Most sports bettors will notice every second on or off the clock, every yard, every pitch, every shot, because any of these can ultimately affect their bets,"" said Kevin Grigsby, the show's executive producer. ""So your story, programming, messaging needs narrative that caters to both cohorts."" Kerney and Grigsby's bosses at FanDuel are making a big bet that they can close that gap quickly. FanDuel is owned by the European bookmakers Paddy Power, as is TVG, the cable network that is home to Kerney's show. TVG reaches 40 million homes and gives horseplayers wall-to-wall coverage of races that they can bet on through a proprietary website or app. As sports betting expands, TVG is poised to also expand programming like Kerney's show. FanDuel already takes bets on all sports. With a more than half-century head start on legalized betting, European bookmakers handled more than $13 billion in wagers in 2018, according to Eilers & Krejcik. That is a number Paddy Power and other bookmakers expect the United States market to surpass in as few as five to seven years. ""The biggest advantage we have right now is that the leagues, the networks, or me and you don't have to pretend anymore that there are not hundreds of millions of dollars bet every day on the games we follow,"" Kerney said. ""We are here to educate and inform but also to become an authority in this space. If we do our jobs, we believe people who follow us will make money.""","A Supreme Court ruling that expanded legal betting on sports has produced a gambling gold rush.

Movies,'State Like Sleep' Review: A Suspicious Suicide Drives This Suffocating Thriller,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/movies/state-like-sleep-review.html,"Far from a fantasy, but not quite a nightmare, ""State Like Sleep"" is a thriller without thrills, where every setting that was once familiar has become loaded with a sense of dread. It pauses before turning any corner, anticipating horrors that never satisfyingly arrive.

The movie follows Katherine (Katherine Waterston), the wife of Stefan Delvoe (Michiel Huisman), a rising Belgian film star who died in an apparent suicide. Their marriage was a rocky one, shaken by revelations about Stefan's drug use and the possibility that he was unfaithful. It was Katherine who found Stefan's body with a bullet lodged in his temple.

One year after Stefan's death, Katherine returns to their home in Brussels. Her mother (Mary Kay Place) has suffered a minor stroke and is in need of medical care. In between her visits to the hospital, Katherine unpacks the mess Stefan left behind. She finds matchboxes with the name of his favorite club written on them -- the first bread crumb in a trail that leads Katherine to suspect her husband's death was a conspiracy.

Katherine retraces Stefan's final days and finds herself submerged in a world of nightclubs and narcotics.

Media,"Ruth Sulzberger Holmberg, Newspaper Publisher Born for the Job, Dies at 96",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/business/media/ruth-sulzberger-holmberg-newspaper-publisher-dies-at-96.html,"Ruth Sulzberger Holmberg, who challenged racial barriers, political skulduggery and environmental adversaries as publisher of The Chattanooga Times in Tennessee for nearly three decades, and who was a member of the family that controls The New York Times, died on Wednesday at her home in Chattanooga. She was 96. Growing up in a newspaper family in New York, Mrs. Holmberg was imbued from adolescence with journalistic traditions of social responsibility, and that heritage became manifest in Chattanooga as she presided over a newspaper known for aggressive, analytical reporting and editorials that denounced racial segregation, exposed government corruption and demanded cleaner air in a city of heavy industry and belching smokestacks. For years she was a pariah in a city where many regarded her as an Eastern liberal interloper. Mrs. Holmberg, who was publisher of The Chattanooga Times from 1964 to 1992, stayed on as publisher emeritus and chairwoman until 1999, when it was sold to a small chain and merged with a rival newspaper. (Though it was owned by her family, the paper was never part of The New York Times Company.) She was a granddaughter of Adolph S. Ochs, who bought The Chattanooga Times in 1878 and The New York Times in 1896, and the second of four children of Iphigene Ochs and Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the publisher of The New York Times from 1935 to 1961.

Her brother, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, who died in 2012, became publisher of The New York Times and chairman and chief executive of the Times Company. One sister, Marian Sulzberger Heiskell, became a New York civic and philanthropic leader. Another, Judith P. Sulzberger, who died in 2011, became a doctor affiliated with the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University. A Smith College graduate who had been a Red Cross volunteer in England and France during World War II, Mrs. Holmberg (her name from a second marriage) was a 25-year-old Sulzberger heiress when she and her first husband, Ben Hale Golden, arrived in Chattanooga in 1946 -- not to take over her family's newspaper but to begin Mr. Golden's career on it. With no journalistic experience, he was to be groomed for the publisher's post. Chattanooga, a city of 140,000 in southeastern Tennessee, was nothing remotely like the New York City where Mrs. Holmberg had grown up, in Manhattan. It did not welcome Eastern liberals or Jews, even secular Jews who were married to Christians, as she was. Racial segregation was practiced there and ""outsiders"" were distrusted. Music, art and other cultural offerings were limited. But the couple settled there, and after a long apprenticeship, Mr. Golden was named publisher in 1957. During his seven-year tenure, The Chattanooga Times, a morning paper with a circulation of about 40,000, turned profits but was shunned by many readers and advertisers, who preferred a rival paper that often skirted local controversies and offered a deeply conservative viewpoint.

The Chattanooga Times championed the racial integration of schools and universities, supported civil rights legislation in Congress and backed clean-air laws, provoking anger in a city where industrial pollutants shrouded scenic mountain backdrops and whose air, according to a 1969 federal report, was the dirtiest in the nation. The Times also endorsed reforms to root out corruption in government, expand the voting franchise and give black residents, a third of the population, a larger voice in municipal affairs. In the 1970s, The Times fought pitched battles with its hometown competitor, The News-Free Press, although the rivalry was muted under a joint operating agreement reached in the 1980s allowing the two papers to operate a single business department but separate newsrooms and editorial voices. In 1972, she married Albert William Holmberg Jr., who oversaw the production, advertising and circulation departments at the paper. He was later named its president. As her influence widened, Mrs. Holmberg became nationally prominent. She was elected president of the Southern Newspaper Publishers Association in 1984, and in 1987 became the second woman, after Katharine Graham, the longtime publisher of The Washington Post, to be elected a director of The Associated Press, the dominant news service in the United States. She and her siblings transferred ownership to their 13 children in 1997. Over the next two years, Walter E. Hussman Jr., head of the Wehco Media Company, bought The News-Free Press and The Times and merged them to become The Chattanooga Times Free Press.

Mrs. Holmberg was on the board of The New York Times for 37 years. Stepping down in 1998, she remained a principal owner of the company under a trust that had passed to her and her three siblings on the death of their mother in 1990. Ruth Rachel Sulzberger was born in New York City on March 12, 1921. She and her siblings grew up surrounded by maids, butlers, nannies, chauffeurs and other servants. She attended the Lincoln School, an experimental adjunct to Columbia Teachers College; and Brearley, a private school on the Upper East Side, before enrolling at Smith, in Northampton, Mass.

As a college student she wanted to work one day for The Times, and did some reporting on her summer and holiday breaks. She wrote a magazine article about wartime changes at women's colleges, and once spent two days driving a taxi in New York for a story. But after graduating in 1943, as World War II raged in Europe, she joined the American Red Cross as an unpaid volunteer and sailed for England. She was assigned to the 394th Bombardment Group of the Ninth Air Force near Chelmsford, 30 miles northeast of London and a few miles from the North Sea coast. There she lived in a drafty Quonset hut, walked planks over muddy paths and, with her Red Cross comrades, met the B-26 Marauders limping home from missions over the Continent. The airfield was sometimes bombed by German planes, she recalled. ""Whatever they hadn't dropped on London, they dropped on us,"" she told Susan E. Tifft and Alex S. Jones for their 1999 book, ""The Trust,"" a history of the Ochs and Sulzberger families and The New York Times.

At the military base, she met Ben Golden, a married Army Air Force officer who had been a manager for the Tennessee Valley Authority. After the Normandy invasion in 1944, they moved with the 394th to France and stayed for the duration. Mr. Golden's first marriage ended in divorce, and within a year after the war, Ruthie, as her father affectionately called her, was married and in Chattanooga, where she would settle, raise her children and make her mark. Mrs. Holmberg is survived by the four children from her first marriage: Stephen Golden, a retired lawyer who was president of the Times Company's forest products group; Michael Golden, who recently retired as vice chairman of the Times Company; Lynn G. Dolnick, a Ph.D biologist and retired associate director of the Smithsonian's National Zoo; and Arthur Sulzberger Golden, author of the best-selling 1997 novel ""Memoirs of a Geisha."" Their father died in 1970. Mrs. Holmberg is also survived by her sister Ms. Heiskell; her stepdaughters, Jeanne Johnson, Meg Duckworth and Elin Holmberg-Rowland; seven grandchildren, eight great-grandchildren, seven step-grandchildren and a number of step-great-grandchildren. Mr. Holmberg died in 2005. Her nephew Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr. is publisher of The New York Times and chairman of the Times Company. One of her grandsons, Sam Dolnick, is an assistant editor of The Times. Mrs. Holmberg, who received an honorary doctorate in humane letters from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga in 2007, contributed millions to cultural institutions, universities and educational programs for journalists, notably at the graduate schools of journalism at Columbia University and the City University of New York. After leaving The Chattanooga Times, she remained active in philanthropy and civic affairs. Among other positions, Mrs. Holmberg was a director of the Smithsonian Institution, a trustee of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, a founding member of the Tennessee Arts Commission, a member of the Tennessee Higher Education Commission, chairwoman of the Public Education Foundation, director emeritus of the Hunter Museum of American Art, a director of the Chattanooga Symphony and Opera Association, president of the Chattanooga Area Chamber of Commerce (the first woman to hold that post) and a director of the Chattanooga Community Foundation, the Tennessee Aquarium and the Chattanooga Area Beautification Committee.","A member of the family that controls The New York Times, Mrs. Holmberg challenged racial barriers, political skulduggery and environmental adversaries as publisher of The Chattanooga Times.",8bbcd29a-e49a-52a3-8abd-597166bf5b41,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/20/business/20holmberg-obit-3/20holmberg-obit-3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=3d10f347b57d2fe2b0aed9b626191ff44e0353a653a714a65d6b5a0f8d8b7dcd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ruth Sulzberger Holmberg at The Chattanooga Times with Paul Neely, its publisher at the time, on Jan. 4, 1999, the last day the newspaper was published under that name.",8bbcd29a-e49a-52a3-8abd-597166bf5b41,N24News/imgs/8bbcd29a-e49a-52a3-8abd-597166bf5b41.jpg,16
Theater,Review: Everyday Chatter Unveils a Mystery in 'Say Something Bunny!',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/theater/review-say-something-bunny-alison-kobayashi.html,"Audience members sit at a circular table surrounding Alison S. M. Kobayashi -- and take on roles -- in ""Say Something Bunny!""

A suburban family invites the neighbors to dinner. There are jokes and slights and a brief mention of the football game. Someone asks for a cake recipe. Someone else sings a song. It sounds punishingly ordinary. It is. It is also an out-and-out thrill. That long-ago dinner party fills out the first act of ""Say Something Bunny!,"" a play by Alison S.M. Kobayashi and Christopher Allen that is part documentary, part puzzle and part time-traveling immersion, with a passing foray into adult entertainment. A few years ago, Ms. Kobayashi found herself in possession of a wire recorder, an obsolete magnetic device that enjoyed a quick midcentury vogue, and two reels. She played those reels and through the hissing and the overtalk, she could just make out a conversation.

So go ahead and think of ""Say Something Bunny!"" as a detective story, but know that its mysteries are mellower and stranger than what a census search can solve. And by the way, you are part of the solution. Ms. Kobayashi and Mr. Allen, her co-writer, co-producer, dramaturge and husband, stage ""Say Something Bunny!"" in a small space in Chelsea up a small flight of stairs. The room only holds 24 people and as your name is called, you can choose a seat at a circular table -- painted black and white to resemble a wire reel -- or behind the music stands arrayed in the back. Ms. Kobayashi, dressed simply in a white T-shirt and white jeans will play the reels for you, inviting you to read along in the script and occasionally pausing to explain her research or to show a photo, a video, a few frames of sprightly animation. Though audience members are made to stand in for each of the characters, the participation-phobic should know that only Ms. Kobayashi moves and speaks. For the rest of us, presence is enough. (Me? I was cast as a dog. I liked it.)

I want to tell you so much more about ""Say Something Bunny!"" but for those of you who will be lucky enough to see it (it's been playing since the summer, closes in April, tickets are only $40, hurry hurry hurry) ruining its surprises would be like stamping on a souffle. I'm not that kind of monster. I will tell you that Ms. Kobayashi's tender obsession with this material is as catching as the chickenpox, and if the piece is forthrightly funny and briefly pornographic, it is also sneakily moving. Toward the end I found myself fighting back tears. I hadn't really met any of these characters; most of them have been dead for decades. I'd only heard them and seen Ms. Kobayashi's exaggerated re-enactments. (She is an expert guide and maybe a less than expert actress.) It still felt like a loss to leave them behind and as soon as I was home I Googled one. Because my sleuthing can't rival Ms. Kobayashi's I'll never know if he fulfilled his boyhood dream and became a radio announcer. I hope he did. If ""Say Something Bunny!"" feels sui generis, there are a few theater pieces, like Doug Wright's ""I Am My Own Wife"" or the work of W. David Hancock, that have previously meshed drama, documentary and off-kilter investigation. (Some movies and podcasts have done it, too. I was often reminded of the classic ""This American Life"" episode, ""House on Loon Lake."") Like these works, ""Say Something Bunny!"" is about more than the particulars. It's a low-key ontological thriller about how we live and what we leave and how we account for ourselves when some kid comes at us with a microphone. ""What do you want me to say?"" Bunny, the neighbor's girl, asks at the end of that first dinner. More than 60 years later here we are, in a second-floor room on the West Side of Manhattan, breathless to know what she comes up with.",Alison S.M.

Economy,Many Detect End of Line for Stimulus by the Fed,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/business/economy/many-detect-shift-by-fed-on-program-to-buy-bonds.html,"WASHINGTON -- The beginning of the end probably will not come on Wednesday, but it is coming soon. The Federal Reserve has made clear that its bond-buying campaign will not continue at the present pace for much longer. Almost from the outset of the campaign last fall, some Fed officials have expressed doubts about the economic benefits and concern about the consequences of a deepening commitment to a relatively untested approach to monetary policy. So far, the realities of high unemployment and slow growth have outweighed those misgivings, and the Fed has continued to expand, by $85 billion a month, its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. Analysts generally expect the Fed's policy-making committee, which meets on Tuesday and Wednesday, to once again defer any changes in the program, although a spate of stronger economic news has increased the odds of a policy shift. Even among Fed officials who support the bond-buying program, however, there is general agreement that the Fed should taper off on its bond buying and focus on stimulating the economy by other means. It's just a matter of timing.

The broad outlines of the shift also are clear. The Fed intends to lean even more heavily on ""forward guidance,"" trying to hold down borrowing costs for businesses and consumers by declaring its intent to keep short-term interest rates near zero. ""We have sought to ease financial conditions further and provide additional impetus to the recovery,"" Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Monday at a celebration of the Fed's 100th anniversary, ""by communicating, both quantitatively about the likely future path of our policy rate and qualitatively about the likely evolution of our balance sheet."" The event, a rare break from the Fed's general practice of avoiding public comment in the days before a policy meeting, was held as a matter of convenience because so many Fed officials were already planning to be in Washington this week. The actual anniversary is Dec. 23. Attendees included the former Fed chairmen Alan Greenspan and Paul A. Volcker, along with Janet L. Yellen, who is expected to be confirmed by the Senate this week to lead the Fed for the next four years. Fed officials say that the impending shift reflects the progress of the economic recovery, and that it could improve the effectiveness of forward guidance by focusing public attention on a single stimulus program. But there are plenty of skeptics. Stanley Fischer, the former governor of the Bank of Israel and leading candidate to be nominated by President Obama as the next vice chairman of the Fed, has suggested in recent public remarks that the power of forward guidance is constrained because the future is unpredictable, so investors will correctly discount the Fed's forecasts.

Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, has advanced a similar critique, arguing that bond buying is a more effective form of stimulus than forward guidance, and that investors are more likely to take the Fed seriously when it acts, not just talks. Mr. Bernanke and his allies say that bond buying will soon have served its purpose. While academics have struggled to isolate the effects of the campaign, officials assert that it has helped to lower a wide range of borrowing costs, leading to increased sales of cars and other consumer goods, and contributing to a modest climb in job creation. Some Fed officials argue that these benefits have begun to diminish. Moreover, on a technical level, bond buying has stronger effects when financial markets are in disarray. ""The bottom line is that diminishing returns will eventually affect any bond purchase strategy, whatever its design and initial effects,"" the International Monetary Fund concluded in an analysis published in April. ""Policy makers most likely need to either accept this diminishing impact or adopt new and more radical policy frameworks over time."" But there is no consensus inside the Fed that the benefits of the bond buying, often referred to as ""quantitative easing,"" are wearing off. ""I don't buy this diminishing returns thing,"" James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television last month. ""If you lowered the funds rate from 5 percent to 4 percent, and then you lowered it from 4 percent to 3 percent, you probably wouldn't say that the second hundred basis points was less effective than the first 100 basis points. And I don't think we should say that about the Q.E. program either."" Officials are also not particularly afraid of inflation. While some Fed officials worry about the risk that buying bonds will lead to faster inflation, the Fed, if anything, is increasingly confronting the opposite problem. Several Fed officials in recent weeks have expressed puzzlement over why prices have been rising at an unusually sluggish pace.

There is another technical issue. Lower federal deficits have reduced the issuance of government debt, so the Fed is buying a growing share. And as higher interest rates have reduced the demand for mortgage loans, the Fed is buying a larger share of government-backed mortgage bonds, too. ""The best argument for tapering sooner rather than later?"" Peter R. Fisher, senior director at the BlackRock Investment Institute, wrote in a recent analysis. ""The Fed is running out of stuff to buy."" He estimated that if it maintained the current level of asset purchases, the Fed could soon be consuming all the new issuance of Treasuries and mortgage bonds. But the most important risk associated with bond buying is also the most fundamental. The point of the program is to encourage risk-taking by business executives and investors, but one of the Fed's main concerns is to avoid encouraging too much risk-taking. For now, there is a greater risk to worry about: that the economy could slip back toward recession if the Fed fails to do enough to encourage growth. As the economy shows signs of improving health, however, the Fed is reverting to its most basic fear: that it will do too much.",Even officials who support the stimulus agree that the Federal Reserve should taper off on its bond buying and focus on stimulating the economy by other means. It's just a matter of timing.,22440a57-d17b-5a29-8853-94be1b413afd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/17/business/international/17fed/17fed-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=422&w=600&s=c61c2abddb41150320b128dce6665df1cdc8431fa02623e1639bba7f6e5903c0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Current and past leaders of the Federal Reserve marked its 100th anniversary on Monday: From left, Janet L.

Food,Finding Strength in Sofrito in Puerto Rico,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/26/dining/puerto-rican-food.html,"From her home in Cayey, P.R., the chef Natalia Vallejo speaks with measured sadness about shutting down Cocina al Fondo, her intimate farm-to-table restaurant in San Juan. But the closing amid this particular crisis feels different than if there had been a storm. After a hurricane, people typically gather, forming a rebulu -- a spontaneous, noisy all-nighter that spills out into the streets, with a big pot of sancocho stew simmering on the stove. Imagine Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's video for the song ""Despacito,"" but without electricity, and with the swirling smell of plantains. ""Family and friends would come together, each one contributing what they could,"" Ms. Vallejo said. ""We shared, we laughed, we cried. Almost every day I cooked and ate with friends or family -- we would light the grill and listen to music."" Instead, she has remained at home, separated from her family. To live and eat in Puerto Rico means being prepared for disruption, particularly between June and November -- hurricane season, which now appears to be worsening as a result of climate change.

In major storms, residents may lose electricity and phone service, effectively cutting off communication from the outside world, as well as access to drinking water and fresh food. The earliest storm on record was Hurricane San Roque in 1508, but dozens have swept the island since. It's not a question of whether the hurricane will come, but when. A pandemic is different. Many on the island have said that Covid-19 is worse than even Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017, because the virus has exposed longstanding inequities and prevented the kind of in-person community response that follows a storm.

But even amid food insecurity, and with limited ingredients, Puerto Ricans cook in ways that are soul-nourishing and emphasize flavor. Making magic out of food scraps is the way they've always cooked -- an expression of ancestry, adaptability and fortitude. Take mofongo. Plantains, which were brought to the Caribbean from Africa to feed enslaved workers, are deep-fried, blended with Spanish ingredients like garlic, olive oil and pork cracklings, then mashed in a large wooden pilon, a mortar and pestle with Indigenous Taino roots. Plantains grow in abundance across Puerto Rico, and can be harvested from the ground after a storm. Mofongo is intensely flavorful and satisfying, and remains one of the most popular dishes on the island. Then there's arroz con pollo: rice and chicken, the island's ultimate comfort food. A dish that does a lot with very little, it starts with chicken sauteed in sofrito, a blend of garlic, onions, peppers and recao or culantro, an earthy cousin of cilantro that thrives on the island. The chicken is then cooked in stock with rice -- also brought to the island by the Spanish and cultivated by enslaved African and Indigenous workers -- along with whatever other ingredients are on hand. This is one of many one-pot, slow-cooked rice dishes that develop incredible flavor from layering ingredients.

Arroz con pollo is also one of the dishes that the Spanish chef Jose Andres served in Hurricane Maria's wake. The chef, who famously served nearly four million meals on the island alongside thousands of volunteers, leaned on locals to inform what foods were prepared. The decision to serve arroz con pollo was practical, Mr. Andres said: It's a local dish, and the ingredients were available. It was also a comfort to those eating it. Flavor can't fix a crisis, but good food can nourish the body for whatever lies ahead. ""To me, a meal served after a disaster is not just about the calories or the nutrients, or where the ingredients come from,"" he said. ""It is about giving a sense of dignity and hope for the future.""

Those meals are also about ingenuity and resourcefulness. After Maria, the Nuyorican chef Cesar Perez, who's traveled back and forth to the island since childhood, called his friend Kelly Pirro, the chef at Mai Pen Rai, a Thai restaurant in San Juan, to see what they could do. ""She didn't have that much. Some chicken, some coconut milk,"" said Mr. Perez. ""And she's like, 'OK, I'll make a chicken coconut curry.' She had black beans, and I was like, 'OK, I'll make an arroz guisado'"" -- stewed, seasoned rice. ""There wasn't much, but it was delicious,"" he said. ""And we just packed up the calderos"" -- the pots -- ""in the back of her van, and we drove to Loiza. We stopped on the side of the road, and we just opened the trunk. And there was a point that there was a line of people."" Over the next seven months, Ms. Pirro and some collaborators distributed home-cooked meals across the island, ultimately forming a nonprofit group called Serve PR. When the coronavirus arrived, they fed hospitality workers, who have been particularly hard hit as the roller coaster of shifting restrictions -- including a law that prohibited alcohol sales after 7 p.m. -- has forced many bars and restaurants to close.

For decades, hurricane recovery has led Puerto Rican cooks to rely on imported nonperishable goods even more than they already do -- a legacy of U.S. policy. Local crops lost to storms only intensify the problem. Despite the island's biodiversity, an estimated 85 percent of the food in Puerto Rico is imported. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920, commonly known as the Jones Act, stipulates that all imported goods must be delivered on ships owned and operated by the United States, which limits the island's trade capacity and drives up food prices. In 1947, Operation Bootstrap industrialized the island, leading to an abrupt shift from agricultural production to manufacturing. But as much as those policies have had a negative impact on Puerto Rican agriculture, a few of the canned foods associated with them, like canned corned beef, Vienna sausages and Spam, are beloved by many on the island and have been absorbed by the cuisine. Crispy fried Spam has a hamlike smokiness and a pleasing texture. Islanders have long incorporated this ingredient into everyday dishes: Spam with eggs, Spam sandwiches, Spam with rice or Spam guisado with tomatoes, olives and potatoes. Following Maria, Spam macaroni and cheese emerged as a popular favorite -- both instant ingredients were included in some food-assistance boxes -- as did Spam-stuffed mofongo.

Still, Tara Rodriguez Besosa, one of the founders of El Departamento de la Comida, who uses gender-neutral pronouns, wants to support alternatives. The organization, which is dedicated to Puerto Rican food sovereignty, plans to work with local farmers to make sauces, pickles and other shelf staples, using ingredients from the farms. ""You know, the opposite of Goya,"" Mx. Rodriguez Besosa said. Soon after Covid-19 struck, the organization also distributed free local heirloom seeds across the island and started loaning out farm equipment, like plows and wood chippers.",Hardship and hurricanes have shaped the island's food for centuries. But chefs and home cooks make magic with whatever ingredients they have.,b920976d-8925-5c8c-8aee-727dc18f7f39,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/28/dining/26resilience1/26resilience1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=81386b771011adac8f3ef0a18873136d2e16fdf8dbfd330ad8202a3f31ca5609&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The chef Natalia Vallejo, at her home in Cayey, P.R., closed her San Juan restaurant, Cocina al Fondo, because of Covid-19.

Real Estate,Steve Berkowitz,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/realestate/commercial/steve-berkowitz.html,", 55, is the chief executive of Move Inc., a public company based in San Jose, Calif., that operates real estate Web sites for consumers and professionals, like Realtor.com and ListHub.com.  has been at the helm since 2009. Before joining Move, he ran the online business group of Microsoft, which included MSN.com, and was the chief executive of the online search engine Ask Jeeves.  also served as the president of IDG Books, where he helped expand the ""Dummies"" book series. Q. Does the National Association of Realtors have any involvement in Realtor.com? A. The brand is owned by them and licensed to us in perpetuity. But we operate the site and get all the revenue for the site. We do all the data, from rentals to new homes to listings to estimates to user-generated content. We get information from the Multiple Listing Services.

Q. Are you making an effort to get more New York City listings? A. Absolutely. The National Association of Realtors didn't allow us to take listings from nonmember-controlled M.L.S.'s, but we can now do that. So you're going to see us being very aggressive. In New York, for example, we're actually talking with the Corcoran Group and lots of the large brokerages to get their listings onto Realtor.com. They always wanted to have access to the audience. This market is a one-sided market. I grew up thinking the best way to find an apartment in New York was to talk to the doorman. Q. New York is a tough market to crack. A. You have to go to the listing agent to buy the home. It's just been that way. I don't know if they're going to change their financial arrangements, but I think they're looking to get access to the audience. Q. How much of the market nationwide are you getting over all? A. We believe we have 98 percent of the coverage in the country of M.L.S. listings, which represent a large portion of all listings, with the exception of the New York City market. We literally get 15-minute updates from 90 percent of the M.L.S.'s in the United States. So we have the single most current set of listing data.

On our mobile apps, we literally show when a house changes status, from on the market to pending sale. Q. There have been many changes in the way homes are viewed since Realtor.com came online several years ago. A. What's clear from consumers' point of view is that pictures are important, so we actually help Realtors. We do a lot of training; we have seminars on how to take the best photos; we also help them understand how to take videos. We're in the process of looking at different ways to use the mobile devices to allow people to literally upload photos. One of the more advanced areas that we'll be expanding our site into this year is the new-homes area. We have a site called NewHomeSource.com where you can literally change the colors of the rooms. That kind of technology will continue to move into the real estate space. Eventually we'd hope to be able to say to a consumer: You're looking at this house, what would it look like if you remodeled the kitchen? That'll be on Realtor.com at some point. Q. So your goal is to go beyond the listings and make the site much easier to use. A. Absolutely. One of the things we're looking at is to actually connect the property history with the house, so that we can show consumers a timeline view. We also talked about bringing in the home-improvement history and see who are the contractors that worked on a home. There are companies out there trying to aggregate these diverse sources of data.

Realtors are realizing that their role is moving beyond content. Their job is actually to bring the content together and become that trusted adviser to the consumer. Q. And with mobile apps, too? A. We use a lot of geographic location-based tools. On our mobile apps, if you're driving around the neighborhood and you press the button, it will literally show you things. We can show you right where you're standing, all the houses around where you're standing. You can draw a circle on our applications and literally say, I'd like to live on this street. Fifty percent of our traffic comes from mobile today. We have about six apps available; we update them every month. Q. Some might say you're playing catch-up with sites like Zillow or Trulia. A. No. We've been around since 1996, and so our focus has always been on the homes-for-sale side of the business. Zillow and Trulia are trying to catch up to us there. But we're actually trying to move back up the funnel. We really have to focus on bringing the Realtor brand back to consumers. A. We provide that in 70 markets, which cover about 45 percent of the coverage in the U.S. We're just bringing Boston up. We have quite a few in Florida. We get sold data within 15 minutes of the house selling. It'll tell you what agent listed the house, what agent sold the house. It was introduced about a year ago, and we're working very closely with the M.L.S.'s to expand. Q. What do you do for fun? A. I stay up late waiting for my 21-year-old to come home, and then I get up really early for the 7-year-old.","Mr. Berkowitz is the chief executive of Move Inc., a public company based in San Jose, Calif., that operates real estate Web sites for consumers and professionals, like Realtor.com and ListHub.com.",28f94c72-3904-53e0-944b-8818be5413e0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/16/business/INTERVIEW/INTERVIEW-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=781&w=600&s=60472de490ea5814948df387d13daf6425d4e627affa989b4f9c55ac2c1e4388&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Mr. Berkowitz,28f94c72-3904-53e0-944b-8818be5413e0,N24News/imgs/28f94c72-3904-53e0-944b-8818be5413e0.jpg,7
Science,Lessons in the Delicate Art of Confronting Offensive Speech,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/science/donald-trump-billy-bush-offensive-speech.html,"What if Billy Bush had just changed the subject? As unlikely as that may sound to anyone who has heard the infamous 2005 tape of Donald J. Trump boasting about sexually accosting women to the chuckling encouragement of Mr. Bush, an ""Access Hollywood"" host at the time, it just might have stifled the celebrity billionaire. A body of psychological research shows that even mild pushback against offensive remarks can have an instant effect -- as difficult as that can be, especially with a boss, a friend or a celebrity. It is research worth considering in a political season when ethnic, racist and sexual slurs, not to mention general insults, seem to have become part of everyday chatter. Polls show that people are increasingly unhappy with the tenor of the national debate but unsure what to do about the decline in civility. Researchers have detailed the difficulty of confronting prejudice, but they have also found that even the politest of objections -- or subtle corrections to loaded words -- can almost instantly curb a speaker's behavior. With a clearer understanding of the dynamics of such confrontation, psychologists say, people can develop tactics that can shut down the unsavory talk without ruining relationships, even when the offender has more status or power: a fraternity president, say, or a team captain or employer.

The alternative is passive complicity, psychologists say. ""When we hear this egregious, uncomfortable talk and we don't speak up, what's actually happening is that the person speaking is getting a green light,"" said Sharyn J. Potter, co-director of the Prevention Innovations Research Center, at the University of New Hampshire. ""It encourages them."" It hardly takes a psychologist to explain the difficulty inherent in any such confrontation. ""Simply saying, 'I don't appreciate that comment,' or 'That's not cool' -- well, people aren't going to like you very much after that,"" said Linda Tropp, a professor of psychology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. ""But they do get defensive, and change their behavior quickly."" It is important to realize that you don't have to make a dramatic, principled stand. ""We don't want bystanders to think they have to fly in with their Superman cape,"" said Dr. Potter, who is also an associate professor of sociology. There are many approaches people can use to stop talk they find noxious, say experts in what is known as bystander education. Among them: distraction, such as abruptly changing the subject. ""Even in the locker room, guys can change the conversation, they can spray people with water, or crank up the music,"" Dr. Potter said. Rather than calling out the speaker and shaming him or her publicly, which can carry the risk of retaliation, you could make it about you. ""You could say: 'This is bothering me. One of my good friends was raped.'"" Dr. Potter said. ""If you put it on yourself, that might feel safer.""

Gail Stern, an educator and a co-founder of Catharsis Productions, which gives sexual violence prevention training on college campuses and in the military, said that one deft approach might be to assume that the speaker is being outrageous on purpose, and to respond with something like this: ""I love satire. It's so weird that people believe that for real and it's so cool you called that out."" She calls that tactic ""verbal aikido,"" after the Japanese martial art whose practitioners defend themselves by redirecting an opponent's attack. An essential component of bystander intervention training is to get participants to imagine their own responses to scenarios. The goal is to get people to arm themselves with approaches that feel natural and innate, rather than outfitting them with model scripts. ""If you have a plan in your head, then you can use it,"" Dr. Potter said. Psychologists who study the effects of such confrontation divide offensive behavior into two loose categories. One includes strangers acting out -- a mother who slaps a toddler, a boy who punches his girlfriend -- and bystanders, when they react, tend to do so viscerally and quickly. The other category includes offensive jokes or references among people who know one another, like friends or co-workers. In those cases, there are more gray areas, as well as personality factors to consider and often a relationship at stake. Objections, if they come, often take a little longer than bystander intervention does. Deborah Cameron, a professor of language and communication at the University of Oxford, said that sexual banter often takes place among men who are friends, and that ""the function of it is to promote bonding."" Men may feel that if they challenge conversation they find tasteless, or simply don't join in, ""they're spoiling the mood at a minimum and possibly putting their relationship to the group at risk,"" she said. And sometimes they worry that ""it will raise doubts about their masculinity or heterosexuality,"" or that they will become targets of bullying, said Ms. Cameron, author of ""The Myth of Mars and Venus: Do Men and Women Really Speak Different Languages?""

Yet subtle objections can stop people in midsentence, in some cases prompting later reflection, psychologists have found. In one type of experiment, for example, study participants guess the occupations of people based on a photograph and limited information, like ""spends most of his days walking the streets"" or ""does regular housework."" Most of these profiles are ethnically neutral. But some are ringers. The photo of a black man who ""walks the streets"" often prompts guesses of ""homeless"" rather than mail carrier; and a black woman who depends on money from the government gets identified as a welfare mom instead of a government employee or a student with loans. Then the researchers, under the guise of fellow participants, push back. ""We confront them in a variety of ways, sometimes harshly -- 'That's racist!' -- and sometimes much less so, appealing to equality: 'Shouldn't everyone be treated the same?'"" said Alexander Czopp, director of the Center for Cross-Cultural Research at Western Washington University. ""Depending on how the confrontation is done, the participants might show different levels of defensiveness and anger right away; but they usually show less race-based attitudes on tests we do later."" David Fleischer, director of the Los Angeles LGBT Center's Leadership Lab, often sends gay and transgender people into socially conservative districts to do face-to-face canvassing. ""We have to handle these situations all the time,"" said Mr. Fleischer, now canvassing in Cleveland. ""We are seeking out people who are prejudiced, and they're using offensive language. And if you correct that language, just use different words yourself, and your tone and demeanor are kind, people are very responsive, and you don't have to get into a screaming match."" In a recent study, Mr. Fleischer and other researchers found that this kind of canvassing can soften the views of some 10 percent of voters -- a large shift when it comes to political behavior, and one that has prompted wider training in such cordial, respectful ""correcting"" of language. Of course, most people never get any training; they make judgments on the fly, about costs, tactics and personal integrity. And some are more likely to speak up than others, new research suggests. Aneeta Rattan, an assistant professor of organizational behavior at the London Business School and Carol Dweck of Stanford found in a recent study that people who are optimistic and believe that others can change -- that a bigot, with time, can change stripes -- are more likely than the pessimists to say something. ""In that sense,"" Dr. Rattan said, ""this work suggests that your belief system about others can either be a barrier or a staircase where you can take that first step -- even if it's just saying, 'I disagree.'""","Many people are left speechless when a companion uses ethnic, sexist or racist slurs. But researchers say there are ways to cut such remarks short.",55c5ece9-65c2-5eca-a690-ab39cb44f670,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/13/science/12TALK-1476295047047/12TALK-1476295047047-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=26fc83e69940ff7b723663b6244d26da1bff4caeb05250f574d1d777e0cdc677&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Billy Bush, then with ""Access Hollywood,"" interviewing Donald J.

Food,What to Cook This Week,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/dining/what-to-cook-this-week-newsletter.html,"Good morning. It's always darkest before the dawn, et cetera, but I am sick of winter and really don't want to cook any more root vegetables this week. I want to toss fiddleheads in foaming butter, roast asparagus over an open fire, mess with new radishes, plop a bunch of crunchy watercress down next to a modest steak, then go look for warblers returning north from their winter breaks down south.

No? Not yet? Something has to give. I'll fry chicken, then, buttermilk-brined fried chicken (above) at that, and serve it with waffles into which I'll drift a cup or so of grated Cheddar, pretend that summer's on us just like that. (Heat some honey and butter on the stove, and shake into it a heap of red-pepper flakes. That makes a nice drizzle on both the chicken and the waffle.) To go with: Pickleback slaw and a few cold 'Gansetts.

That's my Sunday plan, at any rate, though if it's too much for you to consider this week, you could always downshift into Alison Roman's very simple and perfectly Sundayish recipe for skillet chicken potpie, under a store-bought puff-pastry crust. Delicious.

Monday is St. Joseph's Day for some, the feast of the stepfather, a Lenten celebration that called historically for Lenten meals: pasta with sardines and fennel, say, or cacio e pepe with peas and favas. Even if you're not observing, those recipes are great, and an easy way to enter the workweek dinner schedule. We don't need to eat meat every day, after all.","In these cold, dark days before spring, make some buttermilk fried chicken, and pair it with waffles, or a perfectly Sundayish chicken potpie.",1dd955f5-99f9-5bad-95cd-2da70dd238a9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/25/dining/25FRIED-CHICKEN/25FRIED-CHICKEN-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=7a95e898e409a658be79109f13237855536ecdec099d743872ab1d03cfe6d735&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Buttermilk fried chicken.,1dd955f5-99f9-5bad-95cd-2da70dd238a9,N24News/imgs/1dd955f5-99f9-5bad-95cd-2da70dd238a9.jpg,17

Opinion,A Pandemic Isn't a Reason to Abolish the SAT,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/opinion/coronavirus-test-optional-sat.html,"Because of the threat posed by the coronavirus pandemic, the College Board, which administers the SAT and Advanced Placement exams, has canceled spring and summer testing and raised the possibility of offering SATs online in the fall. The ACT is considering a similar approach. In response, over the last several weeks numerous colleges and universities, including Tulane, Swarthmore, the University of Washington and the University of California system, have announced that they will no longer require the SAT or ACT for 2021 applicants. Other institutions, including Tufts, say they plan to have ""test optional"" policies for at least three years. These decisions are being made in the context of immediate concerns about student safety. But they are also part of a larger debate around standardized testing, led by both student and adult education activists who question the extent to which these tests are predictive of college success. The truth, these critics say, is that standardized tests are nothing but a measure of wealth, prep and cultural capital. In 2017, the International Association for College Admission Counseling, which represents nearly 3,000 school counselors, said it had lost confidence in the College Board and the ACT. And an article in March in The Washington Post asked, ""Is it finally time to get rid of the SAT and ACT college admissions tests?""

Both the SAT and ACT are definitely flawed: There is gaming of the exams by the wealthy, most egregiously evident in last year's Varsity Blues scandal. And on a legal, more commonplace level, endlessly prepped and tutored upper-middle-class students can engineer better scores. Researchers have found that SAT scores correlate positively to higher parental income levels, which is no surprise given that coaching costs hundreds if not thousands of dollars. These are wholly legitimate concerns. Still, that doesn't mean we should get rid of the ACT and the SAT right now or see the coronavirus crisis as an opportune time to bury use of standardized tests for good. There is plenty of merit in considering how to redesign these exams to be better and more inclusive. For now, however, these standardized tests may be more democratic and accessible than many of the other metrics used to evaluate applicants. To make a loose political analogy, ""Democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried."" Again, this is not a defense of the status quo, but rather a plea to deeply consider what colleges will weigh more heavily if they don't consider standardized tests in their admissions decisions. Their alternative considerations will often be even more exclusionary than the status quo. Especially if the College Board is unable to address internet access inequities by fall. Think of it like this: Consider that good grades from a struggling public school in Mississippi could be discounted by admissions officers and scholarship committees compared with good grades coming from an elite private or public magnet school that offers AP courses and an honors curriculum.

These generalized, unfair distinctions, which are often a result of socioeconomic biases, can often be overcome by the counterweight of strong standardized test scores from students in public schools perceived as middling or underperforming. The tests are, yes, an imperfect counterweight -- with their own historical bias toward white normativity, among other issues. But grades and standardized test scores are two of the only remotely ""objective"" measures of performance that our brilliant pupils of all backgrounds have. To remove the SAT or the ACT, now or later, could jeopardize these students' chances rather than provide them with a more even playing field.

Without standardized tests, the other most common components of a student's college application include aspects that may only worsen inequities: the personal essays, the letters of recommendation from successful mentors, the calls from well-connected college counselors and the option to submit supplementary materials for certain academic scholarships. The personal essay is the chance many privileged students (and their tutors) take to reveal their unique attributes. The experiences that make them a ""desirable applicant."" This is where the perfectly crafted extracurriculars, the travel tales, the musical talent and the time at impressive unpaid internships come in. Beyond these specifics, there's something to be said for the student who is earnest but also savvy enough to know that writing about the local Facebook group organizing grocery runs to the elderly amid the pandemic would be a heart melter for admissions officers. And the tacit knowledge of what kind of supplements can give your application a boost. It's harder for students from low- and moderate-income households to finesse these strategies and access to resources, especially in the current climate.

Despite broad efforts across educational institutions, the college admissions processes over all -- not just the tests -- remain far from equitable. But until we are on the other side of this pandemic, with enough stability to meaningfully and structurally change the system, we can try to maximize the fairness of the variables that we can control. Regardless of whether the SAT and the ACT move online, our top priority should be to figure out a way for lower-income students to prepare for the tests, given that so many will be at home in possibly cramped living environments that are not amenable to studying. At the very least, companies like Kaplan and the Princeton Review ought to expand their free test prep extensively and offer their online courses to students free. (Khan Academy already offers some free SAT prep.) Nonprofits and educational institutions can get involved by lending computers -- perhaps with the exam already installed on them -- and providing free internet or cellular data to students below a certain income level, if only temporarily. There's already some evidence that maneuvers like these are possible. In response to college closures, the Foundation for the Los Angeles Community Colleges and the Leonetti O'Connell Foundation worked together with Human-I-T to provide thousands of refurbished Chromebooks and Wi-Fi connectivity to students who lacked access. The College Board could also design an exam that can be administered using a mobile phone or cellular data. Given the constrained schedules many students will face because of increased family responsibilities, some students may not have the three-hour time slot to take the exam all at once. The College Board may consider offering windows of dates to complete the exam instead.","For now, the SAT and ACT are more democratic than many of the other metrics used to evaluate college applicants.",abbf559d-9d8b-5326-9451-f5abc87a6619,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/01/opinion/01Halkett/01Halkett-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=7a3b9fe1528b2efea4074d7b9f23a0c57dca145b7ad82bc149df35cabf915753&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A student using a Princeton Review SAT Preparation book to study for the test.,abbf559d-9d8b-5326-9451-f5abc87a6619,N24News/imgs/abbf559d-9d8b-5326-9451-f5abc87a6619.jpg,11
Music,Breland Is Country. Breland Is Hip-Hop. Can Breland Go Pop?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/arts/music/breland-country-rap-my-truck.html,"In the video for Breland's breakout single, ""My Truck,"" the twangy sung intro is mouthed by a stoic Marlboro Man type. But then comes Breland, wiry and enthusiastic, shoving him out of the frame to take over the singing, providing an object lesson in genre and racial expectations. ""My Truck,"" one of the year's most beguiling singles, is a fluent amalgam of country verbiage and vocal texture with hip-hop bluster and cadence. ""Wood-grain dash with the matte-black finish,"" Breland sing-raps, ""and it match my shawty with the big ol' butt."" Breland made the song last September, in between writing R&B demos, as both an exercise and an inspired bit of strategy. ""I've had a Billboard Pro membership for years,"" he said recently in a FaceTime interview from his Atlanta home, wearing a shirt that read GODFIDENCE. ""I was aware of the fact that the biggest record of all time is a country-trap song by an unknown artist from Atlanta and now no one else is putting out songs that sound like that. Wide open. Why on earth would I not give it a shot?"" ""My Truck"" -- his first attempt -- manages to be playful without being kitsch, earnestly embracing the truck culture of the South while sprinkling in some frisky lyrics and arched-eyebrow meta-commentary about being a black performer in a traditionally white space: ""Scuff these Jordans/You can say you hate me."" It's a little bit of a dare from someone gleefully divebombing into rural aesthetics. ""I'm the fourth-wall breaker,"" Breland said. ""It is impossible for me to exist in this space and not acknowledge the fact that it's a little weird.""

Breland -- a 24-year-old genre-fluid pop-minded talent with a lithe singing voice and an instinctual ability to mimic Young Thug-esque flow patterns -- savvily jumped into that vacuum. On Friday he'll release his self-titled debut EP (on Bad Realm/Atlantic), full of breezy, intuitive songs that make light work of the borders between country, hip-hop, R&B and pop, including country-themed trap (""Horseride""), country-textured R&B (""Wifi"") and hip-hop-accented pop country (""In the Woulds,"" with the country singers Chase Rice and Lauren Alaina). It's a huge swing, and also utterly logical. Breland's approach is a successor to both the country rap tunes that dominated the South in the 1990s and 2000s and also the hip-hop-inflected country that's been a persistent presence in Nashville in the 2010s, best espoused by Sam Hunt (and less impressively by umpteen of his peers). Yet Breland, born Daniel Breland, wasn't raised in either of those traditions -- he grew up in a New Jersey household of gospel singers, and sang and arranged a cappella with a group called the Phantoms when he was in college at Georgetown. He started making his earliest inroads as a professional songwriter then, too, and during his sophomore year, he found himself working in Far Rockaway, at the home of the French Montana affiliate Chinx (formerly Chinx Drugz). One night, Breland recalled, ""He left and said, 'I'm going to go do this show.'""

He never came back: Chinx had been murdered. ""That let me know that hip-hop probably wasn't going to be for me,"" Breland said. ""I don't think that I'm really cut out to be in the trenches like that."" After graduation, Breland moved to Atlanta and began writing predominantly R&B songs, around 2,000 in three years, he estimates, with only flickers of success. But he was diligent, and also impressive enough of a singer that when he posted Chris Brown covers, Brown would sometimes repost them. He got used to sharing snippets of new work on his Instagram story, which is where he first posted the ""My Truck"" hook, and received encouragement to release it on his own. ""'My Truck' can be a very polarizing song,"" Breland said. ""The question for me to answer was, 'Do I believe that I could pull this song off?' And then the answer that I had was: 'Why not, right? Why not me?'"" Since then, he's doubled down on the sound. He worked with the Nashville-based Sam Sumser and Sean Small, who've written and produced for Lizzo and Usher, and also Mitchell Tenpenny and Walker Hayes. ""You don't know if it's a joke, playing off the current craze, the country-trap thing; we went into it hoping it was more sincere than just a one-song thing,"" said Sumser, who along with Small worked on two songs on the EP, ""Hot Sauce"" and ""In the Woulds."" ""This kid is way more than a quick meme."" (Charlie Handsome, who has produced for Post Malone, Kanye West and Khalid, produced on two songs as well.)

""I really knew from hearing 'My Truck' that he was talented, but being in the room with him, it was another level,"" Hunt said in a phone interview. One of the ideas they kicked around was a ""My Truck"" remix with Hunt on it. Over the next few weeks, Hunt wrote several verses, and settled on two, including lyrics that are, Hunt said, ""as far into rural country as I've ever gone"": ""Toolbox full of dirty dove-shot empties, muddy old clodhoppers and a Mossberg pump/Pull up on you at the red light, homie, throw some Bone Thugs on and make your loose change jump."" For the video, he bought the kind of pickup truck he had in mind when writing the verse, a 1993 Chevrolet C/K 1500 4x4. Part of the excitement of the song -- in addition to hearing Hunt sing Breland's boast, ""Young, rich and I'm pretty"" -- is hearing Hunt, a syrupy country singer, lean into the melodies and patterns Breland established, a proof-of-concept for more aggressive blends of country, R&B and hip-hop on the horizon. The original ""My Truck"" had early support from 97.9 The Box (KBXX-FM), Houston's influential hip-hop station. ""This sounds like Houston, it sounds like our station,"" said Terri Thomas, its program director, who had reached out to Breland via Instagram direct message within minutes of hearing ""My Truck"" in early February. When they spoke later that day, Thomas said, ""I told him, 'By the end of the day, you're going to be the new priority at the label.'"" The song has since been played widely throughout the South, where truck culture is gospel.

Much of the balancing act for Breland moving forward involves courting both sides. He has two managers -- one from the world of hip-hop and R&B, one from country. The coronavirus pandemic led him to cancel his promotional tour, a frustration for John McMann, Atlantic's senior vice president of pop and rhythmic promotion, who was keen to get the effervescent Breland in rooms with radio decision makers: ""He's the textbook built artist to do the promo game, go from market to market and break down the doors,"" McMann said. Instead of a tour, Breland did Instagram Live performances for more than 50 radio stations while locked down with his family in New Jersey, where he was originally quarantining. And he opened up a contest for songwriters to contribute verses to ""In the Woulds."" He posts comedic videos on TikTok, including ""How to Make a Drake Song in 1 Minute"" and one, for ""Horseride,"" in which he stands on his father's back as he crawls across the living room floor. ""The one thing that I didn't want to do was lose steam,"" Breland said. ""You know how music is -- the sounds change every six months, for real.""","The 24-year-old's single ""My Truck"" is the most viable fusion of rural and urban since ""Old Town Road,"" and his new EP pushes the sound even further.",47f18a0f-805e-5aa2-87ad-22dfa616df35,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/20/arts/20breland1/20breland1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=15080c9d7635a9c9dc40d7d08f9cfeaf5a38f4e95ce5a4acfb4641d794401ca6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""It is impossible for me to exist in this space and not acknowledge the fact that it's a little weird,"" Breland said.",47f18a0f-805e-5aa2-87ad-22dfa616df35,N24News/imgs/47f18a0f-805e-5aa2-87ad-22dfa616df35.jpg,12
Technology,Russia Tests New Disinformation Tactics in Africa to Expand Influence,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/technology/russia-facebook-disinformation-africa.html,"Russia has been testing new disinformation tactics in an enormous Facebook campaign in parts of Africa, as part of an evolution of its manipulation techniques ahead of the 2020 American presidential election. Facebook said on Wednesday that it removed three Russian-backed influence networks on its site that were aimed at African countries including Mozambique, Cameroon, Sudan and Libya. The company said the online networks were linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Russian oligarch who was indicted by the United States and accused of interfering in the 2016 presidential election. Unlike past influence campaigns from Russia, the networks targeted several countries through Arabic-language posts, according to the Stanford Internet Observatory, which collaborated with Facebook to unravel the effort. Russians also worked with locals in the African countries to set up Facebook accounts that were disguised as authentic to avoid detection. Some of the posts promoted Russian policies, while others criticized French and American policies in Africa. A Facebook page set up by the Russians in Sudan that masqueraded as a news network, called Sudan Daily, regularly reposted articles from Russia's state-owned Sputnik news organization.

The effort was at times larger in volume than what the Russians deployed in the United States in 2016. While the Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency posted on Facebook 2,442 times a month on average in 2016, one of the networks in Africa posted 8,900 times in October alone, according to the Stanford researchers. ""They are trying to make it harder for us and civil society to try and detect their operations,"" Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy, said of the Russian actions. The campaign underlined how Russia is continuing to aggressively try different disinformation techniques, even as it has come under scrutiny for its online interference methods. By spreading the use of its tactics to a region that is less closely monitored than the United States and Europe, researchers said Russia appeared to be trying to expand its sphere of influence in Africa, where it has started distributing propaganda and building a political infrastructure. Alex Stamos, director of the Stanford Internet Observatory and a former Facebook executive, said the campaign had implications for the United States ahead of next year's presidential election. He said it was highly likely that Russian groups were already using the same model of working with locals in the United States to post inflammatory messages on Facebook. By employing locals, he said, Russians did not need to set up fake accounts or create accounts that originated in Russia, making it easier to sidestep being noticed.

For Facebook, the evolution of Russia's disinformation techniques means it cannot afford to lose vigilance. The Silicon Valley company faced a barrage of criticism after Russians abused the social network in 2016 to plant divisive content to influence the American electorate. Since then, Facebook has set up war rooms and hired more security experts to head off foreign interference in elections. But Russia has kept up a steady stream of influence efforts on Facebook. Last week, the company revealed it had taken down four state-backed disinformation campaigns, three from Iran and one of which started in Russia. Facebook is dealing with other issues related to the 2020 election. For weeks, it has been under attack by presidential candidates, lawmakers and even its own employees over how it treats political advertising. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, has said he will allow politicians to post any claims they want in an ad -- even if they are false -- in the name of free expression. Facebook faces a difficult adversary in Russia. The country had previously indicated that its disinformation techniques were changing and that it was aiming to work with locals on online influence campaigns. In Ukraine, which held a presidential election this year, local authorities announced in March that they had arrested a Russian agent in the capital, Kiev. The agent, they said, had been ordered by his Russian handlers to ""find people in Ukraine on Facebook who wanted to sell their accounts or temporarily rent them out.""

The latest campaign in Africa is the first well-documented case of Russia ""franchising,"" or outsourcing, its disinformation efforts to local parties, said Facebook and the Stanford researchers. It's unusual for a nation to try to influence so many countries at once, they said. Shelby Grossman, one of the Stanford researchers, said that Russians in some cases set up local media organizations in the African countries to employ locals who would post the propaganda and false content on Facebook. In other cases, the Russians hired existing media groups to do so. Facebook said it was unclear specifically when the Russian activity in Africa started because the Russians took over some existing pages on the social network. But the posts ramped up last year when the influence networks bought Facebook ads. In total, the networks spent more than $87,000 on Facebook ads. The networks often posted about political news, including elections in Madagascar and Mozambique. They sought to drive Facebook users from the platform and into public groups on WhatsApp and Telegram, which are encrypted messaging apps, to increase interaction. And they used Facebook Live videos, Google Forms and quizzes to draw people into their Facebook pages and groups. Some of the Facebook pages pushing Russian disinformation were not sophisticated. A cluster of pages posing as Libyan news entities posted about Libyan issues, but the page managers were in Egypt, the Netherlands, Germany and other countries, said the Stanford researchers. Some of the pages experienced unnatural jumps in followers and other telltale signs of inauthentic behavior. Mr. Gleicher said some of the Russian-run pages and groups also used compromised Facebook accounts that once belonged to real people but had been stolen and repurposed by hackers. He said that Facebook is still building out its automated systems for detecting compromised accounts, so the company still misses some and pulls in its investigative team to catch them. Facebook said its investigation had ""connected these campaigns to entities associated with"" Mr. Prigozhin, but the company declined to say how. Mr. Prigozhin controlled the entity that financed Russia's Internet Research Agency.",Facebook said it removed three Russian-backed influence networks aimed at African countries. The activity by the networks suggested Russia's approach was evolving.,d1824151-4fdb-564b-b327-a8d497146cc5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/31/business/31-RUSSIADISINFO-01-print/30RUSSIADISINFO-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=7b7b540906d1dad212c56147931f74bbd439d3ee44472403441bd74d5eb48990&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Radio Africa Facebook page, which masqueraded as a news page in Sudan, was part of a Russian-backed influence network in central and northern Africa.",d1824151-4fdb-564b-b327-a8d497146cc5,N24News/imgs/d1824151-4fdb-564b-b327-a8d497146cc5.jpg,20
Dance,An Artist Who Blurs Bodies and Genres in Protest,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/14/arts/dance/an-artist-okwui-okpokwasili-who-blurs-bodies-and-genres-in-protest.html,"When Okwui Okpokwasili talks about her work, she treats each question like a knot to be unraveled, physically as much as verbally. Emphatic gestures punctuate her sentences, or complete them, as if movement might summon the answer. ""I want to fall apart, just enough,"" she said recently over coffee near her Brooklyn home, discussing her approach to performing and making performance. Her palms opened like the pages of a book, suggesting a blank slate, or a readiness for anything. ""And there's this hope that something else can come through -- I don't know what."" If you've seen Ms. Okpokwasili onstage -- in her own genre-blurring work or in that by dance and theater artists like Ralph Lemon, Dean Moss and Young Jean Lee -- you probably know what she means. Nearly six feet tall, with a hypnotic voice and limbs that swallow up space, she pushes herself to the edge as a performer, playing with extremes of ecstasy, sadness or rage with almost dangerous intensity. Her Bessie Award-winning ""Bronx Gothic,"" a fiercely intimate solo inspired by her Bronx upbringing (and the subject of a new documentary coming to Film Forum in July), began with her trembling to the point of near exhaustion. In Mr. Lemon's 2010 ""How Can You Stay in the House All Day and Not Go Anywhere?"" she spent part of each performance in tears.

It's a certain kind of getting lost. ""I'm looking for mysteries, looking for some useful confusion,"" she said. While that goes for all of her work as a choreographer, writer, performer and director, Ms. Okpokwasili, 44, was referring to her latest, ""Poor People's TV Room,"" which begins a two-week run at New York Live Arts on Wednesday, April 19.

A collaboration with her husband and longtime creative partner, Peter Born, also 44, the project grew out of her interest in resistance movements propelled by women, black women in particular, and the body as a site of protest. Exploring themes of memory and invisibility, Ms. Okpokwasili, who is Nigerian-American, is joined by three women ranging in age from their late 20s to late 60s. (The oldest is the South African singer and Olivier Award-winning Broadway actress Thuli Dumakude.) A meeting of dance, text, song, video and installation (Ms. Okpokwasili cringes at talk of disciplinary categories), ""Poor People's TV Room"" is even more elusive, in terms of genre and story, than her previous works. Asked if there's a narrative, she replied, ""Kind of, -ish.""

Since its inception almost three years ago, as a 50-minute song that she performed in Lincoln Center's David Rubenstein Atrium, the piece has passed through multiple iterations (and grown closer to 90 minutes), including performances in January at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, which commissioned the work with Live Arts and Lumberyard. ""I think she doesn't want it to be too legible in a concrete, narrative sense,"" said Philip Bither, the Walker's senior performing arts curator. ""It has a certain logic, but it's very hallucinatory, very dreamlike and surreal, and I think that's all intentional."" While the results may be porous, Ms. Okpokwasili pinpoints two specific sources of inspiration. In 2014 she became fascinated by the Bring Back Our Girls movement, the international response to the kidnapping of nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls by the terrorist group Boko Haram. She found it troubling that as the demand became a viral hashtag, touted by celebrities around the world, people lost sight of the movement's originators, the mothers of the girls. To Ms. Okpokwasili the phenomenon seemed to reflect ""how the cultural contributions of black women, African women, have been erased,"" she said in an email. ""So I wanted to begin a kind of uncovering, for myself."" That brought her to an earlier instance of Nigerian women's resistance, the Women's War of 1929, in which thousands of Ibo women from southeastern Nigeria opposed the threat of taxes from British colonizers. Their struggle was known in the Ibo language as ""egwu,"" which means dance, and involved protest tactics rooted in the body, like older women baring their breasts in front of government officials. While Ms. Okpokwasili's initial inspirations may not be obvious in the final piece, they informed the questions that run through it and that she continues to ask. ""What is it, my interest in brown bodies and brown women performing?"" she said. ""It's about a staking of presence, of place, but how to do that in a way that doesn't further entrench practices that diminish them?""

Working as collaboratively as they do has taken time and space. In a phone interview, Mr. Born said the two had enjoyed ""the luxury"" of several residencies where they could assemble the work's many moving parts (a process that, under other circumstances, might be confined to a few rushed days). The most substantial was a two-year residency at Live Arts, one of the country's most coveted opportunities for choreographers, offering a full salary, health insurance, production funds and other resources. ""I get to wake up in the morning and just think about the piece,"" Mr. Born said. ""I don't have to go be a P.A., I don't have to help load a truck. I did that for many years."" At a rehearsal two weeks before the New York premiere, the work was still in flux, with the script being tweaked, lines relearned and differences hashed out. Both Ms. Okpokwasili and Mr. Born, who is white and grew up in Madison, Wis., said that argument is a driving force in their process. Many of their debates have revolved around the role of ""spoken tongue language,"" as Ms. Okpokwasili calls it, versus the work's physical language, which at times suggests a body breaking into pieces or striving to keep another body alive. ""There's something so essential communicated by how these women are moving with each other that sometimes we're like, is the language superfluous?"" Mr. Born said of the script, which he and Ms. Okpokwasili wrote together. Ms. Okpokwasili added, ""Our fights over what the text is, or who gets to place this language in these bodies, have become kind of complicated.""","Okwui Okpokwasili, a magnetic performer, choreographer and writer returns with a long-gestating new work, ""Poor People's TV Room,"" at New York Live Arts.",a390e667-a228-564a-b1ed-99c9fb3dfbf3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/08/arts/16okwui-1/16okwui-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=8ffd7bd42bf3ff611aca7759c51c46795b8b1fd0943ccaf54331db6d7870c331&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Okwui Okpokwasili, whose new work, ""Poor People's TV Room,"" is the culmination of a two-year residency at New York Live Arts.",a390e667-a228-564a-b1ed-99c9fb3dfbf3,N24News/imgs/a390e667-a228-564a-b1ed-99c9fb3dfbf3.jpg,6
Travel,Celebrating July 4 — in South America,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/15/travel/celebrating-july-4-in-south-america.html,"Instead of a stateside getaway for the long July 4 weekend, why not get into a different kind of American spirit by heading to South America?

Theater,"'Magic Mike' Heads for the Stage, as a Broadway-Bound Musical Starting in Boston",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/theater/magic-mike-broadway-musical-boston.html,"""Magic Mike"" could always dance. Now he's going to sing.

The seductive stripper saga, born as a film in 2012, is now the basis of a new stage musical that will have a first production in Boston starting this fall, the producers said Thursday.

The stage show is being billed as a prequel to the film -- whereas the film told the story of an established stripper, Mike Lane, who trains a new recruit named Adam, the stage musical will tell the story of how Mike Lane became a stripper. (This is how a news release describes the show's narrative tension: ""Can Mike follow his dreams without losing more than his clothes?"")

Magic Mike is already a bit of an empire. The 2012 film, which was a hit, spawned a sequel, ""Magic Mike XXL,"" and a nightclub show, ""Magic Mike Live,"" that began in Las Vegas and is now also running in London. All told, the brand has already sold more than $335 million in tickets, the producers said.

[Check out our Culture Calendar here.]

The stage musical will feature an original score by Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey, who won the Pulitzer Prize and a Tony Award for ""Next to Normal.""

Automobiles,Tripleheader to Open Show Season,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/automobiles/autoshow/tripleheader-to-open-show-season.html,"As 2013 is winding down, a fresh season of auto shows is booting up. Three big international salons -- in Los Angeles, Tokyo and Guangzhou, China -- are opening this week more or less on top of one another. The potential complications for automakers, as they struggle to allocate manpower, budgets and new models over a tripleheader of shows stretching across 17 time zones, is staggering. But at least one company, Jaguar, is trying to have some fun with it, introducing its new F-Type Coupe at a press preview on Tuesday evening in Los Angeles -- at the same time it unveils the car to the press in Tokyo, where it will be lunchtime on Wednesday. The conflicts play out this way: Press previews for both the Tokyo and Los Angeles shows are scheduled for Wednesday, but because of the time difference Tokyo's Wednesday has a 17-hour head start. That's why Jaguar scheduled its Los Angeles program for Tuesday night.

Automakers are approaching the conflicts with different solutions. Lexus, the luxury brand that Toyota first introduced in America a generation ago, is unveiling cars in Tokyo and Guangzhou, but not in Los Angeles. Infiniti, which is not sold in Japan, does have its logo on a new Skyline model being introduced by Nissan -- but not wearing the Nissan name -- in Tokyo. Confused? You're not alone. The Los Angeles show promises world premieres of nearly two dozen new models during its two days of previews, as well as a design competition. The Tokyo show, which underwent a severe downsizing in recent years as a result of the recession, is showcasing a mixed bag of new cars, trucks, farm equipment, motorcycles and power equipment. The upstart Guangzhou show, which aspires to become a major international event like its larger counterparts in Beijing and Shanghai, has more modest ambitions. Sorting through the hoopla being broadcast by organizers of this global three-ring circus, here is some of what the major automakers have in mind. Unless otherwise noted, the introductions will take place in Los Angeles. AUDI Showcasing its A3 line of small cars, Audi will highlight an E-tron plug-in hybrid version. BMW Plans include the debuts of the 4 Series Convertible and the Concept X4.

FORD What is said to be the 2015 Edge crossover will be displayed as a design study. GENERAL MOTORS General Motors is having twins: the new Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon midsize pickups arrive. HONDA A fuel-cell E.V. concept will be shown in Los Angeles. In Tokyo, there's a cute Kei-class miniroadster that, sadly, is not headed to the United States. JAGUAR The F-Type Coupe and a crossover concept, the C-X17, will be introduced. KIA The luxury sedan presented earlier in Europe as the K9 and Quoris has a new name, the K900. LEXUS Two design studies, the RC Coupe and the latest LF-NX, arrive in Tokyo.

Opinion,How Many Covid Deaths? Don't Ask President Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/17/opinion/coronavirus-us-death-toll.html,"The fatality numbers are, to be sure, heartbreaking: more than 85,000 Americans dead and more than 1.4 million infected. But many public health experts, including some within the Trump administration, have been stressing that, if anything, Covid-19 deaths and cases are being undercounted.

Appearing before a Senate committee on Tuesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert and a key member of the president's coronavirus task force, told lawmakers that the real death toll was ""almost certainly higher"" than the official count. (The hearing was conducted virtually because Dr. Fauci, two other members of the task force who were testifying and the committee's chairman, Senator Lamar Alexander, were all self-quarantining after possible exposure to the virus.)

Despite this, President Trump and some top administration officials seem to suspect that the number of Covid-19 deaths is being overstated. Debate over the accuracy of the data being put out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has become a hot topic at the White House, according to reporting this week from Axios, to the point that the task force is reassessing the mortality numbers as part of ""a much larger review of data quality issues,"" an administration official told The Times.

The White House needs to be transparent about this review and about any underlying concerns. Understanding how many Americans this disease has claimed is vital to organizing the response to it -- and to honoring those lost to it. Like so much about the pandemic, questions about the death toll have become a source of public confusion and partisan friction -- one that the president has done nothing to tamp down.",The president has expressed skepticism about the fatality figures reported to him by his own experts.,faac575c-f819-5928-bf8e-0894f290a015,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/18/opinion/18deathtoll1/17deathtoll1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=128e986a609e1078e3117bbd7aa90aeac6bce9db7e627ceee431157f9219853e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A body is moved into a van outside of Bronx Lebanon Hospital Center in the Bronx, NY last month.",faac575c-f819-5928-bf8e-0894f290a015,N24News/imgs/faac575c-f819-5928-bf8e-0894f290a015.jpg,11
Dance,Review: Sara Baras in a Flamenco Whirlwind,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/06/arts/dance/review-sara-baras-in-a-flamenco-whirlwind.html,"In ""Voces, Suite Flamenca,"" the Spanish flamenco star Sara Baras pays tribute to six luminaries of her art who have influenced her. Their likenesses appear on mobile flats that suggest monumental headstones. Their voices can be heard in recordings, expounding in Spanish on the meaning of flamenco. Live singers and guitarists add resonant voices of their own. That most of the show rings hollow is the fault of Ms. Baras.

Don't tell that to her fans, especially those who enthusiastically greeted the United States premiere of ""Voces"" at City Center on Wednesday. The professions of love exchanged between Ms. Baras and her vocal public were the most over-the-top aspect of the show.

I can see grounds for admiration. Ms. Baras is a highly controlled, finely etched dancer. Her curling wrists, serpentine arms and scorpion shapes are fatally precise. In taut turns, she whips around with a startling swiftness, an angry snap. She can swirl a skirt vividly and cut a handsome figure in slacks. Her thunderous, turbo footwork (highly amplified) is indisputably impressive. At the climax of every number, her jackhammering heels propel her like a locomotive.

But all this flash covers a preening emptiness. The most revealing moment in ""Voces"" comes when the images of the honorees are turned to face the rear so that Ms. Baras can be surrounded by mirrors.","Sara Baras pays tributes to six of the greats of her art form in her program ""Voces, Suite Flamenca.""",9b60c564-39eb-5b0e-a8d4-811484c1341b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/06/arts/06VOCES/06VOCES-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=68140437054bff58502f0789909d5f835d3a8b5fa178d5f31904e268741ad9f0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sara Baras wears a three-layered dress in the solo ""Soleá por Bulería,"" part of her show, ""Voces, Suite Flamenca,"" at City Center.",9b60c564-39eb-5b0e-a8d4-811484c1341b,N24News/imgs/9b60c564-39eb-5b0e-a8d4-811484c1341b.jpg,6
Art & Design,Poland Urged to Look for Nazi-Looted Art Still Held in Its Museums,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/12/arts/design/poland-nazi-looted-art.html,"The systemic looting of Poland by the Nazis during World War II still resonates today in that country, where officials continue to seek the return of more than 63,000 works of art and cultural properties, many of which were stolen from Jews there. But experts say Poland has done a poor job of providing the same justice to Dutch Jews and others whose art works were stolen during the war and ended up in German-occupied Poland and now are part of official museum collections. Seven Dutch works that researchers have identified as missing are held by one museum in Gdansk. Scholars say they suspect dozens more are in art institutions in other Polish cities where the Nazis stored cultural artifacts they had looted, or bought under dubious circumstances, from the Netherlands. ""The Polish government wants to have as much as possible back,"" said Kamil Zeidler, a law professor at the University of Gdansk who has studied the issue, ""but they don't want to give anything back to others.""

For example, according to a report prepared in 2018 but never publicly released, 81 works seized in the Netherlands by the Nazis or their agents most likely ended up in occupied Poland. The report, by the Origins Unknown Agency, a Dutch organization that investigates cases of looted art, was commissioned by the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany. But the Polish museums and authorities have not done much to track the works, the researchers said. ""There is no commitment at a museum level, or at a national level, or at a political level to return these works that are in the country,"" said Anne Webber, the founder and co-chair of the Commission for Looted Art in Europe, a London-based nonprofit that helps to foster restitutions.

""Poland still lacks a viable procedure for processing restitution claims from Holocaust victims both within the country and from abroad,"" Ms. Grimsted wrote in an article to be published in the International Journal of Cultural Property. In response to questions from The New York Times, curators at the Gdansk museum acknowledged that six other paintings in their collections are also identified on the Origins Unknown Agency's list of missing Dutch works thought to be in Poland. In addition to the van Goyen, the art includes paintings attributed to Pieter de Hooch and Ferdinand Bol. One of the works, by Jacob van Ruysdael, was taken from a Jewish publisher in Berlin, German researchers found, and ended up in the hands of Dutch art dealers who appear to have sold it to the museum in Gdansk. Willi Drost, the director of the Gdansk art museum during the war, was an avid buyer of Dutch old master paintings, according to the Origins Unknown Agency report. Magda Mielnik, curator of the historical art department at the Gdansk museum, said she and her colleagues are working to document the history and provenance of the collection with a plan to publish a book about all the works next year. ""The paintings looted from the Netherlands are an important part of our research,"" she said. Frank Lord, a New York-based lawyer for the Goudstikker heirs, said the family believes two works in the museum are from the Dutch art dealer's collection. He declined to discuss any plans to seek their return.

The Polish government, the statement said, only responds to claims that are placed before it through ""an official government procedure on the basis of international law."" Individual claimants, it noted, could also pursue restitution through the courts. The Dutch Ministry of Culture said restitution claims should be filed by individuals, not the state. ""Should a Dutch citizen need help from the Dutch state, they will receive the required support,"" said Martijn Kamans, a ministry spokesman, in an email. Dutch museums have also confronted criticism that they have not done enough to return works of art to owners who lost them during World War II. As frustrating as Polish efforts have been to outside researchers, inside the country there is a broad sense that people beyond Poland's borders need to recognize the scale of the losses in that country, where millions died and some 500,000 cultural objects went missing during the war.

""We have to stress and we need to mention that Poland as a country was a victim and probably was the biggest victim of the Second World War concerning the looting of cultural property,"" said Professor Zeidler. At conferences on the restitution of art looted during the Holocaust, an adviser to the State Department, Stuart E. Eizenstat, has identified Poland as one of several countries that have failed to live up to the 1998 Washington Principles, which set requirements for international cooperation in returning plundered art. Mr. Eizenstat said in an interview last month that he considered it urgent that the Polish and Dutch authorities form a joint working group to try to identify and return the dozens of artworks that have already been tracked to Poland. ""But more broadly,"" he said, it would help if Poland undertook ""a thoroughgoing provenance research project to determine whether or not they are holding other Nazi-looted art, not that they took, but that migrated to Poland in one way or another."" Just as important, he added, is that other countries access the Polish database of its war losses to ensure the return of ""any of those objects taken from within Poland's World War II borders."" The database created by Dutch researchers lists some 15,000 works still missing from the Netherlands, though experts call that a partial count.

Some of this art was later sold through dealers or auction houses in Poland under the control of the German Reich. ""The Germans used the Polish museums as depositories for looted art,"" explained Ms. Webber. Ms. Grimsted said a group of paintings from the Netherlands ended up in Gdansk through Albert Forster, the Nazi governor who targeted Jews and other Poles for death ""while promoting Nazi art preferences in the local museum, which became a gathering point for Nazi-looted works of art."" After the war, the territory was returned to Poland, though some of the Dutch art was probably carted off to the Soviet Union by the Red Army, as were many museum records. Ms. Mielnik said in an interview that the museum is making an earnest effort to identify the paintings but that the process is difficult. ""It is worth remembering,"" she said, ""that many documents are nonexistent or in many different institutions, sometimes like puzzles that you need to put together."" Piotr Michalowski, the curator of the gallery of European Art at the Polish National Museum in Poznan, said in an interview that in 1945, almost all the museum's records were destroyed, either burned during fighting between German and Soviet forces or taken to Russia.

""We have no inventory books and no other records connected with collections and everything that happened with the Second World War here,"" he said. Mr. Michalowski said that the museum has not yet conducted provenance research of its collection, but is planning to do so in the next couple of years. He said he knew of eight paintings that had been purchased by the museum in 1942 at the Dorotheum auction house in Vienna, two of them by Dutch masters, and one with a label from the Goudstikker Gallery. He also found a painting the museum had purchased in 1942 from the Galerie Gurlitt in Berlin, owned at the time by Hildebrand Gurlitt, a dealer the Nazis had assigned to sell art seized from museums and Jews. Although these works have a dubious provenance, more research is needed to determine whether they were looted from Jews in the Netherlands. Gideon Taylor, chair of operations for the World Jewish Restitution Organization, an advocacy group based in New York, said Poland should take two steps to catch up with international restitution standards. ""The first step is transparency: to make publicly available information about what artworks it holds so that families can know that these works still exist,"" said Mr. Taylor. ""The second is to set up a process to deal with claims to return those works to those families. So far, we haven't seen any progress from Poland on either of those two steps.""","Despite the Polish government's efforts to recover cultural objects lost during World War II, researchers say its museums hold stolen items left behind by the Nazis.",da26856a-68cd-5898-a167-4021d351e28b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/12/arts/12looted1/12looted1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=2acc590262dd31cbe129975b25534a8944fa98e8767a4f380c62339bf14b3c68&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Researchers say Jan van Goyen's 1638 painting ""Huts on a Canal,"" now at the Gdansk National Museum in Poland, was stolen from a Dutch art dealer during World War II.",da26856a-68cd-5898-a167-4021d351e28b,N24News/imgs/da26856a-68cd-5898-a167-4021d351e28b.jpg,14
Media,Coming Soon to AMC Theaters: Virtual Reality Experiences,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/business/media/amc-theaters-virtual-reality.html,"Steven Spielberg was an early investor. So were 21st Century Fox, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Warner Bros. The venture's leadership team includes the former chief of Disney's theme park design division; the producer of the ""Men in Black"" movie series; and a live event kingpin. And now AMC Entertainment, the world's largest theater chain, has invested $20 million in the fledgling company and agreed to finance the rapid rollout of its product in the United States and Britain. The fuss is over Dreamscape Immersive, which has been working in a warehouse here for the last year and a half on what it calls a ""virtual-reality multiplex."" Instead of a variety of movies, Dreamscape Immersive locations will offer a variety of virtual-reality experiences. Its technology, developed by a Swiss motion-capture firm, allows up to six people to explore a virtual-reality environment at once, seeing fully rendered avatars of one another. ""We were mesmerized by what we saw,"" said Adam Aron, chief executive of AMC Entertainment. ""Their vision is to change what V.R. has been -- away from just a heightened level of video game and toward cinematic storytelling -- and we think it's what consumers have been waiting for.""

The AMC deal, which brings total investment in Dreamscape to more than $40 million, calls for up to six Dreamscape locations to open over the next 18 months. Some will be inside existing AMC theaters, and some will be stand-alone centers nearby. Additionally, Dreamscape will open a flagship location in the first quarter of next year at the Westfield Century City mall in Los Angeles. Westfield is another Dreamscape investor.

""In many cases, we have surplus space, and we think Dreamscape will add energy and excitement to our theaters, especially during the week,"" Mr. Aron said. ""But this isn't a replacement for movies. It's a complement."" Tickets are expected to cost from $15 to $20. Dreamscape joins a cluster of companies that are trying to take advantage of the still-untapped consumer promise of virtual-reality technology, the desperate need by shopping malls to reinvent themselves in the online retail age and the pressure on movie studios (and theater companies) to find new avenues of growth. The Void, a Utah start-up, recently announced a partnership with the Walt Disney Company to open ""Star Wars""-themed virtual-reality experiences at Disney malls outside theme parks in California and Florida. Already operating are two Imax V.R. Centres in Los Angeles and New York; tickets start at $7, and the Los Angeles location has attracted 50,000 people over the last nine months. Imax said it planned to expand the concept to Canada, Britain and Shanghai this fall.

The Hollywood players behind Dreamscape give it immediate cachet. Joining Mr. Spielberg are people like Hans Zimmer, the movie music composer, and the director Gore Verbinski. But their involvement does not guarantee success. Mr. Spielberg, for one, has been down this road before, with mixed results. In the late 1990s, his DreamWorks SKG invested alongside Universal Pictures in a heavily promoted venture called GameWorks, which was supposed to use new technology to revolutionize the arcade business. GameWorks never lived up to its billing.
* Jeff Bezos gives $100 million to the Obama Foundation.
* Stocks rise after President Biden says Jerome Powell will stay atop the Fed. Around the same time, Disney encountered similar disappointment with DisneyQuest, which was envisioned as a worldwide chain offering virtual-reality experiences. Only two were built. Two members of the Dreamscape management team, Walter Parkes, a co-chairman, and Bruce Vaughn, the chief executive, are very familiar with those efforts. Mr. Parkes, a movie producer whose credits include the ""Men in Black"" series, worked for Mr. Spielberg as a senior DreamWorks executive at the time. Mr. Vaughn spent 23 years at Disney, most recently serving as chief creative officer of its Imagineering research and design unit.

""Even big-name brands can have a hard time getting people to go here instead of there,"" Mr. Vaughn acknowledged. Mr. Vaughn was sitting in the Dreamscape warehouse last week with Mr. Parkes and Kevin Wall, an Emmy-winning producer of world-spanning music events like Live 8 and another Dreamscape co-chairman. The men, together with Aaron Grosky, the chief operating officer, said Dreamscape's fate would be different, partly because virtual-reality technology has advanced so significantly. ""This is truly the birth of a new storytelling medium,"" Mr. Parkes said. As if to prove it, Mr. Parkes took a reporter through a prototype Dreamscape experience. The company uses more than a dozen cameras and sensors to transport people into various settings -- home plate in a sold-out baseball stadium, the spider-filled ruins of an ancient temple or a futuristic, neon-lit city flooded with water.

Movies,'Ai Weiwei: Yours Truly' Review: On the Irony of Personal Freedom,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/movies/ai-weiwei-yours-truly-review.html,"The irony of personal freedom is that those who fight for it are robbed of their own. ""Ai Weiwei: Yours Truly"" explores the tension between the idea of liberty and the fate of those in pursuit of it by following the Chinese artist and activist Ai Weiwei as he creates @Large, an ambitious site-specific exhibition on Alcatraz Island.

The documentary, directed by Cheryl Haines, examines human rights issues by connecting Ai's personal history and activism with the history of Alcatraz and with those of other political dissidents across time and the world. Also explored are the challenges of producing site-specific work, made more complex by an artist who can never see the space (Ai was under house arrest in Beijing at the time), as well as a brief meditation on the role of public art. The result: a dizzying narrative that doesn't leave much room for processing.

When the film does slow down, it shines. Interviews with Ai and his mother reveal the psychological impact of the family's exile to a labor camp in northeast China in the late 1950s, and directly link to two main components of the exhibition: ""Trace,"" a room with Lego portraits of 176 people imprisoned for their beliefs laid out on the floor; and ""Yours Truly,"" another room where visitors are able to write postcards to a select number of those incarcerated people, which would later be mailed.

The film explores the positive impact of this analog correspondence and features interviews with Chelsea Manning, the former Army intelligence analyst who in 2010 leaked archives of military and diplomatic documents, and John Kiriakou, a former C.I.A. agent who confirmed the agency's use of torture.","This documentary from Cheryl Haines about Ai, a Chinese artist and activist, explores the tension between the idea of liberty and the fate of those who pursue it.",43fb25b7-509c-5378-bd11-7ff8f201deb5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/09/arts/09aiweiwei-art/merlin_174157329_9408a62c-fb78-4b32-9e4d-18fd514a078f-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=90ce2b6c64bb52b58d5cdd1e0dde773d99fa6d70ac1cc4cc116fac1d78eeb376&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The artist Ai Weiwei in ""Ai Weiwei: Yours Truly.""",43fb25b7-509c-5378-bd11-7ff8f201deb5,N24News/imgs/43fb25b7-509c-5378-bd11-7ff8f201deb5.jpg,5
Fashion & Style,Why Princess Eugenie's Peter Pilotto Wedding Dress Was a Thoroughly Modern Choice,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/fashion/princess-eugenie-peter-pilotto-wedding-dress.html,"LONDON -- Guests, celebrities and a handful of enthusiastic royalists descended on Windsor on Friday for the second royal wedding in the town this year, that of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank.

And just like Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, who managed to keep the designer behind her wedding dress a secret until she arrived on the steps of St. George's Chapel in May, Princess Eugenie, 28, kept onlookers guessing until the very last minute. However, the younger daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, ninth in line to the British throne, had offered several hints as to her brand of choice in the months before her big day.

""I'm not telling anyone who is making it, but I can say it is a British-based designer,"" the Princess told British Vogue this summer. The dress, she said, ""is the one thing that I was really decisive about. As soon as we announced the wedding, I knew the designer, and the look, straight away.""

On a blustery fall morning where guests quite literally had to hold onto their hats, the grand reveal finally arrived. The princess had chosen Peter Pilotto, a London-based fashion house with two creative directors, Mr. Pilotto and his partner, Christopher de Vos, to create a showstopping silk-jacquard gown that felt like a perfect choice for a modern-day princess.","The princess, who is ninth in line for the British throne, chose a gown that displayed scars from an operation to correct her scoliosis.",a5250020-118d-5657-b782-56ffc2f3dead,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/13/world/13Eugeniedress1/13Eugeniedress1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=5c09fc5b00c808d471415ef9bfa68c17c3b920f66c4b5264ea7cffe6bd4e74ea&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Princess Eugenie of York walking down the aisle with her father, the Duke of York, in St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, England, on Friday.",a5250020-118d-5657-b782-56ffc2f3dead,N24News/imgs/a5250020-118d-5657-b782-56ffc2f3dead.jpg,19
Technology,"Jeff Bezos, Tabloid Man",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/technology/jeff-bezos-tabloids.html,"SEATTLE -- When Jeff Bezos and his former wife, MacKenzie, celebrated what would be their last anniversary together around Labor Day 2018, they arrived at a Miami nightclub with no fanfare. His table was booked online, which is ""totally what tourists do"" and ""totally dorky,"" the club's celebrity liaison said in an interview at the time. Almost a year later, Mr. Bezos arrived at a hot Miami seafood restaurant in grander fashion, on a 90-foot-long Leopard superyacht in what The Miami Herald called ""the most extravagant entrance ever."" It was not his only superyacht of the summer. He lounged with his girlfriend on the media mogul David Geffen's boat in the Mediterranean, along with the supermodel Karlie Kloss and the former Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein. Mr. Bezos, 56, was also spotted on a ship owned by Diane von Furstenberg and Barry Diller off the coast of Venice. After gossip sites gushed about the $260 purple octopus swim trunks he wore in many photographs, the swimwear quickly sold out.

That image exploded by the end of January, when The National Enquirer reported about his affair with Lauren Sanchez, a former TV personality, including contents of intimate text messages between the two. After the Enquirer reporting, Mr. Bezos said he had opened up an investigation into how the paper acquired the messages, hinting that Saudi Arabia may have been involved because of his ownership of The Washington Post. This week, the United Nations released a statement, based largely on a forensic report commissioned by Mr. Bezos' investigators, that essentially accused Saudi Arabia's crown prince of hacking Mr. Bezos' phone to spy on him. The Saudi government called the claims ""absurd."" The report did not provide evidence that hacked material ended up in The Enquirer. But it did provide a potent reminder of how much has changed in a year. Mr. Bezos had become a tabloid fixture, with yacht appearances, evening strolls and romantic dinners captured in detail.

For people who know Mr. Bezos or have worked with him for years, the shift to the glare of The Daily Mail and Page Six is almost an out-of-body experience. ""It is a story that is pretty much irresistible to anyone,"" said George Rush, who co-wrote a gossip column with Joanna Molloy in The Daily News for 15 years. ""It has changed the public perception of him,"" Mr. Rush added. Jay Carney, Amazon's spokesman, said Mr. Bezos remained much the same. ""In the senior leadership here, which includes some of the people who have known and worked with Jeff the longest, there is a lot of empathy for what he's had to deal with and a lot of admiration for his remarkable ability to tune it out and focus on what matters,"" Mr. Carney said. Mr. Bezos remains deeply engaged with his work at Amazon and committed to the mission of The Washington Post, Mr. Carney said. ""None of that has changed.""

Ms. Bezos later focused on novel writing and studiously protected her family's privacy. Mr. Bezos' own employees used to tease him about his cargo pants. At one large staff meeting early in the company's history, someone asked what exactly he had in all those pockets. Among other things, Mr. Bezos pulled out a Swiss Army knife, to everyone's laughter, according to a longtime Amazon worker. Even as the company grew, Mr. Bezos did relatively little press for a tech executive and was far from a jet-setter. In a 2014 interview, he said he didn't like being on the road because it made him ""feel disconnected from the office."" He estimated he traveled as little as 10 percent of the time. As Amazon became ascendant and Mr. Bezos was on his way to becoming the world's richest man, his profile rose. He put on Oscar parties, supporting the company's investment in Hollywood, and bought The Washington Post. He began putting a billion dollars a year into his space company, Blue Origin.

But only rarely did he become a subject of celebrity news and tabloid publications. In the summer of 2017, he strutted through the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, an event swarming with prominent executives, bulked up with muscle. ""Swole Bezos"" became a viral sensation. Soon after, The New York Times Style section said he had ""steadily, and stealthily,"" transformed into a ""full-fledged style icon."" Then came the Enquirer revelations about the affair a year ago, supported by publishing photos and texts. It was juicy gossip, but received little sustained mainstream news coverage until February, when Mr. Bezos snapped back. He published a post on Medium, the online publishing platform, accusing The National Enquirer's parent company, American Media, of blackmail and extortion. He said the publisher had threatened to print a ""below-the-belt selfie"" of Mr. Bezos and other embarrassing photos if he didn't back off his claims that the paper's reporting was politically motivated. His post said American Media had motivations to please President Trump and the Saudi government. American Media said it acted lawfully.","Just a year ago, the world's richest man seemed to have a pretty low-key life.

Movies,Viewing Party! Let's All Watch 'Do the Right Thing' Together!,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/movies/do-the-right-thing.html,"Hello, everyone. This is Spike Lee, the producer, writer, director of 'Do the Right Thing.' This past June was the 30th anniversary of this film. I know the column is called 'Anatomy of a Scene.' I'm renaming this. I'm calling this 'Anatomy of a Murder.' The chokehold of Radio Raheem, played by the late, great Bill Nunn, my Morehouse brother-- ""(SINGING) Fight the power. Fight the power. We've got to--"" --was based upon the death of Michael Stewart. September 1983, Michael Stewart, a graffiti artist-- he's about as big as I am. 11 New York City transit police jumped on him and strangled our brother to death. That's where I got the idea for the chokehold murder of Radio Raheem. And five years ago, Eric Garner died the same way that Radio Raheem did in a movie that was based upon the real life choke hold of Michael Stewart. So a lot of things in this film that even though it was written 31 years ago are still happening today. Black and brown people are still being murdered today by police forces across the United States of America, and the people who inflict this death walk free-- don't get fired, don't get suspended. The film takes place one day, the hottest day of summer, in the People's Republic of Brooklyn, New York. So tensions have risen all throughout the day. And the reason why it looks the way it is because the edict, the command, to Ernest, the DP, Wynn Thomas, the production designer, Ruth Carter, the costume designer-- here's what I told them. I said, look, I want people to be sweating in an air conditioning theater when they see this film. [CRASHES] And what we wanted to do is after he destroys the boombox, it's quiet like the calm before a storm. Everybody's like, what's next? Everybody knows it gonna be bad. Everybody's looking around-- Radio Raheem. I mean, that was personal. It was like he got beat with the baseball bat because you've seen him the whole film with his boombox blasting Public Enemy's 'Fight the Power.' We did not have a very good stunt coordinator, and people got hurt. Danny Aiello's son, Danny Jr., was his father's double right here. This film was shot on one block in Bedford Stuyvesant. That one block got renamed 'Do the Right Thing Way,' the only street in the history of New York City named after a movie. [COMMOTION] Well, we gotta show that, number one, Sal's Famous Pizzeria, is on the corner of the block directly opposite the Korean fruit and vegetable stand. So the fracas spilled out from Sal's pizzeria to the street. So we had to show the block getting involved. ""Fight!"" ""Mookie!"" We wanted to start down and crane up so you could see the block. [COMMOTION] ""Kill you! We're gonna kill you, Sal!"" And this becomes a brouhaha. Ozzie, trying to talk some sense-- the love hate rings which is a homage to 'Night of the Hunter.' Robert Mitchum had them tattooed on his fingers. Now the cops come. Now we already have seen these two cops already. That's Rick on the left-- that's Rick Aiello, Danny's son. ""Break it up! Break it up! Get off him! Get off him! Get out of the way!"" And Sandoval play the other cop-- Miguel Sandoval. Now you know if there's a fight, who are they gonna grab? ""You get over here!"" [INTERPOSING VOICES] So this is a very hard scene to shoot. And for 31 years, it's been a hard scene to watch. [INTERPOSING VOICES] ""Just take him down, man."" ""Goddammit, you're killing him! You're killing him!"" ""Give it up, asshole! Give it up!"" This is the Michael Stewart chokehold. And when that Eric Garner thing happened, I put on my Instagram and Facebook with my editor, Barry Brown, and we cut back and forth between Radio Raheem and Eric Garner. And it's the same thing. ""Radio Raheem!"" ""Radio Raheem!"" ""No!"" And then when he falls, we laid the camera down on the street so he would fall right into the lens.",Gather at the cool-out corner and speak your mind about Spike Lee's 1989 portrait of a neighborhood — and country — on the boil.,84d806e7-1a4a-5b50-9c0b-979b17a57473,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/01/arts/30weekend-film1/30weekend-film1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=b7c11a1e80958cbd5a06a4969ae29526383993ac3376049028820e903f2ffd02&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Rosie Perez and Spike Lee in &ldquo;Do the Right Thing.&rdquo;,84d806e7-1a4a-5b50-9c0b-979b17a57473,N24News/imgs/84d806e7-1a4a-5b50-9c0b-979b17a57473.jpg,5
Automobiles,Cars Starved (or Stuffed) for Attention,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/04/automobiles/04FATCAR.html,"SOME DIET, MR. WURM The Austrian artist Erwin Wurm created a series of Fat Car sculptures, suggesting that autos may be too full of themselves.

THE Tango electric commuter car is a conversation piece wherever it appears, including the Detroit auto show in January, and last fall Jay Leno took one for a highly publicized test drive. The Tango is a yard-wide one-seater -- the State of California classifies it as a motorcycle -- that got a lift a few years ago from early adopters like the actor George Clooney and Sergey Brin, the co-founder of Google. The oh-so-narrow Tango may seem radically different, but it follows the precedent of other very thin cars. For instance, Volkswagen showed its skinny L1 diesel-electric hybrid -- said to be capable of 160 miles per gallon -- at the Frankfurt auto show last fall. At the 2009 Tokyo auto show, Nissan showed the Land Glider, a narrow concept car that leans on turns like a motorcycle. Another slimmed-down car -- a piece of art -- was recently seen at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Called ""La DS,"" it was included in a retrospective of works by the Mexican artist Gabriel Orozco. The exhibition has moved from New York to Switzerland, where it opens on April 18 at the Kunstmuseum in Basel. The show will later move to the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris and the Tate Modern in London.

The artwork is a highly modified Citroen DS, a car that the French nicknamed La Deesse -- or ""the goddess."" Roland Barthes, the French theorist and semiologist, once praised the iconic Citroen as a contemporary cathedral. In 1993, Mr. Orozco took a silver DS, removed the engine and sliced two feet out of the middle. The result is a ""car"" not quite 45 inches wide. (The VW L1's width is 49 inches, the Land Glider's 43 and the Tango's just 39.) The Citroen DS is a symbol of national pride in France, and Mr. Orozco's manipulation of it is a commentary -- a bit of wry blasphemy against the goddess, like pasting a mustache on the Statue of Liberty. Like the Tango, ""La DS"" is so skinny it seems to trick the eye. A news release for the MoMA show said Mr. Orozco ""deliberately blurs the boundaries between the art object and the everyday environment."" He had previously said that in making the piece his idea was ""to deconstruct a cultural icon that is not just an icon, because it is also a machine that has a function, and to remake it on its own logic.""

While thin is in, for automobiles as well as fashion models, an Austrian artist seems to demonstrate that cars are so full of themselves that they are about to burst out of their skins. The artist, Erwin Wurm, made his Fat Cars as puffy, obese, life-size sculptures that bulge like overfilled sacks. Like the thin cars, they undercut the iconic qualities of certain cars -- to transform a svelte Porsche into a pudgy roadster, as he has done, is a joke in itself. The Fat Cars seem to poke fun at pomposity. Mr. Wurm has also done Fat Houses, mocking oversize homes. In 2002, he persuaded curators to put pillows inside their clothing and walk about art galleries -- literally making fun of stuffed shirts. WAITING TO EXHALE ""La DS,"" a sculpture by Gabriel Orozco, proves that Citroens can't be too thin. Born in 1954, Mr. Wurm has a history of unusual artworks. His One Minute Sculptures was a bit of performance art created by museum visitors who agreed to serve as models for 60 seconds. The Fat Cars have been shown around the world, including stops in Moscow, San Francisco and the Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass. Mr. Wurm exhibits at the Aurel Scheibler gallery in Berlin, the Galerie Krinzinger in Vienna and the Lehmann Maupin Gallery in New York, where a Wurm show is planned for the fall.

For his first Fat Car, Mr. Wurm worked with Opel designers, but found the result less than satisfactory. He told an interviewer in Austria, Peter Zuspan, that his idea was to combine something like a biological system with a mechanical one. But Opel's computerized design equipment could not produce the kind of ""natural"" rounded shapes that he wanted, he said. Instead, Mr. Wurm ended up using only the chassis of an actual car. The ""fat"" was polyurethane foam and Styrofoam covered with lacquer. The ""Fat Convertible"" came in 2004 and a car with no wheels, ""UFO,"" in 2006. Just as cars may be on the cusp of fundamental change -- with batteries perhaps supplanting the internal-combustion engine -- artists seem to be rethinking the automobile as a symbol.

Fashion & Style,"Fendi, the Legacy of Empire — and Lagerfeld",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/fashion/fendi-lagerfeld-couture-rome.html,"ROME -- There has been some debate over how Karl Lagerfeld, former creative director of Chanel and Fendi, the man who essentially defined the role of the modern creative director until his death in February at age -- well, no one is entirely sure; general guess is 85 -- would have felt about the extravagant memorial held two weeks ago in Paris. He famously, after all, never wanted a grand public funeral. He hated looking back. How would he have felt about the Fendi couture show held Thursday night at the Temple of Venus and Rome high atop the Palatine Hill in the Italian capital, the uplit arches of the Colosseum serving as backdrop, the moon lighting the paths -- a show meant to be not a retrospective but rather a homage to the values he gave the brand (lightness, a sense of identity and history, a willingness to subvert all the bourgeois rules of fur) and a bridge to the future? That was a little easier to imagine.

He loved the idea, anyway, according to Serge Brunschwig, Fendi's chief executive, when Mr. Brunschwig first proposed it a while ago . Fendi has made something of a fetish of its Roman roots, and has been embedding itself in the city for awhile now: It restored and now makes its headquarters in the Palazzo della Civilta Italiana , a travertine architectural monument with six floors of grand arches on every side, initially commissioned by Benito Mussolini to represent his new Roman empire. It gave $2.6 million to restore the Trevi Fountain -- and then, in 2016, held a fashion show over its waters. And now it has committed EUR2.5 million to restore the Temple of Venus and Rome, the largest temple of ancient Rome, designed by Emperor Hadrian and consecrated in A.D. 121. This show served to both celebrate and publicize the relationship. As well as to suggest -- implicitly, of course -- Fendi as the emperor of Italian fashion.

""Karl used to say 'Fendi is my Roman side,'"" Silvia Venturini Fendi said backstage before the show. ""It is impossible to do a show in such a place without paying homage to the setting and the city."" There had been some debate over when, exactly, it should take place, but after Mr. Lagerfeld's death, Ms. Fendi said, ""we decided we had to do it, and dedicate this show to him. It was a way of showing we are a good, tight team and have learned so much from him.""

They did it in 54 looks, one for each year Mr. Lagerfeld worked at the company. They did it in extraordinary intarsia sables and minks inspired by patterns on the temple floors and ceilings, shaved and printed and marbleized and then cut into mosaics and pieced together in elaborate geometric patterns on tulle. They did it in organza and mousseline ball gowns printed to resemble the same inlaid stone effect and constructed to float around the body like parachutes before they touch the earth. In louche 1970s flares and matching jackets and big Betty Boop bikini briefs with 1950s bra tops under sweeping leather coats intricately cut to look like tiles. In delicate bias dresses embroidered with raffia sheaves of wheat and waving wildflowers inspired by a book on the Viennese Secession movement that Mr. Lagerfeld gave Ms. Fendi the last time they met, and by period figures like Hoffman n, Wagner and Klimt. And in narrow day dresses like columns made from wool sliced into different geometries and set on tulle, the better to cool the body.

They did it in clothes that were half fur (Mr. Lagerfeld had introduced the concept of a ""haute fourrure"" show in 2015, when it was met with graphic protests), and half fur-free. Fendi is one of the few brands that continues to declare its allegiance to the material -- it began life, after all, as a family fur house -- but even Fendi has to begin to move in some different directions (it is now, for example, haute couture). As to what happens next, no one is entirely sure. As Ms. Fendi, currently though not officially leading the brand forward, acknowledged. ""I called the show 'The Dawn of Romanity,'"" she said. ""It represents a new chapter."" Once upon a time for a city, and now for a house.","The couture show at the Temple of Venus and Rome was a fitting homage to just how much the designer gave the house, and a step into an unknown future.",60b34674-092a-55aa-adfd-049153868d29,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/05/fashion/05FENDi-2/05FENDi-2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=2d03b1162979b4576c2a612bb994ec08b3da4adad4701f6ffa72b745b4935467&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Fendi haute couture, fall 2019",60b34674-092a-55aa-adfd-049153868d29,N24News/imgs/60b34674-092a-55aa-adfd-049153868d29.jpg,19

Theater,2017 Tony Awards: Our Theater Critics Debate the Nominations,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/theater/nominations-hello-dolly-dear-evan-hansen-tony-awards.html,"Good morning, Jesse in New York, and good morning Ben, in London. Ben, do the Tony nominations make news in London? JESSE GREEN Why didn't you ask me if they make news in Brooklyn? GREEN The feed was delayed but they are now celebrating at Junior's.

BEN BRANTLEY As might have been predicted, angry crowds have already gathered in Trafalgar Square, to protest the snubbing of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" further straining already frayed Anglo-American relations. Actually, I imagine Champagne corks are popping at the Old Vic for the strong showing by ""Groundhog Day,"" which originated here. GREEN ""Groundhog Day"" received seven nominations; ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" received zero. About right, by me. BRANTLEY Agreed. And the view from abroad is a heartening one, to my eyes, at least. What a great (American) roster of new plays, for a change. GREEN Yes, the nominees for Best Play, which means best new play, are ""Sweat,"" ""Oslo,"" ""Indecent"" and ""A Doll's House, Part 2,"" all of which are important, challenging works. I would like to have seen ""Heisenberg"" on the list somehow, too, but it opened and closed very early in the season.

Do you think there's a clear favorite? GREEN ""A Doll's House, Part 2"" got the most favorable reviews across the board, but it may be seen as the connoisseur's choice. And the larger body of Tony voters are not necessarily connoisseurs, they're business people. They may go for ""Sweat"" or ""Oslo."" ""Sweat"" did win the Pulitzer recently -- I served on the drama panel that nominated it. BRANTLEY I'd be happy if either ""Doll's House"" or ""Oslo"" won. ""Doll's House"" is more adventurous, but the scale of ""Oslo"" is impressive, as is its ability to disseminate such intricate details of foreign policy without turning snoozy. GREEN ""Oslo"" is also, all things considered, a feel-good show, even if history has disproved its optimism. Voters, like humans generally, often prefer that to an ambiguous ending. The April rush to the Tonys deadline was especially intense this year and I'm sure both of you were bleary-eyed at the end (as were the Tony nominators). ""Doll's House"" was the last show to open and got a lot of love. Did its arrival after a bunch of musicals help its cause? BRANTLEY Well, I think it had the advantage of serving as a genuine stimulant after a couple of sleeping-pill shows (no names, ""Anastasia"" and ""Charlie""). And what an upper to end on. Also, how great to see Laurie Metcalf in a part she can run (and I hope win) with. Let's talk musicals. Are there any sure things? GREEN There are many sure things, or if not sure then sure enough. ""Dear Evan Hansen,"" which received nine nominations, will likely win two of the biggest: Best Musical and Leading Actor for Ben Platt. ""Hello, Dolly!"" which received 10, will very likely win Best Musical Revival and Leading Actress for Bette Midler. This even though ""Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812"" got more nominations than either, with 12.

BRANTLEY Two months ago, I would have said ""Evan Hansen"" had a lock. But there's a lot of sentimental (and political) steam around ""Come From Away."" And Andy Karl, valiant trouper in a knee brace that he is, may get a lot of come-from-behind love. ""Dolly"" and the woman playing her are worth betting the farm (or the Harmonia Gardens) on. GREEN Sentimental is right, regarding ""Come From Away,"" but you and I disagreed strongly about that show. I felt that it was little more than an evening of Canadian civic boosterism. I would be disappointed if it prevailed over a truly complicated -- morally complicated, I mean -- piece like ""Evan Hansen."" But stranger things have happened. BRANTLEY Indeed. I'm not stumping for ""Come From Away."" But I am kind of stunned by the word of mouth it's generated. We disagreed on it less strongly than you think, I suspect, though I thought for a work of efficient sentimental manipulation, it delivered. The last two Tony-winning musicals were ""Fun Home"" and ""Hamilton,"" both universally admired and seen as important advances for the art form. Does this year's roster of musical nominees point toward the future? BRANTLEY In a word, no. What I think is encouraging is the -- you should pardon the catchword -- diversity of what's on offer. And by that I don't mean just politically, but in terms of the different languages each of the nominees for Best Musical and Best Play speak. GREEN And let's face it, it was -- with 1.5 exceptions -- not a good year for new musicals in the first place. The roster can't be better than its individual components. BRANTLEY Which I'd say is a good thing. Remember when ""Sunset Boulevard"" (to cite a personal favorite of yours, Jesse) stood alone?

GREEN And I should add that even if I didn't like a lot of the new musicals much more than I liked ""Sunset Boulevard,"" there was much to admire within them, whether performances, or songwriting or design. ""Great Comet"" swept the design categories, deservedly. But I was sorry to find the score of ""War Paint"" skunked. Whatever else that show may be, it's an example of classic theater songwriting. BRANTLEY I would have had it nominated for ""Pink"" alone (That's Christine Ebersole's great solo at the end.) Two final questions. Any performer you felt was unfairly overlooked? And Jesse -- what is a .5 good show? GREEN The nominating committee made good work of a difficult job. That said, I would like to have seen Mary-Louise Parker (for ""Heisenberg"") and ... BRANTLEY You plucked the name out of my mouth, Jesse.

BRANTLEY But what do you do when a cast is as uniformly strong as that of ""Jitney""? This is when you wish there were a Best Ensemble category. GREEN Exactly. As for ""a .5 good show,"" well, that's really .25 times two: ""Great Comet"" and ""Groundhog Day."" Your mileage may (and does) vary. BRANTLEY Ah, I'd give ""Great Comet"" a larger percentage. ""Groundhog Day,"" too, though I agree that ""Evan Hansen"" is the smoothest ride.","The co-chief theater critics Ben Brantley and Jesse Green, on the nominated plays, musicals and actors.",e8de95c4-8e9d-5586-bda7-ba38afa5ea1a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/03/arts/03TONYSCONVO1/03TONYSCONVO1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=af46eccbd8cbd78bfd2332268d2da9adcb0b6c0030512c1219a6e68fb588d15e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Tony Award nominees Mike Faist, left, and Ben Platt in the musical ""Dear Evan Hansen.""",e8de95c4-8e9d-5586-bda7-ba38afa5ea1a,N24News/imgs/e8de95c4-8e9d-5586-bda7-ba38afa5ea1a.jpg,10
Fashion & Style,New Documentary Captures the Elusive Azzedine Alaïa,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/09/fashion/documentary-fashion-azzedine-alaia.html,"Famous but underappreciated has become a foolproof template for documentary subjects in recent years, used in films as disparate as ""Searching for Sugar Man,"" ""20 Feet From Stardom"" and ""My Architect."" Add to the trope a cinematic fascination with fashion and you have the basis for a poetic documentary about a tempestuous and imposingly gifted Tunisian-born French designer who, while exalted among cognoscenti, is all but unknown to the wider world.

The designer is Azzedine Alaia, a septuagenarian best known for the figure-enhancing designs he has created for some of world's more exceptional women, including Marion Cotillard, Greta Garbo, Grace Jones and Michelle Obama. The film is a self-financed labor of love created -- with the rare cooperation of Mr. Alaia -- by the fashion stylist Joe McKenna, himself the quiet force behind campaigns for Balmain, Giorgio Armani, Jil Sander, Miu Miu and Versace, and formerly the fashion director at large for The New York Times's T magazine.

In 2013, Mr. McKenna first asked himself how no one had thought to record the life and working process of an award-winning master at times as much feared as revered.

""I'd been asked to guest-edit an issue of Self Service magazine,"" he said by telephone from Paris. ""And I thought there was sort of restlessness in fashion, so I interviewed a lot of designers and C.E.O.s and asked them what was wrong.""","A tempestuous designer who does not follow the corporate calendar or Instagram's whims reluctantly sat for an unusual, untitled film.",d5bc2dea-4c4a-5584-811d-21da3eab51c1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/12/fashion/12AZZEDINE-web/12AZZEDINE-web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=0758da9fb001ffb3a3ca2aca7b91774a1846554100341875881edf22d27de8ee&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Azzedine Alaïa, a respected and influential designer, is the subject of a new documentary.",d5bc2dea-4c4a-5584-811d-21da3eab51c1,N24News/imgs/d5bc2dea-4c4a-5584-811d-21da3eab51c1.jpg,19
Your Money,The Private School Tax Break in the Middle-Class Tax Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/your-money/the-private-school-tax-break-in-the-middle-class-tax-bill.html,"If we are to believe the Republican policymakers who control the current attempt to overhaul our tax system, a big point of the exercise is to help the middle class. So how best to explain a possible tax break of more than $30,000 per child for wealthy families who send their kids to private school? That number is the potential net new tax savings, under the House tax plan, for parents who deposit a large amount of money when their kids are born. They would get that benefit by using the money for children starting private school in kindergarten and attending through high school. Buried in Section 1202 of the tax bill are a number of proposals to consolidate and simplify various tax breaks for education savings. Part of the section in effect would neuter something called a Coverdell account, which families have used for years to save for both private school and college. But then comes the big change: Elementary and high school expenses of up to $10,000 per year would become ""qualified"" expenses for 529 plans. Translation? You could pull $10,000 each year out of your 529 account for private school and avoid paying taxes on any previous growth. There are no income limits on who can use 529 plans, and you would be able to keep right on saving for college as well.

So how did this proposal come to pass? Like many things that are important to relatively few people but find their way into large bills nevertheless, it's kind of a long story. First, about those Coverdells. They are named for Paul Coverdell, a Republican senator from Georgia in the 1990s who wanted to create tax breaks for parents whose children do not attend public schools. In 2001, President George W. Bush signed a bill allowing holders of the accounts to use any earnings in them for tuition in kindergarten through 12th grade (college, too). The rules, however, capped annual contributions at $2,000. That limited how much of a benefit you could get over 15 years or so by avoiding capital gains taxes that you would have otherwise paid in a different savings vehicle that offered investments in stocks and bonds.

The provision in the new tax bill, which echoes a legislative attempt in 2012 and an idea that the conservative Heritage Foundation suggested then, proposes to end contributions into Coverdells (except for rollover contributions). Then it adds the $10,000 sweetener: You could pull that much out of 529 plans, which are currently a savings vehicle only for college and graduate school, and use it for K-12 tuition. And 529 plans have few if any contribution restrictions and very high limits on balances. Now, a quick 529 refresher. You put money in, and in 35 states you get some sort of tax break when you do so, according to Andrea Feirstein, a plan consultant. The money grows tax free, and when you withdraw it to pay for higher-education expenses, you pay no taxes, capital gains or otherwise. So what would it mean to add private school benefits to 529 plans? Take a wealthy family in the highest tax bracket. It has a newborn baby, and through some combination of gifts and its own savings, it opens a 529 plan with $200,000 and never deposits another dime. If the money grows at 6 percent annually, that family could take out the $10,000 each year, avoiding $2,380 in taxes annually. If it did that for 13 years (kindergarten through 12th grade), it would save $30,940 in taxes. Plus, according to numbers that Vanguard ran for me, it would still have enough left over after high school ($370,717) to pay for many pricey private colleges in full, as long as tuition inflation there ran no more than 3 percent annually.

And once college began, the family could withdraw as much as the entire annual cost of college and related expenses (not just $10,000), avoiding taxes on any gains all the while. It sure seemed to me -- someone who has used the Coverdells for private school tuition, but who worries about being able to save a decent chunk for college while also using 529s for any future K-12 tuition for two kids -- that this was a giant gift to a tiny slice of the wealthiest people in America.

That's not, however, how some people see it. Robert C. Enlow, president and chief executive of EdChoice, a school-choice advocacy organization, reminded me of the move that many families are able to make when it's time to pay college tuition each year. Even if they have saved nothing, they'll drop that term's tuition money into a 529 account to pick up that year's state tax deduction. Then they'll pull the money out right afterward to pay the bill. That can be worth a couple of hundred dollars right then and there, and if the House bill passes, the same opportunity will exist for families 13 times before college. You may even be able to do this with money you have borrowed. Not all wealthy families with children in private school would take advantage of a provision like this. Some have financial advisers who steer them away from 529s, because they think that the investments are unsophisticated or that the accounts have too many restrictions. Other individuals don't want to tie up that much capital in savings that could be used to smooth over rough patches if their income is variable. Then there are still large numbers of people who find 529s -- with their dozens of state-based iterations and differing state tax benefits and menus of investments -- confusing to the point of absurdity. For every other 1 percenter with a family, however, this sure seems like an extraordinary gift. And it will be fascinating -- and revealing -- to see how long it remains under the big tax Christmas tree.","The House proposal would let families pull $10,000 annually from 529 savings accounts to pay for private school tuition, saving money on capital gains taxes.",c48fbbb0-bc00-59f0-94fd-0a304ec4f0c6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/09/business/09MONEYsub/09MONEY-2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=dae7cf90a3c9d289675d8714c253de28b5a1b2a1963b310c42c031b754f33640&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The independent Trinity School in Manhattan.

The defect could cause the wheel to suddenly lean inward or outward. Jaguar says that because ""vehicle stability will be compromised and the degree of directional control minimized, this significantly increases the risk of an accident.""

The automaker said it was not aware of any accidents, injuries or failures on customer vehicles related to what it called a ""long-term durability concern.""

# Mazda is recalling about 5,700 of its 2014 Mazda 3 and 2014-15 Mazda 6 cars because of a problem with the regenerative engine braking system. The company says that in heavy rain or deep puddles, the generator belt may get wet and slip, which can cause the power control module to conclude that there is a failure of the energy storage capacitor. In such a case, the charging system would be stopped. If the driver were to ignore the associated warning light, the battery would be drained, which ""will likely result in loss of steering assist, windshield wiper operation and the engine will finally stop operating.""

The agency asked Mazda why it didn't recall the vehicles sooner because it knew about the problem last summer. Mazda said in its response that no recall was needed because the defect was not ""an unreasonable risk to safety"" because a warning light was illuminated. But, the automaker said, it decided to issue a recall in the United States after government safety officials in Japan insisted on a recall in that country.

# Jaguar is recalling about 1,600 XFs from the 2013-14 model years because of a stalling problem, according to a report the automaker filed with the agency.

Real Estate,"Apartment Buildings, the Latest in French Ideas",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/realestate/apartment-buildings-the-latest-in-french-ideas.html,"The gold standard for the New York apartment house is the big, lumbering 1884 Dakota, often called the first real apartment house in the city. But to cognoscenti, another building makes a run for that distinction, the 1870 Stuyvesant Apartments at 142 East 18th Street, an oddball little five-story walk-up with an impeccable pedigree, demolished half a century ago. But instead of the Stuyvesant, should it have been named the Rutherford? Peter Gerard Stuyvesant was a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant, a colonial governor of Dutch New York who had a farm at the northeast end of what is now Stuyvesant Street. When Peter Gerard died in 1847, he left no children, and his will settled a fortune upon 5-year-old Stuyvesant Rutherford (sometimes spelled Rutherfurd) as long as he took the Stuyvesant surname. Sources vary as to their relationship, but the boy's mother was a Stuyvesant descendant, and Peter Gerard is often referred to as his great-uncle. Take his name the heir did, in 1863. About the newly minted Rutherford Stuyvesant we know little. On an 1863 military roster he gave his occupation as ""gentleman."" He traveled abroad in 1865, although to destinations unknown. He married in 1870; his wife died in childbirth in 1879. At midcentury, New Yorkers who were comfortably off, but not rich, often lived in row houses. Built deep on narrow lots, they had many stairs to climb, which servants resented. The apartment house, offering knee-friendly one-floor living, was common abroad but slow to catch on here, suffering from its association with the working-class tenement, with its communal toilets and windowless rooms.

In 1869 The Real Estate Record and Guide predicted that the ""average American is not prepared to live openly in part of a house"" and would prefer a long commute to the suburbs. In November 1869 The New York Tribune carried a notice that ""Mr. Rutherford Stuyvesant's new building ... is now rapidly approaching completion. It is an attempt to introduce in this city the style of house-building almost universal in Paris, that of including several distinct suites of rooms under a single roof. This is wholly different from the plan of the tenement house."" What motivated Stuyvesant, then 27, is not known.

But he hired the architect Richard Morris Hunt, already famous for bringing back from Paris the latest in French ideas, and Hunt worked out a Victorian Gothic design in brick and stone, with a Parisian-style mansard roof. Opened in 1870, the new Stuyvesant had a common doorway serving two tiers of apartments, two apartments per line. Each had an awkward layout of three bedrooms, and a parlor, a servant's room, a bathroom and a kitchen all the way at the rear; cooking smells wafting throughout an apartment were considered a tenement hallmark.

The earliest tenants included the sugar importer Albert De Lamontaigne and artists including Worthington Whittredge. Also resident were at least two architects, Peter Bonnett Wight and Maurice Fornachon, an assistant in Hunt's office. Many tenants had servants. According to the 1869 annual report of the Department of Buildings, the rent decreased the higher the floor, from $120 a month on the second floor to $76 on the fifth; there was no elevator. The rents yielded an annual income of $23,000 as against an outlay of $200,000 for the building and land; estimates for expenses are not known. The book ""New York 1880,"" by Robert A. M. Stern, Thomas Mellins and David Fishman, calls the Stuyvesant the ""foundation stone"" of the apartment movement, and this claim has never been seriously challenged. The apartment house, known at first as a French flat, took off as developers mined a completely new market. According to the Avery Architectural Library's digitization of The Real Estate Record and Guide, that term appears not at all in the 1860s, but 126 times in the 1870s. Although The Record and Guide criticized the Stuyvesant's facade as ""rambling and incoherent,"" it also reported that every apartment had been snapped up before the building was completed and that hundreds of applicants had been turned away. Despite his project's success, Stuyvesant built only minor buildings in New York thereafter, and never with any architect of Hunt's stature. The Stuyvesant itself was soon eclipsed by buildings including the Dakota, but it lasted quite nicely for 90 years in a comfortable old-shoe twilight. It was demolished for a new structure, Gramercy Green, built in 1960. Rutherford Stuyvesant married a second time in 1902, and was survived by several children when he died in Paris in 1909. When his grandson, Peter R. Stuyvesant, died in 1970 at 34, his obituary in The New York Times said he had been the ""last direct male descendant of the famous Dutch governor of New York."" The Stuyvesants and Rutherfords were among the most socially prominent of the old New York families. In the 2012 Social Register, 32 people are listed under Rutherford; under Stuyvesant, there are none.","The Stuyvesant Apartments, opened in 1870, offered New Yorkers a newfangled living arrangement.",d19f9942-66f2-5a6e-8ea6-88c103fc89b8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/07/14/realestate/14STREETS/14STREETS-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2013&h=631&w=600&s=12013143367b3a160c5bc8d8559d458207ea273b707260bacbff9712036ad254&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"The five-story Stuyvesant Apartments in 1869, shortly before opening.

Theater,The Stage Door at Sea: A Broadway Star on Her First Fan Cruise,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/theater/the-stage-door-at-sea-a-broadway-star-on-her-first-fan-cruise.html,"Broadway people spend most of their lives as people not on Broadway. A minority of actors make it to New York's biggest stage, and a further minority of those who do are there now. One need only to have starred in a Broadway musical a year (or 20 years) ago to be billed as a Broadway star. Shows don't run forever, and musical theater actors are regularly adrift -- between roles, we say -- seeking ways to continue to work and spread the faith. ""Broadway"" is now an idea, a climate, as much as it is a place. Broadway exists on social media. It is on Twitter. It is on Tumblr. Despite more digital access than ever, theater lovers still seek to broaden their experience of Broadway, finding ways to share real face-time with actors out of costume, out of character and, as it often happens, out of work. Within one recent month I participated in two such events for die-hard theater fans -- one by land, one by sea: first a convention, then a cruise ship. Three weeks before I set sail, I was invited to teach, sing and sign CDs at a spirited expo in New York called BroadwayCon, a three-day event held at the Javits Center which hosted 6,000 visitors a day and offered 200 hours of original programming for a daily admission of $95. More than 1,700 autographs were signed this year in the official area -- 170 by Chita Rivera alone, according to the BroadwayCon publicist, 171 by Joel Grey. (Perhaps his rep spoke to Chita's.) Some 500 theater professionals appeared on panels and gave performances, interviews and workshops. I led one entitled ""The Art of Perseverance.""

God knows I would have loved this when I was a teenager: I spent portions of my own adolescence pacing the theater district in the 1980s, hoping to catch a stage-door glimpse of Jim Dale or Bernadette Peters or Dorothy Loudon. I would have fainted if I merely saw their skin in daylight. The zenith of fan and performer interaction, though, takes place over several days at sea, on a ""Broadway on the High Seas"" cruise organized by Playbill magazine. I was among several singers who joined one recently, ready to participate in a ""luxurious week of sun and songs"" and a tour of the Caribbean. I packed my gowns, tried and failed to get spray-tanned -- after four months in an Off Broadway run of ""Finian's Rainbow"" I was not merely pale but computer-screen white, with bluish overtones -- and took my husband and three young daughters, who had blessedly been invited. Off we went. When we arrived onboard in San Juan, the president of Playbill publishing, Phil Birsh, gathered the artists in the Parisian Lounge for a welcoming speech. There were eight ""performers"" on this ship, including Brian Stokes Mitchell and Alice Ripley, both Tony Award winners, and another eight ""ambassadors,"" many also Tony winners, there generally to schmooze and enjoy a vacation. Clarifying the rules of engagement, Mr. Birsh assured us that the boat would be occupied by about 250 Broadway fans (each paying between $4,000 and $14,000), but that they were not going to make us uncomfortable in any way. They're not aggressive, he said. They're not stalkers. (This was an oddly unreassuring thing to say.) We were on display -- there was no doubt about that -- but then the guests were on display, too. And we were as curious about their motives for wanting to be part of an event marked ""Broadway"" as they were curious about our careers. For once, artists and audience were really all in the same boat.

Our first occasion to meet the other passengers was at the mandatory lifeboat drill. We were taught how to jump overboard: Hold your nose and mouth shut with one hand, then wrap the other arm around your body in an urgent hug designed to keep your life vest from slipping overhead and off. As we practiced, I imagined myself in an ocean-billowed ball gown, or floating in the Atlantic in my orange vest, with its water-activated light-bulb feature, singing Sondheim as I sank, illuminated. I was a performer, and, as it happened, I drew the short (or was it long?) straw: I'd perform our very first night. Assembling a set list for any cabaret performance is one of the arts you have to master in this life, and I had tried to make this one a good mix of familiar but not too familiar numbers. Onstage, though, a show-tune singer rarely has to worry about seasickness. Entering by the aisle stairs of the swaying Art-Deco theater in my rented Monique Lhuillier, I started to feel my steak and salad coming back to me. How might I feel during the eight-minute jazz waltz medley of hits by my heroine Julie Andrews? That I might waltz into the wall, or vomit backstage (please, not onstage, I hoped) started to seem disconcerting. I put my elbows solidly on my stool to steady myself. After the concert, guests seemed to feel they knew me -- and I got to know them. ""It's my 90th birthday,"" one woman, her husband in tow, told me. ""We've been married 67 years, he's 93, and I'm still directing a choir! How about that?"" ""We are not like those rich people who come from Long Island,"" the husband in another couple, cruise veterans, confided: ""The first one we did was last year -- everyone that was supposed to show up didn't show up."" On something of first-name basis with stage talent, he seemed to know just why -- and didn't seem especially fussed about it: ""Stokes got 'Shuffle Along.' Judy Kuhn was still doing 'Fun Home.' Cheyenne went to do a concert."" (Playbill makes clear in its advertising that the roster of attendees may change.)

Every day at 5:30, Seth Rudetsky (a radio host and the creator and co-writer of the Broadway musical ""Disaster!"" about, yes, a sinking cruise boat) would host an onstage interview with four performers. Audience and actors alike gravitated to stories of failed auditions, mishaps and flops; broken bones, forgotten lyrics, missteps and missed steps; under-rehearsed understudies and shows closing before opening. Listening to my friends and colleagues, the boat seemed to float on their humor and resilience. I thought of a snorkeling excursion just hours earlier, when I'd seen a colorful reef that had grown around a shipwreck: The perfect image of an actor's life. In the elevator, I was met with ""I am amazed at how friendly and accessible all the actors are,"" which felt nice, and ""What a delight you are, Melissa, I am going to put in a wonderful evaluation on you,"" which felt nice but reminded me of the actor's reality: We are always up for critical comment. Mostly, I kept busy with daily excursions. On land there was rain-forest hiking and ziplining -- though none of us, fans or performers, were quite prepared for the intimacies that demanded. Some 250 feet above a St. Kitts mountain valley, facing 1,600 feet of wire, our guide taught proper technique for impact: leaning back, chin tucked and ""window open, hon"" -- meaning legs bent with thighs wide apart, so knees avoided hitting metal springs. I now saw my audience -- and they, me -- from an unexpected angle. In the evenings, actors often sat at the ""actors table"" in the rear of the fourth-floor restaurant. We talked about time and enduring, music and phrasing and failing and getting up. ""Frustration is fuel,"" I said. The whole table liked that. Few of us knew what work would come our way when we got home. In part, this is what makes the cruise -- despite its brushes with glamour -- authentic; the fans get an up-close sense of the vulnerability of performers. As for us, we were glad to have seven days together -- out of combat, out of the trenches. A perfect twist on Leonard Bernstein's ""On the Town,"" where sailors land cheerfully in New York, singing and dancing in Times Square, it was a kind of shore leave -- an actor's shore leave, run in reverse, like so many things in this day-for-night life.",Melissa Errico is comforted to find that theater aficionados are interested in the lows as well as the highs of a stage career.,7304aa4f-a429-576e-a2d1-240dddbc34e0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/09/arts/09CRUISE1/09CRUISE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=d0277e733f7b0ca048a0ea80c26ed39a1d09f80463f35d9af240acd9140472d1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Melissa Errico steadies herself while performing on a Caribbean cruise for Broadway fans.,7304aa4f-a429-576e-a2d1-240dddbc34e0,N24News/imgs/7304aa4f-a429-576e-a2d1-240dddbc34e0.jpg,10
Media,"The New Day, a British Upstart, Casts Its Fate to the Newsstand",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/04/business/media/the-new-day-a-british-upstart-casts-its-fate-to-the-newsstand.html,"PARIS -- The New Day, Britain's youngest media start-up, has a little something for everyone: a digest of the day's top news, human-interest features, coverage of popular culture, sports, health and travel, and even advice columnists. What it doesn't have is a website. Or an app. Or really much of a digital presence at all. At a time when most of the world's publishers have accepted as gospel that the future is digital, such a bet on dead trees has more than a few industry analysts scratching their heads. The move comes as news outlets like The Huffington Post, Politico and Business Insider make stronger digital pushes into European markets and just as some of the region's established titles are scaling back or ending print production altogether. The Independent, one of Britain's most respected newspapers, went digital-only on March 26, and El Pais, Spain's largest daily, warned its staff last month that it was considering a similar move. But with a goal of attracting as many as one million paying readers a week, The New Day's publisher, Trinity Mirror, one of Britain's largest media companies, is convinced that its print-only daily can find an audience in Britain's famously crowded newspaper market. ""There is a boldness to that decision,"" said Douglas McCabe of Enders Analysis, a media research group in London. ""At a time when print circulations are falling at high percentage rates year in and year out, to launch a print-only product is really brave. You have to feel pretty confident that you are filling a genuinely material market gap.""

Started just over a month ago , the 40-page New Day prints five days a week and is available at 40,000 newsstands across Britain, where it sells for 50 pence, or about 70 cents, a copy. Home subscriptions are not an option and, aside from an initial two-week promotion in early March, the newspaper does not plan to give away any of its content. ""You don't want to go down that avenue,"" said The New Day's editor, Alison Phillips. ""There is still a significant number of people who have the habit in their blood"" of paying for content and who prefer the experience of reading off-line, she said.

Ms. Phillips acknowledged that the sheer volume of free content online, as well as the convenience of being able to read it on mobile phones and other devices, has helped drive readers away from print. But with The New Day, Trinity Mirror is also gambling that print readership is declining for another simple reason: Many British readers simply do not like the other print choices available. So-called quality dailies like The Guardian, The Times and The Telegraph are too dense and ponderous for some, Ms. Phillips said, while other readers are put off by the brash tone and overt partisanship of mass-market tabloids like The Sun, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, or The Daily Mirror, which is also owned by Trinity Mirror.

""Our readers are time poor,"" Ms. Phillips said of The New Day's target audience, ""and they don't like being told what to think."" Still, analysts said, persuading consumers to switch back to buying print media from a newsstand is no small challenge. ""By definition, these are lapsed newspaper readers,"" said Mr. McCabe of Enders Analysis. ""Even if their hypothesis is correct, the reality is most people are consuming news on mobile devices. That requires a big change in habits."" If The New Day's initial sales figures are anything to go by, those digital habits die hard. Although The New Day sold as many as 150,000 daily copies at a discounted price of 25 pence in early March, its sales have since fallen precipitously, according to British media reports, to fewer than 90,000 copies. Trinity Mirror declined to confirm those early figures, citing plans to publish audited sales figures later in the spring. The company has said it expected to turn a profit by the end of the year. And while it does have some advertising, its business model is circulation driven.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions.
* $15 minimum wage for federal contractors will take effect Jan. 30. Ms. Phillips said she was aware that sales had fallen off since the newspaper's initial marketing push, but she added that this was unsurprising. ""It was never going to be easy to launch a new print product,"" she said.

""If you're trying to launch a new print product today, then it's crucial that it becomes something people are talking about,"" she said. ""The reality is that, for most people, those kinds of conversations are happening online."" The New Day has turned to social media as a promotional tool, broadcasting screen shots of its front page and teasers about specific articles. But so far, its social audience -- 47,000 on Facebook, 12,000 on Twitter -- remains a fraction of what most newspapers with shareable digital content are able to attract. Still, not all analysts are ready to dismiss The New Day as a doomed experiment. By forgoing digital, Mr. McCabe said, The New Day avoids the problem of having to stretch scarce newsroom resources across multiple platforms. ""Publishers today are always trying to balance a print and an online strategy as if somehow it is all going to be the same thing,"" Mr. McCabe said. ""Everyone feels like they are compromising."" That balancing act is proving increasingly tricky for many British newspapers. Faced with a 25 percent drop in print revenue last year, the Guardian Media Group, which has invested heavily in a digital and overseas expansion of its flagship newspaper, The Guardian, last month confirmed plans to cut 250 jobs, about 13 percent of its work force. In the meantime, The Times of London, another Murdoch paper, said last week that it was abandoning coverage of breaking news and focusing its resources on producing commentary and analysis. Updates to the newspaper's website, which is being merged with that of its sister paper, The Sunday Times, will be reduced to three times a day.

But even a low-cost newspaper needs a loyal readership to survive, and analysts said The New Day's decision to target a broad, general-interest audience, while perhaps appealing to many advertisers, meant that it would struggle to differentiate itself from titles -- including free ones like Metro and The Evening Standard -- aimed at a similar readership. ""The challenge is to be better than what's already out there,"" Ms. Singer said. ""Whatever your platform strategy is, you still have to have the goods."" With a photo-driven design and colorful typography, The New Day strikes a punchy, conversational tone. Articles and columns are brief and frequently paired with vivid charts or graphics. Ms. Phillips added that editors usually strove for a ""positive"" story mix -- even on days when the top news was decidedly somber, like the recent terrorist attacks in Brussels. Ms. Phillips said she remained encouraged by positive comments the paper was getting from readers so far -- but she acknowledged that the feedback was coming primarily online. That kind of ""postdigital"" reader engagement, she said, suggests that there is still room for successful experimentation in print publishing. ""It's not just about the news. It is about the experience,"" Ms. Phillips said. ""For many people, going to a Facebook page for the news is pretty unfulfilling.""","Britain's newest newspaper doesn't have a website or an app. Instead, its publisher believes that readers haven't yet lost their appetite for newsprint.",df965728-bce5-5bec-ae29-7205fbedeca7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/02/business/04newday1/04newday1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=01e170f9de8293acc0464a4b318fd63845412d63634c65f3bba029ce3749a592&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The New Day, Britain's newest media start-up, is print-only and sells for 50 pence, or about 70 cents, at newsstands.",df965728-bce5-5bec-ae29-7205fbedeca7,N24News/imgs/df965728-bce5-5bec-ae29-7205fbedeca7.jpg,16
Style,Where the Real Los Angeles Meets the Dream,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/style/sunset-boulevard-los-angeles.html,"On Sunset Boulevard, two Californias -- the lived place and the one seen on screen -- run parallel for 22 snaking miles.

Where the Real Los Angeles Meets the Dream

Like Broadway in New York and Ocean Drive in Miami,  It's where you go to gas up at the Arco station (5007 Sunset Boulevard) or grab a meal at In-N-Out Burger (7009 Sunset), and also to chase the dream of fame and eternal sunshine. Remarkably, Sunset lives up to the postcard. Drive east to west, from where the street begins downtown to where it ends 22 twisting miles later at the Pacific Ocean, and at any point along the route, you will see the images that movies, TV shows and magazines have implanted in your brain.

In Hollywood, there are always weird Hollywood people, and tourists hoping to see weird Hollywood people, walking around near where Sunset meets Vine. The Sunset Strip does in fact have giant billboards in the sky advertising the latest blockbuster movie and all the famous nightclubs whose names (The Roxy, 9009 Sunset; the Viper Room, 8852 Sunset) you may know from watching ""E! True Hollywood Story.""

When you see the line of tall palm trees arcing over the pink facade of the Beverly Hills Hotel (9641 Sunset), the whole thing becomes undeniable: Sunset Boulevard is a visual cliche of itself. Is that so bad? Not at all. It can even be strange and wonderful and moving, as shown through these photographs by Jake Michaels, who drove the length of Sunset with his camera. He wanted to capture the ""microcultures"" the boulevard passes through on its journey to the beach. But in documenting daily life there, Mr. Michaels inevitably captured the myth, too.

Shooting from inside his car, on a bright day, he found a guy in black leather astride a motorcycle, waiting for a light to change near the Hollywood Palladium (6215 Sunset). ""The Palladium in the background, the motorcycle, the palm trees, the blue sky -- it's almost like the establishing shot in a movie,"" Mr. Michaels said. Deeper into West Hollywood, he encountered two rocker guys in a black Corvette Stingray, looking like they'd just left band rehearsal for Faster Pussycat. For some, it will forever be 1986 on the Sunset Strip. There's an odd timelessness to the image -- an evocation of the real-life present and an eternal music video of the mind.

Farther east, in Echo Park, another sneakily haunting image surfaced: a man and woman cruising in an old burgundy Ford Galaxie 500, California car culture personified. He looks laid-back cool behind the wheel in sunglasses and a Curtis Mayfield leather cap. But with its sun streaks, soft focus and off-kilter framing, the photo has a fleeting, ethereal quality. Like a ghost image of the east side 30 years earlier, before the waves of gentrification, or the present moment glimpsed in its impermanence.

Mr. Michaels's most self-reflective image in his estimation was one he took outside Amoeba Music (6400 Sunset), back in Hollywood. He spotted a teenage couple there one night and began talking to them. It was the couple's anniversary, they told him. They'd come to buy records, and couldn't wait to go home and listen to music together. Photographed walking and holding hands, the boy wears a kind of military jacket and a wisp of mustache, the girl a vintage fur coat and waves of long brown curls. Like the rockers, they are present-day figures from another decade. It could be 1974, or 2018. As Mr. Michaels put it: ""The future goes on, but the past stays present.""

It brought him back to his own teenage years hanging out on the Sunset Strip in the early 2000s, and confirmed how some places enliven and elevate otherwise typical moments. A couple of regular teenagers out together becomes an iconic portrait of young love. Why? Because it's on Sunset Boulevard.","On Sunset Boulevard, two Californias — the lived place and the one seen on screen — run parallel for 22 snaking miles.",a5beabc2-0797-56ce-b2c7-33cd7c1b3dd0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/21/fashion/21THELOOK4/21THELOOK4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=b1a2935faf642265684a26cbc30b4b19ebc5617acbff1e961d69e69ce7c7d7ae&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles is both a real street and a myth.,a5beabc2-0797-56ce-b2c7-33cd7c1b3dd0,N24News/imgs/a5beabc2-0797-56ce-b2c7-33cd7c1b3dd0.jpg,15

Kate, you're incredible, and thank you so much. I know how hard, I hate being asked to do things like this, so thank you for doing this. Thank you for flying here, thank you for writing something, thank you for the amazing, the words that you said. Thank you so much, I love you. Thank you so much to the Hollywood Foreign Press, I feel humbled and honored to receive this. The first person after Carol Burnett is quite an honor, so thank you so much.

It's a prestigious award, and what I like most about it is I knew coming in I would win. Because I mean, there's nothing worse than sitting there, like most of you, waiting and wondering if you're going to win, and politely acting like, oh, I'm going to listen to everyone's speeches, like it's nice, and it's not. Those people just go on and on and on and on and on, and on and on and on and you're like, aah. I'm not going to do that; I'm going to be quick. Although I don't have to, because it's a special award, and they don't play me off. I mean, I don't have to end at all, because it's a special award. But they said they were going to give me a sign at 25 minutes, but that's for my reference just to see where I was. But I could go on. I'm not. I'm going to keep it quick.

I was born in New Orleans in 1958, Jan. 26. Dr. Swanson delivered me at 8:43 in the morning. A rainy, rainy, and not -- I mean, Louisiana heavy rain. My parents drove me home in a Buick. I think it was a Buick. It could have been a Ford or a Chrysler. It was a Buick. I think it was a Buick. The point is they brought me home in a car, and before I knew it I had a successful sitcom, and I came out, and then I lost that sitcom, and then I got another sitcom, and I lost that sitcom, too. And then I got to do something that I had never been able to do before, and that is make my own whiskey. And after that, I got a talk show and I was able to be myself. And that was 17 years ago. And I feel like you've all really gotten to know me over the past 17 years. I am an open book. And I couldn't have done it without my husband, Mark. Mark, you are my rock. Thank you for supporting me through this crazy journey. I know it wasn't easy for you, or the kids: Rupert and Fiona, go to bed, I love you. That's funny, because they're in college now.

But the point is you all know me, and obviously you know me or else you wouldn't have laughed at all that. I feel like we all think we know someone; there's a connection when we watch someone on TV for as long as they are on TV, and that's what it was like for me with Carol Burnett. I felt like I knew her, I felt like she showed us who she was every week. She was larger than life. We counted on her to make us feel good, and she delivered. Every single week, she never let us down. She was hilarious in all the sketches that she did, and when she did the Q. and A. with the audience, she was just genuine and personal, and I always felt like she was speaking to me. At the end of the show, every time she pulled her ear, I knew she was saying, 'It's O.K. I'm gay, too.' Television, it inspired and influenced everything that I am today. Lucille Ball, Mary Tyler Moore, Marlo Thomas, Dick van Dyke, Bob Newhart ... there's a little bit of all of them in me. That didn't sound right, but you know what I'm saying.

All I ever want to do is make people feel good and laugh, and there is no greater feeling than when someone tells me that I've made their day better with my show, or that I've helped them get through a sickness or a hard time in their lives. But the real power of television for me is not that people watch my show, but that people watch my show and then they're inspired to go out and do the same thing in their own lives: They make people laugh or be kind or help someone that is less fortunate than themselves. And that is the power of television and I'm so, so grateful to be a part of it. Thank you so much, everybody.","""There is no greater feeling than when someone tells me that I've made their day better with my show,"" the comedian said in her acceptance speech Sunday night.",b95c9ce6-f950-5124-bc2e-624a6394b894,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/05/arts/05globes-ellen1/05globes-ellen1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=52d6eb4077ca0563e7ff91be2b88d5f3894a06b69a841d706322d52b8d1da81d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Ellen DeGeneres accepting the Carol Burnett TV Achievement Award at the Golden Globes.,b95c9ce6-f950-5124-bc2e-624a6394b894,N24News/imgs/b95c9ce6-f950-5124-bc2e-624a6394b894.jpg,3
Opinion,"Saving the Economy, and Saving Lives",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/opinion/letters/us-coronavirus-trump.html,"We could rejoice at President Trump's suggestion that perhaps the lockdown of much of America has been overdone. But why would we? When someone who exhibits absolutely zero empathy suggests that an economic shock would be worse than the deaths from Covid-19, it is clearly replete with self-interest.

The state of the economy was one of the few things Mr. Trump had going for him in his bid for re-election. Now he wants us to risk our lives and those of our loved ones to save his political life? I don't think so.

The president of the United States is unqualified to decide a critical issue -- whether the nation should relax public health restrictions addressing the spread of Covid-19. By stating that physicians would shut the country for years if they could, the president again demonstrated his disdain for the truth when it doesn't align with his belief system.

Practicing medicine without a license is a crime for good reason. In this critical moment it should be obvious to all that the collective advice of our nation's public health experts trumps the opinion of one self-proclaimed dealmaker.",Readers are fearful that the president will ease isolation measures to help his re-election bid.,3f140d67-b4ca-509b-85c9-ab8e9e4b127f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/23/us/politics/23dc-virus-trump-sub1/23dc-virus-trump-sub1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=f9e24aa52bfd966504c2c70879d168cf5886728e045cf3f0d69b0ceb3636287a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,President Trump speaking Sunday at a coronavirus task force news conference in Washington.,3f140d67-b4ca-509b-85c9-ab8e9e4b127f,N24News/imgs/3f140d67-b4ca-509b-85c9-ab8e9e4b127f.jpg,11

""Portrait of George Dyer in a Mirror"" (1968) shows Francis Bacon's lover, who died of a drug and alcohol overdose in 1971.





Francis Bacon Read Just as He Painted: Deep, Dark and Bleak

PARIS -- If good artists borrow while the great ones steal, then Francis Bacon was a particularly savvy thief. His list of artistic influences is a mile long, from Diego Velazquez's dark Catholic imagery to Picasso's fragmented perspectives. But perhaps more than any painterly influence, literature shaped Bacon's art. He thrived off the tragedies, the ideas and the fictions of others. ""I call it my imagination material,"" he told the French photographer Francis Giacobetti in 1991, during his last interview, referring to his immense collection of books and photographs. ""I need to visualize things that lead me to other forms, that lead me to visualize forms that lead me to other forms or subjects, details, images that influence my nervous system and transform the basic idea.""

""I had the sense that some of these books, put together, could give a real sense of Bacon's project,"" said Didier Ottinger, the show's curator. ""I thought, 'Wow, this man is not using books as decoration.'"" Bacon had an enormous library in his London studio, where books were scattered among shelves and on the floor. Since his death in 1992, about 1,300 of them now belong to Trinity College in Dublin. Bacon read, marked up and often memorized the works of Aeschylus, Shakespeare, Jean Racine, Balzac, Nietzsche, Georges Bataille, Freud, T.S. Eliot, Joseph Conrad, Proust and others. In a 1966 interview with the British art critic David Sylvester, the painter said he knew some of them ""by heart."" Michael Peppiatt, a friend and biographer of Bacon, said in a telephone interview that, ""Like his taste for the very great artists, like Michelangelo and Velasquez, his literary icons also tended to be monuments.""

Mr. Peppiatt, who befriended Bacon in 1963, added that some of the painter's favorites -- Proust's ""In Search of Lost Time,"" Eliot's ""Four Quartets"" and Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" -- were ""isolated peaks of literature, and Bacon was his own kind of isolated peak."" A thread that connects the writers he loved is that they stood against the values of their time, opposing dogmas, whether religious or political. Like Bacon, they wouldn't be dictated to.

For the artist, this was perhaps because his early life was stifled by conformity. Bacon was born into a posh family in Dublin in 1909: His father, Anthony Edward, was a military captain, and his mother, Christina, an heiress to a coal and steel fortune. Family relations were tense, especially with his father, who discovered the teenage Bacon dressing in women's clothes several times. Bacon left home on poor terms with his family, in 1926, and settled in London two years later. His homosexuality and, later, his atheism would keep him at odds with his conservative family throughout his life. He was in near-constant search of a father figure, using prostitutes and lovers in this quest and frequently entering into abusive relationships.

""He quite liked stark, tragic stories because he thought of his life as quite a stark, tragic story,"" Mr. Peppiatt said. ""He looked for other people who'd also looked down into the darkness."" Bataille's writings helped open Bacon to his sexuality; Nietzsche gave him a path to existential meaning without religious conviction; and Aeschylus gave Bacon a grand way to conceive of his own personal tragedies, which included the death of his partner of about eight years, George Dyer, of a drug and alcohol overdose. Aeschylus, in particular, had a special place in Bacon's life. No writer, he believed, captured tragedy quite as he did. In 1985, he told an interviewer on British television that a phrase from the Greek playwright, ""The reek of human blood smiles out at me,"" evoked in him ""the most exciting images."" Bacon's ""Second Version of Triptych 1944,"" from 1988 -- a triptych of disembodied mouths and sets of ghoulish teeth that's on show at the Pompidou -- combined Bacon's love for Aeschylus' violent phrase with the sexual frankness of Bataille's writings. Mr. Ottinger said this painting was, like so many of the works in the exhibition, an indirect investigation of Bacon's personal demons: in this case, his sexuality and Dyer's death .

At other times Bacon's influences show more subtly. Mr. Ottinger said that in ""Study from the Human Body and Portrait,"" from 1988, Bacon took inspiration from Eliot's multiplicity of poetic fragments in ""The Waste Land"" to make a multilayered painting with aerosol paint and a dry transfer lettering. This mirrored the epic poem's ""fragmented construction and its collage of languages and multiple tales,"" he said. Catherine Howe, an art historian who specializes in Bacon, said in a telephone interview that the painter was ""interested in this kind of Modernist rule-breaking, how one formally goes about altering painting to convey a sensation."" ""He used to quote from Valery and say, 'I'm conveying the related sensation without the boredom of its conveyance,' which is a very modern notion of bypassing narrative,"" she added.

Around that time, he said, Bacon described himself as being ""like a grinding machine: Everything goes in and gets ground up very fine."" Bacon had a bleak outlook on life, Mr. Peppiatt said, and his favorite books and poems confirmed this.","A new exhibition at the Centre Pompidou in Paris looks at how literary figures like Eliot, Conrad and Aeschylus shaped the painter's work.",fb6ff855-8f2d-5773-adf1-3d12a1cd3055,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/19/arts/11bacon6/11bacon6-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=05a983f81646e2d4fa1e1748f5c8111770d739632dcbdf3bc32f620c4dd57fc4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"&ldquo;Portrait of George Dyer in a Mirror&rdquo; (1968) shows Francis Bacon&rsquo;s lover, who died of a drug and alcohol overdose in 1971.",fb6ff855-8f2d-5773-adf1-3d12a1cd3055,N24News/imgs/fb6ff855-8f2d-5773-adf1-3d12a1cd3055.jpg,14
Style,Paul Marciano Will Leave Guess After Sexual Harassment Settlements,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/style/guess-harassment-resignation.html,"After being the subject of an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment and assault, Paul Marciano has resigned from his position as executive chairman of Guess Inc.'s board, according to the company's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Mr. Marciano, who will be replaced by his brother Maurice Marciano, will remain on the board through the end of his contract. Mr. Marciano, a founder of the company, had forfeited his salary during the period of the investigation, but will receive a salary from June 11 until the expiration of his contract on Jan. 30, 2019.

According to the filing, ""allegations against Mr. Marciano included claims of inappropriate comments and texts, and unwanted advances including kissing and groping."" During the last several months, investigators who were hired by the board interviewed more than 40 people and reviewed approximately 1.5 million pages of documents, the filing said.

Guess and Mr. Marciano signed nonconfidential settlement agreements for the amount of $500,000 with five women who had accused Mr. Marciano of sexual harassment. ""This was a very powerful man whose pattern, according to my clients, was reaching out to women who were aspiring models, getting them very hopeful that they were going to get a job as the next Guess girl, groping their breasts and when they rebuffed him, of course they didn't get a job,"" said Lisa Bloom, a lawyer who represented four of the women in the settlements. ""A person who would do that is not fit to serve. Guess is a company that primarily sells to women and should be making a strong statement condemning his behavior.""","Five women who accused the co-founder of unwanted attention or touching will receive $500,000 in total.",8ecddda0-8850-50ad-af3e-a986b170a6f5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/fashion/13GUESS/13GUESS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=8ecb6333ce97053060306db32e1238b9bf38f2d32dbc8e6572995dc14a47e60a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Paul Marciano, at left, with Maurice Marciano in 2015.",8ecddda0-8850-50ad-af3e-a986b170a6f5,N24News/imgs/8ecddda0-8850-50ad-af3e-a986b170a6f5.jpg,15
Television,'The Good Lord Bird' Is a New Entry in the John Brown Canon,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/arts/television/the-good-lord-bird-john-brown.html,"""I'm still in recovery from the president of the United States not condemning white supremacy,"" Ethan Hawke said the morning after the first Biden-Trump debate. ""That's an easy thing to condemn."" For Hawke, disavowing white supremacy was not just a matter of responsible leadership or simply the right thing any American citizen should do. It was the defining ideology of John Brown, the white abolitionist the actor is currently playing in Showtime's ""The Good Lord Bird."" Hawke said Brown was the most challenging, rewarding and politically urgent character he had played in his 35-year acting career. ""It's like getting to be King Lear, but even better,"" he said in a recent phone interview. ""It's playing a King Lear that hasn't really been played."" Hawke also created, with Mark Richard, the seven-part mini-series, which is based on the 2013 National Book Award novel of the same name by the Black writer James McBride.

Part satire, part historical fiction, both versions are told from the point-of-view of the fictional character Henry Shackleford, who introduces himself after telling us that Brown rescued him from slavery as a boy. Mistaking him for an adolescent girl, Brown calls him Henrietta or, more often, by the nickname Onion, and they travel together throughout the United States and Canada on Brown's antislavery crusade, culminating in a raid on a military arsenal in Harpers Ferry, Va. (now part of West Virginia) on Oct. 16, 1859. For McBride, the story of John Brown shaped his childhood. ""I remember my older brothers talking about John Brown trying to start some kind of provisional government,"" McBride said. His church still sang ""John Brown's Body,"" a 19th century marching song popularized by Black Union regiments during the Civil War and sung in Emancipation Day festivities and later adapted by professional choral groups of the era, like the Fisk Jubilee Singers. (The author ultimately felt comfortable with two white men adapting his book partly because ""Mark was a Southerner, and he really understood Southern things,"" he told The New York Times Magazine. ""He understands the familiarity between whites and Blacks in the South."") Hawke, on the other hand, spent his early years in Texas ""hearing he was a nut,"" he said of Brown. It's a common divergence. These differences in a collective memory, in which John Brown appears either as a martyr who willingly sacrificed himself and his family to end slavery or as a madman who violently murdered his fellow white Americans, have traditionally been divided along racial lines. Like McBride, I was raised to believe Brown was not just a hero but an exception: a rare white abolitionist who not only believed that African-Americans should not be enslaved but also that they were his equal.

A few years later, Hollywood began cementing Brown's image as an uncontrollable maniac. In the 1940 film ""Santa Fe Trail,"" based on the biography of the Confederate officer J.E.B Stuart, the actor Raymond Massey played Brown as wild-eyed, irrational and impulsive. In his essay ""Black People's Ally, White People's Bogeyman,"" the historian Louis A. DeCaro Jr. noted that upon the movie's release, one of Brown's grandchildren unsuccessfully tried to sue Warner Brothers for ""vilifying misrepresentation."" Strangely, 15 years later, Massey played Brown again, a bit softened and only slightly more sympathetic, in the movie, ""Seven Angry Men."" In the 1971 comedy western ""Skin Game,"" a chest-length-beard-wearing John Brown appears so crazed that any gains to be made when he disrupts a live slave auction are undermined by the ensuing chaos that he produces in the town. Hawke prepared for his role by reading the letters Brown wrote from jail in the week before his execution. ""They're not the scratches of a lunatic,"" Hawke said. ""They're the writings of a person with a cause, somebody who has something to die for, and somebody who's not confused that we're all made from the same creator."" In order to externalize Brown's own emotional reality and character growth, Hawke focused on the beard, which Brown originally grew as a disguise but which artists often portray as his defining feature. ""I got obsessed with the beard because I knew that iconography of that Noah-esque beard,"" Hawke said. ""So I came up with this idea that I'd start being clean shaven and then just grow the beard throughout. I hope to show he's becoming John Brown, and that he's not finished when we meet him.""

Hawke's own fascination with John Brown began in 2015 while shooting on set in Louisiana for Antoine Fuqua's ""Magnificent Seven."" While there, a cameraman suggested that Hawke read ""The Good Lord Bird"" and that he should one day consider playing Brown. After reading it, Hawke became an evangelist for the novel. ""I shared that book with everybody,"" he said. ""It is so painful to talk about our past in this country that we just don't like doing it -- we want to move on."" ""But I thought that McBride pulled off a magic trick, which is that he told the story about slavery,"" Hawke continued, ""with so much love, and so much wit, so much silliness, human stupidity and human folly."" Part of what makes the story compelling is also McBride's irreverent depiction of icons like the abolitionist Frederick Douglass, played in the series by Daveed Diggs (""Hamilton""). The renowned orator, who in real-life posed for at least 160 images and was perhaps the most photographed American of his time, is presented as an image obsessed Black Dandy who lives with both his Black wife, Anna, and his white mistress, Helen. Not since Jewell Parker Rhodes's 2002 novel, ""Douglass' Women"" has the messiness of Douglass's domestic life been so cheekily depicted. ""We had fun with the Frederick Douglass character,"" McBride said. ""We don't mean any disrespect to him and to the many thousands of historians who revere him and then the millions of people who revere his memory. But his life was rife for caricature."" ""He is considered almost godlike in terms of what he has done for the African-American and American community,"" McBride continued. ""But what about the man who gave his life and whose one act changed the course of American history? If Harpers Ferry hadn't happened, there's a good argument to be made that the Civil War would have been pushed back 10 or 15 or 20 years.""

Brown's raid, of course, did not end up being the slave-rebellion-igniting spark that he envisioned. After briefly taking the armory, he and his 21 men were overwhelmed and 10 of them, Black and white, were killed. (Sixteen people were killed in all.) Two of Brown's sons were among the dead, and the man himself was arrested, tried and publicly hanged. In ""The Good Lord Bird,"" Henry is able to reveal his true self as well as express his eternal debt to Brown, right before the old man's execution. Today, an unassuming stone obelisk stands at the site of Brown's raid at Harpers Ferry to commemorate the stand he took. But, instead of offering an image of Brown, its facade is blank, making it possible for people to project onto it their own interpretation of him and the different hopes and fears he represents for different people and races. But the lack of imagery also makes it far easier for us to forget Brown the actual man -- and to a certain degree, the myth. Hawke challenged himself to erect a different monument to Brown's life. Not one that is stoic or static, but rather a moving image that aimed to present Brown as unbridled in his pursuit of justice for all. In his 2005 edited collection of essays ""The Afterlife of John Brown,"" Eldrid Herrington, a professor of English, wrote, ""John Brown's body revives whenever the United States shames itself, when the body politic bears wounds, when it imprisons citizens without trial, or prosecutes an unjust war in an unjust manner."" In other words, John Brown reappears at peak moments of peril as a warning, and to help us find a way through it. Originally, Showtime planned to debut ""The Good Lord Bird"" in February but ended up pushing it back first to August, and then October, without specifying why.",The Showtime mini-series is the latest work to take up the question of whether the 19th-century abolitionist was a martyr or a madman. The answers tend to break along racial lines.,75c096f8-e102-5d80-ab9a-ec97ef4a4889,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/13/arts/13johnbrown-1/13johnbrown-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a925164bf69a5d065d05141d2d7c43b1f6901fb00f5c0b6d1864e1e982a7c0ca&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ethan Hawke read John Brown's letters from jail to prepare for playing him in ""The Good Lord Bird.""

Your Money,Private Equity-Like Fund Aims to Speed Up Diabetes Research,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/28/your-money/philanthropy-type-1-diabetes-research-fund.html,"Dave Johnson says his immediate reaction to his daughter's diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes at age 4 was typical of any father's. ""It was my baby girl, and my response was I'm going to fix it or pay someone to fix it,"" said Mr. Johnson, president and chief executive of the hotel management company Aimbridge Hospitality. ""I dove in, spoke to some smart people. But then, I was hit between the eyes that there wasn't a lot that I was going to be able to do."" That was 22 years ago, and what he did do was volunteer with gusto, organizing fund-raisers in the Dallas area where he lived and working his way up to membership on the executive committee of the international board of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, the main nonprofit group making grants and evaluating research on the disease. But recently, Mr. Johnson did something that appealed to his business side: He and his wife gave $1 million to a new nonprofit organization, the foundation's T1D Fund, which invests in companies doing research into Type 1 diabetes. Any financial returns are used to make more investments.

""The fund is extremely transparent and crystal clear in its mission,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""We have a quarterly call and get updates when we're making investments. It's run similar to a for-profit."" Structured like a private equity fund, the T1D Fund has a minimum donation of $500,000. The fund, which received $32 million in seed funding from the foundation, has a goal of reaching $80 million. It already has $55 million. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that attacks the pancreas and its ability to produce insulin, while Type 2 is a metabolic condition that affects how the body uses glucose. Type 1 also affects fewer people -- about 200,000 new cases a year compared with three million for Type 2. Given the number of those affected, Type 2 diabetes has attracted ample funding, while Type 1, which is generally diagnosed in children, has attracted fewer resources. The fund's goal is not only to attract more money for research into the disease, but also to move faster than a foundation and speed along advances in treatments. Given the nature of life science research, the fund's backers point to the possibility of advances in research into other autoimmune diseases. While those advances would not directly affect people with Type 1 diabetes, they could bring returns to the fund that could then be reinvested in different companies.

""The fund makes very quick decisions from start to finish,"" said Ellen Leake, vice chairwoman of the foundation's international board, which has also agreed to cover all operating expenses over the next four years. In 2015, the foundation asked Sean Doherty, general counsel of the private equity fund Bain Capital, to create a nonprofit fund and to be its chairman. The goal was to use a different structure to speed new technologies and products to market. ""There was a lot of money on the sidelines that wasn't giving,"" said Mr. Doherty, whose son, Finn, has Type 1 diabetes. Because the foundation funds 70 percent of the nongovernment money going to Type 1 diabetes research, he added, ""you were kind of throwing your money into a very large pond, and that created a donor disconnect."" The new fund aims to invest all of its money in four years. ""We've created a vehicle that has 100 percent concentration risk in one disease that affects 1.5 million Americans, and there is no investment return track record,"" Mr. Doherty said. ""Doing so philanthropically, we have the luxury to take that risk."" Perhaps not surprisingly, it has attracted donors who have made their money in finance and business and are comfortable with risk. John Mallory, a partner in the investment management division at Goldman Sachs in Los Angeles, said he wasn't attracted to the foundation's model, which relies heavily on fund-raising through events like walks and galas, when he learned his son had Type 1 diabetes almost three years ago. Mr. Mallory initially thought of investing directly in an insulin therapy company, but thought better of it given his lack of knowledge of companies researching diabetes treatments.

When he heard about the new fund, he said, he and his wife immediately wanted to participate. ""What the fund was good at doing was saying, 'We're going to try to fill some of that gap,'"" he said. ""'We're going to back some of the companies even if they don't have the same investment potential. We're going to do it at an earlier stage.'"" The T1D Fund is also using the imprimatur of the foundation's researchers and its own due diligence process to act as a stamp of approval for the companies it invests in. Ashleigh Palmer, chief executive of Provention Bio, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company in New Jersey that is working on vaccines, including one for Type 1 diabetes, said he raised $28 million in a recent fund-raising round, with a comparatively small amount coming from the T1D Fund. ""We'll benefit enormously from their network and their know-how and the doors they can open for us,"" Mr. Palmer said. The T1D Fund has announced seven investments of $1 million to $2.5 million since the beginning of the year, Mr. Doherty said. As is the case with other nonprofit groups, donors are asked to give their knowledge in addition to money. Mr. Mallory has been working to identify other donors with a connection to Type 1 diabetes in the Los Angeles area. Jay Eastman, who runs the private equity fund EG Capital in New York, and his wife, Katama Eastman, have been enlisted for their expertise and networking skills. Mr. Eastman said he had talked to Mr. Doherty and Jonathan Behr, the managing director of the fund, about investments.

Ms. Eastman, who is the president of the New York branch of the foundation, had great success raising money from her friends and families at events. But the fund, she said, allowed their families to come together and make a large gift. (They would not disclose the amount.) The Eastmans are motivated by the fund's ability to speed technologies along. Their daughter, Merrill, was 15 months old in 2004 when they learned she had Type 1 diabetes. She recently received a monitoring system that measures blood glucose and then releases the right amount of insulin. It had been in the works for years. ""When she was diagnosed, doctors' offices and manufacturers said it was two years away,"" Ms. Eastman said. ""Having a fund that was going to go and get these things more quickly was big."" But an approach like this, which falls broadly into social impact philanthropy, carries some caveats. ""The pros are the potential for larger amounts of money raised more efficiently -- or a class of potential investors who will be less attracted to the world of donations than the world of investments,"" Leslie Lenkowsky, a professor of philanthropic studies at Indiana University, said. ""The negatives are the organization really has to prove that it can do things."" ""To the extent the return is blended between social value and financial value, measuring the social value is difficult and very long term,"" he added. There is also the risk that the money disappears without much to show for it. But Ms. Leake, who is on the foundation's international board, said the new fund ""is a little bit different because it's looking for viability and commercial uptake where a basic research grant is just about the learning."" ""Certainly the downside risk would be the perception that we would take riskier bets,"" she added. ""But stacked up against research grants, we're willing to put our money out there for the learning that comes from the investment."" For its backers, though, this is about scientific advancement. ""Selfishly, I'd like to make a difference in my daughter's life,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""But my heartstrings have also been torn by children whose parents don't have the resources my wife and I do. These are great young people, and we've got to give them a shot.""","The goal of the T1D Fund, which received $32 million in seed funding from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, is to speed new products to market.",2ab97f70-bc8c-507e-890a-017b7470a3e0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/28/business/29WEALTH/29WEALTH-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=a38c742c789827be9de14ed8cc7cb20b660ff667c374178d41522b078966984d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sean Doherty, the chairman of the T1D Fund, which invests in companies doing research into Type 1 diabetes, with his son, Finn, who has the disease.",2ab97f70-bc8c-507e-890a-017b7470a3e0,N24News/imgs/2ab97f70-bc8c-507e-890a-017b7470a3e0.jpg,21
Media,'A Big Correction': Pandemic Brings Change to 'Bloated' Ad Industry,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/business/media/coronavirus-pandemic-advertising-industry.html,"A Chipotle ad was shot in Idaho at ""a fraction of what a full-blown production would have cost,"" according to its chief marketing officer.





The advertising industry's tendency toward excess -- catered parties in Las Vegas headlined by pop stars; unwieldy internal hierarchies stuffed with countless director roles; throw-it-at-the-wall ad placement -- has persisted for years despite concerns about wastefulness. The pandemic may force all of that to change. Some people in the industry say a correction was necessary. Marketing budgets have dwindled as the coronavirus led to nationwide lockdowns and canceled events, and customers are no longer in the mood for flashy TV commercials or bright, cheerful billboards. The research firm Forrester predicted last week that advertising spending in the United States would decline by 25 percent this year and would not recover until 2023. For Twitter, advertising revenue fell 23 percent in the most recent quarter. Now the platform has said it is looking into subscriptions and other ways to make money that do not depend on ads. The ad giant Omnicom Group said on Tuesday that revenue in its second quarter slumped nearly 25 percent and that the decline ""is expected to continue for the remainder of the year."" Like many of its peers, it laid off 6,100 employees, shed more than 1 million square feet of space, froze hiring and implemented some pay cuts.

In place of the pre-pandemic parties and dinners, the longtime advertising executive Gaston Legorburu has been going ""from war room to war room"" at Fortune 500 companies, where he said he found many advertising plans and marketing departments in limbo. His agency, Glue IQ, has placed interim workers at companies that have cut back their staffs. ""There's a big correction -- a lot of these teams have gotten too big and too bloated,"" he said. ""They're now having the realization that they can do twice as much with half as many people.""

While the industry tightens, the ads it produces have become simpler and more practical. Campaigns are often produced quickly and on the cheap as companies have tried to adjust to the initial shock of lockdown, worldwide civil rights protests and the seesaw of reopenings that have sometimes been interrupted by new outbreaks. More clients have asked that their ads be made by and feature a more diverse group of people, while also demanding more evidence that the ads are effective. Agencies have experimented with digital tools to help brands stay relevant, such as a ""tension map"" that analyzes online conversations around the country.

""This is an industry that is constantly talking about wanting to transform itself, but that is also constantly sticking to very traditional approaches,"" said Marcelo Pascoa, the vice president for marketing for the beer brand Coors. ""Old habits die hard, but people are being forced out of necessity to adapt faster."" In 2020 and 2021, agencies will shed 52,000 jobs, according to Jay Pattisall, an analyst with Forrester. Half the jobs will not return, he predicted. Last week, the agency Wieden & Kennedy laid off 11 percent of its work force, citing ""an impasse"" with the pandemic. Havas, another large ad company that laid off employees, said that recovering ""will undoubtedly take more time than hoped.""
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""There will be fewer and smaller agencies that are just as capable, if not more capable, because they'll lean on technology for basic tasks -- like a bot that takes notes for you during a call, that processes the paperwork to hire an influencer for a campaign, or does audience analysis for a media planner,"" Mr. Pattisall said. Other work may go to part-time contractors, as companies seek flexibility, said Kenny Tomlin, who recently co-founded the digital agency CourtAvenue. Mr. Tomlin has helped connect Fortune 100 brands with ""pre-tired"" marketing professionals -- workers who are on the cusp of retirement but still want occasional work. ""There are a lot of client engagements right now that are project-based, where they don't want to sign multiyear retainment agreements, and they don't know what their long-term budgets are,"" Mr. Tomlin said.

The pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests have forced many companies to take a hard look at their marketing strategies. Visa said this month, during what it called ""a time of great introspection and change,"" that it would take bids from ad agencies hoping to become its go-to creative partner. The company, which spent $235 million on marketing in the first quarter of 2020, said it would consider candidates' commitment to diversity in its review.

Coca-Cola is also ""reassessing our overall marketing return on investment on everything from ad viewership across traditional media to improving effectiveness in digital,"" James Quincey, the chief executive, said during a conference call last week. The company will ""be judicious in our use of marketing,"" he added, as it tries to track changes in regional lockdown policies. But there are reasons for optimism. Dentsu, a major advertising holding company, has returned some agency employees to full shifts after moving them to reduced schedules. At the advertising and communications giant WPP, which has had more than 100,000 employees working from home for months, new business plunged early in the pandemic but has since recovered to early 2020 levels. WPP and the rest of the country have ""seen decades of innovation in a few short months,"" said its chief executive, Mark Read. Live sports, a magnet for advertising, may be on their way back, with the National Basketball Association season scheduled to restart July 30 and the National Hockey League set to return Aug. 1. Ad space attached to four games that helped usher in the Major League Baseball season on Saturday quickly sold out, according to Fox Sports. More than 60 advertisers, such as Hankook Tire and Bud Light, participated. But that space may be at risk: More than a dozen Miami Marlins players and coaches have tested positive for the coronavirus after this weekend's games, putting the rest of the shortened season in doubt. Derek Andersen, the chief financial officer of Snap, warned on a conference call last week that the demand for ads in the third quarter of the year had ""historically been bolstered by factors that appear unlikely to materialize in the same way they have in prior years, including the back-to-school season, film release schedules, and the operations of various sports leagues."" The uncertainty has provided a challenge to an industry that tried to gauge the national mood. ""The consumer psyche and what they wanted to hear and needed to hear from brands would just change week to week,"" said Chris Brandt, the chief marketing officer of Chipotle.",The marketing business is going through a period of innovation as it sheds workers and tries to hold on to clients.,2c6f49de-21b4-5003-b2af-1f306aae161e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/29/business/28Virus-Advertising-01/merlin_175000356_bbbf32ca-f875-4a75-9616-75f400e80a9e-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=35cd55bfbb20fb7b555393dc64abf10318991e113ddcd53f5d53ff4ebeabd92b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A Chipotle ad was shot in Idaho at &ldquo;a fraction of what a full-blown production would have cost,&rdquo; according to its chief marketing officer.",2c6f49de-21b4-5003-b2af-1f306aae161e,N24News/imgs/2c6f49de-21b4-5003-b2af-1f306aae161e.jpg,16
Music,Post Malone Out-Streams the Lumineers to Repeat at No. 1,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/arts/music/post-malone-hollywoods-bleeding-billboard.html,"Post Malone, the brooding juggernaut whose third album, ""Hollywood's Bleeding"" (Republic), achieved the year's biggest streaming week on its way to No. 1 last Monday, once again topped the Billboard chart this week with another strong digital performance.

The album, which in its first week moved the equivalent of 489,000 copies, including 365 million streams, dropped 59 percent in its second frame, but tallied another 221 million streams and 26,000 in album sales for a total of 198,000 album units, according to Nielsen Music. Post Malone became the first artist to repeat at No. 1 -- something Tool, Taylor Swift and Young Thug could not do -- since Ed Sheeran in July and early August.

Post Malone, 24, was challenged for the top spot by the folk group the Lumineers, whose new album ""III"" (Dualtone) sold 73,000 copies as a full album -- nearly three times what ""Hollywood's Bleeding"" sold. But the band's new LP had only 16 million streams in its debut week, giving it an opening total of 86,000 album equivalent units, using the industry's formula that combines sales, streams and downloads. (For comparison, Post Malone's previous two albums, released in 2016 and 2018, each had more streams last week than the Lumineers' latest.)","""Hollywood's Bleeding"" racked up the equivalent of 198,000 copies, making the 24-year-old musician the first to repeat at the top since Ed Sheeran this summer.",e25a1187-b029-5511-984f-28ba5d34d930,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/23/arts/23billboard/23billboard-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=559a2c76f330bae46ac7f3307f6e99e956e6ee8ec9baf361c16a302e38541943&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Post Malone's third album, ""Hollywood's Bleeding,"" notched a second week at the top of the Billboard chart.",e25a1187-b029-5511-984f-28ba5d34d930,N24News/imgs/e25a1187-b029-5511-984f-28ba5d34d930.jpg,12
Media,Fox News Led Its Cable Rivals During the Hour of Impeachment,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/business/media/fox-news-impeachment-ratings.html,"As the House of Representatives cast the deciding votes to impeach President Trump on Wednesday, the number of people watching cable news was far greater than usual, according to Nielsen.

Roughly 11 million people tuned into the big-three cable news channels, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC, from 8 to 9 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, significantly more than the average of 5.7 million viewers who watch at that time on a typical night.

The opinion host Tucker Carlson, who called the impeachment ""a disgrace,"" was the lead on-air personality on Fox News as the House members cast their votes. He was joined for a time by the anchor Bret Baier. The Wednesday episode of Mr. Carlson's 8 p.m. show trounced its cable-news rivals, averaging five million viewers during the hour, a 67 percent increase from the usual ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" audience.

At the same time, MSNBC drew 3.2 million viewers, better than the 1.7 million viewers who usually watch the channel at that hour. Brian Williams and Nicolle Wallace anchored the hour, and the usual 8 p.m. MSNBC host, Chris Hayes, offered commentary in favor of impeachment.","Among cable-news networks, MSNBC came in second and CNN third.

Real Estate,House Hunting in Ireland: A Lakeside Victorian Mansion for $2.6 Million,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/realestate/house-hunting-in-ireland-a-lakeside-victorian-mansion-for-2-6-million.html,"This eight-bedroom Victorian mansion, called Kilteelagh House, sits on the southeast shore of Lough Derg, a 32,000-acre lake in County Tipperary, about 100 miles southwest of Dublin, Ireland. Built circa 1863 with the exposed stonework and hipped polychrome slate roof of the High Victorian Gothic style, the 10,904-square-foot house features five reception rooms, soaring ceilings, a finished basement level and an attached courtyard building with an artist's studio and rec rooms. The secluded 25-acre property also includes a barn, garage, equestrian facilities and a substantial boathouse that was once the home of the Lough Derg Yacht Club, which is now based in a neighboring bay, said David Ashmore, a managing director with Ireland Sotheby's International Realty, which has the listing.

The interconnected drawing room and study have wood-burning fireplaces with marble chimney pieces, and the drawing room has a raised seating area with lake views. The dining room has a marble fireplace, plaster ceiling rose and chandelier, while the open-plan kitchen, expanded from what had been three separate rooms, has an island, granite countertops and a cast-iron fireplace. A separate dining area has a solid fuel stove. Beyond the kitchen is a family room with a stove, along with a bedroom and bathroom. The ground floor extends to the courtyard building, which has an artist's studio with double-height ceilings and other rooms. The first-floor stair hall has a large Venetian-style window and ornately carved timber staircase that ascends to a second-floor landing accessing five bedrooms and three bathrooms. The master bedroom has large bay windows overlooking the lake, a coved ceiling, cast-iron fireplace and a dressing room. The finished basement level has several rooms, including two bedrooms, two bathrooms, an office, living room, laundry, boot room and wine cellar. Outside, a terrace with a barbecue pit is surrounded by Victorian-style gardens with seating areas among mature shrubs and trees. The boat house has a harbor and includes two timber pontoons.

Ireland's housing market enjoyed a robust recovery in the years following the global recession of 2008, with prices rising by 82.6 percent from their nadir in early 2013 to April 2020. However, the ascent tapered off considerably in 2019, slowed by stricter lending rules, increasing supply and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. The national residential property price index rose by 0.93 percent from October 2018 to October 2019, down from the previous year's rise of 8.34 percent, according to Ireland's Central Statistics Office. ""The housing market pre-Covid was performing well,"" said Guy Craigie, director of residential Ireland for the Knight Frank brokerage. ""House prices have stabilized over the last year, having shot up for five years after the crash over a decade ago."" Buyers paid a mean of 296,606 euros ($330,000) for a dwelling in the 12 months before April 2020, according to data from the statistics office -- still about 18.1 percent below the peak in 2007. ""The market was becoming more balanced,"" said James Butler, head of country agency Dublin for the Savills brokerage. ""New supply had finally begun to catch up with the pent-up demand and, as a result, we were seeing more orderly and moderate rates of price and rental growth.""

Restrictions imposed to fight the global pandemic ""effectively froze the housing market over the last three months,"" Mr. Craigie said. But with many of those restrictions lifted as of June 8, ""we are beginning to witness a strong rebound in activity,"" he said. Currently, the average house price in Ireland is 304,000 euros ($340,000). In Dublin, the capital, the average is 587,000 euros ($656,000), Mr. Butler said, while ""average farmland values have been very consistent in recent years at around 9,000 euros ($10,100) per acre."" While the International Monetary Fund expects Ireland's economy to contract by 6.8 percent, and the country is seeing a pandemic-adjusted unemployment rate as high as 26.1 percent, according to the statistics office, brokers were generally optimistic about a market recovery. ""We believe we'll see a shortage of supply over the coming months, partially due to the cocooned cohort not wanting to sell, which will act as a break on price declines,"" Mr. Craigie said. ""Most of our clients don't have to sell and won't do so until they both feel safe and that they are getting a fair price."" Country estates, like Kilteelagh House in Tipperary County, may be viewed even more favorably by prospective buyers who were confined in tight urban dwellings during the lockdown, Mr. Ashmore said. Travelers entering Ireland are still required to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival, which may slow the recovery in housing sectors popular with foreign buyers, brokers said.

However, Mr. Ashmore said, ""anticipating a relaxation of this requirement or the availability of testing on entry, many are making tentative travel arrangements in anticipation of being able to travel."" Mr. Craigie said he didn't believe the quarantine was hurting the market, as many prospective buyers are viewing listings remotely, particularly for newly built properties. Foreign buyers seeking larger estates often send a locally based representative, such as a family member, for initial viewings, Mr. Butler said, adding, ""We expect to see more of this in the forthcoming months."" Historically, foreign buyers -- many of them returning Irish expatriates -- accounted for about half of the sales of country estates in Ireland. But the past decade, that's grown to two-thirds, Mr. Ashmore said. ""The U.S. has been the strongest source of foreign buyers in recent years, overtaking the U.K.,"" he said. However, ""the emergence of European-based buyers was the big news of 2019, and this trend seems set to become a key factor of our market."" Buyers from Asian countries, such as China and Singapore, also are a growing force in the Irish property market, Mr. Craigie said. ""We expect this trend to continue to gain strength over the coming 12 months, bringing with it considerable buying power to the middle and upper ends of the residential market, with a special focus on Dublin,"" he said.","The country's robust post-recession recovery slowed in 2019, but locals are optimistic that it can recover again after the pandemic.",1b74d031-b3df-5b9f-a62a-919edc831b3a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/24/realestate/24IHH-IRELAND-slide-QBKV/24IHH-IRELAND-slide-QBKV-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=2e1a61337b0685cf8aa8268f0629d44f9085a9413d294ecd87db266130f5aac1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"To the rear of the house, a terrace with a barbecue pit is surrounded by Victorian-style gardens with seating areas among mature shrubs and trees.",1b74d031-b3df-5b9f-a62a-919edc831b3a,N24News/imgs/1b74d031-b3df-5b9f-a62a-919edc831b3a.jpg,7
Food,Star Sommelier Resigns After Accusations of Sexual Assault,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/dining/anthony-cailan-resigns-sex-assault.html,"The sommelier Anthony Cailan, who was a rising star in the wine world, has resigned from the downtown Manhattan hotel where he worked, after a New York Times report last week in which several women said he had sexually assaulted them.

Bogdan Docu, the general manager of the Nolitan hotel, on Kenmare Street, where Mr. Cailan was beverage director since June 2018, confirmed that the sommelier no longer worked there in an email on Thursday. Mr. Cailan is also no longer employed at the hotel's restaurant, the Usual, where his brother, Alvin, remains the chef.

Anthony Cailan, 29, is alleged to have sexually assaulted, or attempted to assault, at least four women, two of whom described the incidents in detail in The Times and were named in the article. Mr. Cailan responded last week: ""The truth is, these allegations against me are false. I look forward to the opportunity to clear my name."" He could not be reached for comment this week by email or phone.

Mr. Docu added that none of Mr. Cailan's accusers worked at the Usual and that its management was not aware of any allegations against Mr. Cailan by any past or present employees.

Global Business,"Greece Nears the Precipice, Raising Fear",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/business/global/as-greece-struggles-the-world-imagines-a-default.html,"Slower economic growth throughout Europe, and probably in the United States. Huge losses by major European banks. Declining stock markets worldwide. A tightening of credit, making it harder for many borrowers to get loans. As concerns grow that Greece may default on its government debt, economists are starting to map out possible outcomes. While no one knows for certain what will happen, it's a given that financial crises always have unexpected consequences, and many predict there will be collateral damage. Because of these fears, Greece is working frantically in concert with other European nations to avoid default, by embracing further austerity measures it has promised in return for more European bailout money to help pay its debts. But some economists believe default may be inevitable -- and that it may actually be better for Greece and, despite a short-term shock to the system, perhaps eventually for Europe as well. They are beginning to wonder whether the consequences of a default or a more radical debt restructuring, dire as they may be, would be no worse for Greece than the miserable path it is currently on.

A default would relieve Greece of paying off a mountain of debt that it cannot afford, no matter how much it continues to cut government spending, which already has caused its economy to shrink. At the same time, however, there is a fear of the unknown beyond Greece's borders. Merrill Lynch estimates that the shock to growth in Europe, while not as severe as in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008, would be troubling, with overall output contracting by 1.3 percent in 2012. While other countries have defaulted on their sovereign debt in recent times without causing systemic contagion, analysts weighing the numbers on Greece note that its debt is far higher, so the ripple effects could be more serious. Total Greek public debt is about 370 billion euros, or $500 billion. By comparison, Argentina's debt was $82 billion when it defaulted in 2001; when Russia defaulted, in 1998, its debt was $79 billion. Economists also warn that a Greek default could put further pressure on Italy, the euro zone's third-largest economy, which, though solvent, is struggling to enact austerity measures and find a way to stimulate growth. Moreover, Italy's government debt is five times the size of Greece's, and concerns about Italy's ability to meet its obligations could grow if Greece defaults.

In a new sign of trouble for the country, Standard & Poor's on Monday cut Italy's credit rating by one notch to A, citing its weakening economy and limited political response. ""Orderly or not, we have no idea what the effect of a default would be on other countries, especially Italy,"" said Peter Bofinger, an economist who advises the German Finance Ministry. ""If there is just a 5 percent chance that this affects Italy, then you don't want to do it."" In part, what would happen in the wake of a Greek default would depend on whether European leaders could create a firewall to control the damage from spreading widely. That would require officials to come together in ways they so far have not been able to, because it is politically unpopular in some countries to spend many billions more bailing out Greece. In particular, work on transforming Europe's main financial rescue vehicle, the 440 billion euro European Financial Stability Facility, would have to be fast tracked so that it would be in a position to buy European bonds and, crucially, provide emergency loans to countries that need to inject money into capital starved banks. Differences over the best way to go forward so far have delayed approval of the expanded fund. Bailing out the banks will be crucial if Greece either defaults or imposes a hard restructuring, whereby banks would be forced to take a larger loss on their holdings compared with the fairly benign 21 percent losses that they are now being asked to accept as part of the second, 109 billion euro bailout package set for Greece in June.

""We believe losses could be substantially larger through deleveraging and second-round effects, contagion from failure of individual banks from or outside the periphery, exposures of the nonbank financial sector,"" the Merrill Lynch report concluded. While a 60 to 70 percent debt write-down seems extreme, it actually represents the market expectation, with most Greek debt now trading below 40 cents on the dollar. A Greek default also would be costly to the European Central Bank, the Continent's equivalent of the Federal Reserve. To help prop up Greece, the central bank is believed to have bought about 40 billion euros in Greek bonds at much higher prices than where they now trade. If the central bank were forced to take a major loss on its Greek bonds, it too would need a capital infusion. And the burden would most likely fall on Germany. Analysts also say the seriousness of the crisis will depend on whether Greece stays within the euro common-currency zone or is forced to leave it, and return to the drachma as its national currency. Willem Buiter, the chief economist at Citigroup, presents two possible default outcomes. In the first, Greece forces private sector creditors to take a loss on their bonds of 60 to 80 percent but manages to stay inside the euro zone by keeping current on the smaller amount that it owes its official lenders, like the European Union and the I.M.F. While technically a default, the loss would not be an outright repudiation of Greece's debt and the contagion could, in theory, be contained. One big unknown revolves around the fact that, unlike other countries that have defaulted on their debts in the past, Greece does not have its own currency.

The potentially more dangerous default outcome is if Greece decides to leave or is forced to leave the euro, according to Mr. Buiter. Then, Mr. Buiter believes, the debt write-off would approach 100 percent and the effects on international markets could be much more serious. Offsetting this, to some extent, is the fact that exiting the euro zone and re-adopting the drachma would enable Greece to devalue its currency versus the rest of Europe, and help it become more competitive, perhaps spurring economic growth. For the moment, Greek officials are adamant that neither a default nor a euro exit and devaluation is in the cards. One senior policy maker in Greece's Finance Ministry, who declined to be identified because of the delicacy of the matter, even offered to send his questioner a case of 2005 Dom Perignon Champagne if Greece ever repudiated its debt. But close followers of Greece's budget dynamics point to the fact that, despite the country's deficit woes, by next year Greece is likely to have achieved a primary budget surplus, meaning that after taking out the high levels of interest it pays on its debt, it will be running a surplus. History shows that a country tends only to take such a drastic step as cutting ties with its international lenders when it has tightened its belt enough to achieve a budget surplus, and it is only payments to its bankers that is keeping it in the red. Such was the case in most of the recent country defaults, including Argentina, Ecuador, Indonesia and Jamaica, economists at the I.M.F. found in a paper published last year that addressed when a country finds its interest is served by default. ""My view is that it is very much in Greece's interest to default now, as there is no prospect that it can repay its debt,"" said Desmond Lachman, a former I.M.F. economist at the American Enterprise Institute. ""If it is inevitable that an insolvent Greece is going to have to restructure, it would be better for Greece to do it now.""",Economists are beginning to wonder whether a default or a more radical debt restructuring might be no worse for Greece than the miserable path it is currently on.,8dd6c6f4-d500-5c2c-af91-f6e63ca1bba9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/09/20/business/Euro1/Euro1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=330&w=600&s=ef0be22d395f5f00951a474308c3b8b38ba94a9e33f9a60e094227b31db81b6f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Evangelos Venizelos, Greece's finance minister, on Monday at a conference in Vouliagmeni.",8dd6c6f4-d500-5c2c-af91-f6e63ca1bba9,N24News/imgs/8dd6c6f4-d500-5c2c-af91-f6e63ca1bba9.jpg,24
Opinion,Following Dorothea Lange's Notebooks,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/opinion/dorothea-lange-photos.html,"HOLTVILLE, Calif. -- It's late when I check into the Barbara Worth Country Club, 600 miles southeast of my home in the Bay Area. Spare rooms border dark fields, a dry golf course and a web of open irrigation troughs that help make Imperial County one of the biggest agricultural producers in California. Holtville calls itself the carrot capital of the world, and even now, after this season's harvest, stray carrot tops bolt, blooming to seed. Fifteen miles from my hotel is the border with Mexico, a boundary now marked by barbed wire that loops around the edges of the All-American Canal, an elaborate, 80-mile long aqueduct that diverts water from Colorado to irrigate farmland that would otherwise get around three inches of rain per year.

Ms. Lange came to Imperial County during the late 1930s, capturing a different generation of migrants drawn here from Mexico, the Philippines, Oklahoma and the Dakotas, looking for work in the carrot fields. In 1937, she photographed ramshackle tents lining a canal; a group of Model T's making haphazard camp in a gully. In other shots, cabbage pickers bend deep and hoist baskets high on their shoulders. Ms. Lange, best known for her Depression-era photographs of migrant laborers, began photographing bread lines and labor strikes near her San Francisco studio in 1932. In the 1920s, she had made her living as a society portraitist, photographing San Francisco's wealthiest families -- the Levi Strauss and the Haas families among them. As the Great Depression worsened, she began photographing people she saw on the streets: men curled up sleeping or in line for food. In 1935, she married the economist Paul Taylor; they left San Francisco together to photograph the living conditions of agricultural laborers up and down the state, from Davis and Marysville all the way to Imperial County. The Farm Security Administration supported their work.

""Not enough money for cotton sacks"" reads another note; ""All I've got is right here."" ""Sold everything little by little."" ""We said we came from,"" she writes in a note that ends in an eerie, indecipherable smudge: ""They said, ""Why don't you go back there then?"" As a poet, I was drawn to the chorus of voices Ms. Lange recorded, which call across time. Her notebooks catalog concerns that feel sharply relevant eight decades later: the search for shelter, a fair wage and stable work. Last year, from January to October, I drove across California, following routes Ms. Lange noted in her travels from 1935 to 1942, by which time she had been hired by the Office of War Information to document the process of Japanese internment.

But the Bay Area today is no picture of middle class stability. My once modest neighborhood has skyrocketing home prices -- a small three-bedroom that eight years ago cost $500,000 now lists for $1.3 million, while roughly 28,000 homeless people sleep on the streets in the Bay Area each night. Vacant lots, industrial blocks and underpasses nearby fill with semipermanent encampments. I bike my children to school each day through a maze of tents and trailers. Following Ms. Lange's images and notes has become a study in uneasy juxtapositions: rifts between enormous wealth and unsettled poverty, some of which feel new, some like a continuation of the past.

In Imperial County, which now has the highest unemployment rate in California, Eddie Preciado of Catholic Charities holds beds at the county's one homeless shelter for men, offering shelter to migrant laborers who cross the border to pick corn. ""There's still no dedicated housing for agricultural workers,"" he told me. Down the road, a detention center run by Management Training Corporation for ICE holds 782 beds. ""Most middle-class jobs are in border security,"" Mr. Preciado said. In Nipomo, where Ms. Lange pulled over near a frozen pea field to make her famous photograph ""Migrant Mother"" in 1936, a new community of $1.2 million tract homes overlooks rows of factory-farmed strawberry fields edged with workers' trailers.",The Californian photographer known for her images of the Great Depression is a guide to the complexity of the present.,65001b93-ab99-56a1-8233-6f7c12f87249,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/29/opinion/29Taylor1/29Taylor1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=3cf57322a11073f63a7ac6fd1ca4d3693fbaee3bb5223b0f3663bed74a26b1d4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Dorothea Lange.,65001b93-ab99-56a1-8233-6f7c12f87249,N24News/imgs/65001b93-ab99-56a1-8233-6f7c12f87249.jpg,11

A Half Hour, And I Want Something Different When to watch: Now, on Hulu Six seasons of this Canadian comedy are currently available to stream, and you might wind up blazing through all of them before Season 7 comes out in October -- it's that fun and surprising. Set in a rural town, ""Letterkenny"" has unique rhythms and stylized dialogue that's sometimes outrageously dirty but more often just hilarious in its specificity (especially lines from Daryl, played by Nathan Dales). Lots of today's best comedies seem alike in attitude or style, but ""Letterkenny"" is flying a solo mission; the jokes are twice as funny because they're so distinctive. ...

Eli Cohen worked under an assumed identity in Syria in the 1960s, eventually infiltrating powerful political and military circles.

Technology,The Week in Tech: How Much Regulation Is Too Much?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/technology/tech-regulation-antitrust.html,"The Week in Tech: How Much Regulation Is Too Much?

Hi. I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at the week's tech news. You say antitrust. I say: How much? There is little as fashionable in 2019 as the desire to curb Big Tech's power. But knowing how far regulators should go in putting limits on Silicon Valley's largest companies isn't straightforward. At one extreme, there are calls to break up Big Tech. Senator Elizabeth Warren grabbed headlines during the week when she called for just that. Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, argued that companies shouldn't offer their own products on platforms they controlled (like Apple's selling apps on its App Store -- something Spotify called out to European regulators on Wednesday). She also said she would roll back anticompetitive acquisitions, such as Facebook's takeovers of Instagram and WhatsApp. Her pitch isn't perfect, as The New York Times's Kevin Roose pointed out -- it's too generic, misses easy wins and overlooks some big issues. But it is a bold, inspiring rally cry for Big Tech's biggest critics. At the other end of the spectrum: tech companies. Ideally, the likes of Facebook and Google would love to perpetually operate in the lightly regulated world that helped them grow so quickly. But even Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, acknowledged that it was ""inevitable that there will be some regulation"" when he testified to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in April.

There's plenty of room between those extremes. Take, for example, a report published Wednesday by the British government, which called for an overhaul of antitrust policies for Big Tech. Its main proposal: that a new regulator identify companies with ""strategic market status,"" then block some activities -- such as promoting their own products or services in search results over those belonging to competitors (hello, Google!). That, the report's authors say, is a ""more pro-business and pro-consumer solution"" than ""changing antitrust law to drive breakup"" of businesses. So who's right? Mr. Zuckerberg, at least when he says regulatory intervention is inevitable. There's strong bipartisan support for such regulation. As for where a line should be drawn, that's harder to say. Breaking up big companies isn't easy: It's expensive and takes a long time. And it doesn't always go to plan. The last notable attempt to do so, when a judge ruled two decades ago that Microsoft be cleaved for having violated antitrust law, was overturned on appeal. So Ms. Warren could have her work cut out for her. But it may ultimately become a question of balancing ambition with need. Is it better to gamble on breaking up big companies, or guarantee that new rules curb some of their behavior? That's something that lawmakers are going to have to wrestle with.

Trading off trust for profit to build A.I. When OpenAI was founded three years ago, it had a huge goal: to build artificial intelligence software that was as capable as the human brain. Its founders said that because it was a nonprofit with noble ambitions -- it had $1 billion in funding from backers to pay its way -- the public could trust it to build that so-called general artificial intelligence. Only, $1 billion doesn't go far with goals like that. Huge computing resources and big salaries to attract talent burn through cash. Actually, it turns out, some profits might be useful. So, Wired reported, Open AI announced that it was changing its business model. To keep up with Facebook and Google, it created a OpenAI L.P., a company that can take money from investors that need to return a profit, like venture funds. That will make it easier to raise funds. Down the line, it might monetize some of the technology it develops. But the company decided to cap the returns that investors will see -- to $100 for every dollar invested. One way to think of that figure is that OpenAI deems a 100-times return to be an ethical margin on building a general A.I. -- enough to make it a feasible endeavor, but not so much as to tar it with the Big Tech brush. That reasoning clearly holds if you inhabit Silicon Valley. But it will be interesting to see if that profit cap is enough to put everyone at ease. What the web could look like in 30 years On March 12, 1989, Tim Berners-Lee proposed an idea for linking digital files that his boss, Mike Sendall, called ""vague but exciting."" It ultimately became the World Wide Web, and 30 years later we're left with much to love -- and hate -- about its existence. At an event at London's Science Museum on Tuesday to mark the web's passage into its fourth decade, Mr. Berners-Lee was asked what it might look like in another 30 years. Here's what he said: # ""It's not, I think, for us to try and guess."" # ""Look at what's happened over the last 30 years. The web has changed really dramatically, and a lot of that we couldn't have predicted."" # ""What we can do is we can say what web we want."" # ""We want a web which is open. We want a web which is royalty-free. We want a web which is discrimination-free.""

Worthy goals. And in an article he wrote this past week, Mr. Berners-Lee laid out steps that may be required to ensure they happen: # ""Governments must translate laws and regulations for the digital age. They must ensure markets remain competitive, innovative and open."" # ""Companies must do more to ensure their pursuit of short-term profit is not at the expense of human rights, democracy, scientific fact or public safety."" # ""Platforms and products must be designed with privacy, diversity and security in mind. "" # ""And most important of all, citizens must hold companies and governments accountable."" Thirty years on, Mr. Sendall's analysis might apply equally well to this proposal, too. And some stories you shouldn't miss Elon Musk really dislikes whistle-blowers. According to Businessweek, Mr. Musk, the Tesla chief executive, set out to destroy one employee who leaked details about raw materials wastage at the company. How does Google pay off executives accused of misconduct? Handsomely: Two shared a total of $135 million, according to details that emerged from a lawsuit during the week. Who will fund the next wave of tech start-ups? That'll be the millionaires who are created when companies like Airbnb and Uber go public. You should care about TikTok. You might never use it, but it could reshape social media as you know it.",Knowing how far to go in curbing Big Tech's power might not be as straightforward as it first seems.,466d924a-7b5b-56a4-a871-0090094cdca7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/18/business/18technewsletter-print/15technewsletter-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=585982a4022357fd478ab219abbc7dcd9271fb25e3cc23166dabc1f69e987676&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A screen demonstrating facial recognition using artificial intelligence at the CES tech conference in Las Vegas this year.,466d924a-7b5b-56a4-a871-0090094cdca7,N24News/imgs/466d924a-7b5b-56a4-a871-0090094cdca7.jpg,20

Theater,"Broadway, Symbol of New York Resilience, Shuts Down Amid Virus Threat",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/theater/coronavirus-broadway-shutdown.html,"The adage is synonymous with Broadway itself: the show must go on. And for decades, through wars and recessions and all forms of darkness, Broadway, the heart of America's theater industry and an economic lifeblood for many artists, has kept its curtains up and its footlights on. But on Thursday, facing a widening coronavirus pandemic and new limitations on large gatherings, the industry said it was suspending all plays and musicals for 32 days, effective immediately. ""The idea that our venerable, majestic houses are dark, and that there will be no lights on Broadway -- I'm romanticizing, but that's the heartbeat of the city, and to think that they've been forced into darkness is shocking,"" said Patti LuPone, a beloved Broadway titan who has won two Tony Awards and has been performing in previews for a revival of ""Company."" ""I'm shocked that they took this tack, but also grateful they did, just to keep us healthy.""

The move came as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio enacted new restrictions to try to stop the spread of the virus, which in the city has infected nearly 100 people, a number expected to grow. City and state officials banned most gatherings of more than 500 people, and required smaller venues to cut their capacity by half; they also limited nursing home visits. Mr. de Blasio declared a state of emergency, empowering him to take measures like implementing a curfew or limiting traffic should conditions worsen. Public schools, however, were remaining open. The governor noted many children's resistance to the virus, while the mayor expressed worry about the disruptions that school closings would create.

Broadway -- central to, and symbolic of, New York -- is not only the pinnacle of the American theater world, but is also big business: Last season the industry grossed $1.8 billion and drew 14.8 million patrons. ""The full effects of this on the industry can't possibly be known yet, but our priority has to be the well-being of audiences and our Broadway families,"" said Thomas Schumacher, the president of Disney Theatrical Productions (""The Lion King,"" ""Aladdin"" and ""Frozen"") and the chairman of the Broadway League, the industry trade group.

The shuttering of theaters, which the Broadway League said would continue through April 12, followed a flood of cultural closings around the country and around the world. Earlier on Thursday, several of New York's largest and most prestigious cultural institutions -- including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Opera, Carnegie Hall and the New York Philharmonic -- announced that they would temporarily shut down. At the same time, Live Nation Entertainment and AEG Presents, the corporate giants that dominate the concert industry, suspended all North American tour engagements. In Asia and Europe, many performance spaces had already closed; in the United States, venues from the 5th Avenue Theater in Seattle to the Center Theater Group in Los Angeles to the Kennedy Center in Washington scrapped shows. The theater industry had been hoping to avoid mass closings, taking steps to reduce the risk of infection by adding hand sanitizer dispensers, more frequently cleaning seats, barring backstage visits and stage door interactions and even soda refills in used cups.

But Broadway has a lot of risk factors -- many of its shows attract an older audience, and older people seem to be particularly susceptible to the coronavirus; it depends heavily on tourism, which is plunging as a result of the pandemic; and its theaters, lovely as they are, pack patrons into tight quarters, making the now-recommended social distancing essentially impossible. As public health officials increasingly warned about the riskiness of large gatherings, and after a part-time usher was diagnosed with the virus, the drumbeat for closing grew louder. Actors' Equity Association, a labor union representing 51,000 performers and stage managers around the country, was becoming more and more concerned. ""There's no such thing as social distancing for actors -- our jobs sometimes require that we go to work and kiss our colleagues eight times a week,"" said the actress Kate Shindle, who is the president of Equity. ""Although nobody wanted to close the theaters, at the same time people were starting to be scared to work, and with good reason."" And theater producers, facing dwindling advance sales and concern for audiences and employees, came to agree. ""Over the last 48 hours, watching everything escalate and the ground keep shifting, the Broadway League has done the responsible thing,"" said Sue Frost, a lead producer of the musical ""Come From Away,"" which had been set to celebrate its third anniversary Thursday night. ""We've got to protect our employees and our audiences, and if this is what we have to do, this is what we have to do."" The industry wanted either Mr. Cuomo or Mr. de Blasio to order a closing, because of a widespread understanding that the shows' insurance policies would provide coverage only if a closing were government-mandated.

And on Thursday afternoon, Mr. Cuomo obliged, ordering an end to all gatherings of more than 500 people. That encompassed all 41 Broadway theaters -- by definition, Broadway theaters must have more than 500 seats, and most have more than 1,000. Mr. Cuomo said the Broadway restriction would go into effect at 5 p.m. on Thursday, forcing a temporary end to the runs of all 31 plays and musicals currently in progress, from crowd favorites like ""Hamilton"" and ""The Lion King"" to new musicals like ""Six,"" which had been scheduled to open Thursday night. Signs went up at many theaters with information about refunds (often automatic for those who bought with credit cards from official theater sites) and exchanges. Mr. de Blasio, speaking at his own briefing, said the restriction was necessary but difficult. ""That's really, really painful for the many, many people who work in that field, let alone so many New Yorkers and people all over the country who really look forward to these events, these concerts, these sports events, and it's really going to be kind of a hole in our lives and it's painful,"" he said. ""It's not something we would ever want to do but it's something we have to do.""

The suspension comes at a difficult time for Broadway, which had 16 openings scheduled between Thursday (""Six"") and April 23 (""Take Me Out""). The latter date is currently the deadline for shows to open to be eligible for the June 7 Tony Awards. With the suspension of performances, industry officials acknowledge that the deadline and the date of the awards ceremony might have to change. Given the length of the shutdown, some shows might opt to cut their losses and never open; industry officials said they also expected that some running shows -- those already experiencing box office weakness -- would close rather than try to weather a shutdown and reopen. The cancellations will invariably be disappointing for tourists and locals who rely on Broadway for inspiration, entertainment, and artistry. On Thursday afternoon, two visitors from Brazil, Mariana Marinho and Barbara Anderaos, popped into the Broadhurst Theater to ask about tickets for ""Jagged Little Pill,"" the musical built around Alanis Morissette's songs. Ms. Marinho, 36, had loved Ms. Morissette's music since she was a teenager, and the friends had over a week left to explore New York culture. As they inquired about seating and ticket prices, a box office employee broke the news to them: No Broadway shows until April 12. ""I have never seen a Broadway show, so I thought maybe this was my chance,"" Ms. Marinho said. ""I guess not.""","Facing restrictions on audience size and concern from actors and audiences about health risks during the coronavirus pandemic, the industry announced that shows will be shuttered through April 12.",f574aa86-7b3d-508f-8601-e01b639cb833,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/12/arts/12virus-broadway-7/12virus-broadway-7-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=935040a98e1328bcdb96e0a5a740bd70769ae53e49a9423ea8376a5c3cac9899&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Majestic Theater, where ""The Phantom of the Opera"" has been playing since 1988.

Television,"With 'NOS4A2,' Joe Hill Finally Sinks His Teeth Into TV",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/arts/television/nos4a2-joe-hill-amc.html,"""It's kind of a gold rush, right?"" Joe Hill said. In addition to the AMC show, his comic-book title ""Locke & Key"" and two short stories are being picked up for the screen.





On a sunny spring morning in a hotel near Central Park, the writer Joe Hill settled into an overstuffed chair before an 18th-century-style fireplace, received tea and sandwiches -- rectangular, crusts removed -- and stroked his graying beard. He was there to talk about a vile old man with rotten teeth who feasts on the souls of young children. The contrast was one he seemed to relish, with self-awareness. ""The tea I'm drinking is called Mystical Creatures , which is a little bit on the nose for today's themes,"" he said. ""But we'll roll with it."" Those themes, in no particular order, included: vampirism; feminism; supernaturalism; sadism; his father, the best-selling novelist Stephen King; and his own best-selling novel ""NOS4A2,"" which has been developed into a TV series that debuts Sunday on AMC. An update to the classic vampire tale (the title is a play on ""Nosferatu""), the series follows a supernaturally gifted young heroine from a broken New England home and her battles against the villain Charlie Manx, who carries children off in a demonic Rolls-Royce to a terrifying place called Christmasland. ""NOS4A2,"" Hill's third novel, was an obvious fit for television. ""NOS4A2"" is both the first of Hill's stories to make it to the small screen and one of several TV projects he now has in the works, a dramatic reversal of fortune after multiple stalled attempts. Misfires included a reboot of George A. Romero's horror series ""Tales From the Darkside,"" which never made it past the pilot stage after Hill wrote several scripts, and two adaptations of ""Locke & Key,"" a comic Hill did with the artist Gabriel Rodriguez. Separate pilots were produced for each -- first for Fox, then for Hulu -- but both were dropped.

Then suddenly, abundance: In addition to ""NOS4A2 ,"" ""Locke & Key"" was finally picked up for a Netflix series, which is expected to debut by early next year. A Netflix film based on ""In the Tall Grass,"" a short story Hill wrote with his father, is expected this fall. And in a development that completes a personal circle for Hill, the streaming service Shudder is in postproduction on an adaptation of his 2014 short story ""By the Silver Water of Lake Champlain"" for its anthology series ""Creepshow,"" a reboot of the 1982 movie written by King -- which also starred Hill as a little boy. ""I feel like I've had a real lucky run,"" he said. ""But it's kind of a gold rush, right?"" Networks and streaming services were now ""vacuuming up books and comic books and short stories,"" he argued, which presented new opportunities for writers who worked with ""suspense and high concepts."" ""We'll see how long it lasts,"" he added. ""Probably until the environmental apocalypse finishes us all off.""

""NOS4A2"" traveled a comparatively straightforward path to TV. Published in 2013, the novel was an immediate best seller; by 2015, it had found its way to AMC, which has made horror a core part of its programming. ""The Walking Dead"" remains one of TV's most popular shows, and a spinoff, ""Fear the Walking Dead,"" begins its fifth season Sunday as the lead-in for ""NOS4A2."" This summer AMC will present a second season of its well-received anthology series ""The Terror,"" which brings supernatural horror to historical settings. Screen adaptations of sprawling stories are, of course, a tradition in Hill's family. Dozens of his father's stories have been adapted, many into classics, like ""Carrie,"" ""The Dead Zone"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption."" Others, like ""Maximum Overdrive"" and ""The Lawnmower Man"" ... weren't so classic. (AMC is also developing a pilot script based on ""Sleeping Beauties,"" a novel written by Stephen and Owen King, Hill's brother.) Hill said his father had offered some good advice about the vicissitudes of having one's work adapted, a process over which the writer often has little control once the rights are sold. ""He'd say, ' If someone takes one of my novels and makes a brilliant movie, it doesn't make my novel one word better ,'"" Hill said. The important thing, King told him, was to ""be working on the next book."" As valuable as it was to have the world's most famous living horror writer for a father, Hill was determined to succeed on his own merits. ""I knew by the time I was 12 that I really wanted to make stuff up for a living,"" he said. Still, he ""was deeply insecure"" about being taken seriously.

""I needed to feel like when I got published, I got published for the right reasons,"" he said. Hence the pseudonym, which Hill adopted in college -- a shortening of his full name, Joseph Hillstrom King. After early attempts to separate himself even further -- writing what he called ""New Yorker-type stories about divorce and difficult children and middle-age ennui"" -- he soon realized that the stories ""had no inner life."" Once he embraced the uncanny storytelling he had always loved, success soon followed, including several best-selling novels. (His identity was officially outed by Variety in 2006. ) ""NOS4A2,"" Hill's third novel, was an obvious fit for television, said David Madden, the president of programing for AMC's entertainment networks. Madden believed that recent years had seen a deepening interest in what he called ""immersive horror,"" with its longer arcs and detailed character building. ""I don't think you could have compressed it into an hour and 45 minutes and done it any version of justice,"" Madden said. (Hill's second novel, ""Horns,"" was made into a movie , released in 2014 to middling reviews.)

Compressing the story also let O'Brien confine Vic's portrayal to a single actress. Ashleigh Cummings (""Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries""), who plays Vic, said she had been drawn to the character in part because she relied on powers other than the traditionally masculine ones valued in most superheroines. It was important, she said, to ""broaden the scope of the term 'strength' to include qualities that have been typically attributed as female."" ""She does have the courage and bravery that you see in superheroine females, but her strongest muscle is actually her heart,"" Cummings said. ""And her superpowers are her creativity, her intuition, her empathy, her vulnerability."" It seemed important to Hill that his brand of horror should convey that depth of character, beyond the blood and guts. (Though the story has plenty of that, too.) Television was great for that, he noted, because a viewer could really fall in love with the characters over many weeks and months, and thus come to root for them. ""I think some people think horror is about sadism; it's about flinging intestines at the camera,"" he said. ""And some is. And I like some of that stuff. But I do think the really effective horror is about empathy.""","The AMC horror series is one of several adaptations the best-selling horror author (and son of Stephen King) has in the works, after multiple stalled attempts.",83159e41-d04a-516e-b071-866069b913bf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/01/arts/31joehill1/31joehill1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=4a83929116f5c1d0fe5223c07b6da0ab056437e9f2c30f1ff8dff7ee205d11fa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of a gold rush, right?&rdquo; Joe Hill said.

Movies,'The Irishman': What to Read About Martin Scorsese's Netflix Mob Drama,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/movies/the-irishman-release.html,"""The Irishman,"" the director Martin Scorsese's latest crime epic (truly, at three and a half hours), premieres Friday in movie theaters around the country before reaching Netflix on Nov. 27. The film, about a hitman (Robert De Niro), a Mafia boss (Joe Pesci) and the never-solved death of the Teamsters leader Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino), has been rapturously reviewed and is already a leading contender for this year's biggest Oscar categories. Here are a few reviews, interviews and features to check out if you're planning to watch it this weekend.

""The Irishman"" Review: The Mob's Greatest Hits, in a Somber Key [The New York Times]

A.O. Scott, The Times's co-chief movie critic, reviewed the film when it premiered at the New York Film Festival in late September. And while this is a mob movie through and through, it feels very different. ""Don't get me wrong: there is plenty of grisly, crazy mob lore, blood and tomato sauce, guys with colorful nicknames, episodes that wander away from the main plot,"" Scott writes. ""The business of graft, extortion and influence peddling occupies all these men, but ""The Irishman"" finds its emotional center in the vicissitudes of their friendship. This is Scorsese's least sentimental picture of mob life, and for that reason his most poignant.""","The movie is opening in theaters Friday before moving to Netflix.

Dance,Richard Alston Dance Company to Shutter in 2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/08/arts/dance/richard-alston-dance.html,"LONDON -- The Richard Alston Dance Company, which has played an important role in British dance, will close in spring 2020, the company announced on Monday. Since the company's inception in 1994, it has been resident at The Place, a contemporary dance center and performance space in north London where Mr. Alston, 70, has been the artistic director, also since 1994. In April, The Place announced that he would step down from that role to focus on his company. No replacement for this position has been announced.

In a telephone interview, Mr. Alston said that he had ""absolutely chosen"" to step down as the artistic director of The Place, but that closing the company has been a more complicated decision. He said his troupe has received most of its funding through an Arts Council England grant given to The Place, which last year applied to be a National Portfolio organization -- a company or institution that is regularly funded over a four-year period. ""That essentially requires you to reinvent yourself, and The Place decided to focus on younger artists and tour them,"" he said. That meant his company would no longer be in residence at The Place and would lose most of its funding.

Mr. Alston said he agreed to this strategy because he couldn't see any other option. ""But I can't pretend I'm ecstatic about it,"" he said. ""I feel the Arts Council have robbed Peter to pay Paul, and I'm not very happy to be Peter."" He added that he had received his first Arts Council grant in 1972, and was grateful for the council's continuing support. ""They have changed their priorities, and I have to accept that,"" he said.

Mr. Alston, who studied for two years at the Merce Cunningham Dance Studio in the 1970s, draws from both contemporary dance and ballet in his work, and has long been considered a senior statesman in the dance world. In 2017, Alastair Macaulay wrote in The New York Times that he has been ""Europe's finest dancemaker since the death of Frederick Ashton in 1988.""","The troupe, which has played an important role in British dance, is losing its access to funding.",4b073c4c-feaa-5335-94a8-c259c3c95276,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/13/arts/13arts2/09alston-item-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=a01cc35aa038cfb2d6bb34133e2333303bb2f79eb792fa6fa49cf3bcde958430&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Richard Alston in a 2008 photo.,4b073c4c-feaa-5335-94a8-c259c3c95276,N24News/imgs/4b073c4c-feaa-5335-94a8-c259c3c95276.jpg,6
Health,"Nurses Are at High Risk for Covid Among Health Workers, C.D.C. Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/26/health/covid-nurses-.html,"Among health care workers, nurses in particular have been at significant risk of contracting Covid-19, according to a new analysis of hospitalized patients by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The findings were released Monday as a surge of new hospitalizations swept the country, with several states hitting record levels of cases.

About 6 percent of adults hospitalized from March through May were health care workers, according to the researchers, with more than a third either nurses or nursing assistants. Roughly a quarter, or 27 percent, of those hospitalized workers were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 4 percent died during their hospital stay.

Technology,"Hey, Mike Tyson. I Can Beat You Blindfolded.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/18/technology/personaltech/blindfolded-speed-runners-video-games.html,"Jacob Criminski playing Pokemon Blue while blindfolded. He said he used the sounds of hitting walls to orient himself, and timed direction changes to certain beats of the game's soundtrack in specific locations.

As his summer break from the University of Connecticut drew to a close last August, Alex Tan had one more goal before school began: to reclaim a world record in video gaming. To prepare, Mr. Tan sat at the computer at his family home in Rocky Hill, Conn. Next, he booted up Super Mario World, the 1990 classic video game from Nintendo, in which the beloved mascot Mario jumps, swims and flies through eight colorful worlds to rescue Princess Toadstool. Then Mr. Tan, 20, who plays under the handle PangaeaPanga, covered his eyes with a thick black eye mask. His aim: To finish the game as fast as possible while blindfolded. In 2015, Mr. Tan became the first person to complete Super Mario World while blindfolded, in 23 minutes 14 seconds, a feat certified by fellow gamers who watched him live-stream the run. The record stood for a little over a year until a Japanese player who goes by the handle Dodaimurige beat that time last July by more than five minutes. When Mr. Tan learned his record had fallen, he said he knew he could do better. ""That was my motivation to come back and do it again,"" he said, adding that he began playing blindfolded simply ""because nobody's done it yet.""

Mr. Tan is one of many gamers who have in the last few years popularized the playing of video games with covered eyes, a trend known as blindfolded speed-running. The pastime has caught on on YouTube and among some streamers on Twitch, the online streaming video game service owned by Amazon. Many players stream their blindfolded play-throughs or post the experiences on YouTube to build up interest in the trend and to establish community-verified records, absent any official sanctioning body. Blindfolded speed-runners have rushed through classic 2-D games, including Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!. These older games tend to have smaller levels and significantly shorter playtimes than newer 3-D games, making it possible to play through them in minutes rather than hours (though at least one blindfolded gamer has posted a 100-plus-hour play-through of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, a 3-D game that took him more than a year to complete). Using blindfolds has been a long-held practice in other pursuits. Chess players value playing blindfolded as a way of distilling the game's principles, for example. Jujitsu players have praised training with blindfolds to heighten focus on one's movements and positioning. You can even run five-kilometer or 10K races while blindfolded (with the help of a companion jogger to keep you out of trouble). But gaming without sight may be even more counterintuitive since games depend on a near-constant tether of visual feedback to guide players. One of the first recorded attempts came in 2011 when a speed-runner tried to play through the original Super Mario Bros. while blindfolded at a gaming charity marathon -- but failed. In 2014 and 2015, Mr. Tan and others began to break through, completing full runs and establishing records for others to challenge. So how does playing video games work without visual cues? The speed-runners say they rely on a game's sound effects and music to know where they are in the process. Jacob Criminiski, 23, who has completed multiple blindfolded speed-runs of the Game Boy game Pokemon Blue, with the fastest time of 19:50, said he used the sounds of hitting walls to orient himself, and timed direction changes to certain beats of the game's soundtrack in specific locations.

""It's really just about finding those little things that make it easier,"" said Mr. Criminski, a student at the University of Dayton in Ohio. ""As soon as you hit a wall, there's a little bonking sound. You find 20 things that make it easier, and you add them all together and it turns into something that's pretty easily done."" Once the patterns and timing are committed to muscle memory, it can be recalled anywhere, with or without sight. ""It's something that never goes away once you can do it, which is what's cool about it,"" he said.

Jack Wedge, 30, said he began blindfolded speed-running in 2015 while stuck at home during a snowstorm on Prince Edward Island, Canada, where he works for a local delivery service. He had seen an attempt at a blindfolded run of one of his favorite games, Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, at a charity stream extravaganza in 2014. That player had made it to the game's final fight against Mike Tyson before losing by a TKO. With several days off because of the inclement weather, Mr. Wedge decided to try finishing the job. ""I had to learn to anticipate when things were coming, and I could tell I'd gotten something wrong when I heard the sound of me getting hit,"" Mr. Wedge said. After a week of practice, he finished the game blindfolded in just over 25 minutes. The accomplishment made Mr. Wedge a minor celebrity when several gaming websites picked up the video of his play-through, which he had posted on YouTube. ""A lot of people around town heard about the video going viral before I did,"" he said. ""A couple people even stopped hanging out with me over it, because they thought the whole thing was too nerdy.""

Anil Chirayath, community program manager of speed-running for Twitch, said the increase in blindfolded speed-running has been driven, in part, by the connection it builds between player and audience. ""Because of that shared journey, when speed-runners reach a goal and viewers witness and share in that success, it is an unforgettable experience for all involved,"" he wrote in an email. Mr. Tan, the Super Mario World player, said he started to play blindfolded in early 2015 after seeing a Twitch streamer with covered eyes play through the first level of the game. Mr. Tan wondered if he could finish the whole game -- after all, he had already played Super Mario World so many times that he could see almost every level in his head. It turned out he could. After setting the record for speed-running blindfolded through the game in 2015, Mr. Tan's video was covered on the websites of USA Today, Sports Illustrated and others. Mr. Tan began doing daily drills to improve once he was beaten by the Japanese player Dodaimurige, who did not respond to a message for comment. Last August, at his parents' home, Mr. Tan streamed his blindfolded practice runs for two days. At the end of the second day, he heard the sounds of the villain Bowser being defeated at the conclusion of the game. His new time: 15:59, a record now enshrined by the speed-running community and Guinness World Records. ""For most of the games, there's no celebratory thing for world records, so it doesn't feel as special,"" he said. ""But it still feels really good to the person because the rest of the community knows they worked really hard to get that world record.""","Speed-runners are rushing through classic video games, like Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!, without the benefit of sight, and to the delight of others.",9d9dcad5-882b-5400-a16f-825287cf219e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/18/business/19VIDGAME1/19VIDGAME1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=5fe9503c734458779f988c304fa55f6255a6b2c966dce0504ada74b26555d8fc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jacob Criminski playing Pokémon Blue while blindfolded.

Music,"A Year Later, the Fight Over Aretha Franklin's Estate Deepens",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/arts/music/aretha-franklin-estate-wills-fight.html,"At Aretha Franklin's funeral in Detroit a year ago, members of her family, dressed in crisp black and white, filled an aisle in the Greater Grace Temple as they walked together toward her coffin -- a solemn image of unity after the death of their matriarch. But that harmony seems all but lost now, as some of Franklin's closest kin -- including her four sons -- jockey for control of her estate and trade barbs in court over matters as serious as each other's competence and as minor as who gets to drive Franklin's Mercedes-Benz. Hanging in the balance is the value of an estate that some experts estimate could ultimately be worth hundreds of millions of dollars -- if the family can manage it properly. ""In the business of estate management, everybody in a family has to be on board and move together in a supportive, cooperative manner,"" said Jeff Jampol, who manages the estates of Janis Joplin, Otis Redding and the Doors, ""or they will tear the fabric of the legacy asunder.""

Family squabbles over celebrity estates are not rare, as infighting over the estates of Prince, James Brown and, more recently, Tom Petty, have made clear. But Franklin's case is especially complex because determining how she wanted her assets distributed involves deciphering whether any of the three hand-scrawled documents found in her home three months ago -- one of them under the couch cushions -- should be embraced as her will. When Franklin died, at age 76, her family believed she had no will. Under Michigan law, that meant her estate would be divided equally among her sons. With that understanding, the sons approved the appointment of a cousin, Sabrina Owens, as the estate's personal representative, or executor. But if any will is accepted by the probate judge overseeing the estate, that formula for the distribution of assets would be upended, with far-reaching consequences for Franklin's sons, whose earnings could change -- some drastically, depending on which will is declared legitimate. Ms. Owens's status as executor would also be in jeopardy. ""The wills changed everything,"" Charlene Glover-Hogan, a lawyer for Kecalf Franklin, the singer's youngest son, said at a contentious court hearing on Aug. 6.

Another son, Ted White Jr., was largely raised by the family of his father, Ted White, Franklin's former manager, to whom she was married in the 1960s, Ms. Owens said in an interview. All four sons, now middle-aged adults, have tried to pursue music careers. Kecalf performed as a Christian rapper under the name Kecalf Cunningham, to sometimes harsh reviews. Ted White Jr. played guitar for his mother under the name Teddy Richards. Edward Franklin tried to establish himself as a gospel singer. Clarence, who was born when Ms. Franklin was in her early teens, has written a number of songs, including some recorded by his mother. His current condition is unclear. In Ms. Franklin's March 2014 will, the last of three she drafted, she instructed her other sons to check on Clarence's welfare weekly and ""oversee his needs."" But Mildred Gaddis, a radio fixture in Detroit who was a friend of Franklin's, called Clarence ""quite aware, without question,"" and added: ""There's this perception out there that he is intellectually deficient. None of that is true."" Clarence's court-appointed guardian, Jon B. Munger, declined to comment on his client's health, but he has argued that neither the 2014 will, nor two earlier drafts dated in 2010, can be authenticated, and that they contain contradictory instructions and are at points illegible. If Franklin is found to have died without a will, Clarence would receive a one-fourth share, like the other sons. But the 2014 will does not even list him as a beneficiary, except to the extent that the other sons follow their mother's written dictate to take care of him. Kecalf, who favors the 2014 will, has been the most aggressive in court filings. His lawyers complained this week in court papers that, though the estate has cataloged some assets, it has taken too long to present a complete inventory.

Ms. Owens, the daughter of Aretha's sister Erma, denied any wrongdoing. In court papers, her lawyers said that Owens had transferred the title of the car to have it insured, not to own or use it, and in a pointed note, added that Kecalf had asked permission for his son to drive the vehicle. David J. Bennett, the primary lawyer for the estate, has pulled no punches in attacking Kecalf's petition, telling the judge, Jennifer S. Callaghan, that Kecalf lacks ""the capability to be a personal representative."" Mr. Bennett has also noted that the estate has advanced Kecalf money to pay his criminal attorney for a drunk-driving arrest last year. Edward Franklin largely sides with Kecalf about the wills, according to his lawyer, Craig A. Smith. Ted White Jr. has asked the judge to consider all three of the wills as representing Franklin's full wishes, and asked to be named personal representative alongside Ms. Owens.

Judge Callaghan has urged the family to settle its differences through a mediator. Under Michigan law, the family could bypass questions of the validity of the wills if all heirs can come to an agreement. But lawyers connected to the estate said that they did not expect such discussions to begin for months. Ms. Owens expressed frustration with the delays. ""When you have to deal with court and court petitions,"" she said, ""it all takes away from the more positive work that can be done."" Despite their legal tussles, the broader family is striving to hold together, said Cristal Franklin, another cousin. The Franklin brothers, she said, are on a private email list the family uses to vet the parades, tributes and other Aretha-related events that frequently come up -- yet all those events, and the constant media attention, she said, have not given the family ""a chance to grieve as normal people."" ""When it comes down to it,"" Cristal added, ""as a family we're still sticking with each other, we're still loving on each other. This has not been easy."" In court, though, the sons remain apart. Two of them, Edward and Kecalf, attended a recent hearing, where the judge considered whether to allow a distribution of some personal items as keepsakes to the sons but also to people like Barack Obama, who Mr. Bennett said has asked for the elaborate silver bow hat that Franklin wore to his first inauguration.

Edward and Kecalf sat separately throughout the proceeding. They did not speak to one another. Though the Franklin estate would appear poised to take in considerable future earnings, in the short term it faces mounting financial challenges. Among them are a claim from the Internal Revenue Service for up to $8 million in unpaid taxes and penalties (the estate says it has paid $3 million of that already); a $160,000 civil suit over royalties for Franklin's 1973 song ""Angel""; and -- filed just this month by Franklin's sister-in-law Earline -- a $43,000 claim for caregiving during Franklin's final months and for the return of an ""Air Force military flag.""

Real Estate,Frederick Douglass Boulevard: Newly Revived,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/05/realestate/frederick-douglass-boulevard-newly-revived.html,"Morningside Park, with the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in the background, is one of the parks near this revitalized corridor of Harlem.

New York has had its share of neighborhood turnarounds in the last 20 years, but few have been as rapid and transformative as that of Frederick Douglass Boulevard, a formerly blighted corridor of often-abandoned tenements interspersed with rubble-filled lots and tire-repair shops. Sometimes called Eighth Avenue, Frederick Douglass originates at 110th Street, the longtime psychic barrier between the Upper West Side and Central Harlem, and runs to the Harlem River Drive above 155th Street, near a public housing development on the site that New York Giants baseball once called home.

The boulevard forms the spine of a 44-block area from 110th to 124th Streets that the city rezoned in 2003, allowing some residential buildings of greater density. In the decade since, spurred by city subsidies and rising values, that southern stretch has experienced a surge of construction, producing crisp-looking condominiums, rental buildings, restaurants and cafes. The boulevard has also been spiffed up in spots north of 125th Street. ""In 1988 it looked like Detroit does now,"" said Willie Kathryn Suggs, a longtime Harlem resident and broker. ""Now, if you're living in the neighborhood, there are people out there all the time, and you don't feel you've got to get out of the subway and jump in a cab to go two blocks.""

For C. Virginia Fields, who lives near Eighth on 138th, the changes represent something of a vision realized. When she took office as Manhattan borough president in 1998, the city owned most of the buildings on Frederick Douglass below 125th; she pushed mixed-income development.

""We did drawings and we scheduled tours, in big Greyhound-type buses, where we brought developers up from downtown as if they were immigrants coming from a foreign land,"" she said. ""Because the properties were city-owned, the buildings along Frederick Douglass were purchased for little or no money, and the developers got tax breaks."" Among the many new residents were the restaurateurs Stephen and Sheri Wilson Daly, who in 2007 fled a tiny one-bedroom rental on East 91st Street, paying $940,000 for a three-bedroom in a mixed-income condo near Eighth. Although delighted with a 25-year tax abatement, the couple were less impressed with the scant restaurant and shopping choices.

""On Friday and Saturday nights from 7 to 9, between 2007 and 2011,"" Ms. Daly said, ""you could watch droves of people heading to Frederick Douglass and hailing cabs to leave the neighborhood because there were so few places to go in the area.""

In response, the couple opened Harlem Tavern, a family-friendly bistro, on 116th and Eighth, replacing a shuttered auto-repair shop. The menu was priced reasonably, Ms. Daly said, ""so we wouldn't alienate the neighborhood; we wanted new residents, but we wanted the old residents, too."" Others have set up shop on the boulevard's new restaurant row. In April, Yvette Leeper-Bueno, who lives nearby in a redone single-room occupancy rowhouse, opened Vinateria, a trattoria that would not be out of place in SoHo. ""This neighborhood's been able to retain its character and still open itself to new and wonderful things,"" she said. ""It's still evolving.""","Private interests, in many forms, follow city investment into a once-blighted corridor in Harlem.",5a7fe6a8-9769-57d9-acfa-e7ce0b1b908b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/05/realestate/5-Living/5-Living-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=378&w=600&s=6f026a183c769785011a82ab780feedccc884fa8056d8c3a6ebb54d813a4d038&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Morningside Park, with the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in the background, is one of the  parks near this revitalized corridor of Harlem.",5a7fe6a8-9769-57d9-acfa-e7ce0b1b908b,N24News/imgs/5a7fe6a8-9769-57d9-acfa-e7ce0b1b908b.jpg,7
Food,Whole-Grain Pancakes to Make Any Morning Special,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/dining/whole-grain-pancakes-recipe.html,"When my mother made pancakes, you knew it was a special occasion.

She'd pull out the heavy-duty stand mixer, separate the eggs and beat the whites until they were cloudlike, then fold them into a batter creamy with cottage cheese. The pancakes would puff when she fried them, each one a tiny, golden souffle ready to be coated in maple syrup. They were delectable, but as rare as double rainbows: an occasional, birthday-special kind of treat.

My pancakes aren't anything like hers.

For one thing, mine are easy, stirred by hand, with no stand mixer required. I don't even need a whisk. A fork can get the job done, so I can make them anytime -- not just on birthdays, but on lazy Sundays in that rustic summer rental, or whenever I get the craving for their crisp edges and a hearty side of bacon.","Hearty and nutritious, but still buttery and rich, these unfussy pancakes come together quickly and without any special equipment.",ce692497-bd64-53c1-bb56-dc82b93c0504,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/20/dining/20appetite1/20appetite1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=827e4526e96a780c010a0e30e787a0b63d122d08b2889701a6d82be5e209dd6b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A mix of whole-wheat flour, cornmeal and oats gives these pancakes an appealing earthiness.",ce692497-bd64-53c1-bb56-dc82b93c0504,N24News/imgs/ce692497-bd64-53c1-bb56-dc82b93c0504.jpg,17
Style,Dunkaroos Are Back. Why?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/style/dunkaroos-return.html,"The favorite snack of '90s kids is back. But why now?

We asked General Mills.

After mysteriously disappearing from American grocery store shelves in 2012, Dunkaroos are back. General Mills announced on Monday that the knuckle-sized cookies with miniature tubs of dippable frosting will once again be sold nationwide, this summer.

How long has a Dunkaroo renaissance been in the works?

It's been years in the making, probably is a fair way to state it. We get literally thousands of consumer requests for the product, since it's not been being sold in the U.S. recently. We knew we wanted to bring it back for a while.

Sports,"In Baseball's Game of Numbers, Yankees Differ on Which Ones Count",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/sports/yankees-statistics-analytics.html,"TAMPA, Fla. -- James Paxton is a starting pitcher for the Yankees, not a statistics innovator. But during the 2018 season with the Seattle Mariners, before his off-season trade to New York, he found a novel way to measure his efficiency and aggressiveness on the mound. Paxton, 30, asked the Mariners' analytics department to give him a printout of a statistic he was tracking himself: the percentage of at-bats that, after three pitches, were either in a 1-2 count or already completed. He named the statistic A3P-- After 3 Pitches -- and monitors it often, rather than relying on more conventional statistics such as earned run average or wins and losses. ""I can't control some of those things,"" he said. ""I try to focus on the things I can control. And I can control if I'm attacking the hitter."" Baseball is saturated with statistics. Want to know which hitters do the best against low fastballs over 95 miles per hour from left-handed relief pitchers? Want to know which outfielders cover the most ground or what percent of the time a similar play resulted in an out? Those can be found in a matter of clicks online.

As the ways to quantify what happens on the field continually evolve, so has the debate over which measurements are best. In modern baseball circles, many traditional statistics no longer hold the same power. ""I don't think batting averages are a thing now,"" said Luke Voit, 28, a Yankees first baseman. In the Yankees' clubhouse, there is a wide range of ways in which players evaluate themselves through statistics, some relying on the conventional measures with others leaning toward the contemporary. A casual poll of players provided a window into their thinking and which skills they value -- or don't. ""I don't look at anything,"" said C. C. Sabathia, 38, who is entering the 19th and final season of a distinguished career that includes a Cy Young Award and six All-Star selections.
* None
* Everyone Loves Ohtani: The Angels' two-way star was a unanimous pick for A.L. M.V.P. and his superfans redefine devotion.
* Phillie Phavorite: Bryce Harper truly committed to Philadelphia and now he's back on top of baseball, winning the N.L. M.V.P.
* Cy Young Winners: Milwaukee's Corbin Burnes and Toronto's Robbie Ray had hit rock bottom before they worked their way up to stardom.
* Baseball Is Stuck in Neutral: The potential of a lockout has a star-studded group of free agents waiting for the dust to settle.
* Free-Agency Tracker: Get the latest updates on signings, contract extensions and trades. ""I don't understand WHIP,"" he added about an oft-used statistic that adds walks and hits before dividing that total by innings pitched. ""All I know is E.R.A., wins and losses. I'm old school in that sense."" Luis Severino, 25, the Yankees' injured ace, may have grown up in a different era of baseball, but he feels the same way. His go-to statistics for self-evaluation are E.R.A. and innings pitched, two categories in which he has led the Yankees' rotation the past two seasons.

His fellow starter J. A. Happ, 36, said he follows win-loss records and E.R.A. because they are ubiquitous. But over the years, he has found himself gravitating toward WHIP after a conversation with R. A. Dickey, a former Cy Young Award winner, when they were both Toronto Blue Jays. ""It started to make sense that generally speaking -- although numbers can prove anything -- that, if you're doing a good job of keeping the walks and hits down, then you're doing pretty good over all,"" Happ said. During a recent spring training meeting, Yankees coaches stressed the need to be aggressive. Paxton takes this to heart: He is among the best in baseball at throwing strikes. In addition to his A3P statistic, Paxton checks on the percentage of first pitches in each plate appearance that were strikes. His goal is to reach at least 70 percent; he was at 66 percent last season, according to Baseball-Reference.com. ""By thinking about this often, and if I can do it consistently, I'm putting myself in a good spot to have success,"" he said. As for offensive statistics, outfielder Aaron Judge, the Yankees' best all-around hitter, regularly checks two statistics during the season to see if he is doing his job as one of the team's main sluggers: runs and R.B.I. And he will examine how well he did with runners on base or in scoring position.

""It still shows value to me,"" Judge said. ""For me, I always look at the guys that are leading in R.B.I. on their team, and usually those teams are doing better."" Another measure Judge cited seemed counterintuitive. At 6 foot 7, Judge is one of the tallest position players in baseball history. But he prides himself on being faster than you would think; 374 players were slower than him last season, according to Major League Baseball's Statcast data. Judge keeps tabs on how often he is scoring from second base on a single or advancing from first to third as a base runner. ""If you look all over the game, you'll see a lot of guys just go first to second,"" he said. ""There's a lot more chances to go first to third than people think. You just got to be aggressive."" Judge's fellow slugger, Giancarlo Stanton, prefers to examine which of his hitting tendencies opposing pitchers might exploit. When scrutinizing his performance with runners in scoring position, he said, he examines his mental approach rather than a popular statistic like on-base-plus-slugging percentage (O.P.S.). Stanton, 29, does check his chase rate, a phrase for the percentage of times a batter swings at pitches outside the strike zone. During Stanton's first season with the Yankees in 2018 after a trade from the Miami Marlins, his chase rate jumped more than five percentage points to nearly 33 percent from the previous season, according to FanGraphs.com. That may have contributed to his decline in overall power production. Several players said they did not focus on any preferred statistics. ""If you look only at R.B.I., then maybe you don't hit much in terms of average -- or the reverse,"" said catcher Gary Sanchez, 26, who is hoping to bounce back from the worst all-around season of his career and return to his 2017 All-Star form. ""It's all important. You try to do it all."" Others said they avoided statistics entirely. Relief pitcher Dellin Betances, 30, said he knew exactly how he was performing without the numbers to break it down. Troy Tulowitzki, 34, the Yankees' primary shortstop while Didi Gregorius recovers from elbow surgery, cited an unheard-of statistic: ""I look at a winning player.""

Tulowitzki pointed to the Yankees' new infielder D. J. LeMahieu, 30, a former teammate from their days with the Colorado Rockies, as one. LeMahieu, a career .298 hitter who once won a batting title, loosely keeps tabs on the quality of his at-bats and his strikeouts. Some players, like relief pitchers Chad Green, 27, and Adam Ottavino, 33, have adapted well to the data revolution in baseball. Even closer Yankees closer Aroldis Chapman, 31, an advanced statistics neophyte, said he has learned since his half season with the Chicago Cubs in 2016 that one applies well to him: his outings usually turn out better when he gets the first batter out. He has tracked it himself since. Ottavino, though, is on his own level. During the season, he checks two statistics he believes reflect how he is throwing: first-strike and walk percentages. At the end of the season, he dives deeply into how he threw the ball, using advanced statistics like xwOBA (expected weight on-base average), which in layman's terms, essentially measures the quality of the contact made against him. He labeled other statistics, like E.R.A. or the scoring percentage of inherited base runners, as faulty. ""We're trying to strip away all the luck factors so you can be as real with yourself as possible,"" he said. ""If you're not doing that, you're going to ride the roller coaster really bad, and you're lying to yourself."" Even if some of Ottavino's teammates are not quite there yet in terms of the game's advanced numbers, the Yankees' robust analytics department is there to help them all break down the multitude of statistics in the game. The players just have to ask.","The team has a robust analytics department, but the players vary widely in terms of which statistics they focus on.",615cc804-c71f-5cd4-888b-d0d494600cc7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/11/sports/11yankees-paxton/11yankees-paxton-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=ea0f4a79b6c580b7da290c4172dbba374bb8d2bb9661f197639a1365d8081d56&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"James Paxton, whom the Yankees traded for this off-season, likes to focus on how he does on his first three pitches to opponents.",615cc804-c71f-5cd4-888b-d0d494600cc7,N24News/imgs/615cc804-c71f-5cd4-888b-d0d494600cc7.jpg,9
Television,"'True Detective' Season 3, Episode 5: A Convenient 'Altercation'",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/arts/television/true-detective-recap.html,"After last week's booze-soaked wallow in the creator Nic Pizzolatto's worst instincts, it felt great to see ""True Detective"" move forward on the case again, even with the occasional hitch in its step. There are important revelations about what ended the investigation in 1980, new wrinkles to its reopening a decade later and a gathering of elderly forces to revisit it again 25 years after that. For the first episode since the opening two, the show gathered power from a meaningful convergence of timelines and the dysfunction of a community more interested in closure than in getting the facts right. The melee in 1980 that ended last week's episode, gently labeled ""the Woodard Altercation,"" turned out to be the breakthrough that put a neat little bow on the original investigation. Brett Woodard was already under suspicion from the police, but his neighbors had gone a step or two further in linking him to the crimes because of his eccentric behavior and his overly friendly way with children. His ambush by a cadre of redneck vigilantes was so inevitable that he had already prepared like Jamie Lee Curtis in the new ""Halloween,"" hunkering down on a property equipped with trip wires, land mines and assault weapons. Survival doesn't appear to be an expectation for Woodard -- he just wants to take out as many hostile forces as he can before he goes. Life was too much for him to bear even before the Purcell kids went missing. For Hays, a fellow veteran, shooting Woodard is another burden he is forced to carry, which would be a more compelling idea if it weren't explicitly vocalized or if Hays's psychic rucksack weren't already bursting at the seams.

But making Woodard the fall guy for Will's murder and Julie's disappearance does bring ""True Detective"" back to the Arkansas of the West Memphis Three, where the desire to find justice quickly prevents a more thorough and credible investigation -- especially when the person or persons involved are societal outcasts. In fact, there hadn't been much follow-through from Hays and West since the early hours of the investigation, at least from what we're privy to seeing on the show. As Freddie confirms in the 1990 timeline in this week' episode, Woodard was puttering along in the opposite direction from where the children were headed. At the time, the one damning piece of evidence connecting Woodard to the crime was the discovery of Will's backpack in his crawl space, but in 1990, with Julie still alive, Hays notes that the bag was left conspicuously undamaged by the explosion. This indicates that someone planted it during the few days in which police were combing through the scene. ""Nobody was compelled to look too hard,"" recalls Hays of the original finding, but the politics of exonerating Woodard 10 years later are equally undesirable. The desire for justice isn't always the same as the desire for truth: Careers made by a high-profile conviction can be upended by its unraveling. There's a reason it took over 18 years for the West Memphis Three to be released from prison -- and under a peculiar plea deal, too. Unsettling a settled case has consequences. Those consequences are particularly substantial for Tom Purcell, who spent 10 years grappling with the uncertainty of his daughter's whereabouts before she suddenly resurfaced. The best scenes in this week's episode zero in on Tom's anguish, which the superb Scoot McNairy plays as three parts authentic to one part performative, an emotionally devastated father who may still be hiding something. His estranged wife Lucy died of an overdose outside Las Vegas two years earlier, and Dan O'Brien, the cousin who briefly lived with the Purcells (and perhaps carved a peephole into Julie's room), passed some bad checks and spent time around Vegas, too. Tom is alone in pleading publicly for tips on his daughter's whereabouts, and he is alone, too, when confronted with a hotline message from a young woman claiming to be Julie, who wants ""the man on TV, acting like my father"" to leave her alone.

That hotline call and the news that Lucy and Dan spent time in Las Vegas isn't incriminating, exactly, but it does strongly suggest that one of Will and Julie's parents had a role in what happened to them. Add to that the ransom note, which echoes Lucy's thoughts about how ""children shud laugh,"" and there's plenty of cause for speculation, all the way up the most recent timeline, when Hays finally gets around to reading his wife's book. In the decade between the first and second timelines, however, there's a bond between Tom and West that the show has introduced without yet defining how it developed. At a minimum, West seems persuaded by Tom's grief and more willing than his partner to protect him from additional stress. It's possible to read West's sad state at the end of the episode -- a potbellied recluse with stray dogs and a drinking problem -- as indicative of regrettable choices, although it's also possible that Tom had nothing to do with it. The bounty of clues and disclosures this week do much to counteract the continued friction between Hays and Amelia, which repeats itself from last week. The signs of Hays's hostility and emotional remoteness are present in 1980, when he refuses to accept Amelia's comforting gestures while West is recuperating from gunshot wound. In 1990, with Amelia's book on the verge of publication, he lashes out again at a suburban dinner party with West and his girlfriend, which becomes yet another prelude to makeup sex. Hays's denial of her insight and agency is a fault the show acknowledges -- he wouldn't have missed the ransom note clue if he'd bothered to read her book -- but their scrapes have the effect of marginalizing her in the story, too. Like Woodard, she is reduced to another burden for him to carry.
* ""There surely exists a mutable area of soul where grief is indistinguishable from madness."" In fairness to Hays, I would not have made it far into Amelia's book, either.
* Pro tip: When going over sensitive evidence of a recently reopened murder/kidnapping case, keep the door closed.
* Hays isn't a welcoming ear to the hardships of others, especially a guy like Freddie, who accuses him and West of ruining his life by browbeating him in the interrogation room. (""Please explain to me the trials and tribulations of being a white man in this country."") Pizzolatto heroes are turned off by the weaknesses of others, even as they drown their own sorrows in whiskey.
* ""We do not say 'good night' without 'I love you"" is a genuinely lovely sentiment, patching together the holes that keep opening up in the Hays household. It's more touching still with the knowledge that the bond between father and daughter will not hold.","The melee that ended last week's episode tied a neat little bow on the original investigation. Twenty-five years later, it's coming undone.",bb627285-3c9b-5aeb-8e24-8d8106b192ff,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/04/arts/04TRUEDETECTIVE-RECAP/04TRUEDETECTIVE-RECAP-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=9eace0585e800212dd1a41c09cf82ec24dc3c8269ce4bda88f06f98e8a73e524&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mahershala Ali, left, and Stephen Dorff in ""True Detective.""",bb627285-3c9b-5aeb-8e24-8d8106b192ff,N24News/imgs/bb627285-3c9b-5aeb-8e24-8d8106b192ff.jpg,3
Art & Design,A Dutch Golden Age? That's Only Half the Story,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/arts/design/dutch-golden-age-and-colonialism.html,"AMSTERDAM -- Elisabeth Samson, an 18th-century freeborn black woman, made millions as a coffee planter and exporter using slave labor in the Dutch colony of Suriname. She was one of the wealthiest women of the era, but few people have ever heard her story. That's why her image is one of 13 diverse portraits recently added to a collection of paintings of the city's wealthiest trade groups. Before the additions, the Portrait Gallery of the Golden Age, as it was known, was a sea of all white and mostly male faces. It resides in a wing of the Hermitage Museum in Amsterdam that houses part of the Amsterdam Museum's collection. Among the other new portraits in the display are Elieser, a young black Jewish man who served in the household of a Spanish poet-merchant; and Sychnecta, a Native American man who was once displayed in an Amsterdam human zoo.

Ms. Schavemaker used the show's opening to announce that the Amsterdam Museum will jettison the term ""Golden Age"" for the era in the 17th century when the Netherlands was a world leader in art, science and trade, because that term tells only half the story . ""We believe that the Golden Age is, in a way, the story of the winners, and it hides the colonial past of the country,"" Ms. Schavemaker said in an interview. ""It hides slavery, but also it covers up poverty more generally. Not everyone participated in the Golden Age, not at all.""

The announcement was immediately met with widespread condemnation, and the museum's social media feeds were flooded with negative comments. Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands called the decision ""nonsense"" in a televised interview, and said he would keep using the label. Michel Rog, a member of Parliament with the Christian Democratic Appeal, said the museum's decision was ""too ridiculous for words,"" according to the newspaper De Telegraaf. But it's clear that the tide has shifted in the Dutch museum world, and that leaders of several top cultural institutions are reviewing the familiar ways of communicating history to the public, and seeking alternatives. Many curators and scholars say those institutions have to overcome a colonial mind-set .

""Decolonizing"" takes many forms. In Rotterdam, it means changing the name of a contemporary art center called Witte de With, because the Dutch naval officer whose name it bears was involved in colonial enterprises (his name, incidentally, translates to ""whiter than white""); in The Hague, it comes about through research into the man behind the name of the Mauritshuis art museum, Johan Maurits, a Dutch governor of Brazil, who initiated the slave trade there; at the Van Loon Museum, the Nieuwe Kerk and the Rijksmuseum, it manifests in exhibitions that explore colonial histories and slavery. Pieter Emmer, a professor emeritus of colonial history at Leiden University cautioned that while expanding our perspectives on other aspects of history is important, we should not ""throw out the baby with the bath water. Because that's what's happening now."" ""If you do away with these historic labels, the past becomes a kind of gray mud of indistinguishable facts and figures,"" he said. ""You need to sometimes typify a period, even if historic labels cover only a part of historical reality,"" he added. ""If you want to use terms like 'the Age of Poverty,' or 'the Age of Slavery,' or 'the Age of Disease,' that applies to all ages. That's not what makes the period stand out."" Jorgen Tjon A. Fong, the curator of the ""Dutch Masters Revisited"" display at the Hermitage, said there's good reason to get rid of vague terms that only apply to select groups of people.

""If you talk about the Golden Age, people think they know what that story is about,"" he said. ""What we forget to tell is that it was only about 1 percent of society. People in Holland were stricken by poverty, there were internal wars going on, and on top of that there was slavery as well. The people in the Netherlands today are not just descendants of that 1 percent; they're descendants of the 99 percent as well."" Using the more neutral term ""17th century,"" he added, means ""You can load it with new stories and new perspectives.""

Taco Dibbits, the director of the Rijksmuseum, said in an interview that the museum will keep using the term Golden Age, especially when it refers to 17th-century Dutch painters represented by Rembrandt, Vermeer, Frans Hals and other old masters. But, he added, the museum ""wants to give a more complete picture of history by adding other perspectives."" The museum has recently changed some of the terms it uses, removing words such as ""Negro"" and ""dwarf"" from art works and their descriptions. More significantly, the museum is addressing the less golden aspects of Dutch history by putting together the major exhibition, ""Slavery,"" set to open in September 2020. The show will center on the stories of 10 individuals, from enslaved people to boat-builders and colonial governors, who played a role in the Dutch slave trade, and part of it will be incorporated into a permanent display at the Rijksmuseum when the exhibition closes. Admiral Witte de With was an officer with the Dutch East India Company, which was a key player in the slave trade, and his narrative tells part of that story. That's why the Rotterdam art center is not only changing its name, but engaging the local community in the process, as ""part of making visible colonial legacies,"" according to Sofia Hernandez Chong Cuy, the museum's director.

The art center was named in the 1980s, she pointed out, after the street where it's located, Witte de Withstraat, so that it could become a destination in a part of the old city center that didn't have much commerce. Today it is thriving, in part because the art center turned it into a cultural hub. ""The name fulfilled its mission,"" Ms. Hernandez Chong Cuy said. ""But our larger mission is to present art and theory, and if we are true to our mission and our values now, the name creates a number of obstacles for us to achieve our goals."" The museum has invited a diverse group of young people to collaborate in the process of choosing a new name, she added, but renaming the whole institution will take time. So far, she said, the group has only renamed one exhibition space. The Mauritshuis in The Hague, home to a royal collection of 17th-century Dutch and Flemish paintings, including Johannes Vermeer's ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" and Carel Fabritius's ""The Goldfinch,"" became the center of a media whirlwind early this year when it temporarily removed a bust of Maurits from its display.","Museums in the Netherlands are ditching historical terms and names, and updating their collections as they grapple with the legacy of slavery and colonialism.",f705e4ba-a0e2-5fcb-9ab4-d5996e138152,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/arts/27dutch-mauseums3/27dutch-mauseums3-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=6c8b359bcfa668418e447fbb862ce5c6f18504415d748bcbd687b7b707f66170&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""Typhoon as Elieser"" by Humberto Tan, features Typhoon, a dutch rapper, dressed as a 17th-century servant.

Style,You Have Idris Elba's Full Attention,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/style/idris-elba-interview.html,"I don't know how to break it to Idris Elba. So I just say it. ""Is Kate Winslet really the woman you want to be stuck with when disaster strikes in freezing weather? You do know that she didn't move over to make room on that door and Leo slipped into the icy Atlantic?"" The British actor laughs. He is sitting atop the New York skyline in a dining room at the Mandarin Oriental. ""Kate Winslet is surprisingly resilient to almost anything,"" he says. ""I mean, she is a bruiser. Tough. As. Nails. And if we were ever to fall off a real mountain, her and I, we would survive because she's not like a slouch in any shape or form."" And, to be fair, Ms. Winslet did hoist Richard Branson's mother down some stairs after a lightning bolt in a hurricane sparked a fire that engulfed the Branson holiday home on Necker Island, where she and her children were staying in 2011. That was when she met her husband, Mr. Branson's nephew, a.k.a. Ned Rocknroll, when he rushed into the burning house with a headlamp. ""She was just like, 'That guy's for me,""' Mr. Elba says. The actor is starring with Ms. Winslet in the ""The Mountain Between Us,"" based on a novel about strangers who struggle, snuggle and eat roasted mountain lion in the frigid Utah wilderness after their small plane crashes.

Mr. Elba often plays opposite very strong women, and he says that's fine with him. His Ghana-born ""Mum"" is so into tough love, he says, that at his 45th birthday party recently, she turned her cheek away when he went to kiss her. Mr. Elba also portrays the New York lawyer who defends Molly Bloom, the audacious poker madam to the stars played by a fiery Jessica Chastain in the Aaron Sorkin movie, ""Molly's Game,"" out Nov. 22. And the actor created one of the most memorable romances in TV history in the popular BBC series ""Luther,"" when his London homicide detective in the big tweed overcoat, known by his deputies as ""his satanic majesty,"" gets in an erotic and psychopathic entanglement with a latter-day Lizzie Borden, played with film-noir panache by the flame-haired Ruth Wilson. ""I think powerful women are sexy,"" he says. ""But powerful, dangerous women? It's like, woooo."" Mr. Elba confesses that he got jittery during his sex scene with Ms. Winslet because he hasn't done that many. ""I was a bit nervous because it was Kate Winslet, number one,"" he says, slyly, and her breasts were exposed. ""Do I look, do I not look? Am I supposed to kiss?"" In a world where most movies disappoint and true stars are rare, Mr. Elba is magnetic. He is tall and muscular, and before he hit the big time as the drug lord Stringer Bell in ""The Wire,"" he was a bouncer (and pot dealer) at the comedy club Carolines on Broadway, sometimes living in his Chevy Astro van.

He is leaner than he looks on screen, with a small hoop earring, a gray-flecked beard and elaborately tattooed arms. A tree climbs his upper arm. ""I have a spiritual connection to trees,"" he says. ""I kind of use trees as a place to pray."" His daughter's name, Isan, is also tattooed on his arm. (She is with him in New York, upstairs in his hotel suite.) And he has a line of a song inked: ""This train carries no wrongdoers,"" to indicate that he does not want the people in his life to let him down. He is wearing a snug gray polo shirt and black jeans from his own clothing collection, with a small ""IE"" emblazoned. When Amy Pascal was head of Sony, she suggested that Mr. Elba might take over the James Bond role if Daniel Craig ever ""hung up his tuxedo."" As a producer of ""Molly's Game,"" Ms. Pascal said that they cast Mr. Elba as the lawyer because ""if you had to put yourself in someone's hands, whose hands would you want? He is like the best version of masculinity. All his complicated contradictions make every character he plays fascinating. Maybe it's the way he walks, like his legs are more powerful than anyone else, like he is gravity. He always seems like he is in the midst of a moral struggle, but he is the calmest one in the room. It's rare, undeniable movie star stuff."" I remark to him that race seems beside the point in his romantic liaisons on screen. ""Yeah, my leading ladies have been both black and white and I haven't thought about it consciously,"" he says. ""You know, a good friend of mine, a black producer, said to me, 'Are you sure about the ""Mountain"" movie, man? Do you think the black audience is going to go for that?""' (In the book, his character, a surgeon, was white.) He said it had not come up except during a Facebook Live video, when a woman asked if the movie was advocating greater trust between the races during a divisive time in this country.

Growing up poor as the son of African immigrants in a part of East London called Canning Town, he says, ""it was common to be called a black bastard as you walked down the street. Did it make me a racist against white folks? Not really. The nationalist front had a strong hold in Canning Town, and it was a party that was very vocal about a sort of separatism. I hate to say it, but it was a little bit of a storm in a teacup. Here I am, a product of Canning Town and I'm not that guy that's like, 'Hey, let's all be separate because I was called a black bastard once.""' I wonder what he thinks about the intense debate over the plans by the creators of ""Game of Thrones"" -- two white men -- to make ""Confederate,"" a series envisioning a post-Civil War America in which the South won. (Husband and wife Nichelle Tramble Spellman and Malcolm Spellman, who are black, will write and produce.) Ta-Nehisi Coates, in The Atlantic, presented the case for HBO dropping the show: ""the symbols point to something Confederate's creators don't seem to understand -- the war is over for them, not us."" On the other hand, John Ridley, an African-American writer and producer who made ""12 Years a Slave,"" brought up, in The Hollywood Reporter, Norman Jewison's ""powerful stories about race and identity"" in movies like ""In the Heat of the Night."" Mr. Ridley worried that the ""litmus test"" could be flipped and prevent him from making a movie about Hispanics, for instance. ""Actually,"" Mr. Elba says about the uproar, ""I personally don't want to see any more slave films. I think it's a time that's been very well documented. '12 Years a Slave,' although a genius movie, I just found it really hard to watch and didn't want to go back down that road for the sake of entertainment. I think there are a lot more interesting stories that are less covered that we can spend our time on."" I also ask for his response to the kerfuffle when Samuel L. Jackson complained about black British actors getting leads in American movies, such as David Oyelowo playing Martin Luther King Jr. in ""Selma"" and Daniel Kaluuya in the Jordan Peele horror film, ""Get Out.""

""They think they're better trained, for some reason, than we are because they're classically trained,"" Mr. Jackson told Hot 97, the New York radio station, in March. ""I don't know what the love affair is with all that."" He said he thought that ""Get Out,"" a movie about white liberal racism, should have featured ""an American brother who really feels that."" Mr. Elba says: ""I spoke on this and I spoke quite openly that I was disappointed."" He got a standing ovation when he made a speech to British Parliament last year urging greater diversity in film and television because he could only play so many ""best friends,"" ""gang leaders"" or ""athletic types."" (It was around the same time he got snubbed by the Oscars, failing to receive a nomination for his powerful performance as a brutal African warlord with a child army in ""Beasts of No Nation,"" and wasn't even invited to the ceremony.) He calls Mr. Jackson ""a god"" who gets respect ""as an actor, black, white, whatever,"" but adds: ""It felt like a very stupid thing to say, if I'm really honest and in a time where people are being marginalized, why marginalize us even further by going on about black Americans and English Americans? And to his credit, he read that and apologized. He called and said, 'Hey, man. I agree. You're right, black is black.' I respect him for actually acknowledging what I said and sort of rethinking it. ""Americans come into England to the theater and play English characters all day long and no one pipes up and says, 'Hey, you can't do that,' and no one should. It's called acting for a reason."" I wonder why it's harder for Americans to get a British accent right than vice versa. ""Something to do with the way the tongue sits in the mouth, believe it or not,"" he says. ""But when the English speak, we speak more frontal and it's harder for Americans to get that sound because the tongue is so much more relaxed. I've studied it."" He did worry about the East Coast accents for ""The Wire"" and ""Molly's Game,"" however. Just as he was nervous to make love on screen with Ms. Winslet, he says he was nervous to speak the high-velocity words of ""the oracle,"" as he calls Mr. Sorkin, especially since it was the writer's first directing gig.

Mr. Cameron got throttled, but he is right that it's easier for the suits who run Hollywood to accept a gorgeous young woman in a sexy costume than to make movies with middle-aged, non-cartoony heroines struggling with life, the kind Bette Davis and Joan Crawford used to do. ""Cameron has a point to some degree, but come on!"" Mr. Elba says. ""Let's be positive -- it's a character created for TV in the '70s and she kicks ass in the movie. Change is incremental, O.K.? First you can't have a black guy kissing a white woman. But then you can have a light-skinned black kissing a white woman. And then it changes, you know. So first you can have a lead woman and she is the hero, but she has to be slightly sexualized. It's going to change."" I ask how he handled the critical drubbing given to ""The Dark Tower,"" based on the Stephen King magnum opus, in which he played the Gunslinger. The New York Times's Manohla Dargis called it ""an unappealing hash of moviemaking cliches"" but still praised Mr. Elba's ""irrepressible magnetism and man-of-stone solidity."" ""I don't tend to read reviews but this was inescapable,"" he says. ""Cause it made such a big fanfare - 'Dark Tower' is coming out!' And the reviews really beat it up. I didn't take it personally but I was like, ooof, that hurts."" But the Brit, who comes from a country with much tighter gun-control laws, agonized over taking the part of the interplanetary vigilante, telling Esquire, ""I had a clash of conscience with my character. In America, there's a real awareness of gun culture."" Luther, the London lawman, is about reasoning, not shooting.

His father once advised him to look people in the eyes. It was the same technique Alfred Hitchcock used when he directed the great actress Eva Marie Saint in her sultry performance opposite Cary Grant in ""North by Northwest."" In our A.D.D. planet, it works. Mr. Elba does not look away at his phone, at the waitress when he asks for a knife, at his publicists trying to hustle him along or at his steak salad and steak and eggs. His expressive brown eyes are always on you. His vibe is cool but his career is frenetic. When he's not starring in movies and ""Luther,"" he's directing movies, designing clothes, D.J.-ing in London and Ibiza, and producing his own music, as well as making documentaries about his adventures kickboxing in Thailand and car racing in Ireland. Maybe that's why his personal life is so turbulent; he has vowed never to marry again. He has had two children -- a 15-year-old girl and a 3-year-old son -- with two makeup artists, one of whom he married, and a brief second marriage to a lawyer. He publicly stepped out with his new girlfriend, Sabrina Dhowre, a former Miss Vancouver, at last month's debut of ""Molly's Game"" at the Toronto International Film Festival. He met her when he went to Vancouver and British Columbia (standing in for Utah) to make ""The Mountain Between Us."" ""Falling in love while falling in love,"" he says, dreamily. He also experienced that ""You are not the father"" moment that can either be the worst or best moment of a man's life. In a therapeutic moment four years ago, he told a GQ reporter the ""tragic, punch-in-the-face"" story of how he discovered that the son he thought he had had with a woman he was involved with in Florida was not his.

""They just have so much of who I am wrong, they feel like I must be a playboy. I must be noncommittal. I must be the kind of guy that jumps in and out. And, you know, I suppose if you look at my history or you know anything about my history or you can read on Google who I was married to or what's happened, you know, it might appear that way. But it's completely misunderstood. People think they know about me and my past and my relationships and they don't. There's very few people that can say they really, really know me and I can say, 'Yes, you really, really know me.' Very few people. Very few."" I ask him about a rap lyric he wrote that fame brings you to the ""devil's door."" ""I live a duality, do you know what I mean?"" he says. ""I got an O.B.E. It's Officer of the British Empire, but I've always known it as a British sweetheart, treasured. ""But I'm a naughty boy. Do you know what I'm saying? I sort of live a full life, and naughty. And I'm one knock away from the devil's door. Because, you know, I'm human, man. But at the same time, I'm honored by my country and I'm like, yeah,"" as long as he doesn't mess up or be a jerk, he says, using raunchier words. ""There's responsibility to be a leader on the right moral side. Don't go out there and get coked off your face and get caught in orgies. Not that I would."" I reassure him that Mick Jagger has been knighted, so other naughty boys are in the Queen's pack of aces. And I wonder if there's any other challenge on the horizon, noting that he would make a remarkable Othello. ""Don't like the story,"" he says brusquely. ""Jealousy's a real poison and I'm not into it,"" he says. Is that because you get jealous? ""It's a poison,"" he repeats, laughing. As we get ready to leave, I pose the question I know Mr. Elba doesn't like: ""I have to ask about James Bond because George Clooney has now said you would be a 'perfect James Bond and it would be a great step forward.""'","He does not look away at his phone, the waitress, his publicists or his steak salad.

Books,How Did the Nazis Gain Power in Germany?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/books/review/benjamin-carter-hett-death-of-democracy.html,"THE DEATH OF DEMOCRACY 

Hitler's Rise to Power and the Downfall of the Weimar Republic 

By Benjamin Carter Hett

 Illustrated. 280 pp. Henry Holt & Company. $30. We ask about the rise of the Nazis from what we think is a great distance. We take for granted that the Germans of the 1930s were quite different from ourselves, and that our consideration of their errors will only confirm our superiority. The opposite is the case. Although Benjamin Carter Hett makes no comparisons between Germany then and the United States now in ""The Death of Democracy,"" his extremely fine study of the end of constitutional rule in Germany, he dissolves those comforting assumptions. He is not discussing a war in which Germans were enemies or describing atrocities that we are sure we could never commit. He presents Hitler's rise as an element of the collapse of a republic confronting dilemmas of globalization with imperfect instruments and flawed leaders. With careful prose and fine scholarship, with fine thumbnail sketches of individuals and concise discussions of institutions and economics, he brings these events close to us. The Nazis, in Hett's account, were above all ""a nationalist protest movement against globalization."" Even before the Great Depression brought huge unemployment to Germany, the caprice of the global economy offered an opportunity to politicians who had simple answers. In their 1920 program, the Nazis proclaimed that ""members of foreign nations (noncitizens) are to be expelled from Germany."" Next would come autarky: Germans would conquer the territory they needed to be self-sufficient, and then create their own economy in isolation from that of the rest of the world. As Goebbels put it, ""We want to build a wall, a protective wall."" Hitler maintained that the vicissitudes of globalization were not the result of economic forces but of a Jewish international conspiracy. Hett, a professor of history at Hunter College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, sensitively describes a moral crisis that preceded a moral catastrophe. If Jews were held responsible for what happened in Germany, then Germans were victims and their actions always defensive. Political irresponsibility flowed from the unfortunate example of President Paul von Hindenburg. He was famous as the victor in a battle on the Eastern Front of World War I, even though the credit was not fully deserved. Hindenburg could not face the reality of defeat on the Western Front in 1918, and so spread the lie that the German Army had been ""stabbed in the back"" by Jews and Socialists. This moral weakness of one man radiated outward. Once Hindenburg won the presidential elections of 1925, Germany was trapped by his oversensitivity about a reputation that would not withstand scrutiny. He believed that only he could save Germany, but would not put himself forward to do so, for fear of damaging his image. Without Hindenburg's founding fiction and odd posturing, it is unlikely that Hitler would have come to power.

As Hett capably shows, the Nazis were the great artists of victimhood fiction. Hitler, who had served with German Jews in the war, spread the idea that Jews had been the enemy within, proposing that the German Army would have won had some of them been gassed to death. Goebbels had Nazi storm troopers attack leftists precisely so that he could claim that the Nazis were victims of Communist violence. Hitler believed in telling lies so big that their very scale left some residue of credibility. The Nazi program foresaw that newspapers would serve the ""general good"" rather than reporting, and promised ""legal warfare"" against opponents who spread information they did not like. They opposed what they called ""the system"" by rejecting its basis in the factual world. Germans were not rational individuals with interests, the reasoning went, but members of a tribe that wanted to follow a leader (Fuhrer). Much of this was familiar from Italian Fascism, but Hitler's attempt to imitate Mussolini's March on Rome failed. When Hitler tried a coup d'etat in 1923, he and the Nazis were easily defeated and he was sentenced to prison, where he wrote ""Mein Kampf."" In Hett's account, the electoral rise of the Nazis in the late 1920s and early 1930s had less to do with his particular ideas and more to do with an opening on the political spectrum. The Nazis filled a void between the Catholic electorate of the Center Party and a working class that voted Socialist or Communist. Their core constituents, Hett indicates, were Protestants from the countryside or small towns who felt themselves to be the victims of globalization. Did the Nazis come to power through democratic elections? In Germany in the 1930s, as elsewhere, elections continued even as their meaning changed. The fact that the Nazis used violence to intimidate others meant that elections were not free in the normal sense. And the system was rigged in their favor by men in power who had no use for democracy or for democrats. The Nazis were by no means the handmaidens of German industry or the German military but, as Hett argues, both businessmen and officers formed lobbies in the late 1920s that aimed to break the republic and its bastion, the Social Democrats. They tended to confuse their particular interests in lower wages and higher military spending with those of the German nation as a whole. This made it easy to see the Social Democrats as foreign and hostile.

In a similarly titled book, ""How Democracies Die,"" the political scientists Daniel Ziblatt and Steven Levitsky have recently argued that the killers of democracy begin by using the law against itself. Constitutions break when ill-motivated leaders deliberately expose their vulnerabilities. Certainly this was the case in Germany in 1930. President Hindenburg was technically within his rights to dissolve the Reichstag, name a new chancellor and rule by decree. By turning what was meant to be an exceptional situation into the rule, however, he transformed the German government into a feuding clique disconnected from society. Governments dependent upon the president had no reason to think creatively about policy, despite the Great Depression. Voters flowed to both extremes, to the Communists and even more to the Nazis. The Nazis took advantage of an opportunity created by people who could destroy a republic while lacking the imagination to see what comes next. When elections were called in 1932, the purpose was not to confirm democracy but to bring down the republic. Hindenburg and his advisers saw the Nazis as a group capable of creating a majority for the right. The elections were a ""solution"" to a fake crisis that had been, as Hett puts it, ""manufactured by a political right wing that wanted to exclude more than half the population from political representation and refused even the mildest compromise."" It did not occur to the president's camp that the Nazis would do as well as they did, or that their leader would escape their control. And so the feckless schemes of the conservatives realized the violent dreams of the Nazis. The Nazis won 37 percent of the vote in July, 33 percent in a November election, and Hitler became chancellor in January 1933. A few weeks later, he used the pretext of the arson of the Reichstag to pass an enabling act that in effect replaced the constitution. Hindenburg died in 1934 believing that he had saved Germany and his own reputation. In fact, he had created the conditions for the great horror of modern times. Hett's book is implicitly addressed to conservatives. Rather than asking how the left could have acted to stop Hitler, he closes his book by considering the German conservatives who aided Hitler's rise, then changed their minds and plotted against him. Following the recent work of Rainer Orth, Hett says that the Night of the Long Knives, the blood purge of June 1934, was directed mainly against these right-wing opponents. The conclusions for conservatives of today emerge clearly: Do not break the rules that hold a republic together, because one day you will need order. And do not destroy the opponents who respect those rules, because one day you will miss them.","Benjamin Carter Hett's ""The Death of Democracy"" traces the fall of the Weimar Republic and the rise of the Third Reich.",d254cf95-c500-57aa-b5a8-59544857c821,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/17/arts/17Snyder1/17Snyder1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=311&w=594&s=04ba46525a7ecb454dff940bb5501df1bac97b0cb683fa812703fc6eb012313e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Joseph Goebbels speaks at a Nazi rally.,d254cf95-c500-57aa-b5a8-59544857c821,N24News/imgs/d254cf95-c500-57aa-b5a8-59544857c821.jpg,13
Food,What to Cook Right Now,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/dining/what-to-cook-right-now.html,"Good morning. I was married on this day nearly 20 years ago, a rainy, windswept afternoon on the East End of Long Island, the wedding party standing beneath the American flag at the Legion Hall as if auditioning for a high-school production of ""Our Town."" The D.J. cued up Desmond Dekker afterward, and there were raw clams and oysters for all. It was pretty great. I'd like to have the best clam chowder (above) with the kids for dinner tonight in celebration, and to play ""Israelites"" loud while I clean up afterward. Maybe you could join us in cooking or at least in spirit? Marriage is a good institution.

If there's time, I'd like to get going tonight as well on this make-ahead pork barbecue situation that David Tanis ginned up for us. If I can knock down the roasting part this evening, I can rip the meat off the bones tomorrow, reheat it and serve it shredded on sandwiches, with cabbage salad (you'll see the recipe for that at the end of the one for the meat). That is a big-flavor dinner right there.

Hit the farmers' market midweek for rhubarb and chicken, and you can make Melissa Clark's new recipe for roast chicken with a rhubarb glaze. The rhubarb, sliced and spiced with coriander and ginger, then sprinkled with sugar, roasts in the same oven as the bird, though in a separate pan. It goes soft and syrupy while remaining tart, and you can brush its sauce on the roasting bird to help take its skin crisp and bronze. Melissa serves the meat with buttery polenta. I like that idea.

Have you seen our new recipe for green goddess broiled salmon with potato, cucumber and snap peas? Or this one, for quick beef ragu with broken lasagna noodles? Maybe you could make those this week. I just re-upped my recipe for poundcake and strawberries. Even if you make that with store-bought cake and industrial strawberries, I'm telling you: It'll change the color of your mood ring.","David Tanis has a great new recipe for barbecue country-style pork ribs, and Melissa Clark has one for a roast chicken with a rhubarb glaze.",2df806d4-3e8c-510b-97dd-a7e533cbf1af,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/03/dining/COOKING-BEST-CLAM-CHOWDER2/COOKING-BEST-CLAM-CHOWDER2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=c24d7c3990d143ef2b8095d882b0ba1a127bcbb2c42c1ad924ed9dc2ca7fed67&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The best clam chowder.,2df806d4-3e8c-510b-97dd-a7e533cbf1af,N24News/imgs/2df806d4-3e8c-510b-97dd-a7e533cbf1af.jpg,17
Health,Easing Epilepsy With Battery Power,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/25/health/easing-epilepsy-with-battery-power.html,"ALEXANDRIA, N.H. -- For most of his life, Kevin Ramsey has lived with epileptic seizures that drugs cannot control. At least once a month, he would collapse, unconscious and shaking violently, sometimes injuring himself. Nighttime seizures left him exhausted at dawn, his tongue a bloody mess. After episodes at work, he struggled to stay employed. Driving became too risky. At 28, he sold his truck and moved into his mother's spare bedroom. Cases of intractable epilepsy rarely have happy endings, but today Mr. Ramsey is seizure-free. A novel battery-powered device implanted in his skull, its wires threaded into his brain, tracks its electrical activity and quells impending seizures. At night, he holds a sort of wand to his head and downloads brain data from the device to a laptop for his doctors to review. ""I'm still having seizures on the inside, but my stimulator is stopping all of them,"" said Mr. Ramsey, 36, whose hands shake because of one of the three anti-seizure drugs he still must take. ""I can do things on my own I couldn't do before. I can go to the store on my own, and get my groceries. Before, I wouldn't have been able to drive.""

Just approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the long-awaited device, called the RNS System, aims to reduce seizures and to improve the lives of an estimated 400,000 Americans whose epilepsy cannot be treated with drugs or brain surgery. ""This is the first in what I believe is a new generation of therapy for epilepsy,"" said Dr. Dileep R. Nair, head of adult epilepsy at the Cleveland Clinic and an investigator in the pivotal trial for NeuroPace's RNS. ""It's delivering local therapy. It's not taking tissue out; the brain is left intact. And it's unlike a drug, which is a shotgun approach."" Already, Dr. Nair's center has 70 people on a waiting list for the device. Roughly 110 epilepsy centers with sophisticated diagnostic testing have filed paperwork to be able to offer it, said Dr. Martha J. Morrell, the chief medical officer at NeuroPace, based in Mountain View, Calif. That represents most of the estimated 130 Level 4 centers that treat adults with epilepsy. Unfortunately, many patients are not referred to these centers by their doctors until they have spent years, even decades, grappling with their condition.

An estimated 2.3 million adults nationwide have epilepsy, and in a third of them, seizures are not controlled by drugs. Brain surgery can relieve seizures completely, but many patients aren't candidates because their seizures start in parts of the brain that can't be removed, such as those needed for language or memory. Without treatment options, people with intractable epilepsy often find it difficult to hold jobs or to find spouses. They can suffer repeated injuries from falls and burns; their mortality rate is two to three times higher than that of the general population. ""There are people out there who are just desperate for the next treatment,"" said Janice Buelow, the vice president of research for the Epilepsy Foundation. With his neurostimulator, Mr. Ramsey, who is partial to ice fishing and wisecracks, is living on his own in a patched-up trailer heated by an indoor wood stove. Inside is the mounted head of a deer he shot. He drives his purple Ford Ranger to appointments at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. Lately, he's started to look for part-time work. But he's cautious. ""Because of my epilepsy, a lot of people don't want to take the risk,"" he said. His treatment has been more successful than most. In a randomized clinical trial of 191 people at 32 sites, patients received stimulators but did not know whether they were activated or not. Those with stimulators activated reported a 38 percent reduction in seizures over three months, compared to a 17 percent decrease among those whose stimulators were not, according to the results published in Neurology. Over two years, 90 subjects with the devices turned on experienced a 50 percent or greater reduction in seizures. Until he received a stimulator in 2008, Andrew Stocksdale, 32, of Mansfield, Ohio, experienced up to 20 seizures a day. By contrast, in the past month, he's had three. He is now married, holds a full-time job, and has a newborn son. ""My life fell together like a jigsaw puzzle,"" Mr. Stocksdale said. ""I was afraid to have a son before. I couldn't do things. I was afraid of falling. I couldn't hold him.""

Implantation surgery requires two days in the hospital, but extensive evaluation is necessary beforehand, including days of monitoring without anti-seizure drugs. The device, which requires a battery change every two to three years, works only for people whose seizures start in one or two places in their brain. Electrical stimulation delivered through thin wires placed precisely at those places helps prevent an incipient seizure from spreading. By contrast, another treatment, a vagus nerve device -- which is a stimulator implanted in the chest to prevent seizures -- fires ""on a preprogrammed basis with no relationship to what's happening in the brain,"" said Dr. Devinsky of the NYU Langone epilepsy center. Before the RNS is turned on, a patient's unique seizure patterns must be detected, a process that takes months and multiple clinic visits. Then comes a period of trial and error, when the intensity of stimulation is increased or decreased, or the number of pulses altered, to see if the patient experiences fewer seizures. ""I like to call it a smart device,"" said Dr. Christianne Heck, an investigator in the RNS study who is the medical director of the comprehensive epilepsy program at the University of Southern California. ""We actually teach the device to detect specific patterns that represent a seizure for each particular patient."" Soon after Mr. Ramsey's stimulator was turned on, his major convulsive seizures stopped, said Dr. Barbara C. Jobst, the director of the epilepsy program at Dartmouth-Hitchcock, who was also an investigator in the study. But it took three years of tweaking to stop another kind of seizure that resulted in his simply staring.

But if seizures originate over the whole frontal lobe, Dr. Roberts said, the same number of electrical leads are ""much less likely to have the same effect."" Even for patients who are good candidates, access to the new device may be difficult if patients aren't referred to Level 4 epilepsy centers. Such centers tend to be near universities or larger cities. New York City has eight, while no Level 4 centers exist in Montana, Arkansas or the Dakotas. Dr. David M. Labiner, the president of the National Association of Epilepsy Centers, said the ""lag time"" between diagnosis and referral to a comprehensive center ""is still up to 20 years."" Another hurdle is cost. The RNS, with the equipment required to download data, is up to $40,000. That figure doesn't include $10,000 to $20,000 for the surgery, or diagnostic testing. Thus far, insurers have paid most of the expenses for five or so cases since F.D.A. approval, including one covered by Medicare.","A long-awaited device, implanted in the skull, offers hope of controlling seizures for those who cannot be treated with drugs or surgery.",b0ec2d86-1665-5263-8855-cd7b9b02ba11,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/25/science/25EPIL_SPAN/25EPIL-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=ffaf83881a158052eb6ec5ed91faaae64fe54a9ccc82a3e55ecab211aa236652&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Kevin Ramsey, an epilepsy sufferer who has a stimulator in his skull, used a wandlike device to download data on his brain activity.",b0ec2d86-1665-5263-8855-cd7b9b02ba11,N24News/imgs/b0ec2d86-1665-5263-8855-cd7b9b02ba11.jpg,1
Food,"In Search of the Real Bouillabaisse, Marseille's Gift to the Fish Lover",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/dining/bouillabaisse-marseille-france.html,"In Marseille, many restaurants, like L'Esplai du Grand Bar des Goudes, offer some version of the dish most associated with the city: bouillabaisse.





In Search of the Real Bouillabaisse, Marseille's Gift to the Fish Lover

MARSEILLE, France -- In this ancient port city on the Mediterranean, there is no escaping the dark, hot, earthy fish concoction known as bouillabaisse. All around the Vieux Port, restaurants with multilingual menus lure tourists with the promise of an authentic taste of the city's signature dish. One advertises in bright white lights a ""bouillabaisse royale"" with lobster on the side; another features a ""petite"" bouillabaisse at a bargain price. A third has created a "" milkshake of bouillabaisse ,"" while yet another proposes a ""bouillabaisse hamburger,"" a fish fillet in a bun accompanied by fish soup and French fries. Newsstands sell postcards bearing a recipe for bouillabaisse in French and English. Shops offer jars of concentrated bouillabaisse stock and prepared rouille, a sharp, garlicky mayonnaise with olive oil and a blend of saffron and other spices that is used to enliven the bouillabaisse broth.

Bouillabaisse sometimes seems as old-fashioned as coq au vin or blanquette de veau. Here, and all over France, it is often said you can no longer find a classic rendition of the dish, which is something between a soup and a stew. Yet there is also a rumor that bouillabaisse survives, especially in this city, which is celebrating its food this year with an initiative called Marseille Provence Gastronomy 2019 that includes cooking lessons, dinner concerts, wine-tastings, art exhibits and markets. To mark the occasion, a group of elementary-school students painted two large outdoor ""bouillabaisse"" murals featuring the rockfish necessary for the dish. So when I decided to seek out and taste the real thing, I came to Marseille.

It developed over the centuries as a one-pot meal in which poor fishermen threw rockfish -- several species of sea creatures, most of them ugly and at one time unsellable -- fresh off the docks into a large iron caldron of boiling fish stock to feed the family. By the late 18th century, a version was served in restaurants. In 1966, the New York Times food critic Craig Claiborne called bouillabaisse ""a dish that is always good for controversy."" The debate over what constitutes a real bouillabaisse grew so fierce that a group of 11 local restaurateurs drew up the Marseille Bouillabaisse Charter in the 1980s, codifying the ingredients and preparation allowed. Even now, there is no official governmental protection for the name bouillabaisse as there is for so many other French comestibles, from Champagne to Brie de Meaux. Then there is downright trickery. Several years ago, an investigation by a French television channel revealed that many of the restaurants around the Vieux Port used processed ingredients and frozen fish of indeterminate origin. On this visit, I stayed far away from the port area, where I had eaten my first, mediocre bouillabaisse years ago. I also avoided the deconstructed, dressed-up and expensive interpretation at Gerald Passedat's Michelin-starred restaurant Le Petit Nice, on the scraggly shoreline about two miles away. My Bouille Abaisse, as he calls it, consists of three courses: a raw shellfish starter, a selection of classic bite-size fish fillets covered in a light saffron-infused broth, and finally, a selection of deep-sea fish in a thick soup adorned with small crabs. With dessert, the price tag for the meal comes to 250 euros, about $280.

Marseille is a sprawling city that includes 111 neighborhoods called quartiers- villages , and I headed to one of them, the vacation spot Carry-le-Rouet, 20 miles northwest of the Vieux Port, to try what is reputed to be one of the best traditional versions in town. Bouillabaisse was never meant to be served in restaurants on demand; the dish is too expensive and difficult to make for a restaurant to gamble on the chance that a customer might want it. So I ordered it two days in advance from a popular restaurant . The setting was picture-perfect, an open-air balcony overlooking a small port full of pleasure boats. But the meal was disappointing -- the broth was a pretty shade of orange, but tepid and too tomatoey. Its side dish of half a chewy lobster was certainly not authentic.

Success came when I turned to a friend who knows the area. Friends of his who live along the coast suggested another restaurant, and spoke to the chef, who only occasionally makes bouillabaisse but agreed to prepare it for us. On a hot Sunday in June, I drove 40 minutes east along the coastal road to the small fishing hamlet Les Goudes, the farthest point in Marseille before you hit the hidden inlets known as calanques. There is no post office or bank, and the tiny Roman Catholic church is seldom open for services. Clusters of small cottages, some of them no more than shacks, cling to the hillsides. Some were built in the days before building codes, and function with exposed electrical wiring. Many of the families who live here go back generations.

The chef, Christophe Thullier, prepared his bouillabaisse the classic way. He made a stock using tiny scaled and gutted rockfish, fennel, tomatoes, a mixture of spices, olive oil and water. He boiled the stock furiously for 20 minutes until it thickened, then turned it down to a simmer before straining in a sieve. At least five types of whole rockfish had marinated for several hours in white wine, olive oil, thyme, rosemary, saffron, paprika, turmeric and lots of garlic and saffron. Part of the ritual of bouillabaisse is the presentation of the marinated fish before they are filleted and thrown into the simmering broth ""a la minute"" -- at the last minute. The word bouillabaisse derives from the Provencal boui-abaisso, meaning ""when the pot boils, lower the fire.""

Food will always be better at its place of origin, and bouillabaisse purists have always believed that there is a mystical connection between the dish and the city. ""I always feel that part of Marseille itself is cooked right into the bouillabaisse,"" Julia Child said on her television show ""The French Chef"" in 1970. ""You can somehow just taste the flavor, the color, the excitement of that old port."" Perhaps that explains why, however hard it may be to find, bouillabaisse is likely to live on.","During a yearlong celebration of its food, the city is filled with odd versions for tourists and fancy variations for the well-heeled. Finding an authentic specimen took some legwork.",8486476a-8ec8-596e-8c02-d1015673451d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/07/dining/05bouillabaisse5/merlin_156049785_c92e31d2-965c-489d-ae86-c2ee32f5df8a-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=bb9190159dd94dd586d629c1d12769dc522172a98370f599a592167035ba42d2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"At L&rsquo;Espla&iuml; du Grand Bar des Goudes, the dish is topped with a small local species of crab.",8486476a-8ec8-596e-8c02-d1015673451d,N24News/imgs/8486476a-8ec8-596e-8c02-d1015673451d.jpg,17
Art & Design,Masterpiece Rental: My Life in the 'American Gothic' House,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/arts/design/american-gothic-grant-wood-eldon-iowa-whitney-museum-.html,"For four years, Beth Howard rented the famous cottage in the Grant Wood painting ""American Gothic"" in Eldon, Iowa. It is owned by the State Historical Society.

Grant Wood's ""American Gothic"" painting (and all of its parodies) may be legendary, but most people don't realize that the little white farmhouse in the background is real -- that it's located in Eldon, Iowa (pop. 900), that it's owned by the State Historical Society, and that, until recently, it was a private residence. There are only a handful of people who can say they've lived ""inside"" his masterpiece painting. I am one of them. And it was a wild ride. In 1930, Grant Wood traveled to Eldon, not far from the Missouri border, with his artist friend, John Sharp, who was from the tiny rural burg -- a busy railroad hub at that time. They drove past a small farmhouse on the edge of town. It was a humble cottage in the Carpenter Gothic style, typical for that era with one exception: beneath the steeply pitched roof was a pointed-arch window normally found adorning churches. Wood was amused by what he deemed a pretentious detail and asked his friend to stop so he could sketch. It was this house -- more precisely, this window -- that inspired what has become one of the most famous works of art in the world. Wood drew his sketch on an envelope and returned to his art studio in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where he imagined what the occupants of the house might look like. Using his sister, Nan, and his dentist, Dr. Byron McKeeby, as the models, he created a pair of Midwestern characters -- some would say caricatures -- with stern, bordering on sour, expressions. He painted the man, the woman and the house individually, on separate occasions, and titled his work ""American Gothic.""

Its fame did not guarantee the home's protection. Built in 1881, ten years before Grant Wood was born, it changed hands several times over the years, falling into disrepair after a long stretch of vacancy. Even after it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, in 1974, a visitor during that decade was likely to remark with disappointment, ""This is what Grant Wood got excited about?"" In 1991, its last owner, Carl Smith, donated the place to the historical society, which spent nearly $100,000 to restore it. The state continued to rent it out as a residence, to two different Eldon postmasters, a schoolteacher, and -- from 2010 to 2014 -- me.

I laughed when I saw it. It was exactly as Grant Wood had depicted it, his brush strokes capturing every last intricate detail of ""the world's second most famous White House"" -- the front porch and its carved posts, the screen door, the vertical lines of its board and batten siding, the roof shingles, and, of course, the churchy window. In real life it was so much cuter than I expected. At 700 square feet, it was the ultimate Tiny House, like a beach cottage with a view of a cornfield instead of an ocean. A visitor center with a museum and gift shop had been built next door in 2007, with construction funds raised in true rural Iowa fashion: by holding bake sales. I went inside and learned that the house was for rent. Upon hearing the rent was the same price I was paying for my storage unit in Portland, Ore., -- $250 a month -- I decided I wanted to live in this house, in the country, and I followed through on my fantasy.

As meticulously as Grant Wood portrayed the outside of the American Gothic House, I can, with great intimacy, describe every quirk of the inside. And the quirks are many. Take the upstairs Gothic window, for starters, reaching nearly six feet from floor to ceiling. It is bolted shut, unlike the identical Gothic window on the back side of the house, which is hinged to allow the top half to fold down and then swing open in order to move furniture in and out. Even at 5 foot 5, I had to duck when climbing the stairs. I eventually got used to being woken by laughter and high-beam headlights shining toward it in the middle of the night when travelers wanted a photo. Sometimes I would turn on the light and give them a scare -- who would expect anyone to be living there?

By day, a steady stream of tourists came, posing for pictures (and peeking in the windows) dressed in the free costumes provided by the visitor center -- calico smocks with cameos, overalls and black jackets, even the spectacles -- and wielding pitchforks of all sizes. They brought their own props, which included a prized Harley Davidson, a fleet of Stanley steam cars, and a herd of llamas. It was the centerpiece of a Klingon calendar shoot, a bare-chested rock band's album cover, a marriage proposal, a family reunion -- a gamut of creativity daily. Of the 15,000 visitors the house sees each year, a handful were bold enough to walk inside if I left the door unlocked. The hassles were the reason the rent was so low, and also the reason the lease had a special clause reminding its tenant to ""always treat the public in a friendly manner."" I was friendly, most of the time, especially during the summers when I ran the Pitchfork Pie Stand out of the living room. I also taught pie classes, which included a tour of the house. I pointed out the odd half-length bathtub in the sliver of a bathroom, an improvement from the original outhouse. I warned guests to watch out for the square nails poking up from the floorboards, the reason I kept a hammer at the ready.","I laughed when I saw it, exactly as Grant Wood had depicted it.

Music,Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center Cancel Fall Performances,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/arts/music/carnegie-hall-lincoln-center-cancel-fall-virus.html,"She added that the center had seen about $13 million in lost revenue, including ticket sales and rentals of its spaces, since the pandemic began. The center has furloughed or laid off approximately half its staff, and its leadership team has taken salary cuts.

Synneve Carlino, a spokeswoman for Carnegie Hall, said the hall is projecting a deficit of approximately $8 million for the fiscal year ending June 30. It anticipates a larger deficit next year, including the impact of losing approximately $13 million to $14 million in ticket revenue and rental income from the cancellation of its fall season.

Those losses will be partially offset by furloughs of approximately 50 of the hall's 274 full-time employees who had still been working this spring. (Another 80 staff members, including ushers and stagehands, had already stopped working when the hall closed in March.) There will be pay cuts for all employees making over $75,000 a year.

The hall tentatively plans to reopen its three theaters on Jan. 7, 2021, and Lincoln Center aims to follow on Feb. 6. Carnegie's opening night gala, originally scheduled for Oct. 7, will become a virtual celebration on a date to be announced.

New York's theaters have been closed since the middle of March. The Met, which hopes to return with a New Year's Eve gala, has projected that its empty stage will cost it close to $100 million in lost revenue. The Philharmonic plans to return early in 2021. On Thursday, New York City Ballet announced that it, too, would close for the fall, losing its lucrative ""Nutcracker"" run around Christmastime.

Fashion & Style,"At Ralph & Russo, Out With the Critics, in With the Clients",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/fashion/couture-ralph-and-russo.html,"At Ralph & Russo, Out With the Critics, in With the Clients

As couture week began, 600 guests -- a well-coiffed troupe of royal family members and socialites, politicians' wives and businesswomen -- flowed into the Grand Palais on Monday evening and excitedly took their seats for a fashion show. Dripping in diamonds and cocooned in furs, many with bemused-looking husbands in tow, they beamed like small children at the collection, dozens of fantastical gowns with voluminous tiered silk skirts, or encrusted with hundreds and thousands of pearls, sequins and glass beads, or shivering delicately with cascading bouquets of 3-D pleated organza and tulle flowers. Plenty of women enthusiastically tapped on their smartphones throughout the show. But this being Ralph & Russo, they were not just Instagramming. They were buying, too. ""Often we get orders via What's App before models have even left the catwalk,"" Tamara Ralph, 35, the label's creative director, said from her London showroom. ""We cater for clients who travel constantly, know exactly what they want and rarely think twice about making a purchase."" And those purchases can be $50,000 and up. Michael Russo, 36, the label's co-founder (and Ms. Ralph's fiance), echoed the comments: ""These women are very particular and willing to pay that much more for clothes that no one else in the room can have. ""Our offerings and aesthetic seem to be filling a market niche that few others have tapped,"" Mr. Russo, a former investment banker, continued.

And what is this special niche? One that disregards what critics value, which tends toward the unexpected and unique, in favor of what clients want. Few brands illustrate the broadening gulf in couture between the popular and the critically successful better than Ralph & Russo, which in 2014 became the first British couture company in more than a century to be deemed skilled enough to show its collections at Paris Couture Week . It was introduced 10 years ago in London by the young Australian couple, who then had little more than a sewing machine and a lot of ambition. Now beloved by Beyonce, the Kardashian clan, Angelina Jolie and Kylie Minogue, the brand was valued at more than 200 million pounds in 2014, introduced a sell-out range of accessories in 2015 and, last November, scooped the Outstanding Achievement Award at the Walpole British Luxury Awards. But, while plenty of journalists from both sides of the Atlantic attend the Ralph & Russo show, curious perhaps to see what has caused such a stir, few file the kind of gushing reviews that would theoretically coincide with clients' reactions.

""The house stages a lot of client events to make it all very inclusive, and the designers are quite straightforwardly friendly, which accounts for a lot, I imagine, if you're, say, a newly minted billionaire looking for a way in to society,"" she added. Many designers see their role as guiding customers toward a new sense of self -- Marco Bizzarri, chief executive of Gucci, once said, ""If you listen too much to your customers you will never do anything new"" -- but Ms. Ralph is not one of them. ""Ultimately our customers want to look and feel beautiful,"" she said. ""And we are in the business of giving them exactly what they want."" Ms. Ralph's mother and grandmother were couturiers for Sydney high society, and her work maintains a faithful leaning toward a classic and highly feminine silhouette that doesn't overwhelm the wearer. Wedding attire now makes up 30 percent of the house's revenue, largely because of the cost of individual gowns rather than the number that are sold, and many brides choose to have their whole wedding party dressed in Ralph & Russo. Two hundred seamstresses work at the atelier in Hyde Park; there are two showrooms in London and Paris, as well as 10 international boutique openings planned during 2017 in locations like Miami, Macau and Dubai. Last summer also saw a pop-up store at Bergdorf Goodman in New York.

It's telling that retailers are fans of the approach. ""We picked up Ralph & Russo in 2010 just as the brand was emerging and at a time when it was relatively unknown,"" said Helen David, fashion director of Harrods, the luxury London department store that was the first retailer to stock the label. ""It sells exceptionally well; they are also a younger house and therefore adding new categories constantly, which is exciting for the type of clients they work with."" Mr. Russo said: ""The intention has always been to build an empire that spans all product categories. We just decided that the smartest way to do that was from the very top of the pyramid. We want to get on par with those big names as quickly as possible."" He shrugged off any suggestion of a gap in appreciation between old guard critics and new guard clients. ""Our main focus is, and will always be, our customer,"" he said. ""And our innate understanding of our customer allows us to be in this very fortunate position. We listen to our clients' needs and design with them in mind.""",Few brands illustrate the broadening gulf in couture between the popular and the critically successful better than Ralph & Russo.,078508ab-f957-5d49-8947-e2e50271d915,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/25/fashion/25RALPHRUSSO-web1/25RALPHRUSSO-web1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=1a7b7009b3bfc322d19cbe812ea5cd6a470de0b2abcddc3686c8c633542a2bbf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo, the brand's founders, in the Ralph & Russo showroom in the Mayfair area of London.",078508ab-f957-5d49-8947-e2e50271d915,N24News/imgs/078508ab-f957-5d49-8947-e2e50271d915.jpg,19
Fashion & Style,Kim Kardashian West and the Kimono Controversy,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/fashion/kim-kardashian-west-kimono-cultural-appropriation.html,"Another week, another cultural appropriation controversy. Or so it's beginning to seem when it comes to fashion and its faux pas. This time around the lightning rod is Kim Kardashian West's latest venture, announced on Tuesday: a line of ""solutionwear,"" itself a creative take on the more typical ""shapewear,"" which used to be called girdles, and before that corsets. This one happens to be called Kimono. Turns out Romeo and Juliet had it wrong. When it comes to names, there is a lot involved -- at least when attempts at catchy branded wordplay, national heritage and influencer-associated fame collide. Kimono, a riff on Ms. Kardashian West's name that is in line with her other brands (Kimoji and KKW Beauty) and what she said in a statement to The New York Times was meant to be ""a nod to the beauty and detail that goes into a garment,"" quickly became the subject of online charges of ignorant and offensive misuse. Especially because the name was juxtaposed against images by the photographer Vanessa Beecroft of many women of different sizes and colors undressed in the collection.

Ms. Kardashian West said in her statement that she has no plans ""to design or release any garments that would in any way resemble or dishonor the traditional garment."" She also has no plans to respond to the reaction by changing the name. ""My solutionwear brand is built with inclusivity and diversity at its core and I'm incredibly proud of what's to come,"" she said. That includes bras, briefs, shorts and bodysuits, among other undergarments. The line is scheduled to make its debut in July. But while traditional kimonos, which date from the 16th century, according to the Victoria & Albert Museum, have many associations, those tend not to involve lingerie, Hollywood celebrities or reality TV. Hence, the problem.

People became even more incensed when they learned that Ms. Kardashian West had applied for trademarks for her Kimono lines . She has applied for eight, around variations on the name and its design, and in classes that include Clothing and Apparel Products, Leather Products (not including clothing) and Advertising, Business and Retail Services. The application also involves a specific font version of the word Kimono -- a sort of bubbly print created, she has said, by her husband, Kanye West -- as opposed to the general word itself. ""Filing a trademark is a source identifier that will allow me to use the word for my shapewear and intimates line but does not preclude or restrict anyone, in this instance, from making kimonos or using the word kimono in reference to the traditional garment,"" Ms. Kardashian West said in the statement. The nuance was lost in the outrage. As of Thursday morning, a new hashtag was making the rounds on Twitter -- #KimOhNo -- and a petition had been started on change.org by Sono Fukunishi, who wrote of wearing a kimono every day. ""I do not wish to share the word with an underwear brand,"" the petition says. ""'Kimono' means 'clothing' in Japanese.""

The petition calls the use of the name ""horrible cultural disrespect."" As of Thursday afternoon, more than 11,000 people had signed, though it does not specifically call for any action other than demonstrating general unhappiness with Ms. Kardashian West's choice. Ms. Kardashian West has been accused of cultural appropriation before, most recently in April, when she attended her husband's Coachella ""Sunday service"" wearing what looked to many like a maang tikka, the head pendant that is one of 16 traditional Indian wedding adornments; and previously for wearing what she called ""Bo Derek braids."" She has chosen not to engage in the public self-recrimination and apology that has become de rigueur in the fashion world (see: Gucci, Prada, H&M) and has remained silent, at least on social media, during much of the controversy. By Thursday, however, she had decided to make a statement. Perhaps because the chaos had overshadowed the line itself, which was conceived for many different body types and skin tones and is clearly meant to carve out a space in a market somewhere between Spanx and Rihanna's Savage x Fenty lingerie line. ""I understand and have deep respect for the significance of the kimono in Japanese culture,"" Ms. Kardashian West said. In any case, she is not, it turns out, the first brand with no particular kimono-related history to attempt to attach the name to a product.

Food,Leftovers Never Tasted This Good,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/22/dining/leftovers-never-tasted-this-good.html,"Good morning. You'll be making pie dough this weekend. (Right?) You'll be buying wine for the feast. (Or farming out that job to siblings?) You'll be standing in the dining room and staring at the table and wondering how many people really can fit around it before you have to bust out the plywood and sawhorses, the extra-long runner, the chairs from upstairs. (Or is that just me?) Anyway, you're looking at two days of lists, check marks and lots of Thanksgiving self-instruction this weekend, and a lot of physical work on top of that if you've got a yard and it's filled with leaves.

It is no doubt outrageous, then, for me to ask you to make risotto this evening, and not even to eat tonight, but to save for dinner tomorrow. But I will, and here's why: Gabrielle Hamilton wrote about the pleasures of cooking with day-old risotto Milanese for The Times this week, and her recipe for risotto al salto (above) is or ought to be the thing we all cook this weekend, with pleasure and style. It's sauteed risotto, essentially, in Gabrielle's words, ""one perfect, saffron-gold disc on a bone white china plate."" It's outrageous, all right, in the very best way.

So make the rice for that tonight, stir-stir-stir. And then when you're done with the precise labor, you can turn to a dinner of crazy simplicity: hot dogs dressed in the Mexican style, a taste of Los Angeles, a great end to the week.

Saturday and Sunday, you can consider Thursday's feast. There's vegan Thanksgiving to think about, and Thanksgiving appetizers, too. (At least if you serve appetizers on Thanksgiving. I do not. There'll be plenty of food in a minute, and the longer you wait, the hungrier you'll be. I did not wake at dawn, so you might fill yourself with devils on horseback and later decline a second serving of mushroom bread pudding to go with the turkey.) There's maybe the bird to pick up. You'll want to get ready to employ J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's awesome new technique for making roast potatoes better. (Here's the recipe.) Certainly there's this amazing new recipe from Alison Roman to think about making as well, for spicy caramelized squash with lemon and hazelnuts. Thanksgiving is so fantastic.","Gabrielle Hamilton's latest recipe is for risotto al salto, a pancake made with day-old risotto Milanese.",f4f59a3c-bff6-5ddf-99db-c6a9a9675898,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/24/magazine/24mag-eat-copy/24mag-eat-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=599b205205cd04724413a5a84f0a425ed942a687c8d929769b0dee203206f8e8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Risotto <em>al Salto</em>.,f4f59a3c-bff6-5ddf-99db-c6a9a9675898,N24News/imgs/f4f59a3c-bff6-5ddf-99db-c6a9a9675898.jpg,17
Economy,Do Jobless Benefits Deter Workers? Some Employers Say Yes. Studies Don't.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/10/business/economy/unemployment-benefits-hiring.html,"Lorrie Jackson sorting parts at Clips & Clamps, a Michigan company that was flooded with applications for an opening last year.Credit...Sylvia Jarrus for The New York Times



Do Jobless Benefits Deter Workers? Some Employers Say Yes. Studies Don't.

Lorrie Jackson sorting parts at Clips & Clamps, a Michigan company that was flooded with applications for an opening last year.

When Clips & Clamps, a metal forming company in Plymouth, Mich., advertised for a die setter and operator last year, more than a hundred applications came sailing in. This summer, the company sought to hire another operator, offering $17 to $22 an hour and benefits. After three months, not a single person had responded. ""I received zero applicants,"" said Jeff Aznavorian, the company's president. ""I've been dumbfounded."" Mr. Aznavorian, whose grandmother founded the company 66 years ago, has no clear explanation for his hiring troubles. In the Detroit area, there should be plenty of qualified candidates, he said. And Michigan's unemployment rate was 8.7 percent in July, more than double what it was last summer.

""I'm guessing it has something to do with the extra benefits associated with unemployment,"" he said. The $600-a-week jobless benefit supplement that Congress approved in March as part of the CARES Act has been widely credited by economists with keeping the economy functioning through the coronavirus pandemic. Households used the extra cash to pay rent, buy food and cover medical, utility and credit card bills when many businesses abruptly shut and cars lined up for miles at food banks. With the supplement, which ended in July, most unemployed workers got more than they had earned in wages; without it, they fell short of their previous income. So did the supplement simply provide a lifeline, or did it discourage people from taking jobs? The answer has consequences for tens of millions of Americans, particularly those on the lower end of the income ladder; for businesses trying to restore their operations; and for an economy that largely depends on the lifeblood of consumer spending.

Democrats insisted on extending the full $600 payment beyond July, while Republicans pushed for no more than $200, arguing that the extra income deterred people from working. Faced with the standoff, President Trump decided to use federal disaster relief funds to give most jobless workers $300 a week, but officials said the funds would cover only four or five weeks of payments. The issue is likely to continue to resonate through the election campaign. For most people collecting unemployment benefits, there are simply no jobs. Roughly half of the 22 million jobs that evaporated with the coronavirus outbreak have not yet returned. Freelancers, gig workers, the self-employed and others have also seen their contracts and incomes shrink. But what about those who declined to return to a previous job, or take a new one? Turning down a job offer to stay on unemployment insurance is considered fraud and is grounds for losing all jobless benefits. But many states suspended verification checks, and with the flood of claims, keeping track of applicants' job searching can be difficult. So can determining the reason for declining a job. A lack of child care or health concerns related to Covid-19 are generally considered acceptable excuses. Making more money on unemployment insurance is not. On a gut level, the Republicans' argument makes sense. With the supplement, nearly seven in 10 jobless workers got a bigger payment from the government than from their previous employer, according to one study. On its face, choosing to get more money and not work seems more appealing than settling for less and working.

That's the way Carl Livesay, vice president for operations of Maryland Thermoform in Baltimore, sees it. Before the pandemic, the low unemployment rate made hiring a struggle, but now, even with high unemployment rates, he said, ""it's worse than it's ever been."" He has been trying to hire eight people as entry-level machine operators or warehouse workers, paying $12 to $15 an hour. ""Only about 50 percent show up for the interview,"" Mr. Livesay said. ""Only 50 percent of those that we hire actually show up for work the first day. And of those, 25 percent don't make it through the first week."" When he called his 60 employees back to work in early May, he said, some were worried about taking public transportation, so he offered to pay for a round trip by Uber until they felt comfortable. Mr. Livesay, who is on Gov. Larry Hogan's task force to reopen manufacturing, said he had instituted a range of safety and sanitation measures to protect his workers.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. As far as he knows, only one employee, a single father, has been unable to return because of child care responsibilities. Mr. Livesay is convinced that the $600 supplement made it harder to hire.

Within two or three days of the benefit's expiration, he said, applications tripled. When the government approved the $300 replacement, he said, the numbers began to dwindle, even though most states have yet to start making the payments. ""It's free money, so they feel they don't have to work anymore,"" he said. Other employers share his sentiment. One-third of small-business owners surveyed by the National Federation of Independent Business said the supplement made hiring harder. There are, of course, examples that tell a different story -- millions of them. In May, June and July, more than 9.3 million workers returned to a job, forgoing the generous unemployment benefits. And that story turns out to be by far the most common. Researchers at Yale University who reviewed scheduling and time clock data for small businesses said, ""We find no evidence that more generous benefits disincentivized work either at the onset of the expansion or as firms looked to return to business over time."" Five other studies by different groups of economists produced the same results. And in a survey by Franklin Templeton-Gallup, conducted in early August, most people said extra government relief would not keep them from going back to work. One reason is that people generally look ahead. ""The latest results show that Americans rationally understand the greater long-term security of returning to work rather than relying on ongoing government assistance,"" said Sonal Desai, chief investment officer of Franklin Templeton Fixed Income. New research from economists at the University of Chicago and New York University came to the same conclusion. The extra benefits, even if extended, are fleeting. In a recession, the possibility of not getting another job offer after refusing one is scary, as is the likelihood that lower wages and career setbacks could be permanent. Stability is worth a lot.

The desire for security may have something to do with the smaller pool of applicants. Several business owners noted that before the pandemic, labor shortages meant that many new hires were already employed elsewhere. Now, laid-off employees who expect to be rehired may prefer to wait for a callback than switch to a new job. What the result showed, said Simon Mongey of the University of Chicago, one of the paper's co-authors, is that ""it's very hard to rationalize why a worker would turn down an offer of returning to a previous employer at a previous wage"" even with the $600 supplement in place. That was what Walt Rowen, the owner of Susquehanna Glass in Lancaster, Pa., saw. He had to furlough most of his 75 employees for 10 weeks, but afterward most returned to their jobs at $10 to $15 an hour. Problems with child care or family health were the main reasons that some did not, he said. ""We didn't get the feeling that there were very many people at all that made that calculation"" about unemployment benefits, Mr. Rowen said. That doesn't mean there aren't exceptions, as Mr. Livesay at Maryland Thermoform and some other employers have reported, and they can feed a perception that the preference for benefits over work is more widespread than it is. Research economists noted, for instance, that dental assistants in Chicago and New York were less likely than coffee shop workers to return quickly. The reason is that dental assistants, because of their specialized skills, know they are hard to replace, while food preparation workers are not. Some low-paid part-time workers who don't get benefits like health insurance or retirement savings -- or workers with no long-term prospects -- may also choose the generous unemployment benefit package.

That's what Bruce Zoldan, chief executive of Phantom Fireworks, based in Youngstown, Ohio, found when he sought to hire hundreds of workers for a one- to three-month stint earning $12 to $15 an hour during the summer fireworks season. People were interested in a full-time job, he said, but he wasn't able to offer one. Mr. Zoldan, whose pyrotechnical razzle-dazzle lit up the National Mall last year as Mr. Trump watched, said, ""I certainly understand why people would not want to work this particular July Fourth season in my industry."" The $600 supplement caused hiring problems, Mr. Zoldan said, but it was also responsible for his best sales on record -- because it put money into customers' hands. ""I do believe that the incentive checks are important right now,"" he said. ""For the time being, it's something people need. Those people who bought fireworks for the Fourth of July are also going to restaurants, and spending money that keeps businesses going."" That is a point that Wall Street analysts and economists continue to emphasize: that getting money to consumers will keep businesses afloat and workers on staff. Without it, not only will millions of needy Americans suffer, said Janet L. Yellen, a former chair of the Federal Reserve, but ""the overall economy could degrade from its current slow rebound in growth to no growth at all.""",A $600-a-week supplement that expired in July has been credited with bolstering the economy. Its impact on hiring is central to a political fight.,f84fcca0-018b-52e7-adbe-4bfd420888b4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/03/business/03virus-hiring-01/00virus-hiring-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=78800f01ade3927c7f3ec988ecb02fc2cdd0bb9b3f77741c779e8bca2741b447&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Lorrie Jackson sorting parts at Clips &amp; Clamps, a Michigan company that was flooded with applications for an opening last year.",f84fcca0-018b-52e7-adbe-4bfd420888b4,N24News/imgs/f84fcca0-018b-52e7-adbe-4bfd420888b4.jpg,8
Dance,"'The Principles of Uncertainty,' Staged With Joy and Anguish",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/arts/dance/principles-of-uncertainty-bam-maira-kalman.html,"On the jacket flap of her 2007 book ""The Principles of Uncertainty,"" the author and illustrator Maira Kalman briefly explains what the reader will find within -- a fragmented personal diary ""abounding with anguish, confusion, bits of wisdom, musings, meanderings, buckets of joie de vivre.""

Economy,Yellen Says Fed Will Increase Rates Slowly,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/28/business/yellen-says-fed-will-increase-rates-slowly.html,"WASHINGTON -- Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, said on Friday that the Fed planned to raise interest rates more slowly than in past recoveries because of the unusually fragile condition of the American economy. Fed officials, who have held short-term interest rates near zero for more than six years, have indicated that they plan to start raising the Fed's key gauge later this year. Ms. Yellen's remarks, delivered at a conference in San Francisco, offered more details about the Fed's plans than earlier statements, all part of an effort to prepare markets for the end of that prolonged era. And her message was that the return to normal conditions was likely to come slowly. There will be no repeat of the two-year period beginning in June 2004 when the Fed raised rates by 0.25 percentage points at every meeting. ""The average pace of tightening observed during previous recoveries could well provide a highly misleading guide to the actual course of monetary policy over the next few years,"" Ms. Yellen said.

Ms. Yellen's speech was delivered hours after the Commerce Department reported, in its final revision, that the United States economy grew at a rate of 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2014, down from a robust 5 percent pace during the summer months. Economists said that the economy probably slowed even further in the first quarter of this year, which ends on Tuesday. Despite the latest disappointing economic figures, Ms. Yellen emphasized that she saw the economy as improving, describing the current situation as a temporary slowdown during the winter months. She highlighted particular progress in labor markets, and said that she expected the economy to gain steam as consumer spending increased after a slow start to 2015. But Ms. Yellen offered a more cautious policy outlook than some of her colleagues. ""With continued improvement in economic conditions,"" she said, ""an increase in the target range for that rate may well be warranted later this year."" By contrast, Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, said earlier this week it was ""quite likely"" the Fed would raise rates no later than September. John C. Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, and Ms. Yellen's host on Friday, said ""by midyear it will be the time to have a discussion."" Fed officials have said they would closely monitor the course of the economy in determining when to raise interest rates and by how much. Raising rates tends to slow growth and restrain inflation, while keeping rates low helps encourage additional business activity and job hiring.

Lately, even as the job market has displayed healthy signs of life -- the unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent in February as employers hired 295,000 new workers -- other indicators have been anemic. If the economy advances more strongly than most Fed officials expect, suggesting that inflation will eventually gain momentum, the central bank is likely to raise rates more aggressively than if job gains and economic growth are disappointing. This week, the government said durable goods orders fell last month and retail sales were also weak, despite benefits to consumers from low energy prices.

The nation's manufacturers have also been hurt by a stronger dollar and weak conditions in key markets like Europe and Brazil, which has curbed exports. The downshift in early 2015 has echoes of the economy's performance in the first quarter of 2014, when cold temperatures and snow were blamed for a 2.1 percent contraction in output. Next week, the economic picture may become a bit clearer. Data are due on Friday on job creation and unemployment in March. Figures for the trade balance, home sales, personal consumption and construction in February are set to come out earlier in the week. In her speech in San Francisco, Ms. Yellen provided new insight into the Fed's decision-making process. She said the Fed would not wait for price inflation to increase before it moved to raise rates. She also played down the importance of wage inflation, an issue on which her views have evolved significantly.

In speeches last year, Ms. Yellen highlighted the slow pace of wage inflation as evidence of slack in the labor market. But on Friday she described it as unreliable, saying that wages might be stagnating for a variety of reasons including globalization and the decline of unions. ""The outlook for wages is highly uncertain even if price inflation does move back to 2 percent and labor market conditions continue to improve as projected,"" Ms. Yellen said. ""This uncertainty limits the usefulness of wage trends as an indicator of the Fed's progress in achieving its inflation objective."" Ms. Yellen said that the Fed intended to focus on job growth, judging that if unemployment continued to fall, prices and wages would begin to rise. David G. Blanchflower, an economist at Dartmouth College, described Ms. Yellen's conclusions as a ""big mistake."" Mr. Blanchflower argued in a paper last year that the pace of wage growth was the best measure of labor market health. He cautioned on Friday that other central banks, including the Swedish Riksbank, had to backtrack after raising rates too soon. Ms. Yellen said the timing of the first increase, which many experts say is likely to take place in September, was less important than the pace of later ones, which would determine borrowing costs in coming years. And she gave three reasons the pace was likely to be quite slow. First, despite the Fed's campaign to revive growth, the economy remains weak, implying that the central bank's help is still needed. ""If underlying conditions had truly returned to normal, the economy should be booming,"" Ms. Yellen said. Second, Ms. Yellen said, moving too quickly carries greater risks than tardiness. The Fed's tools for reviving growth are already in use; if the economy swoons, it is not clear how much more the Fed can do. And the Fed sees little risk in waiting: Ms. Yellen said she still saw little threat from any overheating in financial markets.","The return to normalcy in monetary policy will be prolonged, the Fed chairwoman said, because the American economy remains fragile.",faaf9e88-9d67-5220-8488-3515e80deff3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/28/business/28fed-web/28fed-web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=8a570245c8c54507b46c37c8493098ca0b1330ef0ea1f2bfe214eb3d69c0ed1d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""With continued improvement in economic conditions, an increase in the target range for that rate may well be warranted later this year,"" Ms. Yellen said.",faaf9e88-9d67-5220-8488-3515e80deff3,N24News/imgs/faaf9e88-9d67-5220-8488-3515e80deff3.jpg,8

""We must prevent that the problems in Cyprus become problems for other countries,"" Mr. Schauble said. He added that if Cyprus were allowed to go bankrupt, there was a ""significant risk"" of contagion to Greece and other vulnerable countries in the euro zone.

As expected, a clear majority of 487 out of 602 lawmakers casting ballots voted in favor of the package, which includes EUR9 billion, or $11.7 billion, in contributions from European Union members.

Food,Lamb Shanks Show Off Their Inner Beauty,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/dining/lamb-shank.html,"Braising isn't pretty, or at least it usually doesn't start out that way. The tougher, bonier and generally less appealing the cut, the better it will braise. When braising, go ugly. Lamb shanks are a prime example. Sinewy, muscled and stippled with cartilage, the shanks need hours of slow and gentle cooking for the meat to soften enough to slip off the bone. But once the cooking is done, the payoff is big: The rich and brawny succulence is matched by few other meats.

Part of what makes lamb shanks so flavorful is the marrow deep in the bones. As the shanks cook, the marrow liquefies, adding the concentrated essence of the lamb to the sauce. This means that when you're cooking meat on the bones, you don't necessarily have to add stock when liquid is needed. The bones have enough flavor on their own.

When shopping for lamb shanks, ask your butcher for the biggest ones in the meat case. The bigger the shank, the higher the meat-to-bone ratio. Plus, large bone-in shanks make for a dramatic Flintstones-style presentation at the table. Or, if you're not feeling like flaunting your inner cave dweller, you can pull the meat off the bones before your guests arrive so they won't have to. Just make sure to moisten the meat with plenty of sauce, which is the best part. You can braise lamb shanks in any liquid, though something with acidity will help cut their richness. Wine is classic. Here, I use white wine combined with a profusion of fresh herbs, which melt into the pot, adding fragrance and body.

This recipe is very loosely based on a Georgian dish called chakapuli, usually a combination of some type of meat simmered with sour plums and tarragon. It's traditionally served in spring, when green herbs are among the first plants to make a comeback after the long freeze. But it's just as good in winter, when cravings for fresh and green things grow powerful. Like most braised meats, the lamb can be cooked a few days ahead; it gets better when the flavors are given a chance to meld. Just reheat it on the stove or in a 350-degree oven, kept covered to keep the meat at its juiciest. You may have to add some liquid as you reheat.",Braised lamb shanks with plenty of fresh herbs brighten up a winter meal.,2a8410f0-c089-5754-82a6-bb042110271d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/20/dining/20appetite1/merlin_131160217_b567e972-0925-4209-b936-f2ec4221a166-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=53eb1b1330f73bd48471375223114b0111e4d7e3c10a413c2e0b0d97d3ebd689&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,This recipe is very loosely based on a Georgian dish called chakapuli.,2a8410f0-c089-5754-82a6-bb042110271d,N24News/imgs/2a8410f0-c089-5754-82a6-bb042110271d.jpg,17
Economy,"Homeowners Have Had It Good. Too Good, Says the Tax Bill.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/business/economy/tax-bill-housing.html,"For decades, the tax code has been filled with rewards for homeownership. Tax breaks encourage people to get into first homes and to trade up as they get older, building a national mind-set that you're never quite middle class until you've qualified for a mortgage. It amounts to a vast social engineering project that assumes society is better off with owners instead of renters. But the tax bill making its way toward final passage is upending that premise. The bill will increase many homeowners' monthly housing costs by scaling back deductions that allow them to reduce mortgage interest and property taxes. And by roughly doubling the standard deduction, it reduces the incentive to buy homes by making far fewer homeowners eligible for preferential tax treatment. Today, a little under half of American homes are worth enough to justify itemizing mortgage interest and property taxes. Under the tax legislation, that figure would fall to close to 14 percent, according to an analysis of the plan by the online real estate marketplace Zillow.

The Republican plan, in short, is tinkering with subsidies so entrenched in the social fabric that they have become entitlements in all but name. ""It suggests a limit in the federal government's willingness to subsidize ownership,"" said Edward Glaeser, an economist at Harvard. ""It's also a reflection of just how expensive housing has become, and how it feels problematic to be using the tax code to support people buying houses that are this expensive or, even worse, to be encouraging housing prices to rise further."" Both parties have long championed homeownership as a way to help people build wealth and keep neighborhoods more stable. But economists like Mr. Glaeser have been critical of the resulting subsidies. In their view, the government has made homeownership and its financing artificially cheap through the tax code and mortgage backers like Fannie Mae. As a result, people are encouraged to take on more debt than they might otherwise -- to buy bigger homes and second homes, and to plow the equity they accrue into renovations and personal spending. This distorts the economy in a number of ways. For starters, it's unfair: Since the benefits of these deductions get bigger with larger and more expensive homes, the bulk of the benefits accrue to wealthier homeowners in pricier markets. This alters the landscape by encouraging more single-family homes and suburban sprawl. That, in turn, prompts the government to spend more on roads and infrastructure and makes housing a bigger portion of the economy than it would be in the absence of federal help.

Construction, though, is one of the least productive industries. By funneling more of the national debt and savings into construction, the government is hindering sectors, like education and manufacturing, that have a bigger economic payoff. All this has made homeowner subsidies, in particular the mortgage interest deduction, one of the rare tax breaks with critics across the political spectrum. Matthew Desmond, a Princeton sociologist who studies how eviction wreaks havoc on the lives on the poor, has documented how the deduction became the ""engine of American inequality"" because it favors higher-income homeowners. Edward J. Pinto, co-director of the conservative American Enterprise Institute's Center for Housing Markets and Finance, has described the interest deduction and other homeowner subsidies as a wasteful giveaway that inflates home prices and encourages people to borrow excessively. ""My basic view is if you subsidize something you'll get more of it, and as a country we've been subsidizing debt,"" he said.

Jeff Neubauer is already thinking more conservatively. Mr. Neubauer, 34, who helps manage his family's electrical contracting business and lives in Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif., is looking to trade up from his two-bedroom condominium to a larger home in the $800,000-to-$900,000 range. Now, he is worried that the cost of ownership will be much higher and will rather play it safe until the effects of the bill are clearer.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""It makes me want to not spend as much money,"" he said. Though it's considered sacrosanct today, the mortgage interest deduction was created almost by accident in 1913. When Congress passed the first income tax, it made interest deductible, a provision intended to help farmers and other businesses deduct their financing expenses. Over the next century, as the government began guaranteeing mortgages and as the construction of single-family homes became a global industry, the mortgage interest deduction ballooned into one of the largest tax subsidies, accounting for more than $70 billion a year.

The size of the deduction made it a tempting target for Republicans. To stay within legislative boundaries, the Republicans need to limit the budget consequences of tax cuts largely benefiting corporations and the wealthy. Reducing housing deductions -- benefits that disproportionately flow to homeowners in wealthier Democratic cities -- helps recover some revenues while concentrating the impact on relatively few people, most of whom are unlikely to vote for Republicans. The bill does retain significant subsidies, allowing home buyers to deduct interest on mortgages as high as $750,000 -- accounting for the vast majority -- and up to $10,000 total in property taxes and state and local income taxes. But real estate agents have portrayed the changes as a full-blown attack on their industry. ""The final tax reform bill released punishes homeowners and weakens homeownership,"" the California Association of Realtors said in a statement issued on Friday, ""and in fact, it looks at homeowners and the housing market as nothing more than a piggy bank."" Earlier versions of the bill prompted real estate agents in Bakersfield, Calif., to protest and chant ""Save Homeownership"" in front of the local office of Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader. And the provisions affecting homeownership were among the few main sticking points among House Republicans, particularly those from Mr. McCarthy's state. According to some estimates, the modification of the mortgage interest deduction, combined with the steep drop in the deduction for state and local property taxes, could lead to home price declines of as much as 10 percent in counties with the highest property and income taxes. It is, of course, hard to gauge the long-term ramifications of a tax bill that is flying through Congress in hopes of allowing Republicans and the Trump administration to claim a major legislative victory. That uncertainty is leading to major confusion for home shoppers like Morgan Molnar. Ms. Molnar, a 29-year-old who works in product marketing, lives in the Silicon Valley city of Sunnyvale and is looking for a home costing $1 million to $1.2 million. She and her husband have been approved for a mortgage and were ready to make offers, but are now feeling hesitant.

Better to push forward because the Bay Area's already-low inventory is going to shrink? Or will reduced tax deductions lower prices by reducing the number of people who can afford homes? ""You're leaning forward but afraid to make that leap because of the situation,"" she said. One thing that seems certain is that the lack of inventory already plaguing the housing market will get worse. By allowing homeowners already benefiting from the existing mortgage interest deduction cap to keep it, the bill is likely to encourage people to stay in place a bit longer. The plan could also affect consumer spending. Over the past two decades, homeowners have become accustomed to using steadily rising home prices to periodically refinance their mortgages so that they can take money out of their homes and spend it on everything from renovations to college tuition and vacations. These ""cash-out refinancings"" were widely abused before the housing crisis -- the proverbial ""people using their homes as A.T.M.s."" It has been less of a problem since the crisis. Today, some 42 million homeowners have about $5.35 trillion in home equity that they could hypothetically tap into, according to Black Knight, a software and data provider to the mortgage industry. This assumes they don't borrow more than 80 percent of the value of their home. Whatever happens, it has led to a chaotic end of the year for real estate agents. Kalena Masching, a Silicon Valley agent for Redfin, a real estate brokerage based in Seattle, has one group of clients trying to push sales through before any tax changes take effect. Another group is holding off to see how the loss of homeowner deductions ends up changing the math of buying a home. ""There's an overwhelming sense of people being upset and a lot of uncertainty, and mostly feeling like it's not a good thing,"" she said.","The tax code has long offered rewards for buying rather than renting, an equation that has troubled some economists — and that the Republican bill upends.",565ee004-2e64-54cd-8170-1af798eb4a83,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/17/business/17HOUSING/00HOUSING-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=fe84e3d73f2bb56a44cdb44d41a2c81e8eb422ed75625fc89cd9718146edeeb9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Politicians from both parties have championed homeownership over the years, but economists see downsides in the tax preferences that have resulted.",565ee004-2e64-54cd-8170-1af798eb4a83,N24News/imgs/565ee004-2e64-54cd-8170-1af798eb4a83.jpg,8
Science,"Steven Gubser, a Bright Star in the Physics Universe, Dies at 47",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/science/steven-gubser-dead.html,"Steven Gubser teaching at Princeton in 2010. He sought to make physics accessible to both students and the general public, writing ""The Little Book of String Theory"" and ""The Little Book of Black Holes.""





Steven Gubser, a Princeton theoretical physicist who did groundbreaking work in trying to unite the two great fields of physics -- quantum mechanics and general relativity -- as part of a broad effort in the scientific community to devise ""a theory of everything,"" died on Aug. 3 in a rock-climbing accident in the French Alps. He was 47. Princeton University, where he was a professor, said Dr. Gubser was in Chamonix climbing Comb Needle, a peak near Mont Blanc, the tallest mountain in the Alps, when his rope broke. He fell more than 800 feet to his death. He, like his father before him, was an experienced rock climber who had scaled Comb Needle at least once before. Dr . Gubser was one of the most accomplished physicists of his generation, making an impact early on. While still a teenager he became the first American to win an international physics competition for high school students. As a student at Princeton he won the highest American award for undergraduate research. And as a young scientist he was cited in Europe as one of the most outstanding theoretical physicists under the age of 35. Dr. Gubser's specialty was string theory, which many physicists believe could solve a fundamental problem in physics: the disconnect between quantum physics and general relativity, the theory put forward by Einstein.

What's called the Standard Model, one of the signature creations of quantum physics, is very good at explaining the workings of three of the four known forces in the universe: electromagnetism; the strong, or nuclear force, that binds together the nuclei of atoms; and the weak force, which is manifest in radioactive decay. But the Standard Model does not account for gravity; Einstein's theory does. General relativity explains how gravity controls and shapes the galaxies and the stars and predicts their movements. But, conversely, general relativity does not address what happens in the subatomic world. That is where the work of Dr. Gubser and others has come in, with its focus on string theory. String theory postulates that fundamental particles aren't particles at all -- that they are actually strings, existing in loops or with loose ends. Those strings vibrate and bend and connect to one another in myriad ways, propagating in multiple dimensions that we cannot see. (In the most prevalent version of the theory, there are 10 dimensions -- nine existing in space and one in time.) String theory -- the so-called ""theory of everything"" -- has never been confirmed through experiments, but the work of Dr. Gubser and others has found a mathematical correspondence between string theory and a class of quantum models akin to the Standard Model of particle physics. That means that string theory could be used to solve problems in traditional quantum theory and that, conversely, traditional quantum theory could be used to describe quantum gravity -- the missing force in the Standard Model. This correspondence has been ""one of the turning points in theoretical physics of the last 30 or 40 years,"" said Dr. Igor Klebanov, director of the Princeton Center for Theoretical Science, who taught Dr. Gubser as a graduate student -- ""by far the best student in the class,"" he said -- and collaborated with him on research papers.

One of their papers, published in 1998, when Dr. Gubser was a doctoral student, has been cited more than 9,500 times, an extraordinary number in the field of high-energy physics. In recent years, Dr. Gubser used string theory to improve the theoretical understanding of black holes -- those gravitational monsters that trap all energy, even light -- and superconductors, the materials though which electrons can pass without resistance. As a professor Dr. Gubser wanted to make theoretical physics more accessible to the public. To that end he wrote two books: ""The Little Book of String Theory"" (2010) and, with Frans Pretorius, another professor at Princeton, ""The Little Book of Black Holes"" (2017). Both were published by Princeton University Press. He also wanted students to enjoy physics -- rather than be cowed by it -- as much as he did. He created one course at Princeton called ""Invitation to Theoretical Physics."" Sometimes he spiced up his lectures with unusual demonstrations. In a short video he made to promote his first book, he showed how electric conductivity works (and sometimes does not work) by connecting one end of automobile jumper cables to a car battery and the other end to a pair of steel rods. He then grasped the rods in his hands. There was hardly any electrical shock to speak of. Skin, he explained, made a poor connection with the steel rods, so little current passed through the body. Outside the classroom, his students might see him pedal by on a unicycle, something he had taught himself to ride. Steven Scott Gubser was born in Tulsa, Okla., on May 4, 1972, and shortly afterward moved with his family to Aspen, Colo. He grew up there and in Denver. He was the second son of Nicholas James Gubser II and Margo Gubser Gardner . His father, a former Rhodes Scholar who had studied anthropology, worked in a variety of capacities while devoting much of his time to rock climbing and mountaineering. Mr. Gubser's mother taught French and sold real estate.

Steven's aptitude for the sciences was evident early on. In 1989, he became the first American to record the top score in the Physics Olympiad, an annual international competition for high school students, and a year later he won a silver medal at the Chemistry Olympiad, another international competition. He graduated from Princeton in 1994. His thesis earned the LeRoy Apker Award, the highest honor by the American Physical Society for undergraduate research. He spent a year at Cambridge University in England as a Fulbright scholar, completing a master's degree there, and then returned to Princeton for further graduate studies, earning his Ph.D. in 1998. Dr. Gubser worked for two years at the Harvard Society of Fellows, taught for a year at Princeton and then joined the faculty of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena before Princeton hired him back as a tenured professor. He received the inaugural Gribov Medal in 2001, a European award given to outstanding theoretical physicists younger than 35, and a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2009. Dr. Gubser is survived by his wife, Laura Landweber, a professor of biochemistry and molecular biophysics at Columbia University; their daughters, Cecily, Heidi and Lillian; his older brother, Charles; and his mother. In 2008 Dr. Gubser and Dr. Landweber were each given a New York Academy of Sciences Blavatnik Award for Young Scientists, he in physics and she in biology. Dr. Gubser and his wife, Laura Landweber, in 2008, when they received the New York Academy of Science Blavatnik Awards for Young Scientists, he in physics and she in biology. With them was their youngest daughter, Lillian. Dr. Gubser's rock climbing put him in the company of many physicists who have shared the same passion -- a phenomenon that the science writer George Johnson took note of in The New York Times in 2001.","He did groundbreaking work toward finding a ""theory of everything.""

Technology,Alphabet's Earnings Disappoint. Blame It on the iPhone.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/technology/alphabet-fourth-quarter-earnings.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Quarter after quarter, investors have become accustomed to Alphabet's revenue and profit growing at a pace that seems to defy gravity for a company well past its start-up years.

But when people get used to near perfection, then ""pretty good"" becomes a disappointment.

Alphabet, Google's parent company, fell short of Wall Street expectations for its fourth-quarter profit, sending the stock down in after-hours trading. Its profits were weighed down by an increase in traffic acquisition costs -- the fees Google pays companies like Apple to ensure that its search engine is the default option when people open a browser on the iPhone.

On Thursday, Alphabet attributed the increase in costs to a rising number of people doing searches on smartphones. Those queries require the company to pay more to reserve screen real estate compared to searches on desktop computers.

Ruth Porat, Alphabet's chief financial officer, said the company expects those traffic acquisition costs will continue to climb. She framed the increased expense as a positive, a sign that Alphabet was establishing an important beachhead on smartphones.","Known for its moneymaking consistency, Google's parent company ran into the increased price of ensuring its search engine is featured on mobile devices.",c7eb08a6-0f82-56c8-920b-ee1c6cbe4714,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/02/business/02ALPHABET/02ALPHABET-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=a1cd02d602a126cd9d9d8663e46a3e9d90495ddde1ea5194dbb34c10269f0bf5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Google booth under construction at the Las Vegas Convention Center for the International CES show last month.

Real Estate,A SoHo Condo Designed by Renzo Piano,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/realestate/a-soho-condo-designed-by-renzo-piano.html,"Davide Bizzi consulted with many of his real estate colleagues in New York before deciding to buy a parcel on the western edge of SoHo, at the mouth of the Holland Tunnel, for a condominium development.

""In the beginning, I was afraid of the tunnel,"" said Mr. Bizzi, a global developer.

But many friends, including Howard M. Lorber, the chairman of Douglas Elliman Real Estate, talked to him about the changing downtown landscape. Neighborhoods that were once considered outer fringes of Manhattan, like Hudson Square to the west, were now bleeding into SoHo and TriBeCa, they agreed, and formerly distinct neighborhood borders were being blurred.

Even the Pritzker Prize-winning architect Renzo Piano, a friend who at the time was working on the new Whitney Museum of American Art, thought the location was good, Mr. Bizzi said. Although the building would overlook tunnel traffic that is often quite heavy, units that were high enough would have a clear view of the Hudson River, because it is unlikely that the low-level tunnel entrance would ever be built over.

""Renzo's philosophy is all about light, openness and transparency,"" Mr. Bizzi said.

Automobiles,"Between Auto Show and Showroom, a Supercar's Mettle Is Tested",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/automobiles/a-supercars-mettle-is-tested.html,"WHEN a troupe of Porsche engineers arrived here on a Monday afternoon early this month, the flamboyant graphic designs covering their cars -- prototypes of the 918 Spyder, a supercar that is more than a year from its market debut -- barely distracted tourists from their preoccupations. Instead of stopping the show, the two otherworldly supercars slipped unobtrusively into a hotel driveway. The engineers were jubilant: a two-week shakedown run, which started in Denver and proceeded through Phoenix on a meandering, blazing-hot route to San Francisco, revealed nothing to imperil the 918 Spyder's scheduled production start-up of Sept. 18, 2013. A plug-in hybrid that combines electric drive and a midmounted gasoline V-8, the 918 Spyder is capable of highly efficient travel (when relying exclusively on battery power) or heroic feats (when the gas and electric power plants fully combine for 795 horsepower). Only 918 examples will be made; delivery to United States customers who have made a $200,000 deposit begins in January 2014, with each car priced at $854,000, not including shipping. While Porsche is experienced in creating ultrafast cars and knows its way around hybrid powertrains and the production of carbon-fiber chassis, the 918's complexity presents new challenges. The Western road test was intended to verify hot-weather performance, which was reported as satisfactory. The project director, Frank Walliser, and his colleagues also worked on harmonizing the car's myriad systems. The engineers looked for hiccups in drivability that would signal a need for further development of the car's software.

""The biggest job today is the integration of the car,"" Mr. Walliser, 43, said during a ride-along session held later that 97-degree afternoon in the Beehives section of the Valley of Fire State Park, northeast of here. The park's landscape of odd sandstone formations, eroded in the 150 million years since the Jurassic period, provided a contrasting setting for the futuristic Porsche. Against a low sun, with the rocks changing hues to sometimes match Mr. Walliser's orange T-shirt, it seemed as if a John Ford western might break out. Those who found the 918 Spyder design study so mesmerizing when it was introduced at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show would not be disappointed with the prototypes. Spattered and smudged from the journey up and down mountains and across searing basins, the cars closely resembled that sparkling concept. Key aspects that remain true include the huge wheels, 20 inches in front and 21 inches at the rear, and a signature swooping line that starts just behind each front wheel. The line continues rearward, opening up to intake scoops that supply radiators, one on each side, that cool the midmounted powertrain. The 918 Spyder has removable roof panels, similar to those of past 911 Targa models. The roof's pronounced ""double-bubble"" contours draw straight into a similarly undulant rear cowling. The Geneva car's electric-lime exterior and interior accents survive. And by standing directly in back and staring, as an early critic observed, you can still see the face of Donald Duck. Evolving to meet practical considerations like crashworthiness, the 918 Spyder has grown by six inches, to an overall length of roughly 183 inches. The gasoline engine has expanded, to 4.6 liters (580 horsepower) from the concept car's 3.4 liters. There are three electric motors, one at each front corner and a third integrated with the engine and transmission. A 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission regulates all this might. To lower the car's center of gravity, the transmission has been flipped upside down, placing the weighty gear clusters closer to the road.

One notable change from the concept car is the deletion of exhaust pipes that emerged through the bodywork just ahead of each rear wheel. Hot gases now exit upward through the rear cowl, with the two pipes looking like ship's funnels. ""The temperature problem in back is very challenging,"" a powertrain engineer, Christian Hauck, said. ""We decided to get the heat as soon as possible out of the back."" According to Mr. Walliser, the project is on target to meet its three main goals, which include delivering an evocative design, excelling at hotlaps around the Nurburgring and realizing a fuel economy equivalent of 70 m.p.g. when the car runs in electric mode. (As an E.V., it can go up to 15 miles on power from the 6.8-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery with a top speed of 90 m.p.h.) Glancing through the windshield at the square-crowned fenders and the desert shrubs beyond, I buckled into the passenger seat as Mr. Walliser demonstrated the small knob on the steering wheel used to select the driving mode settings: electric, hybrid, sport and race. He took off forcefully with the car in its electric mode; aside from the lack of a clanging bell, it sounded and felt like an old-fashioned streetcar, grumpily urging us forward. Hybrid mode wakes the gas engine for variable assist between the two systems. Sport mode, with added assistance from the electric drive, knocked off my hat as I shot backward against the headrest. Race-mode acceleration was something else entirely, with all the raucous sounds of a cattle drive compressed into three surf-guitar seconds -- about how long it takes to go from 0 to 60 m.p.h. Abrupt crests and random whoop-de-dos on the park road did not flummox the suspension. But because of the dusty interior and the swarm of cables and electrical boxes, I kept thinking of the 918 Spyder prototype as a kit car instead of the state-of-the-art machine that will cost as much as four Bentley Continental GTs with enough left over to buy a Panamera S. Undoubtedly, this perception will recede as the 918 takes on its final polished form. Putting aside these subjective responses, though, questions linger about Porsche's special sports car. Foremost is the daunting task of finishing development work in less than a year. Both prototypes balked at times, and the gray one was momentarily stilled at the side of the road during one ride-along. The second question is about the necessity of the hybrid electric drive system. Are the benefits really worth the cost and complication?","To road test its new hybrid supercar, Porsche had its engineers drive two 918 Spyders from Denver to San Francisco, including a trip through the Nevada desert to see how the car reacted to the extreme heat.",645081c2-0ea5-55b5-9d71-88e4e275a394,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/10/14/automobiles/14PORS2/14PORS2-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=313&w=600&s=fd23d7b9f1bbdbb2b56baa6afedfb940269d1c9d444bd330d0fd5dabcc8c7d8c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,HOT STUFF The Porsche 918 Spyder hybrid supercar during desert testing in Nevada.,645081c2-0ea5-55b5-9d71-88e4e275a394,N24News/imgs/645081c2-0ea5-55b5-9d71-88e4e275a394.jpg,23
Theater,"Renewing the World (or the Theater, at Least)",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/theater/berlin-theater-reviews.html,"BERLIN -- When a new play from one of Germany's leading avant-garde theatermakers sells out a 2,000-seat venue, you know the world's gone topsy-turvy. Imagine Robert Wilson debuting a show to a full house at Radio City Music Hall! Yet, since October, a huge revue theater in the heart of Berlin, the Friedrichstadt-Palast, has been selling out every night it presents a new work from the acclaimed writer-director Rene Pollesch. (In 2021, Pollesch will become the artistic director of the high-minded Berlin Volksbuhne.) At the cavernous Friedrichstadt-Palast, the show shares the schedule with ""Vivid,"" an over-the-top, Vegas-style extravaganza that is about as far in tone from serious theater as you can get. This irony clearly hasn't been lost on Pollesch, whose play seems to refute ""Vivid's"" sleek, razzle-dazzle aesthetic at every turn, starting with its mouthful of a title. ""Believing in the Possibility of the World's Complete Renewal"" (""Glauben an die Moglichkeit der volligen Erneuerung der Welt"") is a minimalist chamber drama set loose on one of the world's largest stages. Don't expect death-defying acrobatics or rousing musical numbers. It's a mordantly funny monologue about isolation and alienation that fuses personal reminiscences with critiques of capitalism.

As its star, Fabian Hinrichs, pontificates about loneliness, 27 dancers from the ""Vivid"" cast follow him around the stage like dutiful children, imitating Hinrichs's gestures and poses and occasionally breaking into a choreographed number. Wandering the auditorium and stage in a gold bodysuit, the sad, funny figure of Hinrichs, who is billed as co-director, intones his laconic and disjointed soliloquy with consummate theatricality (and often without a microphone). Is this melancholy poetry or tragically chic drivel? Pollesch seems to want it both ways. In addition to the dance troupe, ""Believing in the Possibility"" also recycles staging elements from ""Vivid,"" including a gliding futuristic bridge and trippy laser lights. Such allusions seem intended to send up that vacuous blockbuster, whose non-songs and bizarre sets are periodically enlivened by muscular acrobatics and outlandish costumes. (Think second- or third-rate Cirque du Soleil.) At the same time, there's a note of poignancy to Pollesch's text and Hinrichs's delivery: Against the odds, they make you believe in the sincerity of this undertaking. Local critics have gone gaga for ""Believing in the Possibility,"" and much of the enthusiasm probably is owed to Pollesch's cult status here. But despite Hinrichs's blistering performance and Pollesch's unmistakable prose, the show feels slight, dwarfed less by the Friedrichstadt-Palast's massive stage than by the all the hype. Inviting a serious avant-garde director to work at such a huge commercial venue is both an act of folly and a publicity stunt, and I wonder how much the show's success has had to do with its breathless marketing, which promises the event of the century. The show's initial run has been limited to a dozen performances, but the Friedrichstadt-Palast's website teases that more may be coming in 2021.

""Believing in the Possibility of the World's Complete Renewal"" could also serve as the slogan for Stefan Pucher's production of ""King Lear"" at the Munchner Kammerspiele in Munich. In this new translation by Thomas Melle, Lear's ungrateful daughters are radical feminists calling for the dismantling of the patriarchy by any means necessary. Surprisingly, it works. The production shifts the emphasis away from Lear's madness and focuses on the king's refusal to stand aside after ceding power to the next, female generation. While he clings to his privileges, his heirs set about dismantling those traditional power structures. Regan and Goneril are usually portrayed as scheming, bloodthirsty villains, but here they are guided by noble ideas. Understanding them as feminist crusaders neither cheapens their struggle nor excuses their wickedness. Melle does not go for moral relativism, and he does not exonerate the daughters for their villainy. Despite Melle's deep cuts -- including to the dramatis personae -- the plot is left pretty intact. But there are some unexpected changes, including a much-younger-than-usual Lear (played with abrasive bluster by Thomas Schmauser) and a clever gender-switch for Gloucester (the commanding Wiebke Puls), who chastises the king's rogue daughters at her peril. Another standout is the charming and chameleonlike Samouil Stoyanov, who does double duty as Kent and the Fool. The unnatural cruelty of children to their parents registers with forceful immediacy in this visually vibrant production. Set loose on Nina Peller's pop-glam set (a single-story, rotating house topped by a billboard announcing ""The End""), nine exciting actors from the Kammerspiele's permanent company bring the story to contemporary life, fabulously attired in Annabelle Witt's eclectic costumes.

Another contemporary take on a classic currently at the Kammerspiele is far less successful. In ""Die Rauberinnen"" (""The Robbers""), an all-female deconstruction of Friedrich Schiller's 1781 play, the director Leonie Bohm reduces the five-act melodrama to a plotless 80 minutes. Schiller's memorable characters represent Enlightenment values, but Bohm refuses to treat them as avatars of abstract ideals. Instead, they address the audience in confessional monologues that can be painfully personal, or funny, or both. Throughout the brisk performance, the focus remains on the protagonists' psychological profiles. The direct addresses, developed by Bohm together with her actresses, are lively, and the acting is engaging, but the production meanders despite the energetic performances. These include Julia Riedler's ultracool Karl, the play's hero, who leads a band of honorable robbers in the Bohemian forest, and Gro Swantje Kohlhof, who as Karl's rival, Spiegelberg, ad-libs a lengthy and increasingly manic speech while standing on a seat in the middle of the audience. A massive cumulous cloud dominates the production. Eventually, a storm arrives, dousing the stage in rain for the last 20 minutes. The actresses peel off their clothes and slide around sopping wet wearing next to nothing. Does the rain come to wash away the male-dominated canon of Western culture?","An avant-garde Berlin director has sold out a 2,000-seat venue that usually draws crowds with death-defying acrobatics or rousing musical numbers.",d5ab82b5-6872-50ae-b6fd-7f8697831a25,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/13/arts/13berlintheater01/13berlintheater01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=6a607dd537fb8cd8aee88d5f828b5dff854b8abef60603116e8ce555da1677cb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The cast of ""Believing in the Possibility of the World's Complete Renewal"" at the Friedrichstadt-Palast in Berlin.",d5ab82b5-6872-50ae-b6fd-7f8697831a25,N24News/imgs/d5ab82b5-6872-50ae-b6fd-7f8697831a25.jpg,10
Art & Design,A Museum for K.G.B. Aficionados? Da!,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/arts/design/kgb-spy-museum-new-york.html,"""This is a Bulgarian umbrella; have you heard about this one?"" Agne Urbaityte asked, pointing to a blue umbrella behind a glass case. There was a needle peeking out from the top. ""It's a weapon umbrella,"" she said. ""You press the button here, you see the needle, the needle goes out and shoots a small shot of ricin poison. It's still the most harsh poison in the world ."" Thank goodness this was not the real thing. It was the kind of tool famously used to kill the Bulgarian dissident author Georgi Markov on Waterloo Bridge in 1978, roughly a decade after he defected to the West. Many have speculated since that the K.G.B. was involved .

The museum opens at a time when Russian intelligence services have been at the forefront of both pop culture and current events. ""The Americans,"" the FX show about a married couple who spied for the Soviet Union in Washington, has been a cultural phenomenon. It won a Golden Globe this year for best television drama. (Another popular TV show, ""Homeland,"" has had Russian antagonists .) In a news story that seemed as if it were straight out of ""The Americans,"" in December, Maria Butina, a 30-year-old Russian, pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiring to act as a foreign agent. As part of a deal with prosecutors, she acknowledged that Russian officials were behind her efforts. Last year a former Russian spy was poisoned with a deadly nerve agent in Salisbury, England, drawing international outrage. Prime Minister Theresa May said it was ""highly likely"" that Russia was behind the attack. And a newly released K.G.B. archive has revealed the names of 4,141 Latvians who might have been secret informants for the Soviets.

But this museum, Ms. Urbaityte said, is apolitical. ""It's historical and about technological progress; you cannot erase facts from history,"" she said in an interview, sitting next to her father, Julius Urbaitis , 55. They are the co-curators of the new institution . The Spy Museum is the culmination of three decades worth of collecting by Mr. Urbaitis, he said. He first had an interest in World War II artifacts, but when he acquired a listening device that belonged to Adolf Hitler, he became fascinated with espionage, he said. The family hails from Lithuania , where they founded a museum in 2014 called Atomic Bunker -- which was actually based in an old nuclear bunker.

Some of the objects from Atomic Bunker have migrated to Chelsea. About half of the items in the collection, a combination of original artifacts and copies, are owned by the father-daughter duo. The other half were acquired separately by the curators. Ms. Urbaityte and Mr. Urbaitis do not own the museum, which is private and for-profit. The owners have chosen to remain anonymous . The museum doesn't shy away from depicting the harsh tactics of the K.G.B. Far from it: There are interactive exhibits, like a model of a chair used for interrogations.

""If people want to, we can tie them up,"" Ms. Urbaityte deadpanned. The tour starts with a mock-up of a chief officer's work space. A mannequin wearing a K.G.B. chief officer's uniform is at a desk with a flag of Soviet Russia behind him . To the mannequin's left sits a bronze desk lamp, which, according to the curators, sat in a villa belonging to the former Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. Nearby, Russian propaganda posters cover a wall. One of the oldest items in the space is a switchboard from 1928 . Its operator was almost always recruited by the N.K.V.D., the Russian secret police and a forerunner of the K.G.B., according to a description of the item.

There are also original doors from a K.G.B. prison housed at the back of the museum. The accompanying information reads: ""People who did not take psychologically the interrogation process well were put into soft cells. Then people were given various medications to turn from a politically idealistic person into a vegetable."" Many of the exhibits are dedicated to showing exactly how the K.G.B. carried out business, particularly surveillance. Several glass displays show where K.G.B. agents would embed lenses and bugs: in rings, watches, belt buckles, cuff links, dishes, among other places.

Ms. Urbaityte added that Vitali Baganov, who played the role of Stepan in four episodes of ""The Americans,"" had stopped by the museum recently to offer his support. Mr. Baganov also appeared in ""The Sopranos"" as Valery, the Russian who disappears in one of the show's most famous episodes, ""Pine Barrens."" He recorded a one-minute video on behalf of the budding institution, calling it "" fantastic ."" ""Creates an atmosphere of really unique K.G.B. past,"" Mr. Baganov says. The museum has hired tour guides for the space -- a guided walk-through costs $43.99. But if you want to stroll around yourself, it will cost $25 for adults and $20 for students and people age 65 and up. Children under 6 enter for free. The curators want audiences to get their money's worth: Mr. Urbaitis said he and his daughter want the museum ""to blow their minds.""",The new K.G.B.

Fashion & Style,"Conservative and a Vegan in New York. Wait! You Are, Too?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/fashion/weddings/two-unhip-conservative-vegans-in-new-york-marry.html,"Conservative and a Vegan in New York. Wait! You Are, Too?

Long before Josh Loigman and Ann Porter became lawyers, they got used to defending themselves in the court of public opinion. ""People always tell me I've found the only other person in the world who's a conservative vegan,"" said Ms. Porter, a trusts and estates lawyer at Norton Rose Fulbright in Manhattan. ""It does sort of feel that way.""

Though Mr. Loigman noticed Ms. Porter when they first started classes in fall 2012, Ms. Porter doesn't remember seeing him until January 2013, when both went to hear Bruce Friedrich, an animal welfare proponent, speak to the law school's Student Animal Legal Defense Fund. Ms. Porter introduced herself, not knowing he had a girlfriend. ""After the speaker everyone was sitting around talking,"" said Caroline Gignoux, one of Ms. Porter's law school friends and her companion that night. ""We saw Josh, and I don't know how, but I knew he was vegan. Annie commented to me how buff this guy was. We thought all vegans were really skinny. So we decided that would be our icebreaker. We went over to his table and said, 'How are you so buff?'""

Mr. Loigman, who worked in a gym and did lobbying work for the Humane Society just before enrolling in law school, extolled the benefits of protein powder and weight lifting (and he still does). Then, Ms. Porter said, ""he abruptly got up and said his girlfriend was there to take him to the basketball game."" He left with a secret crush on Ms. Porter. Days later, he was messaging her and Ms. Gignoux on Facebook.

""It became clear as soon as we sat down that they had this intellectual spark,"" Ms. Gignoux said. ""They were talking about animal rights and how they were intertwined with politics. I couldn't contribute anything to the conversation. But Annie is brilliant, and he was totally on her level."" That included politically. ""I thought, he's for sure going to be turned off because I'm conservative,"" said Ms. Porter, who is a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. She is also a descendant of Roger Williams, the founder of Rhode Island, and a distant relative of Daniel Boone, the frontiersman and explorer.

In liberal-leaning Manhattan, Ms. Porter said, her fiscal and social conservatism is challenged regularly. At that first lunch with Mr. Loigman, ""I thought we'd have a debate about it. But he said, 'No, I'm conservative, too,'"" she said. Ms. Porter grew up in Summit, N.J., with her parents, Prudence and Michael Porter, who indulged, reluctantly, her hobby of rescuing animals. By the time she was a teenager she had adopted dogs, cats, snails, frogs, birds and a freshwater clam named Clammy. She announced her vegetarianism around age 7.

Mr. Loigman became a vegan after reading the book ""Diet for a New America"" as a 14-year-old in Ocean, N.J. His mother, Tracy Loigman, was accommodating. His father, Larry, didn't discuss it much, he said. Ms. Porter discussed her passion for animals all the time. Mr. Loigman suspected he could convince her to convert from a vegetarian to vegan, a matter of offloading dairy and eggs from her diet and non-vegan clothes from her wardrobe.

""He sent me this article by Matthew Scully,"" a former speechwriter for George W. Bush, Ms. Porter said. ""The article was about the parallels between being pro-life and veganism."" Ms. Porter, who is against abortion rights, was moved. ""I couldn't believe how inconsistent my belief systems were. I opened the refrigerator and saw milk in there, and I was disgusted,"" she said. Her conversion happened right then. Her status as Mr. Loigman's girlfriend, though, was taking its time to develop. It was not until the beginning of their second year of law school that Mr. Loigman sent what they now affectionately call ""the Scully article,"" originally printed in National Review. (""We are a couple with a William F. Buckley Jr., obsession,"" Mr. Loigman said of the late conservative pundit who founded that magazine.) And though their friendship was well established by then and both were single, Mr. Loigman's initial romantic overture was inviting Ms. Porter to a sports bar to watch a football game. Dinner, at halftime, was veggie Subway sandwiches.

He intended to present the ring on Sept. 8, but Ms. Porter woke up a little before midnight on Sept. 7 while Mr. Loigman was setting the scene, complete with a custom-made board game about their relationship, to propose. He regrouped, recited the Aristotle quote, ""Friendship is a single soul dwelling in two bodies,"" and asked Ms. Porter to be his wife. Ms. Porter, through what she called ""hysterical tears,"" said yes. On July 7, before 100 guests at Mohonk Mountain House in New Paltz, N.Y., Mr. Loigman, in a black Kenneth Cole tuxedo, and Ms. Porter, in a Galia Lahav mermaid dress with dramatic train and vintage Tiffany earrings borrowed from her mother, met in a grassy garden under brilliant sunshine and an arch woven with ranunculus and roses. The Rev. Anthony Mizzi-Gili Jr., a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony, as a 10-person wedding party, most showing their solidarity with the vegan couple by wearing no silk, leather or wool, looked on. At a reception in an outdoor pavilion, the usual choice of chicken or fish was replaced with vegan options: rice noodles with coconut green curry, tomato basil risotto and tofu with Japanese sweet potato. Though many of the relatives who had criticized them in their youth for forgoing meat were in attendance, no one complained. In fact, Cheryl Rajewski, a Porter family friend who is lifelong meat-eater and chef, was fantasizing about the curry during cocktail hour. ""I know it's going to be delicious,"" she said. ""I can't wait.""","The couple met at a Student Animal Legal Defense Fund, but soon realized they had more in common than a conviction that eating meat is immoral.",460973c4-d500-5b00-a718-725a254bf121,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/22/fashion/weddings/22VOWS1/22VOWS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=a74c23a24d2418eb35402f83437af5fbeb4bbc0b47634a302b32f13a9b7f778c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ann Porter and Josh Loigman were married July 7 at Mohonk Mountain House in New Paltz, N.Y.",460973c4-d500-5b00-a718-725a254bf121,N24News/imgs/460973c4-d500-5b00-a718-725a254bf121.jpg,19
Global Business,Spanish Companies Look Abroad for Growth,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/15/business/global/spanish-companies-look-abroad-for-growth.html,"MADRID -- With Spain struggling to escape the European debt crisis and facing the threat of another recession, cash-strapped companies in the country are increasingly looking abroad for new business and financing -- and losing their Spanish accent in the process. While it is hardly a corporate exodus, the fear that the trickle will become a flood if the Spanish economy worsens is generating concern at a time when the government in Madrid is struggling to find additional revenue to close a gaping budget deficit. Highlighting concerns about Spain on Thursday, Standard & Poor's downgraded the country's long-term debt rating, to AA- from AA, because of its poor growth prospects and troubled banks. Telefonica, the former public telephone monopoly, set off alarms in September when it said that it would create a new digital unit in London for its most promising mobile and online businesses.

The news came shortly after it announced major layoffs in Spain, where unemployment is already higher than 20 percent. Other companies are taking smaller steps, like using foreign subsidiaries to circumvent punitive borrowing costs at home. At the same time, some multinationals, like the two biggest Spanish banks, Santander and BBVA, are playing down their nationality to reassure international investors as they seek to expand their business outside the country. The value of Spain as a corporate brand has become ""a lot worse,"" said Pablo Vazquez, an economist at the Fundacion de Estudios de Economia Aplicada, a research institute in Madrid. The effect is felt not only in falling earnings, he said, but also ""in terms of the intangible benefits that the Spanish brand transmitted before, those of a dynamic and youthful European society."" Avoiding an exodus should be a priority of the next government, following a general election on Nov. 20, he added. Company executives have been reluctant to discuss publicly their concerns about being in Spain, particularly before the election.

Telefonica insisted that the decision to shift the digital unit, which includes its popular social network Tuenti, should not be viewed as an abandonment of Spain, even though the reorganization also involved folding its Spanish unit into a broader European business. Guillermo Ansaldo, a Telefonica executive, said at a conference a day after the relocation announcement that the group would continue to invest heavily in Spain, after spending EUR24.5 billion, or nearly $34 billion at the current exchange rate, in the country over the past decade. Still, since the onset of the financial crisis, the proportion of Telefonica's investments in Spain has fallen to 24.5 percent of its global capital investments in the past financial year, from 27.6 percent in the 2007 financial year. In a surprising U-turn, the fashion retailing giant Inditex announced last month that it would move the online sales subsidiary of Zara, its flagship brand, back to Spain from Ireland. It made that statement shortly after reports in the Spanish news media highlighting the tax savings that the Zara unit had made in Ireland. Inditex, however, is among the few Spanish companies to have been relatively unscathed in the financial crisis.

""Spanish companies are really getting hit very hard in terms of their ability to issue shares and raise financing in general,"" Mr. Ghemawat said. ""It might not boost the market capitalization immediately, but it does make sense to shift assets to safer jurisdictions, should things really get more sour here."" But given the public outcry that any full-fledged departure could generate, Mauro Guillen, a Spanish professor of international management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said that companies were instead likely to use ""lots of intermediary solutions."" A company that followed Telefonica's lead would be likely to benefit, since ""being based in London would give them more favorable access to financing,"" said Luis Garicano, a professor at the London School of Economics. Abertis, an infrastructure group, took a different direction. Last March it issued EUR750 million in bonds through its French subsidiary. The deal allowed Abertis to benefit from the stronger credit rating of its French unit, which is rated AAA+ by Standard & Poor's, compared with BB+ for the parent company. That gap is in line with higher operating margins for the French business. Whatever happens to Spain, almost every Spanish multinational has set ambitious targets to derive more earnings from outside the country. For instance, Francisco Gonzalez, the chairman of BBVA, has said that Spain should ultimately account for only 10 percent of its profit, compared with 31 percent in the second quarter, as growth in emerging markets has continued to outpace that of the Spanish franchise. BBVA also recently moved its bond trading activities to London from Madrid. To reassure international investors, big Spanish companies have also been highlighting their decreasing reliance on their home market.

For example, Santander recently ran an advertising campaign in international media outlets with the slogan ""A strong global brand,"" underlining its diversification and the small portion, just 12 percent, of first-half profit that came from its Spanish consumer banking business. Crisis-stricken Portugal represented only 2 percent. ""None of our biggest clients is now asking us to highlight Spain as part of their advertising strategy -- quite the opposite,"" said a director at a leading advertising company, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of client confidentiality issues. Aside from Latin America, Britain has arguably become the main target of Spanish companies abroad. Most of that investment occurred during the boom years before the financial crisis, notably the 2004 acquisition of the mortgage lender Abbey National by Santander and the 2006 takeover of BAA, the British airport operator, by Ferrovial. But it has started to pick up again, according to Justine Winterburn, senior investment adviser at the British Embassy in Madrid. ""As a result of the economic downturn, we are experiencing a rise in the number of companies interested in the U.K. market,"" she said, with 2012 expected to show a further increase. Britain welcomed 56 new Spanish investment projects in the past financial year, up 47 percent from a year earlier, according to U.K. Trade & Investment, a government agency. The latest Spanish investments in Britain generated 3,542 jobs there, an increase of 116 percent over the previous year. That is good news for Britain but infuriating for Spanish labor unions. Still, Fernando Casado, director of the Business Council for Competitiveness, a lobbying association formed in February that represents the largest companies in Spain, said that it was unrealistic to expect multinationals to stay put in the current economic environment. ""The goal of the big companies must be to invest outside and then lift others in their wake,"" Mr. Casado said. ""The reality is that the prospects for making a strong investment here today are low. But if you're successful outside, you will also create a very positive chain reaction and lift suppliers here.""",Businesses are escaping a stagnant economy at home and raising concern in a country with big sovereign debt and a high jobless rate.,2af3d386-b678-5922-98a3-4429bfa9989e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/10/15/business/Spainbiz/Spainbiz-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=357&w=600&s=07851a254898b566e9c2b790666d2df1ae982f94890d3207781201a45f91dd2b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,A government employment office in Madrid.
