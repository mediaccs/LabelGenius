Food,Green Dreams,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/dining/green-dreams.html,"Sam Sifton emails readers of Cooking five days a week to talk about food and suggest recipes. That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. Greetings! It's Melissa Clark here, taking the newsletter's reins from Kim Severson, who took them from Sam Sifton, who is somewhere in Australia, hopefully eating Witchetty grubs so he can report back to us. (Apparently, they taste like scrambled eggs.) I've also been traveling this week, and just got back from a quick jaunt to the Bay Area, where I ate my weight in morning buns, signed some cookbooks and reported some stories. And I had a chance to revel in all the spring produce that's about to hit the rest of the country (depending on where you're reading this).

In San Francisco, they already have the local artichokes, peas, and fava beans that we New Yorkers can only dream about until June (when we can finally make this gloriously vernal pasta). As one lucky San Franciscan whispered as we meandered through the farmers' market, ""We've had asparagus for so many weeks we're starting to get sick of it."" Alas, not me. It's most definitely still on the menu at our house, where I just might make asparagus pesto and slather it over some thinly sliced baguette if I'm too lazy to boil pasta. That is, if I were going to follow a recipe for dinner. But being that it's Wednesday, our no-recipe recipe day, I might instead riff on a dish of zucchini agrodolce with peas made by my good friend the food photographer Eric Wolfinger. (Check out this video of him shooting a cookbook.) This is what I'd do: Slice a couple of zucchinis, drizzle them with olive oil and broil until crisp. While that cooks, blanch some peas if you've got fresh ones, or let some good frozen ones defrost. Boil a few tablespoons of vinegar and an equal measure of sugar or honey, add a pinch of red pepper flakes, and let it simmer until the whole thing is syrupy and reduced by half. Toss the hot zucchini with your peas and the agrodolce. Drizzle with loads of olive oil and crumble in some goat cheese. Serve with crusty bread, and that's all you need for a light, satisfying dinner.","Melissa Clark is in for Sam, and she's got produce on the brain and a no-recipe recipe for zucchini agrodolce with peas.",bd12a237-33b2-5f6e-939a-d493ea6b1fda,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/04/24/science/24recipehealth/24recipehealth-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=15ed30066cfe04c3271b6c364f8527cb2b3cad86e5a38158005ddf849eea3eb4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Farfalle with artichokes, peas, favas and onions.",bd12a237-33b2-5f6e-939a-d493ea6b1fda,N24News/imgs/bd12a237-33b2-5f6e-939a-d493ea6b1fda.jpg,17
Food,"That Summer Grilling Standard, Buttery Flank Steak",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/dining/flank-steak-recipe.html,"There are steak lovers who extol the melt-in-your-mouth tenderness of a lean filet mignon. Others adore devouring the charred fat of a properly marbled strip steak. A lean cut from the muscular abdomen of the cow, it requires some active chewing. But what flank steak lacks in softness, it makes up for with a deeply mineral brawniness that can stand up to the spiciest, tangiest, most pungent marinades. It's the cut to cook when you want as much beefy character as possible, and are willing to chomp a little to get there.

The great thing about a flank steak is that you can marinate it in pretty much anything that tastes good, and the meat will soak those flavors right up. I've used everything from leftover salad dressings to the last bits of salsa, and it always comes out fine. Be bold in your seasonings, a flank steak can take it.

Here, I balance tangy, funky Worcestershire sauce with herbs, garlic and jalapeno, rounded out with a bit of brown or coconut palm sugar to help the meat caramelize. Then I use those same flavors, along with lemon zest for brightness, in a compound butter that's sliced on top of the steak. As it softens, the butter mingles with the steak juices, melting into a rich, creamy puddle. To augment the sauce, I char a few ripe tomatoes until their skins blister. Chopped up with basil and scallions, they add sweetness and brightness to the buttery, meaty mix.

If you have time to marinate your steak the day before, you should. It gives the meat the most time to absorb all the seasonings. But even a couple of hours makes a huge difference. Then heat your grill or broiler as hot as it can go. I like cooking flank steak until it's seared and mahogany brown on the surface but still ruby-hued and rare inside. Medium-rare is good, too, but don't be tempted to push it any more or the beef will dry out. (Well-done fans should consider another, more forgiving cut.)","Flavor the brawny, beefy cut with tangy Worcestershire sauce, garlic and herbs, and top it with charred ripe tomatoes.",bf36e8ad-f59a-560f-80ef-051318edf53f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/26/dining/21appe1/21appe1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=d12b2788024b05458e67da6b66f0b0abe483c1bf77e64d0f8da7e2a66bd5430f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Lean flank steak stands up to a Worcestershire-spiked marinade in this recipe.,bf36e8ad-f59a-560f-80ef-051318edf53f,N24News/imgs/bf36e8ad-f59a-560f-80ef-051318edf53f.jpg,17
Theater,'Dear Evan Hansen' Names Replacements for Ben Platt,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/theater/dear-evan-hansen-names-replacements-for-ben-platt.html,"""Evan is such a complex and rewarding role, and I can't wait to see Noah and Taylor make it their own,"" Michael Greif, the show's director, said Tuesday in a statement.

Automobiles,A Wee Taste of Europe: Will Americans Bite?,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/automobiles/autoreviews/12fiesta.html,"THERE are two types of small cars in America. First, there are the bare-bones, price-is-the-entire-object ennui-boxes. These are the cars you end up driving when you stubbornly resist the $2-a-day upgrade at the rental counter. A few years back, Chevrolet of Canada caught flak for running an ad for the Cavalier that basically said, ""Hey, it's better than taking the bus."" The pitch offended bus riders and public transportation advocates, but I admire that honesty. Cars that duke it out at the very bottom of the market  like the basest Nissan Versa or Hyundai Accent, each priced around $10,000  promise mobility, and that's about it. It took a long time for car companies to realize that drivers in the United States might consider a small vehicle that wasn't ruthlessly built to a price. The modern Mini Cooper was the trailblazer, proving that Americans might buy a diminutive hatchback on its own merits, even when they could afford something bigger. Cars like the Mini and the Honda Fit offer a more upscale driving experience than the frill-free automotive flounders that scour the bottom of the market for rental sales, college students and frugal commuters. The Ford Fiesta is a subcompact in the ambitious Fit idiom. It's not the least expensive small car you can buy (or even, perhaps, the least expensive Ford). But the 2011 Fiesta hews to the European hatchback ideal, and Europeans hold the bizarre expectation that small vehicles should act like real cars.

First, a bit of history on the nameplate: in the late 1970s and early '80s, Ford sold a hatchback called the Fiesta. In the late '80s, it introduced a hatchback named the Festiva. Now we're back to the Fiesta. I asked Ford what the rationale was behind the Fiesta-to-Festiva-to-Fiesta name change, and the response was, ""The Festiva was a different car."" Right. One which happened to be the smallest Ford hatchback, just like the car it replaced. It's as if Ford canceled the Mustang, replaced it with a V-8 muscle car named the Mutsvang, and then declared that the two vehicles had nothing to do with each other. And I'm afraid that's the best answer I have for you on that. This Fiesta is a far cry from the bygone Korean-built Festiva, which came with 12-inch steel wheels suggesting that somewhere, a lawn tractor was up on blocks. Ford's new baby is available as a sedan or five-door hatchback and offers upmarket equipment like a 6-speed dual-clutch sequential transmission, heated leather seats and the excellent Sync multimedia system.

Rear drums aside, the Fiesta is about as safe as it gets in this class. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety named the Fiesta the first minicar to earn the designation of Top Safety Pick. (The distinction applies to Fiestas built after July, when Ford strengthened the door handles.) Regardless of the build date, the Fiesta interior has enough air bags to raise the Edmund Fitzgerald. And electronic stability control is standard. There is one engine, a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder that squeezes out an indifferent 120 horsepower. So the Fiesta is slow. Then again, so are its competitors. But you should not drive alongside rivers near college campuses, because you might get passed by varsity crew teams. The Fiesta's best talent is making you forget its size once you're actually moving down the road. The body is so stiff and quiet that I kept finding myself speeding, despite the modest power. The suspension quietly soaks up impacts while maintaining a controlled ride  there's none of the Clydesdale clop you hear when the engineers try to dial a soft ride into an overly flexible chassis. You get a sense that the limits are low but that the car doesn't mind frolicking on an on-ramp now and then. Mainly, though, the Fiesta seems optimized for the role it will probably fill for most people: commuting. There's very little wind noise, you have Sync to handle your smartphone and play podcasts, and the fuel economy is excellent  40 miles per gallon on the highway, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. When you do need to gas up, Ford's capless filler is one of those small delights that makes life a little easier.

The Fiesta is really the exemplar of the domestic hatchback's newfound respectability. But the main challenge for small cars in America is that there's not much financial incentive to buy them. In Europe and Japan, driving a smaller car brings tax advantages. Then there's the cost of fuel, which is currently more than $6 a gallon in most of Europe. When every mile per gallon and gram of carbon dioxide counts on the bottom line, it makes sense to buy the smallest car that will get you to work on time. And to that end, the Fiesta is a hit. It's Ford's No. 1 seller in Europe, with half a million sold in the last year. But in the United States, unless your car is subject to the gas-guzzler penalty, the taxman doesn't care whether you have a 1.6-liter 4 or a 550-horsepower V-8. So the financial rationale for entry-level cars mostly amounts to what you save on the purchase price, relative to the next car up the ladder. And for Ford, there's precious little breathing room between the Fiesta and its bigger sibling, the Focus. The Fiesta starts at $13,995 for a basic sedan with a 5-speed manual transmission and can cost more than $21,000 for a loaded five-door SES. A couple of months ago, I grabbed a Ford dealership flier that advertised the 2011 Fiesta SE for $16,895. The same dealership was hawking the 2010 Focus SEL, with a leather interior, for $15,495. The Focus concedes a few m.p.g.  its highway mileage is in the mid-30s  but it offers more passenger room and 20 extra horsepower. The Fiesta is technologically superior, but will buyers care about a dual-clutch gearbox when they can get more car for less money in the same dealership? I know I'm comparing leftover Focuses with 2011 Fiestas, but even once the Focus is redesigned, there will never be much daylight between these two cars.","The Ford Fiesta hatchback hews to the European ideal, which holds that small vehicles should act like real cars.",8a1c0f05-157d-5e5b-8cf4-273e7bbd12b7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/12/automobiles/WHEE-1/WHEE-1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=291&w=600&s=3f03909249828b1dece529a05849939d7b75f413dca7cbf978a95ce696309b7a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"SMALLVILLE The Fiesta minicar, already Ford's best seller in Europe, is offered in the United States as a hatchback, above, or sedan.",8a1c0f05-157d-5e5b-8cf4-273e7bbd12b7,N24News/imgs/8a1c0f05-157d-5e5b-8cf4-273e7bbd12b7.jpg,23
Television,Turner Classic Movies' First Black Host on Keeping Old Films Alive,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/09/arts/television/jacqueline-stewart-tcm.html,"This year, the cable channel Turner Classic Movies celebrated its 25th anniversary as the home where movie lovers can indulge in cinematic nostalgia. In some ways the network has kept many facets the same -- all movie presentations remain commercial-free, for one, and fans continue to look forward to programming staples such as Summer Under the Stars (daylong marathons spotlighting movie stars) and ""TCM Remembers"" (an end-of-year in memoriam montage). But TCM has not been resistant to change over the years, and on Monday, it announced a historic one: Beginning Sunday, the film historian and preservationist Jacqueline Stewart will step in to introduce the long-running weekly programming series Silent Sunday Nights. While in the past prominent figures such as Ava DuVernay and Spike Lee have served as guest programmers, Stewart will be the network's first black host. (From 2016 to 2018, Tiffany Vazquez appeared on TCM as the channel's first woman and person of color to host.) Stewart, a professor at the University of Chicago specializing in black cinema and silent film history, might already be a familiar name (and face) to some hard-core TCM enthusiasts: In 2016 she appeared alongside the longtime host Ben Mankiewicz to introduce the companion series to ""Pioneers of African-American Cinema,"" a box set of short and feature films from the early 20th century that she helped curate. She was also a panelist at the TCM Film Festival in 2018 and 2019. During a recent phone conversation, Stewart discussed film preservation in the age of streaming and how she plans to bring her expertise to her new role. These are edited excerpts from that conversation.

So much is happening in terms of film distribution and streaming services -- Filmstruck was short-lived, and films can seemingly disappear from any platform at any time. In what ways do you see your own work in film research and preservation playing into your job as a host on TCM? A huge percentage of silent films and classic Hollywood films, the nitrate film stock is so unstable. It is incredibly important to show its worth. What we have has to be kept in the best physical condition, no question. But we also have to do work to preserve these films in our consciousness, and that happens through screening and presenting them. So for the last few years, I've been very fortunate to have spaces across the South Side of Chicago where I have done film screenings. I have a series now where we showcase films that are by and about women and people of color. And the presentation of film, the giving people a space -- not just to watch them, but then to have a dialogue about them afterward -- is incredibly important to me. And I see that as a real connector between the scholarship that I do. I did a course a couple of years ago, a seminar. I taught it with Miriam Petty, who is [a professor] at Northwestern University now, about ""Birth of a Nation,"" to mark the 100th anniversary of that important and problematic film. And we made a number of the screenings public -- we realized, people really need a space to talk about some of these films that are difficult to talk about. They need a space to talk about ""Gone With the Wind"" or some of the Shirley Temple and Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson films. Having the opportunity to present films on TCM, for me, is just this really powerful extension of that work -- creating platforms for people to watch films and to have dialogue about them.

I've been talking with the TCM team a lot about using this as a space to really show the diversity of filmmaking during the silent period. This is a period when a huge percentage of the filmmakers were women, and yet this is a history that I think viewers may not be aware of. There were women directors and writers in huge numbers who were contributing to the development of the medium. And many of the women who appear onscreen, some of the actors, were not just taking instruction from male filmmakers; they were co-creators of their stories and their images. For example, one of the first things that I'm going to be presenting is the film ""Cleopatra"" from 1912: It's one of the very first feature-length films made in the United States, just three years before ""The Birth of a Nation."" And it was made by Helen Gardner Picture Players; Helen Gardner was an actress and she's the first actor, male or female, to create her own production company. She was really committed to elevating film to the level of a high art during a period when people still felt that film was just a low-class business, not an art form. She wanted to bring stories and bring production values that would get people to recognize that there was real beauty and dynamism in filmmaking. Moving forward, we'll feature films by women, some pioneers like Lois Weber or Alice Guy-Blache. Based on your previous collaborations with TCM, what is your impression of the network's audience in general, and how is that informing how you will discuss these films? This is a knowledgeable audience. Having the opportunity to interact with TCM viewers at the festivals, they're a really passionate group of viewers, no question. But they are also viewers who are really interested in learning more about the films that they care about.

I was part of a panel at this year's festival that was on the complicated legacy of ""Gone With the Wind."" And I guess I thought we might have to be a little bit mindful of the fact that people love this film, and may not want to hear a lot of criticism of the film, even though it should be obvious to everyone now that the film presents a romantic vision of slavery, which was very popular at the time. But when we were doing the panel, what I saw was that the TCM viewers there really wanted to delve into these issues, and they wanted to understand what Hattie McDaniel' s experience was like making this film. And they were very interested to know more about how African-American audiences and critics responded to the films, and what the film meant for the future possibilities for black talent in Hollywood. I think the audience is really familiar with this history and looking to complicate it and to learn more. What I say to my students all the time is that it's not a matter of rejecting these films or you know, refusing to engage with films that have content that we find to be problematic. We can't do that. In fact, the responsible thing to do -- and I think the rewarding thing to do -- is to really delve into their complexities and to look at them as mirrors of their time, but also as mirrors to us today.","With the addition of Jacqueline Stewart to its roster, the old movie network makes a notable hire.",0d4a4037-99ee-5e68-abde-4bfcad394bc5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/10/arts/09tcmhost/09tcmhost-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=1305f75c2d570c7e96d32cddb19148880aa859475c452e187eead6ca6d59a7ad&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jacqueline Stewart, a film archivist and professor at the University of Chicago, will be the first black host at Turner Classic Movies.",0d4a4037-99ee-5e68-abde-4bfcad394bc5,N24News/imgs/0d4a4037-99ee-5e68-abde-4bfcad394bc5.jpg,3

How would a person act if he or she had been raised outside of society? The question has been considered in works like the Austrian playwright Peter Handke's drama ""Kaspar,"" about a 19th-century German who claimed to have grown up without any human contact, and ""Captain Fantastic,"" the 2016 feature that cast Viggo Mortensen as a father who lived with his children in the woods. But ""Hanna,"" a 2011 thriller, asked it with a fresh angle: what if someone were raised outside of society -- to be a meticulous killer? The movie cast Saoirse Ronan in the role of Hanna, a teenager whose father trained her in the wilderness to be an assassin. This new adaptation, created and written by David Farr (a writer of the original movie), puts a new spin on the tale, with Hanna (now played by Esme Creed-Miles) hunting and being hunted by a C.I.A. agent (Mireille Enos).

Opinion,Our Leader's Life Is at Risk. Cue the Conspiracy Theories.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/opinion/trump-covid-conspiracy-theories.html,"Richard Lawrence attempting to assassinate President Andrew Jackson at the Capitol in 1835. Lawrence's pistol misfired and he was tackled to the ground.

The conspiratorial speculations swirling around Donald Trump's illness were inevitable. I'm not saying that just because the White House's mixed signals and lack of transparency have made it difficult to know what's going on, though that hasn't helped. Nor am I blaming social media, which may be a conduit for these rumors but did not cause them. Any time a president faces a life-threatening incident, conspiracy theories follow, even without a big information gap or credibility vacuum to fill. When Andrew Jackson survived an assassination attempt in 1835, for example, pro-Jackson newspapers -- and the president himself, in an impolitic moment -- accused Senator George Poindexter, Democrat of Mississippi, of plotting the murder. As Jacksonian congressmen convened an investigation, some of Jackson's critics retorted that the whole incident might have been a false flag, with the president hiring the gunman to gain public sympathy. The first two presidents to actually die in office were William Henry Harrison and Zachary Taylor. Both were felled by illness, but rumors spread that each had died at the hands of a wicked cabal. When Abraham Lincoln was elected, several supporters wrote him to warn against the plotters.

""General Harrison lived but a short time after he was installed in office,"" one letter declared, and ""General Taylor lived but a short time after he took his seat."" It continued, ""You, sir, be careful at the king's table what meat and drink you take."" Another reported that ""I have often heard it stated by physicians, that it was an undoubted fact, that our two last Whig presidents, Generals Harrison and Taylor, came to their sudden and lamentable ends by subtle poisons."" Those purported plots featured prominently in John Smith Dye's ""The Adder's Den,"" an 1864 conspiracy tract that treated both deaths -- and the assault on Jackson, too -- as parts of a ""Parallax View"" -style series of covert ops by Southern slaveholders. This wasn't seen as a fringe position: The book was excerpted in The Chicago Tribune, and The New York Times ran a respectful notice that told curious readers they should ""get this pamphlet and read it for themselves."" Nor did such notions disappear after the Civil War. During the effort to impeach President Andrew Johnson, Representative James Mitchell Ashley, an Ohio Republican, declared that both Harrison and Taylor had been ""poisoned for the express purpose of putting the vice presidents in the presidential office."" By that time America had another dead president. Lincoln's death immediately set off talk of conspiracies larger than that of John Wilkes Booth and his confederates, and Dye produced a new edition of his book blaming the same vast Southern conspiracy for Booth's bullets. Over the years, more Lincoln theories would emerge, attributing the murder to everyone from the vice president to the Vatican. The next president killed in office was James Garfield, shot in 1881 by a disgruntled job-seeker named Charles Guiteau. The rumor mill quickly claimed the deed had been arranged by the Republican Party's ""Stalwart"" faction, whose members included Vice President Chester Alan Arthur. (One newspaper, The Baltimore American, was agnostic about whether Guiteau had acted alone, but it called the killing a coup ""whether the assassin had accomplices or not."")

Next was William McKinley, assassinated in 1901 by Leon Czolgosz. Czolgosz was a self-described anarchist, so the police promptly rounded up anarchists in jurisdictions around the country to interrogate them. On Sept. 11, five days after the shooting, the New York newspaper The World asserted that the Buffalo police had uncovered evidence of a ""great anarchist plot."" (A day later, in a follow-up article, Buffalo's police chief called the accounts ""pure fakes."") After Warren Harding fell ill and died in 1923, a story spread that the first lady had poisoned the philandering president. In ""The 103rd Ballot,"" his classic account of the 1924 Democratic convention, Robert K. Murray mentions a more outre idea: Some anti-Catholic cranks attributed Harding's death to ""hypnotic waves generated by the minds of Jesuit telepaths."" Franklin Roosevelt's death inspired another assortment of theories. One tract, first published in 1948, suggested that a Communist waiter had served Roosevelt ""an Oriental poison handed down from the days of Genghis Khan."" In a twist, the book claimed that this crime took place at the Tehran Conference of 1943, that Roosevelt was either dead or incompetent soon after he returned to America, that an actor then played him in public, and that this double was the man who died in 1945. That was, admittedly, not a popular belief. But the fears that followed the 1963 slaying of John F. Kennedy were downright mainstream. At their peak, in 1983, an ABC News poll found 80 percent of Americans considered it more likely than not that there was a conspiracy to kill Kennedy.

When Gerald Ford survived a pair of murder attempts in 1975, stories circulated that Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, or perhaps a group of Navy brainwashers, had pulled the strings of the would-be assassins, one of whom was the Charles Manson acolyte Squeaky Fromme. The future president Ronald Reagan played footsie with a different idea: At a 1979 meal with the columnist Jack Germond, Germond recalled, ""Reagan suddenly brought up the two assassination attempts against Ford. The timing of these episodes, particularly the second, he said, was just a little bit suspicious. Ford had been the beneficiary of 'the sympathy vote' because of Squeaky Fromme, and he, Reagan, had always wondered about whether it might have been arranged for political purposes.""

Reagan himself survived a shooting two years later. His vice president, George H.W. Bush, happened to have some ties to the gunman's family, and conspiracists have been chewing on those connections ever since. When a powerful man has a fatal or near-fatal experience, people are bound to speculate no matter what -- conspiracies about the powerful are a durable phenomenon in American politics, circumstances aside. But such speculations will flourish more in some social contexts than others. There was a lot more public theorizing about Jackson's brush with death than Ford's or Reagan's, for reasons ranging from the reactions of the president to the more intense partisanship of the 1830s press. In Mr. Trump's case, his illness is part of a pandemic that has turned American society upside down -- and epidemics themselves are machines for generating conspiracy rumors. That's a potentially potent combination. And it's one we've seen before. In 1857, there was a lethal outbreak of dysentery at the National Hotel in Washington; three congressmen died, and President-elect James Buchanan became sick. Naturally, conspiracy theories exploded. Some Southerners imagined an abolitionist plot. John Smith Dye, casting his suspicions in the opposite direction, proposed a rather Rube Goldbergish scheme in which Southern agents poisoned the hotel's supply of lump sugar. Southerners drink coffee, Dye postulated, and coffee drinkers use granulated sugar; so the Southern diners would be spared and the tea-sipping Northerners killed. One writer painted an even more paranoid portrait of weaponized disease, and not just at the National Hotel. An 1868 article in The New-York Tribune claimed that Washington had once been ""free of malaria -- that is, for Democrats; but when the new Republican Party began to gain strength, and it was possible that they might become the ruling power in Congress, the water of Washington suddenly grew dangerous, the hotels (particularly the National) became pest houses, and dozens of heretics from the Democratic faith grew sick almost unto death."" More recently -- that is, last week -- a former Republican congressional candidate in California, DeAnna Lorraine, declared it ""odd"" that ""no prominent Democrats have had the virus but the list of Republicans goes on and on."" This is not actually odd, because it is not actually true. But you can't say the idea is unprecedented.

The actor Jussie Smollett, facing charges of falsely reporting a hate crime in Chicago, was delivered an unexpected win on Tuesday when the Cook County state's attorney dropped all 16 counts against him.

Both Stephen Colbert and James Corden drew a parallel between this and another bit of recent news: Attorney General William P. Barr's interpretation of a report filed by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, investigating collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.

Health,"CMV Is a Greater Threat to Infants Than Zika, but Far Less Often Discussed",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/health/cmv-cytomegalovirus-pregnancy.html,"Three-year-old Evelyn Steadman of Crete, Ill., was born with the CMV virus and has microcephaly and deafness.

CMV Is a Greater Threat to Infants Than Zika, but Far Less Often Discussed

Laura Sweet had no idea that she had contracted a virus that would leave her daughter, Jane, deaf by her first birthday. During her second pregnancy, doctors had warned her against alcohol and changing kitty litter. They had said to avoid sushi and cold cuts. But nobody -- not her obstetrician, nor her midwife -- mentioned cytomegalovirus. Only after a frustrating search lasting months did doctors discover that the girl had been infected in utero. The infection and the emotional ordeal that followed, she thinks, could have been prevented -- for the Sweet family and thousands of others every year. ""It's tough to play the what-if game,"" said Ms. Sweet, 37, a consultant for an education nonprofit in Cumberland, Me. ""You can drive yourself crazy with that.""

The world has been galvanized by the Zika epidemic spreading through the Americas, which has left more than 2,000 infants with severe brain damage. But for pregnant women and their infants in the United States, cytomegalovirus, or CMV, is the far greater viral threat. Every year, 20,000 to 40,000 infants are born with CMV. At least 20 percent -- up to 8,000 -- have or develop permanent disabilities, such as hearing loss, microcephaly, intellectual deficits and vision abnormalities. There is no vaccine or standard treatment. But there are now hints that some newborns may benefit from antiviral drugs, a finding that has reinvigorated the debate over whether they should be routinely screened for the infection. CMV is the most common congenital viral infection and the leading nongenetic cause of deafness in children. Roughly 400 children die from it annually. By contrast, roughly 900 pregnant women in the continental United States have contracted the Zika virus.

CMV should be every bit as urgent a priority as Zika, he argues. Health officials called for a vaccine decades ago, and there still isn't one, partly because of a lack of public awareness about CMV, Dr. Schleiss said. CMV is a hardy member of the herpes family, and it is transmitted by contact with saliva and urine -- often from diaper-wearing children to adults. Pregnant women often get it from toddlers, especially those in day care who share drool-drenched toys. ""Toddlers are hot zones for CMV,"" said Dr. Gail Demmler-Harrison, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. It is difficult for mothers to protect themselves from a virus carried by the children they care for. Nearly one in three children is infected by age 5, and more than half of adults by 40. CMV takes up permanent residence in the body and can cause illness again after being dormant. Like the Zika virus, it causes mild flulike symptoms, or none -- but can be devastating to a fetus. Had she known any of that while pregnant, Ms. Sweet might have reduced her chances of contracting CMV with diligent hand-washing, especially after diaper changes, and not sharing utensils or food with her son, Henry, then 2 and in day care. ""If there was awareness about CMV, at least women working in day care and women with toddlers could potentially modify some behavior,"" Ms. Sweet said.

Rebekah McGill, a speech language pathologist in Greeneville, Tenn., gave birth to a stillborn daughter, Elise, at almost 39 weeks, later discovering that CMV was the likely reason. Ms. McGill was inconsolable -- and angry that she had never been warned about the virus during any of her four pregnancies. ""Sometimes, I wonder if our daughter would still be alive if I had only known,"" she said. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists used to encourage counseling for pregnant women on how to avoid CMV. But last year, the college reversed course, saying, ""Patient instruction remains unproven as a method to reduce the risk of congenital CMV infection."" Some experts argue that because there is no vaccine or proven treatment, there is no point in worrying expecting women about the virus. Instead, Dr. Christopher Zahn, the vice president for practice at ACOG, said doctors must focus on conditions with proven interventions and let patients dictate the discussion. ""There are so many topics to cover during pregnancy that this is often driven by what patients are most worried about,"" he said.

But pregnant women don't worry about CMV only because they don't know about it, some researchers say. They argue that it is high time to carry out education campaigns and infant screening for the infection, arguing that it smacks of paternalism to do otherwise. Dr. Demmler-Harrison, the infectious disease specialist, said she was ""livid"" about ACOG's decision. ""I am baffled why obstetricians do not feel it is important or even worthy to educate pregnant women about CMV,"" she said. ""It's a missed opportunity to save a baby from the devastating effects of CMV, including death in the womb and permanent disabilities."" A study in a French hospital found five to 10 minutes of counseling about CMV prevention resulted in fewer women contracting the virus. In another study, pregnant mothers shown a video and offered hygiene tips were much less likely to get CMV (5.9 percent) than those not given information on prevention (41.7 percent). ""It's as if doctors are saying, 'I'm going to cherry-pick what you know and you don't know,'"" said Erica Steadman, 30, a digital marketing manager in Crete, Ill., who says her obstetricians never mentioned the virus.

Guidelines from ACOG suggest that pregnant women will find CMV prevention ""impractical and burdensome,"" especially if they are told not to kiss their toddlers on the mouth -- a possible route of transmission. But Kim Hill, a mother of four in Raleigh, N.C., did not find it that hard. Her second daughter, Kaitlyn, now 7, was born with signs of CMV infection and became hearing-impaired. So when she became pregnant with twins, Ms. Hill stopped sharing food with her kids and regularly scrubbed her hands. ""People canceled trips and rearranged their whole lives not to travel to Zika areas,"" Mrs. Hill said. ""All we are saying is, wash your hands.""

In most states, babies are not universally screened at birth for CMV infection, on the grounds that most won't be injured by the virus and clinicians don't want to worry parents unnecessarily. The consequences of infection are often not detected until months or years after delivery. ""A common scenario is a child is born who looks completely normal, and who may or may not pass the newborn hearing screening, and then as they age, at 6 months or 12 months or older, hearing becomes an issue,"" said Dr. Albert H. Park, the chief of pediatric otolaryngology at the University of Utah. Now some experts are pushing for routine screening of newborns for CMV. The idea is to identify those who are infected in the first 21 days so that they can be given regular hearing tests, an eye test, a magnetic resonance imaging test of the brain, and perhaps antiviral treatment.

The screening question has taken on much greater importance with a recent discovery. A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine last year found that infants with CMV symptoms at birth who took an antiviral drug for six months had moderately better hearing at 2 years, compared with newborns who took it for six weeks. The six-month group also performed better on a test intended to assess cognitive, communication and motor skills. The finding suggests that the roughly 10 percent of babies born with multiple symptoms of CMV infection, like brain abnormalities and hearing loss, could benefit from antiviral drugs. The finding does not apply to infected infants without symptoms at birth, experts noted, and it's not yet known whether antiviral medication is safe and effective in babies whose only symptom is hearing loss. In Maine, Jane Sweet, almost 2, now wears cochlear implants. Because of early-intervention services like physical therapy, she walked at 16 months. Still, it's not clear what the future holds. CMV infection left abnormalities in Jane's brain, which may presage developmental troubles. ""We won't know until she's in school if she has learning delays,"" Ms. Sweet said.","Every year in the U.S., 20,000 to 40,000 infants are born with cytomegalovirus. Yet most doctors don't talk with pregnant women about how to prevent it.",c7b4ff17-a568-542c-b432-3dd372a86ca2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/22/science/25CMV4/25CMV4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=3bb1624972430966b85887531025ba4ec399a56a546f601cc5f532bd12e6b68c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Laura Sweet of Cumberland, Me., with her daughter Jane, 2, who was readjusting the connection to her cochlear implant.",c7b4ff17-a568-542c-b432-3dd372a86ca2,N24News/imgs/c7b4ff17-a568-542c-b432-3dd372a86ca2.jpg,1
Travel,Theme Park Dining Beyond Burgers and Turkey Legs,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/travel/theme-parks-food-dollywood-universal.html,"The bad reputation of theme park food has been, let's face it, pretty well deserved: All the negative aspects you might find at a state fair -- sugary, greasy and overpriced -- minus any of the quirky homespun charm. Mass-produced and joylessly prone to corporate tie-ins, it's the ultimate iteration of the theme park's overriding mission: to separate you from every last dollar in your pocket. But there's good news on theme park menus. While the old standbys are still standing by, there's been a shift recently toward food that's actually, well, edible. Your old favorites are still there: funnel cakes, cotton candy, turkey legs. But there are some decent restaurants now, too, some of which border on the downright respectable. I sampled a bit of everything on an impulsive three-park tour that included Knott's Berry Farm and Universal Studios in Southern California, as well as Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tenn. Here are some rides worth sending your taste buds on.

We'll start with the bad news: Many of the vendors at Knott's sell rehashed variations of the same combinations -- burger, hot dog, chicken sandwich, fries -- despite having enticing names or being situated in different themed areas in the park. For example: I ordered a Western BBQ bacon burger ($8.79 a la carte, $15.99 in a combo with fries and drink) at Sutter's Fine Family Fare in Ghost Town. It had an unappetizingly stringy texture, and didn't make up for that in flavor. So I moved on, walking through Camp Snoopy over to the Grizzly Creek Lodge. It was a nice space with a large dining room, and I was excited. But the menu was almost identical: burger, hot dog, chicken sandwich. As was the menu at Coasters Diner. At Boardwalk Barbecue there wasn't a barbecue item anywhere on the menu. No matter where I went, it was just the same burger, hot dog and chicken sandwich. (To be fair, sometimes there's a pizza, and sometimes chicken tenders. But it's all more or less the same menu.)

It wasn't all bad -- I had some good carne asada nachos ($10.59) from Cantina in Fiesta Village. The guacamole that topped them was flavorless, but the meat was great. It was hot and tender and had a peppery quality almost like jerky. I also managed to find some actual barbecue at Fireman's Brigade Barbecue. Despite the disgruntled employee manning the grill who was cursing sotto voce while cooking the ribs, turkey, corn and garlic toast that I ordered, the food was decent. The giant turkey leg ($10.29), in particular, was the best I sampled at all three parks if only because it was the only example that wasn't overwhelmingly salty. The good news is that Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restaurant, which closed last year for renovations, is open again, and it's well worth your time. The best part? You don't even have to pay for park admission ($47 online, by far the cheapest of the parks I visited) to go; the restaurant is right outside the gates of the park. Service is good (I sat at the bar), and the decor is appealing, if trying a little too hard: wooden tables, lighting fixtures made with old ladders and Mason jars. Let's call it ""modern barn.""

Maybe, as a local, she had become slightly immune to its charms. But I found the 150-acre park pretty delightful. Dollywood, founded in 1961 as Rebel Railroad, has a very light, ""Up With People"" kind of vibe. The music is bouncy and cheerful, and the employees positively exude classic Southern charm, down to the parking lot tram driver, who called out after us, ""I hope you make memories worth repeating, and I hope you love every moment."" I don't know about memories worth repeating, but I definitely found food worth re-eating. Dollywood excels, as one might expect, in traditional Southern fare. The wonderfully titled Granny Ogle's Ham & Beans is named after the grandmother of one of Dolly Parton's close friends. I ordered the Fronie's Sampler for $15.99, which came with pot roast, pulled ham, mashed potatoes, turnip greens and a blackberry cobbler. The meats were very good -- not overcooked but still very tender in their own juices.

The ribs ($18.99) were solid but unspectacular -- a bit dry, and the Coca-Cola marinade gave them a confusing sweetness. The fried green tomatoes ($6.99) were better: generous slices perfectly fried in a cornmeal batter (which was a bit thick for my taste, but I picked some of it off). The banana pudding made me feel like an 8-year-old back at my babysitter's house -- sweet, creamy pudding with big chunks of banana, mixed with crumbled up Nilla wafers and topped with Cool Whip. I noticed the name tag of my nice waitress read ""Koke."" ""My mama named me after a Coca-Cola bottle,"" she said. ""And when she went down to the courthouse, she spelled my dang name wrong!"" Other areas where Dollywood really shone were with the casual finger foods. The funnel cake ($6.99) was the best of the three parks I visited -- crispy on the outside, hot and moist on the inside, with a generous dusting of powdered sugar. The cinnamon bread ($5.99) from a place called the Grist Mill was a loaf of sloppy decadence. About the size of my two fists together (an incredible bargain, by the way), the loaf, fresh out of the oven, almost burned my hands through the paper bag I received it in. The hot bread, dripping with a syrupy butter mixture, had a nice savory component to it as well, balancing out the sweetness.

Let's cut to the chase: At Universal, it's all about the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, which opened last year to epic lines and mobs of robe-wearing, wand-wielding fans. It accomplishes an ambitious goal: to make you feel as if you've been transported to another place. The buildings are beautifully designed; the shops are carefully done with great attention paid to detail. A woman selling small stuffed animals called Pygmy Puffs rang a bell when a little girl bought one. ""Attention everyone,"" the employee said. ""Casey here is adopting a Pygmy Puff, and he's going to a wonderful home. Can I get a round of applause?"" People clapped, and the little girl positively beamed. Three Broomsticks is the main place to get grub, and it's really the only one worth your time -- and that applies to the entire park. (Exception: There are a couple of decent places in the ""Simpsons""-themed area, including some very respectable $8.99 carnitas tacos from the Bumblebee Man's Taco Truck.) I was again impressed with the decor: old lanterns and caldrons abound. (Members of the staff are all dressed like Dobby the house elf, though -- I wasn't sure how I felt about that.) My dining companion and I made a couple of friends in line and decided to order the Great Feast for four people ($54.99). It was one of the best dining bargains of any of the three parks I visited, and I would go so far as to say that it's objectively a good value -- in or out of a theme park. You get an enormous fresh salad with Italian dressing that is easily enough food for six people. That's followed by the main event, a gargantuan tray of food brought out by one of the cooks. ""Here's the Great Feast,"" she said, smiling, ""magically prepared for you guys."" I asked her, ""Do they make you say that?"" She smiled even bigger. ""Yes, they do!""

On the tray were four big ears of corn, a mountain of roasted red potatoes with grilled onions, four slabs of ribs, a big roasted chicken and various steamed vegetables. The undercooked veggies were the only thing that was underwhelming. Everything else was excellent. The ribs were moist and juicy, the meat coming effortlessly off the bone. The roasted chicken was also tender, and flavored nicely with pepper, lemon and garlic. The potatoes were soft and savory, dripping with butter. The accompanying drinks were almost as good as the food itself: Butterbeer, the drink made famous in the novels, is creamy and indulgent. It's essentially cream soda topped with a thick layer of ""foam"" that resembles melted ice cream. The pumpkin juice is also tasty -- refreshing and not overly sweet, it's like a nice spiced apple juice. ""Wow,"" said our new friends, Amy and Kyle, through mouthfuls of chicken and ribs. ""This is pretty impressive."" The kitchen staff may not actually be able to work magic. But with the respectable, decently priced fare they're churning out, they just might fool you for a second.","At three theme parks — Knott's Berry Farm, Universal Studios and Dollywood — it takes some work to find good food. But it exists.",d51920f3-9f67-5c8a-942f-7c43ade83c32,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/19/travel/19FOOD6/19FOOD6-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=9923b524eaa54e8dc29888b07cd51ce122984b588950be0e42a9485169322849&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Fireman's Brigade Barbecue at Knott's Berry Farm.,d51920f3-9f67-5c8a-942f-7c43ade83c32,N24News/imgs/d51920f3-9f67-5c8a-942f-7c43ade83c32.jpg,4
Opinion,Decoupling From China: There's Precedent,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/13/opinion/letters/china-trade.html,"Re ""The U.S. Shouldn't Try to Out-China China"" (Op-Ed, Sept. 3):

I take issue with Jessica Chen Weiss and Ali Wyn when they say Australia, India and Japan don't want to decouple from China to the same extent as the United States. In fact, Japan has already established a government-funded program to subsidize Japanese companies for moving factories from China back to Japan.

India has already taken more restrictive measures in barring Chinese companies and Chinese apps from its market than the United States has done. Australia has joined with Japan and India in a combined effort to reroute supply chains away from excessive dependence on China.

In fact, these countries have already decoupled from China at least as much and perhaps more than the United States.

Technology,"AnchorFree, Maker of a Top Online Privacy App, Raises $295 Million",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/technology/anchorfree-vpn-hotspot-shield.html,"Despite the recent attention on digital privacy, venture capital investors have mostly stayed away from companies that offer virtual private networks, which allow users to hide their online tracks. Now there is one big exception. AnchorFree, the maker of Hotspot Shield, one of the oldest VPN apps, said Wednesday that it had raised $295 million. The round brings AnchorFree's total funding to $358 million, far outpacing any of its competitors. The company, based in Redwood City, Calif., is the latest tech start-up to secure a giant investment. Fund-raising rounds of over $100 million have become more commonplace than ever this year. The investment in AnchorFree suggests that the VPN category is becoming more mainstream. Investors previously avoided it in part because relatively few users have adopted the technology. In addition, some of the networks are not as secure as their companies claim.

But after events like the Equifax hack, the repeal of net neutrality rules and Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal, downloads of Hotspot Shield spiked. It's a little perplexing, since a VPN would not have protected people affected by any of those events. David Gorodyansky, the founder and chief executive of AnchorFree, said they had pushed typical consumers to take privacy and security more seriously. Hotspot Shield has been downloaded 650 million times. Lately, it has averaged 250,000 downloads a day. For most of the summer, it has been the top-grossing app in its category in the Apple App Store, and in the top 50 over all, according to the app-ranking site App Annie. AnchorFree's other apps, Betternet and HexaTech, ranked high on the App Store charts this week, as well as competing VPN apps owned by Norton, McAfee and a variety of obscure companies. ""Two years ago, there were no privacy or security apps in the top 100,"" Mr. Gorodyansky said. ""There's been a massive shift.""

AnchorFree made for an attractive venture investment because the technology it has built on top of the open-sourced VPN software makes it faster than other VPN services, said Sujay Jaswa, a partner at WndrCo, the investment firm that led the latest round of financing. Many of AnchorFree's competitors license its technology, including Bitdefender, Dashlane, Kaspersky and McAfee. AnchorFree's tech is also prevalent in smartphones and the products of telecommunications companies. Samsung Galaxy phones come loaded with AnchorFree's VPN software; Verizon and Telefonica license it as well. The companies split revenue earned from anyone who becomes a paying customer. The company said it has been profitable since 2010. It has just 110 employees; 80 are engineers, and it has no salespeople. Hotspot Shield is free, but a small percentage of users pay a monthly fee for extra features, including faster internet speeds, the ability choose their internet server, and added protection from phishing, malware and spam. The company recently added a product specifically for businesses. In 2017, the Center for Democracy and Technology, a nonprofit that promotes digital rights, asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate AnchorFree and Hotspot Shield, accusing the company of deceptively redirecting users to certain websites and sharing data.","The investment suggests that Hotspot Shield and other virtual private networks, or VPNs, are becoming more mainstream.",e5e624e6-477e-5366-851a-277b1ab0ea4c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/06/business/06anchorfree1/06anchorfree1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=3783a5b06d0e05d8af713d16dadc7619106a04e60d0d9721f9dab2d25f35a592&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""Two years ago, there were no privacy or security apps in the top 100,"" David Gorodyansky, the founder of AnchorFree, said.

Technology,Facebook Says It Won't Back Down From Allowing Lies in Political Ads,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/technology/facebook-political-ads-lies.html,"The stance put Facebook, the most important digital platform for political ads, at odds with some of the other large tech companies, which have begun to put new limits on political ads. Facebook's decision, telegraphed in recent months by executives, is likely to harden criticism of the company heading into this year's presidential election.

Political advertising cuts to the heart of Facebook's outsize role in society, and the company has found itself squeezed between liberal critics, who want it to do a better job of policing its various social media platforms, and conservatives, who say their views are being unfairly muzzled. The issue has raised important questions regarding how heavy a hand technology companies like Facebook -- which also owns Instagram and the messaging app WhatsApp -- and Google should exert when deciding what types of political content they will and will not permit. By maintaining a status quo, Facebook executives are essentially saying they are doing the best they can without government guidance and see little benefit to the company or the public in changing. In a blog post, a company official echoed Facebook's earlier calls for lawmakers to set firm rules. ""In the absence of regulation, Facebook and other companies are left to design their own policies,"" Rob Leathern, Facebook's director of product management overseeing the advertising integrity division, said in the post. ""We have based ours on the principle that people should be able to hear from those who wish to lead them, warts and all, and that what they say should be scrutinized and debated in public."" Other social media companies have decided otherwise, and some had hoped Facebook would quietly follow their lead. In late October, Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, banned all political advertising from his network, citing the challenges that novel digital systems present to civic discourse. Google quickly followed suit with limits on political ads across some of its properties, though narrower in scope.

Reaction to Facebook's policy broke down largely along party lines. The Trump campaign, which has been highly critical of any attempts by technology companies to regulate political advertising and has already spent more than $27 million on the platform, largely supported Facebook's decision not to interfere in targeting ads or to set fact-checking standards. ""Our ads are always accurate so it's good that Facebook won't limit political messages because it encourages more Americans to be involved in the process,"" said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign. ""This is much better than the approaches from Twitter and Google, which will lead to voter suppression."" Democratic presidential candidates and outside groups decried the decision. ""Facebook is paying for its own glowing fake news coverage, so it's not surprising they're standing their ground on letting political figures lie to you,"" Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Twitter. Ms. Warren, who has been among the most critical of Facebook and regularly calls for major tech companies to be broken up, reiterated her stance that the social media company should face tougher policies. The Biden campaign was similarly critical. The campaign has confronted Facebook over an ad run by President Trump's campaign that attacked Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s record on Ukraine. ""Donald Trump's campaign can (and will) still lie in political ads,"" Bill Russo, the deputy communications director for Mr. Biden, said in a statement. ""Facebook can (and will) still profit off it. Today's announcement is more window dressing around their decision to allow paid misinformation."" But many Democratic groups willing to criticize Facebook had to walk a fine line; they have pushed for more regulation when it comes to fact-checking political ads, but they have been adamantly opposed to any changes to the ad-targeting features.

On Thursday, some Democratic outside groups welcomed Facebook's decision not to limit microtargeting, but still thought the policy fell short. ""These changes read to us mostly as a cover for not making the change that is most vital: ensuring politicians are not allowed to use Facebook as a tool to lie to and manipulate voters,"" said Madeline Kriger, who oversees digital ad buying at Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC. Other groups, however, said Facebook had been more thoughtful about political ads than its industry peers. ""Facebook opted against limiting ad targeting, because doing so would have unnecessarily restricted a valuable tool that campaigns of all sizes rely on for fund-raising, registering voters, building crowds and organizing volunteers,"" said Tara McGowan, chief executive of Acronym, a nonprofit group that works on voter organization and progressive causes. Facebook has played down the business opportunity in political ads, saying the vast majority of its revenue came from commercial, not political, ads. But lawmakers have noted that Facebook ads could be a focal point of Mr. Trump's campaign as well as those of top Democrats. Facebook's hands-off ad policy has already allowed for misleading advertisements. In October, a Facebook ad from the Trump campaign made false accusations about Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. The ad quickly went viral and was viewed by millions. After the Biden campaign asked Facebook to take down the ad, the company refused. ""Our approach is grounded in Facebook's fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is,"" Facebook's head of global elections policy, Katie Harbath, wrote in the letter to the Biden campaign.

In an attempt to provoke Facebook, Ms. Warren's presidential campaign ran an ad falsely claiming that the company's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, was backing the re-election of Mr. Trump. Facebook did not take the ad down. Criticism seemed to stiffen Mr. Zuckerberg's resolve. Company officials said he and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's president, had ultimately made the decision to stand firm. In a strongly worded speech at Georgetown University in October, Mr. Zuckerberg said he believed in the power of unfettered speech, including in paid advertising, and did not want to be in the position to police what politicians could and could not say to constituents. Facebook's users, he said, should be allowed to make those decisions for themselves. ""People having the power to express themselves at scale is a new kind of force in the world -- a Fifth Estate alongside the other power structures of society,"" he said. Facebook officials have repeatedly said significant changes to its rules for political or issue ads could harm the ability of smaller, less well-funded organizations to raise money and organize across the network. Instead of overhauling its policies, Facebook has made small tweaks. Mr. Leathern said Facebook would add greater transparency features to its library of political advertising in the coming months, a resource for journalists and outside researchers to scrutinize the types of ads run by the campaigns. Facebook also will add a feature that allows users to see fewer campaign and political issue ads in their news feeds, something the company has said many users have requested.","The company was under intense pressure to adjust its policies. But in this presidential election year, no big changes are planned.",aa35842d-c2d6-5f49-8fea-0a17255995d5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/10/business/09JPfacebook-print/09facebook-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=4e6faf725bd24c6ccfcb44239903a41c8eddf5ba5bb484b8de8b1eb9712b78fc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Facebook had been under pressure to change its hands-off rules for political ads.,aa35842d-c2d6-5f49-8fea-0a17255995d5,N24News/imgs/aa35842d-c2d6-5f49-8fea-0a17255995d5.jpg,20
Food,"From Wild Blueberries and Maine Terroir, Fine Sparkling Wine",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/dining/drinks/blueberry-wine-maine.html,"Eric Martin, left, and Michael Terrien, in a field of wild blueberries in Maine. They are now making sparkling wine from wild blueberries.





APPLETON, Me. -- Unless you have trained eyes, you could drive the narrow roads winding through the heart of coastal Maine's wild-blueberry country and never realize you were surrounded by acres of blueberry vines. They slither along close to the ground, the narrow leaves as green as grass. A field of wild- blueberry vines resembles nothing so much as a vast lawn. If you visit in late July as the berries near peak ripeness, you may spy a glint of blue here and there. Look closely, and troves of berries begin to reveal themselves, nearer to lavender than blue, and tinier than the more familiar plump high-bush berry that makes up most of the country's blueberry crop. Wild blueberries are Maine's bounty, the official state berry and a staple of roadside farm stands in the late summer. They are nutritious, tart, piquant and subtly complex. But there are problems: Because of competition, climate change and low commodity prices, farmers are not making enough money to sustain their businesses.

This situation has been more than disturbing to Michael Terrien, a California winemaker who lives in the city of Napa with his wife, Hannah Henry, and four children. Mr. Terrien's connection to wild blueberries is deep. He grew up in Cape Elizabeth, Me., just southeast of Portland, not far from blueberry territory, a narrow band that stretches northeast along the coast from southern Maine through far eastern Canada. Mr. Terrien, 51, has been making wine in Northern California for more than 20 years, with experience at Acacia and Hanzell. Now he makes lively chardonnays and pinot noirs under his own label, Terrien, as well as perfumed pinot noirs from the Santa Cruz Mountains under the U.S. Grant label, and a variety of wines at Obsidian Ridge Vineyard in Lake County.

For the last five years, Mr. Terrien and Ms. Henry, along with Mr. Terrien's childhood friend Eric Martin, and Mr. Martin's wife, Meredith McMonigle, have been making Bluet, a sparkling wine of wild blueberries with nothing added but yeast for fermentation. They make two styles: One, in tiny amounts, is made using the same method as Champagne, producing first a still wine and then refermenting it in a bottle to produce bubbles. The other, made in larger quantities, is produced like most Proseccos, carbonated in bulk in a pressurized tank. Bluet's most recent version of the Prosecco-style wine, bottled with a screw cap, smelled like violets, roses and, yes, blueberries. It was exuberant yet dry and savory, and, at 7 percent alcohol, deliciously easy to drink. The bottle-fermented wine, packaged like Champagne in a cork-topped bottle, is more contemplative. The 2017 was deeper, subtler, lightly savory and quietly complex. It, too, was about 7 percent alcohol, near the upper limit for blueberry wines. The two bottles made me wonder, why has this never been done before? For as long as humans have cultivated fruit, they have made some form of fruit wine. Fermentation is really just another form of preservation, after all, creating a tasty and intoxicating alternative to jams, pickles and other sometimes desperate efforts to conserve every last bit of summer's abundance.

Grapes, it happens, have the perfect ratio of sugar to acid, along with other elements that over time have come to represent the ideal source of table wine. Apples and pears can make wonderful cider, which is really another name for wine. Take another step and distill the wines, and you have an entirely different set of distinctive preserved fruits in the form of brandy, eau de vie, slivovitz and so on. Beautiful beverages have been made from cranberries, loganberries, blackberries and even Douglas fir buds. Blueberries? Other efforts I've tasted have been cloying and syrupy, better for pancakes than for drinking. It was one such experience that indirectly led to Bluet (pronounced the Maine way, BLUE-ett). Mr. Terrien and Mr. Martin were attending a bachelor party in Maine in the late 1990s, and were served a blueberry wine. ""It was so sweet, we couldn't drink it,"" Mr. Martin recalled. ""Michael said there had to be a way to make better blueberry wine than this."" Though called wild blueberries, the fruit is cultivated. Farmers sell primarily to big processors who freeze the berries and sell them for industrial uses, like blueberry-muffin mix. Unlike the high-bush berries, which have been bred and modified to enhance particular traits, wild blueberries have not been altered. The notion of blueberry wine arose again after Mr. Terrien and Ms. Henry were married in 2000 in a barn belonging to Mr. Terrien's aunt and uncle in Jefferson, Me., just a few miles southwest of Appleton. Everything for the reception -- the lobsters, the vegetables, the desserts -- had come from Maine, except the wine, because there were no good Maine wines.

""It was the missing piece, and one of the first times we thought seriously about it,"" Mr. Terrien said. It took a while for the project to coalesce. Mr. Martin, a novelist who also works in nonprofit organizations, lives in Durham, N.C. Each summer, the families would converge in Maine, and during these interludes they would experiment with wild-blueberry beverages. ""Playing around confirmed we could make something we would like to drink,"" Mr. Terrien said. Why sparkling wine? I tasted a still blueberry wine from the 2018 vintage destined to be refermented in bottles. It smelled of blueberries and was dry, but something was missing.

This deficiency might cause a producer to add sugar, as in sweet commercial fruit wines, or to doctor a mediocre chardonnay with oak flavors. But Mr. Terrien was determined to make a wine that expressed the spirit of the fruit and the place. ""The purity of this fruit, growing in this place 10,000 years since the glaciers receded, has more right to be turned into wine than pinot noir,"" he said. ""It's a cultural dance between fruit and people. It's been here forever, and people have done nothing with it!"" He thought of Champagne, which, before the climate began to warm, was made in a marginal environment where the grapes would barely ripen most years. A still Champagne, decades ago, might have tasted thin and dull.

""In order to make it good, it needed bubbles,"" Mr. Terrien said of the blueberry wine. ""Just like Champagne, it needed the bubbles to make an otherwise lower alcohol, meager wine complete."" In 2014, they made their first batch, 50 cases' worth, in the same barn where Mr. Terrien had been married. It sold out quickly, entirely in the Portland area. Working without a template, they made mistakes. At first, the bubbly wine had a tendency to erupt from the bottle when opened. Early on, Mr. Terrien believed that the berries, with thin skins and barely discernible seeds, needed something to provide additional structure, so he included leaves in the fermentation. They added a distinct herbal flavor, which was not unpleasant but perhaps not optimal. The learning curve has been quick, and each year, the wine has gotten better. They've moved out of the barn and into their own unit in an industrial park in Scarborough, Me. Perhaps more important has been building relationships with blueberry growers, like Linda and Cary Nash in Appleton, who farm about 600 acres but last year did not harvest some plots because the price they were paid was too low.

Mr. Terrien said the growers need to get 50 cents a pound to break even. Bluet is offering 70 cents a pound, three times what the processors were willing to pay in 2018. This ray of hope has attracted the attention of the state of Maine , which, in its effort to preserve agricultural traditions, has given Bluet grants and loans. The company plans to buy 40 tons of fruit in 2019, a significant increase from the 22 tons it bought last year, to make about 36,000 bottles. About 90 percent of that will be the simpler wine, to be sold primarily in Maine, with a little in New York, Massachusetts and California, and the rest will be the Champagne style, sold only in Maine. Consumers in many states can also buy directly from Bluet's website. Mr. Terrien knows this is just a trickle. For the farming business to turn around, and for wild- blueberry wine to prosper, he said, an entire industry would have to develop, both to build a wine economy and to gain a better understanding of the terroir of wild blueberries. ""It's this iconic fruit of Maine, and we know there's a cipher, a geography, that's written into it,"" he said. ""It's got to make something that speaks of this place.""","It began as a lark among childhood friends, one a California winemaker. It has become a cultural exploration and, maybe, hope for an ailing industry.",961ea5ab-e486-5ce3-8e9f-0b0c728c8b4e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/21/dining/15pour04/15pour04-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=788d4095f7487c2fd42bfacc3048568d56c3d4d31269a6b597b0a65fc26540aa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Bottles of sparkling wild blueberry wine, made using the same method as Champagne.",961ea5ab-e486-5ce3-8e9f-0b0c728c8b4e,N24News/imgs/961ea5ab-e486-5ce3-8e9f-0b0c728c8b4e.jpg,17
Economy,U.S. Economy Cooled as G.D.P. Grew at 2.6% Rate in Fourth Quarter,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/business/economy/gdp-report.html,"The American economy slowed at the end of 2018 -- and there could be a further slowdown to come. Gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the United States -- grew at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the final three months of last year, the Commerce Department said Thursday. That marks a significant slowdown from the middle of the year, when a sugar high fueled by tax cuts and government spending increases briefly pushed growth above 4 percent. This year seems to be starting at an even slower pace. Many economists expect growth to drop below 2 percent in the first quarter, in part because of the partial government shutdown, which began in December and extended through most of January. It's important to keep the cooling economy in perspective. The fourth-quarter slowdown wasn't as severe as many forecasters had feared, and even with the loss of momentum late in the year, 2018 as a whole was among the best years of the decade-long recovery from the Great Recession. And most economists do not expect a recession this year, putting the current expansion on track to become the longest on record. ""I think this is a slowing,"" said Lewis Alexander , chief United States economist for Nomura. ""I don't think this is 'we're falling into an abyss.'""

Thursday's report did give President Trump some bragging rights -- albeit with an asterisk. Economic output rose 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. That's a politically salient benchmark because Mr. Trump and his advisers have repeatedly promised growth of 3 percent or better, something his predecessor never achieved over a full calendar year. (Mr. Trump has at other times promised growth of 4 percent or more.) ""A year of 3.1 percent growth is something many people thought was impossible as recently as 2016, so it's a major accomplishment,"" said Kevin Hassett, chairman of Mr. Trump's Council of Economic Advisers. ""And it's an accomplishment that has disproportionately benefited low-wage and blue-collar workers."" Still, Mr. Trump didn't quite score a clear victory. By another commonly used method of calculating annual growth -- which looks at G.D.P. over full years, not just comparing the fourth quarter of each year -- the economy fell just short of that mark, coming in at 2.9 percent. Whether growth hits 3 percent might matter politically, but it makes little difference economically. The difference between 2.9 percent and 3 percent growth is negligible in any one year, and, in any case, the Commerce Department will revise its fourth-quarter estimate in March.

The fourth-quarter slowdown wasn't as bad as some forecasters had expected. Consumer spending, the bedrock of the economy, rose at a 2.6 percent rate -- slower than in the middle of the year, but hardly a collapse. Exports, which slumped in the third quarter, rebounded in the fourth, suggesting that the cooling global economy isn't yet dragging down American exporters. And businesses stepped up their investment in equipment, software and research, a sign that they are still betting on the future.

* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Still, uncertainty about the direction of the economy has made some businesses more cautious. George Whittier , who oversees operations for the Morey Corporation, a manufacturer outside Chicago, said business was strong in 2018 but began to slow at the end of the year. He shrugged off weakness in December as a seasonal blip. But then January was softer, and February was softer still. Morey, which makes electronic components for cars, medical devices and other uses, has been hit by Mr. Trump's tariffs, which raised prices on imported parts from China. At first, the impact was small, but it has grown as suppliers draw down inventories and are forced to import more. ""As each month has gone by, it has seemed like more and more components have been affected,"" Mr. Whittier said. For now, Mr. Whittier remains optimistic that the trade tensions will be resolved and 2019 will prove to be a good year. But he is taking a wait-and-see approach when it comes to making big investments. Thursday's report left little doubt that the midyear surge in growth has dissipated, just as many economists predicted at the time. Tax cuts and federal spending increases provided a temporary lift, but that was offset by higher interest rates, trade tensions and a slowing global economy. And the effects of the stimulus will fade further in 2019.

Residential investment, a proxy for housing construction, fell for the fourth straight quarter, as higher interest rates and declining affordability weighed on construction and sales. Retail sales dropped unexpectedly in December, which could be a sign that consumers are starting to pull back. And growth in the fourth quarter was driven in part by companies building up inventories, which could reverse in 2019. ""On the one hand, I was encouraged that there wasn't as much of a slowing as I thought,"" said Ben Herzon, an economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm. ""But on the other hand, what propped up growth in the fourth quarter was unsustainable."" The government shutdown came too late to make much difference to the fourth quarter, but it could be a significant drag on growth early in the year. The funding lapse idled hundreds of thousands of federal workers, left hundreds of thousands more working without pay and disrupted air travel, among other effects. Consumer confidence plummeted. Macroeconomic Advisers on Thursday cut its estimate of growth in the current quarter to 1.1 percent. Growth that weak would leave the United States with little buffer against an unexpected round of bad news -- an escalation in the trade war with China, for example, or another round of fiscal gamesmanship around the debt ceiling. A rising share of economists expect a recession in 2020 if not sooner. ""The economy's already slowing and there are a bunch of reasons why it could slow down even more, and that just makes you vulnerable,"" said Mr. Alexander of Nomura. ""It would take less of a shock to push you over the edge"" into a recession. Is there reason for optimism? Not everyone is so pessimistic. Most economists believe the shutdown did little long-term damage to the economy. Consumer confidence rebounded in February as federal workers returned to work and the stock market bounced back from its December slump. Job growth never suffered. ""The fears of the economic expansion's demise seem to have been greatly exaggerated,"" said Beth Ann Bovino , chief United States economist for Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. She called Thursday's report promising, and said it suggested the economy entered 2019 on firmer footing than some economists had feared.",The pace slowed from midyear after losing the momentum generated by tax cuts.,585477d0-a8af-5a85-83c3-1d62ad0d102b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/01/business/01jpecon1-print/28econ3-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=4e6281604f3f9d462a118eb0d72e4aae3253ab83278d175a82bdf18090cedf4d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A residential development in Southern California.

Books,Oprah's Book Club Dropped Her Novel. It Still Became a Best Seller.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/books/review/my-dark-vanessa-kate-elizabeth-russell.html,"MY DARK DEBUT Kate Elizabeth Russell worked on her first novel for 18 years -- through high school, college, a master's program, while earning a Ph.D. in creative writing from the University of Kansas and beyond. It took ""about five months of constant querying"" to find an agent, but then William Morrow quickly snapped up the manuscript for an impressive sum in 2018. Rights were sold in 27 countries. ""My Dark Vanessa,"" which explores a sexual relationship between a 15-year-old student and her teacher through a #MeToo lens, was hailed as one of the most anticipated books of 2020.

It appeared that the most difficult stretch of Russell's road to publication was behind her. It wasn't. In January 2020, a fellow author accused Russell of plagiarism. The allegation appears to be unfounded but Oprah's Book Club -- leery of the controversy surrounding the publication of ""American Dirt"" -- dropped ""My Dark Vanessa"" as a selection. Then coronavirus hit. Russell's March 10 publication date happened to coincide with the cancellation of the Tucson Festival of Books, classes at Harvard and elsewhere, and St. Patrick's Day parades from Boston to Dublin. The worst was yet to come.

Nevertheless, ""My Dark Vanessa"" became an instant best seller, debuting at No. 6 on the hardcover fiction list and holding its own for three weeks. And Russell is surprisingly sanguine about the ""surreal"" and circuitous journey that has brought her to this place. She says, ""There was no 20-city tour that was canceled. I don't really enjoy being the center of attention, so we were just going to see how the book did and take it slowly."" It turns out, conducting author events via Instagram Live has been enjoyable for this self-proclaimed homebody: ""You see the people watching, and they leave comments in real time. You get the sense of something happening in the moment. It feels comfortable to me, and I think a lot of other writers would probably say the same.""

Like many of us, Russell is having trouble concentrating right now, so she isn't writing as much as she'd like. But she is reading ""in spurts"" when she isn't checking for coronavirus updates. She says, ""One book I'm about halfway through is a novel coming out in August. It's called 'Talking Animals,' by Joni Murphy, imagining New York City populated by animals. The protagonist is an alpaca. It's this amazing capitalist critique that feels very reassuring, depicting a world already turned upside down.""",Kate Elizabeth Russell's publication experience has been the best of times and the worst of times.

Automobiles,"Far From the Factory, Adding Final Touches",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/automobiles/far-from-the-factory-adding-final-touches.html,"TO travelers landing at Newark Liberty International Airport, the vast asphalt fields of vehicles on the ground below look like so many livestock pens. Staged in these open-air waiting rooms are thousands of cars and trucks that will shortly be hauled to dealerships up and down the Eastern Seaboard. What can't be seen from the air are the dockside finishing schools that apply the final touches to half a million vehicles that pass through each year. Here as at other seaports, dedicated facilities owned by individual automakers, as well as giant multibrand processing centers, shepherd autos arriving from overseas and ready them for buyers. It's not just a quick wash and wax. Within these nondescript buildings at the edge of Newark Bay, inspections are done, repairs are made and hundreds of accessories, from satellite radios to alloy wheels to roof racks, are installed. Take, for example, the sprawling 250-acre operation of FAPS, which has the contracts for makers including Ferrari, Honda, Mazda, Nissan and Volvo. The company, which moved to Newark 55 years ago from New York, established itself repairing the damage done when imported cars were still hoisted off the ship by cranes. Today its services still include body repairs (though cars are now driven from the ship's hold) but it also does the accessory installations and manages distribution logistics.

Toyota's 98-acre operation at Newark's port is something of a scaled-down assembly plant, though the work -- adding a range of so-called port-installed options into 21 different models -- is done largely by hand using simple tools, not by industrial robots controlled by computers. About 185 employees work in Toyota's car wash, quality control center and five production shops here. By adding items like floormats and GPS systems at its distribution centers instead of at its factories, Toyota gives customers a chance to tinker with their orders until just two days before the vehicles dock in Newark. And it gives dealers a way to stand apart from their competitors. ""We want to tailor the vehicle to what the customer wants,"" said Bill Barrett, the national logistics manager at the Newark location. ""We build the car they want."" The facility, which Toyota has operated for more than two decades, serves as a way station for up to 12,500 cars at a time that arrive by ship from Japan. Nearly every Toyota, Lexus and Scion built in Japan and destined for sale from Virginia to Maine passes through the facility. In a typical week, two shiploads of Toyotas arrive, though since the March tsunami slowed production, the pace has slowed to one ship a week. The process of customizing the roughly 3,000 vehicles that arrive on each ship starts the day before it docks in Newark. That's when John Hagel, who runs the driving team, determines how many longshoremen and drivers will be needed to get the vehicles to their parking spots, which are assigned by the accessories to be added.

Next, the bar codes on the shipping manifests, which include a list of accessories to be added, are scanned. Lexus vehicles, which receive more attention than Toyotas and Scions, are also driven on a bumpy track to check for squeaks and rattles. This month, Toyota's production returned to pre-tsunami levels. That means more to do for Nelson Noda's team of about a dozen workers, whose job is to install electronics, including alarms, satellite radios and remote starters. The work is done as the cars move down the middle of a building about the size of a football field. Employees at the work stations to the left and right complete a variety of tasks. One worker spent about 30 minutes installing a Bluetooth hands-free system under the steering column of a red Prius. He needed just a few tools to complete his task and test the system. ""Everything is now plug-and-play,"" Mr. Noda said. ""No splicing wires like we did years ago."" At the opposite end of the shop, another set of workers unbolted the factory-installed wheels from a 4Runner and replaced them with alloy rims. In the next shop, teams installed wheel locks, bumper protectors, body moldings and a variety of exterior items, including a clear film that helps to prevent paint chips on front ends. Nearby, two workers used a metal fixture to determine where to drill holes before bolting a roof rack on an S.U.V. The work would grind to a halt without Rui Sousa, whose job it is to order accessories daily from suppliers, based on expected needs in two days' time. The key, he said, is limiting the volume of accessories for unpopular cars or those that are undergoing model changes, while keeping enough on hand for more popular cars.

""We're trying to find the right balance,"" said Mr. Sousa, who has honed his orders so finely that the amount of just-in-time inventory has been cut by about two-thirds during the last four years. Port facilities were not always about efficiency or convenience. In past years they provided a place to install parts not available near the factories or to add catalytic converters and other equipment needed on imported vehicles to meet local regulations. Ports have also played a role in trade tiffs, providing a workaround for retaliatory taxes by making it possible for Japanese automakers to import just the cab and chassis of small pickups and install the cargo bed at the port when they landed. In all, vehicles spend from two and six days at Toyota's facility, depending on the work they require. It takes on average another 1.9 days for a vehicle, once completed, to leave the facility. Some 112,000 Toyotas are expected to arrive here this year by ship from Japan -- about a third of the peak in 2006, a result of the weak economy and the tsunami. Another 279,000 vehicles are expected to arrive by rail from Toyota factories in North America and go directly to dealerships. Even in the downturn, Newark is Toyota's busiest port in the United States. BMW's port operation takes a different approach, putting its logistics center some three miles away in Jersey City. That means having to drive up to 1,500 BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce models that arrive by boat each week from Germany (with a stop in Britain) or South Africa to the facility, an all-day job for as many as 100 drivers. Because many BMWs are effectively made to order, the range of accessories installed in New Jersey is generally limited more to performance kits and cosmetic items like spoilers, air dams and custom wheels, said Carol Furey, the facility manager. ""We're an extension of the factory,"" Ms. Furey said, ""the quality check at the end of production.""","At the port of Newark, N.J., dedicated facilities prepare new cars arriving from overseas. Inspections are done, repairs are made and accessories are installed.",de9a70c1-ce52-5bd3-be7a-5ed07f2b7bb6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/09/25/automobiles/25PORT1/25PORT1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=315&w=600&s=b97589e4147ab4d4dfd3fde401dbc525670ff0eada32f8d7b98c20ec851ef6d8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"NEW ARRIVALS More than 100,000 Toyotas will arrive at Port Newark by ship this year.",de9a70c1-ce52-5bd3-be7a-5ed07f2b7bb6,N24News/imgs/de9a70c1-ce52-5bd3-be7a-5ed07f2b7bb6.jpg,23
Sports,"When You Love, and Loathe, Watching the N.F.L.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/sports/football/nfl-season-restart.html,"It was the return of a lost love. Did you savor the slingshot passes Patrick Mahomes hurled across the field for Kansas City? How was it to watch Tom Brady taking command of the ""Tompa Bay"" Buccaneers? Did it give you the joy you needed in these uncertain times? Or did you feel something else? The return of a lost love comes with risk. The N.F.L. is back. Aside from a doubleheader on Monday night, its first fraught and long-awaited week is in the books. But did the league's sudden, large-scale embrace of Black Lives Matter have the gloss of a put-on? Maybe the prerecorded crowd noise sounded flat and fake. When fans were allowed in the stands, 16,000 went to Arrowhead Stadium on Thursday night to cheer Mahomes and the Chiefs. Were they in a fog of denial?

After so many endless, pent-up weeks, maybe you couldn't wait to see the impossible tackles and stunning touchdowns. But at the same time, maybe you worried about what the return of professional football might mean for sports, for the nation and for all of us. Hold tight. We could be one big outbreak of Covid-19 away from a calamity and deep regret. The N.F.L. is hardly alone. Over the weekend, tennis crowned new U.S. Open champions in the empty echoes of Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York. Golf is back, with its own restrictions, and so is college football. The N.B.A. and N.H.L. playoffs are underway, sealed away from everyone but coaches, reporters and league officials, and in the N.B.A.'s case, family members.

The health risk to players during the coronavirus pandemic is obvious and significant. Football is hand-to-hand combat, waged by men who are often at particular risk because of their girth, coached by men who are often at particular risk because of their age. ""This isn't baseball, or not even basketball,"" Pete Carroll, the 68-year-old coach of the Seattle Seahawks, said to me when we spoke the other day. Carroll is a big believer in the steps that teams took during training camp to control the virus. But he is also aware of the risks. ""We got guys in freakin' huddles and lines of scrimmage, and, you know, we're just all over each other."" Is the return of our most popular sport sending a false alert that we have almost conquered the virus? Consider this terrible number: 193,700. That, at the very least, is how many Americans it has killed so far.

Consider, as well, that many of us have lost our shock at that number. Think of it this way: It is nearly four times the number of Americans killed in the Vietnam War. It is almost three times the number of fans in attendance at Soldier Field in Chicago when it is full for football games. The death toll, 193,700 and growing, should never become an abstraction, just another number that we fail to honor or learn from.

Will the deep desire for normalcy, heralded by the return of the N.F.L., add to our lack of focus, our fog of denial -- and the difficulty we are having in our efforts to tame not only the virus, but racism? On the field before the Chiefs played the Houston Texans in the season opener, players and coaches, Black and white, linked arms in a display of unity against injustice. The derisive boos they heard from the fans were a reminder that some want not only a return to normal, but also a return to a world that bucks against the societal shifts of 2020. That said, no part of our eagerness for sports should be a surprise. It is understandably human. We need joy, after all, and to find distraction in times of trouble. The urge to play and watch games might be hard-wired.

The N.F.L. was not around when we fought World War I and the Spanish flu at the same time. But baseball, then the unchallenged national pastime, did not stop. Perhaps it should have. Players grew seriously ill, including Babe Ruth, who is said to have caught the disease twice. He recovered. But an umpire died. Historians, including Randy Roberts of Purdue University, say that fans attending the 1918 World Series and celebrating the champion Boston Red Sox likely contributed to one of the worst outbreaks of the Spanish flu. The pandemic ended up killing about 675,000 Americans. In 1942, when the United States fully entered World War II, baseball was still the nation's most popular sport. Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis asked President Franklin D. Roosevelt whether major league games should be canceled. Roosevelt replied with what became known as his green light letter. ""I honestly feel,"" the president wrote, ""it would be best for the country to keep baseball going."" Victoria Jackson, a sports historian at Arizona State University, reminded me this week: ""World War II was a time when the nation came together with a shared sense of sacrifice. Baseball was seen as a reward that was earned for that sacrifice."" Have Americans sacrificed collectively in their wars against racism and the coronavirus?

Is the N.F.L. joining in the message? We're back. We can do this. The normal days of old are just around the bend. During weeks of disciplined, highly controlled training camps, only less than 1 percent of its players tested positive for the virus. But now, Carroll said, comes the hard part -- ""the big challenge."" Now players, coaches and staff will be crisscrossing the country for games. Some of those games will have fans in the stands. During the coming weeks, we are likely to see a push for more crowds, and larger ones, too -- in parts of the country that are still laden with suffering. The N.F.L. is back, but should we still love it? Kurt Streeter is the new Sports of The Times columnist.

Well,A Fat Dad Election,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/08/well/family/a-fat-dad-election.html,"It was 1972, and George McGovern was running against Richard Nixon for president.



I had just moved from a suburban area of Chicago to a bohemian neighborhood of Manhattan, and starting fourth grade in a new school felt akin to entering a foreign land. All the girls had long, straggly hair; the boys didn't look much different.

My peers, sporting provocative buttons and stickers on their rainbow-colored backpacks and T-shirts, looked like billboards for the Democratic campaign. Most had walked with their parents in Vietnam War protests and raised money to save the planet. Our homeroom teacher, with his braided, silver beard, guided us on our school projects but also spoke about activism and was not shy about expressing his choice for the next president. The heartsick feeling I'd had about leaving Chicago, where every day for a snack we'd have Manischewitz grape juice and Tam Tam crackers, was quickly replaced by the excitement of the antiwar movement, granola bars and the coming election.

My 450-pound dad, who worked in advertising and was always in search of the perfect diet or slogan, creating famous tag lines like ""Leggo my Eggo"" and ""Go for the Gusto,"" was spending his free time making phone calls for the cause or putting up McGovern posters that we bought on St. Marks Place from a man with a six-inch Afro, mutton-chop sideburns, silk pajamas and a neck full of beads. And for the first time ever, he made no mention of being on a special diet.

Until that election, most of our conversations centered around food: what he was going to eat, or not going to eat, or the diet du jour. By the time I was 9 -- halfway to voting age -- I had lived on every miracle plan that my dad believed would make him thin and keep him thin. I even prayed beside him while he read ""I Prayed Myself Slim,"" and ate seven to 10 apples a day when he was on the ""Israeli Army Diet.""","We walked to a McGovern rally, not even stopping for my dad's favorite soft pretzel or the warm chestnuts that usually called his name from blocks away.",d9d0ac4a-68da-58f4-8227-ff946061674f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/01/well/family/well-family-fatdadelection/well-family-fatdadelection-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=75cc5c55833c23a572741abbb74610ab80551aa8a1f03810591a92b928f22172&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The author's father, Al Lerman, in 1972.",d9d0ac4a-68da-58f4-8227-ff946061674f,N24News/imgs/d9d0ac4a-68da-58f4-8227-ff946061674f.jpg,18
Books,"A New Mom, Her Nannies and the Often Exploitive Labor of Motherhood",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/books/review/megan-stack-womens-work.html,"WOMEN'S WORK 

A Reckoning With Work and Home

 By  Motherhood is an exercise that both equalizes and divides. It's an experience shared by women across the world -- a lesson in dissolving borders, in love and in sleep deprivation. It is work: a flow of activity that requires organizational thinking and endless labor. It is also an institution that clings to gender stereotypes and casts a harsh light on class and race -- the firm boundaries of opportunity and care that privileged parents can draw around their own children, often to the detriment of other people's. ""Some problems we share as women,"" Audre Lorde famously observed in a 1980 speech at Amherst College. ""Some we do not.""

  sets out in ""Women's Work"" to explore the underside of motherhood -- the realities of labor and child care that men ignore and that women of privilege regularly gloss over: leaving the nannies and cleaners out of their books, excluding them from social media posts and rendering their work invisible. ""I'm complicit,"" Stack writes. ""The women I've rented are sweeping the floor outside my office even as I type; I hear the swish of their brooms over the boards."" Stack's book is a memoir in three parts, tracing her experience of motherhood while living in China and India, and recounting the relationships she forms with the women who work in her home. Stack, a former foreign correspondent for The Los Angeles Times, has covered multiple wars, reported from Egypt and served as the paper's bureau chief in Moscow. At the start of the book, Stack is still a reporter, still accustomed to jumping on a plane at a moment's notice or running toward whatever crisis is happening nearby. And then, pregnant with her first child, she decides to quit her job and attempt to write a novel. She envisions motherhood as a kind of writing retreat, a gently napping baby in the corner as sun streams through the window. It's an idyll that disintegrates nearly as soon as the baby, a boy, arrives home from the hospital.

""The cold reality of my gender was dawning on me,"" Stack writes. ""Somebody, after all, must wash and feed and train the kids and get the food and clean the house and care for the sick and elderly."" Early on, she describes this work not as a job, but as a ""constant gaping demand for labor."" (This is a characterization I disagree with -- child care requires labor, yes, but also skill and a body of knowledge, whether earned by experience, passed down from family members or found in books.) Stack is overwhelmed by her domestic responsibilities; she is exhausted and anxious: ""Just thinking about getting any more tired was like sliding slowly and nauseously down the walls of a carnival Gravitron that has just stopped spinning."" Her loss of identity is so profound that early in the book she arrives home from a dinner out and starts writing an essay titled ""How to Disappear.""

When Stack's husband, Tom, returns to work two weeks after their son is born, Stack hires her first nanny -- who also cooks and cleans -- a woman named Xiao Li. The low value placed on the work the two women are doing hangs over the household like a cloud. Tom, infuriatingly, insists on calling Xiao Li ""the maid."" His exacting standards and Stack's sleep deprivation make it difficult to work, even with help, and his questions about her writing are loaded and tense. ""If Tom and I were willing to live in a messy apartment, or to eat more takeout, then the addition of Xiao Li might have signified an easy path back to my writing desk,"" she writes. ""But we're both neat freaks and Tom is a picky eater, and since Xiao Li had started working for us, he didn't see any need to accept an unkempt domestic existence."" As Stack gets more comfortable in her role as mother and employer, she realizes that she is leaving Xiao Li out of family photos. Moreover, most of the women she knows do the same, implying that they are capable of doing the work of motherhood all on their own, rendering the true labor invisible. ""Like Apple computers or Goodyear tires, I reaped the benefit of cheap Chinese labor,"" she writes. The difference, however, is that she loves Xiao Li. Here is a woman who knows the rhythms of Stack's home, the moods of her child and the preferences of her husband. In early motherhood, Stack makes clear, Xiao Li keeps her afloat. The conflicts to come are wrenching and Stack is unflinching in her account. Xiao Li, who has a young daughter of her own, gives Stack's son a plastic toy for Christmas. The gift traps Stack between Xiao Li and her husband -- who is convinced the toy is toxic -- and Stack wonders: ""It was the only sort of toy her daughter would ever have. How could I dismiss it as a kidney failure waiting to happen? I might as well announce that her life and its contents were too cheap, her country too disgusting, our baby too precious for her offerings."" When Xiao Li's own daughter becomes ill, Stack scrambles to balance her concern for the other woman with her understanding that time off for Xiao Li means infringement on her own shrunken supply of professional time. A single person -- a nanny -- is no stand-in for a life jacket.

It is after Stack moves to India and hires two new women -- Pooja and Mary -- to help cook, clean and raise Stack's growing family that the account of her domestic life starts to feel limited. Her prose is beautiful as she shines light on the contradictions of her position. With respect to supporting a family, she writes: ""There is a lingering expectation that men will pay in money. But when it comes to time, it is almost always the woman who pays. And money is one thing, but time is life, and life is more."" In India, however, the gulf between her situation and those of the women in her household begins to feel too vast, the poverty surrounding her too extreme. It becomes increasingly clear that the problems facing the women who work for her extend far beyond this particular domestic setting -- and beyond Stack's ability to access and understand them fully. It is late in the book when Stack announces her plans to her friends -- that she will write about the compromises of her domestic life and the lives of her employees. This, she says, almost always went badly: ""As if the simple exercise of placing myself alongside the nannies was already an affront."" Stack's relationships with these women, however, make writing about them difficult. Xiao Li has little interest in letting her former employer in on the details of her own life. In India, she follows Pooja to her home village, where we get a glimpse of the forces that have been at work in Pooja's life (poverty, casual rape, domestic violence and a tenuous local political situation), but the visit feels truncated, Pooja's life available to us only in outline. We never get a sense of how she spends her days, the details that make a person seem real. In the book's conclusion, Stack tells us: ""The answer is the men. They have to do the work."" It's hard not to wonder whether, for Xiao Li or for Pooja, a more egalitarian domestic sphere would be enough; they share some of Stack's problems, but not all. In that same speech at Amherst, Audre Lorde was offering a way forward for the women's movement in the 1980s. ""It is not our differences which separate women, but our reluctance to recognize those differences,"" she told her audience. ""The future of our earth may depend upon the ability of all women to identify and develop new definitions of power and new patterns of relating across difference."" At its best moments, Stack's book is a sharply observed, evocative reckoning with the ways her struggles intersect and diverge with those of the women she employs. As it progresses, however, her own narrative overshadows those of the women she wishes to reveal. She shows us how we have ignored these women and exploited them. She names the difference, but as readers we do not get to travel across it.","""Women's Work,"" by Megan Stack, a former foreign correspondent for The Los Angeles Times, is an unflinching look at the women who maintained her home, took care of her children and allowed her to write a book.",14f80888-b1d9-55fe-a4e3-b9e2faac89ad,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/10/books/review/Hilgers01/Hilgers01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=8280fe8a5f05e73b55e80af05d8b8d3537604d8344cd731fd668f3233205e610&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Megan K.

Television,"Tom Kennedy, Genial Journeyman of TV Game Shows, Dies at 93",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/arts/television/tom-kennedy-dies.html,"Tom Kennedy, who earnestly shook the hands of losers and bestowed gee-whiz jollity on winners during a nearly 30-year career hosting television game shows, died on Oct. 7 at his home in Oxnard, Calif. He was 93.

Mr. Kennedy's longest reign as quizmaster was on ""Name That Tune,"" which was syndicated from 1974 to 1981. On that show, contestants guessed the titles of pop hits and American standards based on snippets played by a live band, or, more challengingly, a pianist hitting a handful of notes.

While the music played, Mr. Kennedy performed an avuncular dance, twisting his wrists and tapping his feet. Then, index cards in hand, he rendered the verdict on contestants' answers. In one segment of the show, he ceremonially gave winners $100 bills one by one.

Prizes might also include a new Datsun car or an 11-day trip to Hawaii to ""discover the aloha spirit."" Contestants would shriek, and Mr. Kennedy would gently encourage them. His characteristic remarks included ""Isn't that something?"" and ""She likes this game as much as I do.""","Mr. Kennedy brought gaiety and a dollop of schmaltz to his work as the host of 14 shows on multiple networks, and in syndication, over nearly 30 years.",f3a220a8-e108-5839-96ed-5ac3319fbeda,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/14/obituaries/Kennedy1/Kennedy1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=ace2d2531ce24e175a59e9415758eae2242ce92573dec1bd2f6ca1db781e080f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Tom Kennedy&rsquo;s get-up changed over his long career in game shows, but his smiling affability endured.",f3a220a8-e108-5839-96ed-5ac3319fbeda,N24News/imgs/f3a220a8-e108-5839-96ed-5ac3319fbeda.jpg,3
Real Estate,Camille Becerra Finds a Home via Instagram,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/realestate/camille-becerra-finds-a-home-via-instagram.html,"In 17 years of renting in New York,  found all her apartments through friends or word of mouth. But last November, when the man from whom she was renting an apartment in Chinatown gave her just 30 days to leave, she turned to a much larger social network: the photo-sharing site Instagram. Though unconventional, it was not quite the long shot it may seem -- Ms. Becerra, who appeared in 2007 on Season Three of the TV show ""Top Chef"" and has run the kitchens of buzzy New York restaurants including Navy in SoHo and Cafe Henrie on the Lower East Side, has 76,600 Instagram followers. Two of them sent her links to a school-turned-rental building on the Lower East Side. ""The building had only just started renting, so I was able to have my pick of places,"" said Ms. Becerra, who selected an exceptionally bright apartment on the fifth floor, for which she pays $3,700 a month.

She shares the place with her 15-year-old daughter, Paloma Rivera, and their black-and-white cat, Catty. In deference to the social obligations of teenagehood, she allowed Paloma to have the larger of the two sleeping areas, in a loft overlooking the main living space, which includes a good-sized front room where she can entertain friends and a teensy back bedroom with a window affording a glimpse of the Empire State Building. Ms. Becerra occupies a narrow room that she uses primarily as an office, sleeping in a nook.

Though her new apartment is not the charmer that her Chinatown place was -- ""it had embossed plaster walls and was so pretty that you barely needed furniture,"" Ms. Becerra recalled -- she quickly came to appreciate more about it than the 12-month lease. Living above the tree line means she can see a large amount of sky from her south-facing windows. The apartment's abundant space and natural light also allow her to host photo shoots there -- a huge boon for someone who has a sideline as a food stylist. And the airy open kitchen is an ideal place to develop recipes for the cookbook she's working on. It was a dark warren of cabinetry when she moved in. With her landlord's blessing, she ripped out most of the cabinets, replaced the countertops (free, thanks to a sponsor, Caesarstone, as were a set of streamlined appliances from Fagor), and hauled in two free-standing glass cabinets to hold her spices and dried goods. ""I like to be able to see what I have,"" she explained. She also replaced the ""standard-issue Home Depot-style"" light fixture in the living room with an arresting sculptural piece -- one of the few large objects she arrived with. Having moved three times in little more than three years, she and Paloma have pared down their possessions.

Before the Chinatown apartment, they shared a loft in TriBeCa that Ms. Becerra had taken over from a friend -- the same loft where they'd lived when Paloma was a newborn. (The place had been in her circle of friends since 1996.) Ms. Becerra decamped for Greenpoint, Brooklyn, after 9/11, worried about the impact of air pollution on her 6-month-old's lungs. They lived in a loft there with Paloma's father before mother and daughter moved to a two-bedroom railroad apartment, also in Greenpoint, where the rent was just $1,600. Ms. Becerra moved them back to Manhattan after a 2008 grease fire destroyed her Greenpoint restaurant, Paloma. ""I kept on talking to people about what happened. I was ready for a fresh break,"" Ms. Becerra said. They left the TriBeCa loft -- ""a very hippie-ish place, always cold in the winter"" -- when the owner of the building decided it was time for a renovation, which Ms. Becerra conceded was long overdue. She said she was thinking of expediency more than anything else when she moved into her current space, but it has proved well suited to her needs. Though living more than half a mile from the subway might bother some, she prefers to bike, and ""everything I need is down here -- the Union Square farmer's market, the Chinatown spice markets, the Bowery restaurant supply stores,"" she said.

Economy,The Coronavirus Economy: When Washington Takes Over Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/business/economy/coronavirus-relief-bill.html,"The $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package that the Senate passed on Wednesday will fundamentally transform the U.S. government by placing thousands of businesses and millions of workers on federally funded life support. The government will pay the wages of some workers who remain on their companies' payrolls. It will sustain other workers who have lost their jobs with checks that are as large as -- or even larger than -- what they were earning before they were laid off. And it will cushion some of the country's largest corporations from bankruptcy, with taxpayers taking shares in those companies as collateral. Rarely before has the government involved itself so deeply in the business of business. Amid a historic drop-off in economic activity, the bill temporarily transfers financial responsibility from private industry to the federal government, allowing the United States to control the levers of capitalism and potentially decide who wins and who loses. The level of intervention this week far outstrips the financial scope and breadth of recovery efforts during the 2008 financial crisis. That is a controversial proposition in normal times but one lawmakers deemed necessary now, as companies large and small, from airlines and big banks to nail salons and brew pubs, face unprecedented hardship. The ripple effects have already sent millions of Americans into unemployment.

""We went to bed as America and woke up the next morning looking like social democratic Europe,"" Erik Gordon, professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan, said. ""We've made fun of Europe propping up their failing steel companies and car companies, and when push comes to shove we're going to outdo them."" The government's intervention will come in a variety of ways, including direct payments to individuals and businesses, generous loans in which the government agrees to backstop losses and equity stakes in companies. But there are strings attached, such as limits on executive pay and provisions that require companies receiving assistance to maintain employment levels at 90 percent of what they were. Midsize companies, or those with between 500 and 10,000 employees, get to borrow at an interest rate that is not higher than 2 percent annually, and don't have to repay principal or interest for six months. The midsize companies cannot ""outsource or offshore"" jobs from the start of the loan until two years after it has been repaid. Businesses with 500 or fewer employees will get loans directly from banks to cover more than two months of payrolls and some other operating expenses, with the government paying off the balance so long as the companies either do not lay off workers or rehire ones they've already let go. The government will inject more than $60 billion into the airline industry, including $25 billion in grants to pay employees of passenger airlines and $4 billion for those who work at cargo airlines. About $17 billion has been set aside largely for Boeing, which, because of two deadly crashes, was troubled before the virus brought many commercial flights to a standstill.

Not all businesses will be eligible for help, and not every eligible company will agree to the government's terms. And some industries, including cruise lines and energy companies, were left on the sidelines. The major cruise companies appear not to qualify for loans because they are domiciled outside the United States and their employees are spread across the world. ""We didn't seek or expect a cash bailout, and it doesn't appear anyway that we would qualify under the terms,"" said Roger Frizzell, a spokesman for Carnival Corporation. ""We have a significant employee presence in the U.S., but a majority of our employees are on ships, not in any location, certainly not based in the U.S."" The legislation also does not include $3 billion that the Trump administration requested to buy crude oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Such a purchase could have helped lift demand for oil, and thus its price, which in the United States has tumbled to less than $25 a barrel in recent weeks. Solar and wind businesses were upset that lawmakers did not make it easier for them to benefit from tax credits for renewable energy.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The epicenter of the intervention will be the Treasury Department, where Secretary Steven Mnuchin will oversee nearly a third of the $2 trillion in economic relief funds that Congress is approving. The money will be held in two pots: $350 billion will be devoted to loans and loan guarantees for small businesses. And $500 billion will be divided among airlines and companies that are critical to national security, including Boeing, and will prop up the Federal Reserve's new emergency lending facilities, which are intended to inject nearly $4 trillion into the economy. Mr. Mnuchin said on Thursday that the distribution of the money would be fully transparent. ""When we do take actions, either through our direct program or throughout programs with the Fed, there will be disclosures to the American public much faster than they would normally occur,"" he said on CNBC.

Businesses will also have to cede some control to the federal government in exchange for lifelines. Companies that borrow money are forbidden to repurchase their stock or pay dividends during the loan and for a year after it is repaid. They must not cut staffing by more than 10 percent through the end of September. Loans to small businesses, with 500 employees or fewer, are limited to $10 million. Loans to cover salaries of over $100,000 wouldn't qualify for forgiveness, and businesses must demonstrate that they had not recently laid off employees, or a smaller amount of the loan would be subject to forgiveness. Businesses would not have to repay loans covering up to eight weeks' worth of payroll expenses. That means that once businesses receive their loans, a new clock will begin to tick: They'll have to use the money within two months to avoid repaying it; they also can't pay any employee more than $10,000 in those two months if they want that amount to be forgiven. Lawmakers also placed restrictions on compensation and pay increases for executives, moves intended to address one of the criticisms about bailouts during the 2008 crisis. But pay limits will not necessarily do away with multimillion-dollar paydays for corporate bosses. Executives who made more than $3 million in 2019 could be awarded $3 million, plus half of any sum in excess of $3 million. As a result, a chief executive who earned $20 million in 2019 would be allowed compensation of $11.5 million. The restrictions would apply from the time the federal support began to one year after it ended. Even as the government takes on an outsize role in overseeing companies, Mr. Mnuchin maintained that it should not be in the business of dictating what private companies did. ""We don't believe in mandating and regulating certain big businesses,"" he said. And big business, despite its need for help, has seemed unwilling to cede too much control to the government. On Tuesday, Boeing's chief executive, David Calhoun, suggested that he wasn't interested in the government's taking an equity stake in the company, despite the beleaguered state of the aerospace giant.","The $2 trillion aid package is expected to save jobs and bail out companies, but it reorders the relationship between government and private industry.",0f968f28-7439-5315-9a5e-7a8169a8c6ca,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/27/business/26virus-govbiz-print/merlin_170977653_b9f99360-056c-4f8a-b2d5-8e508d418402-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=120f574d4f3b47b9d5ef44e382d00d2df1ac3eadc77c0f7bf8b709f9780516f1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The measures the Senate passed on Wednesday far surpass the scope and breadth of recovery efforts during the 2008 financial crisis.,0f968f28-7439-5315-9a5e-7a8169a8c6ca,N24News/imgs/0f968f28-7439-5315-9a5e-7a8169a8c6ca.jpg,8
Food,Garlicky Braised Greens for When That Vegetable Craving Hits,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/dining/garlicky-braised-greens-coronavirus.html,"A big bowl of garlicky, soupy greens is what I craved today, probably my body's natural response to all the poundcake and cookies I've been obsessively baking. So I took a deep breath, looked out the window at the blossoming trees, and cooked something green.

I had some baby kale I got from the farmers' market this past weekend, but I use this basic recipe with any kind of saute-able green, from spinach to chard to collards.

To make it, wash the greens and slice them into ribbons if the pieces are big. (I skipped this since my kale leaves were tiny.) Heat some olive oil in a skillet. Be generous. After all, it's just greens; they can use the richness.

Then, to the pan, add a couple of thinly sliced garlic cloves and a pinch of red-pepper flakes, and some chopped anchovies if you like. Sometimes, I also throw in sliced onion or scallions for sweetness. Let it cook for 30 seconds to a minute, just long enough to turn the garlic golden, but not brown. Add the greens and a few tablespoons of broth or water, and some salt. Lower the heat and let the greens braise, stirring once in a while, until they are tender, anywhere from 5 minutes for young, soft-leafed greens like baby spinach, or longer, up to 20 minutes, for mature, tougher greens. Most but not all of the liquid should evaporate, but I like them soupy.","This brothy, flavorful dish may be just what you're looking for after all those baking projects and beans.",d4d28a23-bc67-5fa7-8a80-eea41cac1abf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/28/dining/07pantry-blog/07pantry-blog-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=ba835855a093745bca657c0dc57130dcfb5d03b7e4ab54830f01f397542f9f0f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Garlicky Greens,d4d28a23-bc67-5fa7-8a80-eea41cac1abf,N24News/imgs/d4d28a23-bc67-5fa7-8a80-eea41cac1abf.jpg,17
Books,What Samantha Power Learned on the Job,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/books/review/the-education-of-an-idealist-samantha-power.html,"THE EDUCATION OF AN IDEALIST

A Memoir

By Samantha Power Whenever The New York Times invites me to do a book review, I look for an excuse. I'd rather spend my extra time writing books than reviewing them. But when the Book Review editors asked me to review Samantha Power's ""The Education of an Idealist: A Memoir,"" I said yes, without hesitation. It wasn't because I suddenly had time on my hands. And it certainly wasn't because Power is a friend. I've met her only once -- in her last week as Barack Obama's ambassador to the United Nations. No, it was because I knew only one thing about Power -- from afar. She was a table-pounding idealist and human rights advocate, and believed in using American power to protect innocent civilians and advance democracy. And lately I have struggled with that position. Having been a foreign correspondent in London, in Beirut during its civil war, in Israel and then the foreign affairs columnist for this newspaper since 1995, I'd long wrestled with how much idealism one should allow oneself when advocating for or against the uses of American power abroad. I began reporting from the Middle East in 1979 with a lot of Minnesota optimism in my DNA. Alas, idealism is now a recessive gene in me after so many crushed hopes and covering one-too-many massacres. I am much more wary today -- not isolationist, but wary -- about what well-intentioned outsiders can do to sustainably reshape another country or region. George W. Bush was right on one thing about the Iraq war -- many Iraqis wanted to be free to be more democratic once the tyranny of Saddam Hussein was lifted from their necks. But many other Iraqis wanted to be free to be more Shiite, more Sunni Jihadist, more corrupt or just more powerful than the tribe or sect next door. No, Toto, everywhere is not like Kansas. The only Arab Spring country that was able to make the transition (albeit still tentative) from dictatorship to democracy, and to power-sharing between Islamists and secularists, was Tunisia -- the one Arab country America had nothing to do with. Think about that. And Burma's Aung San Suu Kyi showed how even a Nobel Peace Prize can't guarantee that today's human rights heroine won't become tomorrow's victimizer. Yet Obama's intervention in West Africa to stem the spread of Ebola -- maybe his most significant foreign policy achievement, for which he got little credit precisely because it worked -- demonstrated that without America as quarterback, important things that save lives and advance freedom at reasonable costs often don't happen.

So I was curious. This Samantha Power -- she had started her career as a journalist covering the mass killing of Bosnian Muslims by Serbs, which led her to write a Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ""'A Problem From Hell': America in the Age of Genocide,"" about why American leaders who vow ""never again"" repeatedly fail to halt genocides. She had worked as a foreign policy adviser to Senator Obama, and then as a human rights adviser to President Obama before ultimately becoming his second United Nations ambassador. People told me she was a real idealist -- not a tortured one like me. But then she had to eat some heaping plates of realism in public, like defending Obama's nonintervention in the genocidal Syrian civil war. I wondered: How did she wrestle with all that as she went from reporter-author to policymaker? So I told the Book Review editors: ""Yes. I'd like to review her book."" I wanted to see how she sorted it all out. I'm glad I did. This is a wonderful book. It's an unusual combination of autobiography, diplomatic history, moral argument and manual on how to breast-feed a child with one hand while talking to Secretary of State John Kerry on a cellphone with the other. The interweaving of Power's personal story, family story, diplomatic history and moral arguments is executed seamlessly -- and with unblinking honesty.

The book isn't all about world affairs. One of the most compelling chapters is about when Power joined the Obama presidential campaign as a foreign policy adviser but ended up making news herself for a ""large and public mistake."" That was describing Obama's rival, Hillary Clinton, as a ""monster"" -- while on a book tour in Ireland no less -- and being forced to resign from the campaign. But when the man that her Irish cousins called ""O'bama"" wins the 2008 election, he brings her back into the fold. To ease her way back, her friend and the Obama adviser Richard Holbrooke -- as a wedding gift -- arranges for Power to have a private face-to-face meeting to apologize to Clinton and clear the air. When Power tells Obama about the ""wedding gift,"" the president quips, ""Don't most people get toasters?""

With America being run today by a president for whom no dictator is too odious to call his friend, I found it something of a balm to journey with this Irish immigrant girl from the basement of a Dublin pub, where Power spent way too much time as a little girl reading books while her dad held court in the bar upstairs, to America, where she emigrates with her mom in the 1970s and falls in love in equal parts with the Pittsburgh Pirates and American idealism. Not the cheap flag-waving variety, but the belief that America is more than just a country. It's a mission to promote justice and human rights where it can. When it comes to striking that right balance between idealism and realism, this book is basically a dialogue between the young, uncompromising, superidealistic Power -- who cold-calls senior American officials at night at home to berate them for not doing more to stop the killing in Bosnia -- and the more sober policymaker Power, who struggles to balance her idealism with realism, and who frets that she's become one of those officials she despised.

The older Power is not at all a cynic, but she is less ramrod straight. Her posture is what I like to call a tilt. Always tilted toward using American power to defend the defenseless, moderate the tyrannical, rescue the needy and inspire and strengthen the forces of decency -- but when she loses the argument to do so in one country, she doesn't resign. She looks for somewhere else to fix. Does that sound like an idealist selling out to hold onto the perks of power, or one who keeps looking to fight another day another way? You decide. And you can -- because Power is unstinting in giving you all the ammunition you need to denounce or defend her. [ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of September. See the full list. ] Drawing often from her journals, she shares what colleagues and friends saw, at times, as her annoying self-righteousness. The young Power that we meet early on is in Sarajevo berating herself in her journal for not personally preventing the 1995 murder of some 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica: ""I was the correspondent in Munich while the bodies burned in Dachau. ... I had power and I failed to use it."" Writing now, she says, ""In beating myself up, I was clearly exaggerating my actual power back in Sarajevo."" (I'd say so!) She quotes the American diplomat Jonathan Moore, who advised her on the choice of continuing to report from Bosnia in hopes of changing policy or going to Harvard Law School: ""Get the hell out of there. You need to break out of the compulsion for power, glory, ego, relevance, contribution."" The elder Power takes you on the roller coaster ride of being the leading in-house advocate for idealism on the Obama team. Power argued for intervention in Syria, at least for a no-fly zone that might have tilted the balance of power there enough so the Syrian regime would negotiate with the pro-democracy rebels. But Obama overrules her, fearing an endless quagmire. We don't know what would have happened had Power's advice been taken. All we know are two things: 1) America was spared getting deeply involved in another Middle East internal struggle without a clear exit strategy, and 2) our absence helped the Russians, the Iranians and the Syrian regime crush the rebels and produce a flood of refugees into the European Union that led to a populist-nationalist backlash there that contributed to Brexit and weakened the E.U.

In Libya, Obama took the advice of Clinton, Power and our NATO allies and helped to decapitate the regime of Muammar Qaddafi -- to prevent him from killing large numbers of antiregime Libyans. But when we and the Europeans failed to organize a follow-up peacekeeping force on the ground, Libya descended into disorder, unleashing another destabilizing refugee flow into Europe. Obama's team and our allies had willed the ends without willing the means. Idealism untempered by an understanding of the complex interplay of forces inside a country ends up in this sort of mess. During these various debates about Libya and Syria, Power quotes Obama as snapping at her when he felt her comments came across as ""dogmatic or sanctimonious."" During a Situation Room debate on Syria, as Power was advocating for stronger action, Obama wearily says to her: ""We've all read your book, Samantha."" Obama, she recalls, repeatedly told her, ""you get on my nerves."" But at the same time, when she wouldn't speak up for idealism, Obama would ask her: ""Are you sick, Power?"" He wanted to hear it. It's complicated. Power regularly debated with herself about resigning in protest over Obama's refusal to intervene decisively in Syria. She asks herself whether she'd become what Obama's human rights critics said he'd become -- just another ""realist,"" but one who ""feels bad about it."" In the end, she stays, quoting a friend who tells her ""the world is filled with broken places. Pick your battles, and go win some,"" and quoting Obama -- ""better is good."" Perfect is rarely on the menu. And then, in the best chapter in the book, Power gives us the ammo to see how even just striving for better can lead to unforeseen complications. The chapter is entitled ""Toussaint."" In 2016, Power decides to visit Cameroon, Chad and Nigeria ""to meet with people on the front lines of the fight"" against the terrorist group Boko Haram, which had kidnapped nearly 300 schoolgirls, so that she could draw attention to their struggle the way a visit from a high-ranking American official can do. It was a dangerous trip and required a caravan of some 14 armored vehicles. Locals lined the roads on their way to Mokolo, a town in rural Cameroon. There, Power hears about how a village's ""vigilance committee"" used stones and bows and arrows to kill a young woman who had entered a local market with a suicide belt under her hijab. She also recalls, though, how some of these same local guardian groups attacked people as ""Boko Haram"" in order to steal their livestock. Yes, not every good guy is a good guy. But as Power is leaving the village an aide whispers to her: ""As we were driving here our car hit a young boy."" The boy's name was Toussaint. He was killed. ""Had we not come,"" she writes, ""a 6-year-old boy would still be alive."" Nonetheless, the trip helped Power and others to lobby the United Nations for an additional $168 million in humanitarian assistance for people menaced by Boko Haram. Was it worth it? Again, she gives you all the ammo to decide. Yet Power remains steadfast in her tilt: ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions, to be sure,"" she writes. ""But turning a blind eye to the toughest problems in the world is a guaranteed shortcut to the same destination."" I can imagine a course for incoming diplomats at the State Department that would use Power's book as a text, and the final exam question would be: ""In 500 words or less, explain whether you identify with the younger Power or the older Power.""","""The Education of an Idealist,"" by Samantha Power, describes how her years with the Obama administration forced her to alter her thinking on foreign policy.",cc4d0550-dfd1-5d00-86ee-2ecbc5aae907,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/29/books/review/Friedman01-PRINT/Friedman01-PRINT-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=b0bb2bb99a503b726d76fbf2be22e3a16357a47ada0d74d691247b816f75cebc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Samantha Power with President Barack Obama, Sept. 12, 2013.",cc4d0550-dfd1-5d00-86ee-2ecbc5aae907,N24News/imgs/cc4d0550-dfd1-5d00-86ee-2ecbc5aae907.jpg,13
Technology,Chrome's Glass Ceiling on an iPhone,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/technology/personaltech/chrome-iphone-default.html,"Q. My iPhone opens up web pages in Safari. Is there a way to change the default browser to Chrome?

A. The current version of the iOS software uses Apple's Safari browser and does not allow you to select different browser apps to automatically open links. As Google's own support pages for the iOS version of Chrome note, ""You can't make Chrome your default browser, but you can add it to your dock."" Adding the app to the dock -- that strip of icons along the bottom of the screen -- will not make Chrome jump up to open links you may get in a text or an email message, but it does keep the icon within thumb range when you'd like to start browsing.

To put Chrome in the iPhone's dock, you may need to make room for it by moving another app's icon first. In the dock, just press and hold your finger on the app you want to move until it begins to wiggle, then drag it up to a different part of the home screen. While the apps are still wiggling, drag the Chrome icon into the dock. Press the Home button to calm the icons.

It is not impossible to change your iPhone's default apps or tinker around with other settings, even though Apple's official version of iOS prohibits such actions. However, to do that, you need to ""jailbreak"" your device and install unauthorized software on it. Apple deeply frowns on this activity and will not generally provide technical support for a jailbroken phone running someone else's software.","Apple may prevent you from swapping out some of its own apps for your preferred defaults, but you can at least get your choices within easy reach.",385a44f2-0988-5865-acd8-05121b30bccf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/17/technology/personaltech/17techtipwebART/17techtipwebART-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=6cd82241f2a4dd40df7cd5f39e353bfa3cd0cf72e3cdc3f59de7c72c6917864e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"It may not be a default app, but you can at least put the Chrome browser icon in the iPhone's dock so you can find it quickly.",385a44f2-0988-5865-acd8-05121b30bccf,N24News/imgs/385a44f2-0988-5865-acd8-05121b30bccf.jpg,20

Real Estate,House Hunting on Bonaire: Perched Above the Caribbean for $1.5 Million,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/realestate/bonaire-cairbbean-sea.html,"A Four-Bedroom Villa on the Coast of Bonaire This four-bedroom, Mediterranean-inspired villa sits just outside Kralendijk, the capital city of Bonaire, a Caribbean island in the Leeward Antilles known for its world-class scuba diving. The island, situated about 60 miles off the coast of Venezuela, is one of the ABC Islands (together with Aruba and Curacao) belonging to the Netherlands. The 5,382-square-foot house is set on a hillside in the exclusive Sabadeco Terrace neighborhood, with views of Bonaire's western coastline and the Caribbean Sea. Surrounded by palm, fruit, allspice and rubber trees, the property, on about two-thirds of an acre, includes a separate studio apartment, a greenhouse, a 270-square-foot swimming pool, and numerous patios and terraces. Robert Cooper, a director with 7th Heaven Properties, which has the listing, called it ""one of the finest homes for sale on Bonaire,"" with warm Mediterranean-style design influences ""on one of the most tranquil islands in the Caribbean.""

Built in 1997, the house has plastered concrete block walls painted white and terra cotta floor tiles. The front door opens to a spacious living area with high ceilings and a staircase leading up to the second floor. The kitchen is through an archway to the right. To the left, a wrought-iron gate opens to a hallway leading to the main bedroom and an office. French doors open to the large covered terrace and pool with curved wood deck overlooking the sea. Furniture is not included in the home's asking price, but is negotiable.

The office is fully built out with mounted shelves and dual work stations. The main bedroom beyond has a walk-in closet and en suite bathroom with a tiled soaking tub, both with skylights. The staircase ascends to a bedroom that accesses a large roof terrace and has an en suite bath. The kitchen has a skylight, marble countertops and a walk-in cooler with a Danish refrigeration unit useful for wine storage, said Robert Bartikoski, the broker-owner of Re/Max Paradise Homes Bonaire, a local partner of 7th Heaven Properties that also has the listing. Beyond the kitchen are storage and laundry rooms, as well as a patio leading to the studio apartment. An addition to that wing of the house includes a two-car garage with a bedroom suite above. The villa has air-conditioning, security cameras and a water storage tank.

Sabadeco Terrace is about five miles north of Kralendijk, a small coastal city with a few thousand residents and a strip of shops, supermarkets, restaurants and other amenities, Mr. Bartikoski said. The 111-square-mile island of Bonaire is a magnet for scuba divers, but also attracts wind surfers to Lac Bay and kite surfers to Atlantis Beach. Pink Beach, on the island's southwestern shore, and Washington-Slagbaai National Park, on its northern tip, are each less than 20 minutes away by car. Bonaire International Airport is a 15-minute drive. The Dutch island of Bonaire, with about 21,000 residents, has long attracted outsiders with its arid climate, coral reefs and relatively low risk of hurricanes. In recent years, its largely tourism-based economy has generated a flourishing real estate market, and not unlike many other tropical locales, its allure seems to have grown during the coronavirus pandemic. ""The outbreak of the pandemic has only enhanced the island's appeal,"" Mr. Cooper said. ""We've seen a steady rise in inquiries this year, including a huge surge the day after the U.S. election."" According to Bonaire's most recent official data, reported by Statistics Netherlands in 2018, the housing index showed prices for residential properties were on average 21.6 percent higher than they were the previous year. The number of housing transactions from 2017 to 2018 grew by 52.8 percent, from 214 to 327. Official data for 2019 is not available, but real estate experts said the market has continued apace. ""It's been insane,"" said Roderick Groenman, a notary with the office of Aniek H. Schouten. ""For the past three or four years, things have been going really well."" Mr. Groenman attributed the consistent growth to the island's status as a special municipality of the Netherlands, which provides free, high-quality health care to residents. (Aruba and Curacao, by contrast, are autonomous constituent countries of the Netherlands.) He also pointed to Bonaire's stability on the U.S. dollar, which the island adopted as its currency in 2011. The economy has been expanding, with a 3.9 percent increase in the gross domestic product in 2018, and this year the Dutch government has provided subsidies to thwart an economic downturn.

""If you compare Bonaire to the islands around us, like Aruba or Curacao, or even Trinidad and Tobago, we have a big plus on the surrounding islands because we're part of Holland, and have a strong currency and room for economic growth,"" Mr. Groenman said. After closing to international travel in the spring, Bonaire resumed flights to and from Europe on July 1, followed by flights to and from Curacao on Oct. 26, according to the U.S. Consulate General in Curacao. (There has been no announcement about when direct flights to and from the U.S. will resume.) As of Nov. 6, Bonaire had reported 135 confirmed cases of Covid-19. The housing market ""did slow down for a little while, but we continued to have Dutch visitors through the summer, and they were buying,"" Mr. Bartikoski said. ""And we have 3-D tours online, so we've had Americans buying over the internet. We really haven't seen a dip in prices."" While resale homes run about $111 to $139 a square foot, not including the land, new construction can run to $130 a square foot or more, he said. There are luxury villas on the island priced between $1 million and $10 million, he said, along with many more reasonably priced options. ""You can find a nice two-bedroom, two-bath oceanfront condo for between $400,000 and $550,000,"" he said. ""Non-oceanfront condos start around $250,000 and go up.""","On the Dutch island of Bonaire, foreign buyers are lured by good health care, an arid climate and an economy built on the U.S. dollar.",855dd46a-3d28-5244-9b4a-3684f62f9d72,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/11/realestate/11IHH-BONAIRE-slide-B4W7/11IHH-BONAIRE-slide-B4W7-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=aebeff9e86d8a326abf499292183b5669ad4ba50220f4dd66859409206296425&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The property, on about two-thirds of an acre, overlooks the Caribbean Sea from the hillside neighborhood of Sabadeco Terrace, on the west coast of Bonaire.",855dd46a-3d28-5244-9b4a-3684f62f9d72,N24News/imgs/855dd46a-3d28-5244-9b4a-3684f62f9d72.jpg,7
Theater,Review: A Catalog of America's Problems in 'Awake',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/theater/review-awake-barrow-group.html,"Racism, homophobia, sexism, police violence, immigration: All of these issues come up in ""Awake."" It would be a lot for any one play -- but ""Awake"" has nine of them, each clocking in at around 10 or 15 minutes. To its credit, the show, written and directed by K. Lorrel Manning at the Barrow Group, moves at a steady clip. After all, the best thing about an anthology is that if an individual play isn't very good, it also won't be very long. Then again, these are not so much plays as vignettes. There is no time to get attached to any of the characters, or to let the situations blossom in a dramatically impactful manner. Setup, red herring, reveal, punch line: over and out.

In ""Carlos, the Protector,"" for instance, the protagonist is a cop (Jose Eduardo Ramos) who recounts the fast decision he had to make in a difficult, tense situation. The moral of the story is the moral of every story here: It's complicated. In ""The 'N' Connection,"" an interracial couple (Michael Giese and Madeleine Mfuru) argue over who has the right to say a specific epithet and whether there is such a thing as reverse racism. In ""Saving Souls,"" a teacher (Julia Ryan) summons the mother (Nelly Savinon) of a little boy whose report on Hitler raised hackles among students and parents. The boy is an excellent student at a charter school -- and the only Latino in his class -- and it's all ... complicated.

Mr. Manning take pains to show the many sides of an issue and can't be accused of hardened didacticism, but his efforts to be evenhanded can err on the side of safety and often sap the show's energy. An exception is ""The Date,"" the only entry flirting with satire and the only one to feature an obvious villain, so caricatural as to be a refreshingly obvious pinata for ""woke"" theatergoers. Martin (Garen McRoberts), is a cocky corporate bro who can't stand what he perceives as affirmative action. This peach of a guy complains to his dinner date, Susan (Anna Russell), about a certain Jamal being hired over a certain Tommy. When pressed, Martin admits that Jamal is doing just fine at his job ""but that's not the point."" (You have to wonder why it took the reasonable Susan four dates to realize what a colossal jerk Martin is -- anybody with functioning ears would have gotten that message in seconds.)

The show is essentially an earnest prompter for conversations or school discussions. Audience members are even given cards on which they can write down impressions, thoughts or questions before pinning them on an ""experience wall"" in the theater's lobby. What may linger most, however, is not a provocative idea (there are none) but some of the performances. In ""A & J Rule the Universe,"" for example, Vinny Baierlein and Trey Santiago-Hudson portray disaffected teenagers munching on fast-food fries and shooting the breeze as they drive around -- not as aimlessly as you might think at first. Mr. Baierlein and Mr. Santiago-Hudson effectively paint outside of the rough outline they've been given. These characters' lives may be in stasis, but those few minutes in their company go fast.","K.

Theater,Review: A Secret History of Gay Life Uncovered in '217 Boxes',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/06/theater/review-217-boxes-of-dr-henry-anonymous.html,"The sailors don't show up for Fleet Week until the end of the month, but right now we've got the shrinks. Yes, the American Psychiatric Association is in town; you may have noticed the gangs of tweedy, chin-stroking men and women wandering the side streets in search of discounted Eames lounge chairs. If they are drama minded, they already know about Ain Gordon's ""217 Boxes of Dr. Henry Anonymous,"" which opened on Thursday at the Baryshnikov Arts Center in conjunction with their 2018 annual meeting. It is, after all, a play about a psychiatrist -- and not only that, but a psychiatrist who made history at an earlier annual meeting, in Dallas. It was there, in 1972, that Dr. John Fryer, wearing a joke-store rubber mask and an oversized tuxedo, with his voice altered through a distorting microphone to disguise his identity, began a brief speech to his colleagues by saying, ""I am a homosexual."" A year later, the organization's pernicious diagnosis of homosexuality as a mental disorder -- a diagnosis that had harmed innumerable men and women, and made Fryer fear that using his own name would ruin him -- was stricken from the psychiatric bible. Mr. Gordon's play, which he also directed, does not try to explain how things moved so fast. (Much more was involved than Fryer's testimony.) Nor is it the kind of self-congratulatory uplift you might expect to find on the program at a convention. Rather, ""217 Boxes"" is an important work of documentary theater about a man who is a footnote to gay history, as well as a powerfully moving abstract of the decades of suffering and change that his life and attachments encompassed.

I use the word ""abstract"" advisedly. Mr. Gordon is a three-time Obie award winner who often focuses on the ""also pictured"" characters at the edge of photographs and fame. Even within that aesthetic, ""217 Boxes"" is unusually indirect and conceptual. Fryer himself does not appear in this play named for him except in projections behind the set, and mostly in the hideous disguise that paradoxically brought him his moment of notoriety. Instead of Fryer what we mostly see are the gray, flip-top archival boxes from which the play draws its title. Arranged in piles and lanes to form a kind of graveyard, they represent similar boxes housed at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, which acquired Fryer's papers upon his death in 2003. There, as part of a project called An Artist Embedded, Mr. Gordon immersed himself in Fryer's notes, letters, diaries and other documents, eventually extracting three characters from them: three lives lived at tangents to Fryer's that together triangulated him and his times.

Footnotes to a footnote, they nevertheless become, in a series of beautifully shaped 25-minute monologues, avatars of gayness in America during the whole of the 20th century. This even though only the first is gay: Alfred A. Gross, a ""high-swish"" pre-Stonewall homosexual (he was born in 1895) who sought Fryer's professional help in assisting ""men like himself"" when they got into trouble with the law. A self-described warrior for his people (""Well, warrior behind the drapes""), Gross (Derek Lucci) attests to the terrible oppression of the closet but also to its compensations: ""May I be a little understood for reveling in how that oppression did also make me spectacular?"" he asks. Mr. Lucci gives Gross immense dignity without shrinking at all from his flamboyance; he italicizes italics and turns sibilance into music.

The second ghost from the archives is Katherine M. Luder, who, starting at age 67 and continuing until her death 24 years later, was Fryer's secretary and something more. (""The doctor and myself were a little, intensely, utterly platonically, very married,"" she says with typical tartness. ""Ha, chew on that."") Luder recapitulates in her relationship with Fryer the arc of the world's growing acknowledgment, toleration and embrace of gay people, or at least a quicker form of it. She also connects the dots to feminism, ageism and, most powerfully, AIDS, which she came to comprehend as Fryer's young patients showed up for appointments in ever more ill-fitting clothes. In what is perhaps the play's highlight, Luder, played by Laura Esterman, a New York stage treasure who has never been better, memorializes those patients, whose names she of course can't divulge, in a way that is no less concrete for being totally abstract. That's the play's method, too, coming at us with its cool cred thrust out like a business card but still, when you shake its hand, warm to the touch. By the final monologue, in which Ken Marks plays Fryer's father, Ercel, Mr. Gordon risks even sentimentality. In reality, Ercel died, at home in Kentucky, two years before his son's momentous speech; it's the play that gives him posthumous knowledge of it. And this too: Though he still has trouble saying the word ""homosexual,"" Ercel wants us to know he is proud that he signed all nine letters he wrote to his son -- they're in the boxes -- ""Love, Daddy."" From where I sat among the psychiatrists, that bit of schmaltz, beautifully tempered in Mr. Marks's performance, paid off. It pays off because ""217 Boxes"" tells us something real about the world whether or not its version of Fryer's colleagues and family is as accurate as the archive from which their stories are drawn. Liberation, the play demonstrates, is not just necessary and beneficial to the oppressed but also to society as a whole. ""This is the greatest loss, our honest humanity,"" Fryer said on that hot Dallas day in 1972, ""and that loss leads all those others around us to lose that little bit of their humanity as well."" That he said this while sweating behind a rubber mask does not make it any less true. And that ""217 Boxes"" turns it into something moving does not make it any less fine.",Ain Gordon's new play tells a powerful story of gay life in America from the unusual point of view of a psychiatrist most famous for wearing a mask.,1c1cb3ff-61ce-5ec6-8e84-80d9a89e34e9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/08/arts/08drhenryanonymous/07drhenryanonymous-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=46f128b6babf0506a4b16a1ffceeb1ddd16099798102f50c03906bd043d69b76&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Derek Lucci in &ldquo;217 Boxes of Dr. Henry Anonymous&rdquo; at the Baryshnikov Arts Center in Manhattan.,1c1cb3ff-61ce-5ec6-8e84-80d9a89e34e9,N24News/imgs/1c1cb3ff-61ce-5ec6-8e84-80d9a89e34e9.jpg,10
Opinion,Sephora Never Valued Workers Like Me,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/opinion/sephora-layoffs-coronavirus.html,"HOUSTON -- In late March, I was suddenly laid off from my job at Sephora, where I'd worked part time for almost two years. The announcement came out of nowhere. A couple of days before, the company said it would take care of us during the coronavirus crisis, and I believed it. Our stores shut down, but the company started Sephora at Home and asked us to watch videos on new brands so we'd be ready to help people shop online. When corporate announced on a conference call that thousands of part time and seasonal workers were unemployed, it felt like we were cattle led to slaughter. I liked working at Sephora. I've been writing blog posts about fashion and makeup for years, and I love interacting with customers. I liked how our managers would check in with us about our goals for advancing in the company, and that people in school could get help with college tuition. I never really questioned the things that felt unfair in my job. I thought if I worked hard and was flexible, eventually I'd get to full time and better wages. Now I realize I was just drinking the corporate Kool-Aid.

There are so many part-time workers in retailing, and we've always had second-class status, with more unstable schedules and no benefits. Like a third of the hourly workers in the service sector, I was stuck with part-time work even though I wanted more hours. The kinds of people who are most likely to be underemployed are Latinas, people paid hourly, people with variable work schedules, people working in sales and retailing and people with low household incomes -- all of which describe me. And those of us stuck in part-time jobs are paid 30 percent less per hour than full-timers doing the same thing. That means we face a double penalty: not enough hours, and lower pay for each hour we do work. No wonder I had zero savings when I lost my job. The times and lengths of my shifts changed all the time, and sometimes we got our schedules only two days before the week started. I needed as many hours as I could get, so I would always pick up shifts if my co-workers were unavailable. Sometimes I'd work close to 40 hours, but then I'd be cut back, because the manager would get in trouble with corporate if I got too close to full time. During my time at Sephora, I had several conversations with my manager about how I could get promoted to full time, and I was told it would happen. But now I think I was just being promised something I was never going to get. I was hired as a cashier, and my manager told me that I was ""99 percent ready"" to be a lead cashier, but then she hired someone else. I worked pretty often in ""color matching,"" which is helping customers select the right shades of makeup for their skin tone. I was earning $13 an hour, my cashier rate, even when I worked in color matching. I believe my full time co-workers with that job make $15 or $16 per hour, but I'm not sure because the company discouraged us from talking about our wages. One day I got so frustrated I started crying, because I was doing all the work without the benefits that color consultants get, like training and free products.

And even though I was putting my personal life on hold to come in whenever I was called, that flexibility flowed in only one direction. Once, my car tire blew out and my manager made me feel terrible about calling out, even though I had no way to get to work. Since I had no health benefits or paid time off, I worked when I was unwell. I earned too much money for Medicaid. I have a thyroid condition, which causes a lot of fatigue. And I have really irregular menstruation but haven't been able to see an obstetrician-gynecologist. When things got really bad, I'd go to the emergency room and ask the hospital to bill me later. During the holiday season, I picked up a seasonal job at Target to help make ends meet. But it didn't help much. Without consistent hours, it's hard to maintain two jobs. Target wasn't willing to schedule me around my hours at Sephora, and Sephora gave me a hard time for limiting my availability. Then the Target job ended, and Sephora was really slow starting in January. Some weeks I was scheduled for just one shift. I would beg my bosses to call me if anyone called out. By the time the coronavirus hit, I was behind on my bills and afraid my car would get repossessed. Sephora offered us one week of severance, but because my hours had been limited, it was only $278. And when I read the fine print, it seemed the money was offered to buy our silence. If I signed it, I couldn't say anything about how Sephora treated me and other part-time workers, and that didn't sit right with me. So I didn't. I have been on the phone with every company I owe money to, trying to get some extensions and payment plans. I now have SNAP benefits, but I've been calling the unemployment office for more than a month and can't get through. I wake up at 7 each morning and call all day. It feels like a job I'm not getting paid for. When I try to apply online, I hit problems. Texas allows employers to submit unemployment claims on behalf of all their laid-off workers, and it would be nice if Sephora handled that for us. I deserve more than a part-time job where I scramble with unpredictable hours and get tossed aside with no warning. I don't know what the economy will look like when the pandemic is over, but I know we can't go back to the way things were.","I was an ideal employee, but the company treated me terribly, even before it laid me off amid the coronavirus crisis.",7e034c9b-d3c0-5668-85ff-fd9d59f11c9f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/17/opinion/17moyaWEb/17moyaWEb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=6bd8ddf4bba2c31a27d475b93cf91ce43678846461f1680d9bbc38d8e7d69352&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Violet Moya on Thursday near her home in Houston.,7e034c9b-d3c0-5668-85ff-fd9d59f11c9f,N24News/imgs/7e034c9b-d3c0-5668-85ff-fd9d59f11c9f.jpg,11
Music,"On 'The New Abnormal,' the Strokes Flip Nostalgia Toward the Future",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/arts/music/the-strokes-the-new-abnormal-review.html,"Nostalgia has long been part of the Strokes's narrative, but the band's true commitment is to counterpoint: to putting interlocking melody at every level of a song.

Even when the Strokes were a brand-new band, nostalgia was a big part of their appeal. ""In many ways, they'll miss the good old days/Someday,"" Julian Casablancas sang on ""Someday"" from the Strokes's 2001 debut album, ""Is This It."" At the time, the Strokes were already being hailed as a second -- maybe third or fourth -- coming of a terse, hardheaded, jaded but hopped-up New York City rock lineage running from the Velvet Underground through the New York Dolls and the Ramones. Now, 19 years after the Strokes released their first recordings and seven years after their previous full-length album, ""Comedown Machine,"" the band has released ""The New Abnormal."" (They announced the album title in early February, weeks before ""the new abnormal"" became a familiar description of life during the Covid-19 pandemic.) It's the sixth album by the Strokes, always a supremely self-conscious band. And as the band completes its second decade, its invocations of nostalgia have folded in on themselves: on the music the Strokes chose as their foundation, on two decades of the Strokes's own catalog and on the conflicting pressures of enjoying flexing their strongest instincts and moving ahead. ""I want new friends but they don't want me,"" Casablancas complains, resignedly, in ""Brooklyn Bridge to Chorus.""

The Strokes have the boon and burden of making three indelible albums: ""Is This It"" (2001), ""Room on Fire"" (2003) and -- though it was less appreciated at the time -- ""First Impressions on Earth"" (2005), which bristles equally with guitar hooks and misanthropic barbs. The next two albums, and the 2016 EP ""Future Present Past"" (note the title), turned inward and grew opaque; band members also took time for solo projects. But the early Strokes albums built lasting loyalty, particularly in New York; the Strokes were headliners at Governors Ball in 2014 and 2016, and on New Year's Eve 2019 at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.

""The New Abnormal"" was produced by Rick Rubin, who in recent decades has become known as someone that established acts -- Metallica, the Dixie Chicks, Red Hot Chili Peppers -- go to for a midcareer reckoning, a reconsideration of a band's essence as it grows up. ""The New Abnormal"" clarifies what had already become increasingly obvious: that the Strokes never intended to reincarnate punk, garage rock or proto-punk. Brevity was fine, but the primitivist blare and blur of punk were by no means what the Strokes were after. The band's true commitment is to counterpoint: to putting interlocking melody at every level of a song. The guitars of Nick Valensi and Albert Hammond Jr. are in constant dialogue, separated in stereo with contrasting tones, while Nikolai Fraiture's bass offers as much countermelody as impact; Fabrizio Moretti's drums goad and answer them all but leave space. The instruments lean toward brief, staccato parts, simultaneously pacing and pulling against sustained melodies from Casablancas. Even on lesser Strokes albums, the musical ideas always snap neatly into place. The Strokes announced the title for their sixth album, ""The New Abnormal,"" in early February. On ""The New Abnormal,"" tempos are often slower than they were on early Strokes songs, which only exposes more of the songs' intricacies. At any speed, Strokes tracks are clockworks, not tantrums or squalls. And they haven't gotten lazy; the album opens with ""The Adults Are Talking"" in perky, vintage Strokes style, with guitars picking steady eighth-notes, bouncing back and forth, stacking up little lines that mesh crisply or tease with dissonance.

""The '80s bands, where did they go?,"" Casablancas sings in ""Brooklyn Bridge to Chorus,"" simultaneously acknowledging influences and musing on the half-lives of pop careers. Throughout ""The New Abnormal,"" the band summons the full-bodied sounds of the 1980s, with spacious guitar tones and what may or may not be blippy electropop synthesizers (Valensi has ways of drawing synthesizer-like tones from his guitars). One song, ""Bad Decisions,"" harks back to Billy Idol's ""Dancing With Myself,"" sharing the songwriting credits with Idol and his collaborator Tony James. It's the Strokes admitting that they, too, had some not-so-hip formative years. ""The New Abnormal"" has the Strokes thinking in the long term not only about pop careers but about relationships, even the state of the environment. Casablancas remains skeptical of just about everyone, definitely including himself. In ""Why Are Sundays So Depressing"" he warns, ""Don't ask me questions/that you don't want/the answers to."" But he's no longer petulant or dismissive. In a few songs he's even apologetic, particularly in ""Selfless,"" which could easily be a marriage proposal. There's a broader view in ""Eternal Summer,"" a majestic march that warns bitterly about climate change. ""Summer is coming, won't go away,"" Casablancas croons in falsetto; later, he brings a punky rasp to snarl, ""They got the remedy/But they won't let it happen."" ""At the Door"" is the album's most radical departure from the typical Strokes sound. There are no drums; the music gets its pulse from rhythmic synthesizer tones and rippling guitar chords, and near the end the parts multiply into an overarching neo-Baroque polyphony of computer-tuned vocals and countermelodies. ""Use me like an oar to get yourself to shore,"" Casablancas offers in a moment of pure benevolence. It's not the early, edgy Strokes, but what they've grown up into. Maybe the Strokes won't make new friends with this album, but old friends can get closer.","The band's sixth album, produced by Rick Rubin, makes clear that the group never intended to reincarnate garage rock or proto-punk.",eca0aa91-b6fa-58f0-b446-4631e57fd359,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/16/arts/13strokes-review1/13strokes-review1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=20f4a5b67768ccd60beea677ba2f984b835fb40f7a7b045f4b6195e92f3169dd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Nostalgia has long been part of the Strokes&rsquo;s narrative, but the band&rsquo;s true commitment is to counterpoint: to putting interlocking melody at every level of a song.",eca0aa91-b6fa-58f0-b446-4631e57fd359,N24News/imgs/eca0aa91-b6fa-58f0-b446-4631e57fd359.jpg,12
Sports,"Under Current Rules, Golf's Most Memorable U.S. Open Playoffs Wouldn't Have Happened",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/sports/golf/us-open-playoff-rules-sudden-death.html,"Since the playing of the first United States Open in 1895, the year after the United States Golf Association was founded, the procedure to settle a tie after regulation play in the tournament was straightforward: a playoff consisted of 18 more holes of golf. The thinking was that only a full round would provide a full and complete examination to determine the champion. Playoffs occur in the U.S. Open more commonly than most realize. Of the 119 played to date, 33 have resulted in playoffs, or about one in every four. Most years, those playoffs followed the original procedure, or some variant of an additional 18 holes. But from 1928 through 1931, playoffs were settled at 36 holes, with the 1931 playoff requiring two additional 36-hole rounds -- a total of 144 holes played -- before the rule was changed back to 18 holes. The procedure was further modified in 1953 to include continuous hole-by-hole play at sudden death until a winner emerged in case of a tie after the initial 18-hole playoff. The last playoff occurred in 2008 at Torrey Pines as Tiger Woods, playing on what turned out to be a cracked femur, won in 19 holes over Rocco Mediate.

In 1913, a 20-year-old former caddie, Francis Ouimet, defeated two of the greatest golfers in the world, the Britons Harry Vardon and Ted Ray, in an 18-hole playoff at the Country Club, outside Boston, transforming golf from a game for the elites to one with populist and diverse appeal. Ouimet's win set off the first big golf boom in America. In 1929, in the first U.S. Open at Winged Foot Golf Club in Westchester County, N.Y., Bobby Jones -- after dissipating a six-stroke lead with just seven holes to play -- made a curling 12-foot putt on the 18th hole to force a tie. He went on to defeat Al Espinosa in a 36-hole playoff by a whopping 23 strokes. Ben Hogan won an 18-hole playoff at Merion Golf Club, near Philadelphia, in 1950, 16 months after a horrific head-on crash with a Greyhound bus that almost crippled him. Red Smith immortalized Hogan's performance, ""Maybe once in the lifetime of any of us it is possible to say with accuracy and without mawkishness, 'This was a spiritual victory, an absolute triumph of will!'"" But in 2018, the U.S.G.A. quietly changed the playoff format to a two-hole aggregate score, with play commencing directly after the conclusion of play on the final day. Sudden death would follow, if necessary.

It was a dramatic, if unheralded, change, and if it had been applied to the hole-by-hole scores of the 33 playoffs played before it, it would have produced drastically different results in 15 of the previous U.S. Open playoffs. Ouimet would have lost to Vardon on the sixth playoff hole in 1913; Jones would have lost to Espinosa on the second hole in 1929; and Hogan would have lost to Lloyd Mangrum on the second playoff hole in 1950.

Some of the biggest triumphs in golf history as we have come to know them would be erased. In justifying the change to the two-hole aggregate playoff structure, Mike Davis, the U.S.G.A. chief executive, has said, ""Golf really in this day and age has gotten to the point where everyone wants to see a Sunday finish."" Jeff Hall, the U.S.G.A.'s managing director of rules, explained the thinking behind the decision to force a finish on the final day: ""We consulted with important constituencies, not the least of which are players. We talked to fans on site and we talked to fans that were taking in the championship through the broadcast; obviously, our television partners are part of that discussion as well. So many people have a vested interest in getting a result on Sunday."" The decision highlights the importance of prime time TV broadcasts, likely a major impetus for the playoff change, which would incur additional costs if the finale went past Sunday. One person with knowledge of the decision who spoke on condition of anonymity said, ""This new playoff method potentially injects a flukiness that's inappropriate for the national championship. Wouldn't it be a shame if a lucky bounce -- or an unlucky one -- determined the winner in a two-hole playoff? Over 18 holes, luck would largely be taken out of the equation."" A retired senior-level U.S.G.A. executive perhaps summed up the new playoff rule best, ""The U.S. Open is supposed to be an arduous exam, not a pop quiz.""","The U.S.G.A. in 2018 quietly changed the Open's playoff format from a full round to a two-hole aggregate score.

Media,Former Fox News Executive Said to Be Considered for White House Job,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/business/media/bill-shine-fox-news-white-house.html,"Bill Shine, a former co-president of Fox News and top lieutenant to the network's founder, Roger Ailes, has spoken with White House officials about taking a position on President Trump's communications team, according to several people briefed on the discussions.

Mr. Shine has no political experience outside of producing cable news, and he was forced out of Fox News in May after his name surfaced in lawsuits that accused him of abetting Mr. Ailes's harassing behavior toward women. (Mr. Shine has denied all wrongdoing, as did Mr. Ailes, who died in May.)

But Mr. Shine has an influential ally in the Fox News host Sean Hannity, an informal adviser to Mr. Trump -- and one of his most loyal on-air supporters -- who dined with Mr. Shine, the president and the first lady at the White House last week.

Mr. Shine's job prospects are unclear now that Mr. Trump has fired his communications director, Anthony Scaramucci, who also attended last week's dinner and worked with Mr. Shine during his tenure as a host on Fox News and the Fox Business Network. Mr. Shine's association with Mr. Scaramucci may hinder his chances with some factions in the West Wing.","Bill Shine, a former co-president of the network and an ally of Sean Hannity, was said to have discussed a position on President Trump's communications team.",ca6e32d8-c77d-51db-9075-85d5fabc51ef,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/02/business/02SHINE1/02SHINE1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=66cc6296b8106d29457d0770019afa70f484377377c1dc80daa8c6e7d1f8688b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Bill Shine after a meeting with Donald J.

Dance,"For 'Pearl,' a 4,200-Gallon River Runs Through the Koch Theater",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/27/arts/dance/for-pearl-a-4200-gallon-river-runs-through-the-koch-theater.html,"Daniel Ezralow may be a champion of dance, but he's not elitist about it. He choreographed the opening ceremony of the Sochi Olympics, Julie Taymor's ""Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark"" and, in February, a version of ""The Rite of Spring"" for the Russian rhythmic gymnastics team at the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg. ""I put the stage in the middle of the audience and surrounded it with people,"" Mr. Ezralow, 58, said of his ""Rite"" in a recent interview. ""I had projections from the top onto the floor. The girls came out of a wheat field. It was a trip."" Mr. Ezralow's latest endeavor seems just as ambitious: ""Pearl,"" a dance-theater spectacle opening at the David H. Koch Theater on Thursday that is based on the life of Pearl S. Buck, the Nobel- and Pulitzer Prize-winning writer. The daughter of missionaries, Buck (1892-1973) grew up in China and is credited with changing American perceptions of that country through her humanizing depictions of peasant life in ""The Good Earth"" and other works. So how do you make a dance show about a writer? As he pointed out, he may be a director and choreographer, but he's not George Balanchine. ""It's a revered place,"" he said of the Koch Theater, which is home to New York City Ballet and was designed to Balanchine's specifications. Since, however, ""Pearl"" is neither a City Ballet piece nor a ballet in the Balanchine tradition, Mr. Ezralow is altering the performance space, by adding that river, for one thing. ""It's one of those ideas that is crazy, but makes sense,"" he said.

Other changes: There are no wings. The stage will be expanded over the orchestra pit, which creates ample space for more than 30 dancers, Chinese and American, including five Pearls played by performers from 7 years old to 62. There are floor-to-ceiling projections and slacklines, or flexible cables, on which the dancers balance. As for the river, it's 150 feet long and six feet wide and uses 4,200 gallons of water. ""I went to Zhenjiang and saw where Pearl Buck lived,"" Mr. Ezralow said. ""It's on the Yangtze River. You realize, how do I ever put something onstage that has any essence of this woman, what she was about and what this river meant to China? It's the divide that Pearl constantly had in her life. It's the river of life. So in a sense, it was everything. It's a protagonist. But I use it delicately. I don't splash a lot."" ""Pearl"" also takes inspiration from an eighth-century Chinese poem, ""Spring, River, Flower, Moon, Night,"" by Zhang Ruoxu. The idea for the production came from Angela Xiaolei Tang, the executive producer, whose desire was to bridge the East and the West through Buck's life and the poem, which evokes the Yangtze riverscape. Her aim, she explained, was to loosely echo the five themes of the poem with the events of Buck's life. ""I did not want to produce a show only about her bio,"" Ms. Tang said.

""The poem is all about the seasons and how life changes,"" he said. ""We come and go, but the rock and the river are still there. It allowed me to be abstract. Dance, if it's not going to be Broadway, has to be."" Buck lived in the United States as an adult; the ""moon"" section reflects her homesickness for China as well as the way her writing reflects out into the world. In that section is a dance in which Buck, portrayed by the Canadian choreographer and dancer Margie Gillis, is suddenly surrounded. ""All the dancers start gravitating to her like magnets,"" Mr. Ezralow said. ""I wanted to show how she could unite."" Ms. Gillis, a fan of Buck since childhood, said her depiction evokes the time in the writer's life when she was examining her legacy. ""As we age, our thinking becomes more global,"" Ms. Gillis said. ""We're more interested in larger pictures, and so it's about that period of life -- her moon, her night."" The only text in the show is two essays by Buck, including ""Roll Away the Stone,"" which Mr. Ezralow sums up as ""extraordinary, positive writing about our humanity and that we have a choice to be conscious and intelligent and respectful."" The cost of the production, which features an original score by the Japanese composer Jun Miyake, is around $4 million; it will tour Europe and China starting early next year. ""It's not like I needed to do something big,"" Mr. Ezralow said. ""I did the Olympics. But this is its own thing. It's very hard for me to define it and say, dance audience, come. Visual audience, come. Film, come. I do this unusual hybrid of many different things that come to me, and I try to be honest with them."" His interest in interpreting Buck's life through dance-theater has less to do with what she left behind -- her books, her essays -- and more with her perpetual curiosity. ""When doors shut we get fearful,"" Mr. Ezralow said. ""Pearl kept those doors open.""","A show's director transforms New York City Ballet's stage by adding a river, expanding over the orchestra pit and dispensing with wings.",b2fc07ff-dde3-508c-a63f-6e8159b27312,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/27/arts/27PERLDANCE1/27PERLDANCE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=fba8adfea0e06db9c61198993595adff9f22092a7025d2e1c42bebbce2c1f7b2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Vanessa Treviño dancing on slacklines for ""Pearl,"" directed by Danny Ezralow.

Real Estate,A Fixer-Upper in Riverdale,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/26/realestate/a-fixer-upper-in-riverdale.html,"Nearly three years ago, Renee Nelson, a high school math teacher at a charter school in the Bronx, moved back to Ossining, N.Y., where she had grown up. Ms. Nelson had been renting an apartment in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, after graduating from Boston University, but she wanted to buy a place of her own, so with her baby son, Naiyim, in tow, she moved back in with her parents to save money. She had her eye on Riverdale, an area that was close to family and work, with good schools and prices she could afford on a budget of up to $270,000. She was hoping for a two-bedroom apartment in a co-op building, with at least a bath and a half, some outdoor space and indoor parking. ""I lived in a house for so long and never got to park in a garage,"" said Ms. Nelson, who is now 33. ""And I hated cleaning off the snow."" (At her parents' house, the driveway was on an incline, and they were constantly shuffling cars to get in and out.)

Last year, she found a three-bedroom in a six-story postwar building on Fieldston Terrace, listed for $245,000. Monthly maintenance was around $1,125. It had outdoor parking and no pool, but those trade-offs seemed reasonable for such a nicely renovated apartment. She offered the asking price, and her offer was accepted. But months passed, while she provided more and more paperwork to the mortgage lender. Eventually, she discovered she could not get a mortgage for the apartment, despite having been preapproved, and the sponsor returned her down payment. ""I was devastated,"" she said. ""It just fell out of my hands. I felt I had really high dreams, or my goal was set too high.""

Most of the other places Ms. Nelson liked cost more than $300,000 or needed renovations. ""It wasn't that I couldn't find the space,"" she said. ""It was the price. There was nothing in my price range."" One townhouse-style complex on Henry Hudson Parkway, Dogwood Close, had a two-bedroom available for $264,000, with maintenance of around $1,150. The attic could be turned into a usable room with the addition of a staircase; an adjacent rooftop could become a private deck; and a second bathroom could be added. But the work involved was simply too much for her. ""I knew I couldn't handle it,"" Ms. Nelson said. ""I just didn't have the expertise to do it well.""

And the other units that she saw in buildings facing Henry Hudson Parkway didn't interest her at all. ""I couldn't live like that,"" she said. ""I wouldn't be able to open my window. It was just so noisy."" Another sponsor unit in the Fieldston Terrace building became available -- an even bigger three-bedroom, for $285,000 -- but after a bidding war, in which Ms. Nelson offered $289,000, it went to an even higher bidder. Then one day, at an open house, she met Chintan Trivedi, the owner of Re/Max in the City in Riverdale, who gave her some valuable advice.

""I told her, 'You have to give something up, like do a renovation or have maybe a smaller second bedroom,' "" Mr. Trivedi said. ""A compromise will have to be made. I said, 'If you tell me exactly what matters, it makes it easier to find the right match.' "" Ms. Nelson, however, was adamant about her need for outdoor space. ""It's so common in Riverdale, so to not have it would bum me out,"" she said. ""I felt like Chintan understood what I was looking for. The balcony thing was a nonnegotiable."" Other agents urged her to ""just take a look"" at apartments without any outdoor space, she said, but ""I didn't even want to see a place without a balcony.""

The two-bedroom Mr. Trivedi took her to see, an estate sale in the South Riverdale area of Spuyten Duyvil, had everything she wanted: not just a balcony, but indoor parking and a pool. The price was $225,000, with maintenance of a little more than $1,000, and $200 a month for a spot in the underground garage. And the drive to school was 15 minutes, compared with her 45-minute drive from Ossining. Still, it was in sorry shape. But by now, she was more open to renovating -- if it was a manageable amount. ""I realized that if I wanted to be in this area, I would have to buy a fixer-upper,"" said Ms. Nelson, who brought in a contractor to estimate the cost. ""I wanted to know, O.K., how am I going to deal with this fixer-upper thing, because I am not very savvy with that.""

The renovations seemed doable. And after Ms. Nelson bought the apartment late last summer, for $215,000, the contractor went to work. The carpet and the many built-ins were removed, the light fixtures were updated and the kitchen and full bathroom were redone. The half-bath will be renovated later, when she can better afford it. The contractor's work took only a month, but Ms. Nelson spent months adding finishing touches, with her father's help. She wasn't living there yet -- Naiyim, now 3, is remaining in the same day care for the whole school year, so the two are still in Ossining -- and as she noted, ""When you don't have the pressure to get things done, you don't make it a priority."" They are enjoying living there on the weekends, though. ""I love how everything is walking distance,"" Ms. Nelson said. ""We can go to the store, the park, the library. I don't need to get in my car to do everything."" And she is counting the days until summer, when they'll be able to use the pool. ""It's just put on your flip-flops and go downstairs,"" she said. ""I'm so looking forward to that.""","Renee Nelson, a high school math teacher in the Bronx, searched for a two-bedroom apartment with some outdoor space and indoor parking.",b3c0a9b9-e9fa-55bd-9a2a-6def2733d404,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/26/realestate/26HUNT-MAIN/26HUNT-MAIN-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=afcfd91e7c492be942027928bad97395bee5846d03aeb869d01459764b9efee8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"THE BUYER After a long search, Renee Nelson came around to the idea of buying a fixer-upper.",b3c0a9b9-e9fa-55bd-9a2a-6def2733d404,N24News/imgs/b3c0a9b9-e9fa-55bd-9a2a-6def2733d404.jpg,7

The lecture didn't make much of an impression on her. ""I didn't want to see the world. I wanted the world to see me. Not until years later when I finally made a commitment to writing, when I was fighting despair, wondering if I had the talent to do what I wanted to do, did those words come back to me. And what I thought was this: I cannot control whether or not I am talented, but I can pay attention. I can make an effort to see.""

Fashion & Style,What a 'Ghostbusters' Online Attack Says About the Digital Age,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/fashion/ghostbusters-internet-attacks.html,"LOS ANGELES -- The rage was immediate. As soon as the Hollywood trades reported that Sony Pictures was going to reboot ""Ghostbusters"" with women in the lead roles, internet trolls tumbled out of their caves to insta-condemn the effort. As with most online nastiness, the face of the outcry was a blank one. Most of the negative comments and social media posts were anonymous, courtesy of peaches like Grungemaster93, GargoylePhlegm and Neanderthal101. Reinventing their beloved 1980s-era comedy? With women busting the ghosts? Not on their watch! Then came James Rolfe. And with him arrived a lesson about the digital age. Mr. Rolfe, whose YouTube channel, Cinemassacre, has 2.1 million subscribers, posted a video last month that takes aim at the new ""Ghostbusters,"" which is set for release on July 15. Looking into the camera, he criticizes the visual effects shown in an early trailer, and, with flashes of anger, condemns Sony for sweeping the 1984 original movie ""under the rug like it didn't happen.""

Mr. Rolfe, 35, advised his followers that Cinemassacre, known for movie and video-game reviews, would be sitting this one out. ""I refuse to watch it,"" he said, sitting with his rimless glasses amid a gumball machine, ""Star Trek"" memorabilia and bookcases stacked with old VHS tapes. With that, the furor around ""Ghostbusters"" had a focal point. His video racked up 737,000 views in its first day, on its way to 1.7 million. Mr. Rolfe, who sometimes posts videos as a character called Angry Video Game Nerd, became a Nerd King among a certain crowd. ""He will almost certainly be on the right side of history"" read a sympathetic article on Heat Street, a libertarian website owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, reflecting the tenor of many of 22,000 comments on the video nonreview. ""This isn't about feminism,"" Danika Lee Massey, a YouTube star known as Comic Book Girl 19, said in a supportive post. ""This is about greed. This is about a bad idea.""

But a lot of people, including a significant number of men, immediately blasted Mr. Rolfe as a jerk, with some of the blowback taking on a very personal tone. ""I keep fixating on his wedding ring,"" the film critic and humorist Eric D. Snider wrote on Twitter. ""Someone MARRIED this man-baby."" (Mr. Snider later deleted his tweet.) Writing about Mr. Rolfe's ""tantrum"" on the website Death and Taxes, part of the SpinMedia empire, Maggie Serota said he looked as if he were ""sitting in a wet diaper."" My swift reaction to Mr. Rolfe's video was similarly severe. Without so much as pressing play, I decided that his position was garbage and that he represented the worst about geek culture and the internet. I considered leaving a hissy comment on his site: Somebody's mom apparently forgot to teach the judging-books-by-their-covers lesson. Instead, I did something very old-fashioned. First, I watched his six-minute video, which surprised me. While not saying much that I agree with, Mr. Rolfe does express his opinions in a rather calm and articulate way. It's not overtly sexist -- though there are whiffs -- and his points are rather tame compared with a lot of the other ""Ghostbusters"" muck online. (Hard stare toward Reddit.) Next, I sent him an email. I wanted to know what he made of the furor. His response was astonishing. He was offended by some of the blowback -- because, as he wrote in an email, it seemed to him that those angry over his video ""have not watched it, or have been misquoting me or twisting my words.""

Mr. Judging Before Seeing was mad because people were judging before seeing. Mr. Rolfe also seemed agitated that the people ripping him apart, some of whom went so far as to threaten his life, had no interest in his complexity as a human being. Yes, he makes a living through sometimes caustic reviews and rants. (A former wedding videographer, Mr. Rolfe sells ads on Cinemassacre.com and on YouTube, where his videos have a cumulative 858 million views.) But he is also a husband and a father; his daughter, Darcy, now a toddler, was injured at birth. ""My good deeds go largely unknown,"" he said in an email. ""I just had a charity event, auctioning items/props/memorabilia from my show."" The auction, which concluded on May 6, raised about $20,000 for Shriners Hospitals for Children. When finally coaxed to the phone, Mr. Rolfe, who works from his East Coast home, did not want to talk about his ""Ghostbusters"" video, saying he thought it spoke for itself, and he didn't want to address the fallout. ""When people attack me, it's always about trying to get a reaction,"" he said. But he did talk about his childhood. As a high school student growing up in New Jersey, Mr. Rolfe said, he was ""extremely shy and didn't have too many friends."" Movies, both the Hollywood kind and the homemade variety, got him through. He used the family camcorder to make horror films, later studying cinema at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, where his junior-year movie was called ""Curse of the Cat Lover's Grave.""","A man whose YouTube channel has 2.1 million subscribers took aim at the new ""Ghostbusters,"" and an online furor followed.",9c68bb99-89c3-5ea2-bf16-8b0560a61548,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/05/fashion/5SCENESTEALERS/5SCENESTEALERS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=40e07d6fc21c57fc22cbd638501951a38d56799c72013ae50fe63822444072d2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The new ""Ghostbusters,"" from left, Melissa McCarthy, Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig and Leslie Jones.",9c68bb99-89c3-5ea2-bf16-8b0560a61548,N24News/imgs/9c68bb99-89c3-5ea2-bf16-8b0560a61548.jpg,19
Opinion,The Wonderful World of Trump Worsts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/opinion/donald-trump.html,"So hey, summer's coming. Time for all Americans to get together and plan how to stay apart. And here's a seasonal question: When we get to Labor Day, who do you think will get the award for Worst Political Person of the Summer? Well, yeah, I knew you'd say him. So negative about our president -- just because he doesn't understand science and recently accused one critic in the media of murder. But Donald Trump can't do everything awful by himself. How about backup nominees? There's Mitch McConnell, of course. And Mike Pompeo, who was slogging through a disastrous year even before Tom Friedman suggested he was the worst secretary of state in all of American history. Among the many Pompeo messes, the most memorable are the allegations that he used a government employee for personal services that included dog-walking and picking up the dry cleaning. Hardly the most significant, but an excellent reminder that this administration has perhaps set a record for cabinet members prone to dumb disasters. Remember the E.P.A. head who sent his aide shopping for a mattress at the Trump hotel?

I want to put a word in here for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who is often unfairly overlooked when it comes to counting terrible people in the current government. This is because of her general ineptitude, and you should thank God every day this woman doesn't know how to get things done. DeVos has focused her career on attempts to direct government money to private schools -- particularly, it seems, bad private schools. Remember when she reformed the whole system in Michigan by making everything worse? Right now, she's battling nefarious attempts to target coronavirus relief funds to the districts that actually need the money most. So many possible Worsts. There's Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex (yes, he's still here) Azar. We've been so busy watching Azar fail to deal with the coronavirus crisis that we totally lost track of the fact that he never did do anything about prescription drug prices. There's Ron DeSantis of Florida, who keeps claiming a Worst Governor award for his out-of-control policy on beach access. We suspected something like this was coming when he declared professional wrestling was an essential state industry. But it's sort of hard to focus on the supporting cast when the big boss has been so off-the-wall. Do you think Trump's refusal to wear a mask is an attempt to woo the political right, or deny the reality of our current health crisis? Or just a sign he doesn't think it's attractive?

I'd go for the most superficial explanation. The president always prioritizes the way things look, even though he personally winds up making the worst possible choices in everything from tanning makeup to leisure wear. And obviously none of his friends have hinted that those golfing photos aren't all that flattering. What about Joe Biden? He hasn't been the worst at much -- some Democrats would be happy to see him do anything that aggressive. But he did come up with what may turn out to be the Worst Political Nickname of the Summer, when he announced he'd refer to Donald Trump as ""President Tweety."" Does that sound like a good plan to you? When I think of ""Tweety"" I think about that yellow canary in old cartoons who kept saying ""I tawt I taw a puddy tat."" Not exactly flattering, but a lot less damaging than, say, President Pandemic. Meanwhile, Trump keeps calling Biden ""Sleepy Joe."" Now this is the election that's going to have you awash in rage and terror for the next five months. But if you think of it as Sleepy Joe versus a canary it sounds pretty darned relaxing. When all else fails, Republicans just claim Biden is best friends with China. Waiting for news on the spaceship launch, the Republican National Committee did manage to send out an attack on Biden for wanting to work with what it called ""the United States' greatest space adversary, China."" Trump's new press secretary, Kayleigh (""I will never lie to you"") McEnany, claimed the administration now has a ""relationship of disappointment and frustration"" with China that's ""put American lives at risk."" She's only been on the job a few weeks, but she's definitely a potential contender in Worst contests of the future. The other day she volunteered that Trump was possibly ""the best president this country will ever have."" Just a quick break here. Do you think historians will rate Donald Trump as better than Abraham Lincoln? Certainly Trump does. He's always suggesting that. (""You know, a poll just came out that I am the most popular person in the history of the Republican Party. ... I beat our Honest Abe."") Of course, in the real world he's way closer to the race for the bottom and he's edging out some tough competition. There was Warren Harding, but Harding was pretty good on social issues like race. Richard Nixon knew a lot about foreign affairs. Franklin Pierce failed to head off the Civil War, but he definitely would have looked better on a golf course.

Style,The Rich Are Planning to Leave This Wretched Planet,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/09/style/axiom-space-travel.html,"HOUSTON -- In an era in which privileged individuals search constantly for the next experience to obsess over and post about on social media, space truly remains the final frontier, a luxury that only the one percent of the one percent can afford. Brad Pitt and Katy Perry are among those who have reportedly plunked down $250,000 for a ride on one of Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic spaceships, undaunted by a 2014 test flight that crashed and killed one pilot. Now a company called Axiom Space is giving those with piles of money and an adventuresome spirit something new to lust after: the prospect of an eight-day trip to space that is plush, if not entirely comfortable, and with a bit of the luster of NASA as well. Circumambulating the floor of his gray carpeted office on a recent Wednesday, Mike Suffredini -- NASA veteran, Houston native and the chief executive officer of Axiom Space -- stopped in front of a wood compartment about as big as a telephone booth.

""It"" was an early mock-up of a cabin that will reside inside a commercial space station, among the first of its kind, that Axiom is building: a mash-up of boutique hotel, adult space camp, and NASA-grade research facility designed to hover approximately 250 miles above the earth. Axiom hired Philippe Starck, the French designer who has lent panache to everything from high-end hotel rooms to mass-market baby monitors, to outfit the interior of its cabins. Mr. Starck lined the walls with a padded, quilted, cream-colored, suede-like fabric and hundreds of tiny LED lights that glow in varying hues depending on the time of day and where the space station is floating in relation to the earth. ""My vision is to create a comfortable egg, friendly, where walls are so soft and in harmony with the movements of the human body in zero gravity,"" Mr. Starck wrote in an email, calling his intended effect ""a first approach to infinity. The traveler should physically and mentally feel his or her action of floating in the universe."" Brace for the rise of the cosmos-scenti. At NASA, Mr. Suffredini spent a decade managing the International Space Station, the hulking, 20-year-old research facility in low Earth orbit. This gives him a certain edge over Mr. Branson and Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, who is overseeing Blue Origin. (The majority of Axiom's 60 employees also hail from NASA.) At least Mr. Suffredini thinks so. ""The guys who are doing Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic are going to the edge of space -- they're not going into orbit,"" he said. ""What they're doing is a cool experience. It gives you about 15 minutes of microgravity and you see the curvature of the earth, but you don't get the same experience that you get from viewing the earth from above, and spending time reflecting, contemplating.""

But the Cost! And the Claustrophobia! The Starck-designed station will supposedly open in 2022, but Axiom says they can start sending curious travelers into orbit as early as 2020. (Note: nearly everything space-related is delayed by years, sometimes decades.) They'll just have to make do with the comparatively rugged accommodations of the International Space Station, which is working with Axiom in addition to other commercial space station outfits. Axiom's station can house eight passengers, including a professional astronaut. Each will pay $55 million for the adventure, which includes 15 weeks of training, much of it at the Johnson Space Center, a 10-minute drive from Axiom's headquarters, and possibly a trip on one of Elon Musk's SpaceX rockets. Thus far, three entities have signed up for on-the-ground training, which starts at $1 million, Mr. Suffredini said, though he declined to name them. The inaugural trip will be only $50 million. ""It's a bargain!"" he said. ""The lion's share of the cost comes from the flight up and down,"" Mr. Suffredini went on. ""Rocket rides are expensive. You know people"" -- meaning competitors -- ""don't know what they're talking about if they're quoting prices substantially less than what we're stating."" In the land rush to space, as it were, Aurora Station, a luxury space hotel being built by Orion Span, another Houston-based aerospace company, announced in April that it would charge $9.5 million per passenger for a 12-day trip, but did not mention the cost of the rocket ride there and back. (Meanwhile, NanoRacks says they'll build space ""outposts"" from spent rocket stages and will create ""near space"" habitats, including for tourism, and Bigelow Aerospace says they're putting big inflatable space pods into orbit, though tourism isn't their focus.)

Phil Larson, a former space policy adviser to President Barack Obama who also worked for SpaceX, doesn't expect travel prices to drop dramatically in the next few years. ""These habitat and outpost companies are great, but we need to solve the launch cost and transportation problem,"" said Mr. Larson . ""It's like the biggest elephant in the room nobody talks about."" The barriers to entry, beyond cost? Being 21 or older -- there's no age cap -- and passing a medical exam, administered before the rest of training begins, as well as ""The Right Stuff""-like tests of mind and mettle, like a spin in a human centrifuge (even the YouTube videos are hard to stomach ). ""Not only do you experience the Gs, you get put into a can that's really -- I mean, if you're going to be a little claustrophobic, this is where you're going to feel it,"" said Mr. Suffredini. ""About half the people that fly get sick for the first two or three days. Going with us for eight days gives you a chance to get over that. If you don't get sick, you have all this time!"" Axiom guests will be required to wear a NASA-grade spacesuit for the rocket ride to and from the station. (Features include a fiberglass torso and a drink tube for consuming small sips of water. Also, a diaper.) Years after Pierre Cardin, Paco Rabanne and Andre Courreges envisioned space-age fashion, Axiom is also in talks with a high-end European fashion house it also declined to name about custom-designing leisure suits travelers can wear once they dock. ""They will be tailored to each person and can be customized with their own logo, if they want,"" Ms. Rein said ""It's a very special keepsake and part of their luxury experience.""

To understand the grand scale of Axiom's plans, it helps to know that astronauts have, thus far, largely been roughing it up there. The Johnson Space Center contains a life-size mock-up of the ISS, whose drab, beige interior is lined with drab, gray handholds to tether down things and people, necessary given the lack of gravity. A tour guide quaintly referred to the onboard bathroom as a ""potty."" There are no showers. ""The few folks that have gone to orbit as tourists, it wasn't really a luxurious experience, it was kind of like camping,"" said Mr. Suffredini. The Axiom station will still have hand holds, but thanks to Mr. Starck (who Mr. Suffredini hadn't heard of before Axiom's branding consultant suggested they hire him) they will be plated in gold or wrapped in buttery leather, like the steering wheel of a Mercedes. Axiom's private cabins will have screens for Netflixing and chilling -- there's not a lot to do up there, although going outside to do a spacewalk is a possibility -- and there will be a great, glass-walled cupola to gather with travelers and take in a more panoramic view of the earth, perhaps with an adult beverage.

Mr. Suffredini's professional life has revolved around space. ""I was like everybody who watched Neil Armstrong walk on the moon and decided that NASA was cool and wanted to work there,"" he said. But while he's overseen many missions, he hasn't been in orbit and has no plans to see Axiom for himself. (""We'd have to work out who's going to cover my cost,"" he demurred, when asked.) Still, Mr. Suffredini sees Axiom as a necessary step in continuing scientific research and development in space, which he believes is crucial to the survival of our species. His company may cater to rich thrill seekers, but he insists he is an idealist. ""If you just go visit and come back, you're not pioneering,"" he said. ""You've got to pioneer."" Pioneers include countries who have yet to send someone to space (a German organization seeking to get that country's first female astronaut in orbit is in talks with Axiom), material-science researchers, and biologists trying to understand how the human body adapts outside earth's atmosphere. Also, maybe, Tupperware. ""They're interested in working with us,"" Mr. Suffredini said, ""testing different types of containers, seeing how you can cook in them in a sort of clean way. But with this idea, this grand idea that we have, comes cleaning dishes and cleaning a microwave, and who wants to do that? Pretty soon we're going to be flying a butler with every crew.""","Here comes private space travel — with cocktails, retro-futuristic Philippe Starck designs and Wi-Fi.

Your Money,"In Estate Planning, Family Isn't Always First",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/03/your-money/in-estate-planning-family-isnt-always-first.html,"WHETHER it's treasured pearl earrings or a vintage camera, a house or what's left of your life savings, deciding who should inherit your worldly goods means making sometimes wrenching choices. For older people without children, stepchildren or grandchildren, the decision can be even more complex. The need to create a trust or focus on planned giving is a generational shift, says Bob Carter, chairman of the board of the Association of Fundraising Professionals. ""Our family didn't think of anything but leaving everything to us. The concept of estate planning didn't exist in my parents' lives,"" said Mr. Carter, who has 40 years' experience as a consultant in philanthropy and fund-raising. Today, with smaller families and more women choosing not to have children, ""the dynamic has changed pretty significantly for the generation of baby boomers. The option of doing something charitably significant with their estates is a change,"" he said.

""This situation is more and more prevalent,"" agrees Kevin Pickett, executive director of development at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. ""Many people come to us to make a donation as a life stage decision,"" Mr. Pickett adds. ""They've had a cancer diagnosis, or a friend or family member has. A retirement, divorce or new job can also prompt people to reflect on their legacy. What are we going to do with all this stuff we've accumulated in our lifetime?"" The decision-making process should begin with some philosophical questions, said Isabel Miranda, a partner in the Bloomfield, N.J., law firm Pearlman & Miranda. Ms. Miranda, a former bank trust officer, now specializes in helping clients plan their wills, trusts and estates. ""Who do I owe my success to? What values do I want to reflect? How do I want to pay back the organizations I believe in?"" she said. For Patty Bennett-Uffelman, who retired to Charleston, S.C., at 45 after selling her software business, it means planned gifts to the same organizations and institutions to which she now donates.

""We're splitting our estate. Fifty percent will go to our grandniece, with a bit to my sisters if they need it, and the other 50 percent will go to five or six charities,"" says Ms. Bennett-Uffelman, who is now 64. These include Planned Parenthood and the Nature Conservancy. ""I've looked for organizations that act, that work on the front end of problems, not the back end."" She suggests paying close attention to a few charities, developing relationships with them and watching how they handle their funds over a number of years and your donations before making any final decisions. ""What sort of communications do they send you? If you increase your gift, how do they handle that?"" For Lee C. Olsen, an architect in Reading, Pa., the decision was easy. He and his wife will leave their assets to the Caron Foundation, a local drug and alcohol rehabilitation center, to endow a scholarship for patients who could not otherwise afford treatment. Their gift also includes artwork worth $25,000 to $35,000. Mr. Olsen knows the organization well, having sat on its board for seven years and having served as its corporate director of facilities for four years. But his choice is also deeply personal: ""It saved my life."" A former alcoholic, he spent 28 days there in 1983 and 1984. In gratitude, he and his wife created the general scholarship fund, without their names on it. ""We know what we've done, and that's important,"" he says. Even those who do have children may decide to leave their estate to others. Mr. Carter said: ""My wife and I are planning to give everything away. My kids are O.K."" Too often, he says, anticipating inherited wealth creates fighting within the family or can kill or inhibit adult children's ambitions. For some gay couples without children, creating a legacy is essential, both emotionally and practically.

""As a gay man, we were just wired for philanthropy because that's what would save us and our friends' lives,"" says Greg Albright, a fund-raiser in Washington. ""In the 1980s and 1990s, that was where all our money went."" Today, Mr. Albright and his husband have focused their current and future giving on two important values -- opportunity and equality -- and have created and raised funds for a local literacy program for low-income children, the Sitar Arts Center. The after-school program now offers more than 70 courses. They wrote a will 13 years ago, prompted by an overseas trip, and updated it when then they married three years ago. ""We've added some organizations and taken some away,"" he says. ""We're very generous people when we're alive and we want to have a more impactful gift when we don't need it any longer."" In addition to a favorite charity, religious institution or alma mater, bequests can also include neighbors, colleagues, former students, friends and relatives. ""I call them 'families of affinity,' "" says Ms. Miranda, the lawyer. ""They might be your best friend's children or your best friend at work. The people who are good to you in your life might be your friends, not your family."" ""I'm planning on leaving most of my estate to my nephew, who is currently 15,"" says Meredith Lesley, 58, a Lexington, Mass., resident who is divorced and has no children. ""Since I own a condo, I need to make a will, but haven't yet,"" says Ms. Lesley, who is a programmer creating web-based software. ""I may leave a smallish portion to my longtime roommate, who is disabled and has nothing but his monthly disability check and no one else in his life. It's not a romantic relationship, but he's lived here for about 10 years. I also have to figure out what to do about my cat. And I have to think about my things: beads to a friend who is a crafter as well; books to my best friend; ceramics to him as well; electronics to my brother, my nephew's father."" ""I should have a brief will dealing with my assets and not let the details get in the way,"" she adds. ""But I haven't done it yet, because of a combination of inertia and denial, I guess. I suppose my brother is my next of kin, but I should formalize things.""

Many Americans do not have a will, and postpone creating one, according to the Health and Retirement Study, a biennial survey of 26,000 people over the age of 50 supported by the National Institute on Aging and administered by the University of Michigan. According to David R. Weir, a co-director of the study, the younger the survey respondents, the fewer report having prepared wills. Even among those over the age of 75, only 75 percent have a will, the study's statistics show. Making a will requires planning, says Ms. Miranda, including choosing an executor, ideally someone who really understands the responsibility involved in that role. ""Find someone who is diligent. It's a pain of a job. It's such a record-keeping nightmare,"" she says. One effective way to make that job easier is to create, and keep updating, an easily accessible document of all your passwords, especially for bank accounts. However you decide to donate your assets, ""it's about legacy,"" says Mr. Pickett, the development director. ""It's a move from success to significance. Your whole life you've probably been focused on your career and getting ahead. Estate planning is really reflecting on your legacy. What do you want to be remembered for?""","Older people without children, stepchildren or grandchildren are choosing to donate to organizations they have ties with.",1b4a60b9-5960-56c3-b6ca-a5316777627f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/03/business/RetiringSUB/RetiringSUB-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=904&w=600&s=1bd6d85e4eb412fe73ee293a4592816fbe6e7509ebbeaa22875390497625261b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Lee C.

Theater,Stars Shine on London's Stage. But Who Wants Stars These Days?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/theater/laura-linney-my-name-is-lucy-barton-orlando-bloom-killer-joe.html,"LONDON -- Suddenly, it seems, the London stage is wreathed in stardust. Laura Linney is here for a blink-and-you'll-miss it run, lending her luminosity to the solo outing ""My Name Is Lucy Barton."" Across town, Orlando Bloom and Alfred Molina are upping the wattage of two other dramas: Mr. Molina in the return of a gripping two-hander, ""Red,"" and Mr. Bloom comfortably adapting to the Southern Gothic environs of ""Killer Joe."" Well, wasn't it ever thus? Not exactly. London's biggest nonmusical success in recent years, and the winner of six Tony Awards last Sunday, was ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child."" Jack Thorne's play boasts a global brand and doesn't need big names. Its West End iteration, at the Palace Theater, just welcomed a third cast, which represents the sort of success more often found in musicals, where a well-known title offers sufficient attraction. (Most people going to ""The Phantom of the Opera"" these days surely have no idea who is playing the title role.) An added issue in London is the gradual disappearance of a generation of actors -- now in their 70s and 80s -- who once defined the city's stage and could be relied on to return there, even as they found a wider audience onscreen. That explains the excitement about the West End opening next month of Ian McKellen in ""King Lear."" Mr. McKellen, at 79, remains one of the increasingly few actors of his vintage who still tread the boards at a time when many colleagues (Michael Gambon, Albert Finney, Maggie Smith) have given up the theater. Another star returning to her stage roots is Glenda Jackson, 82, who just won her first Tony.

But the most lauded play of the past season here, Jez Butterworth's ""The Ferryman,"" which is scheduled to open in New York in October, fielded three casts during its London run -- a testament to the title being the box-office draw, as opposed to a specific individual. That isn't the case with ""My Name Is Lucy Barton,"" although Elizabeth Strout's novel is certainly much admired. Just two years after its publication, the book has been refashioned by the Scottish writer Rona Munro for London's newest playhouse, the Bridge. The main draw is the opportunity for audiences to experience the radiance of Ms. Linney. (The production runs through June 23.) As she steps onto Bob Crowley's appropriately clinical set -- the location is a hospital room, which Ms. Linney paces, battling life's abrasions -- the audience leans into her every word. On opening night, the ovation at the curtain call seemed more heartfelt than usual. You could argue, though, that Ms. Linney's generous spirit is at odds with the piece itself. ""My Name Is Lucy Barton"" asks us to believe that the title character comes to grief with her husband, her children and, most especially, her mother, whose unbidden presence at the stricken Lucy's bedside kick-starts a narrative that is a study in survival, ending with the triumph of a fiercely won present over a grievous past. (Ms. Linney shifts at various points between Lucy's questing voice and that of her reproachful mother.) ""We only have one story"" to tell, Lucy says, but ""My Name Is Lucy Barton"" fires off in more directions than necessary. AIDS and 9/11 both play their part in Lucy's unfolding recollections, as if to up the dramatic stakes. (The character also gets not one but two health scares while in the hospital, neither of them serious.) But these piecemeal nods to larger social and political issues don't explain how such an openhearted character has found herself so alone; we are left to fill in the gaps for ourselves.

So is the ease with which the screen star Orlando Bloom inhabits the shadowy if pulpy realm of ""Killer Joe,"" the Tracy Letts play from 1993 that has brought Mr. Bloom back to the London stage for the first time since 2007. (The production runs at Trafalgar Studios through Aug. 18.) In the intervening quarter-century, Mr. Letts has written far better, less sensational plays, including the Tony- and Pulitzer Prize-winning ""August: Osage County."" Reveling in the same American trailer trash milieu that it reviles, ""Killer Joe"" now looks both overwritten and overeager to shock. (Devotees of onstage nudity will be pleased, including by Mr. Bloom, whose personal trainer should get a shout-out in the program.) There's no denying the swagger brought to the play by its leading man, playing a Texas contract killer with a husky-voiced insouciance and pitch-perfect accent. Not all his colleagues in the director Simon Evans's all-British ensemble are able to rein themselves in as the play moves toward its macabre conclusion, but Mr. Bloom connects to the part of Killer Joe Cooper without any condescension. Let's hope it's not 11 years before his next West End turn.

It's been the better part of nine years since Mr. Molina first played the painter Mark Rothko in ""Red"" at the Donmar Warehouse, after which Michael Grandage's impassioned production was scooped up for an immediate transfer to Broadway, where it won six Tony Awards. The play and its bravura leading player are back through July 28 in a larger theater, Wyndham's, which Mr. Molina and his gracious co-star, Alfred Enoch, fill to bursting with their testy, teasing discourse on the ravages and rewards of art.","Laura Linney and Orlando Bloom are drawing audiences to London's playhouses, even as theatergoers seem to be growing indifferent to who's in the cast.",d25f3d77-be3e-5c93-a198-dd736c9cabb4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/16/arts/16londontheater/16londontheater-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=ef37eaab94f4e4d12b4fb55c9ead404535b5e9e00794fb3d8d82c7637bcaf31b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Laura Linney in ""My Name Is Lucy Barton,"" an adaptation by Rona Munro of the Elizabeth Strout novel, at the Bridge.",d25f3d77-be3e-5c93-a198-dd736c9cabb4,N24News/imgs/d25f3d77-be3e-5c93-a198-dd736c9cabb4.jpg,10
Dance,Think Tank to Ponder a Future for Ballet,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/arts/dance/new-center-at-nyu-focuses-on-dance-and-the-arts.html,"When she wrote ""Apollo's Angels,"" her sweeping history of that most evanescent of art forms, ballet, the dancer turned historian Jennifer Homans was widely hailed for taking an engaging, scholarly approach to more than four centuries of dance. But within the dance world, her book became famous -- or perhaps infamous -- for its final 10 pages, a downbeat epilogue in which Ms. Homans sounded a blunt warning, writing, ""I now feel sure that ballet is dying."" Now Ms. Homans has a chance to try to help the patient, in a modest way: She is opening a ballet think tank, of sorts. Her new organization, the Center for Ballet and the Arts at New York University, where she is a scholar in residence, will open this month with the help of a $2 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Ms. Homans said that its goals include establishing ballet as a serious subject of academic inquiry; drawing new voices into a discussion of its past, present and future; and expanding the conversation beyond the confines of the dance world. ""People have said, 'You are so down on it, the ending of ""Apollo's Angels"" is so grim,' but really what I was trying to do is ask a serious question,"" Ms. Homans said in her brand-new offices on Cooper Square in the East Village, where workers were building a dance studio. ""We're in the middle of a completely changing world, and where is this art form? What is it going to become? And I think that is a question that we're all answering now, and the center can be a part of the answer. It's trying to create a place for us to say this really matters -- what can it become?""

The center will grant a few fellowships each semester to people from the worlds of dance, academia and beyond and allow them to pursue a broad range of projects. ""One of the main points of the center is to bring minds from other disciplines and art forms to focus, and to bear, on ballet,"" Ms. Homans said. One member of the first group of fellows is the documentary filmmaker Frederick Wiseman, who has several films about dance, including ""Ballet,"" a 1995 profile of American Ballet Theater, and ""La Danse,"" his 2009 look at the Paris Opera Ballet. (Mr. Wiseman said he thinks of his 2010 film, ""Boxing Gym,"" as a dance film as well.) But Mr. Wiseman's project at the center this fall will not involve making a film of dance, but quite the opposite: making a dance out of one of his films. He said he planned to work with the choreographer James Sewell, of the Minneapolis-based James Sewell Ballet, to turn one of his early films, ""Titicut Follies,"" about a state prison for the criminally insane, into a ballet. ""I wanted to see whether it would be possible to do a classical ballet on a contemporary subject,"" he said. Another fellow, Heather Watts, the former New York City Ballet star, said she would spend her time at the center thinking about new ways to analyze and contextualize the ballets of George Balanchine -- who made her a principal dancer -- for 21st-century audiences. She said she might ultimately develop an online lecture or an app delving into not just choreography and biography, but also some of the broader cultural themes at work in the field. As an example, she noted that Balanchine created ""Stars and Stripes"" around the same time that Jasper Johns was painting his flags.

""All of this is against Balanchine's better wishes,"" Ms. Watts said, noting his oft-expressed desire for people simply to enjoy, and not over-analyze, his work. She recalled how he would tell his ballerinas, ""Don't think, just dance."" But she said that when she taught a course on Balanchine at Harvard a few years ago, she began to see that while it was not necessary to know anything to enjoy Balanchine ballets, there was a value to learning something about the culture and time that produced them. In her bearish epilogue to ""Apollo's Angels,"" published in 2010, Ms. Homans, who is also dance critic for The New Republic, pointed to ballet's struggles after the deaths of the great 20th-century dance figures, its risks of becoming hidebound and its diminishing cultural footprint in the United States, among other woes. ""If we are lucky, I am wrong, and classical ballet is not dying but falling instead into a deep sleep, to be reawakened -- like the Sleeping Beauty -- by a new generation,"" she wrote. In a wide-ranging conversation about dance, Ms. Homans said she saw reasons to be optimistic, from some of the spectacular dancers performing today to the strong passions many have for ballet. ""I actually think this is a really hopeful moment,"" she said. While the new center will not initially serve students, she said she hoped it would ultimately help ballet secure a greater toehold in academia. ""You take Music 101, you take Art 101 -- where is the dance?"" she asked. ""And where is ballet in particular? Here is an art form that has a history, a 400-year history, it is part of our civilization, and yet it doesn't have a presence.""

Philip E. Lewis, a vice president of the Mellon Foundation, said that while the initial grant would fund the center for three years, there was a hope that the center could be renewed. ""We hope that ballet, like the other high performing arts, will eventually become a form of cultural expression that's more accessible to the public at large, and not so much understood as a kind of aristocratic art form,"" he said. Ms. Homans said that she hoped that inviting people from different fields would lead to a cross-pollination of ideas about ballet and perhaps make it part of a wider cultural discussion. Next year, when the center presents its first Lincoln Kirstein lecture, it will be delivered not by a dancer or choreographer but by the poetry critic and Harvard professor Helen Vendler, who will talk about dance and poetry. And the center plans to make full use of its site in New York.

Opinion,Carlota's World: What Children Can Teach Us During the Coronavirus Crisis,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-carlota-children-ramos.html,"MIAMI -- The door of Carlota's room is ajar, so I peek inside to see what she's doing. She's sitting upright at her desk with her laptop in front of her. On the screen are a dozen of her schoolmates, all of them, like Carlota, participating in a virtual class. I can tell that their teacher is leading the lesson from her home -- I'm pretty sure they're discussing fractions and decimals -- but Carlota and her friends are following closely along as if she were talking to them in person.

Everything seems normal. And yet nothing is.

I live in the same house as Carlota, a wonderful, loving and brilliant 9-year-old girl, and the daughter of Chiquinquira Delgado, my partner. Carlota brought happiness into my life from the moment I met her, just a few months after her birth, and I couldn't imagine this house without her in it. ""Good morning everyone!"" she shouts from her bedroom when she wakes up. Her tireless energy -- she loves to create dance moves -- and curiosity has made the tedium of quarantine a bit easier to endure.

Carlota -- like the roughly half of the world's population living in coronavirus-induced lockdown -- has been stuck at home for several weeks now, and there are times when her sadness and frustration rise to the surface. Like when she wonders, with tears in her eyes, if we'll still be able to throw her a birthday party in May. Or when she wants to get together with her friends and doesn't quite understand why they can't come over. One of our biggest achievements as parents during the crisis was taking Carlota on a short bike ride with one of her friends. The kids enjoyed it, but saying goodbye without touching was really hard for them.

The truth, however, is that Carlota's generation -- there are an estimated 74 million children under 17 in the United States -- is much better prepared than ours to face months of isolation. These young people have been unintentionally training for this moment all their lives. From a very young age, they've been communicating with one another using devices that never existed in my time. So when we told them they couldn't leave the house, all they did was enter ""virtual mode.""","No talking face to face, no hugging or kissing can become an unhealthy habit for this generation.

Opinion,Bolsonaro Doesn't Deserve the Nickname 'Trump of the Tropics.' (Not Even That!),https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/opinion/bolsonaro-duvivier-brazil.html,"RIO DE JANEIRO -- I was born over 30 years ago, just as democracy in Brazil was emerging. Yes, Brazilian democracy is the same age as Lindsay Lohan. Like her, it had its heyday in the 2000s and didn't fare well with the onset of adulthood. My parents voted for a president for the first time in their lifetime in 1989 when I was 3 years old. I grew up hearing frightening stories about the military dictatorship. In one, torturers attached a man's mouth to the carburetor of a car with the engine running and left the man to die. In another, Col. Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra inserted rats into a captive pregnant woman's vagina. This is what Brazilians were living through while Woodstock and Watergate were happening in the United States. Here, reporters like Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein went missing or ""committed suicide"" in physics-defying conditions that would have been impossible without the help of the state. Those who find similarities between President Jair Bolsonaro and President Trump don't grasp the depth of the situation in Brazil. Mr. Bolsonaro has not masked his affection for the military dictatorship. In fact, he considers Colonel Ustra, who ran a torture center in the '70s, a ""national hero."" Though media has given him the nickname ""Trump of the Tropics,"" Mr. Bolsonaro seems more like a cross between Chile's Augusto Pinochet and Borat. I'm a Brazilian comedian. While it may sound easy given our current political climate, it's actually very difficult to make jokes about a president who already seems to be a parody. It's hard to compete with reality.

I'm part of Porta dos Fundos, a comedy collective I cocreated in 2012 with four friends -- Fabio Porchat, Antonio Tabet, Ian SBF and Joao Vicente de Castro. We had all worked in television, where we couldn't make jokes about sex, politics or religion -- basically, the funniest topics. So we took to the internet, where our style of humor resonated. Then in 2017, Viacom bought half of our company. We're now part of an American corporation, but of course that doesn't stop people from calling us Communists -- a word Mr. Bolsonaro is still throwing around as an insult. Vintage, no? But that's not the worst of it. Perhaps it's common knowledge that Brazilians wouldn't be caught dead at the beach wearing surf shorts. But there's a layer of Brazilian political life that may surprise some: The secular state is a concept that has not made its way south of Ecuador, though church and state are formally separated. Here, Speedos and theocracy reign supreme. To give you an idea of what we're up against, there's an evangelical ""bancada,"" which roughly translates as ""bench,"" in Congress. This is not just a Christian lobby, or a handful of congressional representatives who are Christians. The bench comprises more than 80 representatives out of 513 federal deputies, who go to Congress with their Bibles in hand and vote accordingly. Many are pastors, police officers or both, like Pastor Sargento Isidorio, who is famous for claims to cure drug addicts with a clubbing. I guess it worked for him. Once a gay drug addict, he has been born again. Here's an idea of the scale of our problem with secularism: The most cited name during President Dilma Rousseff's impeachment was God. No, he didn't make any suspicious deposits, nor did they find any emails in his name, but apparently it was he who asked a hundred Brazilian deputies to have the president removed from office.

We did a Christmas special for Netflix about Jesus' youth titled ""The First Temptation of Christ."" Mr. Porchat opens with the fact that the Bible has a glaring gap. Jesus is 12 and -- bam -- he's already 30 years old being baptized in the River Jordan. Why is there no account of his youth? What were they trying to hide? We hypothesized that Jesus loved men. We weren't the first to come up with this, of course. Before us, Mark the Evangelist had already told us in that apocryphal text that ""The youth came to him, wearing a linen cloth over his naked body. And he remained with him that night, for Jesus taught him the mystery of the kingdom of God."" Brazil's evangelical bench may not know this passage, just as it certainly does not know of Monty Python, Mel Brooks, ""South Park"" and so many who have already poked fun at the sacred cows of Christendom before we did. Today, there are a dozen lawsuits and petitions demanding the content be taken down. The Public Prosecutor's Office accepted a petition from a Catholic organization that demanded not only censorship but also payment of a fine of nearly half a million dollars -- two cents for each Brazilian who professes Catholicism in the country. I'm curious about this accounting. I was baptized in the Catholic Church, but I didn't receive my first communion. Am I entitled to two cents? Does not receiving communion disqualify me, or am I eligible for one penny? Does the remaining penny go to those who were confirmed? This is not new to us. What has changed is that since this president took office, the attacks have come in different forms. On Dec. 24, for example, a group of masked men attempted to set our offices on fire with Molotov cocktails. The security guard managed to put out the fire and no one was hurt. The next day, a group that called itself Popular National Insurgence Command, inspired by the Integralist movement, claimed responsibility for the attack. Brazilian Integralism was a 1930s anti-Semitic movement -- yes, there were many Brazilians, of mixed race themselves, who were sympathetic to a movement that would have sent them to a concentration camp. We believed the movement had been eradicated along with syphilis and tuberculosis. But it seems all these evils are back in Mr. Bolsonaro's Brazil.

Humor, of course, is not the only thing affected by the government. I acted in the film ""Invisible Life,"" which won the Un Certain Regard prize at Cannes this year, but in Brazil it was not supported by the National Cinema Agency, whose director at the time claimed that the producer was a Communist. Anyone who knows the market knows this makes no sense. No one is less Communist than a film producer! Public agencies -- most of them -- are being replaced by ""government loyalists,"" to use Mr. Bolsonaro's own term. The president has already said that he is not in favor of censorship but rather of protecting ""Christian values."" One doesn't need to attack Christianity, however, to be fired. When the director of Brazil's National Institute for Space Research released data on deforestation, the president ousted him -- perhaps reality is also an enemy of Christian values. Although our president doesn't deserve the nickname ""Trump of the Tropics"" (not even that!), he was certainly greatly helped by the outcome of the American elections. If the United States elected an oligophrenic, why couldn't Brazil? We look forward to the result of impeachment and this year's elections. Hopefully Mr. Trump's fall will presage the demise of his tropical wannabes. Gregorio Duvivier is a Brazilian actor, poet and producer. He hosts ""Greg News"" on HBO.

Food,"As Mainstays Depart, Charleston Asks Where Its Restaurant Scene Is Headed",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/dining/charleston-restaurants.html,"On Hominy Grill's last day, April 28, customers waited in line for more than an hour. There were plenty of tears and goodbye hugs, like this one between K.J. Nelson and another member of the staff.





As Mainstays Depart, Charleston Asks Where Its Restaurant Scene Is Headed

CHARLESTON, S.C. -- Nathalie Dupree, the doyenne of Southern cooking, sat at a sunny table near the window at Hominy Grill in late April, a few days before it would serve its last biscuit, and insisted on an order of shrimp and okra beignets. Ms. Dupree, 79, also required a plate of curry-scented Country Captain and some shrimp bog, the wetter, milder cousin to Louisiana's jambalaya. She had a waiter bring bowls of lima beans and tomato pudding, then a slice each of coconut cake and buttermilk pie. The dense chocolate pudding with its whipped cream cap had already sold out for the day. But never mind: She had a cup of it stashed in her home not too far away. ""I just don't know who is ever going to make these dishes in this way ever again,"" she said. ""This is the end of something.""

By itself, the closing of a 23-year-old restaurant in a city whose dining culture stretches back to the George Washington administration doesn't signify the death of anything other than a place whose chef and owner, Robert Stehling, 55, was ready to end a good run and move on to something that didn't require as much effort. But Hominy Grill was a seminal place, a bastion of Lowcountry cooking that helped turn this city into a culinary destination. It closed in the same month that the chef Sean Brock officially severed all ties to the restaurants that had vaulted him to national fame, including McCrady's and especially Husk, where he drilled down into the African roots of Southern agriculture and made a religion out of cast-iron cornbread. Mr. Brock opened Husk in 2010 with the swagger of a prizefighter, promising to show that Southern cuisine was the greatest in the world. He came close, leading Southern food into a new chapter begun by Hominy Grill, the original Watershed restaurant in Atlanta, and before them, Highlands Bar & Grill in Birmingham, Ala., and Crook's Corner in Chapel Hill, N.C.

The departures of Mr. Brock and Hominy Grill have turned up the heat on a discussion that was already brewing in Charleston, a jewel-box city built on hospitality and rice culture but also on a brutal history as the nation's capital of the slave trade. At least 100,000 captured Africans passed through Charleston Harbor on their way to being sold as slaves. ""I don't know what the city is right now,"" said B.J. Dennis, a chef whose cooking centers on the Gullah Geechee food traditions developed by West Africans who were enslaved along the southeastern Atlantic coast. His ancestors come from a Gullah Geechee community in Wando, outside Charleston. ""We lost our culinary identity, and I am not just talking about Gullah Geechee but about the whole Lowcountry cuisine,"" Mr. Dennis said. ""The locals of Charleston have been pushed to the wayside, the black locals and the white locals, for this new wave of tourists and people moving here."" He is one of many Charlestonians who complain that the city is crowded with concept restaurants serving $18 cocktails and expensive, mediocre interpretations of Lowcountry standards. ""It's like, let me get some grits and put a million things in it and a bunch of cheese and some duck that doesn't even make sense on the plate, and charge you $30 for it,"" he said. ""Basically, I think we're just a Southern Brooklyn. A Williamsburg.""

When Hominy Grill opened in 1996, the city's Navy base and shipyard was closing. Civic leaders turned with new dedication to tourism. To say they succeeded is an understatement. More than seven million tourists a year crowd Charleston's charming streets, some with homes that date to the early 1700s. Even on a weekday night, the city seems filled with bachelorettes tumbling out of Uber cars, culinary tourists angling for tables and wide-eyed cruise ship passengers, 225,000 of whom arrived in 2018. The feel-good machine doesn't seem to stop. The Charleston Wine & Food Festival, which Ms. Dupree helped start in 2006, packs in 30,000 people each year, and is so popular that NBC's ""Today"" show broadcast live from the event in March. For eight years in a row, the city has topped Conde Nast Traveler's list of the best small American cities. Southern Living readers picked it as the South's best city for 2019. It has held the top spot on Travel & Leisure magazine's best-cities list for six years in a row. As a result, the city is in the middle of the biggest hotel and restaurant boom in its history. The restaurants Mr. Brock once presided over have changed, too, even though the same restaurant group still owns them. Husk has spawned sister restaurants in Greenville, S.C., and Nashville , neither of which he is involved with anymore. McCrady's, a historic restaurant that Mr. Brock helped reinvent in 2006, used to feature dishes like his beet au poivre, in which the vegetable was pressure-cooked, dehydrated and coated in peppercorns so it presented like dry-aged New York strip steak. Now the only beet dish on the menu is a salad dressed in raspberry vinaigrette. Next door at Minero, the Mexican restaurant he started, a sandwich board on the street beckons customers with the promise of tequila and TV, not the nixtamalized masa handmade from heirloom corn. ""You look at the number of restaurants and the amount of people who are coming and the size of the talent pool, and it doesn't add up anymore,"" Mr. Brock said. He is not as concerned as some. ""The great adjustment happening in Charleston isn't necessarily a bad thing,"" he said. ""It will be easier to sift through the ashes and see what's important. What's left will be the thing that moves it forward.""

Still, he and others worry about places like Hannibal's Kitchen, Nana's Seafood & Soul and Martha Lou's Kitchen, small restaurants whose plates of crab rice, steamed garlic blue crabs and fried chicken offer a direct line to the region's Gullah Geechee ancestors. ""We'll be fine without 9,000 Italian restaurants in Charleston,"" Mr. Brock said, ""but we can't take our finger off the pulse of those institutions."" Kenyatta McNeil, the owner of Nana's, has watched the change sweep through the block where his little three-table shop sits. He grew up in a nearby housing project. The neighborhood has gone from mostly black to mostly white, and 75 percent of his customers are now tourists. To bolster business at his and other soul-food institutions in and around downtown Charleston, he started a tour called Geechee Eats Food Shuttle in 2017. It hasn't really taken off, he said. ""The power in Charleston has always been one way and not our way,"" Mr. McNeil said. ""It's all about branding now, and black restaurants in Charleston aren't branding ourselves the way the white restaurants do.""

Tradd Newton, a grandson of the founder of the Piggly Wiggly Carolina Company who owns Tradd's and the seafood restaurant Fleet Landing with his wife, Weesie, doesn't think Charleston is in the middle of a culinary identity crisis. It's just going through a thinning out. That's one reason he decided on a more continental menu for Tradd's. ""There's enough Southern cuisine and enough Southern restaurants that have opened in the last 10 years,"" he said. Yes, he added, there is a wider variety of tourists to contend with. Finding enough qualified employees is a challenge. Parking is awful and rents are high. ""But other cities have grown and thrived and we can, too,"" he said. ""I think everybody's going to be O.K."" Charleston doesn't lack for well-regarded restaurants. The chef Mike Lata continues to show his mastery of seafood at the Ordinary and high-level culinary agility at FIG. Last year, a New York couple opened Tu, serving food from the Indian subcontinent, as a companion to their popular Xiao Bao Biscuit. Coming soon is an outpost of Big Bad Breakfast from the Mississippi chef John Currence, who once cooked at Crook's Corner. Matt Lee, the cookbook author and a resident of Charleston who chronicles Southern food with his brother, Ted, said the city was simply suffering from the kind of adjustments that might come when the most popular student in high school heads off to college. ""The recent closings/openings/'reconceptings' and chef moves are pretty typical for any growing city where there's an extreme staffing shortage and seemingly no end of investor money coming in,"" he wrote in an email. ""Absent any major economic shifts, it appears to be just usual turnover as the restaurant scene and its personnel evolve.""

Back at Hominy Grill, talk around the table was not as upbeat. The city's restaurant game has changed forever, said Nunally Kersh, Mr. Stehling's wife. ""It's not about the chefs anymore,"" she said. ""You can't just come with a dollar and dream."" The two met when they were college kids working for the chef Bill Neal, who opened Crook's Corner in 1982, and is credited with turning the fisherman's breakfast of shrimp and grits into a Southern restaurant standard. The couple moved to New York, where Mr. Stehling spent almost a decade cooking, including at Home in Greenwich Village. In the mid-1990s, Ms. Kersh took a job as the producer of the Spoleto Festival, and they returned to Charleston. Mr. Stehling decided to open a restaurant that would carry on the legacy of Mr. Neal, who died in 1991. Charleston was a place where people understood the style of Southern food Mr. Stehling wanted to cook. ""I didn't want to explain hoppin' John for the rest of my life,"" he said.

Back then, Ms. Kersh and Mr. Stehling could have bought the building for $350,000, but they couldn't afford it. By the time they could, in 2008, it cost $1.8 million. A recent appraisal put its value at $2.5 million, Ms. Kersh said. The neighborhood has been transformed. In the beginning, the staff could walk to work, and customers drove; now it's the other way around. The staff can't afford to live in the area anymore. The conversation about the role food plays in Charleston has changed, too, particularly as the city moves deeper into reckoning with its past. The 2015 murders of nine black parishioners by a young white supremacist laid bare the work left to do.",Hominy Grill has closed. Sean Brock is gone. Tourism and prices are booming.

Movies,'A Towering Task' Review: Peace and Its Discontents,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/movies/a-towering-task-review.html,"""A Towering Task: The Story of the Peace Corps"" opens with testimonials from alumni of the U.S. volunteer mission. When they describe the ""uncomfortable"" conditions of Third World countries, the film offers images of slums. When they talk about having to relinquish their American identities and empathize with ""ordinary people"" of other cultures, it obliges with swelling, inspirational music.

This air of paternalism pervades Alana DeJoseph's sweeping, though mostly superficial history, even as it touches upon the contradictions inherent in the program's origins as a Cold War tactic of soft power. DeJoseph charts the political negotiations during other moments when the mission's diplomatic and altruistic motives appeared at odds -- the Vietnam War; the fall of Eastern bloc Communism.

Fashion & Style,Priyanka Chopra of 'Quantico' Shares Her Beauty Tricks,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/10/fashion/priyanka-chopra-of-quantico-shares-her-beauty-tricks.html,"The actress Priyanka Chopra, 33, made a career in Bollywood before becoming the first South Asian woman to lead an American network series -- that is, the ABC drama ""Quantico."" Though she is currently filming in Montreal for the show, which has been renewed for a second season, she is more often ""based on a plane,"" she said. Ms. Chopra was born in Jamshedpur, India, but was also raised in Newton, Mass., and Queens. Her beauty regimen is a hybrid of Indian D.I.Y. and Western favorites. What is most important for your skin care is what you do the night before. You have to remove all remnants of makeup before you go to bed no matter how tired you are. I double wash because I wear a lot of makeup when I work. Right now, I'm using Chanel Intense Brightening Foam Cleanser, followed by MAC Green Gel Cleanser. I have dry skin, but it's still very important to take off all the makeup and grime. I also double moisturize. I use the Kiehl's serum called Daily Reviving Concentrate and then a cream by Tatcha. I've also found that StriVectin under-eye cream really works for me. I'm also trying some lip balms by StriVectin.

For my body, I moisturize with Bio-Oil and a body lotion from Diptyque. If I'm going in the sun, I wear a face sunscreen by Shiseido. I find most of my products from reading magazines and listening to what makeup artists tell me to do. And I usually do all my shopping at the duty-free, so I keep trying new things. Whenever I'm tired or getting on a flight, I'll wear the SK-II mask. I'm usually in a cabin on the plane, and I just shut the door and put it on. Sometimes I'll put on fresh yogurt as a mask with a little turmeric powder in it -- this is like an Indian trick. The turmeric is a healer for your skin.

I try to wear very little makeup on a day-to-day basis. I use Armani foundation under my eyes if I need to. Then it's mostly just lip balm or a lip stain. I like the lip stains by Laura Mercier. I also like MAC and Nars lipsticks when I'm doing something bold. If MAC, I have Lady Danger, Candy Yum Yum, Ruby Woo, Russian Red and Studded Kiss. Nars, I like the Dolce Vita. I stick with the matte lipsticks. I don't wear gloss. I have really big lips, and when I wear gloss, they look way bigger. I have to keep them in check! My mom wears kohl all the time. It's an amazing look and part of our culture for eons. Kohl makes big brown or black eyes stand out that much more. But I'm not big on the smoky eye. I like to keep the eye fresh. I just use YSL mascara and then an Anastasia Beverly Hills pencil for my brows. I actually use my fingers to curl up my mascara. I'm not very meticulous when it comes to my makeup. I pretty much use my fingers, except I'll use a brush for my blush. Right now, I'm using a Chanel powder blush in Rose Ecrin. The color comes off very natural. Otherwise, I'm in the makeup chair almost every day. It's an interesting thing, the concept of ""beauty"" as an actor. People have doubted my abilities because of my beauty, and I've enjoyed proving to them that beauty shouldn't have anything to do with your ability to tell the story. It's important for actors to be chameleons. Beauty is just one aspect.

I'm very blessed with Indian genes. I have good hair. When I was young, my grandmother used to give me coconut-oil head massages. I used to say, 'I don't want it!' Now of course I know how great it was. I like Oribe products. I love the smell, and I find they make my hair glossy. I use the shampoo, conditioner and maybe a serum. Because I'm sitting in the hair and makeup chair all the time, my hair gets blown out, but it's actually wavy. I let it be and pull it back if it's my day off. For haircuts, I get trims. I can't change it much because I'm always filming some scene for a character, and you need continuity. I'm telling a story. I try to get massages whenever I can, but I'm not very fussy.

Real Estate,Bethesda Readies for a Major Remake,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/realestate/commercial/bethesda-maryland-remake.html,"For decades, the downtown in Bethesda, Md., had little more than a hardware store, a toy store and a few restaurants. The small urban core along Wisconsin Avenue was mostly a place to pass through on the way to the District of Columbia a few miles to the south, or the Bethesda Naval Hospital or the National Institutes of Health several blocks to the north. But in the mid-1980s, as the Metro subway system's Red Line was extended to Bethesda, the unincorporated community began to take on the characteristics of a small city. Soon several high-rise buildings were constructed. They were filled by law firms, financial service companies and trade associations. Hotels, restaurants and boutiques soon followed, and a Barnes & Noble bookstore opened as an anchor in a revitalized retail area a few blocks from the Metro station. It was not too long before a bank replaced the hardware store on Wisconsin Avenue, movie theaters opened, and dozens of new restaurants arrived in the new pedestrian-friendly streetscape.

Marriott International, the world's largest hotel firm, was among the first to sign on. The company, based in a suburban office park on the fringes of Bethesda since 1979, recently announced plans for a $600 million project in downtown Bethesda, a block north of the Metro station. The company expects to move its 3,500 employees from its 800,000-square-foot midrise complex near the Capital Beltway to a soon-to-be-built office building with 22 stories. Marriott also plans to open a hotel with at least 230 rooms and meeting spaces for conferences. The site, now occupied by low-rise commercial buildings, is near the famous greasy spoon the Tastee Diner, a popular relic of a bygone Bethesda. The county and the state have agreed to provide up to $62 million in subsidies and tax benefits to keep Marriott in Montgomery County and relocate about five miles from its current site. Montgomery County has also agreed to lease Marriott a public parking garage for weekday use during business hours, and the company expects to build its own underground garage with about 800 spaces. Marriott expects to enter into a long-term lease with the owners/developers, Boston Properties and the Bernstein Companies, said Carolyn B. Handlon, executive vice president finance and global treasurer of Marriott International.

Company officials were excited to be moving to a more urban setting, where employees will be able to walk, bike or take the Metro to work, Ms. Handlon said. Planners and public officials predict that other large companies may follow Marriott. ""All of that land is very desirable,"" said Nancy Floreen, a Montgomery County council member, chairwoman of the council committee that reviewed the new plans for Bethesda. Ms. Handlon said: ""We asked our associates what they wanted. There was a common theme. Besides state-of-the-art technology, there was a real sense people wanted that vibrant, mixed-use urban community that you could walk to."" Marriott's decision to get away from its car-centric office park and move its employees into an urban setting is the latest in a broader effort by Montgomery County planners to bring more people to its existing urban centers, and to create new ones, like the White Flint development a few miles north.

The new plan, which the Montgomery County Council accepted much of in a straw vote on April 25 before an expected formal vote in late May, also proposes a series of new, small parks and more bike lanes and walkways. Council members on April 25 endorsed limiting heights of commercial buildings closer to residential areas. The planners also want to encourage developers to include more affordable housing in their plans, by giving them additional density if they add extra moderate-priced housing into their mix. Affordable housing has been difficult to find in Bethesda for years. Many of the condos in downtown Bethesda sell for more than $1 million, and rentals for one-bedrooms can be expensive in newer buildings.

Some residents in neighborhoods just across Wisconsin Avenue from the Metro and the Marriott site are worried that the new development will lead to traffic jams and other problems. They said they were fearful even though county planners proposed placing a cap on density that would allow no more than 4.2 million square feet in new construction if the plans are approved, as expected. ""The pace and scale of the development has gotten to the point that I feel the county is unable to keep up with it,"" said Amanda Farber, an East Bethesda resident and co-vice president of the East Bethesda Citizens Association. Many nearby public schools are already overcrowded, according to county data. Gwen Wright, Montgomery County's planning director, said the county's public school system could opt to reopen some closed schools for younger students and might need to whether or not the new plan brings new students. Eventually, however, she said the community would have to come to grips with the need for a new high school in the Bethesda area.

It is appropriate ""to have a compact with our existing neighborhoods to shield them from the worst effect of development, to have tall buildings right next to neighborhoods,"" he said at a recent council meeting. Ms. Floreen said she thought Bethesda would remain a desirable place to live, work, shop and dine even with new buildings. ""It is on a Metro line, yet convenient to suburbia, and an urban location,"" she said. What the new plan will do, she hopes, is find ways to ""create the right incentives for people to do interesting things in Bethesda.""",Plans include Marriott International moving its headquarters from the suburbs to downtown.,a413cdcc-a678-5fab-a73a-76c4232090a6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/03/business/03BETHESDASQFT1/03BETHESDASQFT1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=466facafbdfafd7cc4aef50f43d2eeb0f1683024a9020b6e0c46c20276fdb54d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Metro station in the heart of the central business district in Bethesda, Md.

The newly released second season of ""Cupcake & Dino"" is as perky and warm as the first, and its cheery silliness is appropriate for most ages. On each episode, the brothers take on some kind of unusual gig -- throwing a slumber party, hosting a baby beauty pageant, humming an old woman to sleep -- and discover both the joy of a job well done and the frustrations of working for the man.

Media,Jake Tapper and Kellyanne Conway Clashed. Will Critics Take On Tapper?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/business/media/jake-tapper-kellyanne-conway.html,"After a contentious interview on Tuesday in which Kellyanne Conway, the presidential adviser, and Jake Tapper of CNN clashed over whether the White House or the news media was more indifferent to facts, the journalist was bracing on Wednesday for a backlash from the right. While the 25-minute interview touched on issues like the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as education secretary and President Trump's relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, the bulk of it focused on Mr. Trump's criticism of the media and the administration's penchant for repeating falsehoods. The interview was frequently testy, and Mr. Tapper's performance was widely praised by those seeking a more aggressive approach to fact-checking the Trump administration.

Ms. Conway's CNN appearance came amid growing questions about her credibility after she falsely spoke of a ""Bowling Green massacre"" that never happened and used the phrase ""alternative facts"" to justify the administration's view of the truth. She repeatedly corrected the Bowling Green error and apologized for it on Tuesday, but reports later emerged that she had previously invoked the nonexistent episode in an interview with Cosmopolitan magazine (which did not print the quotation) and with TMZ. Some critics are calling on cable news outlets to bar her from appearing on air, and CNN declined to have her on as a guest Sunday.

Mr. Trump added to tension with the press by accusing news organizations of playing down or declining to cover terrorist attacks. The White House on Monday issued a list of what it said were 78 underreported attacks; but several news organizations, including CNN and The Times, provided evidence to the contrary. On Tuesday, Ms. Conway questioned the focus and tone of more recent news coverage. Without citing examples, she criticized descriptions of Mr. Trump that lacked ""a certain respect for and recognition of the dignity for the office of the president.""

When Ms. Conway suggested that the media had played down some attacks because people had become ""inured to terrorist attacks,"" Mr. Tapper protested. ""Well, your spin about the idea that we don't want to be inured to that, that's a lovely spin, but that's not what he was saying, Kellyanne,"" he said. ""He was saying the media does not cover these stories because we don't want to cover them because we have some sort of agenda."" ""That's what he was suggesting,"" he added, ""and it's offensive given the fact that CNN and other media organizations have reporters in danger right now in war zones covering ISIS, and I just don't understand how the president can make an attack like that."" On Wednesday, after the report that he would be targeted, Mr. Tapper appeared to be enjoying the #TapperDirtFile Twitter hashtag that had been created in his honor. Users professed to expose damaging, but made-up, tidbits to be used in a hit piece about him, such as liking Nickelback or the time he ordered a ""large coffee"" at Starbucks. He even added his own ""dirt"" on Twitter, posting that he listened to the Billy Joel Channel on SiriusXM radio and that he had seen every ""Final Destination"" movie -- ""Yes, all five of them.""","After a contentious interview with the presidential adviser, the CNN journalist, braces for a conservative backlash.",29e3c8e4-857c-5fdc-a224-1fcd7625e4d4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/08/us/09xp-tapper2/09xp-tapper2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=96ce9e9105b607650132f88954a040e2810ec863d228e40f0ab854c46ca7fab4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jake Tapper, host of ""The Lead"" on CNN.",29e3c8e4-857c-5fdc-a224-1fcd7625e4d4,N24News/imgs/29e3c8e4-857c-5fdc-a224-1fcd7625e4d4.jpg,16
Health,New York Will Test the Dead More Often for Coronavirus and Flu,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/06/health/covid-flu-testing.html,"New York Will Test the Dead More Often for Coronavirus and Flu

Cough, fever, chills -- with fall fast on the way, symptoms alone won't be useful in distinguishing Covid-19 from similar-looking cases of the flu. That means routinely testing for both viruses will be crucial -- even, perhaps, after some patients have already died. That will at least be true in New York, where officials recently announced a ramp-up in post-mortem testing for the coronavirus as well as the flu. Deaths linked to respiratory illnesses that weren't confirmed before a person died are to be followed up with tests for both viruses within 48 hours, according to the new regulation. ""These regulations will ensure we have the most accurate death data possible as we continue to manage Covid-19 while preparing for flu season,"" Dr. Howard Zucker, the state's health commissioner, said in a statement last week. Deceased hospital patients and nursing home residents, as well as bodies in the care of funeral directors or medical examiners, will be among those targeted for follow-up testing. If experts at a local facility can't perform the test themselves, they can ask the state to run the test for them at its public health lab.

Although the results of these tests will be too late to change the course of treatment for the deceased, they can still help health officials track the prevalence of both types of infections, as well as indicate whether to warn close contacts of the deceased that they may need to quarantine. ""People need to know who around them was sick,"" said Dr. Valerie Fitzhugh, a pathologist at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School. ""If someone can't be tested in life, why not test them soon after death?"" Putting regulations in place ahead of time will also encourage counties to bolster their testing readiness ahead of autumn and winter, when seasonal viruses like flu and respiratory syncytial virus, or R.S.V., tend to thrive, said Dr. Mary Fowkes, a clinical pathologist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. In many parts of the country, coronavirus cases are still ratcheting up every day -- and will become more difficult to track when similar sicknesses muddle the picture. ""I think that is important to prepare for,"" Dr. Fowkes said. In the early days of the pandemic, New York, like the rest of the country, struggled to rein in the virus. Many illnesses went untested, including those of several thousand people whose deaths were later reclassified as presumed, but unconfirmed, cases of Covid-19. A lot has changed since the spring, said Gareth Rhodes, deputy superintendent and special counsel at the New York State Department of Financial Services and a member of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's virus response team. After a sputtering start to testing in March, New York is now running about 100,000 coronavirus tests a day, with positivity rates hovering around 1 percent or less. While hundreds remain hospitalized throughout the state, daily deaths attributable to Covid-19 have averaged in the single digits since late August.

The new regulations also stipulate that living patients with flulike symptoms or a known exposure to the coronavirus or a flu virus should be tested for both pathogens. That makes it less likely that a case will be missed in the first place.
* Who should get a booster shot? It depends, Dr. Scott Gottlieb says. ""We track fatalities very closely,"" Mr. Rhodes said. At this point, he added, New York's coronavirus testing regimens in medical settings are pretty consistent. ""You can't really be a hospital in New York right now without testing,"" he said. The regulation doesn't apply to all deaths -- just those suspected of being linked to a respiratory illness. That means the new rules on post-mortem testing probably won't change coronavirus case numbers much, if at all. Since the announcement, made last Sunday, the Wadsworth state lab has not yet received a request to process a post-mortem test, Mr. Rhodes said. Still, the regulation may come in handy if, for example, a death were to occur en route to the hospital or shortly after arrival, or if an emergency prompted a temporary lab closure so that tests could not be immediately run. Others might die at home, or elsewhere outside the care of a hospital or nursing home, without easy access to tests. ""This is designed to catch anything that fell through the cracks,"" said Dr. Rosemary She, a pathologist at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine. Thorough testing can also affect which bodies are autopsied at medical examiners' offices, where resources and staff have been strained, said Dr. Erin Brooks, a pathologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Someone whose cause of death can be confirmed by a positive test for the coronavirus, for instance, might not need to be investigated further.","New regulations require a ramp-up in testing for patients with symptoms, as well as people who weren't tested before they died.",ee2aed59-b821-5bef-a643-c38b2b17074e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/06/business/06virus-briefing-tests/merlin_172251432_7f102877-ef33-429b-a88f-103a8e2c8f64-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=24a63bac5794f5dcb42695f25e9da9547f608709c97275de869cf91b7e434707&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Refrigerated trucks used as makeshift morgues in Manhattan in May.,ee2aed59-b821-5bef-a643-c38b2b17074e,N24News/imgs/ee2aed59-b821-5bef-a643-c38b2b17074e.jpg,1
Books,An Earlier Age When the United States Kept Immigrants Out,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/books/review/michael-dobbs-unwanted.html,"Relative wealth and connections abroad meant that many Jews from Kippenheim were able to escape to Britain, Canada and the United States. Hedy was sent to Britain on a Kindertransport in May 1940. But the bureaucratic churn of long lines, rerouted ships and missed connections left many stranded. In October 1940, Jews in the southwest German region of Baden, which included Kippenheim, were deported to Vichy France, where they were interned in a muddy, typhous wasteland at Gurs. Of the 6,500 Jews deported, roughly one in four died in French camps; four out of 10 were sent to Auschwitz. Still, several Kippenheimers made it to Marseille and then on to the United States via Morocco.

Dobbs never says why he chose Kippenheim as the focus for his investigation, but the town's survivors and their descendants have guarded a trove of documents that allowed him to render their stories in remarkable and poignant detail. Max and Fanny Valfer, for example, had a consular appointment in Marseille scheduled for Dec. 8, 1941, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, but now Washington considered Kippenheim Jews like the Valfers to be ""enemy aliens."" Had their appointment been one day earlier, they might have been able to travel from France to Portugal, where they were booked to sail from Lisbon to America. The Valfers were finally granted visas in August 1942, just weeks after the Germans shifted their policy toward Jews within their sphere from expulsion to extermination. The Valfers were never able to book passage on another ship; instead, they were deported ""to the east"" in the fall of 1942, and murdered at Auschwitz.

Hedy's parents, Hugo and Bella, met the same end. In her final letter to Hedy, Bella wrote: ""Continue to be always good and honest, carry your head high and never lose your courage. Don't forget your dear parents.""

What's most chilling about Dobbs's book is how his account of the early years of World War II echoes our politics today. Xenophobia, isolationism, a fear of destructive infiltrators and an aversion to more war all conspired to keep refugee quotas low, when they were filled at all. Robert Reynolds, a Democratic senator from North Carolina, thundered in a Senate speech that ""if I had my way I would today build a wall about the United States so high and so secure that not a single alien or foreign refugee from any country upon the face of the earth could possibly scale or ascend it."" It was sentiments like his that may have kept Franklin Roosevelt from raising immigration quotas and accounted for obstructionist (and anti-Semitic) State Department policies.","Michael Dobbs's ""The Unwanted"" describes the plight of European Jews trying to escape extermination by the Nazis.",8ffbdc04-3a88-5901-9c38-be158e242f86,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/03/books/review/03Altman1/03Altman1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=b24c53ed327ca65a34ba8aead0bb27a3166f86f5b1ca49a98a1e42e2f3c3cced&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Nazi Brownshirts gather with the Kippenheim fireman&rsquo;s band, 1935.",8ffbdc04-3a88-5901-9c38-be158e242f86,N24News/imgs/8ffbdc04-3a88-5901-9c38-be158e242f86.jpg,13

""I questioned whether I was gay enough to be on a show called 'Queer Eye,'"" he writes in his first cookbook, ""Antoni in the Kitchen,"" which entered the Advice & How-To list last week at No. 2. ""And, really, was I enough of a food guy?""

As the recipes reveal, Porowski cooks not to impress, but to connect. There's the souvlaki his mother craved while pregnant with him, and the peanut butter and Nutella balls he keeps on hand for when the munchies hit (""I'm not gonna dance around this,"" he writes. ""Most of my late teens and 20s were spent high""). He says now, ""I approached the book ... by making it deeply personal, and looking at it as a memoir.""

If the cuisines in the book sound geographically scattered -- ""Jonny's Queso Blanco,"" ""Frenchified Latkes,"" ""Easy Bastardized Ramen,"" ""Chickpea Masala"" -- that's because they are. The son of Polish-Canadian parents in Montreal, Porowski ""was lucky to be raised in a very diverse community"" where he attended a French international school that hosted an annual event at which families exchanged their native dishes. ""The Buffet of Nations shaped me as an individual,"" he says.

Theater,Review: 'There's Blood at the Wedding' Keeps Outrage Alive Onstage,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/theater/theres-blood-at-the-wedding-review.html,"Rage runs throughout ""There's Blood at the Wedding,"" and it's an anger that both energizes and overwhelms this hourlong mixed-media show.

Theodora Skipitares, the creator and director, has made a specialty of intertwining classic works with contemporary issues -- generally speaking, she'll stage a scene from a well-known drama, then follow that scene with a real-life story. Her ""Traveling Players Present the Women of Troy"" combined a Greek tragedy with testimonies of abused African and Afghan women, while her ""Prometheus Within"" alternated that myth with accounts of modern scientific exploration. They are wondrous pieces.

Here she offers Federico Garcia Lorca's ""Blood Wedding"" alongside the stories of Eric Garner, Sean Bell and other civilians who were killed by the police. It's a bold move, though too often Lorca's play seems shoehorned into making a point rather than supporting an idea: The parallels are less persuasive than they were in previous shows, and audience members unfamiliar with Lorca's plot might get lost.","The play, created and directed by Theodora Skipitares, intertwines Lorca's ""Blood Wedding"" with the stories of Eric Garner and others killed by the police.",a2d66498-0bbb-5efc-8555-2603ac56ed2b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/21/arts/21theresblood-flashlight/21theresblood-flashlight-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=95fd871dc3c38494f1dff90e1e1de440a545f3f092a1f44bfbb5adb3bef2d8c8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Alexa Jordan, left, and Eric Lawrence Taylor, in ""There's Blood at the Wedding,"" created and directed by Theodora Skipitares.

Because I have so many shows to keep up with, it saves time: Any second I spend watching a commercial is time wasted. (This is the respect in which my TV habits are probably least like average viewers -- I rarely see ads.) TiVo still has a far better interface than any cable company set-top box I've encountered.

What could be better: Cable companies are horrible, but particularly in New York City, where nearly all of us live under a de facto one-provider monopoly. (Supposedly I'll soon have the choice of Fios, which feels as if it's been taking longer to complete than the Second Avenue subway.) What maniac likes their cable company?

Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life?

I love gadgets, especially in the kitchen. (Don't get me started on my pressure cooker.) Most recently, I got a Joule sous vide immersion circulator for my birthday. It's a little wand you stick in a container of water to heat it to a precise temperature and keep it there. Meaning if you want to cook a steak to 130 degrees Fahrenheit, it will cook it to precisely 130 degrees Fahrenheit, edge to edge, and not a degree more. (You seal up the food in vacuum wrap or a Ziploc bag.)

What do you and your family do with it?

Just after I got it, our oven broke, and it's taken forever to get it fixed. As a result I've been using the Joule for everything: meats, poached eggs -- you can put sweetened condensed milk in a Mason jar and the Joule will turn it into dulce de leche overnight. As I write this, I'm cooking a whole brisket with it, for the next 72 hours.

How has it blown you away?

Not only is it precise and almost entirely hands-off, it slow-cooks meat in a miraculous way. It can turn a chuck roast into a butter-tender, medium-rare steak.

Technology,Web Defenders Detect Russian Hand in Iranians' Hacking Attempt,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/technology/web-defenders-detect-russian-hand-in-iranians-hacking-attempt.html,"For 18 days last month, a team of computer security experts found themselves engaged in a digital version of hand-to-hand combat with a group of hackers determined to break into the network of a military contractor. Every time the hackers, believed to be Iranian, gained a toehold in one server, the defenders shut down their access. A few days later, the hackers would come in through another digital door, and again the defenders would block them. While dueling with the hackers, the security experts said they encountered something that they had never seen before when dealing with an Iranian cyberattack: a Russian connection. Specifically, they found that the Iranians were using a tool set developed by a known Russian hacker-for-hire and sold in underground Russian forums. The tool had popped up in connection with an attack in Ukraine in 2015, when Russian hackers successfully shut down parts of Ukraine's power grid.

""This is the very first time we've cataloged an attack where Iranian hackers are working with Russian hackers-for-hire,"" Carl Wright, an executive at TrapX, the Silicon Valley security firm that interdicted the hackers last month, said in an interview last week. TrapX says it cannot name the victim of the attack, the details of which have not been reported until now, because of confidentiality agreements. But the intrusion represented a ""historic"" partnership between Iran's hackers and Russians who are auctioning their skills and tools to the highest bidder, said Tom Kellermann, a computer security expert who previously served as the chief cybersecurity officer at Trend Micro, the Tokyo-based security giant, and was a member of a commission advising the Obama administration on online security. ""Iranian hackers have dramatically increased their cyberweaponry and tactical proficiency as a result,"" Mr. Kellermann said. Security experts outside TrapX said that it was possible that the attackers had faked the Internet Protocol address in the attack, and that Iran's hackers had simply grabbed the Russian hacking tool off the web and customized it for their attack.

Still, TrapX researchers said that several web domains used in the attack had been registered to a Russian alias, and that three email addresses continue to be used by a hacker in Russian hacking forums and in the underground web. The security experts had become very familiar with the Iranian hackers, who had gotten the nickname ""OilRig"" because they first emerged in hackings on oil companies in Saudi Arabia and later Israel. The hackers had been moving west, targeting a growing array of military, financial and energy companies in Europe and, more recently, the United States.

Security experts said the Iran's OilRig hackers had become easy to spot over the course of hundreds of attacks on contractors, energy companies and government agencies. By most accounts, these hackers could best be described as the ""B Team,"" not nearly as sophisticated as the Chinese, Russian or Eastern European hackers whom security firms have been monitoring for more than a decade. But what OilRig's hackers lacked in sophistication, they made up for in determination. They did their research. They were patient. When they were caught, they would wait for the dust to settle before trying again. Let Us Help You Protect Your Digital Life

Researchers at TrapX came across the Russian tool set in the course of what Mr. Wright described as a running battle with the Iranian hackers last month. More than 70 percent of the code used in the attack was identical to the code OilRig had used in hundreds of previous assaults on organizations. The targets ranged from oil companies in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, to government agencies and companies in Turkey, Europe and the United States, including a small tech firm in rural Vermont called AI Squared that helps websites serve people with visual impairments.

But in the final stage of the attack, TrapX's defenders saw a big shift in the hackers' methods, tools and techniques. ""It was a departure from anything they've done in over 200 documented attacks,"" said Moshe Ben-Simon, vice president of TrapX Labs, the company's research arm, said in an interview. At one point, the defenders watched as the attackers got close to the part of their clients' network where the most valuable intellectual property was housed. It was in this final stage that the hackers downloaded two new sets of tools. The first was a basic hacker's kit that could do things like steal usernames and passwords. The second tool had never popped up in an OilRig attack before. It was wrapped in encryption and had been designed to evade the techniques investigators use to figure out how a hacking tool works. It took weeks to crack the tool and extract information, Mr. Ben-Simon said. The security researchers found OilRig code used in previous attacks, combined with a type of malware called BlackEnergy that was used in an assortment of attacks, including the 2015 effort by Russian hackers that took out parts of Ukraine's power grid. They also found that the hacking tool was conveying information from the victims' systems to a server that had also popped up in the Ukraine power grid attack. Mr. Wright said evidence also indicated that the hacker was renting out services on the underground web. In the end, TrapX's researchers were able to bait the attackers with a web server containing fake data aimed at tricking them into divulging their tactics, and hopefully frustrating them into giving up. It worked. OilRig's hackers injected their malware into the server, which TrapX then analyzed and used to shut the hackers out of their clients' systems.","While foiling an attack on a military contractor, investigators watched Iranians use a tool that had also been deployed to compromise Ukraine's power grid.",a5d53179-dc4d-5073-ac73-253034a3014d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/13/business/13CYBER-1/13CYBER-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=2ae74a9eb575dbdb534a225f1460065a4c9ce2ac9f4735c6959215a331988b27&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Carl Wright of TrapX Security said the attack was the first in which his firm had determined that Iranian hackers were working with hired Russian hackers.,a5d53179-dc4d-5073-ac73-253034a3014d,N24News/imgs/a5d53179-dc4d-5073-ac73-253034a3014d.jpg,20
Theater,'The Michaels' Review: Dance as Life in Upstate New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/28/theater/the-michaels-review-public-theater.html,"They're speaking more softly in Richard Nelson's Rhinebeck these days, as if a raised voice might upset a tenuous balance. Not that any of the previous seven (and wonderful) family dramas written by Nelson during the past nine years, all set in the Hudson River town of Rhinebeck, N.Y., have ever involved much shouting. But his gentle, truly moving ""The Michaels"" -- which opened at the Public Theater on Sunday, the night on which the play is set -- feels pitched in an even lower key than its predecessors: ""The Apple Family Plays,"" a tetralogy, or the three works that make up ""The Gabriels."" In those pieces, middle-class, economically anxious people, of literary and artistic bents, were apt to become heated and at least a little loud as they navigated the overlap between the state of their country and the state of their homes. I spent election night in 2016 with the fictional Gabriels, an extended, left-leaning family on the verge of having to sell their home, and I couldn't have asked for more sympathetic and soulful company. Like me, they had cast their votes for president of the United States in upstate New York earlier that day. Like me, they were awaiting the results with the fearful sense that whatever happened, an increasingly unmoored and conflicted society was unlikely to be righted overnight. Three years have now passed, and you don't need me to tell you about what has happened in this country during that time. Yet at a moment when you might have expected the air of Rhinebeck to be rent with cries of lamentation worthy of Sophocles, Nelson has cannily turned down the volume. The word ""Trump,"" with a capital T, occurs exactly twice in ""The Michaels,"" and those references are more or less glossed over, as if someone had passed gas at the dinner table.

Please note, though, that the full title of this play is ""The Michaels: Conversations During Difficult Times."" Nelson knows that his characters and his audience are all too aware of the rancorous clamor of the world outside. He also understands that there are moments when people grow tired of arguing, of fretting, of trying to make sense of an irrational universe. This is especially true when there is a crisis at home that demands delicacy. Hence the almost hushed tone of this production, which is directed by Nelson, who makes expert use of his now standard arrangement of tiny suspended microphones, which allow performers to whisper and still be heard. (Scott Lehrer is the sound designer.) I initially took this relative quiet to signify a state of depletion, perhaps even of surrender. Happily, I was wrong. ""The Michaels"" is set in the house of a dying woman, Rose Michael (a perfectly cast Brenda Wehle ), a modern dance choreographer with ovarian cancer. Rose has a new partner , Kate Harris ( Maryann Plunkett ), a retired history teacher. Though Rose's art is celebrated for its exaltation of women's everyday chores (sweeping, mopping, washing), she herself might be described as domestically challenged. It thus falls to Kate to prepare the Sunday night meal for their visitors, who have connections both personal and professional to Rose.

These include two of Rose's former dancers, now middle-aged: Sally Michael (Rita Wolf) and Irenie Walker ( Haviland Morris ). Sally is married to David Michael ( Jay O. Sanders ), an arts manager and producer who is also Rose's former husband. There are also two other, younger women there that night: Lucy ( Charlotte Bydwell ), the daughter of Rose and David, and her cousin, May Smith ( Matilda Sakamoto ). They are helping to prepare a tribute to Rose's career, in which they will perform. Before the evening is over, they will dance for Rose, a performance devised from some of her earlier work. (The resonant, spontaneous-seeming choreography is based on that of the modern dance veteran Dan Wagoner, whose translation to the stage here was overseen by Sara Rudner and Gwyneth Jones .) When they do, the odds are that they will make you cry. There is little forward-moving plot in ""The Michaels,"" even by the uneventful standards of the other Rhinebeck plays. This latest addition shares with its predecessors an emphasis on the preparation of food, in what appears to be a fully functional kitchen.

And like other Rhinebeck plays, this one begins with the cast members bringing order to Jason Ardizzone-West 's set (lighted by the brilliant Jennifer Tipton ). They arrange chairs and tables, unfold rugs, distribute the dishes and foodstuffs required to prepare and serve a meal. Nelson is once again asking us to draw the parallel between what goes into setting up a play and the daily business of setting up a life. Though Nelson nearly always tips a reverential hat to the performing arts in his plays, the sense of art as both a mirror to and ordering force in life is paramount here. The first words spoken (by David) are about being backstage with the cast at a play he was working on, and the sense of its being a charged, almost mystical space -- like that, presumably, from which the cast of ""The Michaels"" has just emerged.

The characters reminisce about working with Rose, and about the relationships that developed and transformed and ended during those collaborations. They go through boxes of old journals and photos, trying to summon what was before it fades from recollection altogether. And while the others speak of Rose's dogged silence on her illness, it appears she has already planned her own funeral. In the midst of life we are in death, and vice versa. Dance comes to seem like a tragically ephemeral form -- and, paradoxically, one capable of endless regeneration. Nelson lets such heady themes grow organically, by stealth, from an ensemble that never, ever seems to be acting. (The invaluable Ms. Plunkett, the show's beating heart, and Mr. Sanders have appeared in all the previous Rhinebeck plays.) Even the dance here, performed in the cluttered kitchen, feels like a natural and necessary extension of the lives on display. Though it takes place in real time, ""The Michaels"" is punctuated by brief blackouts, during which we hear what sounds like someone hungrily inhaling. Or is it exhaling? It is the breath of life, in any case, on the edge of extinction, and of renewal, too. ""The Michaels"" is as hopeful as it is heartbreaking.

Art & Design,What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/arts/design/what-to-see-in-new-york-art-galleries-this-week.html,"Nancy Shaver's exhibitions often overload the senses. They are extravaganzas of stuff, colorful and tactile, mostly society's castoffs recycled into forms that expose false binaries, like high versus low, form versus function, masculine versus feminine and art versus craft. Ms. Shaver operates simultaneously as artist, curator, hoarder and stylist. She is also an astute frequenter of flea markets, seeking items for both her work and her secondhand store, Henry, in Hudson, N.Y. Her latest New York show, at Derek Eller, demonstrates her complex proclivities with special clarity. Its title, ""A Part of a Part of a Part,"" suggests a parsing of her efforts.

Some of the art is cobbled together from found materials or objects, most notably her signature wall pieces, called ""Blockers"": little wood blocks, individually covered with paint, fabric, paper or wallpaper, and arranged into grids, which evoke projects ranging from quilts to scrapbooks to works by Piet Mondrian and Joseph Cornell. A similar process is achieved in a beautiful, porous sculpture, ""Drawing #30 -- Light and Air,"" in which stacks of little thread spools evoke Brancusi's ""Endless Column,"" in embryo. But Ms. Shaver also uses things as they are, frequently in large numbers, as in the ambitious ""Collections -- Love and Work."" It includes wooden drawer knobs; baby hats from China, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan; beaded evening bags; and a handmade snow shovel. (Duchamp, anyone?) Some things have been borrowed from Robin Greeson, a collector of textiles and antiques, including the 19 colorful, exquisitely embroidered mola blouses from Panama. These figure prominently, with numerous ""Blockers,"" in ""Tapestry #3,"" an immense wall installation. A few things lent by Ms. Greeson and other sources are presented in isolation, including a suggestively beaded harem-pant onesie said to have been worn by Nijinsky, and two works by Vanessa Bell, the British artist of Bloomsbury Group fame, the best of which is, fittingly, a textile design. There's more, including 17 small, free-standing ""Sentinel"" pieces. They need either more thought or space, but don't let them stop you. ROBERTA SMITH

Giorgione, Raphael, Caravaggio, Watteau, Gericault, Seurat, Schiele, Boccioni: All of them changed the course of European painting, and all of them died before they were 40. There are entire histories of art that never happened because of war and illness. Another name deserves a place on that list of trailblazers who were gone too soon: Domenico Gnoli, whose unsettling paintings of isolated bodies, clothing and furniture shook up the art world of 1960s Italy, but who was brought down by cancer in 1970, at the age of 36.

Gnoli painted overlooked details of bourgeois Italian life -- a chair, a shoe, a forehead with slicked and parted hair -- at bizarre scales, some on canvases more than six feet wide. The close-ups can be comically dull, as in that of a love seat fitted with a ghastly slipcover of Creamsicle orange, seen from a high angle, and with its back cushion cropped at the top. Or they can be fetishistic: Witness the sickly-shiny gloss of a woman's leather heels, or the evocative dimple of a man's necktie, blown up to five feet square.

Though these paintings are precise, they are not photorealistic. The silk of the necktie, for instance, looks like ridges of Plasticine, while the skin and hair of Gnoli's models recall the waxy figuration of Carlo Carra, Giorgio di Chirico and other Italian predecessors. Gnoli mixed sand into the acrylic paint, which gives them an archaeological undernote. And if his close-ups have a parallel in contemporary American Pop Art, or in the French painting of Narrative Figuration, there is no apparent social engagement here, unless you count the alienated downward gaze and the extreme cropping of the images, which turns the amulets of the borghesi into things ornery, oppressive and comic.

For his videos in the show ""On Non-Visibility,"" at Greene Naftali, Tony Cokes samples statements from political speeches, Twitter feeds and stand-up comedy routines, and displays them in stark white lettering against bright monochrome backgrounds, accompanied by post-punk pop music. ""It's called the 'American Dream' 'cause you have to be asleep to believe it,"" one video says, quoting the comedian George Carlin. In another video, a deliciously mournful tune by the Smiths accompanies an essay-like text that considers how television images helped mobilize the civil rights movement. Other works ruminate on the United States military's use of loud and ceaseless pop music to torture Muslim prisoners (""The New York Sun called it 'mood music for jolting your jihadi'""), or incendiary tweets and remarks by Donald J. Trump, Lars von Trier and Kanye West. Made over the last 30 years, the work here feels very postmodern, very 1980s, since it leans heavily on appropriation, pastiche, critical theory and graphic design. And yet it feels fresh -- partly because of renewed interest in text-based art by people like Barbara Kruger, Jenny Holzer and Gretchen Bender, and partly because the media manipulation and coercion that Mr. Cokes identifies has become more exaggerated today. Since Mr. Cokes's video works are essentially essays, set to music, the only problem is that they challenge your reading-in-the-gallery endurance. More than once, I felt my energy and attention flagging -- only to be yanked in again by a punchy Gang of Four pop song. Since the work here is often about how music and words can be used in sinister and destructive ways, it's also thrilling to experience them employed to critical and enlightened ends.

Rita McBride's installation ""Particulates,"" at Dia:Chelsea, is like something out of a sci-fi movie. When you approach the door to the gallery, a sign warns you of ""DANGER"" from laser radiation. It says, ""Do not attempt to make contact with any laser beams!!"" -- the perfect setup for a film scene in which hapless visitors accidentally touch a beam and gain- a superpower or travel through time. The work inside maintains this impression. As you step into the cavernous, murky gallery, you're confronted by green beams of light -- lines that rotate as they extend from one end of the space to the other in a shape that's called a hyperboloid of revolution. Mist machines create clouds of condensation that roll on and off the beams, which appear to be moving, too: The green lights seem to snake along, as if on a network of conveyor belts. Getting closer reveals activity inside the beams. The lasers illuminate water droplets and bits of extra-reflective dust left over from when the space was a marble-cutting shop. These particulates swirl around in the light, looking like pixels set free of a screen. For decades, Ms. McBride has been making sculptures of elemental forms (fences, an amphitheater, keys) as a way of questioning how we relate to the constructed components of society. ""Particulates"" marries her interest in geometry -- she's used the hyperboloid before, most famously in her 170-foot-tall public sculpture ""Mae West"" -- to her interest in science fiction. She commissioned stories in that genre for a book to accompany this show, and previously created a collaborative sci-fi novel. Working with light, a new medium for Ms. McBride, allows her to achieve something both thoroughly material and profoundly otherworldly. Even as the installation illuminates the hidden life of the space it's in, it feels like a portal to another dimension, shimmering with the possibilities of an unknown future.

Dance,A Ballerina Steps Out — as a Choreographer,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/arts/dance/11lovette.html,"On a recent Saturday afternoon, Lauren Lovette surveyed her dancers before sliding into a split -- one of her go-to positions when she's contemplating a step -- and rose suddenly to move through a dynamic passage in her new ballet. She calls this part ""soft serve."" In it, dancers line up along a diagonal and pirouette away as their arms swirl above their heads like curlicues topping a dip of Dairy Queen. She made some tweaks; her dancers peeled away from the line with more refinement but no less verve. ""I think that's going to work,"" she said, half to herself. ""I believe it."" Ms. Lovette, a principal with New York City Ballet, frequently uses that phrase when assessing her choreography, which, like her dancing, is lush. ""That's when you know it's good,"" said Indiana Woodward, one of the leads in Ms. Lovette's new work. ""Because she believes whatever you just gave to her."" This fall, Ms. Lovette, 24, is working from that place of conviction. Ms. Lovette, one of two women who will unveil new works at City Ballet's fall gala on Sept. 20 -- the other is the choreographer Annabelle Lopez Ochoa -- is under some pressure. Last year, City Ballet commissioned works by four men, which had people wondering: Where are the women? Female choreographers remain rare in classical ballet, and Ms. Lovette knows it; she doesn't want to coast.

With ""For Clara,"" her 15-minute work -- she was given a time limit -- featuring a cast of 17, she has chosen a dense, classical score: Schumann's Introduction and Concert Allegro, Op. 134. ""I haven't choreographed anything in six years, so going into this whole process was scary,"" she said. ""I listened to the music and I loved it. That was number one."" Susan Walters, who will perform its piano solo, said: ""It's like a complete concerto. Everything is large except for the amount of time."" Ms. Lovette had been at it only a week but said that she already found that her nerves had calmed. She was sleeping through the night. ""Solidly,"" she said during a rehearsal break at the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet. ""I've had a couple of rehearsals where I get in the room and have five faces staring at me like, O.K., what's happening?"" she said. ""I'm like, 'No idea!' But I like the stuff that happens when I'm at that mental-empty place. That's so cool, because in already a short amount of time, I'm learning to trust myself. It's empowering. It's because when you do something scary, you get stronger. Always.""

Since Ms. Lovette joined the company in 2010, Peter Martins, its ballet master in chief, has approached her every year about returning to choreography. He had seen her dances when she took part in the Student Choreography Workshop at the school. And every year, Ms. Lovette gave him the same answer: She needed to focus on dancing. After he promoted her to principal in 2015, she said he told her, ""You have no excuse."" This time when Mr. Martins asked if she would choreograph a ballet for the fall season, she accepted; later, she said, she thanked him for giving her, a woman, a chance. ""He said, 'No, no, no, no -- I'm not giving you this because you're a woman. I'm giving this to you because I think you're good, and I believe in you.' That was really important for me to hear. I'm glad to put that thought out of my mind. It's just junky."" ""For Clara"" is named for Schumann's wife, a musician and composer. Though Schumann dedicated it to Brahms, the score was a birthday gift for Clara in 1853; she loved the music and performed it throughout Europe. ""She wanted it to be something,"" Ms. Lovette said. ""I feel there's a responsibility there, too. I thought if I could do anything in a small way, I could give this to her."" Ms. Lovette discovered it on Spotify, but to her disappointment her musician friends either dismissed it or hadn't heard of it. One day, she asked Ms. Walters if she could play a recording of it for her. Ms. Walters stopped her five minutes in. ""She was like, 'Lauren, I love this piece, and I want to play it really badly,'"" Ms. Lovette said. Even though she said she doesn't know what it means yet, she can see that her ballet, which features costumes by Narciso Rodriguez, is personal. ""It's pieces of my life,"" Ms. Lovette said. ""It's me getting out different things that I've felt over the years.""

In it, Emilie Gerrity and Chase Finlay are a couple at the start of a relationship; another pair, Unity Phelan and Zachary Catazaro, are more tempestuous, even violent, as they go to battle in a pas de deux. ""And then there's this catalyst that keeps coming out,"" Ms. Lovette said of Ms. Woodward's role. ""Piano riffs go down, and I see Indiana always with her fiery, free spirit. She is like that as a person: independent and strong, but happy. The music crescendos into Indiana's solo: She doesn't really need anyone the whole ballet. She doesn't have a partner. I like that."" If Ms. Lovette is represented by anyone in her ballet, it would seem to be Ms. Woodward, who exudes a kind of independence in her role. Ms. Woodward sees the connection, too. ""I want to try and carry her through the piece,"" Ms. Woodward explained. ""I feel Lauren when I'm dancing."" There are probably other references to Ms. Lovette's life in her ballet, however veiled. Until last fall, she was engaged to Mr. Finlay; now she is his choreographer. ""I think it's healing all around,"" she said, adding that there was a new dynamic between them. ""I wasn't sure how that would be. I always follow my gut, but sometimes I'm like, 'Are you sure, gut?'"" Ms. Lovette has also relished the opportunity to use another part of her brain. In her private life, she likes to make things: She cooks, she crochets, she knits, she sketches, and she makes collages. ""I pull trash off the street and I turn it into stuff and hang it on my walls,"" she said. ""I like a lot of artistic things outside of dance, but usually they're just for me. They don't get judged by anybody. But this is O.K. -- because it's still for me.""","For Lauren Lovette, a New York City Ballet principal, ""When you do something scary, you get stronger.

Theater,'Pamplona' Is Canceled After Stacy Keach Falls Ill,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/04/theater/goodman-theater-cancels-pamplona-stacy-keach.html,"The Goodman Theater in Chicago will cancel the remaining performances of ""Pamplona,"" a world-premiere play by Jim McGrath starring the veteran actor Stacy Keach as Ernest Hemingway.

The announcement of the cancellations came on Friday, three days after the play's troublesome opening night. Midway through the performance, the theater's artistic director, Robert Falls, halted the production after Mr. Keach, 76, ""appeared to become confused and lost his way many times,"" according to The Chicago Tribune.

Keach received medical testing following the premiere, and doctors advised that he rest and recuperate, according to the actor's family. The Goodman Theater will contact ticket holders with refund details and alternative offers.

Science,A Bumblebee Gets New Protection on Obama's Way Out,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/science/endangered-bee.html,"The Obama administration, rushing to secure its environmental legacy, has increased protection for a humble bumblebee. The rusty-patched bumblebee, once common across the continental United States, has been designated an endangered species by the Fish and Wildlife Service: the country's first bumblebee, and the first bee from the lower 48 states, to be added to the register. Seven bees were previously listed as endangered, but they are found only in Hawaii. Since the late 1990s, the population of the rusty-patched bumblebee has declined by nearly 90 percent, a result of a combination of factors, including exposure to pesticides, climate change, habitat loss and disease, federal wildlife officials said. The species, once found in 28 states, the District of Columbia and two Canadian provinces, is found today only in small pockets of its once-sprawling habitat. The designation will accelerate efforts to protect the bees' habitat and to reduce the use of pesticides that are killing them. It is the latest in a flurry of last-minute efforts to protect the environment and preserve President Obama's legacy on climate change. In the last month, he has issued a permanent ban on offshore oil and gas drilling in large areas of the Arctic and much of the Eastern Seaboard; announced two new national monuments in Utah and Nevada, protecting 1.65 million acres of federal land; and denied six permits for oil exploration in the Atlantic, partly because the seismic testing harms marine animals.

And the announcement about the bee came a day after the Fish and Wildlife Service said that human-caused climate change is the biggest threat to the polar bear's survival, and that without significant action to fight global warming, the bears will most likely vanish. Federal wildlife officials noted that the process of listing a species as endangered can take years, sometimes even decades. More than 300 species have been listed during the Obama administration, second only to the more than 500 species listed under President Bill Clinton. During the George W. Bush administration, just 62 species were added to the list. Noah Greenwald, endangered species director for the Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental advocacy group, said activists were worried ""that we're headed into another period like that, where hostility from the administration toward protecting endangered species causes them to shut the listing program down."" The incoming Trump administration, however, would need to undertake a lengthy process to declare the rusty-patched bumblebee population recovered if it wished to reverse this week's decision, and it would be required by law to justify its action on scientific grounds.

Around the world, the populations of bees, butterflies and other insects that promote plant growth are crashing, a threat not only to biodiversity but also to the global food supply. A study last year from a group associated with the United Nations warned that an increasing number of species that aid the growth of hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of food each year face extinction. ""Obviously, it's sad that anything has to get on the endangered list, but this really provides a great opportunity,"" said Dennis vanEngelsdorp of the University of Maryland, a bee expert who applauded the government's decision. ""When you're talking about saving the bumblebees, what you're really talking about is saving the community."" The kinds of measures that could protect the rusty-patched bumblebee could help many other pollinators, as well, by restoring habitats and food sources and restricting the use of pesticides -- especially nicotine-based insecticides that have been linked to the decline in bee species. Such measures are especially important with native bumblebees, Dr. vanEngelsdorp noted, as opposed to honeybees, which are maintained in large colonies and trucked around the country for commercial pollination. The service is reviewing three other species of bees to determine whether they ought to be listed as endangered as well: Franklin's bumblebee, the western bumblebee and the yellow-banded bumblebee. When a species is listed as endangered, the Fish and Wildlife Service is required to design a recovery plan, which is often carried out by other agencies, nongovernmental organizations, universities and tribes. Other federal agencies have to check that their actions will not hurt an endangered species or its habitat, particularly when it comes to land use planning. Bumblebees are particularly effective pollinators because, though they seem to prefer native flowers, they will pollinate pretty much anything and can fly in lower temperatures and lower light conditions than many other insects. They also use the technique of ""buzz pollination,"" in which they grab the pollen-producing part of the flower in their jaws and vibrate their wings, shaking the pollen loose, a process that seems to benefit plants like tomatoes, peppers and cranberries, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.

Bumblebees are particularly important to agriculture, but agriculture is often unkind to them. A number of factors have reduced the habitat available to bees, including the use of pesticides and other chemicals, the domination of vast amounts of farmland by a single crop, and the use of some genetically modified crops and herbicides that prevent the growth of weeds in fields and wildflowers along their borders. Climate change may also be shrinking the bees' habitat, because of drought, rising temperatures, more storms and mismatches in timing: Plants may start to flower at times when the bees are not ready to pollinate. It also presents serious threats to the migration patterns of monarch butterflies and other pollinators, such as honeybees. While these species may not be as visible or as charismatic as polar bears or other mammals whose existences are threatened by a changing climate, placing them on the endangered list is a victory for the species and those who fight for it. ""Now we have a symbol to rally around,"" Dr. vanEngelsdorp said.","The administration added the rusty-patched bumblebee, which once covered 28 states but is threatened by pesticides, disease and climate change, to the endangered species list.",933bf136-7efe-558b-aae7-ddbc354f5d6a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/11/science/11BEES/12BEES-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=1608e39f9a993e639e185e3e709a3d9cb0f05e1cbb7215af4d00cc17f184e290&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The rusty-patched bumblebee, once common across the continental United States, has been designated an endangered species.",933bf136-7efe-558b-aae7-ddbc354f5d6a,N24News/imgs/933bf136-7efe-558b-aae7-ddbc354f5d6a.jpg,2
Art & Design,Can a New Arts Center Revitalize Provincetown?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/arts/design/provincetown-arts-center.html,"The backyard of the Mary Heaton Vorse home in Provincetown, which has been restored by its new owner, the interior designer Ken Fulk.

The backyard of the Mary Heaton Vorse home in Provincetown, which has been restored by its new owner, the interior designer Ken Fulk. The flag, ""Ryan's Rainbow,"" was created for the house by the photographer Ryan McGinley.

PROVINCETOWN, Mass. -- There was only one destination of choice for the literary set looking to leave New York City during the sweltering summer of 1916: Provincetown, at the outermost tip of Cape Cod. Once there, writers like John Reed and Louise Bryant, the playwright Eugene O'Neill, and an assorted cast of Greenwich Village radicals all converged on the sprawling 18th-century, eight-bedroom home of Mary Heaton Vorse, a celebrated labor reporter and the grande dame of the avant-garde. The goal of those heady salons? ""Free love and communism!"" quipped Ken Fulk, the new owner of the Vorse house. Yet rather than flipping the home after his $1.17 million purchase, or dividing it into condos -- the fate of so many other antique buildings in this town where nearly 75 percent of the homes are now second homes or owned by investors -- he has spent $1.25 million more to meticulously restore its interiors to that 1916 moment and open it to the public on July 2 as one of New England's newest arts centers. Mr. Fulk hopes his move will help shore up Provincetown's fraying cultural vitality and reconnect it to younger generations of artists who have been priced out. ""I grew up loving historical homes and the patina of time, understanding that true imperfections have a place,"" explained Mr. Fulk, an interior designer who divides his time between San Francisco and Provincetown. Already living with his husband, Kurt Wootton, across the street from the Vorse home, Mr. Fulk viewed restoring its dilapidated state as an irresistible challenge. He has gained a national reputation -- and a devoted clientele who reportedly pay seven-figure sums for his handiwork -- by fusing an over-the-top theatricality with a passion for the historical. Now he's setting his sights on Provincetown, whose longstanding art colony sees itself under siege from many of the same gentrifying financial pressures as the Bay Area. ""Quirkiness, eccentricity, is what Provincetown is all about and it's one of the great attributes that drew me here,"" he said. ""This place will never be the Hamptons.""

The pandemic complicates that equation. Provincetown, like so many other places economically dependent on summer tourism, remains conflicted over the pace of reopening as a second wave of Covid-19 looms. With a townwide ban on indoor entertainment, Twenty Summers and the Provincetown Theater postponed their seasonal programs, while the Provincetown Film Society -- forced to reschedule its annual film festival and shutter its year-round movie theater -- recently announced the layoff of its entire full-time staff, including the C.E.O. ""We may not have a packed house, but the need this summer is going to be more profound, not less,"" explained Mr. Fulk of the Vorse home's opening. To that end he's pressing ahead with an August fund-raising dinner for the Provincetown Theater honoring the playwright Charles Busch -- though it's now recast as a ""spaced lawn party.""

Mr. Fulk said he is also going forward with the July opening of an art exhibition inside the home ""at whatever capacity is allowed, even if it's just one person at a time."" The show, ""Intimate Companions,"" curated by Joe Sheftel, features 50 figurative works by 36 artists with a Provincetown connection, each exploring queer culture and the distinct sense of place embodied by the town itself -- from the painter Paul Cadmus, a mainstay in the late 1940s, to more recent visitors including the painters Jen Bradley and Jenna Gribbon. A five-by-eight-foot flag created by the photographer Ryan McGinley has been mounted on a 30-foot-high pole. Joshua Prager, a New York City-based author and co-founder of Twenty Summers, recalled that a dinner gathering which Mr. Fulk hosted had raised $150,000 for his event series -- three years' worth of its budget in one single evening. While Mr. Prager didn't discount the sense of dread that many artists feel as more and more prominent names move into town, sending rents soaring without any boost to the regional art market, he took the long view. ""What separates Provincetown from the Hamptons is a lot more than just money,"" he said. ""It's an informal space here. People's shirts are open, or they aren't wearing shirts at all.""

For his part, Mr. Dowd was more ambivalent about the future of the art colony. While he applauded Mr. Fulk's restoration of the Vorse home, he feared that such efforts were ultimately self-defeating. ""Have I been doing the devil's work in trying to make it look a certain way here?"" mused Mr. Dowd, a member of Provincetown's Historic District Commission, who has spent years fighting the wholesale gutting of historic buildings. ""It's a double-edged sword, trying to make things look more historically authentic,"" he explained. ""The more you make it like that, the more it hastens its demise as a living, working, thriving community. Because the money sweeps in from people who see the cachet in a pretty place to play, and it's taken away from the people who created it in the first place."" What Provincetown's artists really needed, he stressed, was cheap rent and low-budget studios. While there have been some fledgling efforts, including the Commons, a new nonprofit co-working space, Mr. Dowd wondered if it was too little and too late. Today's art school graduates simply bypass Provincetown altogether, he noted, leaving the art colony to essentially age into extinction. ""If you want to have a thriving art scene, you need youth, you need places for them to paint, and you need places for them to live,"" he added, noting Provincetown's dire shortage of these very elements. ""There are no easy answers, but if people are going to do million-dollar fund-raisers, the focus should be a little more on that.""

Erika Wastrom, a painter of beguiling portraits who graduated from Boston University's M.F.A. program in 2012, would appear to be part of the local artistic continuum: She grew up as a 13th-generation Cape Codder, studying art with the well-known Provincetown figures Jim Peters and Vicky Tomayko, each of whom moved to Provincetown in the mid-80s as fellows at the Fine Arts Work Center and then stuck around. Ms. Wastrom's own work is now exhibited at Provincetown's GAA Gallery. ""I love being part of a place that has a special relationship to painting,"" she said with a mournful laugh, ""except that I'm not part of that place."" Ms. Wastrom lives a good hour south of Provincetown in Barnstable -- where homes are far more affordable, especially for someone starting a family. But raising two kids while teaching full time, and still cramming in regular studio sessions, doesn't leave much time for driving up to Provincetown to be a part of its creative community.

Many of Ms. Wastrom's fellow Boston University grads headed straight for New York City. To them, ""Provincetown is a place from the past,"" she said. But New York and what she deemed its artistic ""cookie-cutter molds"" held little appeal for her. That left two options: ""I could try to be an adjunct at some random university in Idaho. Or I could move back to a place that's inspiring to me and try to make work -- and a living -- there,"" she explained. ""I'm not a landscape painter. But I am interested in color. And that part of the day when the light starts to disappear? There's no color like that anywhere else."" That makes perfect sense to Mr. Fulk. ""There's something magical about this crazy little sliver of sand,"" he said, citing a passage from Mary Vorse's 1942 memoir ""Time and the Town,"" where she speaks of the ""cosmic quality"" of setting down her writing and taking daily hikes through the woods to hidden ponds, or across the dunes to gaze out at the Atlantic Ocean. ""I knew that I would never be quite so happy again,"" she wrote. ""I had recaptured the happiness I had as a girl, and yet I had the freedom of a woman. I had my house and my children, and yet I had the gaiety that comes only, as a rule, with the irresponsibility of youth."" And the transformation of the Vorse house? ""It's a little bit of a folly that we're doing this,"" Mr. Fulk said. ""But it's utterly Provincetown to me."" The town's offbeat essence endured, he insisted, even in the face of this summer's challenges: ""There's still drag queens in the street -- but now they have masks on.""","In saving the Mary Heaton Vorse home, Ken Fulk hopes to help rescue an arts colony under siege from gentrification.

Economy,Trump and Congress Both Want Tax Cuts. The Question Is Which Ones.,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/business/economy/trump-and-congress-both-want-tax-cuts-the-question-is-which-ones.html,"Trump and Congress Both Want Tax Cuts. The Question Is Which Ones.

Several economic issues divide many Republicans in Congress from Donald J. Trump, the Republican president-elect. Free trade versus tariffs to limit imports. Immigration reform versus a border wall. Cutting Social Security and other benefit programs versus protecting them. But one economic matter unites just about every member of the Republican party: support for tax cuts, particularly for those at the top of the income ladder. Whatever fault lines have emerged during this campaign, the belief that lower taxes targeted at ""job creators"" will unleash a roar of economic growth crosses them. Both Donald J. Trump and Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, have released tax proposals that hark back to the supply-side programs of the Reagan and George W. Bush eras, promising that the multitrillion-dollar cost will be more than offset by the extra revenue flowing into the Treasury from the growth that will follow. ""Tax reform is the thing that always unites Republicans,"" said William Gale, a co-director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center and a former economic adviser to President George H.W. Bush. ""I would guess that that's Item 1 on the congressional agenda.""

House Republicans already have a fairly detailed blueprint for Congress and the White House to follow. ""My sense is that Trump doesn't really have the details of a tax reform package that he wants,"" Mr. Gale said. ""He has broad ideas, and then the Congress will go at it and pin down the details. The House blueprint seems like the place to start and may be fairly close to where they finish."" That does not mean Mr. Trump will not have his own ideas. Mr. Gale expects a Trump White House to insist on continuing a deduction for interest paid on debt-financed projects, a provision dear to real estate developers. (The House plan proposes ending the deduction, instead allowing businesses to immediately deduct expenses and investments.) While sweeping tax cuts were never a crusading theme of Mr. Trump's, they have long been near the top of Mr. Ryan's agenda. And Mr. Trump has suggested he would be happy to let Congress take the lead. ""They'll have to take the temperature of the White House to see what pieces of Trump's campaign promises have to be incorporated into that,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now president of the American Action Forum, a conservative economic advocacy group. ""But I assume the House tax plan is the starting point.""

There is certainly a significant overlap. Both would cut income tax rates across the board and keep rates low on income from investments, an approach intended to spur savings that effectively guarantees the juiciest cuts for the wealthy. An analysis of Mr. Trump's latest plan by the Tax Policy Center calculated that the top 0.1 percent of the population, those with incomes over $3.7 million in 2016, would receive an average 14 percent reduction, or about $1.1 million. Households in the middle of the scale -- those earning between about $48,000 and $83,000 today -- would get a 1.8 percent tax cut worth on average $1,010, while the poorest fifth of Americans will gain about $110, or 1 percent of their income. Both Mr. Trump's and Mr. Ryan's plans eliminate a deep-rooted Republican bete noire, the estate tax on bequests to heirs. Under today's code, it falls on only 0.2 percent of households, since it applies only to estates worth more than $10.9 million for a married couple. Their plans, in conjunction with rejecting the Affordable Care Act, drop the 3.8 percent surtax on high earners' investment income, which helps pay for health coverage for lower-income Americans. Both also take aim at the alternative minimum tax, which was originally established to make sure that those earning high incomes do not entirely escape taxes by invoking certain deductions but now falls mostly on the upper middle class in affluent regions of the country.

Lowering the tax on capital gains -- which also benefits the wealthy the most -- draws wide support among the leadership headed for both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue in 2017 as well.
* Retail earnings and Black Friday: the week in business.
* Elizabeth Holmes will resume her testimony in her fraud trial. Republicans say they also want to provide some tax cuts for those lower on the income ladder. Senator Marco Rubio, who was re-elected to represent Florida after his failed presidential bid, favors increasing the child tax credit; Mr. Ryan, who is working closely with Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, supports expanding the earned-income tax credit to poor working families without children. Mr. Trump has suggested he wants to provide tax cuts to two-income families with children as well.

For all the similarities, there are important differences as well. The biggest contrast between Mr. Trump's and Mr. Ryan's tax approaches can be seen on the corporate side, where they differ on how to tax capital investment and debt. They also differ on the proposed tax rate for most small businesses. The most compelling target for business tax reform is the roughly $2.6 trillion that American corporations like Apple, General Electric, Microsoft and Pfizer have kept abroad on an extended tax holiday, out of the Internal Revenue Service's reach. ""Everyone agrees that the foreign tax situation is ludicrous because it doesn't raise any revenue and keeps several trillion dollars abroad,"" said Robert Pozen, a senior lecturer at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management. Mr. Trump has said he was determined to get multinational companies to pay their American tax bills every year, although the sting would not be as great since he would also cut corporate rates and allow credits for foreign taxes paid. By contrast, the House Republicans have been pushing for what is known as a territorial system, which would tax all businesses solely on what goods and services they sold in the United States. The flaw in a territorial approach, Mr. Pozen and other economists have pointed out, is that it encourages businesses to shop the world for lower tax rates, ultimately shifting even more profits and jobs overseas. ""Why is that good for a president who wants to have more jobs and more facilities in the U.S.?"" Mr. Pozen asked. ""I don't see how you can reconcile those goals under a territorial system.""","Tax reform is one thing President-elect Donald J. Trump and Speaker Paul Ryan can agree on, broadly, though the specifics can get thorny.",b4772c77-6d0d-5a5c-a5fe-6bdc384d2edf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/13/business/13TAXES/13TAXES-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=88b4a357b78a68ed9e5f8e25fa855b340f3704efaa50b7dceceb612414972bb7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"President-elect Donald J.

New Privacy Rules Could Make This Woman One of Tech's Most Important Regulators



DUBLIN -- If Mark Zuckerberg doesn't know who Helen Dixon is, he will soon. From an unassuming townhouse in the Irish capital, Ms. Dixon, the country's data protection commissioner, leads an agency that was once a bureaucratic backwater. Employees share offices and have few of the perks available in Facebook's building nearby: The main free amenities here are water, coffee and tea. Yet Ms. Dixon will soon gain vast new authority to investigate and fine Facebook, as well as an array of other technology giants with regional headquarters in Ireland. Amid increased concerns over online privacy, a sweeping new European privacy law could make her one of the world's most consequential regulators. She is eager to test her newfound power. But the question remains whether her tiny agency is able -- or willing -- to stand up to tech behemoths of Silicon Valley.

Europe's new General Data Protection Regulation is seen by experts as the world's most aggressive set of internet privacy rules. It is expected to come into force on May 25, and it will give more than 500 million people living in the European Union the right to keep companies from collecting personal data, or to have it deleted. Regulators like Ms. Dixon will be able to fine companies up to 4 percent of global revenue -- equivalent to about $1.6 billion for Facebook. [Read more about what the new European privacy rules mean for you.] The privacy law highlights broader skepticism of Silicon Valley in Europe, where regulators have punished companies for violating tax and antitrust laws, not doing enough to stop the spread of hate speech and misinformation online, and intrusively gobbling up data on consumers. Ireland in particular is taking center stage in the wide-ranging battle. The country is the European headquarters for data-hungry companies including Airbnb, Apple, Facebook, Google, Twitter and Microsoft, which owns LinkedIn. If companies do not comply with the law, Ms. Dixon said, ""they will suffer consequences.""

 But for all the tough talk, the reality is that her agency subsists on an annual budget of 7.5 million euros, equivalent to $9 million. That's roughly as much revenue as the companies she oversees generate over all in 10 minutes. Facebook, which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram, has hundreds of people globally working on data protection regulation alone, including lawyers and privacy experts hired in Dublin.

Ms. Dixon, whose father was an army officer and mother a schoolteacher, grew up in a small town in central Ireland before moving to Dublin for university. She worked for companies including the business software firm Citrix Systems before moving into government. She later received a postgraduate diploma in computer science. Fittingly for her current position, Ms. Dixon guards her privacy. She will not share her age, other than saying she is in her ""40s,"" and she has become more careful with data since taking the job. She does not use Facebook or Instagram (though she does have a LinkedIn profile). Let Us Help You Protect Your Digital Life

Since taking over in 2014, Ms. Dixon has successfully lobbied for more funding and got the headquarters put back in Dublin. A move to a bigger office is in the works. She has hired lawyers, investigators and engineers. The staff will total 140 this year, up from 30 when she joined, with plans to reach 200 in the next few years, if budget increases are approved. But if data privacy is truly a priority globally, Ms. Dixon said, more resources are needed. Her office is actually among the better funded privacy agencies globally, but is still a minnow compared with, say, Ireland's financial services regulator, which has a budget about 40 times greater. ""The question for governments is, how much enforcement do we want to do, how seriously do we want to take the risk to our fundamental rights and freedoms in this area?"" said Ms. Dixon, carrying a bound copy of the new law. ""We need the funding and resources commensurate with the level of importance. This office would suggest it should be far more highly resourced.""

Budgetary constraints are not new to regulators overseeing powerful industries. But privacy groups worry that without strong oversight, the European rules, years in the making, will do little to crimp the power of Silicon Valley. There is evidence those concerns are well founded. In a Reuters survey of privacy regulators in 24 European Union countries, 17 said they did not have the needed funding or legal powers to enforce data protection regulation. Ireland did not participate in the survey. Ms. Dixon must also contend with skepticism among privacy advocates, stemming largely from Ireland's history of lax oversight of the technology industry. Her predecessors are faulted for not taking earlier action against Facebook, even when complaints were filed years ago about data-mining practices similar to those eventually used by the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The European Commission in 2016 also ordered Ireland to recoup about $15.6 billion in unpaid taxes from Apple. (The decision is being appealed.) ""The culture has to be changed,"" said Max Schrems, a Austria-based lawyer and online privacy advocate who filed the earlier complaints against Facebook. ""You can have the best law, but if nobody enforces it, then you're not going to go anywhere.""

Advocates of the new law say it is already having a positive impact and that oversight is spread out. A new European Data Protection Board will help coordinate investigations and pool resources across European Union countries, giving regulators outside Ireland the ability to bring action. The data protection regulation also allows private groups to recruit consumers into class-action-style complaints -- not as common in Europe as the United States -- that could result in sizable damages against businesses. A looming question, however, is how much people really care. Ms. Dixon cited Facebook's most recent financial report, which showed growing user numbers, revenue and profit, despite the Cambridge Analytica scandal. ""We should be acting as data protection authorities in the name of data subjects, but you often as a regulator in this space have the feeling that you're not mandated by the general public,"" she said. ""Either they don't care or they actively oppose what we're doing."" Representatives from the technology industry have made regular visits to the converted 18th-century Georgian home used by Ms. Dixon's team. Aware that a public backlash is putting pressure on regulators to rein in Silicon Valley, Facebook and others have been courting Ms. Dixon, putting forward their case that their data protection policies comply with the new European law. ""We've really leapt into explaining what we've done and the thinking that's gone into that,"" said Stephen Deadman, Facebook's global deputy chief privacy officer.

Education,New All-Digital Curriculums Hope to Ride High-Tech Push in Schoolrooms,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/03/education/new-all-digital-curriculums-hope-to-ride-high-tech-push-in-schoolrooms.html,"English language curriculums built entirely on a digital platform -- replacing written textbooks, worksheets or printed study guides -- are about to enter the market from several companies, with promises that they will change the nature of classroom learning across the country. The Obama administration has pledged to provide high-speed Internet connections to 15,000 schools over the next two years, districts are purchasing tablets and laptops for students, and on Friday, President Obama announced $400 million in corporate commitments from the software companies Adobe and Prezi, which will donate software to teachers. Meanwhile, other companies are rushing in. On Monday at an education conference in Austin, Tex., Joel Klein, the former chancellor of New York City public schools and the current chief executive of Amplify, the education unit of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, will introduce a digital English language arts curriculum for middle school. Mr. Klein said the new software, which will run on a variety of devices and is priced at $45 per student a year, includes videos, games and vocabulary apps and allows teachers to track student writing and give feedback directly online. ""This is not a bunch of souped-up PDFs,"" Mr. Klein said, referring to digital versions of print documents.

McGraw Hill, the textbook publisher, will also announce this week that it has signed a partnership with StudySync, a company that creates digital English curriculum tools that have been deployed in 22,000 classrooms and are priced at about a third of Amplify's rate. Scholastic Inc., the children's publisher, is already a familiar player with Read 180, a digital curriculum that targets struggling readers and is currently used by about one million students in 40,000 classrooms across the country. This year, the company also introduced Codex, a more general middle school English digital curriculum that is being used in 4,300 middle school classrooms. Among the features of Amplify's digital curriculum is the ability for teachers to see if students really understand vocabulary words when they use them in Twitter-like hashtags and other social media contexts. The company has also embedded videos relating to a range of classic texts that are included in e-reader form within the software. One example: to introduce ""Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,"" the actor Chadwick Boseman, who played Jackie Robinson in the film ""42,"" performs an early scene with chilling intensity. And for a unit on Edgar Allan Poe, students can play a game in which they try to solve the murder of the author, using clues from several poems or stories as well as simulated coroner's reports and crime scene files. Amplify, which introduced a tablet for K-12 schoolchildren last year, has invested about $100 million over the last two and a half years in its education businesses. The new English language arts software is aimed at sixth, seventh and eighth graders.

Larry Berger, the president of Amplify Learning, the curriculum development unit, said the company planned a modest rollout of the product for the coming school year but eventually hoped to capture as much as 25 percent of the market. Technology in classrooms has experienced something of a bumpy rollout: When the Los Angeles Unified School District introduced its $1 billion effort last year to give every student an iPad (loaded with curriculum developed by Pearson, the large textbook and standardized test publisher), students quickly figured out how to hack the devices and wander onto noneducational websites. And Amplify itself had to suspend its tablet launch in Guildford County, N.C., because of safety concerns. (Amplify has since agreed to extend the county's contract for another year at no additional cost so the schools can try the tablets again.) As Amplify introduces its new English curriculum, it could face obstacles from teachers wary of Mr. Klein, whose tenure in the New York City public schools was controversial, and of Mr. Murdoch, whose media conglomerate has been entangled in phone-hacking scandals that could leave educators worried about the company's respect for student privacy. ""Teachers do not trust either Murdoch or Klein,"" said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the country's second-largest teachers union. ""They have a long road to go."" But Ms. Weingarten, who said she had viewed only very preliminary versions of the Amplify digital English curriculum, added: ""They may have done some great things that makes it aligned to critical thinking in a way that people will say, 'Wow, this is fantastic.' "" Mr. Berger said that the Amplify curriculum was designed to meet the Common Core, standards for what students need to know and be able to do that have been adopted by 45 states and the District of Columbia. He said the software had enough material that a teacher could use it daily for fully planned lessons, but that it offered flexibility for teachers who wanted to design their own instruction. ""What we try to do is classroom orchestration and choreography,"" Mr. Berger said, ""but not classroom scripting."" Patricia Depagter, a middle school English teacher in Tampa, Fla., tried Amplify's seventh-grade curriculum for two weeks last month. She initially worried the students ""would just stick their noses into the tablets"" and not interact with each other or write much. Instead, while working on a unit reading Poe's ""The Tell-Tale Heart,"" she said, students ""would get up and walk around to talk to other kids, but would look to the tablet for evidence"" for their discussion. ""It's so much more natural for them to have this technology in their hands.""

Some teachers said they were not interested in committing to a curriculum entirely from one provider. Sandy Hayes, immediate past president of the National Council of Teachers of English and a middle school English teacher in Becker, Minn., said she loved to pull a range of technological options into the classroom, including programs like iMovie, Comic Creator and Garage Band. ""This is the joy of teaching,"" said Ms. Hayes, who had not reviewed Amplify's curriculum, ""being able to express your own creativity."" More generally, some observers questioned whether digital tools would enhance literacy more than superficially. ""Being able to poke at words on screen and have them spin out videos for us could be compelling in the short term,"" said Audrey Watters, who writes about technology and schooling on her blog, Hack Education. ""But I'm not sure it's intellectually fruitful.""","Amplify, part of News Corporation, is one of many companies releasing all-digital curriculums for sale to school districts.",e893771c-7d7f-5c17-9a9d-c0e19021f573,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/03/us/DIGITAL/DIGITAL-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=e23bff0a7f5dfb725419ceb484b7b30786bbcc4d292e1f2456ad8cac8585085e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"A tablet for schools by Amplify, part of News Corporation.

Dance,"Forced Online, Battery Dance Festival Brings the World to You",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/18/arts/dance/battery-dance-festival.html,"Staged in recent years on the bottom tip of Manhattan, with the harbor and the boats and the Statue of Liberty as a backdrop, the Battery Dance Festival could be glorious. If a breeze was blowing and the light was right, the dancing almost didn't need to be distinctive for the experience to be so.

Still, you might discover something wonderful: a dancer or a company you were unlikely to encounter elsewhere. At other times it was too damn hot and the setting sun was blinding. Then the impression that much of the dancing and choreography was not so great -- that the variety of this free, public event had been purchased at the expense of aesthetic discrimination -- could swell.

Well, this year you can factor out the weather as a variable, since the festival, like almost everything else in New York dance, is virtual. The new format is not necessarily a diminishment, at least not in volume. The events started on Friday and continue through Saturday, with a different, themed program each of the nine nights: some 52 entries, more than half of them premieres. (Each program is available online for 10 days.)

In normal years, the festival can seem at once vast and small-time. Its pride is its international reach and scope, the many countries and regions of the world represented. Yet the participants are seldom world-class. It can feel, for better or worse, like a neighborhood event.",The festival's pride is its international reach and scope.

Theater,"Review: With 'Skintight,' Idina Menzel Takes On a Straight Play. Sort Of.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/theater/skintight-review-idina-menzel.html,"Idina Menzel is known for her vocal pyrotechnics, but intensity like hers doesn't really begin in the throat. It's much deeper than that, and thus much richer, which is why she remains the definitive interpreter of musical roles like Maureen in ""Rent,"" the green witch Elphaba in ""Wicked"" and Elsa -- or at least her voice -- in the animated movie ""Frozen."" But there's no point ignoring that she operates at a certain temperature, and even in ""Frozen"" that temperature is hot. So you get an immediate shiver suggesting strange weather when she shows up with all her neurotic engines blazing in the supercool confines of Joshua Harmon's ""Skintight,"" a nonmusical comedy that opened on Thursday at the Roundabout Theater Company's Laura Pels Theater. This is before she even gets to speak. As Jodi Isaac, a Los Angeles lawyer ""hanging on by a thread,"" she instantly looks out of place, vibrating with anxiety in the living room of her father's Horatio Street townhouse. That living room, perfectly rendered by the set designer Lauren Helpern, is a gray monument to punitive good taste. That's because the father, Elliot Isaac, is a world-renowned purveyor of minimalist design, which he sells on the backs of models whose bodies represent a similar perfectionist aesthetic. You don't have to have spent your childhood as the ""Eloise of Studio 54,"" as Jodi did, to recognize the similarities to Calvin Klein.

So this is going to be a Jewish family comedy about youth and beauty, which Elliot (Jack Wetherall) takes very seriously indeed. Apparently Jodi's ex-husband, back in L.A., does too, because he is about to marry an aerobicized young woman of 24. Jodi has come to New York not only to forcibly celebrate her father's 70th birthday, which he'd prefer to ignore, but also to seek paternal solace for this blow to her self-image as a vibrant young woman still claiming to be in her ""very early 40s."" That solace is not forthcoming, and not only because Elliot is a very cold fish. Before Jodi can finish bewailing her ex-husband's child bride, with all the mortifying math that entails, Elliot trumps her with Trey, the 20-year-old Okie hunk he has taken to calling his partner.

All of these and one other key element -- Jodi's 20-year-old son, Benjamin, a queer studies major -- are presented as crisply as a white dress shirt in a box. It only remains to see what everyone's goals will be and how they will cross, clash and (because this is a comedy) eventually coalesce. You anticipate a sleekly enjoyable romp: well made, sexy, with a bit of substance yet light enough for a summer evening. A low bar, perhaps, but ""Skintight"" clears it. Though Jodi is needy and Elliot vain -- and Benjamin sulky and Trey dim -- Mr. Harmon complicates their baseline traits sufficiently to keep them interesting if not especially credible. Trey, for instance, is rude to one of the servants. (There are two, gliding around as if on casters.) Benjamin, who at first seems morally superior, turns out to be blind to his own sense of entitlement. A trustafarian grandson of a near-billionaire, he has the gall to criticize Trey for sponging.

But something's off, and it's not the cast. In her first prominent nonsinging stage role, Ms. Menzel nails Jodi just about perfectly, landing every joke as if on a musical button. Her heat makes sense of the character's contradictions and is beautifully foiled by Mr. Wetherall's lizard sang-froid. As Benjamin, Eli Gelb seems to have walked onto the Laura Pels stage directly from a semiotics course at Brown; and Will Brittain brings dignity to the prototypical dumb jock, even if he is often made to do so while wearing one. (The spot-on costumes are by Jess Goldstein.) So any random 15-minute stretch spent watching ""Skintight"" is likely to prove rewarding; you'll laugh, you'll ogle, you'll tut. And the smoothness of the staging, by the director Daniel Aukin, will keep you from noticing that more and more of those stretches are stretching by without much build. If you've seen Mr. Harmon's earlier plays, that problem may remind you of ""Significant Other,"" in which there's less of a plot than a recurrent situation: A gay guy's female friends keep getting married. Or you may, more happily, recall ""Bad Jews,"" with its omnivorous comic appetite. What you won't think of is ""Admissions,"" recently produced by Lincoln Center Theater, in which the characters have clear agendas at clear odds with one another's. The characters in ""Skintight"" don't have agendas; they have annoyances. (Jodi doesn't mind Elliot's relationship with Trey but wishes he wouldn't call it love.) In any case, whatever these family members need they either have already when the play begins or take no meaningful steps to achieve. That's real privilege -- but not much of a play. You can see how it might have been. Sometimes a flash of unruly emotion or pungent language will briefly illuminate thematic recesses that are otherwise left in the dark. When Elliot, fondling Trey's forearms, says, ""I'd like to have sheets made from your skin,"" you get a sense of what kind of creepy imagination (and commercial savvy) makes someone an Elliot Isaac. And when Benjamin, who has been spending a year abroad in Hungary, has to remind everyone why Elliot's parents left that country, you finally feel a counterweight to the play's constant whinging about youth and beauty.","Her father's in love with a 20-year-old boy toy.

Style,"In Sequins or Mufti, Chita Rivera Makes a Big Entrance",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/31/style/in-sequins-or-mufti-chita-rivera-makes-a-big-entrance.html,"When the speakers on the rooftop of the Strand Hotel in Midtown began to blare a disco version of ""America"" from ""West Side Story,"" Chita Rivera, the original Anita in the 1957 Broadway production, cut loose, splaying her crimson-tipped fingers and breaking into a giddy trot.

An appreciative roar went up from the crowd that turned out the other night at this ""gypsy tea dance"" to celebrate Ms. Rivera's half-century career, all but engulfing her as they cheered.

Her entrance was a killer. But it didn't rival the moment when, as Claire Zachanassian, she first strides on stage in Kander and Ebb's musical adaptation of ""The Visit,"" and delivers the kind of fire-and-ice performance that may well earn her Broadway's ultimate accolade when the Tony Awards are presented on June 7.

Just a sidelong glance from the kohl-eyed Claire, and the opening night audience was on its feet, its applause so boisterous and sustained that Ms. Rivera had to wave it down with a magisterial sweep of her hand.","A night out at the Strand Hotel with the Broadway star, currently nominated for a Tony (her 10th nomination and potentially her third win).",b1f41f93-487b-5091-a417-2b38da2ea613,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/31/fashion/31DAYOUT/31DAYOUT-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=91539c4dbb0d1d3595fb656e1e9650cd5a0e1b1cbbd6abb423d72ecacf8411d0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Chita Rivera at a party at the Strand Hotel in New York.,b1f41f93-487b-5091-a417-2b38da2ea613,N24News/imgs/b1f41f93-487b-5091-a417-2b38da2ea613.jpg,15
Real Estate,"In Brooklyn, Grand Army Plaza Gets an Intervention",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/realestate/streetscapes-grand-army-plaza-brooklyn.html,"In the moments after the Presidential election was called in favor of Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Nov. 7, a jubilant crowd gathered spontaneously in Brooklyn's Grand Army Plaza, whooping and dancing around the Soldiers' and Sailors' Memorial Arch, atop which the bronze allegorical figure of Columbia, representing America, thundered forth in her horse-drawn chariot, flanked by trumpeting figures of winged Victory. For much of its history since its cornerstone was ceremonially laid by Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman in 1889, the arch, a monument to Union veterans of the Civil War, has offered a pretty good measure of which way the wind was blowing in Brooklyn. In 1976, a time of lean municipal budgets and blight, that wind was literal, as Columbia was blown backward out the back of her chariot, ending up hanging precariously off the arch's roof as a ready symbol of the city's malign neglect. Quick cable work by local firefighters kept her from tumbling into the plaza, and the incident led to a major restoration of the arch beginning in the late '70s.

Today, Columbia and her triumphal bronze companions are healthy and well cared for, thanks to a privately funded preservation program begun in 1999. But the arch they stand on has not been so lucky. The roof of the 80-foot granite monument failed at least 10 years ago, and invasive reeds are growing from the shattered roof tiles. In late 2018, mortar fell from around one of the arch's nine-ton keystones and the fire department again raced to the scene, along with the police. Barricades have been in place ever since to protect pedestrians from falling debris.

To address this monumental decay, a top-to-bottom restoration of the arch will be undertaken next year, funded by $6 million from Mayor Bill de Blasio and performed by the Prospect Park Alliance, a private nonprofit group that operates the park, along with Grand Army Plaza, in partnership with the city. The project, the first full restoration of the arch in 40 years, will stabilize and repoint the exterior envelope of the waterlogged monument, replace the roof, repair some of the interior iron staircases, upgrade the dreary exterior lighting and add new lights inside. The alliance will also spend $3 million to replace the uneven paving around Bailey Fountain, in the plaza's center, and restore the planted berms around its periphery. The conservation work is expected to be completed by 2022, after which the arch's interior and roof will be open to the public on special occasions.

""It is devoid of all life and is a stony waste,"" lamented the Parks Commission in 1887. ""It is suggestive of Siberia in winter and Sahara in summer."" The vaunted firm of McKim, Mead & White was retained to reimagine the plaza, and veterans of the Grand Army of the Republic solicited donations for the construction of a commemorative monument. When fund-raising fell short, the state provided $250,000. John Hemingway Duncan, who was also the architect of Grant's Tomb on Manhattan's Riverside Drive, beat out 35 other entrants to win the $1,000 prize for the design of a memorial arch. To create the bronze sculptural groups subsequently added to the arch's crown and to its two pedestals facing the park, the architect Stanford White tapped the Brooklyn-boy-made-good Frederick MacMonnies, who lived in Paris and had studied at the influential Ecole des Beaux-Arts.

For the pedestals, MacMonnies crafted two complementary groups of fighting men known as the Spirit of the Army and the Spirit of the Navy -- dynamic, agitated depictions of the heroism and sorrows of war. For the Army group, the sculptor included a kind of selfie in bronze, as the officer urging on a cluster of soldiers in the scene was said to be MacMonnies himself. The artist sculpted his works for the Brooklyn arch in France, casting them primarily at Parisian foundries. But the Navy group was damaged while being loaded into a steamship, snapping interior braces and deforming the base so that, as MacMonnies put it, ""the men's knees were shoved up into their neckties."" The statuary was repaired at the direction of the sculptor's brother but encountered additional trouble at the Brooklyn Bridge, where the driver delivering it from New York City was stopped for not having a permit for a wide load. In the end, though, ""Navy"" was hoisted onto the eastern pier of Brooklyn's arch in 1901.

Harking back to the Arch of Titus in Rome, Brooklyn's monument blended classical Roman antecedents with French neoclassical adaptations of the form. ""The use of sculptural groups on pedestals attached to the piers"" is borrowed from the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, art historian Elizabeth Macaulay-Lewis wrote in Classical Receptions Journal in 2016, while the triumphal Columbia and her horse-drawn chariot were inspired by ""the large sculptural group atop the Arc du Carrousel,"" also in Paris. The interior of the Brooklyn arch was also designed with some fine classical details, although the structure is in such disrepair that stepping inside today feels distinctly like entering a ruin. The 107-step iron spiral staircases that corkscrew elegantly up the two piers are badly corroded from chronic leaks and high humidity; icicles have even been known to form in winter. The cast-iron newel posts, chipped and rusted, are in the form of Roman-style ""fasces,"" a bundle of rods with a single ax head that was carried as a symbol of authority during triumphal Roman processions. Though some of the ax heads are missing, they will be replaced with new castings made from molds taken from their surviving counterparts. The stairs in the eastern pier will be repaired. Above the arch, an empty 44-foot-long trophy room -- built to house war relics and formerly the home of the Puppet Library -- has rusting beams supporting its vaulted ceiling, while pools of water have collected on its concrete floor. Understanding the structural elements hidden beneath that floor was crucial to determining the necessary scope of restoration work. No original plans of the arch survive, and the drawings from the 1970s restoration left important mysteries of the arch's construction unsolved. Those '70s plans ""would point to these voids and say, 'structure unknown,'"" said Alden Maddry, the Prospect Park Alliance architect overseeing the restoration. ""We wanted to make sure that the structure of the arch was in reasonably good shape so it won't fall down.""

The tension between the enduring and the ephemeral is also brought into high relief by the compromised physical structure of the monument itself. ""It's in a very vulnerable condition right now, and the Parks Department knows more than anyone that bronze and stone are as fragile in their own ways as any tree or any natural material that they are charged with overseeing,"" Ms. Bogart added. ""It's a fragile object, and it's wonderful in my opinion that this work is about to be done so that people can gather there for whatever reason and find meaning in what they're seeing, whatever those meanings may be.""

Science,Trump's Climate Contrarian: Myron Ebell Takes On the E.P.A.,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/science/myron-ebell-trump-epa.html,"The mug-shot posters, pasted on walls and lampposts around Paris by an activist group during the United Nations climate talks last year, were hardly flattering. They depicted , a climate contrarian, as one of seven ""climate criminals"" wanted for ""destroying our future."" But in his customary mild-mannered way, Mr. Ebell, who directs environmental and energy policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian advocacy group in Washington, brushed it off. ""I've gotten used to this over the years,"" he told an interviewer at the talks. ""But I did go out and get my photo taken with my poster, just so I have it as a memento.""

Mr. Ebell, who revels in taking on the scientific consensus on global warming, will be Mr. Trump's lead agent in choosing personnel and setting the direction of the federal agencies that address climate change and environmental policy more broadly. Mr. Ebell, whose organization is financed in part by the coal industry, has been one of the most vocal opponents of the linchpin of that policy, the Clean Power Plan. Developed by the Environmental Protection Agency, the plan is a far-reaching set of regulations that, by seeking to reduce carbon emissions from electricity generation, could result in the closing of many coal-burning power plants, among other effects. Mr. Ebell has said that the plan, which has been tied up in the courts since it was finalized in 2015, is illegal. In the interview in Paris last year, he said he hoped whoever was elected president would ""undo the E.P.A. power plant regs and some of the other regs that are very harmful to our economy."" As the person Mr. Trump has chosen to lead the transition at the E.P.A., Mr. Ebell, 63, will be in a position to begin to do just that.

Mr. Ebell, who did not respond to a request for an interview, grew up on a ranch in Oregon. He got his undergraduate degree at Colorado College and master's at the London School of Economics, where he studied under the conservative political philosopher Michael Oakeshott. He has described himself as ""sort of a contrarian by nature and upbringing,"" and has said he was very strongly influenced by the ""question authority"" ethos of 1960s and '70s counterculture

""I really think that people should be suspicious of authority,"" he told an interviewer last year. ""The more you're told that you have to believe something, the more you should question it."" Mr. Ebell leads the Cooler Heads Coalition, a loose-knit group that says it is ""focused on dispelling the myths of global warming by exposing flawed economic, scientific, and risk analysis."" He has been one of the nation's most visible climate contrarians, known for dispensing memorable sound bites on cable news shows and at events like the annual conferences sponsored by the Heartland Institute, a Chicago-based group that rejects the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change. Mr. Ebell has said that ""a lot of third-, fourth- and fifth-rate scientists have gotten a long ways"" by embracing climate change. He frequently mocks climate leaders like Al Gore, and has called the movement the ""forces of darkness"" because ""they want to turn off the lights all over the world."" No one, it seems, is immune to his criticism. He called Pope Francis's encyclical on climate change, issued in mid-2015, ""scientifically ill informed, economically illiterate, intellectually incoherent and morally obtuse."" ""It is also theologically suspect, and large parts of it are leftist drivel,"" he added. Mr. Ebell cut his teeth in Washington working for Frontiers of Freedom, a research group founded by former Senator Malcolm Wallop, a Wyoming Republican, to advocate for limited government. He also worked for a Republican congressman from Arizona, John Shadegg, on an effort to revamp the Endangered Species Act to make it more respectful of property rights.

In interviews and speeches, Mr. Ebell comes off as amiable and calm. But he is hardly shy about lobbing verbal grenades, sometimes directly at scientists and environmentalists. He clashed with Kevin E. Trenberth, a senior researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, in an appearance on Fox News in 2009 after the unauthorized release of emails from a server at an English university set off a battle over the integrity of leading climate scientists. Mr. Ebell called Dr. Trenberth ""part of a gang"" that had been ""cooking the data"" on climate for years, accusations that Dr. Trenberth strenuously denied. During an August 2015 appearance on C-Span with Jeremy Symons of the Environmental Defense Fund, Mr. Ebell did not deny Mr. Symons' assertion that the Competitive Enterprise Institute receives money from the Murray Energy Corporation, one of the nation's largest coal producers. He countered that his group's total budget, of about $6 million, was far smaller than that of Mr. Symons' group. ""I would like to have more funding,"" Mr. Ebell said, ""so that I could combat the nonsense put out by the environmental movement.""","President-elect Donald J.

Dance,Two Troupes Evoke Endlessness in Words and Movement,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/arts/dance/exploring-time-in-the-american-realness-festival.html,"In an attempt to evoke eternity, three dancers play triangles, chant overlapping phrases and contort themselves into elaborate yoga poses. Later, three other dancers count to 3,000, as they go through ballet steps and banal conversations that strive for Freudian uncanniness. It's another evening at the American Realness Festival, the experimental performance series that closed on Sunday.

Eleanor Bauer is a smart, brave and gifted American who works in Brussels. On Thursday at the Abrons Arts Center in Manhattan, she presented the American premiere of ""Midday and Eternity (the time piece),"" the final work in a trilogy. In its beginning is its end: the playing of triangles by Ms. Bauer, Cecilia Eliceche and Rebecka Stillman. It is they who periodically chant words from sheets of paper arranged like Mobius strips.

They chant different phrases while orbiting one another like celestial bodies, so only fragments are comprehensible. But these fragments clearly deal with time and the ephemerality of performance. The rising and falling pitch of the chanting is entrancing, but Chris Peck's score unsettles with drumming that goes in and out of metered time and seems to come from all sides.

The dancing of the three -- and especially Ms. Bauer -- is wonderfully three-dimensional. It has a through-the-body looseness and segmented precision like that of Trisha Brown or martial arts, combined with a twitchy eccentricity. The dancers move mostly independently, though in their collective slowing and speeding, they occasionally sync up. Long sequences that seem improvisatory are sometimes reversed exactly.","Eleanor Bauer's ""Midday and Eternity"" and Jillian Peña's ""Polly Pocket"" were performed on Thursday at the Abrons Arts Center.",404013a8-dfcc-5213-bbb8-04427b8cb4ef,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/22/arts/22BAUER/22BAUER-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=7a0f2fd978cb0febdfb72b518b24bede872aab12670166d433382d0636030345&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"American Realness Festival  From left, Cecilia Eliceche, Rebecka Stillman and Eleanor Bauer in ""Midday and Eternity,"" at the Abrons Arts Center.",404013a8-dfcc-5213-bbb8-04427b8cb4ef,N24News/imgs/404013a8-dfcc-5213-bbb8-04427b8cb4ef.jpg,6
Sports,"After a Great Escape, Roger Federer Will Face Djokovic",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/sports/tennis/australian-open-federer-djokovic.html,"Roger Federer, after defeating Tennys Sandgren in the Australian Open quarterfinals, said: ""I don't deserve this one, but I'm standing here and I'm obviously very, very happy.""





MELBOURNE, Australia -- Andre Agassi, one of tennis's better players and deeper thinkers, used to say that one of the things he found most maddening and fascinating about the game was that it had no predetermined finish line. ""You can't run out the clock in tennis,"" he said. But a clock certainly seemed to be ticking for 38-year-old Roger Federer on Tuesday in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open. A Swiss icon and a six-time singles champion here, Federer was struggling not only with his timing. He was also struggling with his body and his unseeded opponent, Tennys Sandgren, a sturdy and thoughtful American ranked 100th in the world but playing much better than that in this event. Sandgren's first name, which is of Swedish origin and has nothing to do with the sport he ended up playing for a living, has long been a source of amusement to those in tennis and, more recently, to Federer.

""I've played a lot of tennis in my life, but never against Tennys,"" he said before their match, groaning at his own joke. As the match developed, Sandgren was on the verge of making a last name for himself, too. Federer won the first set, but as can happen at any age on a tennis court, things got complicated. So complicated that Federer would have to save seven match points in the fourth set before finishing off one of his most agonizing and mesmerizing victories: 6-3, 2-6, 2-6, 7-6 (8), 6-3. Federer saved the first three match points serving at 4-5 in the fourth set. He saved the next four in the fourth-set tiebreaker, which he trailed, 3-6.

Spare a thought for Sandgren, who is likely to remember what might have been for the rest of his days. Federer certainly had empathy. ""I feel a bit bad, in a way, because I didn't feel like he did anything really wrong,"" Federer said. ""It's just luck at some point. I've been on the other side as well."" Not long ago, in fact. In last year's Wimbledon final, Federer had two championship points on his own serve against Novak Djokovic before losing in five sets. ""These ones just sting, and they hurt,"" Federer said, all too aware of the internal dialogue that is a part of the pain. The biggest question: If I could play those match points over, would I play them differently? The conventional wisdom is that it is better to live with disappointment than regret: better to try to seize the opportunity rather than hold back and wait for the other man to crack. But it can work (or fail) either way, and Sandgren tried it both ways. He was bold on the first match point, going for an off-balance backhand down the line that struck the net. He was conservative on the fourth, choosing to play it safe off balls he could have attacked before missing another backhand in the net.

But he was back to attacking on his final two match points, rushing the net on the sixth after his serve, only to be trumped by a passing shot combination from Federer. On the seventh and last, he came forward again, but his chipped backhand approach shot on the run failed to clear the net. ""I could have blinked at the wrong time and shanked,"" Federer said. ""That would have been it."" Instead, he is back in the semifinals of the Australian Open, where -- spare a thought for Federer -- he will face Djokovic, a seven-time champion here, on Thursday night. Federer's draw, which looked like a breeze on paper, has instead been a prolonged great escape. He also trailed, 4-8, in the fifth-set tiebreaker against John Millman in the third round before winning the final six points. Djokovic lost his first set of the tournament, against Jan-Lennard Struff, but has yet to drop another. He defeated Milos Raonic, 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 (1), in their quarterfinal on Tuesday night. Djokovic complained about being unable to see well at times under the lights, and changed contact lenses late in the third set. But he was still able to break Raonic's fearsome serve twice and run his record against the Canadian to 10-0. At age 32, he should be fresher than Federer, despite leading Serbia to victory in the new ATP Cup team event before the Australian Open. Federer skipped the event to preserve his energy and family time, arriving early in Melbourne and playing practice matches. But he has blown hot and cold, often struggling with his forehand consistency. Against Sandgren, he said, he began feeling pain in the groin muscle in his left leg in the second set and eventually sought treatment. Federer planned to undergo medical tests on Wednesday, but if he is able to play, Djokovic will deservedly be the solid favorite in their 50th match.

""Wimbledon last year, he had two match points, and he was one shot away from winning,"" Djokovic said. ""It's not like I've been dominating the matchups. I've had success against him in Grand Slams, in particular. But Roger is Roger. You know that he's always going to play on such a high level regardless of that surface. He loves to play these kinds of matches, big rivalries, semis, finals of Grand Slams. I mean he's probably going to confirm that that's probably the biggest reason why he's still competing."" Djokovic watched the end of Federer's duel with Sandgren. ""I hope to get at least one match point in a few days,"" he said. ""It was quite amazing what Roger has done on the court today, and it's not the first time he has done that in his career. That's why he is who he is."" Converting a match point would be even sweeter. Sandgren would love to have experienced it, but he has traveled a long, arduous road to get so close to the finish line at age 28. There have been injuries, doubts and plenty of unglamorous journeys in tennis's minor leagues. Money has been so tight at times that he has had to forgo a coach. After reaching the quarterfinals here for the first time in 2018, he dropped back again in the rankings. How many times must he have watched Federer's matches from afar only to find himself just one point, one shot, away from beating him in Rod Laver Arena?

""You can't give a good player, let alone maybe the best player ever, that many chances to come back,"" Sandgren said. ""They're going to find their game and start playing well. That seemed to me what happened."" There is, as Agassi noted, no running out the clock, which can make tennis so dramatic and so cruel. Sandgren's own coach, Michael Russell, knows it too well. In 2001, Russell had a match point in the fourth round of the French Open against top-seeded Gustavo Kuerten, who ripped a forehand winner on the 26th shot of the rally and went on to win the match. Kuerten drew a heart on the clay and went on to win the title. Russell had to move on, just as his pupil had to move on later Tuesday night. ""What's the rule here folks?"" Sandgren wrote on Twitter. ""A double shot for each match point you didn't convert?""",Federer saved seven match points against Tennys Sandgren in the fourth set of their Australian Open quarterfinal and will now play Novak Djokovic for the 50th time.,a0f55f71-3c1b-5165-ba18-cf3177dacef2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/28/sports/28tennis-federerdjok/28tennis-federerdjok-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=6cc13a86c5ff98b2925d43b89eb44fd6709e14c0a772450c2ab018807c9941a7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Roger Federer, after defeating Tennys Sandgren in the Australian Open quarterfinals, said: ""I don't deserve this one, but I'm standing here and I'm obviously very, very happy.""",a0f55f71-3c1b-5165-ba18-cf3177dacef2,N24News/imgs/a0f55f71-3c1b-5165-ba18-cf3177dacef2.jpg,9
Automobiles,"Electric, but Not Bragging About It",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/automobiles/autoreviews/electric-but-not-bragging-about-it.html,"For the realities of everyday traffic, Mercedes provides a subtler means of delivering momentary passing power: the kickdown. Push your foot about three-quarters of the way through the accelerator pedal's travel and you'll feel a little click as the E mode level of power is increased by a third -- the electrical equivalent of a turbocharger's kick. When I engaged it on Interstate 280, the car zoomed right along with the fastest left-lane traffic.

That's appropriate, as all aspects of the car's handling, steering and braking were benchmarked against gas-powered models in the Mercedes lineup and made ready for the fast lane.

An electric car is a clever application for the kickdown, but the car's regenerative braking is even more ingenious. Steering-wheel paddles are drafted not to shift gears but to control how much the regenerative system, rather than friction brakes, slows the vehicle. I used the paddles to jockey among braking levels, from D (for Drive) to a grabby D- for maximum energy recovery to coasting in D+. By toggling among the levels, I was able to mostly avoid using the brake pedal in busy traffic.

This pedal-paddle game is fun for E.V. loyalists, but Mercedes drivers will probably prefer something more seamless like the car's D-Auto mode. In D-Auto, the car's radar sensors, mostly there for a collision-warning system, are enlisted to automatically set the level of regenerative braking on the fly. The radar locks onto the car ahead, and the precise amount of braking is then dialed in to maximize the amount of energy reclaimed, all the while working something like adaptive cruise control to regulate the car's speed.

These tricks notwithstanding, this is a Mercedes first and an electric car second. In terms of the flow of exterior lines, interior fit and finish, the comfort of its seats and the tastefulness of its cabin, it will feel right at home in a Mercedes showroom.

""A lot of Silicon Valley people don't want to scream, 'Hey, I'm driving an electric car,' "" Mark A. Webster, Mercedes-Benz USA's general manager for e-mobility, said as we spun through Palo Alto. ""They care about the environment, but they don't have to brag about their sustainability consciousness.""

For all the excesses of this high-flying capital of software, not every well-heeled executive wants a big, flashy and fast electric flagship or a small futuristic E.V. When the B-Class electric goes on sale this summer in select states, mostly on the coasts, they will have a new choice.","The 2014 Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive is the company's first battery-electric car, but it is not a spartan green vehicle.

Travel,Touring the New Photo-Friendly White House,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/05/travel/white-house-tours-photography-michelle-obama.html,"WASHINGTON - The White House public tour has officially entered the modern era, where photography and social media posting are permitted, encouraged and, at times, pervasive. Indeed, in this hallowed center of American politics, nearly every visitor walks around with one hand free. The other is clutching a camera or smartphone. Tours, which stretch from the East Wing through the Residence and out the North Portico doors, last roughly an hour, a perfect time allotment if each room didn't take minutes to frame the perfect picture, come up with a clever caption and post the shot to Instagram, Twitter, Facebook or Snapchat.

As I made my way through the East Wing, trying to create a virtual tour on Snapchat, my White House escort (not something that everyone gets; this was a privilege of being from media) reminded me on multiple occasions that time was running short. When I was still in the East Wing, about a third of the way through the tour, I was told I only had 15 minutes left.

I appreciated the guidance, as I wanted to make sure I saw and Snapchatted in every room, but had to make some adjustments. First, there is no video allowed in the White House, only photography, which made my Snapchat story slightly static. Also, as I wanted to see and Snap everything, I often found myself staring at my phone while walking, which caused me to miss both some artwork hanging in hallways and to bump into the occasional fellow tourist. Despite the slightly harried feeling of walking while posting to a social media site, the tour is a freeing experience. It is mostly self guided; guests can take as long or short a time as they like in the different rooms of the White House. If you wanted to squint and try and count each of the 2,700 books in the Library, you could. (I lingered in the Library longer than I probably should have.)

And each room is staffed not with a tour guide, but a Secret Service agent, equipped with facts and stories pertaining to each room. A fun fact from an agent in the Green Room: Parts of the green walls are actually just silk stretched across beams; there are parts that have no wall behind it.

Other parts of the tour elicit outbursts of reverence. When walking by the Cross Hall, which is the long, red-carpeted corridor connecting the East Room and the State Dining room, a tourist near me exclaimed: ""Oh, this is where President Obama walks out! From Bin Laden!"" (Indeed, it is the hallway Mr. Obama has walked down on numerous occasions before making statements from the East Room.) The tour ends with a walk through the North Portico doors, the famed front doors of the White House that open onto Pennsylvania Avenue, a place where it's certainly worth those extra few seconds to stop and realize exactly where you're standing.

If You Go Taking a White House public tour is easy, and free, so long as you plan in advance. Requests must be made through your local representative, up to six months in advance and no less than 21 days in advance.

Style,The Home Designers Who Actually Move In,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/style/home-design-jersey-ice-cream-company-tara-mangini-percy-bright.html,"CANAAN, N.Y. -- Tara Mangini brushed the sawdust off a picnic table, plunked down a package of Good & Plenty and started talking, very fast. She and Percy Bright, her business partner and boyfriend, were on a tight deadline, rehabbing a tiny 1920s cabin here into their own very particular image: a modern farmhouse style that has made them stars on Pinterest and Instagram and that Ms. Mangini describes simply as a collection of ""stuff we think is cool."" As is their habit, they were building and deploying that stuff with carte blanche from the owners to outfit the place right down to its flea-market artwork and vintage hardcover books. Usually, they camp in the houses they renovate, moving from job to job. (Call them nomadic designers.) But this cabin was so small, they were sleeping in an Airbnb. It was early August, and within two weeks the cabin would be transformed. There would be Shaker-style kitchen cabinets made by Mr. Bright. There would be dressers and tables harvested from the Brimfield Antiques Flea Market in Hampden County, Mass., a source as essential to Mr. Bright and Ms. Mangini's work as Georges Bank is to the regional fishing industry. There would be mismatched antique silver-plate utensils in the kitchen drawers, and the beds would be dressed in neutral-color linens from West Elm and Pine Cone Hill.

And there would be napkins and towels and dishes, along with a welcome note written in pencil on a Post-it: ""We hope you love everything in this house as much as we do! Here's to years of memory making. Love, Jersey Ice Cream Co."" With their camera-ready good looks and extreme method, Ms. Mangini, 33, and Mr. Bright, 32, seem to have tumbled out of a hipster reality show: ""The Homeless Home Designers."" Their company name, Jersey Ice Cream Company, is courtesy of an antique embosser they bought at Brimfield on their second or third date. In the last four years, the couple has camped in (or near) eight houses, performing their meticulous D.I.Y. design mostly throughout the Berkshires and the Catskills, but also in Long Island, N.Y., Tennessee and London. Lovingly chronicled by Design Sponge, Remodelista, Lonny and Apartment Therapy, they have become design-blog superstars. As Dr. Rachael Bedard, Client No. 3, said: ""I was following them on Remodelista and I couldn't figure out: Were these people famous and expensive and inaccessible or just weirdos from Philly? Were they humans or some kind of reality show?""

Ms. Mangini, elfin and energetic, was once a nerdy teenager, she said, who was voted most likely to be president by her New Jersey high school classmates. She and Mr. Bright, a lanky classics major who burned out on a Ph.D. track and then discovered a talent for graphic design, met just after the recession, in Philadelphia, where he had grown up. Mr. Bright had been laid off from a job in advertising (and she had quit a job in advertising), and both were struggling, existentially. He was collecting unemployment and fixing up a rowhouse he had bought just before he was fired; Ms. Mangini was waiting tables. Two weeks after an epic (and out of character) first date, that lasted more than 12 hours and involved the World Cup and many whiskey shots, Ms. Mangini said, they decided to drive to Brimfield to shop for his house. ""All our friends were like: 'No, not a road trip! It's going to be over!'"" Ms. Mangini said. ""But the whole week we were like: 'What if we had an Etsy shop? What if we had a store and did our own designs?' By the end of the trip we're like: 'We're doing it. And it's going to be called Jersey Ice Cream Company, because we found this seal.' We're reusing everything else. Why not reuse someone's name?"" Back in Philadelphia, they styled sections of Mr. Bright's house with winsome touches like a row of antique theater seats. They painted a bathroom wall with chalkboard paint and, in place of the real things, drew an ornate mirror, a soap dish with soap and a glass filled with a toothbrush and toothpaste. They sent photographs of these elements to Design Sponge, which posted them almost immediately.

When they moved to a sublet in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, for eight weeks and decorated it with their Etsy wares and flourishes, like a wall hung with pastel-colored ribbons, Design Sponge posted that, too. (With two million daily visitors from all its platforms, the 12-year-old site can be a marketing powerhouse for unknown designers.) It was an accident that led to their first design-camping gig. While racing to move her parked car, Deborah Billinge, now 62, had fallen down the stairs of her Brooklyn apartment and broken her leg. She and her three teenage children had just moved, her husband was in Europe and Ms. Billinge was surrounded by unpacked boxes and hobbling on crutches. She saw Mr. Bright and Ms. Mangini's sublet makeover on Design Sponge and wrote them: ""Maybe you could help me?"" And after they did, winningly, she wondered, ""Maybe you could help me upstate?"" she said recently, recalling the episode. Ms. Billinge and her husband had bought a farmhouse in the Hudson Valley, closing on the place while she was still in the hospital. She had seen the house only twice. ""I sent them to pick up the keys, and they moved in,"" said Ms. Billinge, who is a landscape designer. ""Because I do gardens, I understood that you can accomplish more when the owner isn't around. I gave them free rein. I had no choice, but I'd also seen what they could do. They would leave little notes, 'We've finished this with love.' It was all very, very emotional. And what a joy to not have to make those decisions, like, if you spend $30 more, you can get this faucet."" When the house was finished, after five months of live-in work, it featured what would become Jersey Ice Cream Company signatures: smoky plaster walls, reclaimed wood furniture made by Mr. Bright, a farm-style kitchen with an apron sink, and curated objects and dishware.

Except for a plumbing emergency, a new door frame and a botched floor refinishing (which they ended up fixing), the couple did all the work themselves. It is an exquisite renovation. ""It's a D.I.Y. ethos with impeccably modern taste,"" said Grace Bonney, the founder of Design Sponge. A word about money. Ms. Billinge had a budget of $45,000, out of which the couple paid themselves a scant few thousand dollars each, even though the job took the better part of five months. They have since learned to charge for their time and materials, as other designers do. In late 2013, Dr. Bedard, a geriatric and palliative-care doctor in Manhattan, and Gideon Friedman, 33, a real estate developer, bought a 220-year-old farmhouse in Earlton, N.Y. ""We wanted to do something fantastic,"" said Dr. Bedard, 34. Since college, the couple had a fantasy about a communal living space for family and friends they called the Magic Egg. In Earlton, they had found their egg. ""Tara and Percy came over for lunch,"" Dr. Bedard said. ""We made macaroni and cheese, and we just really liked them. At that point, they were still basically homeless, and they moved in upstate and lived there on and off from January to June. It was totally nuts: They moved walls, knocked out closets, laid in floors, built beds.""

Finding a place to sleep between jobs has been stressful. For the last five years, Ms. Mangini and Mr. Bright have been living out of suitcases, juggling three storage spaces in two states, and shuffling clothes, antiques and objects. ""We had a kind of breakdown,"" said Mr. Bright, and in June rented a one-bedroom apartment in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. It's now filled with 20 chairs, more or less, a mattress and not much else. By late September, the two had spent less than two weeks there, and not at the same time. That same month, Devin Friedman, 44, the editorial director of GQ (and no relation to Gideon Friedman), and Danielle Pergament, 42, the executive editor of Allure magazine, booked Ms. Mangini and Mr. Bright to build a new kitchen for their late 18th-century farmhouse in the Berkshires. ""They are so funny and so brash,"" Mr. Friedman said. ""And their aesthetic is so great: If you were cool, you would have this stuff in your house."" But just as they were about to start, Mr. Bright came down with a nasty respiratory infection. ""Percy can barely walk, he's laying on the table,"" Ms. Mangini recalled, ""and I'm like, 'It's cool. We got this.' Percy's like, 'I have to go to a hospital.' And, fun fact: I don't drive."" Mr. Bright recovered, the couple made a Brimfield run in July, and by early August they had finished Mr. Friedman and Ms. Pergament's kitchen (Mr. Friedman was particularly impressed with the accessories: succulents in weathered clay pots) and were knee-deep in the Canaan cabin. They had more help than usual: Amber Jane Eaton, 24, who had become a fan from following them on Instagram, drove from Crane, Tex., to work free.

Ms. Mangini and Mr. Bright are pining a bit, they said, for their leaner days. In a few weeks, they will return to a complicated job in the Hamptons, after having spent late August and all of September working on a lovely shingled house in Rockport, Me. In Long Island, an architect is involved, along with a landscape architect, a lighting designer and the owners themselves. ""It's made us appreciate how we normally work,"" Ms. Mangini said. ""It's so weird having clients have the final say in everything."" The job has also made them realize, she said emphatically, that they do not want to become a traditional design practice or morph into a larger company. A few months ago, when they were in Philadelphia working on the new studio apartment Mr. Bright had bought to run as an Airbnb, they posted this rather mournful Instagram update: ""Back to basics today and it feels so good.

Automobiles,Another Family Sedan That Is Firing on Fewer Cylinders,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/17/automobiles/autoreviews/17BUICK.html,"The second-generation LaCrosse, which is almost 7 inches longer than the Regal, made its debut last year to considerable praise, joining the Enclave crossover in broadening Buick's appeal beyond the older customers who had been its loyalists. The average buyer's age is now 65, Buick says, down from 67 three years ago.

Through its recent corporate grief, G.M. has been making some appealing cars, and the LaCrosse is among them.

But the story on this version, the CX, is the addition of the Ecotec engine, the first 4-cylinder in a Buick since the 1998 Skylark. I spent a week with the front-drive CX, which I took on a family vacation to Virginia. In the 400-mile trip from Connecticut, I averaged 27 miles per gallon in mostly highway driving with four people and a dog aboard.

In most driving conditions, the engine response was adequate. There was enough power for highway merges, but not enough to misbehave. I found myself waiting for the coast to be completely clear before changing lanes, forcing me to be a good citizen. Fully loaded, the CX also struggled up hills, teaching me patience. This car is so Zen.

The 4-cylinder is standard in the base CX, as is the suedelike material on the seats. My test car also didn't have a satellite navigation system, leading to my only major annoyance.

The closest power outlet to the dash was in the center console near my elbow. The power cord of my portable GPS unit had to be stretched taut like a clothesline, handy for drying damp clothes perhaps, but deadly when the cord's tension sent the unit flying off the windshield.

Given its solid effort with the LaCrosse, it's hard not to feel that Buick, which once produced cars people still sigh over, might actually be able to compete with foreign brands. But while this 4 is nice, Buick will need small engines that can do much better than 30 m.p.g. Hyundai, for example, now offers a turbocharged 4 in its Sonata that is rated at 33 m.p.g. on the highway while producing an impressive 274 horsepower.

Buick has a new turbo 4 for the 2011 Regal, but it makes about 50 less horsepower than the Sonata's engine while getting only 29 m.p.g. on the highway. And that engine isn't destined for the LaCrosse anyhow.","Powered by G.M.'s Ecotec engine, the second-generation LaCrosse includes the first 4-cylinder in a Buick in a dozen years.",98d06c98-c484-51d8-86ce-a6a2b4792cbd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/10/17/automobiles/BLOC/BLOC-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=229&w=600&s=50087e4686045fb574fc6350139f45da298f36180949cfe693fa949c144a1355&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"FEWER PISTONS The LaCrosse CX comes with a 2.4-liter engine, the first 4-cylinder in a Buick since the 1998 Skylark.",98d06c98-c484-51d8-86ce-a6a2b4792cbd,N24News/imgs/98d06c98-c484-51d8-86ce-a6a2b4792cbd.jpg,23
Fashion & Style,Zippy Amtrak Train Gets Tangled in 'the Swamp',https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/fashion/mens-style/acela-amtrak-train.html,"Sebastian Gorka's voice rippled with contempt as he announced, on behalf of Donald J. Trump, that the old Washington establishment was obsolete. Declaring it was time for ""new ideas,"" Mr. Gorka, then a White House aide, packed disdain into a cryptic phrase that could have been borrowed from science fiction -- a space-age update on the Bolsheviks' ""dustbin of history."" ""We're not going to stay in the Washington bubble,"" Mr. Gorka proclaimed on television, ""or the Acela corridor of wonkery."" With its Asimovian name, wielded these days as a vaguely derisive epithet, the Acela might sound to an untrained ear like something exotic, even menacing. The reality is far more pedestrian: The Acela is a train. In the most literal sense, it is Amtrak's version of luxury rail, traversing a line between Boston and Washington. The Amtrak website boasts of ""speeds up to 150 mph,"" a figure worth boasting about in a region plagued by dysfunctional railways, though sluggish compared with its European and Asian cousins.

At the moment, the train is famous less for moving passengers than for sorting them into a cultural set. Not since the Concorde's last flight in 2003 has a means of transportation given the language such an evocative code word for a way of life -- the flitting between cities of Northeastern elites, whose values and habits are said to have been repudiated in the last election. Sinister cabal or not, the Acela people are an orderly bunch: They march on board in single file, a loose column of pressed shirts and tightly packed totes, rolling luggage and newspapers folded under their arms. When they disembark, they are slightly rumpled, perhaps more than slightly late, agitated by splenetic tweeting and an excess of Dunkin' Donuts coffee that sells for $3.50 in the cafe car. Lizzie O'Leary, the New York-based host of the public radio show ""Marketplace Weekend"" and a frequent Acela rider, shrugs off all the recent train-shaming. Ms. O'Leary, who relies on the Acela to visit her family in Washington, has become an Emily Post-like figure in the Amtrak community. She has a voluble Twitter account that deals extensively with the etiquette of the quiet car, a supposedly placid zone adjacent to the first-class compartment, where cellphone conversations are banned. ""I love the Acela,"" she said. ""I live for the three hours of peace where I can just read or do work.""

Ms. O'Leary noted the difference between the seasoned riders who navigate the train by instinct -- they have a favorite car and snack, often the $6 cheese plate -- and the wide-eyed new arrivals. Scattered throughout the cars, she said, are the ""performatively important,"" ostentatiously high-powered riders who treat the Acela's two-by-two seats as personal boardrooms. ""You're going to have a lot of jerks, and you're going to have a lot of people who think their time is extremely valuable,"" Ms. O'Leary said. ""That's why I sit in the quiet car.""

The physical experience of traveling by Acela is nothing special: The train lurches and sways, making the walk to the cafe car or restroom an acrobatic exercise. It is not necessarily markedly cheaper than air travel -- a ticket from New York to Washington ranges from $165 to $289, one way (first-class costs up to $421)-- but the Acela offers more generous legroom, and the Wi-Fi, at least, comes free. Adherents insist the trip, which lasts just under three hours, is competitive with air travel, factoring in delays on the Van Wyck Expressway and on the tarmac. The relative conveniences are such that when President Trump's health secretary, Tom Price, was found by Politico to have taken an exceptionally costly private flight from Washington to Philadelphia, a puzzled cry went up: Why not take the Acela?

""This is why people argue about the quiet car!"" John Berman, a CNN anchor, said on air last week. ""It's because that train exists. You don't need to take a private jet."" (Mr. Price resigned on Friday, after his penchant for chartered air travel became public.) For some imaginative passengers, the halting motion of a train evokes a certain time and lifestyle, when Eastern aristocrats shuttled between cities without a hint of bashfulness or self-deprecation, simply because it was the finest way to travel. ""When I'm on it, I think of all the political intrigue that's transpired, all the corporate deals that have been brokered and even the occasional cultural masterpiece that's been conceived over the same lines,"" said Keith MacLeod, a lawyer in Boston who often rides the Acela. Mr. MacLeod invoked Teddy Roosevelt and Joseph P. Kennedy riding between Boston and New York, ""and, my favorite of all, George Gershwin writing 'Rhapsody in Blue' on his way to a premiere in Boston, and being inspired by the rhythm of the train."" What passes for railway intrigue now is less romantic: In 2013, a liberal activist caused a stir by live tweeting an indiscreet telephone conversation between Michael Hayden, the former C.I.A. director, and a reporter. In 2007 Arianna Huffington wrote of having eavesdropped on Bill Kristol, the conservative columnist, as he enthused about the White House's messaging on the Iraq war. Mr. Kristol, no friend of the current White House, remains an Acela loyalist, and he has embraced the ""Acela corridor"" designation along with unfashionable labels like ""establishment"" and ""globalist.""",What's the latest code word for the elite values and lifestyle repudiated by the president?

Media,Trump's Attacks on the Press: Telling Escalation From Empty Threats,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/business/media/trump-news-media-attacks.html,"President Trump usually ignores the criticism that comes his way from MSNBC, the reliably liberal cable channel that, his advisers argue, will attack his administration no matter what. But two reports by the channel's parent network, NBC News -- including a scoop that the president sought to expand the nation's nuclear arsenal -- set off some of Mr. Trump's most hostile rhetoric yet about the freedom of the press. ""Network news has become so partisan, distorted and fake that licenses must be challenged and, if appropriate, revoked,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Not fair to public!""

A few caveats to keep in mind. Rage against the media is political Wagyu for the president's base. And Mr. Trump's notion of suspending licenses -- along with his proposal, tweeted last week, that late-night comedians be subject to the ""equal time"" rule -- is essentially unworkable, given how government regulation of the airwaves actually works.

""One has to suppose that he's looking for ways to shock people,"" Russell Baker, the gimlet-eyed longtime observer of Washington, said in a rare interview on Thursday. He seemed not so worked up about this most recent fusillade against the press. ""It may go through, or he might probably forget about it,"" said Mr. Baker, 92, a former columnist for The Times. ""Is anybody shocked anymore? He's used it up. It can only last so long.""

Mr. Trump seems to think like a television producer, a trait recently criticized by Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee. And as the makers of political thrillers like ""House of Cards"" and ""Scandal"" know all too well, television must ratchet up the stakes lest viewers lose interest.
* Jeff Bezos gives $100 million to the Obama Foundation.
* Stocks rise after President Biden says Jerome Powell will stay atop the Fed. The president has already called the news media ""the enemy of the American people,"" and his tweets about ""fake news,"" once a reliable prompter of fury, increasingly feel like a part of Washington's white noise. ""What else could he say that he hasn't already said?"" Bob Schieffer, the broadcasting eminence who formerly anchored ""CBS Evening News"" and hosted ""Face the Nation,"" said in an interview on Thursday. Seen-it-all veterans may take Mr. Trump's recent statements with a few grains of salt. But two former White House officials turned pundits, David Axelrod and Robert Reich, warned of creeping autocracy. And advocacy groups like the Committee to Protect Journalists were moved to point out that such words, issued from the presidential pulpit, can embolden dictators who are more empowered than Mr. Trump to shape or censor coverage. In an instance of irony that Mr. Baker might appreciate, Mr. Trump's State Department issued a pro-media statement -- around the time that the president was jabbing NBC -- that condemned Turkish authorities who had sentenced a Wall Street Journal reporter to prison.

Mr. Schieffer, 80, whose book, ""Overload: Finding Truth in the Deluge of News,"" was released this month, said the news media was playing a crucial civic role. ""This is our assignment from the founders,"" he said. ""Check out what the politicians are saying. Give people information on whether it's true or false."" It stands to reason that Mr. Trump's latest rhetorical thrusts -- amplified by the megaphone of Twitter and 24-hour cable coverage -- have had at least an ambient affect on Americans' trust in the press. The divide between Republicans' and Democrats' perception of the news media is growing. Still, a poll by Reuters this month found that trust in the news media has ticked upward. Nearly half of Americans surveyed said they had ""some"" or a ""great deal"" of confidence in the press, up from 39 percent last November. In that same period, trust in Mr. Trump slipped. The president often uses shocking statements to steer the focus of coverage. On Wednesday, amid a stalled legislative agenda and reports of West Wing turmoil, he told reporters in the Oval Office: ""It's frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write, and people should look into it."" Those words chilled Mr. Schieffer. ""We have to take that very seriously,"" he said. Mr. Trump may be threatening a crackdown, but his team's courtship of the news media goes on. On Thursday, the White House press office emailed reporters an invitation for a traditional Halloween party. ""Trick-or-treating will take place on Friday, October 27,"" the note read. ""All White House press corps are invited to bring their children to the event.""",Old hands like Bob Schieffer and Russell Baker take the president's words with a grain of salt.

Health,Can You Become Immune to the Coronavirus?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/health/coronavirus-immunity-antibodies.html,"As the number of people infected with the coronavirus surpasses 450,000 worldwide, and more than one billion are locked in their homes, scientists are wrestling with one of the most pressing questions of the pandemic: Do people who survive the infection become immune to the virus? The answer is a qualified yes, with some significant unknowns. That's important for several reasons. People who are confirmed to be immune could venture from their homes and help shore up the work force until a vaccine becomes available, for example. In particular, health care workers who are known to be immune could continue to care for the severely ill. Growing immunity in the community also is the way the epidemic ends: With fewer and fewer people to infect, the coronavirus will lose its toehold and even the most vulnerable citizens become more insulated from the threat.

Immunity may also bring an early treatment. Antibodies gathered from the bodies of those who have recovered may be used to aid those struggling with the illness caused by the coronavirus, called Covid-19. On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of plasma from recovered patients to treat some severe cases. A day earlier, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced that New York would become the first state to begin testing serum from people who have recovered from Covid-19 to treat those who are seriously ill. ""It's a trial for people who are in serious condition, but the New York State Department of Health has been working on this with some of New York's best health care agencies, and we think it shows promise,"" Mr. Cuomo said.

Days into an infection, the immune system refines this antibody into a second type, called immunoglobulin G, exquisitely designed to recognize and neutralize a specific virus. The refinement may take as long as a week; both the process and the potency of the final antibodies can vary. Some people make powerful neutralizing antibodies to an infection, while others mount a milder response. The antibodies generated in response to infection with some viruses -- polio or measles, for example -- bestow a lifetime of immunity. But antibodies to the coronaviruses that cause the common cold persist for just one to three years -- and that may be true of their new cousin as well. A study in macaques infected with the new coronavirus suggested that once infected, the monkeys produce neutralizing antibodies and resist further infection. But it is unclear how long the monkeys, or people infected with the virus, will remain immune. Most people who became infected during the SARS epidemic -- that virus is a close cousin of the new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 -- had long-term immunity lasting eight to 10 years, said Vineet D. Menachery, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. Those who recovered from MERS, another coronavirus, saw much shorter-term protection, Dr. Menachery said. People who have been infected with the new coronavirus may have immunity lasting at least one to two years, he added: ""Beyond that, we can't predict."" Still, even if antibody protection were short-lasting and people became reinfected, the second bout with the coronavirus would likely be much milder than the first, said Florian Krammer, a microbiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.

Even after the body stops producing neutralizing antibodies, a subset of immune memory cells can reactivate a response effectively, he noted.
* Virginia's new lieutenant governor-elect says she won't force vaccines. ""You probably would make a good immune response before you even become symptomatic again and might really blunt the course of the disease,"" Dr. Krammer said. A crucial question is whether children and adults who have only mild symptoms still generate a strong enough response to remain immune to the virus until a vaccine is available. Dr. Marion Koopmans, a virologist at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, and her team have screened antibody responses in 15 infected patients and health care workers. The researchers are also using banked blood samples from about 100 people who were known to be infected with one of four coronaviruses known to cause the common cold. If those samples show some immune response to the new coronavirus, too, Dr. Koopmans said, it might explain why some people -- children, for example -- have only mild symptoms. They may have antibodies to related coronaviruses that are at least somewhat effective against the new one. The quickest way to assess immunity is a blood test that looks for protective antibodies in the blood of people who have recovered. But first you have to have the test.

Antibody tests are used in Singapore, China and a handful of other countries. But they are just coming to market in much of the West. Last week, Dr. Krammer and his colleagues developed one such antibody test that could be scaled up in ""days to weeks,"" he said. The team validated the test in blood plasma taken from three patients with Covid-19. The researchers are seeking speedy approval from the F.D.A. Dozens of other labs are also at work on a dizzying list of tests, although they, too, are mostly based on slim data that has not yet been reviewed by other scientists. ""No matter who makes them, as long as they're reliable, that's a super nice tool,"" Dr. Krammer said. Because this is a new coronavirus, the test should deliver ""basically, a yes or no answer, like an H.I.V. test -- you can figure out who was exposed and who wasn't."" On Wednesday, officials of Public Health England said they had purchased millions of newly developed antibody tests and were evaluating them for patients to use at home. Citizens who discovered they had been exposed and now had some immunity to the coronavirus might be able to return to normal lives, the officials said. That would be particularly useful for health care workers. Those who know they have at least some immunity could be placed on the front lines of emergency care, sparing colleagues who have not been exposed.

[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] ""If this really goes on for months at a time, for 18 months as some people have projected, having health care workers who are immune to the virus will be really, really helpful,"" said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York. But tests like these may not be of much use for diagnosis of coronavirus infection as it gets underway, because of the time it takes for the body to begin producing antibodies. Dr. Krammer's test picks up an antibody response as early as three days after symptoms emerge. Given that people may not show symptoms for as long as 14 days after infection, however, that is too late for the test to be useful as a diagnostic tool. Finding people with powerful antibody responses might help point the way to new treatments, however. Essentially, antibodies extracted from the blood of recovered patients are injected into those who are ill. Several teams have already been working on such an effort, following early reports from China of success. A Beijing-based company called AnyGo Technology has provided 50,000 tests to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and to hospitals in Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai, according to its founder, Dr. Le Sun. Dr. Shangen Zheng, a doctor with the Chinese military, said his team had treated more than 10 patients so far, and data from many more patients treated with plasma in Hubei Province is being assessed. This approach is actually ""something very old-fashioned,"" Dr. Krammer said. It was used to save American soldiers infected with the hemorrhagic Hantaan virus during the Korean War, and to treat people in Argentina infected with the hemorrhagic Junin virus.

Before the method can be put into wide use, however, scientists must work out safety issues, such as ensuring that the plasma taken from recovered patients is free of other viruses and toxins. Pharmaceutical companies like Takeda and Regeneron are hoping to sidestep some of those questions by developing antibodies against the coronavirus in the laboratory. Ultimately, it is only with these tests that scientists will be able to say when enough of the population has been infected and has become immune -- and when the virus has begun to run out of hosts.","It's likely you can, at least for some period of time. That is opening new opportunities for testing and treatment.",c242c167-5f9b-5a80-8b17-9116f876abe4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/25/science/25VIRUS-ANTIBODIES1/25VIRUS-ANTIBODIES1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a32280836b19b78d2539d280c7fd30eaeee90673d9d9671f88e7602b9e39b01f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A recovered coronavirus patient donated plasma at the Hainan Blood Center in Haikou, China, in February.",c242c167-5f9b-5a80-8b17-9116f876abe4,N24News/imgs/c242c167-5f9b-5a80-8b17-9116f876abe4.jpg,1
Sports,The Orioles Looked Done. Now They're Threatening the Yankees' Playoff Plans.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/11/sports/baseball/orioles-yankees-playoffs.html,"The Orioles' outfielders -- from left, Ryan Mountcastle, Mason Williams and D.J. Stewart -- after their win over the Yankees on Sunday.





When the Miami Marlins needed pitching help after their coronavirus outbreak this summer, they turned to the Baltimore Orioles. A few weeks later, when the Atlanta Braves wanted a starter, they also made a deal with the Orioles. The Mets and the Colorado Rockies got relievers from Baltimore, too. Trading veterans for prospects is standard for rebuilding teams. Yet when the Orioles arrived at Yankee Stadium for a doubleheader on Tuesday, they knew they could leave in position for a playoff spot with a sweep. It did not happen; the Yankees asserted themselves with a 6-0 shutout by Gerrit Cole and then a 10-1 blowout in the second game. The Orioles, who took three of four from the Yankees in Baltimore last weekend, now stand 20-24, while the Yankees improved to 24-21, still good for the No. 8 seed in an expanded playoff field. The lowly did not overtake the lordly. But even with some former teammates now scattered across the majors, the Orioles still have a chance as the short season enters its final stretch.

""It was sad to see those guys leave; they were a big part of our team,"" said Pat Valaika, who has played six positions for the Orioles this season. ""But our attitude was that's just another opportunity for somebody to fill that role -- and we have a lot of talented players. That's what gets not really talked about that much: our team is talented. We have a few veteran guys, but we're young and I think a lot of people underestimated us, and that's kind of fun.""

The Orioles did not trade star players -- their deals included Richard Bleier to Miami, Tommy Milone to Atlanta, Mychal Givens to Colorado and Miguel Castro to the Mets -- but, then, they did not really have stars, anyway. They lost 115 games in 2018 and 108 last year, with Mike Elias taking over for Dan Duquette as general manager in between. Elias, a former pitcher for Yale and scout for the St. Louis Cardinals, has been in this spot before. After the 2011 season, he was named scouting director for the Houston Astros, who were then the majors' worst team. Under General Manager Jeff Luhnow, the Astros slashed payroll, compiled a lot of losses and a lot of high draft picks, and soon became a power. An overlooked part of their rise -- which has been marred by a sign-stealing scheme that cost Luhnow, and others, their jobs -- may be playing out again in Baltimore. While the Astros were considered to have a barren farm system a decade ago, their new front office did inherit Jose Altuve, Dallas Keuchel and George Springer -- a future Most Valuable Player, Cy Young Award winner and World Series M.V.P. This summer, the Orioles are showing Elias that they, too, could have more long-term answers than many people realized.

""I thought the farm system was underrated, and the perception of it was hurt a little bit by the lack of an international component,"" Elias said, adding that a more modern approach to player development had helped the existing prospects. ""It turned out that we absolutely inherited a lot of good talent that was drafted and acquired in trade by Dan Duquette and the people here beforehand. That is a huge boon for us."" Elias added: ""Our goal -- especially the type of franchise we are and division we're in -- is that we're one of these teams, we hope, like Cleveland or the Rays, that can just kind of keep the assembly line moving.""

Part of the reason for the recent trades, Elias said, was to give opportunities to the products of that assembly line. The rookies Dean Kremer and Keegan Akin have joined the rotation in the last two weeks, and the former first-round draft picks Hunter Harvey and Dillon Tate -- traded from the Yankees for Zack Britton in 2018 -- are getting longer looks in the bullpen. Outfielders Ryan Mountcastle and D.J. Stewart, also former first-round picks, had helped the offense average 4.98 runs per game through Wednesday, trailing only the Chicago White Sox and the Astros in the A.L. ""There's not really any weak spot in our lineup,"" Valaika said. ""People have different skill sets; there's some power guys, some guys with speed. We're not one-dimensional, just waiting for the long ball. We can manufacture runs pretty well.""

Art & Design,What Leonardo da Vinci Couldn't Finish,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/arts/design/davinci-saint-jerome-metropolitan-museum.html,"The 500th anniversary of the death of Leonardo da Vinci will bring big doings to Paris this fall with the largest-ever and one-stop-only career survey at the Louvre. And New York gets a shot of buzz in advance with the opening at the Met on July 15 of a single-painting show of one of the most rawly emotional image s in the Leonardo canon. Leonardo was a star from the start. According to the 16th-century art historian Giorgio Vasari, his contemporaries found him terrifically attractive. (Vasari calls him ""divine"" a dozen times in a 20-page Leonardo biography.) Genial, gorgeous, brainy and a fashion plate (partial to pink), he had the poise of a prince and a philosopher's ruminative mind. In his long career as artist, architect, scientist and inventor, grace and talent combined to smooth his path from rural Tuscany, where he was born in 1452, to the courts of Milan and papal Rome, to France where, as pet artist to Francis I, he died in 1 519. But that ruminative cast of mind caused problems. Basically, before Leonardo did anything he had to know everything: how his paints and varnishes were made, how the human body was internally structured, and what creating art might mean in the cosmic scheme of things.

The painting at the Met, ""Saint Jerome Praying in the Wilderness,"" on loan from the Vatican Museums, is one of those unfinished pictures. It was likely begun around 1483, and you see instantly that it's a work in progress: fined-tuned here, slapped down there. Incompleteness is part of its power. And powerful this picture is, as dramatically rich as a three-act opera, with a full-throttle aria of scorching anguish at its center. Equally important, its ""non finito"" state is formally instructive. It lets us see Leonardo's distracted, stop-and-start painting method in action. The picture is one of a dozen or so works widely accepted as being, without question, from his hand. It depicts an early Christian saint who, after a self-punishing stint as a desert ascetic, settled for years in Rome where he turned his attention to translating the Bible from Hebrew and Greek into Latin. Many Renaissance paintings of Jerome (347-420 A.D.) show him immersed in this scholarly labor, usually accompanied by a snoozing lion, a kind of emotional support companion. The mood of such pictures tends to have a cozy Peaceable Kingdom vibe. Leonardo's painting does not. Here saint and beast alike are untamed. This is the Jerome of desert wildness, or maybe the one who ended up dying far from Rome in a rock-hewn cave near Bethlehem. Aged, nearly toothless, and sun-scorched, he holds a stone in his extended right hand, as if about to deliver a penitential blow to his chest. At his feet is the lion, sleek, alert, tail curled like a scimitar, mouth opened wide in a growl.

We know nothing about why, or for whom, the picture was made. Carmen C. Bambach, the Met curator who organized the exhibition, proposes that it was started soon after the artist relocated from Florence to Milan. Although it reflects Leonardo's Florentine style -- and there's a tiny sketch of what could be a Tuscan church in the upper right corner -- it's painted on a panel of walnut, a wood commonly used as a support in Milan, but very rarely in Florence. Conservators have found evidence that Leonardo left off work at an early point and picked it up again, possibly more than once, later. Standing in front of the picture, which hangs, spotlighted, in a darkened gallery in the Met's Lehman wing, you can get a sense of restless layers of activity. In some areas it never progressed beyond a preliminary stage. The lion, a tawny silhouette with washy internal detailing, is a compositional place marker. The same is true of Jerome's unmodeled rock-holding arm. But beginning just below the shoulder, this changes. Flesh suddenly gains shading; musculature develops. This naturalism spreads to the face, a construction of sinew and bone that brings Leonardo's autopsy drawings to mind. Even within this clinical precision, though, certain features are hard to read. At a glance, the saint's eyes seem to be sightless or downcast. In fact, they are directed upward to a fleetly sketched, apparitional image of a crucifix seen in profile.

And, enchantingly, just behind the saint, a misted landscape appears, bringing the refreshment of color -- sky-blue, tree-green -- to a penumbral scene. In the exacting depiction of Jerome's face and torso we see the hand and eye of Leonardo the anatomist. In the landscape, we see the naturalist, the botanist, the weather-watcher, the world lover. It may say something about this love that we find traces of the artist's fingerprints in the landscape passage where he dabbed and smooshed paint by hand to create a soft-focus atmosphere.

Still, the painting's real focus is Jerome's agonized face. And its real subject, to my eye, is inflamed spiritual grief. What we know is that Leonardo kept the picture with him till he died, then another history took over. The work drops from the record until the late 18th or early 19th century when the Swiss painter Angelica Kaufmann (1741-1839), then living in Rome, acquired it. At some point, pieces were cut from the panel -- probably with the idea of selling the more finished sections -- and later reassembled. At the Met, thanks to raked lighting, you can see repair lines around the saint's head. Why Leonardo left this and other pictures unfinished, we can't know. Ms. Bambach, who organized the Met's 2003 Leonardo drawing survey and whose awesomely ambitious four-volume study of the artist called ""Leonardo da Vinci Rediscovered,"" will appear later this month, suggests that the answer may lie in his relentlessly inquisitive personality: in a now-familiar internet way, every search for information he made turned up links to other searches, which he couldn't resist pursuing. And in this she's in agreement with the forgiving Vasari, who wrote: ""Leonardo's profound and discerning mind was so ambitious that this was itself an impediment; and the reason he failed was because he endeavored to add excellence and perfection to perfection. As our Petrarch has said, the desire outran the performance.""","""Saint Jerome Praying in the Wilderness"" at the Met Museum is a masterpiece in progress from a perfectionist who hated to say ""done.""",aea62177-c011-527e-8ac0-97c9b842481d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/12/arts/12DaVinci-Review/12DaVinci-Review-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=359a5902b16cfcea57b67ce9650ad68e1ac62476c7cb2f6a01d76fc83dd2e365&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A detail of Leonardo da Vinci's ""Saint Jerome Praying in the Wilderness"" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Health,Fever Checks Are No Safeguard Against Covid-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/13/health/covid-fever-checks-dining.html,"In recent weeks, a new cadre of gatekeepers armed with thermometer guns has appeared at the entrances of hospitals, office buildings and manufacturing plants to screen out feverish individuals who may carry the coronavirus. Employees at some companies must report their temperature on apps to get clearance to come in. And when indoor dining resumes at restaurants in New York City later this month, temperature checks will be done at the door. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the practice of checking for fever has become more and more commonplace, causing a surge in sales of infrared contact-free thermometers and body temperature scanners even as the scientific evidence indicating they are of little value has solidified. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York last week called for checking patrons' temperatures as one of several ground rules for resuming indoor dining in restaurants, along with strict limits on the number of tables and a mask mandate for diners when they are not seated. Restaurants also will be required to obtain contact information from one guest at each table.

There is ample reason for concern. Coronavirus outbreaks -- like one in East Lansing, Mich., this summer that infected 187 people -- have been traced to superspreading gatherings at bars and restaurants. And a new study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that one difference between people who contracted the virus and those who did not is that infected individuals were twice as likely to have eaten at a restaurant in the two weeks preceding their illness. The study, however, did not distinguish between outdoor dining and indoor seating, which most experts consider more hazardous. But while health officials have endorsed masks and social distancing as effective measures for curbing the spread of the coronavirus, some experts scoff at fever checks. Taking temperatures at entry points is nothing more than theater, they say, a gesture that is unlikely to screen out many infected individuals, and one that offers little more than the illusion of safety. Mr. Cuomo has allowed businesses to demand that patrons undergo temperature checks, and to deny admission to those who refuse or have a fever, and he is requiring restaurants in New York City that resume indoor dining to check customers' temperatures. The C.D.C. defines a fever as a temperature of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher; some reports have questioned the accuracy of thermometer guns, however. While temperature checks may identify people who are seriously ill, those are the people who probably won't be socializing much or going out for meals. And a growing body of evidence suggests that many of those who are driving transmission are so-called silent carriers -- people who have been infected but feel fine, and don't have a fever or any other symptoms. Earlier this week, the C.D.C. -- which in May told employers to consider checking workers daily for symptoms like fever, but appeared to reverse itself in July -- said it would stop requiring airport health screenings beginning Sept. 14 for international passengers from China, Iran, Brazil and other countries because the checks can't identify silent carriers.

""We now have a better understanding of Covid-19 transmission that indicates symptom-based screening has limited effectiveness because people with Covid-19 may have no symptoms or fever at the time of screening, or only mild symptoms,"" the C.D.C. said in a statement. Temperature checks are akin to ""getting the oil checked before you go on a long car trip,"" said Dr. David Thomas, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ""It makes you feel better, but it's not going to keep you from wrecking the car or prevent the tires from falling off. It's not going to make your trip any safer."" ""It's something you can do, and it makes you feel like you're doing something,"" he said. ""But it won't catch most people who are spreading Covid."" Most people who spike a fever feel lousy, and presumably would cancel their dinner plans, said Dr. Thomas McGinn, Northwell Health's senior vice president and deputy physician in chief. Temperature checks might pick up a few individuals who are unaware of their fever, he said. But the absence of fever ""means nothing,"" he said. ""It's not a very sensitive test."" It does, however, convey a strong public health message, serving as a reminder that people must take precautions, and that itself may be of benefit, Dr. McGinn said. ""It makes people think twice, and reminds them that this is a big deal, we still need to be careful, you need someone to stand by the door to do that,"" he said. But here's the rub: While fever can be a symptom of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, not everyone infected with the virus develops a fever, or many other symptoms, for that matter. Physicians writing in the New England Journal of Medicine have called the phenomenon of symptomless spread the ""Achilles' heel of Covid-19 pandemic control."" Evidence of asymptomatic spread dates back to early in the pandemic, but has been mounting ever since. A recent study from South Korea published in JAMA Internal Medicine in August offered even more proof, finding that infected individuals who don't feel ill may carry just as much virus in their nose, throat and lungs as those with symptoms -- and for almost as long.

A. David Paltiel, a professor of health policy and management at Yale School of Public Health, says these individuals are the ""silent spreaders"" who are driving transmission and sparking superspreading events. ""You are maximally infectious before you exhibit symptoms, if you exhibit any symptoms at all,"" Dr. Paltiel said. ""You can be exposed and incubating the virus, and be beginning to shed massive amounts of transmissible virus and be a superspreader, without actually exhibiting any symptoms like a fever."" Temperature checks will do nothing to stop these ""ticking time bombs,"" he said. ""It's a bad idea."" Instead, he said, restaurants should push for access to rapid turnaround, point-of-care tests for patrons. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Interestingly, even seriously ill coronavirus patients who need medical attention don't always have a temperature. Of nearly 6,000 patients in the New York area who were so sick last spring that they were admitted to Northwell Health hospitals, only 30 percent were febrile when they came in, according to a study by Dr. McGinn that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The trend is consistent with earlier reports, including a study from China that looked at more than 1,000 patients admitted to 552 hospitals through the end of January. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, reported that only 44 percent of the patients had an elevated temperature when they were admitted, though most (88 percent) developed a fever during the course of their hospital stay. In July, the C.D.C. quietly updated its guidance to businesses, acknowledging that symptom and temperature checks ""will not be completely effective"" because asymptomatic individuals and those with vague symptoms will pass the screenings. But even as the agency warned that ""health checks are not a replacement for other protective measures such as social distancing,"" it provided detailed guidelines for doing temperature checks, advising the use of disposable or non-contact thermometers and saying screeners should change gloves in between checks. The bottom line, officials from the federal health agency said, is that screening employees for Covid-19, including using temperatures checks, before they return to work is ""an optional strategy businesses can consider implementing depending on their local situation.""

Peter Kuhn, a professor of biological science, medicine and engineering at the University of Southern California, said his studies suggested that fever is often a first symptom of the coronavirus. And while temperature checks may be useful, he said they should be used in conjunction with a comprehensive package of safety measures that include requiring masks and social distancing, and ensuring good ventilation and access to a flow of fresh air. ""Temperature checks are one part of that, but they are only one part,"" Dr. Kuhn said. ""If anyone would argue that they can provide complete safety for indoor dining, that is completely wrong. It's not a magic bullet.""","The practice of taking temperatures is becoming de rigueur in many workplaces and restaurants, even though federal health officials say they are of limited value.",81df4a0b-b925-5dae-b109-1004636e796a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/11/science/00VIRUS-TEMPERATURE/00VIRUS-TEMPERATURE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=5fad79ec2211463419513c32a5c810987a6065b8c052df2d187b99b7da32ba1a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Temperature checks are like getting the oil checked before a long car trip, said one expert: ""It makes you feel better,"" but ""it's not going to make your trip any safer.""",81df4a0b-b925-5dae-b109-1004636e796a,N24News/imgs/81df4a0b-b925-5dae-b109-1004636e796a.jpg,1

Science,Parrots Are a Lot More Than 'Pretty Bird',https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/science/parrots-are-a-lot-more-than-pretty-bird.html,"Juan F. Masello never intended to study wild parrots. Twenty years ago, as a graduate student visiting the northernmost province of Patagonia in Argentina, he planned to write his dissertation on colony formation among seabirds. But when he asked around for flocks of, say, cormorants or storm petrels, a park warden told him he was out of luck. ""He said, 'This is the only part of Patagonia with no seabird colonies,'"" recalled Dr. Masello, a principal investigator in animal ecology and systematics at Justus Liebig University in Germany. Might the young scientist be interested in seeing a large colony of parrots instead? The sight that greeted Dr. Masello was ""amazing"" and ""incredible,"" he said. ""It was almost beyond words.""

On a 160-foot-high sandstone cliff that stretched some seven miles along the Atlantic coast, tens of thousands of pairs of burrowing parrots had used their powerful bills to dig holes -- their nests -- deep into the rock face. And when breeding season began not long afterward, the sky around the cliffs erupted into a raucous carnival of parrot: 150,000 crow-size, polychromed aeronauts with olive backsides, turquoise wings, white epaulets and bright red belly patches ringed in gold. Dr. Masello was hooked. Today, Dr. Masello's hands are covered with bite scars. He has had four operations to repair a broken knee, a broken nose -- ""the little accidents you get from working with parrots,"" he said. Still, he has no regrets. Dr. Masello is one of a small but unabashedly enthusiastic circle of researchers who study Psittaciformes, the avian order that includes parrots, parakeets, macaws and cockatoos. For all their visual splash and cartoon familiarity, parrots have long been given scientific short shrift in favor of more amenable subjects like, say, zebra finches or blue tits. But through a mix of rugged and sometimes risky field work, laboratory studies and a willingness to shrug off the frequent loss of expensive tracking equipment, researchers are gaining insights into the lives, minds and startling appetites of parrots.

Parrot partisans say the birds easily rival the great apes and dolphins in all-around braininess and resourcefulness, and may be the only animals apart from humans capable of dancing to the beat. ""We call them feathered primates,"" said Irene Pepperberg, who studies animal cognition at Harvard and is renowned for her research with Alex and other African grey parrots. ""They're very good colleagues,"" said Alice Auersperg of the University of Vienna, who studies the Goffin's cockatoo of Indonesia. Many of the recent discoveries are described in a new book, ""Parrots of the Wild: A Natural History of the World's Most Captivating Birds,"" by Catherine A. Toft and Timothy F. Wright. Others have been reported in journals or demonstrated through online videos, which have gone viral or deserve to. Dr. Auersperg and her colleagues have found that Goffin's cockatoos are among the most spontaneously inventive toolmakers ever described, and that the birds can learn how to fashion the latest food-fetching device after just a single viewing of a master cockatoo at work. Studying the yellow-naped Amazon of Costa Rica, Dr. Wright and his colleagues have discovered that different populations of the parrot communicate with one another in distinct dialects that remain stable over decades, like human languages. Just as with people, young parrots can easily master multiple dialects while their elders can't or won't bother to do likewise.

A recent DNA analysis showed that parrots were closely related to falcons, a finding that dovetails with field studies of parrots' often merciless dietary habits. While falcons are predators in the conventional sense, hunting and devouring other animals, parrots turn out to be no less bloodthirsty in their approach to feasting on plants. Forget about symbiosis or some happy tit-for-tat between flora and this particular fauna. Parrots pooh-pooh the fruit pulp and home in on the seeds, crushing the casings to extract the plant embryos and the cache of fats and proteins intended to help those embryos germinate. ""A parrot is a plant carnivore,"" Dr. Wright said. ""It destroys the seed. It goes right in through the fruit and eats the plant baby."" Or the entire herbaceous brood. Researchers have found that when a flock of parrots alights on a fruiting tree, a veritable seed massacre can ensue. In one study of canary-winged parakeets foraging on the seeds of shaving-brush trees in the Cerrado tropical savanna of central Brazil, scientists determined that the birds destroyed 66 percent to 100 percent of each tree's fruit in a matter of days. Not a single whole seed could be found on the ground. The psittacines are a midsize club of about 360 species, ranging in size from the pygmy parrots of New Guinea, which are smaller than house sparrows, to the bulky, flightless kakapos of New Zealand, which can weigh up to nine pounds. Most parrots live in the tropics or subtropics, where a mix of habitat loss and the depredations of the international pet trade now threaten a third of all species with extinction, Dr. Masello said.

""Monk parakeets from South America are doing nicely in New York City,"" said Leo Joseph, a parrot expert and director of the Australian National Wildlife Collection in Canberra. ""Peach-faced lovebirds from Africa are well-established in Arizona."" Residents of Los Angeles County may spot enclaves of more than a dozen different feral parrots, including lilac-crowned Amazons, rose-ringed parakeets, macaws and cockatiels. Why some parrots thrive in anthropocentric landscapes while others are on the cusp of oblivion has yet to be determined. Researchers propose that many of the parrot's signature traits evolved to meet the challenge of seed predation and exploiting a resource that plants do everything in their power to defend. The parrot's muscular jaw and huge bill -- specially hinged to allow top and bottom to move independently, up and down and from side to side -- can crack open even the toughest and woodiest shells. The curved points of the bill act rather like lobster picks, ideal for scooping out seed meat. Parrots can similarly clip apart leg bands, satellite holsters and other animal-tracking devices, which is one reason most researchers have avoided them. Another demand of granivory, or seed predation, is the power to withstand the many defensive chemicals that plants pack into their genetic hope chests. Researchers have lately gathered evidence that a drive to detoxify could explain why parrots often converge on clay flats and start nibbling at the ground.

In laboratory experiments at the University of California, Davis, scientists fed orange-winged parrots small doses of quinidine, a potentially toxic alkaloid, and followed with what they called a ""chaser"" of Peruvian clay. The researchers found that the clay served a doubly salubrious purpose, first by directly binding to the poison and helping to flush it from the body, and then by stimulating the production of a mucus shield in the gut. Paradoxically, scientists said, the pursuit of toxic prey may be linked to the parrot's exceptional longevity. The difficult diet probably selected for a tough constitution, with top-flight immune and DNA repair systems, and tough things tend to last. In addition, the ingested toxins may well have an antimicrobial, anti-parasitic effect, helping parrots to fend off disease. However they manage, parrots can live a half century or longer: the record-holder among Moluccan cockatoos, for example, is 92, and a very lucky kakapo might make it to 120. Yet seed hunting's greatest evolutionary effect on parrothood may well have been psychosocial, transforming the birds into brainy schmoozers. Fruiting trees are a patchy and unpredictable resource, and parrots often fly many miles a day in quest of food. Under such circumstances, searching in groups turns out to be more efficient than solitary hunting, especially when group members can trade tips on promising leads. ""That can mean the development of a social system, as well as the neurological capacity to share information,"" Dr. Joseph said. The vocal capacity, too: parrots call to one another continually, squawkishly, over long distances and short.

""It's extremely rare to find mimicry of other species in wild parrots,"" he said. He also suggested that the ability of some parrots in captivity to move to a musical beat may be an offshoot of vocal mimicry, a generalized motor pattern geared toward synchrony playing out in body or voice. The most celebrated dancing parrot is Snowball, a sulfur-crested cockatoo with a trademarked name whose YouTube dance performances to Queen, Michael Jackson and the Backstreet Boys have been viewed some 15 million times. Always Trying Something New Researchers are still getting a bead on parrot intelligence, and they are repeatedly surprised by each new display of it. Dr. Pepperberg and her collaborators have shown that African grey parrots have exceptional number skills: Alex could deduce the proper order of numbers up to 8, add three small numbers together and even had a zerolike concept -- ""skills equivalent to those of a four-and-a-half-year-old child,"" Dr. Pepperberg said. Dr. Auersperg and her co-workers have found that Goffin's cockatoos are more geared toward solving technical tasks. Alternately using their bills and feet, the birds can systematically make their way through a lock with five different complex mechanisms on it. Should they discover that one of the steps can be skipped en route to opening a chamber with a nut inside, they skip it the next time around. And in an act of ingenuity that Dr. Auersperg called ""sensational"" for an animal not known to use tools in the wild, a cockatoo named Figaro one day started carefully chipping at the edge of a larch wood frame until he had formed a long, slender pole, which he then wielded in his bill like a hockey stick to knock out pebbles and nuts hidden under boxes. ""It took him 20 minutes to make his first tool,"" Dr. Auersperg said. ""After that, he could do it in less than five minutes.""","Out of the cage, they speak their own language, make tools, and wreak havoc on plants and researchers' efforts alike.",649fc569-da9e-50d7-9362-4327c780e065,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/22/science/22PARROTSJP3/22PARROTSJP3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=7e5069c82be18e15a76e482e4f4f28f667983eafea06179bb3327e54188968c5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A Cuban Amazon parrot.,649fc569-da9e-50d7-9362-4327c780e065,N24News/imgs/649fc569-da9e-50d7-9362-4327c780e065.jpg,2
Movies,Review: Teenage Kicks Go Too Far in 'Flower',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/movies/flower-review-zoey-deutch.html,"Cruelly amoral and only marginally credible, ""Flower"" is nevertheless wildly entertaining and at times even touching. Antic and impulsive, Erica is a smart, damaged bully whose father is in prison and whose mother, Laurie (the great Kathryn Hahn), would rather befriend than parent. The teenager also has a strange fixation on penises, which she gratifies by having close encounters with as many as possible and sketching them in a notebook. It's all very cute, until Laurie's boyfriend and his deeply troubled son (Tim Heidecker and Joey Morgan) move in and the narrative dives off a cliff.

Even so, the fall is propelled by such zippy dialogue and unexpectedly sweet moments (Erica and Laurie's relationship, especially, is warmly believable) that you may not care. The supporting players -- including Adam Scott as a possibly skeevy high school teacher -- are all strong, and the director, Max Winkler (son of Henry), never breaks stride. Making liberal use of dizzying close-ups, he swerves from dark coming-of-age comedy to outright horror, refusing to punish Erica for behavior that grows ever more appalling.",Zoey Deutch gives a magnetic performance as a damaged teenager in this wildly entertaining film.,5a2e4f55-acdb-5d8a-98d7-d86f33df6ec7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/16/movies/16flower1/16flower1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=e4d3a1380a6e4e2b2d7c11c33610e83b6db9ef860390996b2bb79051a62d8c36&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Dylan Gelula, Maya Eshet and Zoey Deutch in ""Flower,"" a cruelly amoral but wildly entertaining movie.",5a2e4f55-acdb-5d8a-98d7-d86f33df6ec7,N24News/imgs/5a2e4f55-acdb-5d8a-98d7-d86f33df6ec7.jpg,5
Food,Paul Theroux's Egg-Tested Nonstick Frying Pan,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/dining/paul-theroux-frying-pan.html,"PUPUKEA, Hawaii -- The first step in making an omelet: ""Catch a chicken,"" advises the novelist and travel writer . Every spring, Mr. Theroux liberates the chickens from his backyard coop on the North Shore of Oahu before decamping to Cape Cod. Every fall, he rounds them up again, luring them with food at the back of a cage and waiting until nightfall, when they roost, to grab them.

Mr. Theroux, 74, keeps only 10 chickens in the coop at a time, for a yield of three to four eggs a day. Some 30 of their fellows amble unfettered around the seven-acre estate, steering clear of the geese, which honk bossily under the house.

As a child in Massachusetts, Mr. Theroux used to feed his grandfather's Rhode Island Reds. Their counterparts here are ""jungle chickens,"" he said. They lay eggs with shells almost the color of champagne and yolks high and fat, perfect domes. Most days, the eggs are destined for an omelet, made in any of a series of nonstick frying pans that Mr. Theroux's wife, Sheila Donnelly Theroux, has given him over the years. (""The cabinet is full of failed pans,"" she said.) Thus far, he has had the greatest success with a forged-aluminum model by Zwilling J. A. Henckels, from which the omelet ripples to the plate like a silk handkerchief.

Eggs have been a motif on Mr. Theroux's many travels, hawked outside train stations from Tanzania to Siberia. On Savo Island, in the South Pacific, he survived on megapode eggs, disinterred from the sand where the birds had buried them and cooked in hot springs on the slopes of a volcano. In 1973, preparing for a trek across a newly kingless, restive Afghanistan, he stashed a hard-boiled egg in his pocket. It was half lunch, half talisman. ""I thought, if something goes wrong, I've got this egg,"" he said. ""Then a guy with a rifle shoved me and smashed it.""

When he lived in Malawi in the 1960s, he watched his Yao cook, a veteran of the King's African Rifles, break an egg ""very gently"" into a pan and spoon hot oil slowly over the yolk. But Mr. Theroux learned the most about cooking at hotels, ""shuffling down the buffet line,"" he said. ""Sometimes I stay by the egg station and watch.""

In his Hawaiian garden, he chops bamboo shoots, then skins and boils them. His Italian grandmother was a forager, too, digging up dandelion greens for salad. He remembers the scent of basil in her house and hand-rolled pasta drying on her dining table. She folded a tortellino ""like a classic Chinese won ton,"" he said. Hives once stood under the bamboo trees, but a few years ago, the colony collapsed and he hasn't had the heart to replace it. Occasionally, a wild pig blusters into the yard. Mr. Theroux shoots it, then entrusts it to a neighbor with a smoker. Long before the chicken coop, Mr. Theroux kept pigeons in a dovecote in Malawi. ""I ate them,"" he said. When asked if his chickens might one day meet a similar fate, he shook his head. ""I don't think they'd be very tasty -- skinny feral chickens,"" he said. ""I'd have to be pretty desperate.""",Omelets made by the author ripple to the plate like a silk handkerchief from the forged-aluminum model by Zwilling J.A.

Food,"Élan, David Waltuck's Flatiron Restaurant, Will Close",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/dining/elan-david-waltuck-flatiron-restaurant-will-close.html,"When David Waltuck returned to the kitchen about a year and a half ago with a new restaurant, Elan, and his famous seafood sausage on the menu, those who knew him from his days at the pioneering downtown restaurant Chanterelle cheered.

Now there is bound to be gloom, because Mr. Waltuck and his partner at Elan, George Stinson, plan to close the Flatiron district restaurant after dinner service at the end of the month.

""I would say it's mainly economics,"" Mr. Waltuck said in an interview Thursday. ""The rent is high -- not inappropriate. But we have a small restaurant, and it has not generated the level of business we had anticipated, and we don't know what we can do to change this.""

Pete Wells, awarding two stars to Elan in an October 2014 review, evoked the magic of Chanterelle, which opened in 1979 in SoHo, won four stars from The New York Times at various points, moved to TriBeCa and closed just short of its 30th anniversary.

Economy,U.S. Cuts Take Increasing Toll on Job Growth,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/03/business/economy/us-cuts-take-increasing-toll-on-job-growth.html,"WASHINGTON -- The number of federal workers forced to work shorter hours soared this summer -- to 199,000 in July, from 55,000 a year earlier -- in a sign of the problems that federal budget policy is causing for the economy. The Labor Department reported on Friday that the economy continued to add jobs in July and that the unemployment rate fell to 7.4 percent, from 7.6 percent. But the pace of job growth slowed somewhat from the first half of the year and remains modest enough that the economy is years away from a full recovery. Contributing to the hangover from the worst financial crisis in decades is a wave of cuts in domestic and military spending, known collectively as the sequester, which is causing government furloughs as well as job losses and curtailed hours among federal contractors. Although the sequester became law on March 1, some of the effects, like the forced leaves, have begun to ramp up only recently. More job losses, rather than shorter workweeks, are predicted if the cuts remain in place into next year.

Congress left on Friday for a summer recess of more than a month, after a week in which Republicans' divisions with one another and with President Obama suggested a new budget showdown may be coming in the fall. The disagreements leave no clear way to end the spending cuts that continue to slow the economy and could even lead to a more damaging government shutdown in October. Corporate and academic economists say that Washington's fiscal fights have produced budget policies that amount to a self-inflicted drag on the economy's recovery. Joseph J. Minarik, director of research at the corporate-supported Committee for Economic Development and a former government economist, said he could not remember in postwar times when fiscal policy was so at odds with the needs of the economy. ""The macroeconomic situation is highly unusual,"" he said, adding: ""We have to be concerned about our debt getting totally out of hand, so we are concerned about the federal budget. But the concern has got to be tempered by the fact that we have got to get some economic growth going as well."" The effects of the cuts could be found in the details of Friday's jobs report. Although federal government employment did not decline in July as it had in previous months this year, the number of people who were working part time because they could not get their employers to give them full-time hours rose significantly. This probably reflects decisions by many government agencies to achieve their required budget cuts by forcing employees to take unpaid leave.

At the Department of Defense, for example, 650,000 civilians must take off 11 days without pay -- generally once a week -- through September, when the current fiscal year ends. The Internal Revenue Service likewise scheduled one furlough day a month from May through August.
* Open or closed on Thanksgiving? Here are stores' plans for Thursday and Friday.
* The high cost of gas is forcing families to cut back on activities and essentials. On her first day at the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. Obama's new budget director, Sylvia Mathews Burwell, sought to meet employees and found many desks empty because it was a furlough day. And the new trade representative, Michael Froman, has struggled during his office's budget cuts to assign government lawyers to various negotiations abroad. In the private sector, employment at government contractors also appears to be falling as companies that do government research, provide custodial services and retrofit federal properties to be more energy-efficient, among other things, are informed of contract cancellations or delays in bids for new contracts -- partly because the federal workers arranging the bidding are being furloughed. ""The disjunction between textbook economics and the choices being made in Washington is larger than any I've seen in my lifetime,"" said Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan. ""At a time of mass unemployment, it's clear, the economics textbooks tell us, that this is not the right time for fiscal retrenchment."" Given that rough consensus in an otherwise quarrelsome profession, he added, ""To watch it be ignored like this is exasperating, horrifying, disheartening."" After the release of the jobs report, the first thought of many business forecasters was of the Federal Reserve, and what the data might suggest for its next move in September, when analysts believe it probably will begin tapering its stimulus measures known as quantitative easing. As the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has made clear -- including repeatedly to Congress -- the Fed has continued its stimulus policies in part to offset the drag from fiscal policy. So economists are watching, too, what the White House and the Republican-controlled House will do this fall as they once again confront two looming deadlines. First is Oct. 1, when government operations would shut down unless the two sides agree on spending levels for the fiscal year that starts that day. Perhaps in that same month, the Treasury will run out of ways to buy more time and Congress will have to raise the nation's borrowing limit, or else risk financial crisis or even default.

""Over all, fiscal drag has likely reduced growth this year at least 1.5 percentage points, and isn't over yet,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote to clients on Friday. ""The last thing the economy needs is a repeat performance. A key part of our optimistic forecast for next year is that there is not a sustained shutdown this fall; the latest bickering leaves us a little more concerned."" The uncertainty itself is causing some businesses to hold back on hiring or investing. ""Whether there's less fiscal drag, more fiscal drag, or a train wreck, we still really don't know,"" said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR. Congress's annual budget appropriations process was in chaos by the time lawmakers left town on Friday. Hardly any of the annual bills have gotten to the House or Senate floor yet, and Congress is scheduled to be in session just nine days in September before the Oct. 1 deadline. In the House, Republicans are split over domestic cuts demanded by the most conservative members that would go deeper than sequestration. And the Democratic-controlled Senate has so far been unable to move measures that would raise spending above sequester levels, closer to the less restrictive amounts that both parties had agreed to in a July 2011 deal that ended an economically damaging showdown over raising the government's borrowing limit. Senior administration officials and a group of Senate Republicans will continue to explore possible compromises during August, they say, but neither side sounds hopeful. Perhaps the best that can come of the fall showdown, according to people with knowledge of the issues, is a compromise that still would keep the so-called discretionary spending at the lowest levels in a half-century -- reducing the fiscal drag, but hardly providing the sort of stimulus that Mr. Obama has proposed. ""The private sector has been healing and that's helping to offset the adverse effects of the sequester. We're seeing the housing market turnaround, consumption has been a bit stronger the last couple of quarters,"" said Alan Krueger, a Princeton economist whose last day as Mr. Obama's chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers was Friday. ""But we know we can grow faster than 1.7 percent.""",A wave of cuts in domestic and military spending is causing government furloughs as well as job losses and curtailed hours among federal contractors.,f1b328ab-2002-51e4-b799-8cbfc35bcdba,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/03/business/FURLOUGH/FURLOUGH-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=353639bf74991dd2ac6cd083ebafd07c2ffb9e3d5d0058092484192381b4fcf8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Economists say that Washington's fiscal fights have produced budget policies that amount to a self-inflicted drag on the economy.,f1b328ab-2002-51e4-b799-8cbfc35bcdba,N24News/imgs/f1b328ab-2002-51e4-b799-8cbfc35bcdba.jpg,8

The recall comes about 27 months after Mercedes determined the cause of the problem and made a manufacturing change for replacement parts but did not recall the vehicles, according to the report.

The models affected by the recall are the C300; C300 4Matic; C350 and C63 AMG.

Mercedes said oxidation on a ground pin connector could cause the rear taillights to dim or fail completely. The automaker told N.H.T.S.A. that it was not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the problem. But the agency has said it received reports of five trunk fires stemming from the defect.

Mercedes said it received its first complaints in 2009, but didn't learn the cause of the lighting failures until December 2011. In January 2012, the automaker made a manufacturing change to replacement parts.","A wiring problem caused the recall, and a few customers reported minor trunk fires related to the defect.",8ef93175-7a92-59a1-a0b5-c5788a1a3802,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/30/automobiles/30RECALL-image/30RECALL-image-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=410&w=600&s=582e723f0251a92c2994f6f3766cc75c3f4e5ef0455d3f8f29817b14cfbb66cc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,The 2011 Mercedes-Benz C300 sedan.,8ef93175-7a92-59a1-a0b5-c5788a1a3802,N24News/imgs/8ef93175-7a92-59a1-a0b5-c5788a1a3802.jpg,23
Movies,"Venice Film Festival Opens, Defiant but Socially Distanced",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/movies/venice-film-festival-coronavirus.html,"VENICE -- Most of the movie fans attending this year's Venice Film Festival haven't been inside a theater for months. ""I got really emotional walking into the first screening, with people from all over the world celebrating cinema,"" said Laura Pritchard, 54, a British writer and script editor who lives here. ""I sobbed."" The only distraction from this intense moment, she said, was the mask she was wearing. ""They're not so effective when a film makes you cry and they get covered in tears,"" she said, laughing. The 77th edition of the festival, which opened Wednesday and runs through Sept. 12, is the first major international film event to take place since the coronavirus closed down movie theaters, film sets and public gatherings across the globe.

Other strict virus-prevention measures are also in place, with hand sanitizer stations at building entrances and accredited delegates' movements inside festival buildings tracked with scanned passes in case of an outbreak. Temperatures are checked on the way into screenings, and empty seats are mandatory between spectators. In many ways, the socially distanced movie theater experience is a comfortable one: There's room to stretch out, monopolizing the arm rests comes without guilt and you can stretch your legs out luxuriously. The communal experience of reacting to the big screen remains, just with more personal space. There are almost twice the usual number of screenings to accommodate smaller, socially distanced audiences, and the festival has two new outdoor screening spaces: one atop a skating rink on the Lido, a thin island on the Venetian lagoon; and another in gardens on Venice's main island. (Thankfully, the weather for the first few days of the festival has been dry and mild.)

""Having to wear masks even during screenings is a nightmare,"" said Marianna Serandrei, 54, a Venice native who has been attending the festival since she was a teenager. But ""human beings can actually get used to basically anything,"" she said, adding that she would tolerate wearing a mask if it meant being able to continue her annual festival tradition of seeing up to three films a day. Unlike in the United States, where mask wearing has become a divisive political issue, Italians are generally complying with the rules. But before the festival began, it appeared that face coverings could become a contested theme. On Aug. 25, the organizers announced that Cristi Puiu, a Romanian filmmaker who had been invited to sit on the competition jury, would stand down after ""unexpected difficulties"" arose. He has been replaced by the American actor Matt Dillon. The festival's spokeswoman said that Puiu was not attending for ""personal reasons,"" but many news media outlets speculated that the decision had been influenced by a speech he gave when introducing his new film, ""Malmkrog,"" onstage at the Transylvania International Film Festival last month.

According to local media reports, Puiu said it was ""inhuman"" to force audience members to wear masks to watch the movie, which is 200 minutes long. He did not respond to a request to comment for this article. This year's lineup includes films from more than 50 countries, and for the first time in a decade, the opening film was from Italy: Daniele Luchetti's ""Lacci,"" a twisty marriage drama set in Naples. Pedro Almodovar's new short film, ""The Human Voice,"" starring Tilda Swinton and based on a play by Jean Cocteau, was on view this week, and later in the festival the much anticipated ""Nomadland,"" from Chloe Zhao and ""One Night in Miami,"" Regina King's directorial debut, will premiere.

But with travel to Italy from the United States still restricted and the event's usual Hollywood star power dimmed, this year's festival has an especially European feel. This was emphasized by Alberto Barbera, the festival's artistic director, who invited directors from seven major European film festivals -- including Thierry Fremaux of Cannes -- to open the event. Many of these festivals, like Cannes, won't have in-person events this year, although Spain's San Sebastian Film Festival will go ahead this month and the Czech Republic's Karlovy Vary International Film Festival is slated for November. At a news conference on Wednesday, Barbera called the other directors' presence at Venice an expression of solidarity. Film festival leaders usually compete -- for films, for jury members -- but this year has seen a more collaborative approach, Barbera said.

""Watching movies on streaming services has helped us survive over the last few months,"" he said, but ""the risk is that we have a progressive reduction of the role of theater cinema in the film industry."" Across the world, movie theaters are starting to reopen after being closed for months, and again and again on the festival's stages, stars and administrators made the case for the big screen. At the opening ceremony, Cate Blanchett, the president of the competition jury, said that ""cinema comes alive when it's an event.""

It was ""very tough,"" said Serandrei, the festival regular, who runs two hotels in the city. Now, with travel restrictions to Italy lifted from many European countries, visitors are trickling back, posing for photos on bridges and taking expensive gondola rides. The film festival created a buzz that residents said they appreciated after months of deserted streets. ""During the height of the quarantine, Venice, for all its beauty, was dead,"" Pritchard said. ""Any return to life feels like a good thing. Even if they're buying plastic junk!""",Strict measures are in place at the first major international movie event since the coronavirus pandemic began.,614d8878-f0e5-5cef-ab61-38bac0f9988a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/05/arts/04notebook-venice1/04notebook-venice1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=be8eb267db5e1d5ce5f4e343a99fd4b62017f7f2e909b84712276688e8e3a316&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Stars arriving at the Palazzo del Cinema on Thursday for a Venice Film Festival screening.,614d8878-f0e5-5cef-ab61-38bac0f9988a,N24News/imgs/614d8878-f0e5-5cef-ab61-38bac0f9988a.jpg,5
Science,Tribes' Win in Fight for La Jolla Bones Clouds Hopes for DNA Studies,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/02/science/tribes-win-in-fight-for-la-jolla-bones-clouds-hopes-for-dna-studies.html,"The San Diego Archaeology Center holds a pair of extraordinary skeletons. Dating back about 9,500 years, they are among the oldest human remains ever found in the Americas. A number of scientists would love to study the bones, using powerful new techniques to extract any surviving DNA. ""These skeletons of such antiquity are so important for helping us understand what happened in the past in North America,"" said Brian Kemp, a molecular anthropologist at Washington State University. But for years, the remains have been out of reach, the subject of a legal struggle that pitted three University of California scientists against their own administration and the Kumeyaay, a group of Native American tribes.

The skeletons were found in San Diego's La Jolla community in 1976 by an archaeology class digging on land owned by the University of California, San Diego. In 2006, a group of tribes laid claim to the skeletons, and the university later agreed to transfer custody. To block the transfer, the scientists went to court. After losing in lower courts, the scientists in November asked the United States Supreme Court to become involved. This week, the court declined. That decision swept away the last obstacle to the transfer. ""It's hard to describe how bad I feel,"" said Robert L. Bettinger, one of the plaintiffs in the case and a professor at the University of California, Davis. ""To have them slip through our fingers this way is a tremendous loss for science."" Steven Banegas, spokesman for the Kumeyaay Cultural Repatriation Committee, which claimed the skeletons, said the tribes would meet to decide what to do with the remains. He did not rule out that scientists could study them. ""These things we need to discuss,"" he said. ""We want to be the ones who tell our own story."" At the time the skeletons were found, archaeologists were relatively free to do with Native American remains as they saw fit. That changed with the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990. The law was a response to some ugly chapters in the history of research on Native Americans. Grave robbers had plundered skeletons and sacred objects, some of which were stockpiled in museums.

The act established a legal procedure by which Native Americans could claim cultural objects and human remains kept in museums or found on public land. More than 1.4 million objects and remains of 50,000 people have been transferred under the act, but some cases have sparked conflicts. In 1996, for example, hikers stumbled across an 8,500-year-old skeleton in Kennewick, Wash. Native American tribes claimed the skeleton, intending to rebury it. But scientists challenged their claim, and after eight years of legal battling, they won the opportunity to study the remains. Most recently, geneticists retrieved enough DNA from the Kennewick Man's bones to reconstruct his entire genome. Last year, the scientists reported that he was closely related to living Native Americans. That finding strongly weighed against earlier claims that Kennewick Man might be related to Polynesians or even Europeans. Ancient skeletons like Kennewick Man and the La Jolla remains can offer clues to how humans spread across the Americas. Researchers generally agree that people moved from Asia over the Bering Land Bridge roughly 15,000 years ago. How they spread from there is still the subject of fierce debate. Did they move down through the center of North America? Did their route hug the coast? The La Jolla remains, excavated from a cliff overlooking the Pacific, could offer some clarity. The Kumeyaay Cultural Repatriation Committee, representing 12 bands of Native Americans in Southern California, filed a claim for the La Jolla remains in 2006. To determine what connection the remains might have to its people, the committee asked Arion Mayes, a San Diego State anthropologist who had worked on Kumeyaay skeletons, to conduct an examination, on the condition that she not destroy any of the material. ""It was a great honor,"" Dr. Mayes said.

Dr. Mayes found clues about what the two people had been like in life. One was a man who died in his mid- to late 20s. He had a strong right arm that he may have built up through the use of a spear thrower. The other, a woman in her late 30s or early 40s, had teeth that showed signs of having been worn down by stripping fibers for making baskets. ""She used her teeth as tools,"" Dr. Mayes said. The University of California, for its part, appointed a committee of professors to evaluate the tribes' claim. In 2008, they concluded that the skeletons were ""culturally unidentifiable."" The grave contained no objects that might have established a cultural link, and the committee found no compelling evidence that these were ancient relatives of the Kumeyaay people. Even so, Dr. Bettinger, a member of the committee, said in an interview that he grew concerned that the university would rush a transfer of the skeletons, and that the Kumeyaay would deny access. So in 2010, he asked the university for permission to study the remains. So did Margaret J. Schoeninger, an anthropologist at the University of California, San Diego, and Tim D. White of the University of California, Berkeley. Dr. Schoeninger was denied, and Dr. Bettinger and Dr. White say they never received a response. Instead, the University of California announced that in 2011, the skeletons would be given to the La Posta Band, one of the Kumeyaay bands. Dr. Bettinger, Dr. Schoeninger and Dr. White sued to stop the transfer, arguing that the university had not made an adequate finding about the skeletons. Dr. Kemp of Washington State, who filed an amicus brief on behalf of the scientists, said the university had failed to meet the requirements of the repatriation act. ""The law hasn't been followed,"" he said. But the court arguments didn't directly address the university's actions or the scientific importance of the skeletons. The University of California argued that the Kumeyaay bands had to be joined in the suit. Because the bands had tribal immunity, the university argued, the scientists couldn't sue them.

A district court agreed and dismissed the suit. In 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit also ruled against the scientists. In November, the scientists petitioned the Supreme Court to send the case back to the circuit court to consider whether tribal immunity can be invoked in claims arising under the repatriation act. The court rejected the petition with no explanation. ""It's a tragedy and a disgrace -- a tragedy for science, and a disgrace for the court,"" said James McManis, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. Mr. McManis said the decision could leave researchers at a disadvantage because tribes will be able to claim immunity in disputes over remains. The Supreme Court's denial marks the end of the road for the scientists. The task now, said Dorothy Alther, the lawyer for the Kumeyaay, is ""to contact the university and see what the next steps are for repatriation."" Kate Moser, a spokeswoman for the University of California, said by email, ""We believe the university process has achieved a decision that is in accordance with both the law and our commitment to the respectful handling of human remains and associated artifacts."" Dr. Mayes said she hoped that scientists and Native Americans would find more constructive ways to resolve such conflicts. ""When you end up in the courts, things get volatile and the conversation gets lost,"" she said. ""Only by having mutual respect will we have a positive situation in the future."" While some tribes have rejected ancient DNA studies, others have decided to go forward with them. Mr. Banegas wouldn't rule out that possibility for the La Jolla remains once they come into Kumeyaay custody. ""That's not off the table,"" he said. ""I wouldn't want anyone to think we're closed off.""","For years, the remains have been out of reach, the subject of a legal struggle that pitted 3 scientists against their own administration and the Kumeyaay.",7952fef3-4868-5eb0-a444-504cde29561f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/02/science/02SKELETONS/02SKELETONS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=15455ceb87ea179ab42474d3062e59e2a54a55009a4ba4e86fceac07fb521b7e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Skeletons discovered in 1976 in the La Jolla community of San Diego that date back 9,500 years.",7952fef3-4868-5eb0-a444-504cde29561f,N24News/imgs/7952fef3-4868-5eb0-a444-504cde29561f.jpg,2
Music,Opera Has a Problem: Fans Aren't Subscribing,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/arts/music/opera-subscriptions-lyric-chicago.html,"CHICAGO -- It looked like a typo. For many years, until as recently as 2001, Lyric Opera of Chicago reported selling more than 100 percent of its capacity. The company was not squeezing opera buffs into the aisles of its Art Deco opera house, which sits at the base of a 45-story limestone skyscraper on the Chicago River. No, back then Lyric largely sold out to subscribers, who would donate tickets they couldn't use back to the company -- which could (and often would) sell them a second time. [See what our critics chose as the best classical events of 2018.] [And listen to our favorite recordings of the year.]

But those days are gone. Now Lyric, like other major American opera companies, as well as symphony orchestras, theater troupes and many sports teams, is grappling with a long-term decline in season subscribers. Current audiences are seen as less likely to buy large packages of tickets or commit to attending events months in advance. The decline in subscribers is upending the already fragile economics of opera, changing how companies operate and what they program. Lyric now gives a quarter fewer main stage opera performances than it did two decades ago -- it gave 60 last season -- and has started presenting a musical each spring. Its pared-back opera season led the company's orchestra to briefly strike in October, when management sought (and eventually won) cuts to the number of weeks the musicians work, as well as to the number of full-time members of the orchestra.

One problem is that decline in subscriptions has not been offset by recent increases in single-ticket sales, so attendance is down overall. Attracting individual ticket buyers also costs more than selling subscription packages. And since subscribers have been a dependable pipeline of new donors, their falloff comes at a particularly painful moment when ticket sales, even at high prices, cover a smaller and smaller fraction of the cost of putting on opera. Lyric retains one of the strongest subscriber bases in opera; it still sells twice as many tickets to subscribers as to single-ticket buyers. But the number of tickets it sells to subscribers has fallen to less than half what it sold two decades ago.

For the San Francisco Opera, which a few decades ago sold three-quarters of its tickets to subscribers, that number is now approaching half. The change has been even more dramatic at the Metropolitan Opera, which now sells fewer than a fifth of its tickets to subscribers. Although the Met sold 78,000 tickets to newcomers last season, and sells far more single tickets than ever before, it is hard to make up for the loss of patrons who once attended many times a year. The company took in only 67 percent of potential box-office revenue last season, but with discounts factored in, paid attendance averaged 75 percent. (The Met, the biggest opera company in the nation, gave 224 performances last season -- near four times as many as Lyric.) Next season, the company plans to add more-convenient Sunday matinees and begin going dark on Mondays, once the night of choice for New York's high-society subscribers.

The change is also hitting symphony orchestras, many of which were founded on the subscription model. According to the League of American Orchestras, 2013 was the first year that revenue from single-ticket buyers and group sales surpassed subscription income. The shift has begun to change how and what operas program. San Francisco Opera's former general director, David Gockley, once explained the impact of relying on single-ticket sales in a frank program note that said ""each title has to survive on its ability to attract an audience, whereas previously it could be slipped into a bigger package."" And Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Met, said in an interview that since each production now has to bring in its own audience, the company seeks stronger casts for all of its operas than it sometimes had in the past. Marc A. Scorca, the president and chief executive of Opera America, a service organization, said that there have been concerns in the industry that weakening subscription sales could lead to safer programming choices. ""In the old days, when things nearly sold out fully on subscription, opera number three and opera number seven could be rare works, new works,"" he said. ""Now that more of the house is sold on a single-ticket basis, one has to be thoughtful of what the titles are."" At Lyric, Mr. Freud said that popular works such as ""La Boheme"" still do well at the box office, but that donors are increasingly interested in supporting new or rare works, such as Jimmy Lopez's ""Bel Canto,"" which had its premiere at Lyric in 2015.

""A diet of war horses is never going to work for us -- partly because we will dilute their box-office strength if we schedule them too often, and partly because we won't be taking full advantage of contributed revenue potential,"" he said. The company has been working to increase revenue and cut expenses. Its spring musicals sell tens of thousands of tickets, and bring new audiences into the opera house; Lyric finds that it is able to persuade about a fifth of those newcomers to return for an opera.

Lyric also owns its theater and has been working to increase income from rentals. The Pet Shop Boys have performed there, and the company recently struck a deal to make the opera house the Chicago home of the Joffrey Ballet, beginning in 2020. The company has also increased outreach to Chicago schools and communities new to opera with Lyric Unlimited, an ambitious education program. But there have been setbacks as well: After losing philanthropic support, the company discontinued its longstanding radio broadcasts of its opening nights.

Mounting the new ""Ring"" cycle has been a major and expensive undertaking. Lyric's ""Siegfried"" boasted world-class singers, led by the dramatic soprano Christine Goerke and the bass-baritone Eric Owens. Opening night was sold out, and before the performance the crowd gathered in the lobby and snapped selfies, picked up rolls from the ""Sushi at Lyric"" window and sampled a Wagnerian-theme cocktail called the Fafner, named after the opera's sleeping dragon. ""I would say that I worry about opera in the United States,"" said Howard Smith, 88, who was at the performance. ""We all started coming in our 30s or late 20s, and you don't see as much of that. There are so many other venues for entertainment."" He took in ""Siegfried"" from the orchestra seat he has occupied -- on subscription -- since 1961.",Lyric Opera of Chicago and other major companies are trying to adjust to a new financial reality.,ff6bdfe8-d598-597b-83ba-ad992b080ff7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/22/arts/22CHICAGO-OPERA1/22CHICAGO-OPERA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=e734687890181eb0c9a5ad1a9cd2664f65e6c574156c3c3400409e8e3322d1ab&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Scenes from the opening night of Wagner's ""Siegfried"" at Lyric Opera of Chicago in November.

Science,Scientists Ponder an Evolutionary Mystery: The Female Orgasm,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/science/scientists-puzzle-over-a-biological-mystery-the-female-orgasm.html,"An eye is for seeing, a nose is for smelling. Many aspects of the human body have obvious purposes. But some defy easy explanation. For biologists, few phenomena are as mysterious as the female orgasm. While orgasms have an important role in a woman's intimate relationships, the evolutionary roots of the experience -- a combination of muscle contractions, hormone release, and intense pleasure -- have been difficult to uncover. For decades, researchers have put forward theories, but none are widely accepted. Now two evolutionary biologists have joined the fray, offering a new way of thinking about the female orgasm based on a reconstruction of its ancient history. On Monday, in The Journal of Experimental Zoology, the authors conclude that the response originated in mammals more than 150 million years ago as a way to release eggs to be fertilized after sex.

Until now, few scientists have investigated the biology of distantly related animals for clues to the mystery. ""For orgasms, we kept it reserved for humans and primates,"" said Mihaela Pavlicev, an evolutionary biologist at University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and an author of the new paper. ""We didn't look to other species to dig deeper and look for the origin."" The male orgasm has never caused much of a stir among evolutionary biologists. The pleasure is precisely linked to ejaculation, the most important step in passing on a male's genes to the next generation. That pleasure encourages men to deliver more sperm, which is evolutionarily advantageous. For women, the evolutionary path is harder to figure out. The muscle contractions that occur during an orgasm are not essential for a woman to become pregnant. And while most men can experience an orgasm during sex, it's less reliable for women. In a 2010 survey, 35.6 percent of women said that they hadn't had an orgasm the most recent time they had sex. Part of the reason for this is anatomy: the clitoris is physically separated from the vagina.

Still, a number of scientists suspect that the female orgasm serves some biological function favored by natural selection. They just need to figure out what it is. ""My gut instinct is that something that matters so much at an emotional level -- the intense pleasure of orgasm -- would seem to have reproductive consequences,"" said David A. Puts, an evolutionary anthropologist at Pennsylvania State University. Many hypotheses have been put forward. Dr. Puts and his colleagues have carried out studies to test the possibility that orgasms increase the odds that a woman's eggs are fertilized by a genetically attractive male. Elisabeth A. Lloyd, a philosopher at Indiana University, isn't buying it. In 2005, she published a book called ""The Case of the Female Orgasm,"" in which she reviewed 18 published theories about its function. None had strong evidence in its favor, she concluded, and many were undermined by other findings about human sexuality. Years of further research have only strengthened her skepticism. Dr. Lloyd thinks the best explanation for the female orgasm is that it hasn't served any evolutionary purpose at all. It's nothing more than the byproduct of the development of the male orgasm. The orgasm is to women, she believes, as nipples are to men. But now Dr. Pavlicev and her colleague, Gunter P. Wagner of Yale University, are making the case that the human female orgasm has a deep evolutionary history that reaches back to early mammals.

They began by getting better acquainted with the sex lives of other animals, poring through obscure old journals to gather information on species ranging from aardvarks to koalas. They noted that many female mammals release oxytocin and prolactin during sex -- the hormones released by women during orgasms. What's more, in many of those species, females use a radically different kind of reproduction. While women release an egg each month, other female mammals, such as rabbits and camels, release an egg only after mating with a male. Ovulatory cycles evolved in only a few lineages of mammals, including our own, Dr. Pavlicev and Dr. Wagner found. Before then, our ancient mammal ancestors originally relied on ovulation triggered by sex with a male. Those early mammals developed a clitoris inside the vagina. Only in mammals that evolved ovulatory cycles did the clitoris move away. Based on these findings, Dr. Pavlicev and Dr. Wagner argue that the female orgasm first evolved as a reflex to help females become pregnant. When early mammals mated, the clitoris could send signals to the brain, triggering hormones that released an egg. Once the egg became fertilized, the hormones may have helped ensure it became implanted in the uterus.

This arrangement has worked well for mammals that rarely encounter males. It helps females make the most of each mating. But eventually some mammals, including primates like us, started spending their lives in social groups. Females had access to regular sex with males, and orgasm as an ovulatory mechanism was no longer so useful. Our female forebears instead evolved a new system: releasing eggs in a regular cycle. As the original purpose of the orgasm was lost, the clitoris moved away from its original position. Dr. Wagner speculated that this shift was part of evolution's dismantling of a sensor system: ""You don't want to have the old signal sending noise at the wrong time,"" he said. ""Basically, we don't know why this happened,"" he added. But across mammalian species, ""it's just a very strong evolutionary pattern."" Dr. Lloyd and Dr. Puts welcomed the new study as a provocative addition to the debate over the female orgasms. ""I'm pretty excited that it's being published,"" Dr. Lloyd said, ""because people are going to start talking about female orgasms and getting a fresh look at how much we don't know about female orgasms, and thinking hard about what we need to know."" The new theory may shed light on how the human female orgasm first evolved, but Dr. Pavlicev and Dr. Wagner said that it doesn't settle the debate about its current role in women. ""All directions are open,"" Dr. Wagner said.",Two evolutionary biologists have offered a new way of thinking about the experience based on a reconstruction of its ancient history.,aab8db15-10c2-5469-b4a5-a117933fcd33,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/02/science/02ZIMMER/02ZIMMER-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=aaec31eb42f57ca3be76cbab5db5350501f4e5a638fcd8780b685c6cae8ce88e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Evolutionary biologists offered a new way of thinking about the female orgasm based on a reconstruction of its ancient history.,aab8db15-10c2-5469-b4a5-a117933fcd33,N24News/imgs/aab8db15-10c2-5469-b4a5-a117933fcd33.jpg,2
Travel,"In Omaha, a Progressive Approach to Free Time",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/travel/frugal-omaha.html,"""Hey! Lucas, right?"" I heard a voice as I walked around the Gifford Park Neighborhood Market, a compact but lively farmers' market that was a quick walk from the room I was renting on Cass Street in Omaha. The voice belonged to Alex O'Hanlon, whom I'd met just a couple of days earlier at a donation-based fermentation workshop she had led at City Sprouts, a local organization with a large community garden that promotes health and seeks to improve food quality in the community. Alex and I chatted, and I shared some tamales I'd bought from a market vendor. Remembering my name and saying hello was maybe a small gesture for Alex, but as an out-of-towner, I was impressed. But I wasn't really surprised that the locals were friendly in Omaha, the biggest city in Nebraska, located about halfway between Sioux Falls, S.D., and Kansas City, Mo. What surprised me during a recent four-day trip was how big the city seemed. I'm not talking about surface area: Omaha, in addition to its famous zoo, has a progressive sensibility that places its good restaurants, live-music scene and diverse entertainment options on par with cities many times its size. And it's worth a visit for any curious traveler who, like me, is keen on saving money. My Airbnb host, Orenda, was accommodating when a flight cancellation led me to arrive a day later than expected (my private room with bath was $41 a night). She and her partner, both musicians, gave me some recommendations for activities in the area, and let me use their driveway for the car I'd rented through Turo.

This was the first time I had used Turo, a service that operates something like Airbnb and lets private citizens list and rent out their own cars online. The high rates from the national agencies made me get past my trepidation of renting from a total stranger, and I picked a Hyundai Accent from a woman named Stephanie for $33 a day. Luckily, Stephanie was an old hand and she made the pickup and drop-off of the car seamless. One difference with Turo is that there are frequently limits on the number of miles you can drive your rental (300 in my case) -- be careful not to exceed your maximum, or you'll pay an extra fee. I also made good use of the public bus system, which I found to be a reliable way of making short trips. I bought a book of 10 rides ($12.50) at a local supermarket, and set out to see the city. My first stop was at Artifact, a store that specializes in handmade aprons and tote bags. The Omaha-based brand, which got its start on Etsy, makes its products locally. I was even encouraged to peek into a large area behind the showroom to watch some items being sewn and assembled. They're not exactly for shoppers on a budget, however: Some run well over $100, so I picked up a locally made bar of eucalyptus and rosemary soap from Benson Soap Mill ($6).

The nearby Joslyn Art Museum, just south of Creighton University, was a logical next stop: The only thing better than a world-class art collection is a free world-class art collection. The Joslyn's collection includes exceptional examples of work from the ancient world, Renaissance and Baroque masterpieces, modern and contemporary art, and pieces inspired by the American West. The museum also made very effective use of multimedia in one of the first exhibits I saw. Using a small touch-screen, visitors can watch an examination of a Madonna-and-Child triptych, painted by an unknown artist, that carefully explores the work, section by section, explaining its style, composition and symbolism. It explains how the museum came to deduce that the painting was likely done in the early 16th century by a follower of the Flemish artist Jan Gossaert. All in all, a fascinating and educational whodunit for a painting I might otherwise have overlooked.

Head upstairs for the American Indian art collection, with artifacts like ration ticket bags and medicine pouches from the Ute and Sioux tribes, as well as work like the pictograph-based ""Horse Sense (for advice and council)"" by the New Mexican artist Jaune Quick-To-See Smith. El Museo Latino ($5 admission) features Hispanic and Latino art and history and also serves as a cultural center. A larger-than-life textile exhibit from the Mexican artist Marcela Diaz was particularly enjoyable, and included a comically large hammock woven from coconut fibers. Some exceptionally beautiful prints were also on display, like Gabriel Macotela's ""Ruinas de la Independencia"" and Manolo Roldan's ""Fragile."" I won't spend too much time singing the praises of the Omaha Zoo, which has been one of Omaha's major tourist draws for decades, but I can't leave it out because it is too good to miss, especially if you have children. The minute you enter the gate ($21.95 for adults, $15.95 for children) and see the awe-inspiring geodesic Desert Dome, you know you're in for a treat. Don't miss the primates, particularly the Western Lowland gorillas and Diana monkeys, as well as the lemur enclosure: Red-Ruffed lemurs are running free, sidling up close enough to touch (but don't). To experience nature in a slightly different way, head farther south to the Fontenelle Forest Nature Center, on the Nebraska-Iowa border. The serene forest ($11 admission), along the Missouri River, has miles of trails of varying degrees of difficulty for those looking for a healthy hike. Don't miss the Raptor Woodland Refuge, where the center rehabilitates injured birds of prey. On my visit, Rusty, a red-tailed hawk suffering from a gunshot wound, and Minerva, a great horned owl that suffered two broken wings after a car hit her, both seemed to be recovering admirably.

Omaha's Old Market area, a charming concentration of repurposed buildings over a century old, is worth a quick visit. Once the home wholesale and retail grocers in the city, there are now art galleries, shops and restaurants lining the brick streets. I parked my car in a $1-an-hour lot and stopped for an iced tea at Urban Abbey, which might best be described as a coffeehouse of worship, as it combines both a church and a coffeehouse. There are modern church services in the shop's warm, open space (""The World According to Mister Rogers"" is the name of one sermon series) and part of my purchase ($2.50 for a mango peach iced tea) went to benefit Nebraska Appleseed, an organization that supports immigrant rights. I wondered if activism with a decidedly progressive bent struggled to thrive in a state as red as Nebraska, and I asked Eithne Leahy, an Omaha native who was working behind the counter. ""It sort of works,"" she said. ""There's lots of great work being done on a grass-roots level with nonprofits and churches. But with the government ..."" She paused. ""Not so much.""

There's as much to do in Omaha at night as there is during the day. A hip-hop variety night at the Reverb Lounge, hosted by D.J. Houston Alexander, was a great place to kick back with an Old Style beer ($3.50) and enjoy music by local artists. Brothers Lounge, with carpeting and a fireplace, had a pleasingly dingy atmosphere that went well with the $1 bag of Gardetto's and $4 Pyramid apricot ale I purchased. I snacked and listened to a couple of bands ($5 cover) that were playing that evening: The dreamy, synth-heavy Rogue Moon, and Media Jeweler, a four-piece outfit that I can best describe as Weezer meets Frank Zappa. While I only caught the tail end of their show, I thoroughly enjoyed Dent May, a Los Angeles-based band playing at the Slowdown ($12). Their song ""Born Too Late"" was both pop-y and wistful; I liked it so much, I bought a band T-shirt. But little could compare to Hard Candy Omaha ($20), a drag show hosted by the Max, a gay club on Jackson Street downtown. In a sauna-like room jam-packed with people, the evening's M.C. introduced a series of impeccably dressed performers who lip-synced, vogued and cartwheeled down a short runway to different popular songs (and the dollar bills of appreciative audience members). Finally, the M.C. gave the crowd what it had eagerly been awaiting. ""Are you ready for something thin, white and salty?"" he asked. The crowd roared with enthusiasm as the evening's headliner, Miz Cracker, a popular drag performer who was on the reality series RuPaul's Drag Race, came onstage to ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" and blew the roof off. Nourishment is needed after any good night out, and Omaha proved more than up to the challenge. Steak is synonymous with the city, but good steak isn't cheap. Fortunately, there are a number of good steakhouses with reasonably priced lunchtime options. The Drover is one, a dimly-lit, cavernous restaurant with a very tasty seven-ounce, whisky-marinated sirloin ($15.95). Johnny's Cafe, opened in 1922, greets diners with a vaguely intimidating, elaborately wrought set of metal front doors. Two long, pointed steer horns that act as handles foreshadow the meal to come. Johnny's is a relic from a bygone era: red leather booths, martinis and plenty of taxidermy adorning the walls. The lunch special, a $9.96 prime rib sandwich (so-priced for the 96th anniversary of the restaurant) with fries and coleslaw, is tough to beat. Check out Farine and Four if you're after coffee -- the bright, spacious cafe with an open kitchen also served a mean $8 herring toast when I visited. Nearby Spielbound is a good option, too. A board game cafe with more than 2,000 games ($5 for a day pass), it also serves coffee, beer and food. I stopped in for a good $3.75 hibiscus iced tea. On the slightly more upscale side of the dining spectrum, Yoshitomo in the Benson neighborhood made for a great sushi stop one afternoon during their weekday happy hour (4 to 6 p.m.). The yaki gindara, torched sablefish with yuzu miso ($7.50), was particularly good. And then there's the Alpine Inn. It's tough to explain my immediate love for this magnificent, slightly off-kilter establishment. Is it the outstanding fried chicken, hot and juicy on the inside with skin that shatters like the shell on a creme brulee? Or is it the outdoor platform where raccoons and cats gnaw on the discarded chicken bones and potato wedges?","Nebraska's largest city has a vibrant music scene, a coffeehouse that includes a church (or vice versa), and many ways to experience the American West.",e2086d33-bff0-599d-bd3c-48e75e6286c7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/21/travel/21Frugal-Omaha2/21Frugal-Omaha2-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=cf6533b8cfa4b5f032214bc8d4667cd0783ce4e611af235cbcf0001f00c7a1f0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Omaha's Old Market District has galleries, shops and restaurants in repurposed buildings that are more than 100 years old.",e2086d33-bff0-599d-bd3c-48e75e6286c7,N24News/imgs/e2086d33-bff0-599d-bd3c-48e75e6286c7.jpg,4

But without a broad agreement, a series of automatic increases will take effect next year. What are investors to do? While there are still three months until Election Day, recent action in Washington did little to suggest the spirit of compromise is in the air. The Senate has voted to raise taxes on the wealthy, while the House has voted to keep taxes low for everyone. I was curious to see how people affected by any increases in the tax on investment income were dealing with the uncertainty. That tax is set to go up at least 3.8 percentage points -- the amount of the surtax on high earners in President Obama's health care legislation. But it could go up much more if lawmakers do not come to an agreement. I decided to call a few wealthy investors to ask how the prospect of the increase was affecting their investment decisions. More on them in a bit.

First, what are the increases? The 3.8 percent surtax will be levied on investment income for individuals who earn more than $200,000 a year, or $250,000 for a couple. The Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, has said he will repeal the health care law on his first day in office. But his first day, if he wins, won't be until Jan. 20, 2013, and even then, the most he could do would be to send legislation to Congress. So it is best to plan as if that tax will be levied. The more difficult taxes to estimate are on capital gains and dividends. The capital gains tax is 15 percent and is set to go to 20 percent next year if the tax cuts from the George W. Bush administration expire. (Counting the 3.8 percent surtax, the capital gains tax will be either 18.8 percent or 23.8 percent for high earners.) The dividend tax is also 15 percent, but it could go as high as the income tax rate. If the Bush tax cuts expire, the rate for the highest earners would be 39.6 percent. But those people would also be subject to the additional 3.8 percent surtax, bringing the total dividend tax to as much as 43.4 percent. (Until 2003, dividends were taxed as income.) It is easy to see how the dividend tax could quickly wipe out the benefit of holding dividend-paying stocks. The capital gains tax is trickier because it is paid only when someone sells an investment that has appreciated. Still, the addition of the 3.8 percent to the existing capital gains tax can be a big number on any transaction that results in a large capital gain. Michael E. Goodman, a certified public accountant and president of Wealthstream Advisors in New York, said he had a client who was trying to sell an apartment in Manhattan for a price that would result in a taxable gain of $2 million. This year, she would pay $300,000 in capital gains taxes. But if she cannot sell the apartment until next year, she would pay at least an additional $76,000 because of the 3.8 percent surtax. If the capital gains rate goes up to 20 percent as well, her total tax bill on the sale of the apartment would be $476,000, or nearly 60 percent more than today. So what should people do? I spoke to several members of Tiger 21, an investment club that requires its members to have a minimum net worth of $10 million. Tiger 21 members have substantial wealth, and they spend time each month going over one another's portfolios. They raised three points that could help any affluent person.

One strategy is to use the prospect of increased taxes to examine all long-held investments and sell any with big gains before the end of the year. That is what Leslie C. Quick III says he is doing. His wealth came from the sale of Quick & Reilly, the discount brokerage firm that was started by his family and bought by Fleet Financial Services in 1997. After subsequent mergers, his Fleet stock is now Bank of America stock. That stock peaked at nearly $55 in late 2006 but is now trading around $7 per share. ""Our basis was zero, so even at $7 you still have a gain,"" he said. ""You keep hoping against hope that it's going to recover, but it's going to be a long slog."" Mr. Quick said he was focusing on cleaning up various portfolios of securities that he had neglected over the years. ""Some have done well, so I'm thinking before the end of the year I should sell some of these positions before taking another 3.8 percent hit,"" he said. The Tiger 21 members also recommended that the wealthy modify their investments to reduce the impact of the increase. Randy R. Beeman, who made his fortune buying and selling businesses and is now a financial adviser with Baird, a wealth management firm, said he was looking to buy more municipal bonds. For the last couple of years, he has owned more taxable corporate bonds because their yields were high enough to offset the tax-free benefits of municipal bonds. Now, he said, the tax increase makes municipal bonds more attractive. He is making a bigger change with his real estate holdings. Mr. Beeman said his wife would start to actively manage the properties they rent out. He says he believes that by doing this, the rents will no longer be categorized as passive income, which is subject to the surtax.

""If you have one town house generating a couple of thousand dollars a year, it's probably not worth it,"" he said. ""If you have 10 properties and each one is generating $15,000 in net income, then it is worthwhile. It's a matter of size and if you have the time and ability to do it."" For the most part, though, the Tiger 21 members said their bigger concern was finding investments that actually rose in value, regardless of what tax they might eventually pay. Reginald K. Brack, the former chairman and chief executive of Time Inc., said he was now more focused on making long-term investments. ""I sell these investments when there is a profit to be made,"" he said. ""Now, if the capital gains tax is changed dramatically, that might change things. But it was higher at one time. We'll live through it."" Michael Sonnenfeldt, who became wealthy in real estate before starting Tiger 21, said a poll of the group's 192 members after the second quarter found that, on average, they had increased their allocation to private equity by four percentage points. He interpreted this as meaning members were more concerned about getting a return on their money than about any tax they might later pay. Personally, he said, the increased investment tax would affect his thinking only on investments that had a low return or that he was hesitant about in the first place. ""If someone came to me and said, 'I have a software program that rivals Facebook and you can put $1 million into it today and we'll have one billion customers in eight years,' the 3.8 percent doesn't matter,"" Mr. Sonnenfeldt said. ""But when you get down to investments where the risks are lower and the returns are lower, then the 3.8 percent will make more of a difference.""","The Senate has voted to raise taxes on the wealthy, while the House has voted to keep taxes low for everyone and compromise seems unlikely.

Opinion,Trump's Favorite Four-Letter Word,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/24/opinion/Trump-hoax-fake-news.html,"The Trump era is the hoax era. But not in the way he or his cheerleaders claim.

Donald Trump has shouted ""hoax"" hundreds of times, about everything from climate change to Supreme Court rulings to impeachment. At this point, his copious claims about hoaxes add up to a hoax. And through the history of his use of this single word, we can see how he has fooled his biggest fans but failed to persuade almost everyone else.

During his 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump didn't rely on the word ""hoax."" He didn't even say ""fake news."" He called the news media ""sick"" and biased, but he didn't seriously start to deny its legitimacy until January 2017, when he was confronted by evidence that the Russian government aided his election. That's when he truly needed the news to be fake.

Looking back, Mr. Trump's exploitation of the term ""fake news"" to smear journalists was the single most consequential thing he did during the transition period. He built the scaffolding for his supporters to reject any and all information that wasn't Trump-approved.

After a few months, when ""fake news"" lost its power through sheer repetition, Mr. Trump introduced something far more sinister: a hoax. Something can be ""fake news"" by accident -- a typo in a quote, a mistake made on deadline -- but a hoax is malicious.","The president didn't always love the word, ""hoax.""

Opinion,Coronavirus Doesn't Care Where You Come From. Trump Still Does.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/opinion/immigration-coronavirus-border.html,"The immigration system along the southern border is overtaxed, and detention centers across the United States are already bursting with nearly 40,000 people, at enormous risk of contagion. The coronavirus doesn't discriminate between carriers who are held behind bars and those whose job it is to guard them. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has continued to make arrests and has shown no intention of releasing nonviolent detainees, though judges in some states have ordered some released out of health concerns.

Rounding up undocumented immigrants and shutting down the border is something President Trump has yearned to do since long before the coronavirus began its fateful spread. And his animosity toward undocumented immigrants is affecting the efforts to contain the coronavirus far beyond the border.

As Miriam Jordan of The Times reported, the virus has spread more fear among immigrants, legal and undocumented -- the fear that seeking medical or financial help will put them in the cross-hairs of the administration's repressive immigration policies.

At the beginning of March, more than 700 public health and legal experts addressed a petition to Vice President Mike Pence and other federal, state and local leaders asking, among other things, that medical facilities be declared enforcement-free zones (ICE currently classifies them as ""sensitive locations,"" where enforcement is avoided but not precluded). The Citizenship and Immigration Service subsequently appeared to signal that it was suspending enforcement of a new ""public charge"" rule, which makes it harder for immigrants to obtain the green card of a permanent resident if they tap federal benefits, but the suspension has not been publicized.

Those who are not documented are afraid that going to a public health facility will expose them to ICE agents. Immigrants in the country legally and hoping to obtain a green card fear that seeking help will ruin their chances under the public charge rule, which went into effect in February after injunctions blocking it were lifted by the Supreme Court.",Hostility toward immigrants is hurting the fight against the pandemic.,0522a94c-e865-5845-b620-98c3c986849c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/20/opinion/20immigration_editorial_illustratioon/20immigration_editorial_illustratioon-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=441acc4cb9868ff47c51253bfbba167da854763f0db0af44e3e45255f2b66859&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,,0522a94c-e865-5845-b620-98c3c986849c,N24News/imgs/0522a94c-e865-5845-b620-98c3c986849c.jpg,11

Fashion & Style,Zayn Malik and Donatella Versace: Fashion's Newest Couple,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/fashion/zayn-malik-donatella-versace-versus.html,"Donatella Versace has found her new Anthony Vaccarello -- which is to say, her new designer for Versus Versace, the younger, hipper Versace sibling line that has been without a creative director since Mr. Vaccarello resigned to take the top job at Yves Saint Laurent this year. Except her new designer is not, actually, a designer. He is a 23-year-old R&B singer with a bad boy reputation, a former member of one of the biggest pop bands of the 21st century, a social media magnet with more than 35 million followers on Twitter and Instagram combined and the boyfriend of a very famous model, Gigi Hadid. ""Versus is the rock and roll soul of the Versace family and has always been associated with music,"" Ms. Versace said during an interview backstage after the recent Versus Versace show during London Fashion Week. ""Everyone from the Foo Fighters to Lenny Kravitz has played at the shows, and it is all about rebellion. For me, Zayn was the perfect fit."" Ms. Versace added that she first met Mr. Malik alongside his former One Direction bandmate, Harry Styles, several years ago and that his quiet, mysterious demeanor had immediately intrigued her.

""That said, I was not exactly a fan of that band,"" she continued, wrinkling her nose in disdain. ""But then I met him again when he started to date Gigi, who I work with all the time. And he impressed me very much -- he was so mature, so thoughtful, treated her like such a gentleman. They are very nice young people, a lovely couple, in fact. And then he told me how much he loved fashion. It was then I knew he was the right face for what I had in mind. ""Many celebrities do clothing lines that just aren't relevant,"" Ms. Versace said with a grin. ""This one? It will be. He's smart to do it with me.""

Together Ms. Versace and Mr. Malik will design Zayn X Versus, a capsule collection of men's and women's clothing that will be presented to buyers and the media in the spring and then, in May, will be available in Versus stores and online. Mr. Malik, who wore a Versace robotlike arm sheath to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute ball in May and introduced a 23-piece streetwear line under his own name earlier this year, will also become the face of Versus in advertising campaigns. Not that Mr. Malik was anywhere to be seen when reporters, including this one, tried to talk to him about the project after the brand's show during London Fashion Week last month. Mr. Malik, who had spent the evening in the front row holding hands with Ms. Hadid, had been scheduled for a batch of top-secret interviews, once the crowds melted away. But he, too, vanished, without warning nor a clue to his whereabouts, sending a small army of sleek black-clad publicists into a panicked tailspin.

Ms. Versace, for her part, seemed nonplused as she sipped a mineral water backstage and greeted well-wishers, though the no-show was in keeping with the vision she has always had for her younger, more streetwise fashion brand. ""Versus is everything that the Versace line is not. It is loud, it is rebellious -- I don't want shoppers buying both from Versus and Versace. The houses have different souls,"" Ms. Versace said. ""I wanted Zayn because he can help me talk to his followers. I want to listen to their language. I want to learn more about them, what they think and what they like. They are a new generation that without working with someone like Zayn, I will never reach."" For his part, the elusive Mr. Malik agreed, at least via an email earlier this week. ""I think Versus has always been a very cool brand and is a great brand for me and for people in my generation,"" Mr. Malik wrote. ""I've always wanted to design clothes and there's no brand I'd rather design for than Versus. I like to learn about things I'm interested in and I enjoy being around creative people so I think it will be cool. The bonus is that I get to collaborate with Donatella, whom I love and admire. I know we'll create something amazing."" In the difficult trading climate that many luxury brands have been facing recently, Versus Versace has proved a resilient performer; in the 12 months to March this year, the group announced that retail revenue from sales of the secondary line had doubled, just as it had the period before. Clearly Ms. Versace, whose daughter, Allegra, also works on the Versus brand, has her eyes on further growth -- fueled by the millennial consumer. ""This isn't just a breathing season -- this is the beginning of a whole new era for Versus,"" she said, adding that a percentage of the proceeds generated by the partnership with Mr. Malik would be donated to charity. ""Zayn is clearly our plan for now. But I think going forward I will keep doing collaborations with other musicians and rock stars as guest designers. It will be like our version of taking the brand on tour.""",The singer and the designer team up on Versus Versace. The target?

Music,'The Drama is Over' at the Salzburg Easter Festival,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/arts/music/salzburg-easter-festival-bachler-thielemann.html,"""The drama is over,"" Mr. Bachler said in a telephone interview.

Mr. Bachler said that he planned to reinvent the festival, which was originally conceived as a vehicle for the Berlin Philharmonic, and more recently served as one for the Staatskapelle. His idea is to bring different leading orchestras and conductors each year to explore repertoire in which they specialize. Mr. Bachler also plans to reconfigure the 10-day event to make it more immersive, with offerings from morning until late at night.

In his letter to festival officials, Mr. Thielemann, who is also the music director of the Bayreuth Wagner Festival, wrote that he had hoped to conduct Wagner's ""Lohengrin"" in Salzburg in 2022, and Strauss's ""Elektra"" there in 2023. The festival officials split the difference, announcing that Mr. Thielemann would conduct ""Lohengrin"" as his farewell in 2022. (A spokeswoman for the Staatskapelle said that neither the orchestra nor Mr. Thielemann had any comment.)

Mr. Bachler will take over the festival's business operations in 2020 -- when he will overlap with Mr. Thielemann -- and become artistic director in 2022. He has a close rapport with the conductor Kirill Petrenko, the music director of the Bavarian State Opera, who became chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic last month. He said that he hoped to lure the Berliners -- who have played at Baden-Baden's Easter Festival since leaving Salzburg -- back, as one of the rotating guest orchestras he hopes to attract.","Nikolaus Bachler will take over the annual event, and Christian Thielemann and his Staatskapelle Dresden will move on after 2022.",b8c67e1c-1f58-5fd5-88d5-75febe2b76ec,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/17/arts/17festival-item1/17festival-item1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=d06aa4106e06a1b36bcb763ed4a6f89b6bfa01c9c7cdbbccab7f545cf7a837d9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Nikolaus Bachler will become artistic director of the Salzburg Easter Festival in 2022, after a tense battle with the current director, the conductor Christian Thielemann.",b8c67e1c-1f58-5fd5-88d5-75febe2b76ec,N24News/imgs/b8c67e1c-1f58-5fd5-88d5-75febe2b76ec.jpg,12
Books,"A Youthful, Lovesick Journey Revealed in a Sketchbook",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/06/books/review/craig-thompson-carnet-de-voyage.html,"Back in 2004, Craig Thompson was coming into his own as a serious graphic novelist. His intimate ""Blankets"" -- an autobiographical tale of first love, brotherly failure and lost faith -- had won a number of awards, and his success was helping to move the graphic memoir into the American mainstream. He was also, though, slightly adrift: His girlfriend had just left him, and he wanted to get out of Portland, Ore., which was full of memories of her.

Thompson's French publisher organized a book tour, and when other publishers in other countries piled on, the trip turned into an odyssey. To stay productive and to connect to a tradition popular with other artists, Thompson committed to recording a travel diary -- or ""Carnet de Voyage"" -- as he went, sketching every day. The result is a swiftly compiled record of his travels in Europe and Morocco (where he researched his long-gestating graphic novel ""Habibi""). The sketchbook-cum-travelogue is quite a dreamy object -- it doesn't use many separated panels, and drawing often fills the page, black crosshatched edges feathering and dissolving into the ragged white surround. Like others of its type, the book encourages the eye and mind to wander. This is travel in its exploded view. Close-ups of French friends jostle alongside wide-screen landscapes; little notes and arrows carry us along Thompson's stream-of-consciousness; there's a page on how to wind a turban, complete with steps.

Thompson's other work can be overwrought; ""Habibi,"" for instance, is a claustrophobic experience, with self-consciously exquisite decoration and Orientalist fantasy crowding the pages, like vines grown too big in the hothouse. ""Carnet de Voyage,"" though, was made at such incredible speed -- it was already at the publisher while he was still touring -- that it corrects for some of that laboriousness. Thompson's drawings are still lush and considered, flowing across the pages from his Pentel brush-pen, but the book is looser, sweeter, more suggestive than his other pieces. Yet it's not all sweet. He often hates the trip: He's torn about his exchanges with people in Morocco, especially when they demand money from him or he's made to realize that they consider his portraiture intrusive. It's clear that his subjects believe that allowing him to draw them entitles them to something -- and this leaves Thompson deeply uncomfortable.","Craig Thompson's ""Carnet de Voyage"" is a reissued version of his travel sketchbook as the author of ""Blankets"" made his way through Europe and Morocco.",99a0185c-4712-5d19-8501-ec3e6854f78d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/08/books/review/08Shaw/08Shaw-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=eced54acf7ce7ffe61bbd5b1f80bbf58ad43dcbe40eaac0cde8061fc72f4ad75&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A panel from ""Carnet de Voyage.""",99a0185c-4712-5d19-8501-ec3e6854f78d,N24News/imgs/99a0185c-4712-5d19-8501-ec3e6854f78d.jpg,13
Style,Burt Reynolds Changed the Gaze,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/style/burt-reynolds-dead-cosmopolitan.html,"Back in the sexual Stone Age, it was assumed that straight men were so genetically overheated that Mother Nature hard-wired them to gawp at images of bare-naked ladies. Women, on the other hand, were her empathic creations: nurturing, maternal, their libidinal thermostats permanently set to low cool. If a hunk of man-flesh suddenly came into view, a woman's gaze was expected to rest some place well north of the belt buckle. What a woman was considered to want most from a man -- in ancient times before Tinder and rampant sexting -- was to gaze soulfully into his eyes. Burt Reynolds changed all that with one hairy-chested centerfold. And while there is little doubt that the actor, who died Thursday at the age of 82, earned himself a fixed place in the entertainment firmament with a long career that -- begun in television's early days -- brought him mainstream success as a half-Comanche blacksmith on the series ""Gunsmoke"" and later as the title character on the clunky police drama ""Dan August""; acting cred for his breakout role in the 1972 film ""Deliverance""; and an Oscar nomination for his turn in Paul Thomas Anderson's 1997 ""Boogie Nights,"" it was with his 1972 striptease for Cosmopolitan that he effected true cultural change.

It seems unimaginable now that Reynolds was making a radical break with Hollywood taboos about male nudity, let alone full-frontal, by agreeing to appear in the altogether for a mainstream publication now that every actor from Jason Segel to Daniel Radcliffe has shown us his junk. Yet in consenting to the Cosmo editor Helen Gurley Brown's proposition (she made it to him while he was sitting in for Johnny Carson as host of the ""Tonight"" show) that he become the first male centerfold, Reynolds was not only helping to propel us into a new era in women's magazine publishing but also a refreshed understanding of what women desire.

Brown herself said so. ""At the time, you know, men liked to look at women naked,"" she once told James Landers, the author of a book on the first 100 years of Cosmopolitan magazine ""Well, nobody talked about it, but women liked to look at men naked. I did."" Reynolds was not Brown's first choice; Paul Newman had already turned her down. And what is interesting to contemplate is how things might have turned out had it been Newman who chose to present his undressed physique and not Reynolds -- Newman's lean boyish body a precursor of the glorified hairless male and Reynolds's furry one a relaxed emblem of an era of key parties, swingers, and also the hirsute and mustachioed gay clone. Three decades on, in 2002, the designer Tom Ford would make a knowing nod to that early Cosmo centerfold when creating a black and white Yves Saint Laurent fragrance advertising campaign that featured the martial arts champion Samuel de Cubber naked and ostentatiously unwaxed. ""I wanted to show a man who represents a natural and relaxed image of male beauty,"" Mr. Ford said at the time. The lineage of that provocative pictorial can be traced directly to Burt Reynolds, forearm angled coyly over his genitals as he posed Odalisque-style atop a fur rug. So too, in a sense, can every self-conscious nude ever snapped in a bathroom mirror.

The ease men now feel about showing their all, and the expectation that women are empowered to have a good look at it, has a distinct point of origin and it is Burt Reynolds. ""I didn't know there was going to be a commotion about it,"" the actor, as dryly humorous as ever, told the talk show host Steve Harvey in his final televised interview last March. ""It wasn't a big deal to me,"" Mr. Reynolds said. ""I said, 'I'll do it, but I'll have my hands in front of me. And I have very small hands, actually.""",The nude heard around the world.,0db0d5ee-34b1-5291-97d8-a256226e49ac,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/07/autossell/07reynolds-style/07reynolds-style-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=ce486b5d5c40a91c7f0352f1899b6844ec56ee6281c8d1243db2b100e615de93&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,That chest hair.,0db0d5ee-34b1-5291-97d8-a256226e49ac,N24News/imgs/0db0d5ee-34b1-5291-97d8-a256226e49ac.jpg,15
Real Estate,New Robert A.M. Stern Condo on Park Avenue Sells for Nearly $74 Million,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/realestate/new-robert-am-stern-condo-on-park-avenue-sells-for-nearly-74-million.html,"New Robert A.M. Stern Condo on Park Avenue Sells for Nearly $74 Million

The newly opened towers at 520 Park Avenue and 220 Central Park South, each designed with stately limestone facades by Robert A.M. Stern Architects, are steadily filling up. Several luxury residences officially closed at 520 Park in November, including the most expensive sale in New York City this year: a duplex penthouse selling for $73.8 million, according to property records. The other big sales at the building were another penthouse duplex that sold for $62 million, as well as apartments on the 30th floor selling at $25.86 million, the 24th floor at $23 million, and the 23rd floor at $20.01 million. The 54-story condominium, at Park Avenue and East 60th Street, began its closings in September; many more units are under contract. At 220 Central Park South, a few blocks away at West 58th Street, a 27th-floor condo sold for $13.49 million. Closings there commenced in October, and they are ultimately expected to include the city's priciest listing: a $250 million penthouse with 23,000 square feet.

Several other notable transactions took place in the month of November. Keith Richards, the Rolling Stones guitarist, finally sold his Greenwich Village duplex penthouse, while Paul Waaktaar-Savoy, a guitarist in the Norwegian pop band A-ha, parted with his SoHo home. The closing price for each was $9 million. Adriana Lima, the Brazilian model and actress, sold her Midtown apartment. Louise McNamee, the first woman named a partner in a major advertising agency, sold the Greenwich Village townhouse she owned with her husband, Peter McHugh, who briefly ran Pan American World Airways after its bankruptcy. And the billionaire hedge-fund manager William A. Ackman, a major player in Manhattan's luxury market, continued to replenish his real estate holdings after deeding several properties to his former wife in an apparent property settlement. He bought a compound of four penthouses at an Upper West Side co-op building. The two penthouses that sold at 520 Park, units PH60 and PH52, each have 9,138 square feet of interior space, with six bedrooms and seven and a half baths, according to the offering plan. They also have high ceilings, white-oak floors, a private elevator bank, and 279 square feet of outdoor space with panoramic cityscape and Central Park views. The buyer of PH60 was James Dyson, the billionaire founder of the British home electronics maker Dyson, which has a new flagship store in Manhattan just a few blocks away on Fifth Avenue. Mr. Dyson made his purchase using a limited liability company; the other purchases were also through a limited liability partnership or company. The three smaller apartments at 520 Park were similarly configured on a full floor. Each has 4,628 square feet of space, with four bedrooms and five baths, as well as a spacious living room, formal dining room and family room. These units also have park and city views.

The condominium offers its residents numerous amenities, among them: a landscaped private garden; a club room and playroom; a fitness center with a pool, sauna and steam room; and a wine cellar. The building was developed by Zeckendorf Development, in partnership with Park Sixty and Global Holdings. At 220 Central Park South, the buyer for the 27th-floor condo was listed as Tong Tong Zhao, a founder of the China Lodging Group, a hotel management company now known as the Huazhu Hotels Group and based in Shanghai, China. Ms. Zhao's new apartment has 2,394 square feet, with two bedrooms and two and a half baths. The building was developed by Vornado Realty Trust.

Mr. Richards and his wife, Patti Hansen, a model and actress, sold their penthouse at the co-op building at 1 Fifth Avenue, near Eighth Street and Washington Square Park, for a $1.5 million loss. The couple had purchased the four-bedroom, four-bath apartment in 2014 for $10.5 million, and about two years later put it back on the market for $12.3 million. The most recent asking price was reduced to nearly $10 million. The sprawling duplex has three terraces on the lower level, which contains a living room, dining area, kitchen and two bedrooms, according to the listing with Douglas Elliman Real Estate. A family room and two additional bedrooms are upstairs.

The SoHo apartment sold by Mr. Waaktaar-Savoy and his wife Lauren Savoy, a music composer and director, was unit No. 5 South at 42 Wooster Street, a prewar condominium between Grand and Broome Streets. The unit has four bedrooms and four and a half baths over nearly 4,500 square feet. Ms. Lima, the model best known for her work with Victoria's Secret and Maybelline cosmetics, sold No. 42D at 146 West 57th Street, a.k.a the Metropolitan Tower Condominium, for $3.3 million. She paid nearly $2 million for the apartment in 2003, and first listed it in late 2016 for $4.85 million. The 2,200-square-foot residence has three bedrooms and two and a half baths, along with Central Park and city views, according to the listing with Douglas Elliman.

In the Village, Ms. McNamee and Mr. McHugh, who now live in Charlottesville, Va., sold 11 Leroy Street. This former carriage house between Bleecker Street and Seventh Avenue South is 25 feet wide and three stories high, with a garage on the ground level, a terrace on the roof and a wine cellar in the basement. The sale price was $11.25 million. The 4,880-square-foot home has five bedrooms and three and a half baths. The exterior space is about 1,000 square feet. Ms. McNamee spent several decades in the advertising business, including her role as partner at the firm of Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer. Mr. Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square Capital Management, bought four adjacent penthouses on the 16th and 17th floors of the grand co-op building at 6-16 West 77th Street. The units, which he is expected to combine, ranged from a studio to a duplex, according to the listing with Brown Harris Stevens, and include about 3,200 square feet of terraces.

The compound had been owned by Nancy Friday, an author known for her best-selling books about gender politics. She died a year ago, and the property was sold through a revocable trust. All the proceeds from the sale are expected to go to charitable foundations to benefit emerging writers and animals. The total sale price for the four apartments was $22 million, according to property records. The prewar, 15-story, beige-brick building is on Central Park West, near the American Museum of Natural History. Mr. Ackman has been active in the market of late. In October, he transferred a duplex at 420 West Broadway in SoHo to his former wife, Karen Ackman, a landscape architect and artist whom he divorced last year. The month before, he deeded to Ms. Ackman another duplex in the Beresford, at 211 Central Park West, between 81st and 82nd Streets. He also purchased for himself two units on the eighth floor of the Beresford. Also last month: The city's second-biggest sale, at $27.5 million, was a 68th-floor apartment at 432 Park Avenue, the 96-story skyscraper between 56th and 57th Streets, on Midtown Manhattan's Billionaires' Row. The 4,019-square-foot unit, No. 68B, has four bedrooms and four and a half baths, along with panoramic views of the city and beyond, according to the listing with Compass. It also comes with a 342-square-foot studio for staff, No. 28L, and a 1,764-bottle wine cellar. This property was initially put on the market in July 2017 for $30.9 million.",A duplex at 520 Park Avenue was the top sale in November. Other notable sales include apartments owned by the Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards and the A-ha guitarist Paul Waaktaar-Savoy.,f93f3d52-2dc7-5288-8ae3-35b53db3a3d7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/02/realestate/02ticket1/02ticket1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=a1ba2304de352707cdf557c80cced2994ed9ef9def1b8d5028ef850dd7d32c1f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A new Robert A.M.

Dance,"Review: Becoming Kazuo Ohno, a Bold Copycat Tribute to a Butoh Master",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/20/arts/dance/review-becoming-kazuo-ohno-a-bold-copycat-tribute-to-a-butoh-master.html,"As audience members arrived at Japan Society on Friday night, the performer Takao Kawaguchi was already in motion, sliding down banisters, wrestling with a garden hose and otherwise making mischief in the theater lobby. Looking on from one wall was a portrait of his muse: Kazuo Ohno, the great Butoh dancer and a founder of that postwar Japanese dance-theater form, who died in 2010 at 103.

The cacophonous scene introduced ""About Kazuo Ohno -- Reliving the Butoh Diva's Masterpieces,"" Mr. Kawaguchi's attempt, as he has put it, to ""become Kazuo Ohno."" His approach: to reproduce, gesture for gesture, expression for expression, several of the master's performances as captured on video.

Mr. Kawaguchi, who never saw Mr. Ohno perform live, has acknowledged the boldness of this method, calling it ""the heretical act of copying."" In an improvisatory form concerned with conjuring inner worlds -- the source of often grotesque, unsettling movement -- surfaces are a controversial starting point.","The performer Takao Kawaguchi reproduced, gesture for gesture, expression for expression, several Ohno dance-theater performances in a show at Japan Society.",a7fbba13-0bbf-5053-8ed3-adc13a18d817,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/20/arts/20OHNO1/20OHNO1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=5f7a820973d06841d8bad73a76efa5d4b23896a646227589dd9c24667375eb6a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Takao Kawaguchi in ""About Kazuo Ohno – Reliving The Butoh Diva's Masterpieces,"" at Japan Society.",a7fbba13-0bbf-5053-8ed3-adc13a18d817,N24News/imgs/a7fbba13-0bbf-5053-8ed3-adc13a18d817.jpg,6
Music,"Stevie Wonder Demands Justice, and 12 More New Songs",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/arts/music/playlist-stevie-wonder-demi-lovato.html,"Stevie Wonder has lost patience with the lack of progress toward racial justice in America, and ""Can't Put It in the Hands of Fate"" brings new specifics to the sentiments he sang about in ""You Haven't Done Nothin'"" back in 1974. ""You say you're sick and tired of us protesting/I say, not tired enough to make a change,"" Wonder sings. ""You say just to hold on/I say no way."" Soon afterward, he lets loose a profanity. The beat is go-go, the tenacious, percussion-happy style from Washington, D.C., while Wonder's perpetual tunefulness comes through in a jaunty harmonica lick and ever-climbing melodies. But he puts rappers upfront before he sings his first verse, and he fades out the song with a righteous chant: ""Ain't nobody got time to wait."" JON PARELES

It's eerie to hear David Bowie singing ""We can rise up from this grave"" in ""American Landfill,"" which arrives suddenly on ""The Turning: Kate's Diary,"" a spinoff EP from the soundtrack to ""The Turning."" Bowie's voice and imprint are heard throughout the song, which is a ferocious reworking of Kristeen Young's ""Saviour,"" a duet with Bowie that she wrote and originally released in 2004 on her album, ""Breasticles,"" made with Bowie's longtime producer, Tony Visconti. Radically reshaped now by Young and the producer Justin Raisen, it veers from jagged, dissonant verses -- with electronic percussion and Young's own dissonant piano -- to heroic, glam-anthem choruses and a lofty, string-backed near-finale that comes crashing back down at the end. She's less hopeful than ever that ""You could be my saviour."" PARELES

In July 2016, Demi Lovato sang her brassy anthem ""Confident"" -- a playlist staple at many a Hillary Clinton event, and a superior alternative to Rachel Platten's ""Fight Song"" -- on the opening night of the Democratic National Convention. Four years later, on the cusp of another election, Lovato has released a much more somber song for the occasion: the protest piano ballad ""Commander in Chief,"" which she debuted on Wednesday night during a performance at the Billboard Music Awards. Though she never mentions him by name, the song -- with sparse production from Billie Eilish's brother, Finneas -- is a direct address to President Trump, delivered in a voice both quavering and undaunted. The song's best moment is its sickest burn: ""Won't give up, stand our ground,"" Lovato sings, ""we'll be in the streets while you're bunkering down."" ZOLADZ Lana Del Rey, 'Let Me Love You Like a Woman'

Though Lana Del Rey has teased her forthcoming album, ""Chemtrails Over the Country Club,"" as an aesthetic departure -- ""it was like, 'Is this the new folk? Oh, God, are we going country?'"" she recently mused in Interview -- the first song she's released from it, ""Let Me Love You Like a Woman,"" is standard Lana fare. The piano-driven arrangement is muted and sparse, placing all the emphasis on Del Rey's breathy, crooning romanticism (""Let me hold you like a baby"") and casual mass-cultural references (""Let me shine like a diamond,"" ""We could get lost in the purple rain."") Perhaps, though, ""Let Me Love You Like a Woman"" is just the point of departure for ""Chemtrails,"" which she's described as ""Midwestern-sounding""; as she beckons in the verse, ""I'm ready to leave L.A. and I want you to come."" ZOLADZ

The rotating South African musical collective Spaza released its debut album last year, a misty concoction of rhythms, textures and voices that flowed through the ears like a sage brush hits the nose. The group is back with its second album, ""Uprize!,"" which it originally recorded as the soundtrack to a documentary on the 1976 student uprisings, by improvising along to the film's rough cut. Spaza's lineup here is different from the first album; this time the simmering voice of Nonku Phiri figures prominently, casually sliding into the center of the sound. It coexists there with the spoken testimonials of figures heard in the film, discussing the protests and the greater Black consciousness movement. On tracks like ""Sizwile,"" Phiri is bearing witness, singing underneath the elders' voices rather than on top, fortifying their memory. RUSSONELLO

""Everybody knows my past now, like my house was always made of glass,"" Justin Bieber sings on a raw, aching new song with the producer Benny Blanco, ""Maybe that's the price you pay for the money and fame at an early age."" Though Bieber's spoken plenty about the toll his childhood stardom took on his mental health (most recently in the YouTube series ""Justin Bieber: Seasons""), he's never sung about it quite as candidly as he does here. ""I'm so lonely,"" he sings on the chorus, stretching that last word out into a broken yodel that conjures young Mason Ramsey in the aisles of Walmart. It's a particularly loaded word for Bieber, though, given that one of his earliest hits -- from the purple-hoodie era that the actor Jacob Tremblay so eerily conjures in the music video -- promised ""One Less Lonely Girl."" ZOLADZ

Shortly before releasing his new album, ""Molecular,"" the tenor saxophonist James Brandon Lewis put out two pieces of writing outlining a new artistic framework, called Molecular Systematic Music. The essays spill with savory ideas, but the big one seems to be that a musician should be trying to understand how their mind, body and environment give them a personal way of hearing the world -- which replicates itself through the way they play, like musical DNA. There's a counterintuitive pleasure to this: that the biggest and richest mystery is yourself, and that you're the one who must crack that code. It feels apt coming from Lewis, whose saxophone playing has always sounded like a person trying to wrap his arms around a thunderstorm, as if he's overwhelmed by the amount he has to say. On ""Helix"" his expert quartet -- Aruan Ortiz on piano, Brad Jones on bass and Chad Taylor on drums -- helps him turn those ideas into action.

Real Estate,House Hunting in … Singapore,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/realestate/house-hunting-in-singapore.html,"This four-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bath condominium is on the 30th floor of the Concourse Skyline, a multi-tower, mixed-use development on Singapore's southeastern waterfront. The 2,174-square-foot apartment overlooks many of the city-nation's signature attractions, including the Singapore Flyer Ferris wheel, the Singapore Sports Hub and the Gardens by the Bay. Completed in 2014 in Singapore's District 7 -- an area now being revitalized, with prewar buildings being renovated or replaced by new developments -- the Concourse Skyline is close to museums, restaurants, schools and the island's business district. ""It's quite a nice area, a mix of old and new,"" said Huan Mei Han, the head of research for List Sotheby's International Realty Singapore, which has the listing.

The apartment is divided into three spaces, with two bedrooms at one end, common spaces in the center and two bedrooms on the opposite side. The open living and dining rooms have marble tile floors and a wall of glass with sliding doors that open to a spacious balcony overlooking Marina Bay. The kitchen, with off-white counters and De Dietrich appliances, is off the dining room, along with an adjacent half-bath. The Concourse Skyline development, completed in 2014, has 360 units, including six penthouses. Down a small hallway past the kitchen, two bedrooms have large windows. One has a walk-in closet and an en suite bathroom with panoramic views of a different swath of the city. The other bedroom uses a hall bathroom. A small hallway leads to the other living area, with a smaller bedroom, bathroom and study, as well as the master suite with an adjacent study. The development has 360 units, including six penthouses. The development's amenities include a 164-foot pool, a Jacuzzi, wellness facilities, meditation deck and sauna, green open spaces with barbecue grills, and a pond on one of the rooftops. The development also has a covered bridge to the Nicoll Highway Mass Rapid Transportation station. Singapore Changi airport is about 25 minutes by car. The sovereign city-nation of Singapore has a highly diverse population of about 5.6 million residents and one of the world's highest rates of homeownership, due largely to a robust public-housing program that allows residents to own homes subsidized by the government. Historically, government steering has kept the housing market stable, said Ismail Gafoor, the chief executive of PropNex Realty, Singapore's largest private real estate company. Following the global financial crisis of 2008, for example, prices dropped by about 30 to 40 percent before rebounding within a year, Mr. Gafoor said, after the government boosted demand for housing by incentivizing immigration for skilled workers. Singapore's population grew from roughly 4.2 million in 2005 to 5.5 million in 2015.

An increase in the supply of public housing has also resulted in falling prices in that market. In the private sector, prices have been rising. Only about 15 to 20 percent of Singapore's housing stock is private, said Kent Soo, an agent with Real Center International Private Limited, a Singapore agency. Mr. Soo said private-sector prices have been rising since 2017, when many buyers who had been waiting to react to government measures implemented in 2013 -- including a mandated reduction in debt -- decided to enter the market.

In 2018, the market cooled when the government raised the rate of stamp duties that most foreigners, and in some cases locals, pay on residential real estate. (Buyers from the U.S. and several other nations were exempted.) The private housing market in Singapore is now characterized by two trends: reduced volume, due in part to government efforts to maintain sustainable price growth, and a slight rise in prices caused by an uptick in big-ticket luxury transactions. Ms. Han said several new superluxury penthouses sold this year, raising the property price index. Geographically, Singapore's property market is divided into three general regions: the Core Central Region, which has the highest caliber and highest priced properties; the Rest Of Central region, which surrounds the core; and the Outside Central Region, where prices are typically lower. Agents also mentioned Sentosa, a neighboring island with luxury properties, where foreigners can buy landed properties without restrictions. However, Mr. Soo said Sentosa has been struggling to attract buyers, and prices have fallen there because people tend to prefer the Core Central Region. In the Core Central Region, a two-bedroom, 1,000-square-foot apartment might cost 3 million to 3.5 million Singapore dollars ($2.2 million to $2.5 million), while in the Outside Central Region, prices for a similar two-bedroom typically range between 1 million to 1.5 million Singapore dollars ($725,000 to $1.1 million), Mr. Gafoor said. Ms. Han said that newer luxury condominiums start at 5 million Singapore dollars ($3.6 million), or around 3,000 Singapore dollars ($2,200) per square foot.

Ms. Han said that based on government statistics, about 20 percent of the buyers of residential properties in the Core Central Region are foreign. About 65 percent of the buyers of that area's luxury offerings are legal permanent residents of Singapore from other countries. As part of its effort to regulate the real estate market, and because of its small surface area, Singapore imposes certain restrictions on foreign buyers. For private residences, ""Foreigners are permitted to purchase an apartment or condominium units in and around the city, or apartments and houses at Sentosa Cove. For other properties, for example detached houses, foreigners need to first obtain approval from the Land Dealings Approval Unit before making their purchase,"" said Peen Fung Lim, a director of Yuen Law LLC, a Singapore law firm, via email. The process typically takes between several weeks and several months, he said. Denny Lin, the legal general manager with Apex Law, a Singapore firm, said being a permanent resident and making an economic contribution to Singapore can help one's chances of approval, which is administered on a ""case by case"" basis. There are two modes of owning residential property in Singapore: Some homes are purchased in perpetuity, with a freehold title. The other option is leasehold, whereby properties are typically leased for either 99 or 999 years.

Style,New York Nightlife Goes Online,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/style/new-york-nightlife-goes-online-coronavirus.html,"A DJ known as Physical Therapy live-streamed a virtual party last Saturday for Nowadays, a club in the Ridgewood section of Queens.





Last Saturday night, when all of New York City's bars and clubs were closed, a DJ known as Physical Therapy set up a turntable, mixer and webcam in his walk-up apartment in the Ridgewood section of Queens. Wearing a Hawaiian T-shirt and track pants, and standing in his cramped bedroom stuffed with records and sneakers, he live-streamed a two-hour set of house music and booty bass tracks to about 11,000 virtual clubgoers, some likely wearing pajamas at home. Though the new coronavirus has halted the city's nightlife, club owners and D.J.s have shown a lot of ingenuity in coping and collaborating. Some clubs are hosting live D.J. sets on Instagram and Facebook. Piano bars are live streaming their favorite singers. Party promoters are hosting Zoom dance parties and playing sets for friends and family over Twitch. And out-of-work D.J.s are enlisting social media to communicate with their fans and generate income.

Justin Carter and Eamon Harkin, the owners of Nowadays, sprang into action on March 12, when President Trump banned travel from Europe. They teamed up with Francois Vaxelaire, the owner of the Lot Radio to create Virtually Nowadays, which has been streaming D.J. sets every night from 8 p.m. to midnight. The show takes place in different apartments and is free, though fans can support the D.J.s through Patreon starting at $5 a month. ""Just because Nowadays has shut down doesn't mean they don't exist anymore,"" Mr. Vaxelaire said. Other clubs have joined the live-streaming party. Kae Burke and Anya Sapozhnikova, the founders of House of Yes, a performance club in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, hosted a virtual dance party last Saturday night on Zoom, the video chat app. In keeping with the club's vibe, festive costumes were required and attendance was capped at 100. ""It was surprisingly uplifting and emotional,"" Ms. Burke said. ""We will be doing it again this Saturday.""

Homebound D.J.s are also hosting virtual house parties. Amber Valentine, a D.J. at the Woods, an outdoorsy bar in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, turned her tidy white apartment into a '70s disco pad last Sunday, with red paper lanterns and multicolored lights, and played obscure disco and funk from 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. Like any good hostess, she wore a sparkly off-the shoulder dress and greeted people by name as they joined the party on Instagram Live. Her guests responded in kind. ""Best Sunday night ever,"" wrote Masami Hosono, a creative director at a gender-neutral hair salon in the East Village. Folding laundry and ""booty grooving,"" said another user, named Bevin.

Others have sought refuge in show tunes. Marie's Crisis, the beloved piano bar in Greenwich Village, opened its private Facebook group so anyone can listen to its favorite performers belt out Sondheim classics. The group has added more than 10,000 members since last week. Some nightlife veterans have decided that this is the moment to do a little housekeeping and release archives as a way to make money. The CarryNation, a D.J. duo in New York that hosts queer dance parties, created a Patreon page and is charging $10 a month for access to their previously unreleased live recordings and house remixes.

Underlying this creative burst is the troubling reality that much of the city's nightlife community will be without a steady stream of income for the foreseeable future. Last week, the New York City Office of Nightlife posted an online survey for nightlife workers to assess the economic effect of the coronavirus pandemic. It has received more than 10,000 responses (the survey closes on March 27). The situation is particularly dire for the part-time workers who live paycheck to paycheck. Some bars and clubs are trying to help. Nowadays set up a Venmo account for its staff and has raised $22,000. House of Yes has raised $29,907 on GoFundMe. And a new party called Social Disdance, which takes place exclusively on Zoom, encourages fans to send money to its D.J.s and coronavirus-related charities. DJ AvJo, who played for one hour on Zoom last Friday night, said he made $300, about the same amount he got from traditional four-hour gigs. ""Plus, I usually have to take a cab to the location there and back,"" he said. ""It was so uplifting. It really felt like we are all in this together.""","Clubs like Nowadays, House of Yes and Marie's Crisis are live-streaming D.J. sets and singalongs.",c2f8a1b8-7bb2-598e-9a4c-ef4c86a79c7a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/26/fashion/VIRUS-CLUBS-hppromo/VIRUS-CLUBS-02-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=b8b1c873861d42b66a98c1831d3ad0649dfda099c1956d0c97f7236ebf0df91d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A screen shot from a new party called Social Disdance, which takes place on Zoom.",c2f8a1b8-7bb2-598e-9a4c-ef4c86a79c7a,N24News/imgs/c2f8a1b8-7bb2-598e-9a4c-ef4c86a79c7a.jpg,15
Opinion,Reform the Police? Guess Who Funds My State's Officials,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/09/opinion/sunday/police-reform-defund-politicians.html,"LOS ANGELES -- In late August, Los Angeles sheriff's deputies shot a Black man, Dijon Kizzee, whom they had stopped for a suspected traffic violation as he rode his bicycle. He became the seventh man killed by deputies in Los Angeles since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on Memorial Day weekend. On the same afternoon, state legislators in Sacramento raced to the end of their 2020 session. The most significant police reform measure, heralded in the days of the Black Lives Matter marches that filled the streets, did not even come up for a vote. A centerpiece of the agenda would have set up a process for yanking the badge of any officer found to have committed serious misconduct. California is one of only five states that has no process for decertifying police officers, which among other things enables bad cops to move from department to department with impunity. Democrats hold supermajorities in both houses. Major newspapers in California editorialized in favor of a slew of police reform bills. Polls showed support. In one of the bluest states in the country, all indications pointed toward action on reform.

But in the end, even here, it was essentially business as usual in a State Capitol where police unions have long wielded enormous power. The measures that passed this year were either noncontroversial or so diluted as to have little if any immediate impact. ""The culture has not even begun to change,"" said John Crew, a retired attorney who spent decades working on police accountability issues in California for the A.C.L.U. ""Their political analysis seems to be that the world has not changed as much as a lot of us think it has. I hope it has."" If the marches that brought so much hope for profound change are to translate into laws, hope will have to overcome fear: The movement will have to exert enough pressure to overcome politicians' fear of crossing the unions. The culture will not change until enough elected officials are unafraid to risk the wrath of police unions, until financial support from law enforcement becomes toxic rather than coveted, until ""defund the politicians"" becomes as much a rallying cry as ""defund the police."" There have been baby steps. Even amid the legislative defeats, the Black Lives Matter movement generated greater transparency, not of the police themselves -- those bills largely failed as well -- but of the political process. When it became evident the decertification bill did not have support to pass the Assembly, advocates shifted their public campaign to lobby for a vote anyway, angry that lawmakers could evade taking a stand.

Unions have sensed the pressure. Of course they support certification, union officials said. This is just not the way to do it. The pandemic shortened the session and made negotiation difficult. These are complicated issues, they said; this bill is dangerous; the process cannot be rushed; this is an act that will have consequences. ""Unknown impacts,"" they warned, to public safety. There is another not particularly subtle subtext about the consequences -- the ones that might befall lawmakers. ""It's not really about substance, it's about power,"" Mr. Crew said. ""It's about the implicit threat of what they could do with their money."" Since 2017, the Peace Officers Research Association, one of the major statewide law enforcement groups, has spent more than $2.6 million to influence elections. One analysis found police unions and associations gave $5.5 million to legislative candidates between 2011 and 2018. Even before the disappointing finish in Sacramento, some reform advocates had started campaigns to demand that politicians pledge to refuse law enforcement money and support. ""Assembly leaders turned their backs on CA's communities by refusing to vote on SB 731 [police decertification] and choosing to protect abusive cops,"" the A.C.L.U. of California wrote. ""If you want change, demand lawmakers stop taking political contributions from police."" A handful of lawmakers have agreed. Two state senators have said they will donate money previously received from law enforcement to community groups. Leaders of several progressive Democratic caucuses have called on the state party to stop accepting contributions from law enforcement unions. Three district attorneys and one candidate in Los Angeles have asked the state bar association to adopt a rule barring lawyers running for district attorney from accepting contributions from law enforcement.

The unions will not easily cede their clout. Politicians will not jettison comfortable habits unless there are consequences. It will take victories by insurgents who stress their independence from police unions and defeats of those who cling to the old paradigms. Unlike New York, California has not yet seen many serious challenges from the left to veteran incumbents. But there are likely to be more, along with generational change as term limits open up new seats. The shootings, the marches, the protests and the vigils will continue. One of Mr. Kizzee's lawyers said his client was shot between 15 and 20 times in the back. The sheriff's department said Mr. Kizzee ran away, dropped a bundle of clothing that included a gun and punched an officer. They will not release the names of the deputies who shot him. They have not even said what traffic violation he might have been committing, other than being a Black man riding a bicycle.","If the protests are to translate into laws, contributions for politicians from law enforcement must become toxic rather than coveted.",c1c19a9b-27c6-5e00-80af-3758ebf5b3b9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/13/opinion/09Pawel1/09Pawel1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=21f35727ccdf6feb8cb4d570348b6ae0498f51cef062dbcf1b834078ffc429f5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Activists gathered in September for a Black Lives Matter protest in Los Angeles.,c1c19a9b-27c6-5e00-80af-3758ebf5b3b9,N24News/imgs/c1c19a9b-27c6-5e00-80af-3758ebf5b3b9.jpg,11
Sports,"In 1969, or 2019, Sailing Round the World Alone Is Vexing",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/sports/golden-globe-race-sailing.html,"In 1968, nine sailors set out to compete in the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race, the first organized, solo, nonstop, round-the-world race. They were heading into the unknown, with no idea how their sailboats or their minds would cope with almost a year in isolation. Some boats broke down, forcing them out of the race. Sailors crumbled under the emotional strain. One competitor, Donald Crowhurst, attempted to fake his circumnavigation, and then simply disappeared, abandoning his boat in the Atlantic. Robin Knox-Johnston was the only finisher, returning on April 22, 1969, after 312 days at sea. To mark the race's 50th anniversary, another Golden Globe Race was planned. Organizers thought this one would be different, but the modern Golden Globe Race has proved to be no easier. Last July, 17 36-foot sailboats departed from Les Sables-d'Olonne, France. Two sailors have made it back there for the finish. Only three remain racing; one is still months from the finish line. Others abandoned their boats 15,000 miles away in the Indian Ocean and are still coming to terms with their dramatic ocean rescues.

""We haven't had as many finishers as we thought,"" Don McIntyre, a founder of the race and a circumnavigator, said. The Golden Globe Race was created to promote ocean sailing for the average sailor, in small boats with modest budgets. Competitors are not allowed to use electric autopilots and instead use wind vanes for self-steering as in the first Golden Globe. Only radio communication is allowed; sextants are used for navigation.

Around 100 people have sailed solo, nonstop, round the world beneath the three great capes -- the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, Cape Leeuwin in Australia and Cape Horn in Chile, the standard course for a solo circumnavigation. Many of these sailors have competed in the Vendee Globe, a solo round-the-world race started in 1989. Unlike the high-speed, modern boats of the Vendee, which can outrun storms by sailing at speeds of 30 knots, the small, full-keeled Golden Globe boats are regularly overrun by depressions, especially in the Southern Ocean.

McIntyre said the 36-foot sailboats use modern masts designed to handle the impact of heavy ocean waves. Yet several boats in the race have been rolled or dismasted, most in the Indian Ocean. Abhilash Tomy, an Indian Navy pilot, severely injured his back when his boat was rolled and dismasted halfway between the Cape of Good Hope and Australia, one of the most remote places on the planet. Another competitor was dismasted in the same storm, which had 70-knot winds and 45-foot waves. Susie Goodall was rescued in early December after her boat went end over end and dismasted 2,000 miles west of Cape Horn. With her boat flooded and no engine or electronics, she called for rescue and was lifted off her foundering boat by the crane of a passing cargo ship. Goodall has yet to talk publicly about her experience. ""Susie was in a desperate situation,"" said McIntyre, who spoke with all the stricken sailors throughout the race to coordinate rescues. ""She put her whole life into this. Then she's picked up by the hook of a crane, and everything leaves instantly."" McIntyre said he had spoken to Tomy about his accident and rescue, but ""there were boundaries -- it was too early.""

""There was a real human aspect to the race,"" said Slats, who tried to help advise Gregor McGuckin over the radio on handling his boat in large waves during a storm before McGuckin was dismasted days later. ""We were really pulling ourselves through this together over the radio."" McIntyre said many of the sailors were not mentally prepared for the isolation of the race. ""These sailors are coming from a different world than in 1969,"" he said. ""We are so used to being connected. This knocked some people out. It's an amazing race, and if you're not there for the right reasons, your mind will find a way to retire from the race."" Those involved also said global weather patterns are producing stronger storms. ""I don't want to hide behind bad luck, but the reality appears to be true, that the conditions in the Southern Ocean are changing and the weather is stronger,"" McIntyre said. Knox-Johnston, who now runs the Clipper Race, a round-the-world sailing race with stops for amateurs, said the effects of climate change could limit these types of races. ""We know with the heating of water, the atmosphere becomes less stable and there are more storms,"" he said. ""If we want people to cross oceans, we have to study this. Will things eventually be too unsafe weatherwise?"" Jean-Luc Van Den Heede of France, who has competed in several round-the-world races, won the Golden Globe trophy on Jan. 29, finishing in 211 days 23 hours 12 minutes. At 73, he is the oldest person to complete the course solo and nonstop, taking the mantle from Knox-Johnston, who was 67 when he completed the Velux 5 Oceans Race in 2007.

Slats, a 42-year-old Dutchman, finished three days behind Van Den Heede. He moved into second in the extreme cold of the Southern Ocean and came within 50 miles of Van Den Heede at one point in the North Atlantic. ""Sometimes I would drop a sail and have to go inside to boil water and warm my hands before rehoisting the new sail,"" he said. Despite the accidents, Knox-Johnston said, lessons learned from the race will benefit sailors. ""I'm talking to all the contestants as to why they were dismasted,"" he said. ""We've learned enough to make it safe for you to sail across an ocean. This will open up so many horizons. It's got to be right. It's good for our sport."" Uku Randmaa and Istvan Kopar are expected to complete the race in mid-March. Tapio Lehtinen, who passed Buenos Aires in the past week, should finish in late June. All but Lehtinen, hindered by massive goose barnacle growth on his boat's bottom, are expected to beat Knox-Johnston's time of 312 days. The Golden Globe Race is now planned for every four years. Though some of the boats in this edition were identical, the 2022 race will feature an open class and a class for replicas of ""Joshua,"" the bright red boat Bernard Moitessier sailed in the first Golden Globe. The Frenchman, after circumnavigating the world once, decided not to finish the race and kept going, landing in Tahiti. Despite their accidents at sea, McGuckin and Tomy are still planning to compete in the 2022 race. McIntyre said there would be a maximum of 20 boats allowed, and 12 entries are confirmed for the next race. Even Goodall said she was interested in racing again. ""Some people just live for adventure; it's human nature,"" she said in a statement after she was rescued. ""And for me, the sea is where my adventure lies.""","Last July, the 17 sailors began the Sunday Times Golden Globe Race in France. Two made it back there for the finish.

Technology,How to Sort Through a Cornucopia of Television Shows,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/technology/personaltech/how-to-sort-through-a-cornucopia-of-television-shows.html,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Aisha Harris, assistant TV editor for The Times, discussed the tech she's using.

What's your setup for watching the TV shows or movies you review? What could be better about it?

Much of my TV and movie consumption for work involves screeners, which are sent out to the press ahead of release. For TV, these screeners are almost always in digital form, via the network's press site or a link sent by email, so I usually watch those on my laptop. On the rare occasion I'm not feeling too lazy -- or if it's a show, like ""Homecoming,"" that really rewards viewing on a bigger screen -- I'll hook up my laptop to my TV. If I'm unable to attend a press screening in person for a movie I'm reviewing, I'll review the DVD at home on my TV.

My fiance and I recently upgraded our home entertainment setup, with a 50-inch 4K Amazon Fire TV. We also own a Sonos soundbar and a two-room Sonos Play:1 wireless speaker set that sounds incredible.

The only downside is that the wireless speakers have been cutting in and out for some time when paired with our TV. Troubleshooting on our own thus far hasn't yielded great results, and the tech support hours coincide with when we're at work. It's a fairly common problem, according to the multiple message boards I've stumbled upon, so I'm hoping someone can help us find a quick, easy solution soon.",Our assistant TV editor has a state-of-the-art setup for watching shows and movies.

Automobiles,Arriving in Style Just as the Tailgate Party Winds Down,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/automobiles/autoreviews/arriving-in-style-just-as-the-tailgate-party-winds-down.html,"Considering the rarity of station wagons in America, BMW's new tailgating 3 Series set me wondering: who exactly spends $50,000 or more on a compact wagon, instead of going the usual American route with an S.U.V. or a crossover? In certain locales scented with artisanal coffee and self-affirmation -- college towns, gentrified urban blocks, Ralph Lauren suburbs -- the natives have circled the wagons for what may be their last stand. Strangely, considering the station wagon's wood-paneled role in American cultural history, today's downsized models rarely seem to have children on board. Instead, they seem to be favored by bearded software developers, practical-performance iconoclasts and empty nesters in mourning for the boxy old Volvos and Subarus they once drove. Like many people who write about cars, I also have a thing for wagons, the more out-there, the better. For instance, the Cadillac CTS-V, Mercedes E63 AMG and Ferrari FF wagons -- the latter the most unexpected of all -- make a combined 1,784 horsepower, and their average top speed is nearly 195 m.p.h. But you're as likely to see a Lamborghini at your local Dairy Queen as to spot any of those exotic family haulers pulling up for Xtreme Blizzards. To ensure their survival, even mainstream wagons may soon need a nature preserve -- perhaps a simulated ""Leave It to Beaver"" environment of pink houses and picket fences.

This year, Americans have just nine wagon models to choose from, down from 24 in 2004, according to LMC Automotive, an industry research firm. Their percentage of the market, not strong to begin with, slipped to 1.1 percent last year, to a paltry 165,000 sales. (A single model, the Subaru Outback, accounted for 112,000 of those.) As the enlarged version of the latest 3 Series sedan, the 328i xDrive does its part to keep wagons from extinction. It's an especially handsome member of its herd, with a squinty version of BMW's twin-kidney grille and a streamlined, scalloped fuselage. Compared with the former model, the Sports Wagon has grown 3.5 inches in length and almost 2 inches in wheelbase. The BMW's track, or the space between the opposing wheels, is 1.2 inches wider up front and 1.6 inches in back. The result is nearly an inch more of legroom in the back seat and an 8 percent increase in cargo volume, to 53 cubic feet. For all of a wagon's advantages over S.U.V.'s -- reduced weight, better aerodynamics and mileage, generally superior handling -- its relatively low roofline remains the biggest practical demerit. BMW's X3 crossover S.U.V. can fit 62 percent more gear behind its second row and nearly 20 percent more over all. That includes taller, bulkier items -- furniture, bicycles, boxes -- than the wagon can swallow.

Yet the new BMW makes the most of its modest dimensions. The redesign, which includes more high-strength steel, carves out a larger hatch opening. The load floor is lower to the ground, too, for easier lifting of cargo. A power tailgate opens via the remote key or an interior button. If you order the Comfort Access feature, the tailgate swings open when you wiggle a foot under the rear bumper, a useful hands-free feature first offered by Ford. The rear seat folds flat in a 40-20-40 arrangement, making it easy to haul, say, four sets of skis for four passengers. The cargo area gets four tie-downs, a 12-volt outlet and coat hooks. With run-flat tires eliminating the spare, there's extra space under the floor; in a clever touch, the retracting rear luggage cover detaches for storage below deck when it's not needed. A rear-view camera with a 360-degree top-down view, part of a $1,900 Driver Assistance Package, made it a breeze to park without scraping the pretty 18-inch alloy rims on the curb.

Figuring there's no sense importing myriad models to satisfy a tiny cult of American wagon enthusiasts, BMW offers only xDrive all-wheel-drive versions with the excellent 8-speed automatic transmission. So there's no rear-drive version, no manual transmission and no 335i variant with its turbocharged 300-horsepower in-line 6. What BMW does offer is gasoline and diesel engines whose performance and mileage are unmatched in its field. The 328i gets the 2-liter turbo TwinPower 4 with 241 horses and 258 pound-feet of torque. That gas-burning wagon hustles to 60 m.p.h. in six seconds, with the free-revving brio and wall-to-wall torque that's a signature of this remarkable motor. Stand outside, and you'll hear the engine's tick-tick idle and direct-injector noise, but the uncouth behavior disappears once the car is under way. The same can't be said for the standard engine stop-start function, which restarts the car at stoplights with an intrusive shudder.

The 328i is also rated at 22 miles per gallon in town and 33 on the highway, and that's no fooling. Set to its EcoPro mode, the BMW actually indicated 35 m.p.g. over a long 60 m.p.h. cruise -- commendable economy for such a strong, relatively spacious car. Premium fuel, of course, is required. That Eco Pro setting saves gas by softening the accelerator response, selecting higher gears and dialing back the power to systems like the heated seats and climate control. Drivers can select Comfort and Sport settings as well. As in other BMWs with this small-caliber engine, the wagon sipped responsibly even when my driving was anything but. Hammered from New York to Boston in a convoy with a Corvette and two German sedans, the BMW still returned 30 m.p.g. A truly miserly wagon master can opt for the diesel version, the 328d xDrive, which starts at $43,875, a reasonable $1,500 premium over the gasoline-sipping car. The 328d's 2-liter turbodiesel -- with 180 horsepower and 280 pound-feet of torque -- is rated 31 m.p.g. city, 43 highway. (The same diesel engine in the rear-drive 328d sedan achieves 32/45 m.p.g.) Nor is the diesel wagon a slouch in acceleration, moving from a standstill to 60 m.p.h. in 7.7 seconds. BMW says the new wagon's structure is 10 percent stiffer. Ride quality, even with the run-flat tires, is smoother than Robin Thicke at a Ladies' Night. Yet there's a growing chink in the BMW's once-impregnable armor. This is the softest, spongiest 3 Series I can recall, with too little feedback from the electric power steering. The steering is accuracy itself, and the BMW will still fly through curves. But on initial flights, neither the car nor the driver gains the confidence you expect from this handling benchmark. Opting for the $1,000 Dynamic Handling Package, which adds variable sport steering and a stiffer M sport suspension, should help firm the flab.

Your Money,Tough Choices for Succession in the Family Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/13/your-money/tough-choices-for-succession-in-the-family-business.html,"SHARON MADISON was enjoying a successful career in marketing and advertising at Verizon Communications when she took a leave of absence to work for her family's business, United Building Maintenance. She joined her twin brother to help their father, who was ill. When their father died a few years later, she found herself running a company she had little interest in. Jeffrey Wolf never worked anywhere other than his father's company, which manufactured private-label suits in New York for stores like Macy's, Jos. A. Banks Clothiers and Men's Wearhouse. But at the end of 2010, finding it tougher to compete against companies abroad that made suits more cheaply, Mr. Wolf's father decided to close the business. It took Mr. Wolf more than a year and a half to find a job, at a far lower salary. Adam Brewster's situation falls somewhere between Ms. Madison's and Mr. Wolf's. His parents' business -- which represents manufacturers of wood stoves, fireplaces and alternative fuels -- is not as lucrative as it once was. Mr. Brewster, the oldest of three, is expected to take it over. At 37, he is not sure he wants it, but he also has no clear alternative for earning a living. Founders of family businesses who are nearing the end of their run generally have two options: Sell it to someone or bring in family members to run it. While the first pays the founders for their work, it denies them the legacy of keeping it in the family.

Yet founders don't always consider what their adult children might want. Is running the family business something they are interested in or would be good at? Should they join the business at a young age or be encouraged to find work elsewhere first and apply to the company later? And how can children who do not want to be in the family business tell their parents without seeming ungrateful for all that the business has afforded them, or worse, being shunned? ""What amazes me is the number of families that get to the designation point and the person looks up and says, 'I don't want it,' "" said Stephen Salley, a partner at Banyan Family Business Advisors. ""Even the most successful of businesses have these blind spots. It's shocking how many families don't talk about this."" There are consultants who advise families on their businesses, addressing, among other topics, how to have the open discussions. Their recommendations are sensible. The first step: talk early and often about the business. These conversations are not just about what parents do and what the businesses produce; they are about how founders think about the future of their businesses -- what will happen after they retire -- and about the roles, if any, children want or are suited for. ""The best-case scenario is parents say, 'This business may or may not be an opportunity for you; you have to earn it and maybe come back after having been successful in another business,' "" said Michael A. Klein, a clinical psychologist who works with family businesses and the author of ""Trapped in the Family Business: A Practical Guide to Uncovering and Managing This Hidden Dilemma.""

""This is hard to do,"" he added. ""It can conflict with the parents' needs or egos. Their identity is too wrapped up in the business."" Some families have these discussions and set parameters for children who want to be in the business as well as give reassurances to those who want to do something else. But then there are families that are not proactive. It's easy to avoid a conversation about parental expectations or children's desires. Children may be concerned about coming across as thankless, and parents may fail to imagine their children passing on the business that was their life's work. Too often, advisers say, this reaches a peak when a decision about the company must be made. ""If you think about it, if you were my father and had raised me in a very affluent environment with a business that has our name on it and I say, 'That's the last thing I want to do,' I look like an ingrate -- and the father thinks, 'I have been betrayed,'"" Mr. Salley said. ""If you think about that same conversation but five years earlier,"" Mr. Salley added, ""when the son says, 'I'm not really interested in this; I'm interested in social work,' the dad may be disappointed, but he has time to think about it."" Mr. Brewster says this is the situation he has found himself in with his father, who plans to retire next year and turn the business over to him. ""I blame myself for a lot of this,"" he said. ""I never said this is what I'm going to do, this is my passion. In some ways I fell back on the family business. But the real reason was loyalty and taking care of my family.""

But having that conversation to leave a family business, especially when the child has been successful in it, can be difficult and requires delicate planning. ""If you've been the No. 2 guy at the company for a couple of years, finding a new No. 2 is not all that easy,"" said Mark Elefante, a partner at the law firm Hemenway & Barnes. ""You need to be thoughtful and careful about how you extricate yourself from that situation."" Amy Zehnder, a strategic wealth coach with Ascent Private Capital Management, says she advises all family businesses, even well-functioning ones, to create a diagram that lays out everyone's responsibilities and authority. ""It outlines the whole process,"" she said. ""It gives the family member very clear guidance as to where they need to move. They're not stepping on toes."" Ms. Madison said two of the things she took from her time at Verizon and applied to her father's business when she joined were maintaining her sense of professionalism and drawing on the key things that had made her successful in her previous career. ""I was used to all the different levels of authority, but in a family business, the buck stops with you,"" she said. ""I never changed who I was or how I performed or the quality of the work I did."" And when Ms. Madison decided to leave after six years, she said she used the skills she acquired as chief operating officer to move into a similar position at a nonprofit organization.

Her role today is as a board member and trustee of the trust that owns the company. She would not discuss the state of her relationship with her brother, who is the company's chief executive. Mr. Wolf said he regretted never working anywhere other than his father's company and has advised other children to work somewhere else, even if they wanted to be in the family business. When his father closed the business, Mr. Wolf struggled mightily, he said. ""I was left high and dry with a wife and two kids and a mortgage,"" Mr. Wolf said. ""I'd never worked anywhere else in my life."" He said he wished his father had pushed him to do something else, yet acknowledged that he enjoyed the many privileges of being the boss's son -- until he lost that role at 44. ""What boss's son has a resume?"" he said. ""What boss's son has ever been on an interview? The boss's son is used to asking the questions, not having to answer them. The learning curve was steep."" Today, at 49, he works for an intellectual property company but says he feels a decade behind in his career. For Mr. Brewster, the toughest part now is being in limbo. He once briefly left his father's company to work in the fitness industry before returning, and said he is now working a second job as a fitness coach. ""I want to be able to say to my dad, 'This is what I want do,' and with an amount of success he can visibly see, so he won't have an argument anymore,"" Mr. Brewster said. ""If I've ever wanted to do anything, I've had to have the answer -- if not this then what? This is what I want to do, and this is my answer.""","When it's time for founders to pass the torch, a fallout can occur, leaving adult children feeling slighted. But proactive steps can help ease the transition.",5140368c-b16e-5113-867a-288b47f9c410,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/12/business/13wealth-web/13wealth-web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=5a3cc9c1a6f5261c0327403532dfd476ef5a841b2a6678f8b51c7a2deb06cdd7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Adam Brewster has been helping to run his family business since 2006 but has recently begun to pursue his passion of becoming a health and wellness coach.,5140368c-b16e-5113-867a-288b47f9c410,N24News/imgs/5140368c-b16e-5113-867a-288b47f9c410.jpg,21
Fashion & Style,Were London's Fashion Awards Really the Oscars-Meets-the-Met-Gala?,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/fashion/news/fashion-awards-london-gucci-ralph-lauren.html,"And the answer was ... Alexander McQueen for British brand of the year, and British Vogue for special recognition (for achieving the ripe old age of 100). Vetements, the rebellious French streetwear label, won international urban luxury brand, while its co-founder Demna Gvasalia was named international ready-to-wear designer for his second job, artistic director of Balenciaga. Gucci picked up two trophies: A gold-tuxedo-clad designer Alessandro Michele (with the actor Jared Leto in tow) won best international accessories designer, and the chief executive, Marco Bizzarri, took best international business leader. Ralph Lauren showed a 10-minute film, complete with family tributes and rousing orchestral scores, upon winning the outstanding achievement award. And then there was Gigi Hadid who, wearing a powder-blue Atelier Versace jumpsuit and accessorizing with her mother, Yolanda Foster, sobbed into the microphone upon beating both her sister Bella Hadid and friend Kendall Jenner to international model of the year.

""I am of a generation immersed in social media, and am so blessed to be a part of that,"" she said, her chest heaving with emotion. But, she said, several people in the industry -- including the designer Bruce Oldfield; the American Vogue editor in chief, Anna Wintour; and Mr. Testino -- ""looked beyond what the rest of the world could see and I am so grateful to you. Thank you for letting me be part of your family.""

So far, so standard awards-speak. But there were moments that suggested we were not actually in Hollywood or New York, after all. Marilyn Manson arrived, presenting the award to Vetements, and upended an envelope of salt on the stage, pretending that it was cocaine (it was not entirely clear why he did that). Craig Green, winner of the prize for best British men's wear designer, almost completely disrobed Lady Gaga after she gave him his award by accidentally stomping on her Brandon Maxwell maxi-gown on his way to the podium. And Jack Whitehall, the British comedian and host for the evening, attempted to entertain the crowd with gags around the Mannequin Challenge, the latest charity drive sweeping the internet. The problem was, he picked the wrong target.

""If you need any tips on how to do it then just check out Anna Wintour. That frozen-faced lady has been perfecting it long before it was even a thing,"" he said, as Ms. Wintour sat meters away. No one in the audience moved a muscle.

Still, the overall atmosphere was one of celebration and optimism, despite ominous whispers about the world's fragile political and economic state that could be heard between the applause.","With a new-look, globalized event, along with Marilyn Manson and Ralph Lauren, Britain attempts to position itself as an arbiter of international style.",1e689d99-29dd-5073-8c0f-b25b7546a139,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/05/fashion/05FASHION-AWARDS-COMBO/05FASHION-AWARDS-COMBO-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=cfd02012fd0501d43051c2b48d0768ddfa45237ffc4e06778988d3caf5dc7220&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left: Lady Gaga, Gigi Hadid and Naomi Campbell.",1e689d99-29dd-5073-8c0f-b25b7546a139,N24News/imgs/1e689d99-29dd-5073-8c0f-b25b7546a139.jpg,19
Health,Lyme Disease Is Spreading Fast. Why Isn't There a Vaccine?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/14/health/lyme-disease-vaccine.html,"Lyme disease is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks. The tick above, in its larval stage, is no bigger than the period at the end of this sentence.

We've all heard the advice about avoiding Lyme disease. If you walk through wooded or grassy areas where it's prevalent, you should use insect repellent. Cover exposed skin. Check yourself thoroughly once you return home, and take a shower. If you see a tick, pluck it off your skin with tweezers. Look out for a bull's eye-shaped rash and flulike symptoms in the summer. About 30,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention each year, making it the most commonly reported vector-borne illness in the United States. That number has tripled over the last 20 years. And experts estimate that the actual number of cases -- not just those that happen to be reported to the agency -- is more like 300,000 per year. If Lyme has become so common, why isn't there a vaccine for it? Well, here's something you may not know: There used to be one, but it was taken off the market more than 15 years ago. And there's only one new vaccine candidate in the pipeline. ""Clearly, the problem is getting worse,"" said Dr. Paul Mead, a top scientist at the C.D.C. ""For years, we have been advocating that people use repellents, do tick checks, spray their yards. That remains good to do, but it's not enough.""

[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Here are the basics Lyme disease was first recognized in the mid-1970s, after a cluster of adults and children in Lyme, Conn., started experiencing symptoms of arthritis. Additional symptoms may include fever, headache, fatigue and rash. The disease is mainly found in Northeastern and North-central states and Northern California, though a recent report found it had spread to all 50 states. It's also found in parts of Canada, Europe and northern Asia. Lyme disease is usually handled with a short course of antibiotics. But without treatment, infections can spread to the heart and nervous system and cause serious problems. Additionally, some patients experience symptoms even after taking antibiotics, what the C.D.C. refers to as ""post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome."" ""Chronic Lyme"" is also a term you may have heard. It is sometimes used to describe persistent symptoms of infection, even in people who have not received a diagnosis of Lyme. The C.D.C. and many other experts don't support the use of the term because of that confusion.

But the company took it off the market less than four years later, citing low sales, amid lawsuits from patients who said the vaccine caused severe arthritis and other symptoms. Some claimed that the vaccine had provoked an autoimmune reaction. Studies never showed a direct link between LYMErix and any chronic side effect or serious complication. But patients' claims about it, and resulting media coverage, were sufficient to make doctors and patients wary. Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccinologist at the Mayo Clinic, has written that public concern, induced by anti-vaccine groups and class action lawsuits, resulted in LYMErix being withdrawn from the market. ""There's a big difference between what's claimed and what's proven,"" he said. The high cost of the vaccine and confusion over who should get it and how many doses were needed didn't help its prospects. Additionally, a vaccine was never intended to replace ""personal protective measures"" like tick checks. After all, ticks can carry a number of diseases besides Lyme. Dr. Stanley A. Plotkin, an emeritus professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania, said that the loss of the vaccine was a ""public health fiasco."" He and other researchers said that in the years since, public opposition prevented drug companies from investing in another vaccine that could fail on the market. ""It's a situation that has never existed before,"" he said. ""You have a vaccine that works, you know it works, you know the disease is prevalent, but there's no vaccine on the market, except for dogs.""

Dr. Mead of the C.D.C. said that the issues with LYMErix were complicated, but that subsequent studies did not bear out the safety concerns that were raised at the time. In addition, Lyme disease was a lot less common 20 years ago, so the need wasn't as great. Some experts thought Lyme could be controlled if people were vigilant about checking themselves. But the rise in cases shows that's insufficient. ""We need more options on the table,"" he said. ""Which is why we certainly strongly support the development of a safe and effective vaccine."" A European company called Valneva says that it is making progress on VLA15, a vaccine that would protect against six strains of Lyme, including the one most prevalent in the United States.

Valneva's chief executive, Thomas Lingelbach, said that the developers at his company had taken the concerns surrounding LYMErix into consideration, and that out of an abundance of caution, they had engineered the new vaccine so that it would not create an autoimmune reaction. ""It is a very different vaccine than LYMErix,"" he said. The vaccine is being tested now, and the company hopes to seek licensing in about five years.

Meanwhile, Dr. Erol Fikrig, the chief of infectious diseases at Yale Medical School and one of the developers of LYMErix, is trying to target the tick itself. He's in the early stages of research on a vaccine that could prevent ticks from transmitting Lyme and other diseases. ""I believe it's promising,"" he said. ""But time will tell."" Dr. Phillip J. Baker, the executive director of the American Lyme Disease Foundation, a nonprofit group run by volunteers, predicted that opposition from Lyme groups that are suspicious of the medical establishment would hinder any vaccine's prospects. ""There's a lot of misinformation out there about Lyme,"" he said. ""We're making some progress, but we've got a long way to go."" Patricia V. Smith, the president of another advocacy group, the Lyme Disease Association, is among those who are skeptical about the new vaccine. ""I would like to see safe and effective vaccines developed,"" she said. ""But those are the key words."" Ms. Smith added that Valneva hadn't been proactive enough about reaching out to patients' groups to share its findings. The company said in response that it planned to increase outreach efforts as the vaccine got closer to hitting the market. ""It is part of our ongoing mission to become more proactively engaged with advocacy groups,"" Valneva said. ""We encourage patients and advocacy groups to reach out to us, and we will be working to do the same to establish a dialogue with the patient community.""","The only vaccine was taken off the market more than 15 years ago.

Movies,'The Glorias' | Anatomy of a Scene,https://www.nytimes.com/video/movies/100000007369972/the-glorias-scene.html,"My name is Julie Taymor. I'm the director and co-writer of The Glorias. ""Do you think that there is a paradox between women's attitudes toward the fact that they don't want to be treated as sex objects and the fact that you dress very sexily?"" So we're about halfway through the film and we have had Alicia Vikander play Gloria from age 20 to 39 or 40. And in this film, I have four Glorias-- the six-year-old, the 12-year-old, Alicia plays this age, and Julianne Moore plays 40 to 80. At this point, Michael Lowry, who is playing the interviewer, is commenting on her clothes. He alludes and flirts to the fact that she is a sex object. And this is a point where I have her, Alicia, replaced by Julianne. Julianne then takes the seat, and so she does talk to the interviewer about the fact that this black t-shirt, black pants, and boots-- it's her uniform. And after she does that, the audience starts to see what's actually in her head. And I go into a surreal sequence now. And now I allow the other Glorias to appear. The first one to come is Alicia comes back dressed like a nun in a kind of Handmaid's Tale-ish-- Sandy Powell did the costumes-- red garment habit with this incredible nun white hat that's like The Flying Nun hat. And then the gust of wind blows it up. And underneath, you see the Bunny costume, because the Alicia Vikander actor played the part in Gloria's life where she went undercover as a Bunny in the Playboy Club to talk about working conditions. And then the little Gloria, Ryan Kira Armstrong, comes running up, jumps on the platform and onto the lap of the interviewer, and whispers in his ear-- ""What's a sex object?"" It breaks your heart in a way. Then we go to the 12, 13-year-old Gloria, played by Lulu Wilson. [MUSIC PLAYING] And once we do that, I go into full surreal mode with the tornado inspired as a true homage to The Wizard of Oz with Elliot Goldenthal's extraordinary score. It's the one place where he uses full orchestra, and it's scary and absolutely helps with the scene. [MUSIC PLAYING] I went full out into shooting the women-- the four Glorias in green screen, where we had to have a full wraparound green screen and a huge crane that Rodrigo Prieto, our spectacular DP, operated. And we had each one, one by one, on wires. And then the real work comes in post, because you cut the scene together, and then with fabulous visual effects houses, we put together the tornado in post. We're back to reality. So we realize that it's just two or three seconds of a pause, where Gloria has not found the words. ""Could you rewind that, please?"" - [GARBLED SPEECH] ""What were you saying?"" ""I hope you forgive our masculine notion that you're an absolutely stunning sex object."" ""Forgive.""

Real Estate,When the Dog Decides Where You Live,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/realestate/when-the-dog-decides-where-you-live.html,"Last year, Kaitlin and Ben Fund decided to give up their rental near Penn Station and look for an apartment several blocks south of the commuter tumult. It was a perfectly understandable decision, but the couple worried about how the move would affect their golden retriever, Hobie. Three-year-old Hobie had been a regular at the New York Dog Spa and Hotel on West 25th Street since puppyhood, ""and we all really liked it,"" said Ms. Fund, 27, who works at a public relations firm. ""When we bought Hobie,"" she continued, ""we promised ourselves that because he's a big dog we would send him to day care so he wouldn't be cooped up at home with nothing to do."" Hobie's hangout was a very manageable six blocks away from the Funds' old apartment; it opened early and closed late, an important consideration for the couple, who work long hours.

""And the facilities weren't that nice. They were sort of smelly,"" Ms. Fund said. Finally, they lucked into a rental a mere block and a half from Hobie's old day care. ""It worked out incredibly well,"" said Ms. Fund, who sees nothing strange about her priorities. ""Hobie is a huge part of our lives, and he goes with us just about everywhere."" Apartment-hunting New Yorkers have their wish lists -- a view, a formal dining room, a roof deck -- and their roster of must-haves -- a doorman, a gym, a storage bin, a bedroom that can hold more than a cot. But for a certain breed of pet owners, Fido's needs take precedence over their silly human desires. As a consequence, these people give a wide berth to apartments and neighborhoods they themselves might prefer, buy or rent larger apartments than they might otherwise require, and, in a few instances, take a big financial hit for a change of address. ""Many people who don't have children view their pets as their children, and they consider their pets' needs in the same way others would consider how the schools or playgrounds are in a particular neighborhood,"" said Arlene Kagle, a psychologist who recently moved from New York to Richmond, Va., with her husband, Jerry Lerner, and their dog, Lucy. For the record, Lucy had no say in her owners' housing decisions.

That group might well include the couple whose elderly dog had a pet peeve about being stuck in New York traffic. ""They had a weekend house and they wanted their primary residence to be close to the F.D.R. so they could get out of town quickly for the sake of the dog, because otherwise he would get very stressed,"" said Barbara J. Dervan, an associate broker at Fox Residential Group. The solution: an apartment on East End Avenue. ""Not all clients who have pets are intense,"" Ms. Dervan added. ""But over the last five to eight years, even people who don't have pets have shied away from buildings with a no-pet policy. It takes away the option of buyers to change their mind about pet ownership in the future. And when they go to resell their apartment there are fewer people willing to look at it."" Some newly developed condos and rentals have been responding to the pet-possessed with far more than a pet-friendly policy. There are on-site day care and dog-walking services and grooming stations. Such amenities were partly what inspired Bert Saville to rent at MiMA, a mixed-use high-rise in Hell's Kitchen. Three years ago, when Mr. Saville, 39, a marketing manager at Pernod Ricard U.S.A., the wine and spirits company, moved to New York from Miami, he knew what he wanted: a walk-up, preferably in a brownstone; failing that, an apartment on a high floor with a grand view of the city. Dreams, dreams, idle dreams. None of this was going to work for Wesley, Mr. Saville's harlequin Great Dane. Climbing stairs would have been tough on Wesley's legs, so an elevator building was a must. But an apartment high in the sky, Mr. Saville's preference, wouldn't have served Wesley's needs, either. ""I wouldn't say I'm ruled by my dog, but I have to give up a certain number of things because of him,"" Mr. Saville said. Despite his own preferences for an eyeful of cityscape and sky, he looked for a vacancy on the lowest floor available.

""Elevators can stop at every floor and when there's an emergency and Wesley's got to go, being able to get out of the building quickly was important."" Also important: a bedroom large enough to accommodate a California king bed -- another Wesley-driven necessity, because the dog bunks down with Mr. Saville. Oh, and the apartment had to have a washer and dryer. It seems that Wesley sheds. MiMA offered another advantage: location, location, location. Mr. Saville's office is near Grand Central; he can hop on the 7 train at lunch and get home in short order to spend some quality midday time with Wesley. ""I consider him my child,"" Mr. Saville said. That's exactly how Kristen Ruby feels about Caicos, her 11-month old white teacup Pomeranian. And parents make sacrifices for their children, which is why Ms. Ruby, 29, the head of a public relations company, is staying put in Lower Manhattan even though she'd rather move back to Greenwich, Conn., where she lived for three years and where most of her clients are based. ""I think the No. 1 thing is proximity to the dog walker you've established a relationship with,"" Ms. Ruby said. ""I think it would be mean to Caicos if I packed him up and left and introduced him to a new dog walker. He has play dates with the dog walker. The dog walker takes him to the vet. Not everyone understands how important that is when you're thinking about where to live."" And, almost certainly, a move out of the city would put Caicos in social jeopardy. The people who came to his six-month birthday bash, a celebration that included party hats, ""wouldn't go all the way to Greenwich for his next party,"" Ms. Ruby said.

Dogs, of course, are not the only animals that can bend New Yorkers to their will. If it weren't for Justin, a very assertive eclectus parrot, and to a lesser extent, Tammy, a conure, Geri Mazur could live in a co-op and not a condo, a more expensive option. ""But,"" she said, ""it's very unlikely that a co-op would approve me with a squawking parrot."" And if it weren't for Justin, whose full name is Justin Case, Ms. Mazur, 56, a marketing consultant, would not need two bedrooms. ""But I work from home,"" she said. ""I'd have my desk in the living room, but he's so jealous he screams when I'm on the phone and it's very disruptive. I have to go into another room and close the door. If you think about it, he's costing me an extra $300,000."" When Joanne Floyd, an anesthesiologist, and Jeffrey Bilotta, a gastroenterologist, moved from New York to Terre Haute, Ind., 25 years ago, ""it was self-inflicted exile,"" said Dr. Floyd, 60. ""We'd always planned to come back when we retired, which we did last year."" With them came Mick, a 15-year-old English cocker spaniel. Here is all you need to know about the family dynamic: ""If the dog isn't happy, we're miserable,"" Dr. Floyd said. The couple thought about living downtown, but ""there are so many people on the sidewalks we thought it would be terrible to walk a dog down there,"" Dr. Floyd said. She and Dr. Bilotta, 65, ultimately settled on the Upper East Side, partly because of the wide, relatively unpopulated sidewalks, partly because of the proximity to Central Park and partly because it was a straight shot to the Animal Medical Center on East 62nd Street. ""We did consider the location of our vet, because Mick had been ill at one time and we had to drive several hours in Indiana to get him treatment,"" Dr. Floyd said.

""We talk about what we would do differently if we were dog-free, and one of the things we would do is have a smaller place in New York and travel more,"" Dr. Floyd said. ""It's bigger because of Mick. We wanted to have more room for him to roam."" And after all, Mick does have six inner tube-size beds scattered throughout the apartment: two in the master bedroom, two in the den and two in the living room. Michelle Mahoney, a 20-year resident of Manhattan, gave Westport, Conn., a try for a few years. As part of the experiment in suburban living, she and her husband, Fred Salkind, 54, the executive creative director of a design agency, acquired two canines, Ravello, now 3, a Bernese mountain dog, and Stevie, also 3, a mixed-breed rescue dog. A year or so ago, when the commute became onerous, the couple decided to return to the city, and bought a loft in Dumbo, Brooklyn, ""because with the waterfront we thought it might feel like Connecticut, even though our preference was to live on the Upper West Side,"" said Ms. Mahoney, 45, a freelance television producer. But almost immediately, Ravello became terrified of the bridges near her new home, and all the attendant noise. ""She would lie in the lobby of our building trying to work up the courage to go outside,"" Ms. Mahoney said. ""The other residents didn't appreciate it and the building threatened legal action.""

She makes little of the assault on the family bank account -- ""we were willing to do what we did at whatever cost so our dogs could be safe"" -- and makes no apologies for the decisions she and her husband made for the sake of their pets. ""Some people think I'm crazy, but if you're a dog person, you totally get it,"" Ms. Mahoney said. ""When I got Ravello and Stevie, I promised to protect them, and if it means selling an apartment, that's O.K."" Ms. Mazur, seeking a change, recently sold her apartment in Park Slope. She is in contract to buy another condo, in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn. But she worries that the living room in her new place will be too small for Justin and Tammy. ""It's a real estate issue,"" she said. Her living room must accommodate the sofa, the entertainment console, the dining table and the two bird cages, one of which is the size of a refrigerator. ""Because of Justin, I'm constrained about where I can live and what kind of apartment I can live in, but I won't give him up,"" Ms. Mazur added. ""He has a great vocabulary and he understands context. He's an amazing creature."" This amazing creature calls Ms. Mazur ""Mommy."" ""If I don't answer, he says 'Are you sleeping?' "" she said. ""You make a lot of accommodations for a pet like that. It shows he loves me, and I don't have to pay for college.""",Some New Yorkers hunt for apartments with the needs of a pet uppermost in their minds.

Media,"Writers Mutiny at 'All Rise,' the Rare CBS Show With a Black Female Lead",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/business/media/all-rise-cbs-writers.html,"The courtroom drama ""All Rise"" was something rare for CBS when it made its debut in September: a prime-time drama with a Black woman as its protagonist. After bringing in an average of more than five million viewers per episode, it was renewed for a second season in May. But almost from the start of production last summer, many of the staff writers clashed with the show runner, Greg Spottiswood, over how the program handled race and gender. Now that work is underway for the second season of ""All Rise,"" which stars Simone Missick as an idealistic Los Angeles judge, five writers from the original staff of seven are gone. Among those who quit were the program's three highest-ranking writers of color. Produced by Warner Bros. Television, a division of AT&T's WarnerMedia, ""All Rise"" is loosely based on a 2005 nonfiction book, ""Courtroom 302,"" about a white male judge in Cook County, Ill. In an effort to make it of the moment, Mr. Spottiswood, a white writer-producer, changed the main character to a Black woman. For CBS, a network that had been criticized for a prime-time lineup that lacked diversity, ""All Rise"" was a key part of a new wave of programming meant to better reflect the American population.

Shernold Edwards, a Black woman who has been a writer-producer on Fox's ""Sleepy Hollow"" and other shows, said she had left ""All Rise"" in November after disagreements with Mr. Spottiswood. ""We had to do so much behind the scenes to keep these scripts from being racist and offensive,"" she said in an interview. Sunil Nayar, an Indian-American television writer who has worked on ABC's ""Revenge"" and CBS's ""CSI: Miami,"" also said he had left after disputes with Mr. Spottiswood. Some of them had to do with his attempts to have ""All Rise"" accurately reflect the experiences of Black people and other people of color, he said; another point of contention was that, in his view, Mr. Spottiswood seemed more interested in having him appear at public events than in giving him duties that matched his job title, executive producer. ""It became clear to me, when I left the show, that I was only there because I'm the brown guy,"" Mr. Nayar said in an interview. ""Greg hired me to be his brown guy."" Warner Bros. said in a statement that Mr. Spottiswood, from the beginning, had ""insisted on having a co-show runner to serve as a trusted and valued partner to promote diverse storytelling with the series."" It added, ""The truth is, the intended partnership we all hoped for did not materialize.""

Mr. Spottiswood, who started his career in Canadian television after growing up in Ontario, said he was aware of the problems with his leadership and pledged to do better. ""When it appeared the writers' room was struggling to function as effectively as it should, I recognized that I needed to change how I was working,"" he said in a statement. ""I voluntarily sought management training and leadership coaching."" CBS had no comment. A network spokesman referred interview requests to Warner Bros. ""As soon as we became aware of concerns in the 'All Rise' writers' room, we took steps to conduct a review of the work environment,"" Warner Bros. said in a statement. ""While the studio identified areas for improvement, the findings did not reveal conduct that would warrant removing series creator Greg Spottiswood from the executive producer role."" The backstage problems at ""All Rise"" have come to light during the widespread protests prompted by the police killing of George Floyd, a movement that has caused some entertainment companies to question longstanding industry practices. Last month, CBS Television Studios and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People announced a production deal for NAACP-produced content. The network announced that 25 percent of its programs would come from creators who are people of color and pledged that, by the 2022-23 season, 50 percent of the writers on its shows would be people of color.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. CBS Television Studios also took steps last month to clean up part of the CBS prime-time lineup when it fired the prolific producer Peter Lenkov, the show runner of ""Magnum P. I.,"" ""MacGyver"" and ""Hawaii 5-0."" A CBS investigation concluded that he had favored male employees and spoken inappropriately to women and people of color.

Mr. Spottiswood hired a diverse crew to write ""All Rise."" Of the original seven writers, two were white men. The ones who left the show said Mr. Spottiswood had sometimes ignored, rejected or resisted their attempts to have the characters and story lines accurately reflect the experiences of Black people and other people of color. The lead character was sometimes given dialogue or story lines that seemed false or offensively stereotypical, one of the writers, Ms. Edwards, said. When she told colleagues that certain scenes inaccurately depicted how a Black woman would speak or act, she was asked why the character's race mattered, she added.

""The fact that I'm still being asked that question tells me that there are people on the show who are incapable of writing for people of color and should not be writing for people of color,"" Ms. Edwards wrote in an email to the show's top producers shortly before her departure. She shared the email with The New York Times. Ms. Edwards and Mr. Nayar said the problems had been apparent as early as the second episode, which included a story line centered on the character Emily Lopez, a public defender who had recently left her physically abusive husband. As the character, played by the actress Jessica Camacho, enters the courthouse, she is having a conversation with Sara Castillo, a court reporter played by Lindsay Mendez, about how hard it is to live alone. In the original script, Ms. Mendez's character tells Ms. Camacho's character that ""a one-night stand"" would solve her problem. Some writers said the dialogue, while meant to be funny, was an insensitive response to a character grappling with the consequences of domestic abuse. As the sequence progresses, the two women get on an elevator. A naked white man joins them, and they continue their conversation as if nothing odd is going on. Mr. Nayar and Ms. Edwards said they had sent emails to Mr. Spottiswood objecting to the scene after the majority of the show's writers found it objectionable.

Mr. Nayar wrote a scene in which the bailiff, played by J. Alex Brinson, and the lead character, played by Ms. Missick, discuss racist policing. Mr. Spottiswood killed the scene, arguing that such harassment was so common that it would not merit a discussion between two Black co-workers, Mr. Nayar said. After Ms. Missick complained about the omission, saying her character would look callous if she did not acknowledge what had happened to her colleague, Mr. Nayar rewrote the scene, he said. (Ms. Missick declined to comment.) A later episode, with a script credited to Greg Nelson, a white colleague of Mr. Spottiswood's from his days in Canadian television, included a subplot about a gang of Latin American teenagers who terrorize citizens with machetes in the hills of Los Angeles. That story line seemed false and offensive to a Latin American writer on the staff, as well as to the cast member Ms. Mendez, Ms. Edwards said. ""She felt that she could not in good conscience appear in the episode as written,"" Ms. Edwards wrote in the email to the producers. (Ms. Mendez didn't respond to requests for comment.) Mr. Spottiswood agreed to cut the machete subplot after he learned of Ms. Mendez's complaints.

After Mr. Nayar and Ms. Edwards left ""All Rise"" last year, Mr. Spottiswood held a meeting to discuss the tensions in the writers' room, said two people with knowledge of the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Two representatives from the Warner Bros. human resources department were present, as was Maria Rodriguez, a labor lawyer hired by the studio. Mr. Spottiswood grew emotional as he told the staff that he had failed them, the two people said. ""I acknowledge that I can have a rhetorical, professorial tone in the room, and that can be perceived by some as condescending, and that I can be defensive in creative conversations and debates,"" Mr. Spottiswood said in his statement. ""I remain strongly committed to improving my communication style and skills, and to being a more inclusive leader -- ensuring that writers and artists are not just heard, but feel listened to, respected, safe and valued."" Dee Harris-Lawrence, a Black woman who was the show runner of the OWN drama ""David Makes Man,"" was hired as a co-show runner in December, taking over Mr. Nayar's role on ""All Rise."" Ms. Edwards said that, in her view, Mr. Spottiswood had been allowed to remain in charge because his approach to race was a fit for CBS. ""He makes race palatable for a CBS audience and the CBS brass, because he doesn't know anything about it,"" she said. ""So there is this strange tone of nothing being said, but the visual representation is there. It's safe, and it's empty. All the reality is absent.""","Five have left the drama, whose white show runner, Greg Spottiswood, had disputes with the staff over its depictions of race and gender.

Fashion & Style,A Distant Husband Becomes Caretaker and Falls Madly in Love Again,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/fashion/weddings/a-distant-husband-becomes-caretaker-and-falls-madly-in-love-again.html,"George Shannon with his late wife, Carol Sue Shannon, in April 2012. Mrs. Shannon, who died in 2017, had two strokes in 2010. When he began the caretaking process, he said he ""began worrying less about me and more about her.""

Forty-one years into his marriage, George Shannon became better acquainted with a woman he once took for granted, and fell deeply in love with her. ""Such beautiful blue eyes and a great sense of humor,"" Mr. Shannon said. ""I loved her more, I respected her more and I wanted to be with her more."" They met in 1967 at a restaurant in the Pittsburgh area, where they both grew up. ""I was sitting with a friend and when we got up to leave I felt a tug on my sleeve,"" he recalled. ""When I looked over she handed me a slip of paper with her name and phone number on it, I guess she liked what she saw."" Mr. Shannon was not flattering himself and another woman at the expense of his wife, with whom he was married for 48 years, nor was he revealing an extramarital affair.

The woman with the blue eyes and the great sense of humor for whom he had a newfound, deeper respect was in fact his wife, Carol Sue Shannon, who died at age 70 in April 2017, seven years after suffering two strokes that led to myriad other physical setbacks and resulted in Mr. Shannon becoming her primary caretaker. It was an experience that became in essence a second tug on his sleeve, a chance to rejuvenate a marriage that he ""had not paid much attention to,"" he said, for the better part of four decades. Mr. Shannon, now 73, who retired as a vice president for Northeast sales at a Georgia-based company that maintained water quality for communities, sounded like a man drowning in sorrow when he talked about the cold, empty years of his marriage before becoming his wife's caretaker and rediscovering magic. ""Carol never complained about anything or asked for anything, and I took advantage of that by being selfish and self-centered,"" he said, pausing for a painful moment to clear his throat. ""Everything I wanted to do, I did without first asking what she thought about me doing it,"" he said. ""I'd say things like 'Carol, I'm going out to play golf,' or 'Carol, I'm going out drinking with some buddies,' and all she would ever say was 'that's fine.' She was always deferring to me because it was always all about me, but if I had to do it over again, I would certainly balance things a lot better."" Mr. Shannon said that before his wife had her first stroke in April 2010 on the final night of a vacation in Cabo, San Lucas, Mexico, they had ""a good relationship, though our love wasn't real deep.""

A month later she had a second, much more devastating stroke that drastically affected her speech and balance. She subsequently fell twice, which led to her breaking both hips, requiring surgery and a long rehabilitation. She would suffer yet another fall in which she broke a shoulder, and later had a heart attack that warranted triple-bypass surgery. ""Through all of those challenges she never lost her spirit, never lost her smile, and never complained,"" Mr. Shannon said. ""Whenever someone asked how she was feeling, she would simply say to them, 'I'm fine.'""

When he began the caretaking process, he said he ""began worrying less about me and more about her."" Mr. Shannon and his wife began growing closer and their feelings for each other intensified ""until it got to the point where we were madly in love again,"" he said. ""I felt humility for the first time in my life, my heart and soul opened up, and I could just feel that the special connection we once had was back again."" Lara E. Fielding is an adjunct professor of psychology at Pepperdine University and a psychologist in private practice in Beverly Hills who specializes in using mindfulness-based therapies to manage stress and strong emotions. She said the emotional transformations of Mr. Shannon and his wife during those last seven years of their marriage can be attributed to human nature. ""A tragedy such as illness can absolutely bring couples closer as they fight a common foe together,"" she said. ""We get closer when we find a space to be vulnerable together.""

""The usual day-to-day annoyances fall away,"" Dr. Fielding added, ""and we remember what really matters, and we grow united in what's most important."" Mr. Shannon still lives in Sewickley, Pa., a small town 13 miles outside of Pittsburgh, where he and his wife raised three sons, including Chad Patrick Shannon, 44, a lawyer turned writer who wrote with his father ""The Best Seven Years of My Life: The Story of an Unlikely Caregiver."" The self-published memoir was released in December. It chronicles the metamorphosis of a distant-to-doting husband. ""My dad was hard-driving and demanding both as a spouse and as a parent,"" he said. ""He was successful in business, but he was also this very serious, intense, Type-A personality who all of my high school friends were afraid of."" ""My mom loved my dad, but to be honest, he wasn't fully in love with her until those final seven years,"" he continued. ""But once he got there, he just wanted more and more of the true love they so enjoyed catching up on."" In the memoir, Chad Shannon described the moment when his father came to a crossroads in terms of making caregiving decisions for his wife that would relentlessly test his resolve, and hers. ""Most people's reaction to these circumstances would be to tumble into depression,"" he wrote. ""Life has dealt you a bad hand. You're boxed in. It would have been so much easier for George to find someone else to take care of her than to do it himself. Bring strangers into the house to offer round-the-clock care. Put Carol in a home. Take the easy way out. But that isn't George. Self-pity wasn't an option for him. If he ever felt sorry for himself, he never showed it. He was all in. When the relationship faced its drastic change, George totally accepted his fate and grew from it. He recognized anew that he was, as he puts it, 'terribly in love with this woman.' He found joy in a seemingly never-ending task that would buckle most of us at the knees.""","""I felt humility for the first time in my life,"" he said, ""my heart and soul opened up, and I could just feel that the special connection we once had was back again.""",a9f1d51d-5c21-5e29-9402-ff066e636a43,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/17/fashion/weddings/17caretaker1/17caretaker1-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=838b47302d9916e85f14884be65e1b330b4b1bf26c28cf9557c5d6933e4b06f5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"George Shannon with his late wife, Carol Sue Shannon, in April 2012.

Art & Design,Milton Glaser's Unseen Design for New York: 'Together',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/arts/design/milton-glaser-together-design-coronavirus.html,"Five weeks ago, I received a call from Milton Glaser. We'd never met, but he was kindly answering an email I'd sent his studio a few hours prior. At best, I expected a response from his assistant. Instead, I got a FaceTime Audio call from the 90-year-old graphic designer. The result was a conversation that ranged from the confounding nature of his success to the motivation for his latest project. It would be one of his last interviews before his death on Friday, his 91st birthday. Only a few weeks before our conversation, New York had hit its Covid-19 apex. The infection and death rates were slowing, but the city's future remained in question. My prompt to Mr. Glaser, and the impetus for my initial email, was simple: In this moment of despair, could some form of artistic expression -- similar to his 1977 ""I  NY"" logo, scratched out in the back of a taxicab -- help galvanize an ailing city? Mr. Glaser was already grappling with some version of the same question. In between dialysis, he had been working on a project he hoped to distribute to public school students across the city, and ultimately the country. It was a graphical treatment of the word ""Together."" ""There was no business plan,"" said Ignacio Serrano, Mr. Glaser's graphic designer and studio manager. ""It was about connecting people through art. He would use the example of, 'If you like Mozart and I like Mozart, we already have something in common. We have a bridge.'""

First, how have you been managing throughout the pandemic? Well, I'm in dialysis three days a week. I'm at a facility that basically takes care of all your needs and excludes the world. It's as though you're suspended in space. But I realize that the whole world is now suspended in space, so it's not so unusual. At the same time, I'm trying to acquire a new studio next door to a new apartment we bought. So that is the height of optimism, to buy a new apartment at the age of 90. Is it hard to do culturally relevant work, the type you're focusing on, while ""being excluded from the world""?

You still have the same issues as any design, which is effectiveness. And you still have to invent stuff out of your own psyche, and assume that people will be equally moved or challenged by the idea. I'm actually developing something I haven't shown to anyone, which is simply a treatment of the word ""Together."" What gave you the idea for ""Together""? When you watch television now it's so depressing. This sense of inertia, of not being able to determine your own future, it's very eroding. All we can do is have this sense that we are not alone. ""We're all in this together"" has been reiterated a thousand times, but you can create the symbolic equivalent of that phrase by just using the word ""together,"" and then making those letters [look] as though they are all different, but all related. So if you want to use the word ""together"" it evokes the entire phrase and the idea that we have something in common. What's absent from ""Together"" is an overt reference to New York, the city that's been the focus of much of your previous work. I did that in order for it to be universal in the same way that ""I  NY"" was. I want this identity to be adapted by others who are not New Yorkers. This is of course a world problem, not a New York problem. You developed the iconic ""I  NY"" logo in 1977, and revisited it after the attacks of Sept. 11 with ""I  NY More Than Ever."" Could ""Together"" have a similar impact?

Well, I've done a lot of work in my life, but nothing was as durable as ""I  NY."" For some reason, and it's a great mystery, that idea went all around the world. It hasn't disappeared into the pit of advertising material or sloganism, it's still all around. Particularly in advertising, we're in a cycle of a month per idea, and it's gone, and then there's something else to replace it. After all these years, I don't understand what it is that makes an idea compelling enough to move a person to a different perception. You're skeptical that your current project can have an impact, but you're still doing it? There must be some sense that it can break through. I have no idea. Actually, I'm surprised by how these pieces of art can affect people, and can affect their mood or attitude. Design starts with a desire to change an existing condition, but as I said, the shift is something you hope for, and most of the time don't get it. The ""I  NY"" logo started with a city commissioner coming together with an advertising agency. Would you like to see Mayor de Blasio or Governor Cuomo do more to engage the artistic community in this moment? Well, I think they don't understand the power of these ideas. And what they do is they hire perfectly competent people and agencies that specialize in professional work. And to some degree, this is not professional. It's quite the opposite. Professional work guarantees results, and this has no guarantee, but we hope it opens the heart. And so it's very hard to quantify and it's certainly very hard for a government to select people that it's comfortable with, who are also extraordinary. You need people who go beyond what is objective and what is logical. I suppose you have to call them artists.

You're a lifelong New Yorker. Is there something inherent in this city that will enable it to recover from the devastation of the pandemic? New York is full of diversity and complexity, and it's very hard to analyze because of that. New York is a mind-set, and we're all arrogantly proud of what that represents. The word they've used is toughness, but it's also a combination of cynicism and generosity. It's unprecedented anywhere in the world. So it really cannot be characterized as just another city, somewhere. It's a kind of self-contained universe, and by virtue of that, it makes decisions that other places don't. What advice would you give younger creatives, especially those who have been particularly active and engaged during this time? There's an odd combination of intuition and intelligence that has to be mustered to do this work. The part that is logical is only half the job. The other half is truly intuitive and comes out of some part of the brain that you can't control. It's the reconciliation of those two aspects that make things happen. But since the brain is an instrument that holds everything in the universe, it's there somewhere. Do you have any predictions as to how we come out of this moment?

Opinion,President of the Flies,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/27/opinion/trump-coronavirus-shipwrecks.html,"There we were, sailing through the uncharted waters of the early 21st century, when suddenly, our boat was dashed upon the rocks. The morning after the 2016 election I felt as if I'd washed up half-naked on some cruel and hostile strand, a strange country where people with disabilities were mocked, immigrants like my mother were reviled, and grabbing women by their private parts was apparently A-OK, at least if you were a celebrity. Where was this place I'd landed? Was I going to have to survive for the next four years on coconuts?

Now, three and a half years later, we know a little bit more about Donald's Island. Unemployment is at its highest since the Great Depression. About 100,000 Americans are dead -- as many as 36,000 of them perhaps because Mr. Trump refused to embrace a national policy of social distancing until it was too late. Before that, the president was impeached for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. As of April, The Washington Post estimated, he had made false or misleading claims to the citizens of this country 18,000 times.

Don't worry, though: In 2017 the richest among us got a big tax cut.

Is it any wonder that many Americans speak of their hope of deliverance from this administration with the same words you'd use if your plane had crashed onto Carnage Island? Who's going to rescue us? we wonder. Who's going to take us back to the place we once called home?

Tales of castaways often describe the tension between those who hope to recreate the civilized world (on the one hand) and those who see their marooning as an opportunity to start over (on the other). Some of these islands are places of idealism and fantasy; the Swiss Family Robinson, for example, use their time shipwrecked in the East Indies to perfect the arts of self-reliance, acceptance and cooperation. (They also tame a jackal, whom they name Fangs). At the end of the novel, when a British ship arrives, some of the characters decide they don't want to be rescued.

On other islands, things go all to hell. Sometimes this is because the castaways revert to their more primitive selves. Piggy in ""Lord of the Flies,"" for instance, implores his chums to trust in reason and in science, like a middle-school version of Dr. Anthony Fauci.

What Does That Mean?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/style/trump-women-dress-code-white-house.html,"But while many of the tweets were aimed at rejecting the idea that women should be restricted to some narrow sartorial category, the ""dress like a woman"" phrase, co-opted as a hashtag, didn't come directly from Mr. Trump.

In his newsletter, Mr. Allen attributed the phrase this way:

Trump likes the women who work for him ""to dress like women,"" says a source who worked on Trump's campaign. ""Even if you're in jeans, you need to look neat and orderly."" We hear that women who worked in Trump's campaign field offices -- folks who spend more time knocking on doors than attending glitzy events -- felt pressure to wear dresses to impress Trump.

In an email on Friday afternoon, Mr. Allen declined to offer any further details.

Theater,"In a Musical 'Death in Venice,' the Author Is Present",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/theater/death-in-venice-ivo-van-hove-nico-muhly.html,"AMSTERDAM -- At an Amsterdam rehearsal studio one recent afternoon, Thomas Mann, the German author who died in 1955, was speaking with the main character of his novella, ""Death in Venice."" ""I have to get out of here,"" said Gustav von Aschenbach, collapsing into a chair with his head in his hands. But Mann did not let him leave. Instead, he forced his character to stay in Venice, tormented by his obsession with a 14-year-old Polish boy, and to die there. In this new musical production of ""Death in Venice,"" created by the internationally renowned Belgian director Ivo van Hove, the author is present. Mann doesn't only converse with his protagonist, but also with his own wife, Katia, who watches from the sidelines as her husband also becomes increasingly distracted by the sight of the beautiful boy.

Premiering April 4, the production is a collaboration between the Internationaal Theater Amsterdam (formerly known as the Toneelgroep Amsterdam), which Mr. van Hove leads, and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. They have commissioned music by the American composer Nico Muhly, which will be interspersed between works by Richard Strauss, Anton Webern and Arnold Schoenberg, and conducted by David Robertson. The production will tour Europe from next year, with performances in London, Paris and Zagreb. ""We see Mann at home writing this novel, creating von Aschenbach, sending him to Venice, and having him meet a boy,"" explained Mr. van Hove, in a rehearsal break. ""It's to make clear that this wasn't just a story to Thomas Mann: It was something that he lived through."" Ramsey Nasr, who adapted the novella for the stage and plays Aschenbach, said in an email exchange that the idea of incorporating the real-life story of Thomas and Katia Mann into the drama was a way to explore how artists create fictions from their own lives. Katia described in her 1974 memoir, ""Unwritten Memories,"" how ""Death in Venice"" was based on a trip the two took to the city in 1911, when they stayed at the Grand Hotel des Bains on the Lido, and encountered many figures whom Mann used as models for his characters.

The boy who became Mann's muse was later identified as Wladyslaw Moes, the 10-year-old son of an aristocratic Polish family, in the 2001 book ""The Real Tadzio,"" by the Scottish journalist Gilbert Adair. When Mr. Nasr learned about this background to the novel, he said, ""It made me wonder: How was it for her to be there and witness it all?"" This gave him ""all the ingredients for a drama encapsulating the story,"" he added.

Katia, who outlived her husband by 25 years, was almost 90 when she finally revealed publicly how she had dealt with that chapter of their life together. ""She didn't talk about it for her whole life, really,"" said Mr. van Hove. ""She accepted that he had this in him but he turned it into novels and he turned it into poetry and into art."" ""Death in Venice"" is one of the most celebrated works of German literature, and it has been adapted as an acclaimed film by Luchino Visconti, in 1971, and as Benjamin Britten's final opera, which premiered in 1973. Mr. Muhly, a composer who has worked with Philip Glass and Bjork, has written new music for the production. In an interview, he said this ""Death in Venice"" was neither an opera nor a music theater piece, but rather ""a play with a lot of room for music."" The difficulty of adapting the novella for the stage is that the drama of the story largely takes place in Aschenbach's mind. Visconti reimagined Aschenbach as a composer and conductor (played by Dirk Bogarde) and used music by Mahler on the soundtrack to reflect Aschenbach's anguish.

Mr. Muhly said he knew Britten's opera ""incredibly well,"" and that it was a key reference point for his own opera ""Two Boys,"" which was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in 2013. But, he said, he had to ""not think about that at all. Instead, I was thinking about the text, I was thinking about the adaptation, and what Ivo's team has done to frame this text and to tell the story in different way."" Mr. van Hove has created three productions this season that concern what he called ""abusive forbidden relationships"": a stage adaptation of Hanya Yanagihara's novel ""A Little Life,"" which tells a story of a victim of pedophilia, and ""The Wood,"" a play adapted from a novel by Jeroen Brouwers, which portrays physical and sexual abuse in a Roman Catholic monastery and boarding school. ""It's very current, with what's coming out about the Catholic church and, coincidentally, this whole Michael Jackson thing,"" he said, referring to the new documentary ""Leaving Neverland,"" about child-abuse allegations against the pop musician. ""It's really something that people are talking about more and more. Thomas Mann wrote about the subject of desire. You cannot call it abuse; it's in someone's mind, but it's really a fantasy desire."" Mr. Robertson, who will lead the Concertgebouw for the production's Amsterdam run, cautioned against thinking of ""Death in Venice"" as primarily about homoerotic or pedophilic urges. The production was asking bigger questions, he added: ""Where does creativity come from? Where does love stem from, and what happens when love and creativity are blended together?"" Mr. Robertson said he thought the project was a wholly new take on Mann's story. ""This doesn't replace the novella, the film or the opera,"" he said. ""It augments this fantastic creation that Thomas Mann has made.""",A new production by Ivo Van Hove with a live orchestra makes the writer Thomas Mann a character in his most famous creation.,4b8f1bba-e05e-576b-97ce-65ff20beace0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/02/arts/02DEATHINVENICE/02DEATHINVENICE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=d234056dc287fda62392f539306cebb3ad32d9140cb9bc84db50801a04cecbcd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ramsey Nasr, standing, as Aschenbach and Achraf Koutet as Tadzio in a rehearsal for ""Death in Venice"" in Amsterdam.

Science,Scientists Find Form of Crispr Gene Editing With New Capabilities,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/04/science/rna-c2c2-gene-editing-dna-crispr.html,"Just a few years ago, Crispr was a cipher -- something that sounded to most ears like a device for keeping lettuce fresh. Today, Crispr-Cas9 is widely known as a powerful way to edit genes. Scientists are deploying it in promising experiments, and a number of companies are already using it to develop drugs to treat conditions ranging from cancer to sickle-cell anemia. Yet there is still a lot of misunderstanding around it. Crispr describes a series of DNA sequences discovered in microbes, part of a system to defend against attacking viruses. Microbes make thousands of forms of Crispr, most of which are just starting to be investigated by scientists. If they can be harnessed, some may bring changes to medicine that we can barely imagine. On Thursday, in the journal Science, researchers demonstrated just how much is left to discover. They found that an ordinary mouth bacterium makes a form of Crispr that breaks apart not DNA, but RNA -- the molecular messenger used by cells to turn genes into proteins. If scientists can get this process to work in human cells, they may open up a new front in gene engineering, gaining the ability to precisely adjust the proteins in cells, for instance, or to target cancer cells.

""The groundbreaking thing about this work is that it now opens up the RNA world to Crispr,"" said Oliver Rackham, a synthetic biologist at the University of Western Australia who was not involved in the study. Crispr was first discovered in 1987, but it took decades for scientists to figure out that microbes needed the system to recognize DNA from invading viruses and to chop it into pieces, stopping the infection.

In 2012, a team of scientists led by Jennifer Doudna of the University of California, Berkeley, and Emmanuelle Charpentier, then at Umea University in Sweden, discovered how to use this microbial defense as a gene-editing tool that could potentially alter any piece of DNA. Most of that early work was carried out with Crispr molecules from a species of bacteria that lives in human skin called Streptococcus pyogenes. Once those molecules proved effective at reassembling human DNA, a number of scientists began looking at other species for Crispr systems that might be even better.

Some researchers investigated familiar species that have been studied in labs for decades. But Eugene V. Koonin and his colleagues at the National Center for Biotechnology Information instead scoured databases containing hundreds of millions of genetic sequences for those that resembled Crispr genes. Once they discovered some candidates, they joined forces with Feng Zhang of M.I.T., who published one of the first studies on using Crispr to edit human DNA. One of the first candidates they looked at came from a species of bacteria that lives in the mouth, known as Leptotrichia shahii. It had a group of genes that looked like Crispr genes in some ways, but with stark differences. When the researchers equipped bacteria with these genes, which they called C2c2, they found that the organisms gained a defense that had never been seen. Many viruses do not contain DNA. Instead, their genetic information is encoded in RNA, DNA's single-stranded cousin, which they use to hijack the genes of their hosts and cause them to make new viruses. Some of these RNA viruses, such as H.I.V. and poliovirus, attack our species. Many others attack bacteria. Previously discovered Crispr molecules are very good at whacking apart DNA but don't protect bacteria from an RNA virus. Dr. Zhang and his colleagues discovered that bacteria with C2c2 make molecules that can attack RNA and chop it up, destroying the invaders. The researchers also found that they could tailor these genes to cut any RNA molecule they wanted. Now they are tinkering with the process to try to get it to work in human cells. ""There could be a lot of cool applications,"" Dr. Zhang said. He hopes, for example, that C2c2 molecules could be trained to destroy RNA made only in cancer cells. Those cells would be unable to make essential proteins and die.

While it remains to be seen if these will become useful tools, Dr. Koonin said, the discovery has already revealed something important about the evolutionary history of these microbial defenses. Some parts of C2c2 genes share a common evolutionary origin with the defense systems seen in other bacterial species. Over billions of years, Dr. Koonin said, evolution has blindly tinkered with these genes in order to generate new ways to protect against viruses. Exploring this evolution is more productive for now than trying to design gene-editing technology from scratch, Dr. Zhang said. ""We're not quite smart enough yet,"" he added. In fact, some future advances in gene editing may even not be based on Crispr. Microbes have evolved several different lines of defense against viruses, some of which are only now coming to light. In recent years, for example, scientists have discovered that microbes can use another group of proteins, called Argonautes, to chop up viral DNA. Last month, a team of Chinese researchers announced that they were able to use Argonaute proteins to edit DNA in human cells. Paul S. Knoepfler, a cell biologist at the University of California, Davis, is taking a wait-and-see attitude about Argonaute proteins, but he said he would not be surprised if they quickly turned out to be yet another powerful gene-editing tool. ""This field seems to move in dog years,"" he said. ""It feels like seven times faster than real time.""","A common bacterium contains molecules that target RNA, not DNA. If it can be harnessed for use in humans, the process may lead to new forms of bioengineering.",549c0202-1cac-5b19-a30a-18643f3c631f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/04/science/04ZIMMER/04ZIMMER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=89e95f412f3bed89d62b41702d70590f22ab00c640a305f1ff219ba095536878&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An electron micrograph of RNA polymerase molecules attached to DNA strands.

By  

329 pp. One World. $27.

""Some time ago -- never mind how long precisely -- I slipped off the map of the world,"" Dr. Voth, a transgender professor and the principal narrator of 's ""Confessions of the Fox,"" announces on the first page of this debut novel, in a hat tip to ""Moby-Dick."" The alternate world into which Voth slips is not a watery abyss but rather a ""living diorama of flesh worship,"" which he implores his reader to join. As cetology is to Melville, so quim (18th-century slang for female genitalia) is to Rosenberg. Quim's cognates -- tuzzy-muzzy, boiling Spot, monosyllable, Water-Mill -- are scattered through these pages, expanding conventional usage to ""signify any loved point of entry on the body, irrespective of gender or sex,"" a description of sorts of Rosenberg's novel.

How does Voth reach this utopia of the flesh? His journey begins when he stumbles upon a mysterious manuscript at a university book sale. The papers purportedly contain a true account of the life of the infamous jailbreaker Jack Sheppard. You may recognize Sheppard as Mack the Knife from Brecht's ""The Threepenny Opera,"" but with a few significant alterations: Jack is now transgender, and his London is no longer exclusively white and straight. Enter Bess Khan, a prostitute of South Asian descent who helps Jack realize his ambition as ""King Screwsman"" by encouraging his ever more daring heists -- like stealing from London's ruthless ""Thief-Catcher General,"" Jonathan Wild -- as well as his emerging queerness. ""A wonderful, fetching Something,"" Bess calls Jack, and it is through her physical intervention that Jack forges the body he is meant to have. What ensues is a picaresque adventure through a London rarely seen in literature of the period, one filled with sentinels and fear of plague but also with a thriving subculture of mollies (18th-century slang for queer men) and prostitutes and a celebratory aura of sexual freedom.

Jack's adventure may not be immediately accessible to all audiences. Voth informs the reader that his manuscript may only be decoded by someone who can ""cry a certain kind of tears,"" by which he means someone who has lived on the margins of society. Someone who also, I might add, enjoys queer theory, 18th-century frame narratives, prison abolition literature, Marxist historical readings, a surprisingly lengthy subplot involving a copy of Spinoza's ""Ethics"" and a running footnote hall of mirrors to rival Borges. Perhaps representative of the novel's aim is a marbled page midway through the book, a homage to ""Tristram Shandy."" Like Sterne's marbled page, Rosenberg's offers a key to his narrative. It serves primarily as a rebuttal to an indignity many transpeople have faced at some point in their lives: the intrusive gaze of a non-transperson eager to glimpse their genitals. This novel is an antidote to that gaze.","Jordy Rosenberg's debut novel, ""Confessions of the Fox,"" is a heady romp through an 18th-century England awash in sex, crime and revolutionary ideas.",c15831d8-0a85-56a7-b6cb-99f6ea6950cd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/29/books/review/29Conley/29Conley-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=3e0dcd235d93694dd8ce5777b95832bdff8d3ec68d8e2b9b8b70762fc87478ae&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Jordy Rosenberg,c15831d8-0a85-56a7-b6cb-99f6ea6950cd,N24News/imgs/c15831d8-0a85-56a7-b6cb-99f6ea6950cd.jpg,13
Theater,How Do You Stage Disney's 'Hercules'? Invite Everyone,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/theater/hercules-public-works-disney.html,"Rehearsing a Public Works show like the new ""Hercules"" is a logistical challenge given the size of the cast.



The world premiere adaptation of the 1997 animated film puts everyday New Yorkers -- 117 of them -- in the production at the Delacorte.

How Do You Stage Disney's 'Hercules'? Invite Everyone

When Alan Menken -- the songwriting virtuoso behind Disney's late 20th century animation renaissance -- was brought in to score an adaptation of ""Hercules,"" he assumed a classic story would call for some classic music to match. Instead, the directors of the 1997 film wanted gospel. ""I said, 'Really? Explain this to me, please,'"" Mr. Menken recalled in a phone interview. Hercules' epic journey to prove he's a hero involves quite a few Greek gods -- and gospel, they explained, is the music of praying to God. ""I go, 'Well, that's a stretch. But O.K. Let's play with it.'"" The resulting score became a cherished chapter in the Disney songbook. Now the songs are coming to life in a world premiere stage adaptation -- and Mr. Menken, along with lyricist David Zippel, is adding five more. But in a turn from Disney's typical theatrical adaptations -- commercial endeavors aimed at Broadway -- ""Hercules"" will be presented for free in a weeklong run at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park beginning Aug. 31.

Tickets for the show, directed by Lear deBessonet, will be distributed through a digital lottery. And unlike ""The Lion King,"" ""Aladdin"" and, most recently, ""Frozen,"" there are no plans for future productions, Mr. Menken said, on Broadway or otherwise. ""Hercules"" will be presented as part of Public Works, the Public Theater's annual end-of-summer event since 2013, which matches professional actors and community groups for streamlined productions that are part theater, part pageant -- and increasingly acclaimed and influential. Shakespeare has been the usual source material, though in 2015, Ms. deBessonet directed a musicalized take on ""The Odyssey."" Delving into a hero's journey, with an abundance of relatable themes for an abundance of actors, was fertile territory for the program.

""It seemed so nuts to imagine that the world premiere of 'Hercules' might be as a Public Works show, but I put it out there to him,"" Ms. deBessonet said. ""Obviously he knew how much I loved his body of work, and I just said, 'I think there could be this incredibly special realization of that story in this house that we've built.'"" Visiting one of Public Works' partner organizations, Ms. deBessonet saw the room light up when members started talking about Disney films. A love of those stories was something they all shared -- including Ms. deBessonet, who traces her affection for musical theater back to watching Disney cartoons as a child in Baton Rouge. Those musicals, she said, are a ""shared American canon."" That Disney superfan comes back out in Ms. deBessonet when she talks about the new songs from Mr. Menken and Mr. Zippel, which she called ""some of their best work."" ""It makes me cry,"" she said. ""It makes me dance. I squeal. ""

The ""Hercules"" classics that fans know and love will still be there: The Muses remain the story's narrators, setting up the premise with ""The Gospel Truth."" ""Zero to Hero"" -- ""possibly the most fabulous musical theater number known to humanity,"" Ms. deBessonet declared -- will still be a spectacle . And Hercules (Jelani Alladin) still promises to ""Go the Distance,"" only this time, with the added pressure of Roger Bart -- the original singing voice for Hercules in the film, who returns onstage as Hades -- listening in the wings.

In the new version, audiences can also expect a duet between Hercules and his headstrong love interest, Meg (Krysta Rodriguez) , and another ""Zero-to-Hero""-esque group number, ""Great Bolts of Thunder."" Mr. Menken's favorite addition is a song for the villain, a staple in other Disney musicals from the time period. With "" A Cool Day in Hell ,"" Hades at last gets his number. ""Hades is always blowing his top,"" Mr. Menken said. ""You know --"" ""You see the flames come out of his head, and then he takes two deep breaths and goes, 'O.K. I'm cool.' It's a little bit ... 'Walk on the Wild Side.'"" ... And many more performers. Poster-size sticky notes filled with more than a hundred faces and names, color-coded in eight neon shades, line the walls of Ms. deBessonet's Public Theater office. ""You basically have come into my war room,"" she said before rehearsal one evening, comparing the array to the ultimate Sudoku. Photographs of the ""Hercules"" ensemble -- community members from the five boroughs, ages 5 to 78 -- are categorized even further by role: the Fates, the Gods, a corps of puppeteers, various townspeople in ancient Greece.

And Ms. deBessonet's assignment is not just directing a run-of-the-mill musical. She and her team have the Herculean , you could say, task of coordinating a cast of 117 community members, eight professional actors, a featured dance group, a gospel choir and a high school marching band. (Not including, of course, the three parade-float-size Titan puppets, nor the five 60-foot-long Hydra heads that are ferried across Lafayette Street between the show's three downtown rehearsal spaces.) Before rehearsals began, her team sat down with a model of the stage and planned where every cast member could safely enter and exit each scene. Arrangements carry over offstage, too. Ms. deBessonet took the photos of two actors from one wall and held them up to a photo of a young girl, playing one of the all-seeing Fates. "" Isabelle Romero 's dad and little sister Maya are in the show as well, but they are in the Agora,"" she explained. ""So basically we have to figure out: When Isabelle needs to be rehearsing with Fates, how can we be sure that she has a ride home?"" Public Works engagements are a family affair for other ensemble members, who've returned year after year. Both Maddie Ramos and her 9-year-old daughter Noemi have been in the shows for six years. ""This is where she grew up,"" Ms. Ramos said. ""I consider these people my family. They're my joy."" Mr. Alladin, as a professional and a newcomer, has been swept up in the spirit. ""The community is playing the community,"" he said. ""The energy is so alive in the room because everyone wants to be there.""

Michael Roberts, a nonprofessional who is portraying Zeus, said it's meaningful that roles like his, and Mr. Alladin's, are played by black actors. ""When I see Zeus in the cartoon, I didn't see Zeus as me,"" he said. ""But I think that's what they're bringing to it -- anybody could go on the hero's journey. Everybody will find somebody that they can really watch and feel connected to."" In the rehearsal room two weeks before opening night, there was a distinct sense of unity among members of the ensemble as they stumbled through the show's first 12 minutes. Some were still glancing at the choreographers for assistance, or moving slightly off the beat -- but as each group finished running their part, the rest of the cast and crew erupted in encouraging applause. In a way, they were hammering home the exact message Ms. deBessonet wants to get across in the show.

Science,"Scott Kelly, American Astronaut, Returns to Earth After 340 Days in Space",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/science/scott-kelly-astronaut-nasa-space-station-return.html,"After 340 days in space, Scott Kelly is back on Earth. Mr. Kelly, who spent the time about 249 miles above the planet aboard the International Space Station, and the Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko landed on Tuesday at 11:26 p.m. Eastern in Kazakhstan. Mr. Kelly, in a bulky, white spacesuit, pumped his fist and smiled as he was helped out of his space capsule.

From Kazakhstan, Mr. Kelly will travel to Houston. He is scheduled to arrive at 11:45 p.m. Wednesday, and will be greeted by NASA officials; Jill Biden, the wife of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; and his identical twin brother, Mark Kelly, also an astronaut.

Scientists will study Mr. Kelly for the health effects of extended space travel, expecting it to be a steppingstone for a potential trip to Mars. They will have an unusual partner in the research: His twin will also be analyzed. If you're waiting to hear Scott Kelly's perspective on the experience, you'll have to be patient a little while longer. He won't address the news media until 2 p.m. Friday. NASA scientists will answer questions on Reddit at 11 a.m. that day, and the agency will also hold a news conference to discuss research accomplishments at 1 p.m.

Mr. Kelly has documented much of his trip on his Instagram and Twitter accounts, which became popular largely because of his distant views of Earth and its otherworldly sunrises and sunsets (he witnessed 10,880 of them). On Day 141, he posted a spectacular video of the aurora borealis.

Combined with his other three trips to space, Mr. Kelly has now spent 540 days of his life in orbit. The 340-day stay far surpassed the previous American record -- 215 days -- set by Michael Lopez-Alegria in 2006 and 2007. The international record is nearly 438 days, set by the Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov on the Mir space station in 1994 and 1995. ""I could go another year if I had to,"" Mr. Kelly said last week in a wide-ranging news conference. He was looking forward to jumping in his pool, he said, adding that the hardest part was being away from friends and family. But Mr. Kelly managed to maintained a sense of levity, including dressing up in a gorilla suit. Highlights of the trip included a spacewalk and enjoying the first lettuce grown and harvested in space.

Fashion & Style,Sterling Ruby Adds Fashion Designer to His Résumé,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/13/fashion/sterling-ruby-pitti-uomo-mens-wear.html,"FLORENCE, Italy -- Although Sterling Ruby can hardly be considered new to fashion -- thanks to his longstanding collaboration with Raf Simons at Dior and, later, at Calvin Klein -- until now he has never called himself a designer.

That all changes on Thursday when the prodigious multidisciplinary artist, best known for his gargantuan post-apocalyptic ceramic vessels, debuts his first full line of clothing, called S.R. Studio. LA. CA., with a runway show held in former royal stables on the perimeter of the Boboli Gardens.

Mr. Ruby pointedly avoided journalistic contact as he prepared for his presentation in Florence, where he is a special guest of the Pitti Uomo men's wear trade show. But a sneak peek at his collection showed that, even as he forayed into a new discipline, the artist retained familiar elements both of his folk-industrial aesthetic and the autobiographical nature of a wide-ranging artistic practice informed by some of the tidbits listed below:

1. Mr. Ruby, 47, has always sewed. His Dutch-born mother taught him during his high school years in rural New Freedom, Pa., where he was the oddball teen with patches on his jacket; the one whom, as he once said, ""the other kids would just pick apart.''","The multidisciplinary artist is introducing his first full collection of clothing in a runway show in Florence, Italy.",8204d332-9512-5c87-acd1-571d18b6027b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/13/fashion/13STERLINGRUBY-INYT-ruby/13STERLINGRUBY-INYT-ruby-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=3c42494ade81f4ce650f69ef2272559edeff4aa344d58985b6f83fe0bbae7794&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sterling Ruby will introduce his first fashion collection at the Pitti Uomo trade fair in Florence, Italy.",8204d332-9512-5c87-acd1-571d18b6027b,N24News/imgs/8204d332-9512-5c87-acd1-571d18b6027b.jpg,19
Movies,'Beanpole' Review: The War Has Ended. Their Fight Is Endless.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/movies/beanpole-review.html,"The war is over in ""Beanpole,"" at least officially. The hollow eyes of those crowding the hospital tell a different story, as do the faces of those drifting through a communal building, spilling through the streets and onto trams. But like the thin young nurse nicknamed Beanpole, the men and women in this startling movie don't complain or even speak much about their suffering, perhaps because it would be like describing the air that they breathe.

Set in Leningrad in 1945, ""Beanpole"" opens on its title character (Viktoria Miroshnichenko) in mid-seizure, her body frozen, open eyes fixed and breathing labored. Other women, similarly dressed in white, bustle around her, their voices muffled. From a slightly high angle, the camera steadily holds on her face as she stares into nothingness. Then someone stretches a hand up to pinch her cheek, trying to rouse her and bring her back to the dimly lit present. Beanpole, whose real name is Iya, is taller than everyone else in the room, taller than almost everyone. She sways far above this world, even when it claws at her.

Most war movies are about battle; ""Beanpole"" is about what happens afterward. For Beanpole, a hospital nurse, the clamor of war has quieted to an unremitting throb. At work, she cares for soldiers whose bandages and missing limbs are only the most obvious expressions of collective trauma. The pain is everywhere. Early on, when Beanpole can't secure a babysitter, she brings her boy, Pashka (Timofey Glazkov), into the soldiers' ward. As this painfully small child stands before the attentive, visibly moved men, his tiny, malnourished frame -- embodying such unspeakable loss -- seems to fill the ward.

Something terrible happens soon after, and while it's almost unbearable, you should hang on. This is only the second feature from the sensationally talented Russian director Kantemir Balagov (who was born in 1991), and it's a gut punch. It's also a brilliantly told, deeply moving story about love -- in all its manifestations, perversity and obstinacy -- one that starts to take shape when Beanpole's friend Masha (a fantastic Vasilisa Perelygina) returns to Leningrad, medals pinned to her uniform. Inside Beanpole's claustrophobic flat, with its peeling paint and stained wallpaper, they circle each other, trying to find equilibrium where there is none.","Set in the aftermath of World War II, this dazzling movie centers on two friends who are each casualties of a historical trauma.",37153b41-88f8-5a00-a851-e34836877160,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/29/arts/28beanpole-1/28beanpole-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=40eaf64b3a3c528c8696858bd4ff3cb04aea7d638c26e0b48d77452cd51522f9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Vasilisa Perelygina, left, and Viktoria Miroshnichenko in &ldquo;Beanpole.&rdquo;",37153b41-88f8-5a00-a851-e34836877160,N24News/imgs/37153b41-88f8-5a00-a851-e34836877160.jpg,5
Style,"The Unsung Heroes of Fashion, Now Mostly Unemployed",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/04/style/couture-workers-fashion-coronavirus.html,"In a pre-coronavirus world, hundreds of editors, clients, stylists and celebrities would have converged on Paris this weekend, clacking over the cobblestones in their kitten heels for the couture shows. Those singular displays of fashion art -- handmade clothes custom-ordered by the very few -- represent equal parts creative laboratory, artisanal expertise and visual extravaganza. For many, they are also a major employment opportunity. You may see models in gowns on Instagram, and hear of the famous names responsible for the updos and cat eyes, but making that perfect 20 minutes happen also demands an army of independent contractors, largely unknown. And, now that the shows have gone digital, largely unemployed. Here, a scattering of these men and women describe their lives in the absence of shows. They are but a fraction of the lighting technicians, manicurists, photographers, caterers, florists, drivers, security guards, seamstresses, dressers and musicians whose labor creates the dream. These interviews have been edited.

""I've worked with the hairstylist Sam McKnight as part of his freelancer team for 13 years. Usually I'm a director for a group of hair salons in and around London, but whenever Sam has been booked for a fashion show, then off I go to that city, be it for cruise, couture or ready-to-wear. There are probably around 40 stylists on Sam's backstage team at a fashion show. We come from all over the world to work in Paris for couture. Often, for the biggest shows, you work in pairs on one model with a stylist and a 'watcher,' who makes sure the look is absolutely perfect and to the specifications of Sam or the brand. Until you reach the very top, you don't do it to make money. You do it for career experience with Sam and out of love for the theater of fashion and being a part of it all. It is only after you establish yourself over many years that you make any cash. But for me it has been worth it for the experiences I've had. I still pinch myself. We do all the Chanel couture shows, of course, which are always very special. And last July, for the Fendi couture show in Rome that paid tribute to Karl Lagerfeld, we color-coordinated wigs to each of the clothes for the finale, which just looked spectacular. But this year, there is nothing at all.

In what would have been couture, I'll be thinking about what might happen in terms of physical shows in September. For whatever events take place, security -- and maintenance of new safety regulations -- will be more important than ever before. Whatever happens, we will do what we always do: Get the job done."" ""I have worked with Stephane for 20 years. We are known for our large, extravagant bouquets. We usually work with around 10 to 12 people, although during show time, that usually goes up to 25 to 30. Fashion weeks together are a huge part of our year. Maybe 40 to 45 percent of our annual business if you put all six together. For us, couture week is very intense. We could be doing the flowers in Mademoiselle Chanel's apartment in the morning, then for the Lutetia hotel, then a dinner for a brand. Or Chanel calls and says they want 100 bouquets of flowers delivered to clients who are coming to their show in the next 24 hours. And maybe they want only white roses one season. Or another brand wants only pink roses. I will normally start my day at 4 a.m. at the market, buying the flowers.

How long have you been doing makeup? I started in 2003. Then, in 2005, I got very lucky and met Pat McGrath, and she brought me along to do the makeup for a Galliano show. It was so creative, such an exciting time. Then I started doing shows for Milan and Paris fashion weeks, and that led to me getting an agent. How big a part of your business are the shows? I do ad campaigns and magazine shoots, but the shows are such a big thing here in Paris. Because it's not just the catwalks, it's also all the V.I.P.s that fly in for them. During couture, I might have three clients call me in a single day to do their makeup to go to a show, or an event after a show, and then the next day I will be backstage for the couture. I also get last-minute calls to fill in for other makeup artists, and then I just hop on my scooter, and the next thing, I am on the other side of Paris, getting Cindy Bruna, the French model, ready for an after-party, or Golshifteh Farahani, the Iranian-French actress. I generally work with Peter Philips now during show time. In January, we did Dior and Viktor & Rolf.

How does this compare to your normal professional life? My work is generally up and down -- I don't work every day, but during shows I do. For some shows, I might have to arrive at 5 a.m. to get the models ready, and then that night, I might have to get a private client ready for a dinner. The only other time that's remotely comparable, where I might have four jobs in one day, is the Cannes Film Festival. For three months, everything stopped. I was lucky, because as a self-employed person, I qualified for the government assistance. They gave everyone 1,500 euros [about $1,700] if they had lost 70 percent of their income, and I lost 100 percent. Ad campaigns that were postponed during lockdown are happening, and since no one can fly in, they are asking local teams. And we are lucky, in that clients have not used the excuse of Covid to lower the rates. I had an option on a video that one of the brands was going to do instead of a couture show, but it didn't work out. The problem with the videos is they involve very small teams. They really only need one artist, or maybe one and an assistant, whereas a show like Dior might use up to 40 makeup artists. So it's a big loss for my income. And also my creativity. What do you mean, creativity? What I miss most, I think, is watching the creative process of a show, because that inspires me a lot, especially when it comes to trends for the next season. And I miss my colleagues.

""I had a cleaning company with my wife for 20 years, but at the end of last year we split up, and I founded an eco-cleaning company. We are responsible for cleaning the whole venue wherever a show is held: floors, windows, walls. Everything. And because so many shows are in strange, industrial places, or building sites under construction, it can be very dirty, very dusty and very complicated. With my wife, we used to do Chanel in the Grand Palais, and we would start two weeks before the show, with two people cleaning. On the day of the show we would have up to 12. In January, for my first season on my own, we did Dior, YSL, where the whole set was an enormous white rug -- I made about 80,000 [about $90,000] euros that season, and I was budgeting 120,000 to 150,000 euros for men's and couture in July, assuming we would do seven or eight shows in each week. We are still getting a little work because some brands are doing photography or video, and also because everyone is very scared about safety, but it is much, much less. So now I am planning for only 15,000 to 20,000 euros this season. I feel lucky because I only have one person on staff. Otherwise we would really be in trouble.""

You help create invitations for some of the biggest shows. But this summer, there are no shows. It's a nightmare. Because it's not even the shows -- you have all the parties and all the buyers' presents, and all the events. Normally how many invitations do you address in one day? It depends on the material, the papers -- or I can have the leather used by Rick Owens, and that's super-hard, or the glass used at Margiela. So it depends, but you can have something like 2,000 in one day. I have around 60,000 by fashion week. We are waiting for the buyers. If we do not have any buyers, fashion shows cannot be done. At the same time, all the communications directors for the maisons are super-confident. They call and tell me: 'You're part of the family.' That's why I'm still positive.

Usually, this time of year would be so busy. I would pattern-cut at least three looks for the collection and complete at least one of those dresses myself. In January, I made a mousseline green plisse gown that looked simple, but every stitch was so technically challenging. I am not complaining, though. I love what I do. I still remember walking into the Dior atelier for the very first time. It was like a dream come true. Some people dream of Chanel, others of Givenchy, but not me. It was always Dior. Some of my friends have been working at Chanel on a very reduced couture collection and on client orders made in January. Now, all those pieces are ready for fittings. But none of the clients are able to travel. I have some money saved, but I am taking stock now. I have always loved the flexibility of being a freelancer. I have turned down studio jobs and fixed contracts at other houses as generally you don't make as much money. But if things don't change in another few months, I may have to reconsider -- if there are even jobs.",Security guards. Musicians. Florists. Drivers. They make the magic happen.

Books,A Forgotten 1950 Classic by Ludwig Bemelmans Brings New York to Life,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/05/books/review/ludwig-bemelmans-sunshine-a-story-about-the-city-of-new-york.html,"A brownstone owned by a bad-tempered elderly landlord named, oddly even for Bemelmans, Mr. Sunshine, has two rooms to let, with a ferocious set of limitations on their letting. (""Artists, acrobats or players/Traveling salesmen or soothsayers./To all those and sundry I say/Thank you kindly, go away!"") They are taken eventually by Miss Moore, a sweet old lady of the generic kind once played by Josephine Hull in the movies who turns out to be not just a music teacher but one who assembles and instructs a student orchestra. Threatened with eviction by an irate Sunshine, she is saved in a somewhat counterdramatic twist by the conditions of her lease (music, Sunshine's lawyer says, ""does not disturb the peace"") -- only to find herself deeply in debt not long after, owing to a misunderstanding at an auction house that leads her into the possession of 2,000 lost umbrellas, which then must be sold to save the final day, bringing chastened landlord and musical tenant together again -- as sweet a reunion as that of religious disputants in the Middle Ages.

The splendid cover of the book shows New York from the Staten Island Ferry, caught in the darkest of rain squalls, with Liberty herself holding one of Miss Moore's umbrellas in place of her lamp. This rain, which continues to fill the book's pages, one after another, though urged on by the purposes of the story, seems essential to its intended emotional effect, so much so that one wonders if the ""look"" preceded the telling.

Habitues of Bemelmans's one mural-masterpiece, the Bemelmans Bar at the Carlyle Hotel on Madison Avenue, will already have noted that the tonality with which Bemelmans evokes New York is markedly different, and far murkier, than the one with which he evokes Paris. His New York is cop-on-the-beat blue and brownstone brown, all shellac-and-resin musty, where his Paris is liquid and singing (or, at worst, violet-gray in winter). His Paris is made of light and clouds; his New York of shadows and snowfall -- shadows cast from buildings and the then extant elevated trains, to be sure, but as much a function of mystery and mood as descriptive exactitude. In the one rare, sunshine-filled scene in ""Sunshine,"" when the children musicians rush toward the brownstone, instruments in hand, Bemelmans shows us, almost perversely, that he can also properly capture the bright, Italianate yellow light of a New York afternoon. (His contemporary and friend Saul Steinberg used to sigh and point out that New York was on a line with Naples, not London, and that its light when seen in sunshine was essentially Mediterranean.)

The endpapers of the book are particularly splendid. They show New York Harbor again, now in snowfall, seen from the Brooklyn side, with the Manhattan skyline evoked behind the flecked snow in gray and burnt orange silhouette, and a firefighter's Dalmatian in the foreground loping toward Engine Co. 21. The scene, in its serenity and energy, sums up Bemelmans's New York. Where his Parisians tend to pose in pride, his New Yorkers lean into rain and weather; they shelter from storms more often than they promenade in, well, sunshine, and their lives are made of many purposes. New York for Bemelmans is a refuge more than an Eden, a city where one fights for space, music, meaning and even room for a Dalmatian.

If this welcome reappearance of ""Sunshine"" signals the beginning of a Bemelmans revival, perhaps someone can be persuaded to reissue his masterpiece for grown-ups, the 1948 travel book ""The Best of Times,"" which offers a memorable account of a trip back to Europe right after the war, with splendid full-page scenes sharing everything from the Matissean imagery of rugs on a Paris hotel stair to the look on a waiter's face at the reopened Maxim's to the darkest imaginable imagery of Dachau. In the meanwhile, ""Far More Than Madeline"" seems a fair codicil to add to Bemelmans's too single-minded legacy.

Real Estate,A City Perch for a Reverse Commuter,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/realestate/the-hunt-a-city-perch-for-a-reverse-commuter.html,"LAST fall, Alfredo Sosa-Velasco landed happily in New York as a visiting scholar at New York University. He was provided with a furnished studio with a balcony, for $1,275 a month, in Washington Square Village, the university-owned housing complex. When his yearlong program was almost up, Mr. Sosa-Velasco, who received a Ph.D. in Romance studies from Cornell University, was thrilled to be offered a position teaching Spanish language and literature at Southern Connecticut State University in New Haven. ""If you want to be in New York,"" he said, ""you have to be willing to do the commute, because getting a job in New York is very difficult.""

He showed up at an open house for a studio at a co-op on East 88th Street, listed at $275,000, with a monthly maintenance in the mid-$600s. That apartment, with plenty of sun and a brick wall, was nice inside except for the narrow shower. The studio wasn't for him, but there he met Morgan Turkewitz, an agent at Citi Habitats, and decided to search with her. At that point, Mr. Sosa-Velasco knew little about the New York market. ""After talking with him, I knew he needed some guidance,"" Ms. Turkewitz said, ""so I sent him some first-time buyer's information."" When she informed him it could take four to six months to buy a place, he was aghast. ""My first thought was, this is impossible,"" he said. After all, he had friends who had bought homes elsewhere and had closed the deal within a week, he said.

His price range was up to $270,000 and he planned to make a down payment of 10 percent. ""I thought the percentage was kind of negotiable,"" he said. ""I didn't think it was established by the co-op."" After all, some friends had put down a mere 3 percent elsewhere. Ms. Turkewitz informed him that, though some co-ops allow a 10 percent down payment, many require at least 20 percent. ""It is not a negotiable thing,"" she said. It wasn't negotiable with him, either, so from the start, they limited their explorations to cat-friendly buildings that would accept 10 percent down. One possibility was a one-bedroom on the ground floor on East 98th Street. The asking price was $259,000, with maintenance in the high $500s. Mr. Sosa-Velasco liked the convenience of the location but not the long, skinny layout and lack of light. The place remains for sale at $229,000. But two more possibilities arose in a small walk-up building filled with studios, each with a little more than 400 square feet. The building, in the East 80s, allowed cats but not dogs.

One of the studios appealed to Mr. Sosa-Velasco. Facing the back of the building, it was listed at $264,000, with maintenance in the low $700s. He especially liked the bathroom, which had a windowed nook perfect for Rafael's litter box. He worried about timing. He had a firm departure date for his N.Y.U. housing, and he didn't want to rent, having calculated that renting was more expensive than buying. ""I was, like, what am I going to do with the cat?"" he said. He could always crash with friends, but he didn't know ""if Rafael would scratch their furniture or something like that. I wouldn't have put my friends in that situation."" The co-op board met just in time, however, and allowed Mr. Sosa-Velasco to buy the place for $250,000. He closed in late summer, exactly four months after he met Ms. Turkewitz. He was impressed that she had accurately predicted his apartment-hunting timetable. ""I learned so much about real estate in New York City,"" he said, ""I could get the real estate agent license."" Mr. Sosa-Velasco had his floors polished and walls painted, and replaced the old kitchen appliances.

He had never before owned furniture, so he splurged at Ikea. Everything in the apartment is new, from silverware to scratching post. ""I assembled furniture like crazy,"" he said, doing most of it himself except for the bed and the large mirrored wardrobe. Even with the help of friends, these projects took two days. ""The apartment looks completely different from the time that I bought it,"" he said. At some point he plans to redo part of the kitchen, which has a strange double sink that consumes the limited counter space. The shopping situation in his new neighborhood, with its many large retailers, is especially convenient. In the Village, he found himself going from store to store. There, ""the shopping was much more individualized or specialized,"" he said. ""It was more trips that you had to take."" And now he finds that ""something subconscious"" seems to be at work: ""Whenever I go out, I want to buy something for the apartment."" He doesn't mind his long commute, which he makes three or four days a week. A monthly train ticket costs $415. On school days, he usually rises at 5:30. By 6:30, he is heading to the subway, bialy and coffee in hand. The subway leg is one stop on the express.

Art & Design,JR's Street Gallery Comes Indoors,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/11/arts/design/jr-brooklyn-museum.html,"JR with a new composite artwork, ""The Chronicles of New York City,"" at the Brooklyn Museum. He is often categorized as a street artist, but he said his abiding interest is people, and connecting them.

At the Brooklyn Museum, his pictures skim the surface of social problems. It can be a frustratingly reductive vision of world peace. ""I think being naive is what has helped me the most,"" he says.

On a fall day at the Brooklyn Museum, it was hard for JR, the most recognizable anonymous artist in the world, to go more than a few steps without a wave of double takes and a trail of enthusiastic fans. JR, who is 36 and was born in France, has been in the public sphere for at least a decade, yet still declines to give his full name and insists on appearing in public in a fedora and semi-rimless sunglasses, a bit of schtick that can make him look like he's stepped directly out of a Godard film. This persona, combined with his work -- monumental public photography projects often made in parts of the world wrenched by political strife or made inaccessible by military conflict -- has lent JR the aura of an empathetic Houdini, magicking himself into unkind places and performing the dual trick of not getting killed while stirring warm feelings. ""JR: Chronicles,"" his largest solo museum exhibition to date, tracks his by now well-documented actions from the Gaza Strip and the slums of Southern Sudan and Sierra Leone, to more recent work in the United States. Because his art is centered on portraiture and involves wheat-pasting oversize prints on building exteriors -- the faces of women in Rio's favelas splashed across their homes, or disembodied eyes in Havana, Istanbul and Los Angeles -- JR is usually categorized as a photographer or a street artist, but neither really gets at his abiding interest, which is people, and connecting them. ""I don't really like the term 'street art,'"" he said as we walked through the exhibition. ""My studio was the street for a lot of years, just because I had to install my work anywhere I could, and I didn't know anything else. For me it's art whether it's inside or outside. Sometimes it doesn't work in a gallery. ""

JR doesn't give away much about his past, aside from saying his parents emigrated from Tunisia and Eastern Europe and that he grew up in one of the ""stable"" banlieues outside Paris. When he was a teenager he would travel into the city center to write graffiti, using the tag JR, his real initials, or FACE 3, from his short-lived career as a D.J., until he realized he wasn't good at either pursuit. ""I learned the climbing, I learned all the other stuff, except being a good writer,"" he said. By his own admission, his art career began in near complete ignorance. ""I came from an environment where there was no art at all. I didn't know Keith Haring or Basquiat or Cartier-Bresson. I didn't know there was a job of being an artist. The narrative of other people has always been more interesting to me than mine."" He shifted to documenting his friends' talents, and pasting photocopies of his pictures of them on walls, complete with spray-painted frames and the heading ""Expo 2 Rue,"" for street gallery.

His first formal project, ""Portrait of a Generation,"" from 2004, featured close-ups of young people living in public housing in the Parisian suburbs of Montfermeil and Clichy-sous-Bois. JR asked them to make exaggerated faces, then pasted the images around the bourgeois neighborhoods of Paris. They're playful but also confrontational, prodding at the conceptions of working-class immigrants in these communities as menacing. The portraits took on added gravity in the next year, as rioting by youths pointing to police abuse and inequality spread from Clichy, and JR's pasted pictures became the background to burning cars. ""JR: Chronicles"" opens with a wall-size print of the French-Malian filmmaker Ladj Ly pointing a camera like a shotgun, a sly subversion of media portrayals of black men, but also the kinetic potential of images and the idea that social injustices could be remedied simply by making them widely visible, something that suggests JR's working thesis.

Since then, JR has viewed his projects as correctives to durable stereotypes and incomplete characterizations of people who traditionally lack the representation to object. ""What's interesting is if you talk to a woman in Brazil and a woman in Palestine, you realize that often they have the same point of view: that they're being misportrayed and they want to change that,"" he said. JR's practice retains much of the graffitist's instincts and moral center: the guerrilla application, the anti-authority ethos, the elevation of those shunted to the margins. ""For me it's really clear,"" he said. ""I was writing my names on walls to say 'I exist,' then I started pasting pictures of people with their names to say they exist. I feel safe when I see graffiti because it shows there's life. When you go to countries and there's not one single tag on the wall, you should be stressed.""

He doesn't spend a lot of time discussing the technical aspects of his work. ""Who cares if the photo is good or not good?"" he said. He's much more animated in retelling what happens after an image is pasted up and people start congregating and talking. The portrait is a provocation, an effective vehicle, but you get the sense he would happily switch to nautical flags or pottery if he knew those would take. The point is to get people to see each other, which for JR is the simplest route to understanding. It can feel daunting to take in so many faces, each with its own history and struggle. But JR is all tightly coiled energy, bopping around the gallery, arms tracing connections in the air. He's a gifted talker, but often, to punctuate a point he's making, he'll stab at your shoulder or jolt your arm. Aware both of his medium's built-in ephemerality and a keen sense of self-promotion, he has been a consistent self-documenter from the beginning. Each of his interventions is accompanied by a short film, either made on the fly, or as his resources became more robust, with sophisticated production and a narrative assist from Robert De Niro.

For awhile, JR operated just at the outer edges of the art world, making a fairly straightforward but mostly unimpeachable kind of human interest photography that boosted empathy for his subjects. But in the last few years, under the representation of Perrotin -- a global player that also represents blue- chip artists like Takashi Murakami and KAWS -- produced gallery shows and the attendant sales, his work has invited institutional consideration, and criticism. There's the knock that his persona feeds a mystique that gives his art a thrust it may otherwise not enjoy or deserve. JR defends his pseudonymous identity less for its performative affect than as a useful tool in a hostile reality.

""We live in a global world, but in most of the countries I go to no one knows me,"" he said. ""In Turkey or at the Mexican border, I would be stopped before I even started. I've been arrested in a lot of countries. The day that art is welcomed the same way everywhere, I guess I wouldn't need this,"" he says, gesturing to his camouflage. ""You know, it's kind of annoying to wear sunglasses all day."" JR's obvious analogue is Banksy, whose guerrilla art and success in remaining beguilingly anonymous have yielded eight-figure auction results. ""For years I would be like that, completely covered,"" JR said. ""But I realized by not talking about the work, people would not understand the complexity of it, the layers. It implicates people, and so I wanted people to understand the subject's intention."" As his projects have evolved in complexity and reach, they've become a shorthand for the kind of citizen-of-the-world pluralism and inextinguishable optimism that can be hard to separate from naivete. ""Chronicles"" includes JR's most recent project, ""The Chronicles of New York City,"" a large-format mural featuring 1,128 people, whom JR and his team photographed and interviewed by way of a 53-foot-long trailer truck studio that trawled the five boroughs last summer. It's the third in a series of Diego Rivera-style frescos, after a similar project in San Francisco, and a 2018 Time magazine and JR commission that took as its subject this country's gun control debate.","At the Brooklyn Museum, his pictures skim the surface of social problems.

Travel,It's Primary Season in New Hampshire. Time to Go Skiing!,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/travel/new-hampshire-primary-ski.html,"Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and a Democratic presidential candidate, following a town hall meeting at the North Conway Community Center. The afternoon event left time for skiing in the morning.





The day dawned sunny and clear and I knew New Hampshire's Mount Washington, white with snow, would loom brilliantly in the blue sky, so I packed my skis and headed north -- past the rock-climbing headquarters where, in 2004, I heard Dick Gephardt appeal for votes; through the famous covered bridge in Jackson, the backdrop of so many campaign advertisements; and up the hill past the Christmas Farm Inn, where Barbara Bush, campaigning for her husband's re-election in 1992, was so settled in her comfy bed that when the night clerk told her there was a call at the front desk, she said through the locked door that she would call the President of the United States back in the morning. My destination was Black Mountain, the fustiest and most unreconstructed ski area in New Hampshire's White Mountains. The lodge -- Dartmouth green and white -- was as I had remembered it from my childhood, cozy and compact, the beams exposed not as an affect but because when it was built the construction crew left them that way. Here the cafeteria offered a BLT and a whoopie pie. This was going to be a day when winter and America would be at their best.

Mine was just the fifth car in the parking lot, in part because the skiing is best when you make the first tracks, but also because you have to get going early if you're going to ski and see two presidential candidates in one day without breaking a winter sweat. (That afternoon I caught former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts greet older North Conway voters in his quixotic campaign to defeat President Trump in the Republican primary and the entrepreneur and Democratic candidate Andrew Yang speak to a raucous crowd in the small city of Rochester.)

This is the virtually unknown and uncelebrated aspect of New Hampshire and its first-in-the-nation presidential primary: It actually is possible for lovers of skiing and politics to combine their two favorite sports. As someone who has covered 12 of the past 13 New Hampshire primaries for a series of newspapers, including The Times, I speak from experience. In truth, you don't really have to get up early to mix the outdoor sport of skiing with the indoor game of politics in the weeks before the primary, which this year is scheduled for Feb. 11. Sometimes the two are right outside your ski lodge. The morning after my Black Mountain outing, I skied at North Conway's fabled Cranmore Mountain, then simply popped nine-tenths of a mile down the road to see Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., speak to a standing-room-only crowd at North Conway's Community Center. Perhaps it was only a coincidence that Mr. Buttigieg's event was next door to the New England Ski Museum. ""This is part of why New Hampshire is so unusual,'' the former Gov. John H. Sununu told me. ""Our voters work hard at knowing all these candidates and they work hard at skiing in our White Mountains.''

I'm not alone in spending primary season in New Hampshire. A 2016 study from the U.S. Travel Association found that for the past five contests, the average hotel occupancy was more than 78,000 nights higher for the year preceding the primary than in years when there is no primary, accounting for nearly $9 million in hotel revenue. Some people even come on package tours devoted to the primary. Skiing and politics have long been intertwined in New Hampshire. Mr. Sununu, who stopped skiing only when he turned 79, was the second governor of the state to be named White House chief of staff. He served George H.W. Bush a third of a century after Dwight D. Eisenhower selected Sherman Adams for the same role.

Mr. Adams founded Loon Mountain ski area, in Lincoln, after his White House years, when his wife, impatient with having him hanging around the house, pointed to the mountains and said, ""There must be a place to ski up there somewhere."" For years, in red-and-white knee socks and a fur cap, he plied the trails at Loon while she ladled out hot chocolate in the lodge. Senator Robert F. Kennedy helped Tom Corcoran, a star Dartmouth skier who competed in two Olympics, start Waterville Valley, a ski area favored by both Kennedy and, later, three Sununus -- the first Gov. Sununu and his two sons, one a senator and the other now the state's governor. Think of it as a dynasty on Dynastar skis.

John F. Kerry, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts who won the 2004 New Hampshire primary en route to the party's nomination, headed to Waterville Valley after finding himself 30 percentage points behind Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont in that contest as of Thanksgiving. There he shook hands, skied some runs and, according to David Wade, a longtime adviser who later became chief of staff when Mr. Kerry was Secretary of State, ''showed he was going to see people wherever they were -- the 'fighting-back' part of his campaign as he came back from the brink.""

News reporters covering the primary are on myriad email lists that pump out candidates' schedules, but you don't need to contact a dozen or so campaigns to know where to head after your morning ski. Instead, you can go to the website of the New Hampshire Union-Leader newspaper, whose onetime publisher, William Loeb (when the paper was called the Manchester Union-Leader), once was the scourge of Democratic candidates and is credited for prompting Senator Edmund S. Muskie to lash out at him, and perhaps to cry amid the falling snow, wounding the Maine lawmaker's prospects in 1972. (He won New Hampshire but dropped out by April.) Another good source is the website of the Democratic Party of New Hampshire, where events are listed by candidate. In both cases keep your eyes open to references to the letters ""FITN."" on websites. Political pros know that stands for ''first-in-the-nation,'' a special point of pride in these precincts. But perhaps the most useful list is the one put together by Colin Van Ostern, the 2016 Democratic nominee for governor who was defeated by Chris Sununu. He assembles a list of campaign appearances by region, making it easy to find which events are close to your ski resort. (To sign up for his mailing list contact him at: colinvo@vanostern.com).

""I started doing it and then dozens and then hundreds of people signed up,"" he said. In the last year, Mr. Van Ostern's memos, distributed to a mailing list that has grown to 30,000 people, have become the quintessential Baedeker to New Hampshire presidential politics. Many of the more picturesque hotels and ski resorts are in New Hampshire's North Country, particularly in the White Mountains. Those in the shadow of the aptly named Presidential Range are especially lovely, including the Omni Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, where John Maynard Keynes and 44 finance ministers and economic leaders from the Allied nations met in 1944 and set up the International Monetary Fund. The hotel, often a backdrop for campaign photos, sits in the shadow of both Mount Washington, the highest peak in the Northeast, and the Bretton Woods ski resort, the largest in the state. North Conway, the site of Cranmore Mountain and within striking distance of the Black Mountain, Wildcat, Attitash and King Pine ski areas, has several inns and motels, including the fabled Eastern Slope Inn. One of the classic campaign lodgings is the Bedford Village Inn, a favorite of George W. Bush during the 2000 New Hampshire Primary that he lost to Senator John McCain by 18 percentage points. It is about a half-hour from two smaller ski hills, Pats Peak and Tenney Mountain, and an hour and a half from Waterville Valley. Its great advantage: It is only a quarter-hour drive to downtown Manchester, site of many candidate events in the last days of the primary, when travel to the voter-scarce White Mountains eats up too much valuable campaign time, and only about eight minutes from St. Anselm College, where candidates often flock for a ready audience and smart questions from the students and faculty affiliated with its New Hampshire Institute of Politics. For 81 years the climate observers atop Mount Washington have been evaluating each day's weather on a sliding scale of 5 cents (impenetrable blizzard conditions and unforgiving cold) to 50 cents (brilliant sunshine and seasonably warm temperatures). These ratings still can be heard on WMWV radio (93.5 FM), another good source for campaign information. The day I headed to Black Mountain and then to two events was a 45-center. But truly, any day you can combine skiing and candidate viewing is worth that extra nickel. David M.

Food,Smith & Wollensky Veteran Makes His Mark in the West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/dining/greenwich-steakhouse-opens-victor-chavez.html,"GREENWICH STEAKHOUSE He worked at a bustling, high-profile steak house for 38 years and was the executive chef for 30 of them, but it is doubtful that even the most restaurant-obsessed are familiar with Victor Chavez. That is likely to change, now that Mr. Chavez, 65, who retired a little over a year ago from Smith & Wollensky to return to his native Ecuador, is back in New York and opening his own steakhouse. ""The restaurant life gets in your blood, and you miss the action,"" he said. ""You dream of retirement, but then what do you do?"" He rented a small townhouse in the West Village for the restaurant. The ground floor is the bar, where patrons can order from the dining room menu as well as a selection of smaller portions. Mr. Chavez's approach is very traditional, reflecting his many years at Smith & Wollensky. He buys corn-fed beef that he is dry-aging and broiling. ""Except that my kitchen is smaller, it has the same equipment and layout as Smith & Wollensky, but because this is not a steak factory, I can give everything a more personal touch,"" he said. The dining room, a white room featuring blue velvet chairs and bright photo murals of food, is a radical departure from the usual steakhouse look of polished wood and leather: 62 Greenwich Avenue (11th Street), 212-553-5000, greenwichsteakhouse.com. A&E SUPPLY CO. This few-frills market-restaurant is evolving. It opened late last year, featuring a butcher, a cheese counter and coffee. A liquor bar with snacks came next. Now it's starting dinner service by the chef and a partner, Adam Harvey, highlighting dishes that take advantage of the establishment's grass-fed beef and other meats, and local produce: 548 Fourth Avenue (15th Street), 718-635-3388, aesupplyco.com.

IKINARI STEAK Don't expect to linger, graciously, at this import, which has grown to have 100 locations in Japan since opening less than four years ago. There are 10 seats for parties of more than two, and 40 positions at high-top tables for standing and eating thick slabs of choice Angus beef. The steaks are sold by weight, come in filet, sirloin and rib-eye cuts, and are grilled over an open fire and served on a cast-iron plate. Customers order drinks and side dishes at their assigned station, then go to the butcher counter to order the steak. (Thursday): 90 East 10th Street, 917-388-3546, ikinaristeakusa.com. ROSEMARY'S FARM CSA A limited number of shares in this venture, a restaurant-run source for fresh produce starting in June, are going on sale. The produce comes mostly from a Hudson Valley farm owned by Rosemary's. A basic membership is $200 for 10 weeks; add-ons include fruit, eggs, fresh pasta, bread and a cheese. Each week's supply can be picked up at the restaurant. (Wednesday): Rosemary's, 18 Greenwich Avenue (10th Street), rosemarysnyc.com/farm. THE WOOLY PUBLIC With decor inspired by the landmark Woolworth Building and its lobby murals, this restaurant and bar in the neo-Gothic tower offers interpretations of familiar fare, like a big Green Goddess salad with an array of green vegetables, and a flatiron steak with potato galette. There is a double-patty burger and a more elevated burger made with dry-aged beef. The chef, Jeff Srole, was at Maison Premiere. (Wednesday): 9 Barclay Street (Broadway), 212-571-2930, thewoolypublic.com. UNICO GLOBAL TACOS An array of tacos with international fillings -- marinated shrimp for Lima, Peru, and roasted spiced potatoes, peppers and cucumber salad with raita for India -- are on the menu alongside burritos and enchiladas at this casual spot. It's a collaboration between the chef and restaurateur Suvir Saran, and Roni Mazumdar, his business partner in the West Village restaurant Tapestry. A similar selection of tacos is served at the Tapestry bar. (Tuesday): 31-31 Thomson Avenue (Van Dam Street), Long Island City, Queens, 718-433-3888, unico.nyc. XI'AN FAMOUS FOODS The newest in this chain of Chinese spice havens is down the block from the original one at 67 Bayard Street, closer to Bowery and much larger. Jason Wang, the owner, is turning the original location at 67 Bayard Street into Dumpling Spot for counter-service dumplings, pot-stickers and other small Northern Chinese items: 45 Bayard Street, no phone, xianfoods.com.

BRIAN BISTRONG, who has worked at Bouley and was in charge of Wolfgang Puck's test kitchen, has been named corporate executive chef at Dean & DeLuca, where he will oversee prepared food and the catering menu for the chain of high-end food markets with outlets across the country. MADS REFSLUND, a founder of Noma in Copenhagen, who was the chef at Acme in New York and is now developing his own restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is in Tulum, Mexico. For two months, he will be the guest chef at Gitano Tulum, a mezcal bar and restaurant owned by friends of his. Sean Widger, who was also a chef at Acme, is joining him. Mr. Refslund has some big ideas for his new restaurant, which he hopes to open on North 11th Street opposite the Brooklyn Brewery by year's end. Diners will eat in the kitchen. The thought is to permit more interaction between the kitchen and the customers. The concept behind the menu, he said, will be ""fire and ice"" for raw seafood and dishes cooked in a fire pit. LIFE RESTAURANT Stephen Hanson, the restaurateur who founded BR Guest and who left the company in 2013, is back in the game. He is opening this 65-seat restaurant in the Life Hotel, a boutique hotel in a Beaux-Arts building from 1894 that was once the headquarters for Life magazine. Mr. Hanson is a partner in the restaurant and the hotel, both opening in April. Michael Vignola, who was also at BR Guest, will be the chef and will emphasize seafood and vegetables, mostly as small plates. A former speakeasy on the lower level will become a 1920s-style bar: 19 West 31st Street. MANZO This restaurant in Eataly Flatiron emphasizing meat has closed but will reopen in late March with a more open design incorporating a glassed-in butchering room. In the meantime, on Sundays from noon to 7 p.m., a pop-up version of the restaurant will operate from La Scuola Grande in the market: 200 Fifth Avenue (23rd Street), 212-229-2180, eataly.com. LUCY'S WHEY This boutique cheese counter in Chelsea Market will close at the end of this month, with plans to reopen downtown: 75 Ninth Avenue (15th Street), lucyswhey.com. TAKE ROOT, the intimate, Michelin-starred tasting-menu restaurant, will close on March 17. Though the restaurant is doing well, the chef, Elise Kornack, and her wife, Anna Hieronimus, are relocating to the Hudson Valley, where they may eventually open a restaurant. Meanwhile, Take Root, open three nights a week, is booked until it closes, though Ms. Kornack said they might be able to open up a few more seats: 187 Sackett Street (Henry Street), Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, 347-227-7116, take-root.com.","Victor Chavez opens Greenwich Steakhouse, Ikinari Steak heads to the East Village, and other restaurant news.",09dfb998-bf1d-56ec-94f6-0f01fd5f651a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/22/dining/22OFF/22OFF-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=a7e9248e3a59a195520f7434c23e8a04a40c4dff612e471a9bef748050bbbcc8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Victor Chavez, a veteran of Smith & Wollensky, opened his new steakhouse in a small townhouse in the West Village.",09dfb998-bf1d-56ec-94f6-0f01fd5f651a,N24News/imgs/09dfb998-bf1d-56ec-94f6-0f01fd5f651a.jpg,17
Opinion,The Politics of a Pandemic,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/opinion/coronavirus-pandemic-politics.html,"The coronavirus pandemic is first and foremost a global public health crisis. But here in the United States -- as is likely true in other countries -- the response to it is heavily overlaid with political calculations. It is both obvious and inevitable. The crisis is unfolding in the lead-up to the election. Viewed strictly in a political light, the consequences and rewards of responses to this virus -- good responses as well as bad ones -- suggest a new political dynamic that has few predecessors. There was an election in the midst of the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918, but that was a midterm election year, not a presidential one. I would submit that in general, a national crisis benefits the incumbent, if the nation is perceived to be at war against an outside actor. In such cases, there is a predictable nationalistic rallying. Fear becomes an adhesive; heroism becomes an antidepressant. And the president's bully pulpit is amplified, as networks carry his news conferences and announcements live and the American public tunes in.

People need reassurance, stability and leadership, and changing the person in command in the middle of the process might not appeal to many. As such, Donald Trump has tried in every way to make fighting the pandemic feel like fighting a war. As he tried to frame it: ""We're at war, in a true sense we're at war, and we are fighting an invisible enemy."" But an invisible enemy doesn't work as well as a visible one, so Trump now regularly refers to the virus as the ""Chinese virus."" The problem for Trump is that this actually isn't a war. It's a health crisis. The government may attempt to mobilize in some of the same ways it would if the country were actually at war, but a health crisis carries a different psychological freight than a combat war. A virus is invisible, as Trump originally phrased it, so there isn't a person or a people to vilify. An invisible army of submicroscopic infectious agents with no mind and no capacity for malice isn't an enemy that calls up patriotic defensive cohesion. Calling the virus ""the Chinese virus"" is the closest Trump can get to a target, to racist, cultural scapegoating. Regardless of where the first case of this virus was identified, the United States now has more confirmed cases than any country in the world.

Furthermore, the theater of battle is out of sight, due to patient privacy concerns and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) regulations. This war is being waged in hospitals, and the closest most of us will truly get to understanding the gravity and human cost of the situation is from personal testimonials from health care providers. Here again, the battle differs. In a traditional war, or even a terrorist attack, the front line combatants are public servants, extensions of the government: soldiers, police officers, firefighters. In the case of a health care emergency, many of those on the front lines are private citizens in a for-profit industry. They may rise, and they have in this case, to true honor, nobility and service, but it is hard for a politician to take credit for their effort and sacrifice. That is a thing that leaders like to do: Find a moment when they can declare a victory, even if the war still rages -- George W. Bush on an aircraft carrier standing in front of a ""Mission Accomplished"" banner, or Barack Obama announcing the killing of Osama bin Laden. There is not likely to be such a dramatic moment with this virus unless a vaccine or treatment is quickly developed. Still, Trump forecasts a victory moment, saying earlier this month, ""Americans from every walk of life are coming together and thanks to the spirit of our people, we will win this war and we are, we're winning and we're going to win this war."" Furthermore, it is nearly impossible to grasp the scope of the lethality of the crisis. We see numbers climb, but we rarely see the human representation of those numbers. There is no battlefield to visit. There is no pile of rubble to climb. There is no communal gathering place. Even if there was a place to gather, gatherings are strictly discouraged during this crisis. There is no collective action, and therefore collective conscience, because we are isolated from one another.",Trump wants us to see him as defeating a foreign enemy.,4e0e068c-b188-55dd-a169-c6a3c16ebc0c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/29/opinion/29blowWeb/29blowWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=bb79c185db661bc196c852aeb5f91d7ec52caf2f417d1f3bedadb72ba52b8963&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"President Trump watching the U.S.N.S.

Fashion & Style,Business Before Pleasure. But Both.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/fashion/weddings/business-before-pleasure-but-both.html,"It could have been a human resources nightmare. Instead, it was a match made in office-romance heaven. Or, more accurately, a dozen matches. A small department at the tech company LivingSocial, which provides discounts for activities and travel in cities across the country, proved to be the perfect setting for a group of outgoing 20-somethings to, ahem, live socially. By one former employee's count, there have been 12 serious relationships from a 50-person department. Seven are married, three are engaged and two couples have been in long-term relationships. There are even a few babies on the way.

""We had shared values, ambition and gregarious personalities,"" said Jeremy Hirschhorn, who met his wife, Laura Becker, while working at LivingSocial Adventures, which existed from 2010-13. ""We were outgoing people who really enjoyed making the most of trying new things and being together and having fun."" The department focused on bringing the company offline by curating events for their customers, so it was their business to be social and outgoing. (LivingSocial was eventually sold to its competitor Groupon in 2016.) The relationships started largely in secret, or at the very least went unmentioned in public. Working long hours together fostered strong friendships among the group. ""The culture was such that we were constantly working events, constantly working as a team,"" Ms. Becker said. The group became so close that they spent much of their free time together on the weekends. Ms. Becker and Mr. Hirschhorn were hatching one of those group weekend plans when Mr. Hirschhorn had a different idea.

""Jeremy and I decided to go bike riding from the East Village to Coney Island,"" Ms. Becker recalled. ""We were G-Chatting at work, and I asked him if we should invite the others, and he said no. That was the first time I was like, oh."" Most couples say their goodbyes in the morning, have their work lives and have something to share when they come home at the end of the day. But for these couples, there was no leaving their work at the office. ""We knew each other's days, we sat three seats from each other at one point,"" Ms. Becker said. ""It was a 24-hours-a-day relationship."" Watching Ms. Becker work was one of the things that attracted Mr. Hirschhorn to his future wife. The couple married in December and live in New York. ""She was a boss,"" Mr. Hirschorn said. ""She was exceptional at her job and it seemed very natural to her. She was very independent, had a strong personality, confident. I loved all of those things. It just added to the allure.""

The same was true for Jessie Sunday, who took notice of Michael Seiler while they were managing a large festival in Washington, where LivingSocial was based. Thousands of people were there, but the permits weren't in place. Ms. Sunday watched as Mr. Seiler got to work. ""That's the amazing thing, if you can watch someone in their most vulnerable and stressful moments, when do you really get to see that when you go on a first date?"" Ms. Sunday said. ""And that's when I started realizing this person is amazing, and that I kind of want him to be my person."" None of the couples were under direct management of their partners, but it was still a delicate dance. Mr. Seiler said he was ""very conscious"" about not mixing work with personal life. Sitting next to each other didn't help. So he was hesitant to make his move. In fact, he didn't until the night before Ms. Sunday was scheduled to move back to San Francisco. Two weeks after her cross-country move, Ms. Sunday was back in Washington to visit him. They were married Oct. 15, 2016 at a summer camp in Connecticut, and now live in San Francisco. So was any of this a surprise to the people who hired this group? ""It wasn't intentional but it's not surprising when those people gravitate to each other,"" said Bram Levy, a hiring manager for the team and the officiant at one of the couple's weddings. ""We found a diverse group of people who were unified by their passion for adventure. When you put those people in a room together, it brings everything to life.""","From one 50-person department at the tech company LivingSocial, 12 relationships have grown: engagements, marriages and even a few babies.",63ea2223-6eaf-5b47-a156-30d6e92bac78,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/25/fashion/weddings/25livingsocial4/25livingsocial4-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=44520ce6b36a07e227fa2f85cf6fbc855b8afac9a239a878a053df86cf6db8c5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The outgoing nature of those hired to work for LivingSocial Adventures, which was in Washington, may have been a factor in the seven marriages (and three current engagements) among members of the team.",63ea2223-6eaf-5b47-a156-30d6e92bac78,N24News/imgs/63ea2223-6eaf-5b47-a156-30d6e92bac78.jpg,19
Art & Design,#MeToo Work at Art Basel Offers Cautionary Tale About Political Art,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/16/arts/design/metoo-artwork-art-basel-bowers-ethics.html,"A panel of ""Open Secrets Part I & II, 2018, 2019,"" at the Art Basel fair. A work in the installation that was intended to support women, backfired and was removed.



Andrea Bowers removed part of her installation after complaints -- but her piece raises questions about who can tell intimate stories.

The Los Angeles artist Andrea Bowers made a monumental artwork that she hoped would support the #MeToo movement and presented it, with the help of four galleries, at the prestigious Art Basel fair in Switzerland. Three imposing walls of text and photos made up of 167 red panels retold the stories of men and women who had been accused of sexual misconduct or harassment since the movement began in 2017. But if the intent of her work, called ""Open Secrets Part I & II, 2018, 2019,"" was to raise awareness about insensitivity to women, it seemed to backfire when Helen Donahue, a woman who said she had been abused, complained on Twitter last week that photographs of her were used without her consent, and another woman, Abby Carney, said her name had been used without her consent. In a highly unusual move, Ms. Bowers extracted the panel in question, and issued an apology for having used the photographs. Ethics scholars said the incident at the fair, which closed Sunday , offered a case study in the complexity of creating political art. What rules apply for appropriating images and stories previously posted on personal social media accounts, or allegations made in a journalistic context? As socially conscious art has become increasingly popular, and these works enter galleries and other commercial settings, should moral lines be drawn? ""This is a whole new set of questions,"" said Prof. Griselda Pollock, director of the Center for Cultural Analysis, Theory and History at the University of Leeds in Britain. ""Artists have a right to quote from the world, and they have authorization to present it as their art. But if you use materials that come from one context of use, with its own inherent ethics and politics, into another one, then we find that there are people who are challenging it.""

Ann Demeester, director of the Frans Hals Museum in Haarlem, the Netherlands, who is an authority on ethics in contemporary art, said that Ms. Bowers's work enters ambiguous territory because it makes artwork from personal images and material that was originally presented in a media context, without significant fictionalization or alteration. ""I don't know of any ethical written standards for artists, not even for curators,"" she said, ""but there's a common understanding that you try to be as respectful as possible for any human person that you involved in an artwork. But sometimes when a work is activist, some people fall victim."" Protests erupted in 2017 at the Whitney Biennial when the artist Dana Schutz made a painting based partly on photographs of the mutilated body of Emmett Till, an African American teenager lynched in Mississippi in 1955. His mother had made the photos available to selected media after his death to illustrate the extreme brutality of his murder. Protesters objected to the fact that Ms. Schutz, a white artist, reused it for her own work. The legal aspect at stake is a principle called ""fair use,"" which typically applies when an original is transformed by being incorporated into art. The limits of fair use have been tested in lawsuits against Richard Prince, who has appropriated images posted on social media for his artworks and has sold them for millions of dollars. In this case, there is no lawsuit, but Robert Penchina, a partner at the law firm Ballard Spahr who specializes in copyright, trademark and media law, said that the fair-use principle could apply here. Including Ms. Donahue's photo ""in an artwork where the artist is putting it into context, combining it with 170-odd panels, is telling a particular story, transforming it by building upon it,"" he said. ""I think it is a good candidate for fair use, and potentially defensible on that ground."" The panel of the installation that contained the photograph was removed.

Charles Krause, founding director of the Center for Contemporary Political Art in Washington, said, ""This incident at Basel is probably a useful cautionary tale"" for artists who make political art, and for ""the gallery owners and fair promoters who are their editors."" ""What about the accused?"" he said in an email exchange. ""How many of them have been found guilty in a court of law, as opposed to the court of public opinion and political expediency? Can we trust Andrea's work is accurate with regard to them, or shouldn't we concern ourselves about the actual facts of each individual case?"" The panel of the installation that was removed concerned the freelance writer Michael Hafford and allegations made in 2017 by fellow journalists and former girlfriends in an article in Jezebel, an online magazine. Ms. Bowers, who declined to be interviewed for this piece, seems to have based her panel largely on that article, in which four women described physical or sexual mistreatment by Mr. Hafford. One of them, Ms. Donahue, told Jezebel he had caused her physical pain -- and bruising -- during intercourse that went beyond ""rough sex."" Another, Abby Carney, said he had raped her in 2015. Ms. Carney wrote on Twitter, ""TFW you find out someone turned your rape into ""artwork"" at Art Basel???"" Neither woman has filed formal charges against Mr. Hafford. Mr. Hafford, reached by phone and email, did not respond to questions emailed to him by The New York Times. Neither would he comment on the allegations in Jezebel. In her artwork, Ms. Bowers incorporated photographs of Ms. Donahue's bruised face, chest and shoulders that were originally posted on her Twitter account, and were also used in the Jezebel article; Ms. Carney's full name was written into Ms. Bowers' text.

Ms. Donahue protested on Twitter that use of her image in the work was ""exploiting us for 'art'."" She added, addressing Ms. Bowers, ""Do you know how [expletive] insane it is to find out my beat up face and body are on display as art rn for rich ppl to gawk at thru a stranger's instagram story."" Ms. Bowers ""absolutely realized that that was a mistake,"" said Susanne Vielmetter, the owner and director of Vielmetter Los Angeles, one of the four galleries that collaborated to bring the artwork to the fair. ""We all agreed it should be taken down,"" she said. After they removed the offending panel from the installation, Ms. Bowers contacted Ms. Donahue, and explained the nature of her work and her intentions, Ms. Vielmetter said in an interview. The artist, in a public statement sent to The New York Times by her gallery and published on Twitter on Wednesday, said: ""I, Andrea Bowers, would like to apologize to the survivor whose image was included in my piece,"" adding ""I should have asked for her consent."" Ms. Bowers is known for her drawings, videos and installations that focus on social issues ranging from workers' rights to immigration to victims of harassment, including transgender women. Her artworks, in the collections of the Hammer Museum of Art, in Los Angeles, and the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, have reused text from protest posters and activist slogans. The galleries that brought ""Open Secrets"" to Art Basel, which also include Andrew Kreps, Kaufmann Repetto and Capitain Petzel, also issued an apology, adding ""We stand by Andrea Bowers and her work and support the conversation that has only just begun.""

In an interview, Ms. Carney said that she had never been contacted by the artist for any participation in the project and she had not received an apology from Ms. Bowers. ""Part of the retraumatization is that it's a half story or a poorly told version of the story,"" she said in a telephone interview. ""I'm trying to conclude that chapter, and to be known for my career successes and not for that."" The gallery owner, Ms. Vielmetter, in an interview at the fair, said that ""this piece is showing how widespread this problem of abuse is, and how the cultural dialogue of what is and what isn't acceptable sexual behavior is changing right now."" She added, ""The last thing that we wanted to do was to do more harm to one of the survivors."" Ms. Vielmetter confirmed that the original asking price of the installation was $300,000 but added that the galleries who presented the art have now decided not to offer it for sale ""out of respect for the ongoing conversation between Andrea Bowers and the survivor."" Ms. Carney said that she has mixed feelings about the fact that the single panel was removed, because she supports the idea of a discussion about this topic. ""I believe she probably has good intentions,"" Ms. Carney said of Ms. Bowers, ""but when you're telling someone else's story, if you're not careful, you can make it too general because you haven't really taken the time to understand it.""",Andrea Bowers removed part of her installation after complaints — but her piece raises questions about who can tell intimate stories.,d3a8f51d-e31c-5c48-8b87-f13718aa22f3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/18/arts/18metoo-basel1/13metoo-basel1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=e71c9853fdeb4c12d9ffdb180890465b137b1e830c6726a8408e8c4f7476de3c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A panel of &ldquo;Open Secrets Part I &amp; II, 2018, 2019,&rdquo; at the Art Basel fair.

At Chicago Tattoo & Piercing Co., which has been in business in that city since 1973, the employees have a name for tattoos on the hands, neck and face. ""We call them job stoppers,"" said Joel Jose Molina, a tattoo artist at the shop. ""Your possibilities are cut down. You're going to be working at the Trader Joe's putting groceries away or working that bar job."" Or then again, you might be cutting platinum albums and performing at this year's Lollapalooza Festival, like Post Malone. Or broadcasting your amazing pop star life to your 101 million Instagram followers, like Justin Bieber. Both musicians have tattoos on their faces, a once taboo area to ink. Post Malone has ""Stay Away"" in curly script on his forehead and the words ""Always"" and ""Tired"" below each eye, while Mr. Bieber has a tiny, under-eye cross. Other artists with inked faces include 21 Savage (a knife on his forehead), Lil Xan (the words ""xanarchy"" and ""candy,"" the number ""1996""), and Tekashi 6ix9ine, who was reportedly kidnapped and beaten last month (the number ""69,"" a red flower, the face of Jigsaw from the ""Saw"" movies). But marking one's face isn't limited to rappers, or men, or celebrities. Kat Von D, the tattoo artist and model, has a wash of blue stars trailing down her forehead and cheek. Instagram, predictably, is filled with photos (#facetattoo) of people, most of them young, showing off their new face ink.

For decades, tattoos in highly visible areas, especially the face, were considered the extreme in body art, at least in Western culture. It wasn't only members of polite society who were put off. Even among tattoo aficionados, the face was sacrosanct, a canvas of last resort when the rest of the body was covered. Over his 12-year career, said Mr. Molina, 34, he has done only three face tattoos. ""Two were on tattooers, and one was on this gangster from Florida who sold a bunch of weed and wanted his eyelid tattooed,"" he said. JonBoy, a New York-based tattoo artist who gave Mr. Bieber his cross and who has tattooed many other celebrities, half-joked that in the past, if he spotted someone with a face tattoo, ""I'd walk on the other side of the street."" Indeed, one saw a face tat and thought: Aryan Brotherhood or gang member or sideshow performer. Famous face tattoo wearers of the recent past, like Mike Tyson, Charles Manson and the drug-addled skateboarder Jay Adams, conformed to the stereotype of the rough character. All of which makes their current popularity more striking -- or perhaps not, at a time when tattoos have become ubiquitous.

Anna Felicity Friedman, a scholar who runs the website Tattoo Historian, said that starting in the 1990s, it became common to see athletes and celebrities with tattoos. Soon, reality TV shows (with titles like ""Best Ink"" and ""Tattoo Nightmares"") and magazines began covering tattoo culture, and Americans embraced body art like never before. Tattoos, as a result, began losing their renegade status. Hence the creep upward, past the neckline. ""If you want to be transgressive -- and a lot of rappers want to create a transgressive character -- the last frontier is the face,"" Ms. Friedman said. ""Some of it is to give them a rebel/criminal allure. And some of it is a more artistic or free-spirit reference.""

Post Malone has offered a simpler explanation to reporters for his face tattoos: anything to upset my mom. But with the notable exception of Lil Wayne and Wiz Khalifa, two heavily inked established artists, many of the hip-hop stars with face tattoos are so-called SoundCloud rappers -- young, unknown artists who post their music on SoundCloud for free. Getting Anne Frank's portrait etched on the side of your face, as the rapper and producer Arnoldisdead did, is one obvious way to attract attention.

""A lot of kids are doing it to make themselves bigger on social media,"" said Travis Hardy, 30, a creative director in Los Angeles who works with musicians. ""It's kind of corny."" Last month, he a got a lightning bolt tattooed under his left eye. ""I don't need that,"" Mr. Hardy said, referring to others' quest for attention. ""This isn't for followers or comments."" (Though there is, in fact, a thoughtfully composed shot on Mr. Hardy's Instagram.) ""There's no turning back. There's no normal job or whatever,"" Mr. Hardy said. ""I'm going to continue to creative direct or write treatments for music videos or stage design. I'm not going to turn around. This served as a stamp: I believe in myself."" Mr. Hardy's tattoo is so small as to be easily mistaken for a birthmark or go unnoticed in public. It is what JonBoy, who did the face tattoo, considers ""classy."" Harder to miss is the tattoo that Kerwin Frost, a member of the Spaghetti Boys creative collective, has on his face: a realistic pencil that runs the entire length of his right cheek . Reactions to the pencil have been all over the map, Mr. Frost said. ""Some people scream at me,"" he said. ""Some people also get super-angry because life is working out for me right now, so it's, what can I call out? A lot of people really love it and ask me if I draw.""

He has no regrets. ""It's honestly almost made my life better having it, not going to lie,"" Mr. Frost said. And if at some point he wants it gone (as Gucci Mane appears to have done, erasing the ice cream cone tattoo off his face), laser removal technology has become better and more affordable. Still, don't expect face tattoos to become commonplace anytime soon. Mr. Molina, the Chicago tattoo artist, says that those getting face tattoos are generally young and work in untraditional jobs. For what it's worth, he has no plans to get one himself. ""I know if I drop my kid off at school and I have face tattoos, the teacher is going to judge me,"" he said. Echoing many in the tattoo community, Mr. Molina also believes that a face tattoo should never be someone's first time getting inked. When an 18-year-old woman recently asked him for a tattoo on her ear, he saw she had no other visible tattoos and talked her out of it. ""You have to earn it,"" he said. ""It's a rite of passage.""",Post Malone and Justin Bieber are the most visible examples of how ink has crossed a new line.,7b5b2eb9-fc6a-5729-bc58-46f83890043b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/05/fashion/05FACETATTOO-promo/05FACETATTOO-promo-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=f1e6f3d91cda79eff6d182be6437887eeb99d3eadd8a49e449760482f4373f22&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"For many, face tattoos are no longer taboo.

Media,"Time Inc. Shakes Up Management, Replacing Chief Executive",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/business/media/time-inc-joe-ripp-management-shakeup.html,"Joseph A. Ripp at the New York Stock Exchange in 2014 as Time Inc. spun off from Time Warner.

For the second time in two months, Time Inc., the publisher of Time, People and Sports Illustrated, has shuffled its top leadership as it tries to reinvent itself as a digital organization and turn its well-known magazine titles into successful online properties. The company announced on Tuesday that it had named a new chief executive to succeed its chief of three years, Joseph A. Ripp, effective immediately. The new chief, Rich Battista is Time Inc.'s executive vice president and president for brands. Mr. Ripp will become the executive chairman and continue to lead the board. In an interview, Mr. Ripp, 64, who guided Time Inc. through its spinoff from Time Warner two years ago, said that he and the board had always had conversations about a succession plan, but the decision to appoint a new chief executive was ""a little bit accelerated"" because of a recent health incident.

""While I wasn't hit by a bus, a couple of weeks ago I really did have a health issue,"" he said, that made him reassess how much time he could put into the company. He declined to provide more details on the incident, but said he was ""quite healthy right now."" The change in leadership occurred a month after Jana Partners, an activist investment firm, revealed in a regulatory filing that it had taken a stake in the company. Mr. Battista, 52, who joined Time Inc. last year, has worked in the media industry for 25 years and has held executive and management roles at companies including Mandalay Sports Media and Fox Television.  Mr. Battista takes the reins of Time Inc. at a time of great transition. In July, the company named Alan Murray, the editor of Fortune, its chief content officer, overseeing all of its editors in the United States. It also reorganized its advertising sales and brand development teams.

Magazine publishers across the spectrum have struggled to adapt to an increasingly digital world, but Time Inc.'s strategy has at times appeared to lack focus. The company has looked to bolster its capabilities in mobile, events, native advertising -- ads that look like editorial content -- and video, buying companies like HelloGiggles, a lifestyle site aimed at women, and Viant, the parent of Myspace. It has introduced mobile platforms like Instant, which features videos of celebrities. And it has started an ad-supported video streaming service from People and Entertainment Weekly.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions. Several revenue initiatives, including Instant and the streaming service, were under Mr. Battista's purview. ""The overall mandate is to turn this company into a growth story and bring us to a whole new level,"" Mr. Battista said in an interview, ""and I think there are tremendous opportunities to do that."" ""In my short tenure here, I think I've had a track record of building new businesses and new opportunities,"" he added. Since the spinoff, Time Inc.'s stock has tumbled, and the company has struggled to turn itself around in the face of falling print advertising and circulation revenue. The company has had disappointing financial results, albeit with some gains in digital advertising revenue. In the second quarter, when Time Inc.'s revenue declined 1 percent, its digital ad revenue increased 65 percent. Still, when Time Inc. reported its second-quarter earnings last month, it lowered its guidance for the year and now expects its revenue to be flat to 1.5 percent higher compared with last year. It had previously forecast its revenue to be 1 to 5 percent higher. Last year, the company's revenue fell 5 percent. Mr. Battista said Time Inc. was focusing more on native advertising and video as it looks to increase revenue. The company is also investing heavily in technology, particularly for digital advertising. He did not say when the company would become ""a growth story.""","Rich Battista was named president and chief executive, and the current chief executive, Joseph A.

Real Estate,"On Staten Island, Wilderness With Creature Comforts",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/realestate/on-staten-island-wilderness-with-creature-comforts.html,"It's not surprising that the 19th-century transcendentalists were attracted to Emerson Hill on Staten Island: The neighborhood still has a measure of the natural beauty of the wilderness that first attracted those poets and philosophers. Abounding in beeches and oaks of great height and age, the area is named for William Emerson, a former resident and a brother of the poet Ralph Waldo Emerson, who was a frequent visitor along with the likes of Nathaniel Hawthorne and Henry David Thoreau. Up a hill that has only two unassuming entrances, this neighborhood of just over 100 houses hidden in thickets has retained anonymity even by the standards of an island borough -- a kind of side benefit of its geography.

""I lived on Staten Island for 10 years, 12 years, and I didn't know it existed,"" Mr. Marchese said. ""I used to drive by it all the time, and one day there were balloons out there at the bottom of the hill, where it says 'No Through Traffic,' and it looks like a giant driveway. A sign said 'Open House,' and I said: 'What the heck is this? You can go up this hill?' "" Mr. Marchese did, and made an offer on the house as soon as he saw its tree-trimmed property and the sprawling views from its back deck.

""To the left was the city, to the right was New Jersey, and right in dead center was the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge,"" he said, ""and it was so beautiful. The agent came out and said, 'You want to see the rest of the house?' And I said, 'No, I just want to make an offer.' "" The current estimate for that house, for which Mr. Marchese paid about $900,000 a decade ago, may be almost $1.2 million, he said; it has appreciated far less than he had originally hoped. But the value has been in enjoying the property, where sightings of deer, raccoons, opossums and birds are frequent, he said.

Art & Design,"Newport Festival — for Art, Not Music — Draws George Condo and More",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/arts/design/newport-festival-for-art-draws-george-condo-and-more.html,"Newport, R.I., has long been famous for its music festivals. But public art there has been less abundant. Dodie Kazanjian, a native of that city who covers the art world for Vogue and is the director of Gallery Met at the Metropolitan Opera, is about to change that, with a low-key opening, as she put it, of the first Art & Newport festival.

""Newport has a long history as a place for artists,"" Ms. Kazanjian said. ""Luminists like William Trost Richards and Fitz Henry Lane came and painted here. And over 40 years ago, we had Monumenta, the international exhibition of public sculpture.""

Ms. Kazanjian has invited four artists to create works in three Newport institutions. Seven paintings by George Condo, in a show the artist has called ""The Newport Sexx Festival,"" are at the Newport Art Museum (plus one at the Redwood Library & Athenaeum); a poster declaring as much reworks a 1959 Newport Jazz Festival poster and will be for sale in a limited edition to benefit the museum (through July 21).

The video artist Tony Oursler has filled a tent on the museum grounds with floating heads and a smoke machine -- a display that Ms. Kazanjian said would discombobulate the senses (through July 9). Shara Hughes, who was part of the recent Whitney Biennial, has taken over an octagonal folly at the Redwood, filling it with an imaginary landscape, among other elements (through Sept. 21). And at Trinity Church, the altar is to be animated by a wind-powered cloth sculpture by Paul Chan (through July 7).","Dodie Kazanjian, a Newport, R.I., native who covers the art world for Vogue, has invited four artists to create works in three historic institutions.",4d490c2c-a227-59f2-86d2-714c1af2a47d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/28/arts/28newport-item/28newport-item-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=87439d32724e4b7fc94464f22f994501ce560976db28264b7074280e8671266d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The first Art & Newport festival will include seven George Condo paintings in a show that he is calling ""The Newport Sexx Festival.""",4d490c2c-a227-59f2-86d2-714c1af2a47d,N24News/imgs/4d490c2c-a227-59f2-86d2-714c1af2a47d.jpg,14
Movies,"Where to Stream 'Green Book,' 'Bohemian Rhapsody' and Other Big Oscar Winners",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/movies/oscars-stream-movies.html,"On an Oscar night when all eight best picture nominees took home one or more awards, ""Green Book"" emerged as the big winner, taking the top prize along with wins for its screenplay and for Mahershala Ali's supporting performance as Dr. Don Shirley, an African-American concert pianist touring the South during segregation. A few of the winning features have yet to debut on streaming services -- ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" is coming Tuesday, and ""If Beale Street Could Talk"" and ""Vice"" follow in successive weeks.

Despite persistent criticism over its ""white savior"" narrative and storytelling liberties, this warm comedy-drama has appealed to many with its optimistic vision of racial harmony against a hostile backdrop. Ali and Viggo Mortensen have a likable odd couple chemistry as a celebrated African-American pianist and an Italian-American bouncer who escorts him on a concert tour through the segregated Deep South in 1962. One of the writers, Peter Farrelly, has a background in broad comedies like ""Kingpin"" and ""There's Something about Mary,"" which informs the unlikely camaraderie between the two men and buoys the film in its darker stretches. How to watch: Stream it on Netflix.

At once a personal reflection on his childhood and an expansive look at the cultural turbulence of early 1970s Mexico City, Alfonso Cuaron's ""Roma"" is an empathetic attempt to look at the past from a fresh perspective. As an upper-middle-class family adjusts to life without a patriarch, a mother (Marina de Tavira) and her children become increasingly reliant on their live-in housekeeper, Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), for comfort and order, not realizing that Cleo's life is in heartbreaking disarray. ""Roma"" feels like Cuaron's long-overdue acknowledgment of his own caretaker's private hardships, shot through with overwhelming passion and stylistic brio.

With his delectable black comedy, the Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos tiptoes into the mainstream after a series of odd, misanthropic art films like ""Dogtooth,"" ""The Lobster"" and ""The Killing of a Sacred Deer,"" but he hasn't entirely buffed out their serrated edges. In the rivalry between two women (Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz), who are fighting for influence over an ailing Queen Anne (Olivia Colman), Lanthimos and his screenwriters, Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, reveal the corrosive influence of power, but they have a lot of fun doing it. As the queen, Colman is especially good at playing a woman who may be deteriorating but knows how to get what she wants. How to watch: Rent it on iTunes, Amazon, Vudu, Google Play and YouTube. The director Spike Lee has a reputation for audacity and provocation that carries over to this fact-based film about a black cop in Colorado Springs named Ron Stallworth (John David Washington), who infiltrated a Ku Klux Klan chapter in the early 1970s. But what stands out about ""BlacKkKlansman"" is how expertly Lee modulates tone, playing up the fish-out-of-water absurdity of Stallworth's operation while suggesting a history of white supremacy in America that continues to manifest itself today. Adam Driver embodies that tonal duality as Stallworth's partner, alternately a source of gravitas and comic relief. (Read a transcript of Lee's passionate acceptance speech here.)

For years, the popularity of the superhero genre has exposed the disconnect between the films the Academy Awards acknowledges and the films that mainstream audiences actually watch. ""Black Panther"" is a groundbreaking achievement in that respect, a spectacle that conforms to the familiar template of the Marvel Cinematic Universe while smuggling across a substantive and surprisingly political study of black identity. As Erik Killmonger, the chief threat to the techno-utopian African nation of Wakanda, Michael B. Jordan plays a villain whose motives are so complex that the word ""villain"" seems like too narrow a descriptor.

All four iterations of ""A Star is Born"" are fascinating era-specific snapshots of the entertainment industry, and with his directorial debut, Bradley Cooper contends with an ascendant moment for female pop artists and the star-making machinery that sustains them. As a drag-bar singer discovered by a hard-drinking stadium rocker (Cooper), Lady Gaga's Ally begins the film as a raw, unproven, unvarnished talent and ends it looking closer to the glammed-up superstar Gaga has become in the real world. Her performance of the Oscar-winning song ""Shallow"" is the bridge that gets her there, an electrifying howl that sets the trajectories of her and her benefactor in opposite directions.

Alex Honnold is not only one of the best climbers in the world, he is also one of tiny fraction of climbers who specialize in ""free soloing,"" which involves ascending a rock face without ropes or any other form of safety gear. ""Free Solo"" chronicles Honnold's extraordinary effort to scale El Capitan, a 3,000-foot granite rock in Yosemite National Park. As Honnold prepares for the big day, the film also takes a keen interest in his romantic life, which both he and his partner know can be extinguished by one small, tragic misstep.

Damien Chazelle's follow-up to ""La La Land,"" his swooning valentine to the movie musical, more closely resembles the film that preceded it, ""Whiplash,"" in its visceral attention to the rigors and ardors of achieving greatness. Unlike other films about the space program, ""First Man"" doesn't romanticize mankind's ascent to the heavens, and it doesn't give the famously reticent Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) some hidden depth that had never been accessed before. It's more concerned with giving viewers a powerful, you-are-there impression of men rattling through the sky in crude vessels, not knowing if they will ever make it back to Earth.","Nearly all of the night's winner's are available online to stream, rent or buy.

Food,Pig and Khao Chef Unveils Her Latest in Chelsea,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/14/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html,"Leah Cohen's latest has a broader scope than her Lower East Side spot, Pig and Khao. ""The food at Pig and Khao is from Southeast Asia,"" she said. Piggyback NYC's focus is ""all over Asia except India, and is inspired by our travels."" This new spot in Chelsea features Chinese dishes like a Hainanese duck with a rice cake and two sauces, as well as Filipino lumpia done Shanghai-style, and Korean wings with gochujang sauce. Still, Ms. Cohen's menu makes several stops in Southeast Asia: Vietnam for her take on the fish and herb dish cha ca la vong, Thailand for fried rice and Indonesia for lamb rendang. The restaurant has a narrow, brick-walled space with a bar and some tables, and a kitchen pass-through that opens into a bright, airy and informal dining room whose walls Ms. Cohen's husband and partner, Ben Byruch, papered with Asian newspapers and advertisements. Butterfly pea flower, Thai basil and gochujang season some cocktails.

Natalie Hernandez, a Texan with a background in fashion, offers her take on home-style Mexican cooking at this Brooklyn spot. Though vegetables are featured in much of the food, her signature dish is a quesadilla with crisp chicharrones, salsa verde and white onions. The small restaurant is decorated to evoke the colorful colonial city San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, where most of her family lives.

It's not the first time that Fany Gerson, the maker of Mexican sweets, has teamed up with Danny Mena, the chef who was an owner of Hecho en Dumbo and now runs La Loncheria in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Last year, she created frozen paletas that were served at La Loncheria. Now they're simmering pozole in several guises and serving them at a pop-up they created at Ms. Gerson's La Newyorkina, to be open at least until March 21.

Dance,"Jean Erdman, a Dancer Moved by Myth, Is Dead at 104",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/arts/dance/jean-erdman-dead.html,"The dancer and choreographer Jean Erdman performing her piece ""Ophelia"" in 1972. She was among the first choreographers to exploit the inherent theatricality of dance, melding it with drama, poetry, music and visual art.





Jean Erdman, a modern dancer, choreographer and theater director whose work was suffused with the dreamlike aura of myth and legend, died on Monday in Kailua, Hawaii. She was 104. Her death, in a nursing facility, was announced by Nola Hague, a friend. A former principal dancer for Martha Graham, Ms. Erdman first came to wide notice as a choreographer in the 1940s, and she remained in the vanguard of the field for decades. She later created performance pieces for the Theater of the Open Eye, an avant-garde New York stage she founded in 1972 with her husband, Joseph Campbell, the scholar of literature and myth. Ms. Erdman was among the first choreographers to exploit the inherent theatricality of dance, melding it with drama, poetry, music and visual art to form a seamless whole, or ""total theater,"" as it was known then. Today it might be described as performance art. Her dances, among them ""The Transformations of Medusa"" and ""Ophelia,"" often focused on the inner lives of women -- unorthodox fare at midcentury.

Ms. Erdman was known in particular for her collaborations with some of the world's leading contemporary composers, including John Cage, Lou Harrison, Ezra Laderman and Alan Hovhaness. While the allusive, impressionistic quality of her choreography bewildered some critics, many praised her work for its lyric mystery; its soft, fluid lines; and its ability, at its best, to conjure worlds both real and imagined. Her most renowned piece was the dance drama ""The Coach With the Six Insides."" A comic adaptation of James Joyce's stream-of-consciousness masterwork ""Finnegans Wake"" (the title comes from Joyce's text), it married dance with spoken dialogue, mime and Joycean wordplay. Its original score, by the Japanese composer Teiji Ito, featured Eastern and Western instruments. In Ms. Erdman's adaptation (inspired partly by ""A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake,"" the 1944 guide written by Professor Campbell and Henry Morton Robinson), the story shifted its focus to Finnegan's wife, Anna Livia Plurabelle. Anna is the incarnation of the River Liffey, which flows through Dublin. Ms. Erdman danced the role herself, along with other parts, including those of a hen and the rain. In still other roles she cast, as she put it, ""actors who can move like dancers.""

The show opened in 1962 at the Off Broadway theater Village South, where it ran for 114 performances, a noteworthy achievement for a dance program. Writing about ""The Coach With the Six Insides"" in The New York Times that December, Allen Hughes said: ""The vocal and emotional inflections of the four actors who work with Miss Erdman are so rich and musical, one really need not try to make literal sense of what they say. Miss Erdman has choreographed virtually every movement they make, and this means that there is a visual rhythm that organizes what they do.""

""The Coach With the Six Insides"" won a Vernon Rice Award (a forerunner of the Drama Desk Award) and a special citation from the Obie Awards, the Off Broadway honor given by The Village Voice. The production toured the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan and was later revived in New York. Ms. Erdman also choreographed several Broadway productions. Among them were the poet W.S. Merwin's translation of Federico Garcia Lorca's tragedy ""Yerma,"" staged in 1966, and the New York Shakespeare Festival's 1971 rock adaptation of ""Two Gentlemen of Verona."" For ""Two Gentlemen,"" which had music by Galt MacDermot, the composer of ""Hair,"" and lyrics by the playwright John Guare, Ms. Erdman received a Drama Desk Award and was nominated for a Tony.

Jean Erdman was born on Feb. 20, 1916, in Honolulu. Her father, John Piney Erdman, the scion of missionary family, presided over a nondenominational congregation there; her mother, Marion (Dillingham) Erdman, was the daughter of one of Hawaii's most prominent industrialist families. Growing up where she did, Ms. Erdman later said, she found dancing ""as natural as swimming."" As she told The Times in 1982: ""I found myself involved with the dance as a child in Hawaii. We'd have picnics on the sand and get up and do hulas. I didn't even know what I was talking about at the time, but I wanted to create my own theater."" That early training had an unfortunate consequence when the young Ms. Erdman was a student at Miss Hall's School, an exclusive preparatory academy in Pittsfield, Mass. There, she taught her classmates her native dance and was disciplined soundly for it. Even on the heels of the Roaring Twenties, the hula was considered no fit fare for young ladies.

Ms. Erdman married Professor Campbell in 1938, settling in Greenwich Village, and joined the Martha Graham Dance Company that same year. Her best-known roles with the troupe included the One Who Speaks in ""Letter to the World,"" based on the poems of Emily Dickinson, and the Speaking Fate in ""Punch and the Judy,"" Ms. Graham's comic ballet about marital dissonance. By the mid-1940s, Ms. Erdman felt she needed to break free of Ms. Graham's autocracy. ""I finally had to inform Martha of my convictions to go out on my own,"" she told The Honolulu Advertiser in 2003. ""The confrontation was just awful for me. She said, 'I didn't think that you would ever let me down.'"" Ms. Graham eventually forgave her, and Ms. Erdman later appeared with the troupe as a guest dancer. Ms. Erdman founded her own company, the Jean Erdman Dance Group, later renamed the Jean Erdman Theater of Dance. In the mid-1950s, she toured East Asia as a soloist. She was believed to be the first American dancer to appear there since World War II. Her other works as a choreographer include ""Creature on a Journey,"" inspired by Balinese dance; ""Fearful Symmetry,"" in which a dancer is encased in a sculpture by the American artist Carlus Dyer; ""Hamadryad,"" to the music of Debussy; and ""Twenty Poems,"" a setting of E.E. Cummings. Her dance ""The Transformations of Medusa"" was the subject of ""Medusa,"" an unfinished 1949 film by the experimental documentarian Maya Deren. Over the years Ms. Erdman taught at Columbia University Teachers College, Bard College and the University of Colorado. She founded the dance theater program at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in 1966 and remained on the faculty through the early 1970s.","Ms. Erdman, who first came to wide notice as a choreographer in the 1940s, often focused in her work on the inner lives of women.",2e7d4f0b-5782-52e8-93b7-0eacc61b6812,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/08/obituaries/06erdman1/06erdman1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=b35e90a801fc4e90016a2cae8f05e13131caf57d34e5c9e16ff0658dde7eddcc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The dancer and choreographer Jean Erdman performing her piece &ldquo;Ophelia&rdquo; in 1972.

Books,"Michel Déon, Novelist Who Tapped the French Experience, Dies at 97",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/01/arts/michel-deon-novelist-who-tapped-the-french-experience-dies-at-97.html,"Michel Deon in 2003 in the library of the Institut de France in Paris.

Michel Deon, a French writer and a member of the Academie Francaise whose dozens of novels offered a witty, panoramic view of French society and history, died on Dec. 28 in Galway, Ireland. He was 97. His death was announced by the academy, Agence France-Presse said. Mr. Deon was known in the English-speaking world primarily for two novels. His ""Where Are You Dying Tonight?"" (""Un Dejeuner de Soleil""), the fictional biography of a mysterious man of letters, appeared in France in 1981 and became his first work translated into English, in 1989. The other novel, ""The Foundling Boy,"" published in 1975 as ""Le Jeune Homme Vert,"" told the story, with robust humor and a nod to Henry Fielding's ""Tom Jones,"" of a Frenchman who comes of age amid the turbulent politics of the 1930s. An English translation appeared in 2013. To French readers, Mr. Deon was a complicated and contrarian figure: a political reactionary whose work evolved from experimentalism to more traditional forms, and an enthusiastic champion of young renegade writers.

After being elected to the academy in 1978, he used his influence to bring attention to Jean Rolin, Emmanuel Carrere and the American-French writer Jonathan Littell, whose 2006 Holocaust novel, ""The Kindly Ones,"" received the academy's top prize. Mr. Deon prided himself, he once said, on preserving ""a certain anarchism of the right and a pessimism that strives for lucidity."" He was born Edouard Michel on Aug. 4, 1919, in Paris, an only child. He took his pen name from his maternal grandmother, Blanche Deon de Beaumont. His father, Paul, a civil servant, took his son and his wife, the former Alice de Fossey, to Monaco in 1927 after being appointed chief of security for that principality. He died in 1933 and Edouard returned with his mother to Paris, where he attended the Lycee Janson-de-Sailly and studied law at the University of Paris. He wrote about his childhood in a memoir, ""Your Father's Room"" (2004). He was drafted into the army in 1939 and, after being discharged three years later, remained in the southern zone, outside Nazi-occupied France, working as an editor of Action Francaise, the journal of the ultranationalist monarchist movement of the same name. In 1944 he returned to Paris and completed his first novel, ""Farewell to Sheila."" Alienated by the leftist orientation of French intellectual life after the war, dominated by Jean-Paul Sartre and his journal Les Temps Modernes, Mr. Deon became a newspaper correspondent in Italy and Switzerland.

He continued to travel for much of the rest of his life, spending long periods in Portugal; in Greece, where he bought a house on the island of Spetsai; and in Ireland, where he settled in the western village of Tynagh in the late 1960s. With grants from the Institute of International Education and the Rockefeller Foundation, he traveled across the United States by Greyhound bus in 1950, explored French-speaking Canada and studied Cajun French. In 1952 the literary critic Bernard Frank, writing in Les Temps Modernes, placed Mr. Deon in a new school of disruptive, slashingly polemical right-wing writers he called the Hussars, after Roger Nimier's 1950 novel, ""The Blue Hussar."" The other core members of the group, whose existence Mr. Deon always denied, were Jacques Laurent and Antoine Blondin. ""They form a fascinating quartet of original, cosmopolitan, witty minds, far superior to their British contemporaries, the Angry Young Men,"" the poet and novelist James Kirkup wrote in his obituary of Mr. Laurent for the Independent of London in 2001. With ""Night People"" (1958), Mr. Deon moved toward the front rank of postwar novelists, summoning a nightmarish vision of Paris through the nocturnal wanderings of his insomniac main character. In ""Wild Ponies"" (1970), one of his best-known novels in France, he presented an ambitious social canvas, describing the adventures of five friends who, after studying together at an English university, disperse across Europe during World War II and the Cold War. ""A Purple Taxi"" (""Un Taxi Mauve"") (1973), about a French expatriate in Ireland and the colorful characters he encounters, was made into a 1977 film with Philippe Noiret, Peter Ustinov, Fred Astaire and Charlotte Rampling. The book was awarded the Grand Prix du Roman by the academy. In 1963 Mr. Deon married Chantal Renaudeau d'Arc, who survives him, as do their children, Alice and Alexandre.","Mr. Déon was complicated and contrarian, his wit and depth coming through in works like ""A Purple Taxi"" and ""The Foundling Boy.""",019d7f57-ff07-5913-9467-4f68f488f372,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/02/arts/deonobit/deonobit-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=6dad42bb206a46273936820938a9c491ceaae36dd48a951cf9a4197a086aaa57&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Michel Déon in 2003 in the library of the Institut de France in Paris.,019d7f57-ff07-5913-9467-4f68f488f372,N24News/imgs/019d7f57-ff07-5913-9467-4f68f488f372.jpg,13
Media,"With Vinyl, the Musician Tycho Establishes a Physical Presence",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/03/business/media/with-vinyl-the-musician-tycho-establishes-a-physical-presence.html,"The staggered timing lets Mr. Hansen and Ghostly release the music quickly -- Mr. Hansen said he put the finishing touches on the recording just two weeks ago -- while also giving a tangible dimension to what is otherwise digital ephemera. Mr. Hansen, a former graphic designer, handles the artwork of his records himself, and their look and feel are a major part of their attraction to fans; of the 70,000 copies of Tycho's last album, ""Awake,"" that were sold, 26 percent were on vinyl.

""We've always been really concerned with the physical experience,"" Mr. Hansen said. ""A lot of people want the vinyl so that they feel that this music is real, it's not just a digital file.""

The plan also reflects how deeply many basic aspects of music marketing are now in flux, as the industry is being reshaped by streaming media. According to the Recording Industry Association of America, streaming now accounts for 47 percent of retail sales in the United States, and physical formats only 20 percent.

Vinyl records, which are often priced at a premium, have grown so quickly that they now generate almost half the sales revenue of CDs. Yet a decades-old manufacturing infrastructure means that labels must often wait months for a pressing plant to turn around a new record.

Independent labels like Ghostly must also manage the demands of digital services, which want exclusive content, and independent record stores, still a vital channel for sales and promotion.","Physical records, like the ones offered by Scott Hansen, who performs electronic rock as Tycho, claim a big chunk of record sales in a digital age.",6450b885-da4f-533a-a148-66be1a6204b6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/30/business/03GHOSTLY1/03GHOSTLY1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=0762aa4ec9f9ec111d667d6cc5673ce699f528d9119471e17feeec36f5052022&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Scott Hansen, who performs spacey electronic rock under the name Tycho, at a soundcheck in Philadelphia.",6450b885-da4f-533a-a148-66be1a6204b6,N24News/imgs/6450b885-da4f-533a-a148-66be1a6204b6.jpg,16

Health,"Skinny and 119 Pounds, but With the Health Hallmarks of Obesity",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/26/health/skinny-fat.html,"Credit...Andrew White for The New York Times



Claire Walker Johnson of Queens was a medical mystery. No matter how much she ate, she never gained weight. And yet Ms. Johnson, with a long narrow face, had the conditions many obese people develop -- Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and, most strikingly, a liver buried in fat. She and a very small group of very thin people like her have given scientists surprising clues to one of the most important questions about obesity: Why do fat people often develop serious and sometimes life-threatening medical conditions? The answer has little to do with the fat itself. It's about each person's ability to store it. With that understanding, scientists are now working on drug treatments to protect people from excess unstored fat and spare them from dire medical conditions.

The need is clear. One in three Americans and one in four adults worldwide have at least three conditions associated with obesity such as diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure -- a combination of disorders that doubles their risk of heart attacks and strokes. In addition, 2 percent to 3 percent of adults in America, or at least five million people, have a grave accumulation of fat in their livers caused by obesity that can lead to liver failure. The detective work that led to this new scientific understanding of fat began with a small group of scientists curious about a disorder that can be caused by a gene mutation so rare it is estimated to affect just one in 10 million people, including, it turned out, Ms. Johnson. For much of her life, Ms. Johnson, 55, had no idea anything was amiss. Yes, she was very thin and always ravenous, but in Jamaica, where she was born, many children were skinny, she says, and no one thought much of it. She seemed healthy, and she developed normally through adolescence. After coming to the United States as a college student, she saw a doctor for some bumps on her arms and was stunned to learn that they were cholesterol crystallizing from her blood. Her cholesterol level was sky high. Further exams revealed that she had other problems fat people can develop -- a huge fatty liver, ovarian cysts, extraordinarily high levels of triglycerides.

Ms. Johnson's doctor was baffled. The usual instructions to patients to lose weight made no sense in this case. ""He said, 'I don't think I can help you,'"" she recalled. She ended up in the office of an endocrinologist, Dr. Maria New, who also was stumped but determined to find answers. She measured Ms. Johnson: 5 feet 7 inches. She weighed her: 119 pounds. Dr. New spent years asking specialists at every medical conference she attended about Ms. Johnson. One day in 1996, she was giving a lecture at the National Institutes of Health and posed her usual query: Did anyone know what might be wrong with her skinny patient? Dr. Simeon Taylor, who was the chief of the diabetes branch at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, popped up from his chair. He had seen several patients like Ms. Johnson. They have lipodystrophy, he said, a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by an abnormal lack of fatty tissue.

Leptin is released by fat cells and travels through the blood to the brain. The more fat on a person's body, the more leptin is released. When fat levels are low, leptin levels in the brain are low, and the brain responds by increasing the person's appetite, prompting the person to eat and gain weight. For someone like Ms. Johnson, who has almost no fat cells to signal the brain, the brain gets almost no leptin. To the brain, it seems as if she is starving. As a result, she receives continuous signals to eat. With leptin treatment, Ms. Johnson's brain was tricked into responding as though she had abundant fat. Her insatiable hunger vanished. Fat disappeared from her liver, her blood glucose became normal, and so did her cholesterol and triglyceride levels. But why did she and other lipodystrophy patients have these conditions in the first place, and why did they vanish? What was going on? A couple of studies involving mice produced some clues. Dr. Marc Reitman, the chief of the diabetes, endocrinology and obesity branch at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and his colleague, Dr. Charles Vinson, of the National Cancer Institute, genetically engineered mice to have lipodystrophy. The mice, like Ms. Johnson, had almost no fat tissue. And like her, they developed all of the conditions associated with obesity. What would happen, the researchers asked, if the mice had a bit more fat tissue? They transplanted fat tissue into the rodents, and two weeks later, the mice had normal levels of glucose, insulin and triglycerides. Their livers and muscles went back to normal, too. If that worked, the scientists wondered, could a limitless amount of fat tissue prevent the syndrome, even if copious amounts of fat were stored in that tissue? Philipp E. Scherer, the director of the Touchstone Diabetes Center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, and his colleagues tested the idea. They engineered mice that could make an almost limitless amount of fat tissue. As a result, there was no end to the amount of fat the animals could store. They were, Dr. Scherer said, ""the fattest mice under the sun, the mouse equivalent of an 800-pound human being.""

Now, with years of research, the picture has become clear. And so has a new view of the role of fat itself in causing the medical problems of obesity. At the heart of all these conditions and what is known as ""metabolic syndrome,"" or having at least three of the conditions associated with obesity, is an inadequate ability to store fat. (Dr. C. Ronald Kahn, the chief academic officer of the Joslin Diabetes Clinic, said two German physicians called the syndrome ""metabolic"" nearly 40 years ago. Conditions like elevated cholesterol, diabetes and even high blood pressure appear to be linked through disruptions in metabolism, in this case the abnormal storage of calories.) The body turns excess food into fat and tries to store it in fat tissue. If there is not enough fat tissue, the fat is stuffed into other organs, like the liver and the heart, as well as the muscles and the pancreas. There it poisons the body, causing metabolic syndrome. Fat people develop metabolic disorders because their brain is driving them to eat more food than their bodies can store as fat. Their fat tissue has reached its limit. People with lipodystrophy have so little fat tissue that they, too, cannot store the fat their body makes to store extra calories from the food they eat. This is also why some people find that their metabolic disorders improve with just a small weight loss -- they are eating less and their fat tissue can respond properly.

It also explains why 10 percent to 20 percent of obese people never develop metabolic disorders, Dr. Scherer said. These so-called healthy obese are like his fat mice, with an unusual ability to expand their fat tissue to store calories. Now researchers have moved on to the next phase of the investigation, trying to identify the poison in fat that is causing all these problems and find a way to block it. At least two chemicals seem to be involved. Dr. Gerald I. Shulman, a Yale professor of medicine and co-director of the Diabetes Research Center there, and an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, has focused on diacylglycerol, produced from fatty acids -- made from the food a person eats -- and deposited in places like the muscles and liver instead of fat tissue. With diacylglycerol, Dr. Shulman found, insulin cannot signal cells. The result is insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. ""Diacylglycerol is the culprit,"" he says. One sure way to get rid of it in liver and muscle cells is to lose weight -- to stop providing the body with more calories than its fat tissue can handle, he notes. That is not so easy. ""Every patient I see, I say, 'Let's lose some weight and increase activity.' They all nod their heads. 'That's a great idea.' Maybe one in 100 does it, and even when they are successful, we know how easy it is to gain the weight back."" Dr. Shulman is exploring another route, developing benign new variants of a toxic drug that he hopes will be safe and will reduce levels of fat and inflammation in the liver. The drug, dinitrophenol, was once widely used as an over-the counter medication for weight loss, but the Food and Drug Administration took it off the market in 1938 after a few people taking it dropped dead from severely high body temperatures. He and his colleagues have modified dinitrophenol so, at least in rats, it does not raise body temperature or cause weight loss. But it lowers diacylglycerol levels in the liver and cures Type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and other metabolic problems associated with obesity.

The problem will be developing it for humans. Would people want to be in a clinical trial using a variant of a drug that originally had potentially lethal side effects? ""This is a proof of concept,"" Dr. Shulman says. ""I do think this is a way forward."" Others are focusing on another class of compounds, called ceramides. Dr. Scherer, who is studying them, says they are produced from fat floating in the blood and are unable to get into fat tissue for storage or degradation. They, too, cause insulin resistance. Ceramides can also kill cells if their levels become high and can bring on inflammatory responses. And inflammation, Dr. Scherer adds, is a hallmark of obesity. He and others are looking for the best drugs to stanch the activity of enzymes used to make ceramides. Like Dr. Shulman, he finds that he can show that his idea works in mice. But, he says, ""that's easy to do in a mouse."" All of this raises a provocative question. ""It is so accepted that obesity is bad for you, but why is it bad for you?"" Dr. Virtue says. ""If I put a 50-pound weight on your back and asked you to walk around all day, you would be a superhealthy person."" And that, says Dr. Rudolph Leibel of Columbia University, is the beauty of the work on lipodystrophy. People like Ms. Johnson have shown a pathway that leads to the diseases of obesity. ""The first step toward curing it is to know why,"" Dr. Leibel says.",A small group of thin patients who develop disorders typically tied to obesity pose a medical mystery and a potential opportunity for scientists.,34ff5f0e-3d36-5af8-9400-a13f9feed639,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/29/science/FAT2/FAT2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=20fa0e8ab85fb888f5f6b04c8e6f27ea72c76a1337bac78f4d7fb926a0e1cbe7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Claire Walker Johnson, 55, of Queens, developed Type 2 diabetes and a fatty liver, among other problems related to obesity, despite weighing only 119 pounds.

Real Estate,The Private-School Sales Bump on the Upper East Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/realestate/the-private-school-sales-bump-on-the-upper-east-side.html,"For the next several weeks, many New York City families will be in a state of apprehension as private schools begin sending out their acceptance letters. There is not much for them to do. They have already written essays expounding on their 3-year-old's passion for Thomas the Tank Engine; sat nervously for interviews with admissions officers; and dreamed of their child's successes while touring hallowed halls of learning. All that is left is to scan the mail each day for the telltale thick envelope announcing their child has been accepted to his first-choice school. With many of the city's private schools on the Upper East Side, the opening of acceptance letters can lead some families that live elsewhere to wrestle with whether to uproot themselves and relocate closer to school. Many answer in the affirmative, and their next step is to call a broker.

""People are much more willing to commute for work than they are to their children's school,"" said Kristina Kaplan Wallison, an agent at Stribling & Associates who relocated with her family to the Upper East Side from downtown after her daughter was accepted to a school in the area. That is why Ms. Wallison had no trouble recognizing the trend when she saw it at Philip House, a condominium at 141 East 88th Street, where she is a director of sales.

The building, where roughly 65 percent of the apartments have three or more bedrooms and where a five-bedroom is on the market for $9.75 million, is seeing a surge of buyer interest from families looking to relocate to get closer to a private school. ""One family just got the good news that their child was accepted where they wanted to go, and the next day they called us and said they needed to find something,"" Ms. Wallison said. ""People are starting to look in earnest now because the process can take a few months, and they want to move in by the time school starts in September."" Springtime is generally a period when the real estate sales market picks up, driven by a multitude of factors, perhaps most significantly bonus season, when financial firms dole out cash to employees. It is also a time when more sellers and new developments come to market, and buyers emerge from hibernation as the weather warms. But another critical factor driving the uptick, brokers say, is the so-called private school bump. Families typically buy larger apartments, and an analysis of data shows that on the Upper East Side, bigger homes make up a substantial percentage of sales during this period, compared with the rest of the year. In 2014, from January through April, condominiums with three or more bedrooms made up 34 percent of the sales on the Upper East Side, compared with 29 percent during the rest of the year, according to data from Corcoran Sunshine. In the first four months of 2013, condos with three or more bedrooms made up the same proportion of sales, 34 percent, versus 31 percent during the rest of the year. ""It is hard to isolate the reason, but if you look from January to April, large residences definitely comprised more of the sales than during the rest of the year,"" said Ryan Schleis, a vice president of research and analytics at Corcoran Sunshine.

The sales pitch for Carnegie Park, at 200 East 94th Street, is based in part on the building's walking distance to several private schools, including the Nightingale-Bamford School and the Dalton School. ""Schools are a very big draw for the demographic we have been catering to,"" said Sherry Tobak, a senior vice president of Related Sales, the marketing and sales division of the Related Companies, the developer. Carnegie Park started out as a 368-unit rental, but Related is in the process of converting the apartments into condominiums as leases expire. Wherever possible, Related is combining several units to create larger homes to cater to the demand. When the building is fully converted later this year, Related estimates there will be fewer than 300 apartments. ""We started out with one-, two- and a few three-bedrooms, but the largest demand is for three-bedrooms, four-bedrooms and even five-bedrooms, which we are calling uber combos,"" Ms. Tobak said. ""We are creating larger apartments wherever we can."" The four-bedrooms are 1,880 square feet and priced in the high-$2 million to the low-$3 million range. In the five weeks since it began sales, Carnegie Park has had more than 65 contracts out or signed. At the Carlton House at 21 East 61st Street, where the majority of apartments have three to six bedrooms and are priced at an average of $4,000 a square foot, the experience has been much the same. The building has been marketing units for a year, and ""last spring, we had buyers coming from downtown, mostly Battery Park City and TriBeCa, because their kids were coming to school in the neighborhood,"" said Elida Jacobsen Justo, the building's director of sales. ""We expect to see that happen this year again.""

While this mother might be jumping the gun, the family is also driven by the Upper East Side value play. They recently lost a bidding war after offering $2.7 million for a two-bedroom at the Stewart House at 70 East 10th Street that was listed at $2.55 million. ""I just sent them a fairly comparable property asking $1.85 million on Third Avenue, so it is far more affordable,"" Ms. Froelich said. Inventory on the Upper East Side is tight, with just 1,291 listings on the market, significantly fewer than the long-term average for the neighborhood, according to data from Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm. ""If you only want to stay within a certain grid, between Fifth and Park in the 60s and 70s, it is extremely limited,"" said Frances Katzen, a broker at Douglas Elliman Real Estate, referring to the Upper East Side's most exclusive and coveted area. With inventory low, some buyers might venture farther east to more affordable addresses along or beyond Third Avenue, or head across the park to Central Park West. While going to the West Side can mean a longer commute, some families nonetheless prefer it and rely on drivers to ferry their children to school each day, Ms. Katzen said. Some ""will say that if they can't be on Park or Fifth, they would rather be on Central Park West and stay close to the park than go to Third Avenue,"" she added. While the bulk of private schools are on the East Side, there are also some high-profile schools on the Upper West Side, including the Trinity School and the Collegiate School. Michele Kleier, the president of Kleier Residential, has a client who has always lived on the East Side but is finding herself looking west because her children may be going to school there. ""She has been on the East Side forever, but now she is considering the West Side,"" Ms. Kleier said. ""But she wants something in good condition, so if she hates it, she can sell right away and move back.""","When Upper East Side private schools send out acceptance letters, brokers begin to field calls from families considering a move to the area.",dacf7db0-bd09-5ef4-9b83-a5a68e681cf8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/15/realestate/15DEAL1/15DEAL1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=db6e229fb99f3a3cffb894a0f7da91d4b23e9a513c960223e24ad30b41796279&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Philip House, where more than half the apartments have three or more bedrooms, is seeing a surge of interest from families.",dacf7db0-bd09-5ef4-9b83-a5a68e681cf8,N24News/imgs/dacf7db0-bd09-5ef4-9b83-a5a68e681cf8.jpg,7
Health,Trump Administration Plans to Ban Flavored E-Cigarettes,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/health/trump-vaping.html,"WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration said on Wednesday that it would ban the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes, at a time when hundreds of people have been sickened by mysterious lung illnesses and teenage vaping continues to rise. Sitting in the Oval Office with the government's top health officials, President Trump acknowledged that there was a vaping problem and said: ""We can't allow people to get sick. And we can't have our kids be so affected."" Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, said that the Food and Drug Administration would outline a plan within the coming weeks for removing flavored e-cigarettes and nicotine pods from the market, excluding tobacco flavors. The ban would include mint and menthol, popular varieties that manufacturers have argued should not be considered flavors. The White House and the F.D.A. have faced mounting pressure from lawmakers, public health officials, parents and educators, who have grown alarmed by the popularity of vaping among teenagers but have felt powerless to keep e-cigarettes away from students and out of schools.

This summer's startling reports of vaping-related respiratory illnesses, which now near 500 cases in nearly three dozen states and have possible links to six deaths, have only amplified concerns and renewed calls for a total ban on the largely unregulated pipeline of e-cigarette and cannabis vaping products. Just last week, Michigan became the first state to prohibit the sale of flavored e-cigarettes. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York also called for a ban, and Massachusetts and California are considering similar measures. San Francisco approved an e-cigarette ban earlier this year, which Juul Labs, the dominant seller in the United States, is lobbying to reverse through a ballot initiative this November. [Is it time to quit vaping?] Last year, the F.D.A. retreated from a threat to prohibit the sale of e-cigarettes as the increased rates of teenage use took public health experts by surprise. Public outrage stoked by accusations that Juul Labs was deliberately targeting youths led the company to voluntarily stop shipping most flavored pods, like mango and cucumber, to thousands of retail locations around the country. Agency officials had hoped that making flavored products less accessible would reduce teenage use of the popular devices, but instead the latest figures show another increase in youth vaping, Mr. Azar said, after meeting with the president on Wednesday. Five million minors, mostly in their high school years, reported that they had used e-cigarettes recently, he said. About one-quarter of the nation's high school students reported vaping within the last 30 days in this year's annual survey, up from 20 percent last year.

Speaking to reporters on the White House lawn, Mr. Azar said that removing flavor pods from stores just prompted youths to shift from fruit flavors to menthol and mint, which were still available, rather than to stop vaping altogether. ""What we've seen has been, and it may be connected, a huge spiking of children's utilization of mint and menthol e-cigarettes, which remain, by all manufacturers, available in retail stores,"" Mr. Azar said. The issue appeared to hit home at the White House, where Melania Trump attended the meeting with Mr. Azar, Dr. Ned Sharpless, the acting F.D.A. commissioner and the president. ""She's got a son,"" Mr. Trump said of their teenage child, Barron. ""She feels very strongly about it,"" he said. Juul has repeatedly denied that it aimed its products at minors, but its sleek devices have become more and more popular and are easy to conceal. And even though the company's array of flavors had disappeared from shelves, they were still available online, and a host of competitors sprouted up with lookalike versions and similar flavors to fill the vacuum. Juul had said that nearly 85 percent of its sales were from mint and other flavors, and that its decision to stop shipping them to stores had dented their sales. On Monday, the F.D.A. took action against Juul, sending a warning letter accusing the company of violating federal regulations by promoting its vaping products as a healthier option than cigarettes. As for the agency's decision to prohibit most flavors, Ted Kwong, a Juul spokesman, said the company would comply. ""We strongly agree with the need for aggressive category-wide action on flavored products,"" he said. Public health groups have long clamored for strict curbs on e-cigarettes and flavors, especially because they worried that the soaring use among youths was hooking a new generation on nicotine after decades of a decline in smoking rates.

Matthew L. Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the administration's decision ""historic."" ""President Trump's announcement that the government will remove flavored e-cigarettes from the market is an extraordinary and necessary step,"" he said. ""This is a public health crisis and we cannot afford more delays in confronting it."" Harold Wimmer, president and chief executive of the American Lung Association, said the group had long advocated removal of products that appealed to teenagers. ""Flavors have been shown to initiate kids to tobacco use and a lifetime of addiction and tobacco-related death and disease,"" Mr. Wimmer said. ""We are anxious to review all of the details of the administration's plan.""

Conservative organizations and the vaping industry had earlier joined forces to oppose other F.D.A. proposals, including one that sought to require retailers to curb access to vaping devices, pods and other paraphernalia to keep them away from minors. Since last fall, the agency has been working on a plan to require stores to sequester flavored e-cigarettes in areas off-limits to minors, but that had seemed to falter as impractical and one that would face significant legal hurdles. This new announcement supersedes that proposal. Since Dr. Scott Gottlieb resigned as F.D.A. commissioner in April, the agency had seemed more sluggish in its efforts to control the epidemic of youth vaping. Although Dr. Sharpless had said he planned to continue the agency's work to reduce both cigarette and e-cigarette use, not much moved forward. Dr. Gottlieb's proposal to ban menthol in cigarettes, for example, has languished, as has his call for reducing nicotine in cigarettes to nonaddictive levels.

But as school began around the country and the spate of illnesses sparked fear nationwide, calls for the F.D.A. to take stronger action intensified. Senator Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois and a longtime opponent of tobacco and e-cigarettes, went so far last week as to warn that he would seek Dr. Sharpless's resignation if the agency failed to rid the market of e-cigarette flavors. Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, also decided to weigh in this week by announcing a $160 million push to ban flavored e-cigarettes. In a statement on Tuesday, the Vapor Technology Association, a trade group, said it opposed a flavor ban and essentially called the efforts misguided. ""More than two million Americans have died from cigarette smoking-related illnesses over the last five years,"" the organization said. ""President Trump shouldn't follow the lead of San Francisco, Mike Bloomberg and the far left anti-business extremists."" But there is little conclusive research on the long-term safety of using Juul or other e-cigarettes. The company's flavor pods have a higher level of nicotine than cigarettes do, which is of concern because of the impact nicotine can have on the still-developing teenage brain. Doctors have said that many patients suffering from acute lung illnesses appear to have vaped some THC or cannabis-related products, although others have reported using e-cigarettes as well . No one has singled out a particular company, device or product as the possible culprit.

Deaths have been reported in Illinois, Kansas, California, Indiana, Minnesota and Oregon. The patients' ages ranged from the 30s to middle-aged or older, and some had underlying lung or other chronic conditions, health officials said. And while major e-cigarette companies like Juul and vaping groups have sought to distance themselves from the increasing public dismay at the reports of increasing vaping-related illnesses, some public health agencies are urging a halt to use of the devices and products. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have urged people, especially nonsmokers and teenagers, not to vape at all. And the C.D.C. has even recommended that cigarette smokers trying to quit should consult a doctor rather than take up e-cigarettes. One House oversight panel has asked Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the C.D.C., to appear on Sept. 24 to testify about the outbreak of vaping-related lung illnesses. Another investigative subcommittee is planning a separate hearing on the matter the next day. In New York, Governor Cuomo also directed state health officials to subpoena companies that market or sell so-called thickening agents, which are sometimes added to illicit vaping products. A state laboratory, which detected the agents in vaping products collected from New York's patients, found that they were nearly pure vitamin E acetate oil, which officials have said is a potential cause of some of the illnesses.","As vaping-related illnesses spread, President Trump and top health officials met at the White House to discuss ways to keep the products away from teenagers.",5cfdccb4-731a-5421-958f-936488add71f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/11/science/11ECIGARETTES/11ECIGARETTES-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=0e4207d362b56f30d619023b073b3ae426f7b3de08d59adbd616daeef50e635a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Various flavors of Juul e-cigarettes in a store in Manhattan.,5cfdccb4-731a-5421-958f-936488add71f,N24News/imgs/5cfdccb4-731a-5421-958f-936488add71f.jpg,1
Movies,The Technical Stars Who Help Pull Off a Christopher Nolan Narrative,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/27/movies/christopher-nolan-film-editing.html,"Kenneth Branagh in a scene from ""Tenet,"" directed by Christopher Nolan, who prefers practical effects over digital ones.





""Tenet"" is only the latest film by Christopher Nolan to play with time and complicated action. ""Inception,"" ""Dunkirk"" and the Dark Knight installments all aimed for new heights in tightly coordinated suspense and spectacle. But how do the makers of these mind-boggling films pull it all together? The mastermind is unquestionably Nolan, but he is not alone. The multiple narratives, the military-grade action set pieces, the unforgiving studio production schedules all demand masterminds in addition to the director. I spoke with a few of the filmmaker's collaborators, past and present, to understand what it takes to make his visions a reality -- or an unreality, as the case may be.

Twenty years ago, ""Memento"" made Nolan a director to watch and introduced his penchant for slicing and dicing narrative. Dody Dorn was the Academy Award-nominated editor of the hit, which recounted in reverse the story of an amnesiac caught up in murderous intrigue. Dorn had to assemble Nolan's clockwork mystery for audiences who didn't know what to expect. Her work in ""Memento"" underlined the importance of psychological purpose behind Nolan's approach. ""The point of view and the lack of information that you get by telling a story out of chronological order allows you to empathize with the main character, Leonard,"" Dorn said. Not knowing the extent of Leonard's violent actions and motives leaves us open to understanding this conflicted figure. When his vigilantism is revealed, the puzzle carries an emotional payload beyond the frisson of a mere twist. The pause-and-rewind premise of ""Memento"" bears a definite family resemblance to the forward-and-backward conceit of ""Tenet,"" not to mention the nested storytelling of ""Inception"" and ""The Prestige."" All of these movies require careful calibration. It's a matter of withholding just enough to keep things interesting. In ""Memento,"" that meant replaying a few seconds of the previous scene, but not a second too much.

As a point of comparison, Dorn mentioned another director who is known for innovative editing: Paul Greengrass, who shook up the Jason Bourne series with splintered perspectives. To Dorn's eyes, Greengrass's approach is ""more prismatic,"" whereas Nolan's is ""visceral in the frame, rather than visceral in the editing."" It's a subtle but intriguing distinction between Greengrass's sensation of being in the moment, and a Nolan world that has a secret order being slowly revealed.

Dorn edited one more Nolan feature, ""Insomnia,"" but longer collaborations are more typical. Lee Smith has been the editor on many Nolan projects, orchestrating their multilevel crosscutting. Wally Pfister was the cinematographer on seven of his films, including ""Memento"" and ""Inception"" (2010), for which he won an Academy Award. But also key to these action-heavy movies is the stunt coordinator, George Cottle. Cottle began as a stuntman and drove the Batmobile through all manner of chaos in the ""Dark Knight"" movies. His role as coordinator is critical because Nolan prizes practical effects and in-camera stunts over computer-generated imagery as a way of creating the sense of physical bodies moving through actual space. Nolan's most eye-opening sequences have a bravura quality along with rising and converging tensions, and Cottle maintains the energy on the ground. He presents the filmmaker with ideas for particular moves and choreography in fight sequences, and receives step-by-step guidance from the director.

""For a fight in 'Tenet,' he might say, 'Look, in this part of the movie, John David is really coming into his own. So I just want to see full-on aggression, but I want a moment of weakness here, and then I want him to come back strong at the end. Maybe 20 to 25 seconds,'"" Cottle said, referring to the main character played by John David Washington. He singled out the film's Mumbai building-jumping sequence as especially nerve-racking. Since these elaborate scenes can end up on huge Imax screens, the team also learns to adjust shots for audience comprehension. ""With that size of screen, we had to hold on shots for a little longer,"" Pfister, the cinematographer, said. ""When you're watching this in such an immersive fashion, you need time to scan the screen."" ""And if it was going to be a really quick cut,"" he said, ""I needed a little more light to see things better because it's only going to be on the screen for a fleeting moment."" Many large productions use a separate filmmaking crew, a second unit, that can operate independently on action scenes. But Nolan prefers to direct those sequences himself. The resulting team, Cottle and other collaborators said, has a certain esprit du corps. ""There is a real sense when you're on set with him that Chris is the headmaster and everybody else is working to keep the headmaster happy,"" Cottle said.

A Hollywood veteran, Nilo Otero has been first assistant director for Nolan's movies since ""The Dark Knight"" (2008). It's a behind-the-scenes role that doesn't receive much attention, but its existence frees up the filmmaker to do his job. Otero breaks down the script for Nolan's review, and that can entail working out shooting days, wrangling actors and even scheduling around the ocean tides. ""You see all those guys on that beach in 'Dunkirk,' right? That beach disappears twice a day. OK, now schedule that!"" Otero said. ""The pier is a really great set, but nevertheless an obvious set once you look at it when the tide is low."" Otero views Nolan as a rarity when it comes to blockbusters: an old-school filmmaker who can attend to all facets of production rather than specializing and who still prefers shooting with a single camera. (""I don't know if they're the biggest little movies in the world or the littlest big movies in the world, but it's like you had an unlimited student film,"" Otero said, approvingly.) Nolan's level of involvement helps give his films a personal stamp, unlike some major studio productions. It also means that the usual Hollywood waltzes can break a little differently. Take, for example, hashing out actor availability.","In films like ""Memento"" and ""Inception,"" the director's time shifts and intricate action require careful calibration by editors, stunt performers and others.",31923508-8414-55c6-bea3-02a65c151429,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/28/arts/22nolan-editing1/22nolan-editing1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=d883f009d8c98b0490b01f07af1d36dd1376afb5e2add6a2044ba644271c7c21&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Kenneth Branagh in a scene from &ldquo;Tenet,&rdquo; directed by Christopher Nolan, who prefers practical effects over digital ones.",31923508-8414-55c6-bea3-02a65c151429,N24News/imgs/31923508-8414-55c6-bea3-02a65c151429.jpg,5
Books,The Highs and Lows of LSD Literature,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/books/lsd-books-pollan-waldman-doyle.html,"It can seem as though everyone in Silicon Valley is either heading to or coming back from a psychedelic trip, and it is probably Michael Pollan's fault. He did after all write a best seller, ""How to Change Your Mind,"" about how healthful psychedelics can be. His neighbor Ayelet Waldman, whose memoir ""A Really Good Day"" recounts how taking acid helped her mood and marriage, has something to do with it, too. And now, inspired by Pollan, the writer T.C. Boyle has a new novel, ""Outside Looking In,"" about Timothy Leary, the charismatic Harvard professor turned psychedelics pied piper of the 1960s. In the past year, psychedelics have entered the mainstream conversation in a way not seen since then. But now LSD and magic mushrooms aren't for fun or adventure, but for wellness, life-hacking, therapy and self-care. The Milken Conference, a business event featuring the leaders of major banks, had a panel called ""Psychedelics: Mind-Enhancing Methods to Well-Being."" There is a seemingly endless array of psychedelic health events. And no group has embraced psychedelics like Silicon Valley engineers. On a recent afternoon, Waldman, who like Pollan lives in Berkeley, came to his house for lunch. The two had gotten into psychedelics only in their 50s, and their interest was a mix of academic, spiritual and therapeutic . Boyle, in town for his book tour, joined. Unlike the other two, Boyle had used drugs liberally in his youth and entirely for fun. (Boyle is recently retired from teaching writing at U.S.C., though he prefers the term ""pre-dead."") Over lunch, the three talked about the flood of freshly minted shamans, Gwyneth Paltrow's wellness brand Goop and whether hallucinogens belong at company gatherings.

'These people became shamans, like, last week' Hallucinogens can be a particularly jarring, grueling high, and Pollan and Waldman both took the drugs with shaman guides in undisclosed locations . (The drugs are still illegal, after all.) Both found the experience to be life changing, giving them new insights into themselves and their lives. Now they worry about how many people are following their lead . A booming -- and unregulated -- shaman market has emerged. ""Now when you leave the airport in Quito, there are people with signs for 'ayahuasca ceremony' instead of 'taxi,'"" Pollan said. ""These people became shamans, like, last week. People are getting hurt."" It's not as if there's a licensing board. All the guys Pollan knew before are booked months out. Suddenly a lot more people are calling themselves experts. Plus, there is the tricky issue of American wellness seekers taking over South American spiritual ceremonies.

It's a complicated concern for two people who have just published books about the benefits of psychedelics. They worry about the ayahuasca retreat gentrification even as they usher more people in the door. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

Boyle, who wears a goatee and shaggy hair, does not worry as much about this as his Berkeley friends do. Nor does he share the same shamanic spiritual experiences or drug-related wellness goals. ""Me, I was just a druggie -- I wasn't looking for enlightenment,"" Boyle said. ""The LSD we took, the mescaline and so on, it's just bought f rom some guy on the street corner, we didn't know what it was."" The new psychedelic movement -- in which microdosing is for productivity -- would not approve. And the booming wellness industry is ready with promises of what psychedelics can do for you (spoiler alert: almost everything). Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow's health and beauty brand, now regularly features pieces with voices touting the health benefits of the drugs, claiming MDMA makes talk therapy more effective or ayahuasca increases a person's appreciation of nature. ""The Goop-ification is happening,"" Waldman said. She seems skeptical. Waldman took on the soft but authoritative voice of a yoga instructor as she jokingly described how psychedelics might be rebranded. ""You know you take your jade egg, roll it in a little acid, and you shove it up your --,"" Waldman said, making a swift upward motion with her hand as everyone around the table laughed. ""Absorb it through your mucous membranes and it gives you a kind of extraordinary experience.""

""Do you guys think Trump has something to do with it?"" Pollan called from the kitchen where he was heating up pizza from the The Cheese Board Collective in Berkeley. ""I couldn't get through Trump without something,"" Waldman responded. Pollan argues that the new interest in psychedelics comes from the growing anxiety in American society today -- and not just from the erratic president. ""I think people want these kind of more intense experiences than they're getting being online,"" Pollan said. The very people who funded the screens are now backing the things to cure people from their effects. Venture capitalists are getting involved as a new gold rush stirs. Unusual new financiers are finding common cause with would-be hippies. The conservative investor Peter Thiel is backing a psychedelics-for-wellness start-up. Pollan is now spending at least some of his time trying to stop people from using psychedelics at corporate off-sites. At a recent psychedelic conference at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, he met a 20-something entrepreneur whose start-up had closed a large round of funding and was now hiring. ""He'd come to the conference because he thought he could use psychedelics in his management training,"" Pollan said. ""And I tried to give him some cautionary notes. Like, 'You know, you may want to go public one day.'""

Waldman argued that it could be a good idea to incorporate psychedelics into a company off-site, ""as long as it's not compulsory."" But no one at the table that day in Berkeley was arguing for full legalization. Pollan, who wrote extensively and positively about his time using psilocybin, wrote an op-ed in May warning against legalization after Colorado effectively decriminalized it. ""Psilocybin has a lot of potential as medicine, but we don't know enough about it yet to legalize it,"" Pollan wrote. ""The lesson from ancient cultures that use psychedelics in their healing or their religion is that they always have a kind of container and an elder involved,"" Pollan said. ""You did them on certain occasions, and you did it with the clear intent."" Waldman's book focused on her experience microdosing, which in her case meant taking small amounts of LSD while continuing her daily life. She said microdosing should probably have different rules. But then again, someone could just take a bunch of microdoses and get high.","Psychedelics are back, now in the language of health and wellness. Michael Pollan, Ayelet Waldman, and T.C. Boyle weigh in.",5f57efc4-b0a8-5bab-975a-08d86f41d3d4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/14/books/14LSDLIT1/00LSDLIT1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=9fb8cb7776ff24bc04850746624fbda95c4fce72f772f1e5af8ad6d381d0a6c6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, the writers T.C.

Music,"12 Pop, Rock and Jazz Concerts to Check Out in N.Y.C. This Weekend",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/arts/music/nyc-this-weekend-pop-rock-jazz.html,"EMMET COHEN TRIO at Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola (April 16, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Cohen, 28, has a breezy, phlegmatic command at the keyboard, and a deep well of historical jazz references at his fingertips. He has worked as a side musician for such luminaries as Christian McBride and Herlin Riley, and has recorded with the elder statesmen Ron Carter and Jimmy Cobb. If he wasn't already an obvious heir apparent to the neo-traditional jazz mantle, his win at last weekend's 2019 American Pianists Awards ought to make it official. At Dizzy's, he will be joined by the bassist Philip Norris and the drummer Kyle Poole. They will draw some of the night's material from Cohen's recent trio album, ""Dirty in Detroit.""

MIHO HAZAMA AND M_UNIT at Jazz Standard (April 17, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). The crossbreeding of classical and jazz has a long history, stretching back to the Third Stream movement of the 1960s. And new approaches to this amalgam have been thick on the ground of late: Just try to count how many young jazz musicians are writing for string quartet these days. One of the boldest thinkers and most delightful composers in this vein is Hazama, who studied Western classical music in Japan before making the jump to jazz. Her chamber orchestra, m_unit, blends strings and horns and mallet percussion in service of her resplendent, highly singable compositions. At the Standard, the group will be playing selections from the recently released ""Dancer in Nowhere.""

BEN MONDER, TONY MALABY AND TOM RAINEY at Public Records (April 17, 8 p.m.). This newly opened music club, cafe and bar in Gowanus, Brooklyn, has a high-fidelity sound setup in two different rooms. In the back, which is laid out like a typical nightclub, electronic and experimental shows run throughout the week. Every Wednesday going forward, the barroom hosts a weekly jazz series. The group playing this Wednesday is a trio featuring three esteemed, New York-based improvisers with a long history of collaboration: the dark-toned, harmonically sophisticated guitarist Ben Monder, the undersung saxophone titan Tony Malaby and the roving, idiosyncratic drummer Tom Rainey.

BRANDON ROSS'S PHANTOM STATION at the Jazz Gallery (April 12, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Ross, a guitarist best known for his work in the jazz-rock power trio Harriet Tubman, doesn't just play a slew of different instruments (banjo, soprano guitar, regular old electric guitar, etc.), he also ranges freely from sweet and lyrical playing to wavy, confrontational distortion. Phantom Station is not a band; it's an opportunity for him to embrace his proclivity for newness and change. He performs under this name with a wide variety of collaborators and formations. On Friday, the ensemble will include Graham Haynes on cornet and electronics, J. T. Lewis (also a member of Harriet Tubman) on drums and Hardedge on sound design.

STRETCH MUSIC FESTIVAL at Harlem Stage Gatehouse (April 12, 7:30 p.m.). The trumpeter Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah is about to close the book on a three-year residency at Harlem Stage. As part of that, since 2017 he has convened an annual Stretch Music Festival, comprising educational events, discussions of art and activism, and performances. (The event's title is a reference to the way Scott refers to his own music; it's an effort to wriggle free from the limitations of genre.) He is coming off the release last month of ""Ancestral Recall,"" an impressive album on which West African-derived rhythms and whispery synthesizers fortify his bristling trumpet playing and the strident, subversive poetry of Saul Williams. Friday's festival will include performances by Scott, the saxophonist Logan Richardson and Freelance, a band that fuses contemporary R&B with backpacker hip-hop and jazz.

JOHN ZORN'S NEW MASADA QUARTET at the Village Vanguard (April 14, 3 p.m.). Last year, Zorn, the eminent alto saxophonist and downtown arts organizer, released ""The Book Beriah,"" the final portion of his 613-song epic, ""Masada,"" a collection of experimental, often lovely compositions based in Jewish folk song, klezmer and free jazz (613 is the number of commandments, or mitzvot, in the Torah). As is the wont of this serial collaborator, Zorn featured a different ensemble on each of ""Beriah's"" 10 CDs (11, including the bonus disc). Here he plays material from ""Masada"" in a new quartet featuring three talented improvisers: Julian Lage on guitar, Jorge Roeder on bass and Kenny Wollesen on drums.

Art & Design,34 Art Exhibitions to View in N.Y.C. This Weekend,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/arts/design/nyc-this-weekend-art-and-museums.html," 'APOLLO'S MUSE: THE MOON IN THE AGE OF PHOTOGRAPHY' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Sept. 22). This exhibition is a journey through an uncommon history, that of representations of the moon across four centuries. An outsize and beautifully installed revelation of persistent astronomical searches, it is a trailblazing marriage of science and art -- 300 images and objects (a telescope, a photograph used as a fire screen, two moon globes, Hasselblad cameras used by astronauts), plus film excerpts. The images shine a bright light on astronomers' unstoppable pursuit of knowledge as well as on technological advances, artistic responses and fantasy, and also a generous serving of unabashed cuteness. The show amounts to a testament to the human drive to know and explore, and it quietly affirms the growing influence of visual representations of the moon from the invention of the telescope through the Apollo 11 moon landing 50 years ago. (Vicki Goldberg) 

212-535-7100, metmuseum.org 'ARTISTIC LICENSE: SIX TAKES ON THE GUGGENHEIM COLLECTION' at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (through Jan. 12). Displays that artists select from a museum's collection are almost inevitably interesting, revealing and valuable. After all, artists can be especially discerning regarding work not their own. Here, six artists -- Cai Guo-Qiang, Paul Chan, Richard Prince, Julie Mehretu, Carrie Mae Weems and Jenny Holzer -- guided by specific themes, have chosen, which multiplies the impact accordingly. With one per ramp, each selection turns the museum inside out. The combination sustains multiple visits; the concept should be applied regularly. (Roberta Smith) 

212-423-3840, guggenheim.org 'AUSCHWITZ. NOT LONG AGO. NOT FAR AWAY' at the Museum of Jewish Heritage (through Jan. 3). Killing as a communal business, made widely lucrative by the Third Reich, permeates this traveling exhibition about the largest German death camp, Auschwitz, whose yawning gatehouse, with its converging rail tracks, has become emblematic of the Holocaust. Well timed, during a worldwide surge of anti-Semitism, the harrowing installation strives, successfully, for fresh relevance. The exhibition illuminates the topography of evil, the deliberate designing of a hell on earth by fanatical racists and compliant architects and provisioners, while also highlighting the strenuous struggle for survival in a place where, as Primo Levi learned, ""there is no why."" (Ralph Blumenthal) 

646-437-4202, mjhnyc.org 'BRAZILIAN MODERN: THE LIVING ART OF ROBERTO BURLE MARX' at the New York Botanical Garden (through Sept. 29). The garden's largest-ever botanical exhibition pays tribute to Brazil's most renowned landscape architect with lush palm trees and vivid plants, along with a display of paintings and tapestries. In the late 1960s and early '70s, Marx (1909-94) planted bright bands of monochrome plants along Rio's Copacabana Beach and the fresh ministries of Brasilia, then the new capital. For this show, the garden and its greenhouses synthesize his achievements into a free-form paean rich with Brazilian species, some of which he discovered himself. (Alcantarea burle-marxii, one of many thick-fronded bromeliads here, has leaves as tall as a 10-year-old.) Check the weather, make sure it's sunny, then spend all day breathing in this exuberant gust of tropical modernism. (Jason Farago)

'PIERRE CARDIN: FUTURE FASHION' at the Brooklyn Museum (through Jan. 5). He was never a great artist like Dior, Balenciaga or Saint Laurent, but Pierre Cardin -- still at work at 97 -- pioneered today's approach to the business of fashion: take a loss on haute couture, then make the real money through ready-to-wear and worldwide licensing deals. He excelled at bold, futuristic day wear: belted unisex jumpsuits, vinyl miniskirts, dresses accessorized with astronaut-chic Plexiglas helmets. Other ensembles, especially the tacky evening gowns souped up with metal armature, are best ignored. All told, Cardin comes across as a relentless optimist about humanity's future, which has a certain retro charm. Remember the future? (Farago) 

718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org 'CULTURE AND THE PEOPLE: EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO, 1969-2019' at El Museo del Barrio (through Sept. 29). This golden anniversary survey of wonderful art from the collection of a treasured East Harlem-based institution sounds a political note from the start, with works by figures who were crucial to the museum's earliest years, like the street photographer Hiram Maristany and the great printmaker Rafael Tufino. Throughout the show, whether in abstract paintings or sculptural installations, art and activism blend. And there's joy: A 2006 collage called ""Barrio Boogie Movement"" by Rodriguez Calero generates the elation of the sidewalk it depicts, and Freddy Rodriguez's homage to the Dominican catcher Tony Pena -- a gold-leaf baseball nestled in a mink-lined glove -- is a rush of pure fan love. (Holland Cotter) 

212-831-7272, elmuseo.org 'CYCLING IN THE CITY: A 200-YEAR HISTORY' at the Museum of the City of New York (through Oct. 6). The complex past, present and future roles of the bicycle as a vehicle for both social progress and strife are explored in this exhibition. With more than 150 objects -- including 14 bicycles and vintage cycling apparel -- it traces the transformation of cycling's significance from a form of democratized transportation, which gave women and immigrants a sense of freedom, to a political football that continues to pit the city's more than 800,000 cyclists against their detractors today. (Julianne McShane) 

212-534-1672, mcny.org 'LEONARDO DA VINCI'S ""SAINT JEROME""' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 6). The 500th anniversary of da Vinci's death in 1519 will bring big doings to Paris this fall with a one-stop-only career survey at the Louvre. New York gets a shot of buzz in advance with the appearance at the Met of a single great painting: ""Saint Jerome Praying in the Wilderness."" On loan from the Vatican Museums, it's one of the most rawly expressive images in the da Vinci canon. And it's a mystery. We don't know exactly when it was painted, or for whom, or why. Like much of this artist's work, it's unfinished. Incompleteness is part of its power. And powerful this picture is, a spiritual meltdown unfolding right before your eyes. You won't want to miss it. (Cotter) 

212-535-7710, metmuseum.org 'DRAWING THE CURTAIN: MAURICE SENDAK'S DESIGNS FOR OPERA AND BALLET' at the Morgan Library & Museum (through Oct. 6). Drawn from Sendak's bequest to the Morgan of his theatrical drawings, this succinct yet bountiful exhibition offers an overview of a dense, underappreciated period in this artist's career, undertaken with his most celebrated books well in the past and his life in uneasy transition. ""Fifty,"" Sendak said, ""is a good time to either change careers or have a nervous breakdown."" The new midlife career he took on in the late 1970s was that of a designer for music theater. His rare ability to convey the light in darkness and the darkness in light brought him to opera. It's the focus of this show, which is aimed at adults but likely delightful for children, too. Five of his productions emerge before our eyes -- from rough sketches to storyboards, polished designs and a bit of video footage -- in those unmistakably Sendakian colors, watery and vivid at once. (Zachary Woolfe)

'ELECTIVE INFINITIES: EDMUND DE WAAL' at the Frick Collection (through Nov. 17). How does a contemporary artist enter a scene as formidable as Henry Frick's Gilded Age mansion? For de Waal, the English ceramist and author of the acclaimed family memoir ""The Hare With Amber Eyes,"" the answer is with modesty. Only as you follow de Waal's site-specific installations in nine of the museum's galleries does his own restrained music begin to ring out. Below Ingres's dangerously seductive ""Comtesse d'Haussonville,"" he installs little strips of solid gold leaning against two huddles of white porcelain; in the richly appointed West Gallery, two pairs of overlapping flat-screen-shaped glass boxes (""From Darkness to Darkness"" and ""Noontime and Dawntime"") distill the experience of being overwhelmed by painted imagery into a lucid kind of serenity. (Will Heinrich) 

212-288-0700, frick.org 'THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION' at the Museum of the Moving Image (ongoing). The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America's great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program ""Sam and Friends"" before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother's old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through ""Sesame Street"" and ""The Muppet Show,"" though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and storyboards and rediscover some old friends. (Farago)

 718-784-0077, movingimage.us 'ILLUSTRATING BATMAN: EIGHTY YEARS OF COMICS AND POP CULTURE' at the Society of Illustrators (through Oct. 12). Batman turned 80 in April, and now the character is being celebrated with this visual feast of covers and interior pages, teeming with vintage and modern original comic art that shows the hero's evolution. The exhibition includes ""Bat-Manga!: The Secret History of Batman in Japan,"" a display devoted to a Batman story originally printed in Japan, and ""Batman Collected: Chip Kidd's Batman Obsession,"" featuring memorabilia belonging to the graphic designer Chip Kidd. There will also be panel discussions on Sept. 12 and Oct. 3, and a commemoration of Batman Day on Sept. 21. (George Gene Gustines) 

212-838-2560, societyillustrators.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] 'ALICJA KWADE: PARAPIVOT' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 27). This shrewd and scientifically inclined artist, born in Poland and based in Berlin, has delivered the best edition in five years of the Met's hit-or-miss rooftop sculpture commission. Two tall armatures of interlocking steel rectangles, the taller of them rising more than 18 feet, support heavy orbs of different-colored marble; some of the balls perch precariously on the steel frames, while others, head-scratchingly, are squinched between them. Walk around these astral abstractions and the frames seem to become quotation marks for the transformed skyline of Midtown; the marbles might be planets, each just as precarious as the one from which they've been quarried. (Farago) 

212-535-7710, metmuseum.org 'SIMONE LEIGH: LOOPHOLE OF RETREAT' at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (through Oct. 27). Leigh's sensuous, majestic sculptures of black female figures fuse the language of African village architecture and African-American folk art, and sometimes racial stereotypes, like the ""mammy"" figurines produced and collected in earlier eras in America. Sculpture is only one part of the practice that earned Leigh the Hugo Boss Prize 2018, but it is the one that inspired this show of three large objects in a gallery off the rotunda. The title comes from the writings of Harriet Jacobs, an enslaved woman who spent seven years hiding in a crawl space to escape her master's advances. In the exhibition, the ""loophole"" becomes a kind of artistic conceit, too, in which Leigh moves deftly between mediums, styles and messages, addressing multiple audiences -- but always, as she has stated, black women. For Leigh, loopholes might include representations of women that link back to ancestors or empower women by drawing on the freedom available through art. In that sense, these sculptures are sentinels, and placeholders. (Martha Schwendener) 

212-423-3840, guggenheim.org 'LIFE: SIX WOMEN PHOTOGRAPHERS' at the New-York Historical Society (through Oct. 6). In the three-decade-plus golden age of Life magazine, only six of its full-time photographers were women. On the face of it, this exhibition at the historical society is half an excuse to air some gorgeous, previously unpublished silver prints, half a broad hint about how much talent we've lost to discrimination over the years. But cheery photo essays, produced by professional women, about other women hesitating to join the work force make a subtler point: that the actual mechanics of discrimination tend to be more complicated than they appear from a distance. (Heinrich)

'NATURE: COOPER HEWITT MUSEUM DESIGN TRIENNIAL' at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum (through Jan. 20). Plastics transformed the material world after World War II. Today, they pollute our oceans. A better future will be made with ... algae. Or bacteria. That's the dominant theme of this sweeping exhibition. On display here at the Smithsonian's temple to the culture of design are objects you might once have expected only at a science museum: Proteins found in silkworms are repurposed as surgical screws and optical lenses. Electronically active bacteria power a light fixture. The triennial displays some 60 projects and products from around the world that define a reconciliation of biosphere and technosphere, as Koert van Mensvoort, a Dutch artist and philosopher, puts it in the show's excellent catalog. ""Nature"" provides us with a post-consumption future, in which the urgency of restoring ecological function trumps the allure of the latest gadget. (James S. Russell) 

212-849-2950; cooperhewitt.org 'NOBODY PROMISED YOU TOMORROW: 50 YEARS AFTER STONEWALL' at the Brooklyn Museum (through Dec. 8). In this large group show, 28 young queer and transgender artists, most born after 1980, carry the buzz of Stonewall resistance into the present. Historical heroes, including Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, are honored (in a film by Sasha Wortzel and Tourmaline). Friends in life, Johnson and Rivera are tutelary spirits of an exhibition in which a trans presence, long marginalized by mainstream gay politics, is pronounced in the work of Juliana Huxtable, Hugo Gyrl, Amaryllis DeJesus Moleski and Elle Perez (who is also in the current Whitney Biennial).

718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org 'OCEAN WONDERS: SHARKS!' at the New York Aquarium (ongoing). For years, the aquarium's 14-acre campus hunkered behind a wall, turning its back to the beach. When aquarium officials last year finally got around to completing the long-promised building that houses this shark exhibition, maybe the biggest move, architecturally speaking, was breaking through that wall. The overall effect makes the aquarium more of a visible, welcoming presence along the boardwalk. Inside, ""Ocean Wonders"" features 115 species sharing 784,000 gallons of water. It stresses timely eco-consciousness, introducing visitors to shark habitats, explaining how critical sharks are to the ocean's food chains and ecologies, debunking myths about the danger sharks pose to people while documenting the threats people pose to sharks via overfishing and pollution. The narrow, snaking layout suggests an underwater landscape carved by water. Past the exit, an outdoor ramp inclines visitors toward the roof of the building, where the Atlantic Ocean suddenly spreads out below. You can see Luna Park in one direction, Brighton Beach in the other. The architectural point becomes clear: Sharks aren't just movie stars and aquarium attractions. They're also our neighbors -- as much a part of Coney Island as the roller coasters and summer dreams. (Michael Kimmelman) 

718-265-3474, nyaquarium.com 'PHENOMENAL NATURE: MRINALINI MUKHERJEE' at the Met Breuer (through Sept. 29). You almost forget that art has the power to startle -- to make you wonder ""How on earth did someone even think to do this, never mind do it?"" -- until you see a show like this survey of sculptures by Mukherjee (1949-2015), an Indian artist. Roughly half are figurelike forms made from hemp ropes worked in a knotted macrame technique of finger-aching ingenuity and titled with generic names of pre-Hindu nature spirits and fertility deities. Smaller, ceramic pieces, flame shaped and midnight black, suggest Buddhas. Late cast bronze sculptures look both botanical and bestial. The result isn't folk art or design or fiber art or religious art or feminist art. It's modern art of deep originality. And it's an astonishment. (Cotter)

'PLAY IT LOUD: INSTRUMENTS OF ROCK & ROLL' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 1). Presented in collaboration with the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, this exhibition offers a vision of history in which the rock music that flowered in the 1960s and '70s sits firmly at the center. The format of the rock band provides the structure of the show, with one room given over to the rhythm section and another showcasing ""Guitar Gods."" Yet another room has a display highlighting the guitar's destruction, with pieces of instruments trashed by Kurt Cobain and Pete Townshend. To the extent that it shifts focus toward the tools of the rock trade, the show is illuminating. Of particular interest is the room set aside for ""Creating a Sound,"" which focuses on the sonic possibility of electronics. The lighting in ""Play It Loud"" is dim, perhaps reflecting rock music as the sound of the night. Each individual instrument shines like a beacon, as if it's catching the glint of an onstage spotlight. It makes the space between audience member and musician seem vast, but that doesn't diminish the wonder of browsing the tools once used by pop royalty. (Mark Richardson) 

212-535-7710, metmuseum.org 'PUNK LUST: RAW PROVOCATION 1971-1985' at the Museum of Sex (through Nov. 30). This show begins with imagery from the Velvet Underground: The 1963 paperback of that title, an exploration of what was then called deviant sexual behavior and gave the band its name, is one of the first objects on display. Working through photos, album art and fliers by artists like Iggy Pop, the New York Dolls, Patti Smith and, yes, the Sex Pistols, the exhibition demonstrates how punk offered a space for sexual expression outside the mainstream. In the story told by ""Punk Lust,"" much of it laid out in placards by the writer and musician Vivien Goldman, one of the show's curators, graphic sexual imagery is a tool for shock that frightens away the straight world and offers comfort to those who remain inside. While some of the power dynamic is typical -- underage groupies cavorting with rock stars -- images from female, queer and nonbinary artists like Jayne County and the Slits make a strong case for sex as an essential source of punk liberation. (Richardson) 

212-689-6337, museumofsex.com 'SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION' at the Jewish Museum (ongoing). After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike -- Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilettantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago) 

212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org STATUE OF LIBERTY MUSEUM on Liberty Island (ongoing). Security concerns stemming from the Sept. 11 attacks led the National Park Service to restrict the number of people who could go inside the Statue of Liberty's massive stone pedestal and up to the crown. So the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation wanted to offer something more for visitors who found the outdoor view less than satisfying: a stand-alone museum on the island that would welcome everyone who wanted to hear the story behind Lady Liberty. Going beyond the vague and often dubious ideal of American ""liberty,"" the museum's displays highlight the doubts of black Americans and women who saw their personal liberties compromised on a daily basis in the 1880s, when the statue opened. These exhibits also spotlight a bit of history that is often forgotten: that the French creators intended the statue as a commemoration of the abolition of slavery in the United States. (Julia Jacobs) statueoflibertymuseum.org 'STONEWALL 50 AT THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY' (through Dec. 1). For its Stonewall summer, the society offers a bouquet of three micro-shows: ""Letting Loose and Fighting Back: L.G.B.T.Q. Nightlife Before and After Stonewall,"" which closes on Sept. 22, is devoted the night life that thrived in places such as the 1950s lesbian bar called the Sea Colony and the gay male sex clubs like the Anvil and the Ramrod that sizzled in the 1970s. ""By the Force of Our Presence: Highlights From the Lesbian Herstory Archives"" documents the founding in 1974 -- by Joan Nestle, Deborah Edel, Sahli Cavallero, Pamela Olin and Julia Stanley -- of a compendious and still-growing register of lesbian culture. And ""Say It Loud, Out and Proud: Fifty Years of Pride"" turns a solo spotlight on charismatic individuals: Storme DeLarverie (1920-2014), Mother Flawless Sabrina/Jack Doroshow (1939-2017), Keith Haring (1958-90) and Rollerena Fairy Godmother.

212-873-3400, nyhistory.org 'T. REX: THE ULTIMATE PREDATOR' at the American Museum of Natural History (through Aug. 9). Everyone's favorite 18,000-pound prehistoric killer gets the star treatment in this eye-opening exhibition, which presents the latest scientific research on T. rex and also introduces many other tyrannosaurs, some discovered only this century in China and Mongolia. T. rex evolved mainly during the Cretaceous period to have keen eyes, spindly arms and massive conical teeth, which packed a punch that has never been matched by any other creature; the dinosaur could even swallow whole bones, as affirmed here by a kid-friendly display of fossilized excrement. The show mixes 66-million-year-old teeth with the latest 3-D prints of dino bones, and also presents new models of T. rex as a baby, a juvenile and a full-grown annihilator. Turns out this most savage beast was covered with -- believe it! -- a soft coat of beige or white feathers. (Farago)

'2019 WHITNEY BIENNIAL' at the Whitney Museum of American Art (through Sept. 22). Given the political tensions that have sent spasms through the nation over the past two years, you might have expected -- hoped -- that this year's biennial would be one big, sharp Occupy-style yawp. It isn't. Politics are present but, with a few notable exceptions, murmured, coded, stitched into the weave of fastidiously form-conscious, labor-intensive work. As a result, the exhibition, organized by two young Whitney curators, Rujeko Hockley and Jane Panetta, gives the initial impression of being a well-groomed group show rather than a statement of resistance. But once you start looking closely, the impression changes artist by artist, piece by piece -- there's quiet agitation in the air. (Cotter) 

212-570-3600, whitney.org 'VIOLET HOLDINGS: LGBTQ+ HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE N.Y.U. SPECIAL COLLECTIONS' at Bobst Library (through Dec. 31). With the Stonewall Inn now a National Historic Landmark (and a bar again; it was a bagel shop in the 1980s), nearby New York University has produced a homegrown archival exhibition at Bobst Library, across the park from Grey Art Gallery. Organized by Hugh Ryan, it takes the local history of queer identity back to the 19th century with documents on Elizabeth Robins (1862-1952), an American actor, suffragist and friend of Virginia Woolf, and forward with ephemera related to the musician and drag king Johnny Science (1955-2007) and the African-American D.J. Larry Levan (1954-92), who, in the 1980s, presided, godlike, at a gay disco called the Paradise Garage, which was a short walk from the campus. (Cotter) 

212-998-2500, library.nyu.edu 'CAMP: NOTES ON FASHION' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Sept. 8). Inspired by Susan Sontag's 1964 essay, ""Notes on 'Camp,'"" the latest spectacular from the Met's Costume Institute attempts to define this elastic, constantly evolving concept, which leaves taste, seriousness and heteronormativity in the dust. The show researches camp's emergence in 18th-century France and 19th-century England, examines ""Sontagian Camp"" and culminates in an immense gallery of designer confectionaries from the 1980s to now that calls to mind a big, shiny Christmas tree barricaded with presents.

212-535-7100, metmuseum.org 'T.C. CANNON: AT THE EDGE OF AMERICA' at the National Museum of the American Indian (through Sept. 16). In 31 years, Cannon made more stunning artworks than some artists make in much longer lifetimes. This retrospective brings together his polychromatic paintings of Native Americans, intimate drawings commenting on the country's violent history, and original poetry, folk songs and letters to emphasize the full breadth of his singularly hybrid vision. That he made so much mature work in so many mediums before dying in a car accident in 1978 is all the more remarkable. In Cannon's most powerful works, he brings Modernist styles -- most notably Post-Impressionism and Fauvism -- to bear on portraits of Native Americans. There are echoes of Matisse in his ambush of colors and patterns, and shades of van Gogh in his animation of the landscape. But paintings like ""Two Guns Arikara"" (1974-77) and ""Indian With Beaded Headdress"" (1978) demonstrate his irrefutable originality. (Jillian Steinhauer) 

americanindian.si.edu 'LEONARD COHEN: A CRACK IN EVERYTHING' at the Jewish Museum (through Sept. 8). The curators of this show, John Zeppetelli of the Musee d'Art Contemporain de Montreal and Victor Shiffman, commissioned artists of various disciplines to develop pieces inspired by Cohen. Some are simple and quiet, like ""Ear on a Worm"" from the film artist Tacita Dean, a small image playing on a loop high in a space that shows a perched bird, a reference to ""Bird on the Wire"" from Cohen's 1969 album ""Songs From a Room."" Some are closer to traditional documentary, like George Fok's ""Passing Through,"" which intercuts performances by Cohen throughout his career with video that surrounds the viewer, suggesting the songs are constant and eternal while the performer's body changes with time. Taken together, the layered work on display has a lot to offer on Cohen, but even more to say about how we respond to music, bring it into our lives, and use it as both a balm and an agent for transformation.

With a new David Adjaye-designed headquarters under construction on West 125th Street, the museum is distributing its exhibitions among various locations around town. Its annual artists-in-residence show, which is known for being a reputation clincher, has found a berth at MoMA PS1 in Long Island City, Queens. This year's three participants -- Allison Janae Hamilton, Tschabalala Self and Sable Elyse Smith -- are arguably already en route to stardom. It's also worth noting that, strategically and tonally, this year's edition, with its formally experimental, slow-release explorations into the politics of African-American life, is very much of a piece with the excellent, and overlapping, 2019 Whitney Biennial.

Real Estate,The Last Piece of a Far West Side Project Gets Built,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/16/realestate/waterline-square-far-west-side-59th-street.html,"A rendering of Three Waterline Square, a tower designed by Rafael Vinoly. The area has been in development since high-rises were proposed in the mid-1970s by Donald J. Trump.

The Last Piece of a Far West Side Project Gets Built

The effort to convert the old Penn Central rail yard on the Far West Side of Manhattan into high-rises has bumped along since being proposed in the mid-1970s by a developer named Donald J. Trump. What was proposed for the area often rankled neighbors, who found the buildings to be too tall, too close together and too pricey. But, after welcoming its first residents in the late 1990s, the controversial mega-project is entering its homestretch. Construction is underway at the site's three final apartment towers, which are rising from a nearly five-acre site from West 59th to West 61st Streets, and Riverside Boulevard to Freedom Place South. Called Waterline Square for its proximity to the Hudson River, the 1,132-unit mixed-use condo and rental development is from GID Development Group, the last in a line of developers to control the property.

With designs from architects like Richard Meier and amenities that include an indoor tennis court, plus restaurants and a new public park, Waterline Square could quell lingering doubts about the area's being a perpetual work in progress. ""When they first started building here, no one believed in it,"" said Gilad Azaria, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate who has lived for 12 years on Riverside Boulevard, the neighborhood's main drag, and who frequently sells in the area.

Waterline Square, which broke ground in 2015 and will open to residents in 2018, ""will make the area more of a neighborhood,"" said Mr. Azaria, who isn't involved with the project. Stylistically, the $2.3 billion project is a departure from the past. Its towers are angular and glassy, unlike the boxier brick-and-stone versions in the area whose names through the decades have included Lincoln West and Riverside South.

A partnership that included Mr. Trump developed most of those earlier buildings, and even though that group is no longer the landlord, Mr. Trump's name still appears on facades there. At Waterline, three major firms designed the exteriors of the towers, Richard Meier and Partners Architects, Rafael Vinoly Architects and Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates; each firm was responsible for a different address. But a detailed master plan imposed by the city in 2010 largely determined the buildings' crystalline shapes, according to GID. Still, GID officials seem grateful that their product will stand out on a somewhat homogeneous strip. ""We wanted to break the mold of what came before,"" said James Linsley, the president of GID, which also owns the nearby Aldyn, a rental and condo complex, and the Ashley, a rental tower. Mr. Vinoly went even further, describing the first buildings in the area as ""the blandest thing in the world."" But, with the final piece falling into place, he said, ""it's certainly going to be more interesting."" Each Waterline tower stacks condos atop rentals. One Waterline Square, a 37-story tower, offers 56 condos atop 216 rentals, while Two Waterline Square, a 38-story building, has 160 condos and 486 rentals. And Three Waterline Square has 34 stories, with 47 condos above 167 rentals. In each building, the condo and rental sections have separate entrances. Twenty percent of the project, or 226 units, has been set aside as affordable housing. Condo buyers, meanwhile, will pay reduced taxes for 20 years because Waterline Square qualified for a 421a abatement.

Condo interiors will feature counters made of veined marble and Gaggenau appliances. The rental units will have ""different finishes but a similar level of quality,"" Mr. Linsley said. Inside will be about 118,000 square feet of amenities, with about 90,000 square feet spread out in a three-level below-grade space called the Waterline Club that will have a swimming pool, a two-lane bowling alley, a recording studio, a full-size basketball court and a tennis court. Renters will pay a fee for access. Lounges, catering kitchens and libraries will be scattered throughout the towers, too. Outside, threaded among the apartment buildings, will be a 2.6-acre public park. In addition, each tower will have retail spaces that restaurants are expected to lease, according to GID. The surroundings are getting a makeover, too. Ultimately, Riverside Boulevard will be extended to West 59th Street, opening flow in a walled-off corner. A city project to extend Riverside Park southward is also underway. Sales at Waterline Square, where one-bedrooms start at around $2 million and prices average about $2,900 a square foot, began earlier this month through Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group. Leasing, which will be handled by GID, won't start till 2018. In contrast, the average price of new apartments in Lincoln Square, the name of the broader area, is about $2,400 a square foot, according to StreetEasy.com.","The riverfront area around West 59th Street has been a work in progress for decades, but the final three apartment towers are now under construction.",160b6788-3705-51a7-9ae6-2325a7ab7816,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/18/realestate/18HIGHEND2/18HIGHEND2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=f3b5197771e1e8a8d61621a481a2c12f02834cd3f0d85f20261b445988c08712&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A rendering of Three Waterline Square, a tower designed by Rafael Viñoly.

The sparrows click their bills against a hard surface while singing. That clicking is done in coordination with the song, much as a percussion instrument accompanies a melody. Researchers at Hokkaido University in Japan observed the birds producing clicks frequently toward the beginning of their songs and around specific notes. Birds that were related produced similar percussive patterns, but whether this behavior is learned or innate is unclear.","The bird clicks its bill against a hard surface while it sings, much as a percussion instrument accompanies a melody.",06b0d22d-9b08-5c22-b67a-82c5c0f9e139,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/20/science/20Sparrow/20Sparrow-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=218&w=416&s=6cb6883e4d9332e22d485df7e94ed866e4574f0e0e35c15c743ca1695ac86d90&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A still image from a video of Java sparrows performing a courtship display.,06b0d22d-9b08-5c22-b67a-82c5c0f9e139,N24News/imgs/06b0d22d-9b08-5c22-b67a-82c5c0f9e139.jpg,2
Opinion,Is There a Wizard Behind the Curtain?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-trump-biden-sanders.html,"Bret Stephens: We're in a new and frightening world, Gail. Every time I get a news alert on my phone, I hear James Earl Jones's voice in my head, saying, ""Mother of God."" And every time I listen to Donald Trump's voice, I hear Slim Pickens's voice from ""Dr. Strangelove."" How are you riding out the crisis? Gail Collins: I'm trying to look upon this as a social experiment on what happens if you require the whole country to stay at home and then deprive them of all sports programming. While you were reading Camus, my husband and I went to our favorite restaurant for what I guess will be the last meal out for a long time. No need to worry about keeping adequate space between diners -- there was hardly anybody there. Just a lot of staff worrying about their next paycheck. Bret: The economic consequences are going to be devastating for people who are already living paycheck to paycheck, to say nothing of tip to tip. I don't fear a recession. I fear a full-scale depression. It is hard to overstate how bad this could get if it goes on for months. Andrew Yang's suggestion of a universal basic income is suddenly looking extremely smart and potentially essential.

Gail: And Sunday night we watched the Biden-Sanders debate. Never thought I'd regard an argument between two elderly politicians as entertainment, but any distraction is welcome. What was your take? Bret: I watched the first 90 minutes, concluded that Bernie had laid no mortal blows and that Biden could still hold his own. Joe's line that ""people are looking for results, not revolution"" seemed to nicely capture his core message. And his insistence that we need to deal with the emergency before us, rather than tear down and reinvent the system, seems particularly relevant now. Gail: And Biden promised a female vice-presidential nominee. Something we all figured he'd do, but the sudden commitment seemed to take Bernie off guard.
* Mark Penn and Andrew Stein write that ""only a broader course correction to the center will give Democrats a fighting chance in 2022"" and beyond.
* Tory Gavito and Adam Jentleson write that the Virgina loss should ""shock Democrats into confronting the powerful role that racially coded attacks play in American politics.""
* Ezra Klein speaks to David Shor, who discusses his fear that Democrats face electoral catastrophe unless they shift their messaging.
* Ross Douthat writes that the outcome of the Virginia gubernatorial race shows Democrats need a ""new way to talk about progressive ideology and education."" Bret: Among the thousand-and-one surprises of this astonishing primary season is that Democrats are acting like Republicans used to -- rallying around the original presumptive front-runner. Now do you think he can go the distance and beat Trump? Gail: Lord, I hope so, Bret. But trying to imagine what the country will be like in the fall is sort of like leaping into science fiction. If the virus threat drops off reasonably soon and the country struggles back to normal, maybe Trump will find some way of taking credit for it.

Bret: If it turns out we have a low case-fatality rate -- and, by the way, I'm amazed by all the new terminology I'm learning on account of this pandemic, including ""social distancing"" and ""shelf-stable ingredient"" -- then Trump will call the coronavirus an even bigger liberal hoax than his impeachment was, never mind that he's the guy who declared a national emergency. Either that, or he'll say that he, alone, stopped it. Gail: Although in the real world I think we can agree he's been a disaster. Bret: As Obama said in a different context: Yes. We. Can. Gail: There was the speech from the Oval Office where he got everything wrong, and then the news conference where he shook about 50 hands and then spent much of the rest of his time introducing captains of industry he claimed were being the heroes of the hour. Bret: Including more false claims about Google. You know that Pinocchio tracker that our friends at The Washington Post use? I think the nose grew so long keeping track of Trump's falsehoods last week that it hit the ground. Gail: And for the Democrats, right now it's sure looking like Biden. But we have learned not to take the future for granted, haven't we? Bret: Well, exactly. The three likeliest people to be elected (or re-elected) president in November are all far more vulnerable to the diseases caused by the coronavirus than younger Americans. Is that why Tulsi Gabbard won't quit? I'm still not counting Sanders out completely given how fluid things are, but I find the thought of Biden as the presumptive nominee immensely reassuring. I also think he should name his running mate sooner rather than later. How do you like the sound of ""Biden-Klobuchar""?

Gail: Well, I know you like the sound. And it's fine by me. I've passed the point of pickiness. Right now my standards are rock bottom. Don't even care if the next president reforms the tax system as long as he knows how to handle a pandemic. Bret: I'll be sure to pass this tidbit along to Mitch McConnell. To adapt another Obama-era line, never let a pandemic go to waste! Gail: So, tell me what's happening in your house? Besides reading ""The Plague,"" what's everybody doing to pass the time? Bret: The change has been as sudden as it is stunning. Manhattan feels ghostly. All of my usual routines -- going to the gym; dining out; going to a concert -- are out. So is all travel for business or pleasure, foreign and domestic. We've decided to buy a car (we're a low-carbon footprint family) partly on the theory that we will be doing a lot of nature walks in the Catskills pretty soon. The kids are home from school and it isn't at all clear when they'll be back in a classroom; we are going to have to figure out distance learning for them -- which puts me in mind of suggesting to Apple and every other laptop maker in the United States to offer to make a computer available for free to every American child who needs one. Bret: I worry mostly about my elderly relatives and friends, and the price they are already paying in isolation and fear. On the other hand, if there's a silver lining in any of this it's that it is forcing me to slow down for the first time in years and take stock of what matters most in life. How about you? Gail: Today we got our Amazon shipment that includes a Monopoly game. If all else fails my husband and I will spend this evening trying to bankrupt one another.

Bret: So you can know how it feels to be Donald Trump! Gail: At night, when we're missing the late-night comedians, we've been killing time watching episodes from the original ""Star Trek."" Just got to one that involves an ambitious woman who desperately wants to command a starship. But in the 1960s version of the 23rd century, women can't do that. So she uses a machine that switches her consciousness into Captain Kirk's body. The crew quickly figures out something is wrong when their leader begins filing his nails and bursts into hysterics at the least little thing. I know that doesn't have much bearing on the coronavirus, but it is nice, once in a while, to contemplate the fact that I've seen some amazing social changes in my life. For the good. The news wasn't always terrible. We've just got to work together and ignore the crazy people. One of whom, alas, happens to be the president of the United States. Bret, we'll keep talking about how your kids -- and everyone else's kids -- are being affected by all this. When I was growing up, we were constantly being assured by the government that Russia wanted to blow us up (duck and cover!) and in our Catholic schools the nuns were warning that God might be preparing us for the end of the world. You'd figure all that would make us timid about taking chances, but in fact it made a lot of us wildly distrustful of authority, with interesting consequences for the world.

Food,"In Brooklyn, a Chance to Enjoy Factory-Fresh Ice Cream",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/28/dining/ice-cream-factories-brooklyn.html,"When the Brooklyn-based Ample Hills Creamery opens a 15,000-square-foot factory in Red Hook next month, its owners, Brian Smith and Jackie Cuscuna, will be able to churn a million gallons of ice cream a year to keep up with their shops and pint production. The offbeat, candy-packed ice creams will get a tweak in texture, becoming creamier and smoother.

Best of all, fans will get a chance to sample them at the source in October, when a scoop shop opens, with windows offering a clear view into the plant. By next spring, Mr. Smith said, visitors will be able to go on self-guided tours of the factory, and walk through various ice cream-themed installations.

Ample Hills, which opened its first shop is 2011, currently makes its ice cream in Gowanus, using a batch-freezing method. But the new dairy plant, beside Erie Basin, will use a continuous freezing method: Milk will run steadily through a gleaming network of tanks and pipes -- pasteurized, pumped through homogenizers and swirled through a hopper with flavorings -- before it is uniformly aerated and frozen in the tireless spin of industrial dasher blades.",Ample Hills and OddFellows are opening plants where fans can sample the wares and see how the good stuff is made.,173e38f3-984b-50d4-9f2f-5b7576d668a8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/30/dining/30Ample/30Ample-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=275c08eb4ff91733c3a7b394b3478895a12946d2b85e9d02dc500b476260ce54&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Jackie Cuscuna and Brian Smith at their new factory in Red Hook.,173e38f3-984b-50d4-9f2f-5b7576d668a8,N24News/imgs/173e38f3-984b-50d4-9f2f-5b7576d668a8.jpg,17

Media,U.S. Open Draws Crowds to Times Square With Promise of Mega-Selfies,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/26/business/media/us-open-times-square-billboard-selfie.html,"Have you ever wondered how it's possible to command more than a few seconds of someone's time in the packed madhouse that is Times Square, a.k.a. the ""Crossroads of the World"" and the unofficial sensory overload capital of America?

As it turns out, the answer is easy: Lure the curious with the promise of a mega-selfie.

To promote the United States Open, which begins in Flushing, N.Y., on Monday, the United States Tennis Association offered visitors the opportunity to have pictures of themselves posted on six billboards throughout Times Square.

For two hours on Thursday, throngs of tourists and even a few locals took it up on the offer, lingering on a spot of concrete near 43rd Street and Broadway and whirling around to take a selfie with their own giant images displayed high above. Very meta.

Nicole Kankam, the managing director of marketing for the tennis association, said the digital takeover was an attempt to attract a new type of tennis fan: someone who is younger, who is more digitally savvy and, crucially, who might buy a ticket and help fill the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. (Thanks to renovations, the center will be able to host an additional 100,000 fans by 2018.)",The United States Tennis Association lured tourists and locals to Times Square for a digital takeover to promote the U.S. Open.,6a81bbdf-e077-5e22-aacd-cf3ebacf87f2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/26/nyregion/26xp-takeover/26xp-takeover-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=6bbf55bd50e97dea0706a258b51a6660a87863d51721bc770db331f1e1aa4c5c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Lucas Morissette, a tourist visiting from Vancouver, took a mega-selfie in Times Square on Thursday.",6a81bbdf-e077-5e22-aacd-cf3ebacf87f2,N24News/imgs/6a81bbdf-e077-5e22-aacd-cf3ebacf87f2.jpg,16
Movies,Why Is Hollywood So Scared of Climate Change?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/movies/hollywood-climate-change.html,"Humans ruined everything. They bred too much and choked the life out of the land, air and sea. And so they must be vaporized by half, or attacked by towering monsters, or vanquished by irate dwellers from the oceans' polluted depths. Barring that, they face hardscrabble, desperate lives on a once verdant Earth now consumed by ice or drought. That is how many recent superhero and sci-fi movies -- among them the latest Avengers and Godzilla pictures as well as ""Aquaman,"" ""Snowpiercer,"" ""Blade Runner 2049,"" ""Interstellar"" and ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" -- have invoked the climate crisis. They imagine postapocalyptic futures or dystopias where ecological collapse is inevitable, environmentalists are criminals, and eco-mindedness is the driving force of villains. But these takes are defeatist, critics say, and a growing chorus of voices is urging the entertainment industry to tell more stories that show humans adapting and reforming to ward off the worst climate threats. ""More than ever, they're missing the mark, often in the same way ,"" said Michael Svoboda, a writing professor at George Washington University and author at the multimedia site Yale Climate Connections. ""Almost none of these films depict a successful transformation of society.""

In ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" the archnemesis, Thanos, opts to head off environmental collapse by reducing humanity -- along with all living beings -- by half. In ""Godzilla: King of the Monsters,"" eco-terrorists unleash predatory beasts to forestall mass extinction and keep the human population in check. In ""Aquaman,"" King Orm, the leader of an undersea kingdom, concludes that the only way to prevent earthly destruction is to wage war on humans. David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, one of the writers of ""Aquaman,"" said using pollution as a motivator made Orm more relatable and less ""mustache-twirly,"" and added, ""It gave him some nuance."" But Svoboda sees Orm as part of a trend that moves the climate crisis into emotionally familiar and comfortable territory. The villain is defeated and the audience feels relief, he said, not least because they have been let off the hook: People may be doing real harm, but the alternatives are worse. The trend of linking environmentalism to eco-terrorism is not confined to superhero and genre flicks, Svoboda said. In the 2017 indie ""First Reformed,"" Ethan Hawke plays a radicalized pastor who plots to blow himself up at a church service attended by a polluting industrialist.

In a contrarian piece for The Washington Post, the film journalist Sonny Bunch said as much himself, opining that environmentalists made for ideal bad guys because they want to make our lives worse by banning straws, large families, plane travel and red meat. More sober takes on the subject, at least on the silver screen, have largely been confined to documentaries, which, with the exception of the 2006 Al Gore hit, ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" audiences and buyers mostly shunned. (On the small screen, docuseries and other shows often address the issue, but rarely break through in this age of peak TV.) O ne big studio feature that tackled climate change, ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" in which subzero superstorms envelop half the globe, was released 15 years ago. More recent efforts have foundered, like Alexander Payne's ""Downsizing"" (2017), which imagined humans shrinking to the size of chipmunks to reduce their carbon footprint while still living large. Svoboda pointed to ""Young Ones,"" a 2014 film starring Michael Shannon as a father eking out an existence in a drought ravaged world, as the rare film that showed humans adapting to global warming, but it barely made a blip. The actor and director Fisher Stevens, who has made several documentaries about environmental issues, including two with Leonardo DiCaprio, said he found it deeply frustrating that Hollywood had not taken Big Oil to task onscreen in a significant way. ""We need a pop culture 'Forrest Gump' movie now to wake people up,"" Stevens said, ""because the fossil fuel industry is doing everything to stop us in America from believing that fossil fuels are causing climate change.""

(DiCaprio, a committed environmentalist who has a foundation that tackles climate change, did not respond to a request for comment). So why aren't there more realistic, or semi-realistic, or, dare it be suggested, hopeful films about climate change? Because, several directors said, it is hard to find financing for movies that risk being real downers and challenge audiences to change their ways. Because mass extinction is soul-crushing and people seek out entertainment to escape. Because, said Roland Emmerich, the writer and director of ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" it is not easy to find a story that franchise-addicted studios will release. ""We don't do a good job,"" he said, ""And I'm constantly trying to figure out what could be another way to show it.""

""Is any of this enough? No way,"" McKay wrote in an email. ""It seems like there's no such things as 'enough' with global warming."" On both sides of the Atlantic, there are efforts to change that and to infuse narratives with hope. Along with detailing how projects can reduce their carbon footprint during production, the Producers Guild of America, and, more emphatically, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, are showing content creators how to incorporate green themes into their films and shows. On the Producers Guild's Green Production Guide site, a report by the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit that promotes sustainability, lays out ways renewables can be portrayed onscreen. Some suggested plotlines come with a wink, ranging from showing characters who go off the grid to philanderers who fall for their solar-panel installers. The point, said Jacob Corvidae, one of the report's authors, is to relay how robust the clean energy sector is, and also to sow hope. ""We do need depictions that things could be O.K. because people worked at it,"" he said. This spring, BAFTA released a study showing how many times ecological terms appeared on British television in one year (the report did not include film). ""Climate change,"" for example, appeared more than ""zombie"" but trailed ""gravy,"" and was utterly trounced by ""queen"" and ""tea."" The academy also started an initiative, Planet Placement, exhorting film and television content creators to help ""make positive environmental behaviors mainstream."" With screen industries' massive reach, they said, ""it's a chance to shape society's response to climate change."" ""The past 25 years of the environmental narrative is about sacrifice and doom and not doing what you want and not getting what you want,"" said Aaron Matthews, head of industry sustainability at BAFTA. ""We don't think that's the right tone to get people over the line.""",Environmental concerns have been the driving force of villains in recent superhero and sci-fi movies. But critics say the industry needs to show how society can reform its ways.,ee43d858-6414-502c-957a-d7dbbdbef92b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/15/arts/15eco-films1/merlin_137259609_e9a8c352-a709-4ac9-994b-0f6a244d2c0a-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=2443cf79cf64ba294f8ece0f66159e67dc15ef17894b4f2b849a91d0620fed44&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Thanos (Josh Brolin) destroys half of the universe because intelligent species are consuming too many resources in ""Avengers: Infinity War.""",ee43d858-6414-502c-957a-d7dbbdbef92b,N24News/imgs/ee43d858-6414-502c-957a-d7dbbdbef92b.jpg,5
Science,Imagining the Moon,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/science/moon-art-culture.html,"[Read all Times reporting on the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. | Sign up for the weekly Science Times email.] We've never been closer to the moon. Even though humans have not been there for decades, our understanding of our lunar neighbor has never been better. But our ability to really know our moon was not always this easy. The beginning of the moon race in 1959 offered our first real glimpses of the surface, with Soviet probes sending the first close-up pictures back to Earth. We inched closer with the Apollo 8 flyby in 1968. No humans had ever been so near. For the first time, our view was swapped -- it was the pockmarked lunar surface in the foreground, and our blue speckled Earth in the distance.

[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] For millenniums the moon was a thing of legend. People believed that it controlled our moods, our behaviors and even our destinies. This divine assignment found its way into myths, literature and, of course, art. ""Both before and after the invention of the telescope, artists and amateur astronomers were looking at the moon, interpreting what they saw, and trying to reconcile this with religious and philosophical beliefs at the time,"" says David Bardeen, an art historian at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""Art helped negotiate all of the questions that were being raised.""

One of the oldest portrayals of the moon was made at the height of the Bronze Age. The two-dimensional sculpture, forged from metal and gold, is called the Nebra Sky Disk because of where it was discovered in Germany. It dates to 1600 B.C. and is one of the oldest known depictions of the cosmos. Art historians believe it was probably an astronomical tool, hinting at how some Bronze Age cultures kept watch on the sky.

To the East and many centuries later, the crescent moon appeared in a sculpture called the Stele of Nabonidus. In ancient Babylon, King Nabonidus worshiped the moon god, called Sin, represented as the crescent moon. The king even gestures upward as a mark of his devotion. This piece dates to the sixth century B.C., during the last neo-Babylonian era, when religious worship of the moon was common. Many older pieces, like this stele, connect the moon to a deity. But as technology developed, our relationship to the moon began to change. In fall 1609, Galileo Galilei used his new telescope to look at the moon from the hills of Tuscany. The object he had before seen only with his eyes suddenly became more complex. Originally trained as an artist, he grabbed watercolors and his notebook and painted the surface of the moon over a few months, documenting how the shadows changed and the light collected in craters of different sizes. Soon after, he published these drawings in a journal called ""Sidereus Nuncius"" with support of the Medici family in Florence. This astronomical treatise was then widely distributed, making visual access to the moon's surface available to some for the first time in history. Suddenly, in Galileo's watercolors, the austere lunar facade was filled with valleys and craters, making Earth and the moon more similar than previously imagined.

Although Galileo revealed that the moon was not merely a smooth, featureless orb, artists continued finding symbolic meanings in our lunar neighbor. ""Artists use the moon symbolically, but the ways in which they paint it often bear little relationship to scientific discoveries,"" Caroline Campbell, director of research at the National Gallery in London, said. ""The moon is a very powerful way of showing the 'other.' Something alien and different."" Nearly three centuries after Galileo, a Japanese woodblock artist, Taiso Yoshitoshi, created a series of prints called ""One Hundred Aspects of the Moon."" At a time when Western influence was high, Yoshitoshi made a concerted effort to bring Japanese and Chinese lunar myths back into popular art. One of his most famous pieces, ""Cassia Tree Moon (Tsuki no Katsura),"" depicts Wu Gang of the Han dynasty, who abused his power after becoming fluent in Taoist magic. As punishment he is sentenced for eternity to chop down the cassia trees that grow on the moon. Once removed with his giant ax, they would immediately grow back. The full transition of the moon in the Western imagination -- from light source, to a symbol, into simply an object of nature to be documented -- may have been completed in the 19th century with what is perhaps the most famous depiction of the night sky. In 1889, Vincent van Gogh admired the moon through his bedroom window at the asylum at St.-Remy-de-Provence. ""Starry Night"" is almost an overwhelming dance of brush strokes, like starlight that has been smeared and animated. But as if it were the only static object in the night sky, the crescent moon rests in the upper right of the painting. While wholly unrealistic, van Gogh's impression of the natural world manages to not only invoke a real sense of what the night sky looked like, but also how it felt to see it. This is one of the first major works of art that provides us with a sense of the night without relying on myth or religious symbols. Earlier in the same century, the moon started to be an object for the imagination to explore.","The moon in art has changed from symbol to something real, but that hasn't changed our will to see it.",a8b69486-dcec-5fae-a0f9-6e8c293db6d0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/14/science/00MOON-ART8/00MOON-ART8-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=eb64fa0c5c60e122c784c2eb15cb7ed9153dd239a3ee076fff2a65c4a363a881&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""Voyage dans La Lune,"" a 1902 film by Georges Méliès.",a8b69486-dcec-5fae-a0f9-6e8c293db6d0,N24News/imgs/a8b69486-dcec-5fae-a0f9-6e8c293db6d0.jpg,2

Dance,Executive Realness: 3 'Pose' Stars on Dancing and Being Seen,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/17/arts/dance/pose-dancing-ryan-murphy-fx.html,"Ryan Jamaal Swain, Dominique Jackson and Jason A. Rodriguez talk about their experiences as dancers in life -- and onscreen in Ryan Murphy's show about the underground ballroom scene of the 1980s.

""How am I supposed to learn how to do all that?"" asks Damon, an aspiring dancer played by Ryan Jamaal Swain, on the pilot of the FX series ""Pose."" It's nighttime on a Greenwich Village pier, and Damon is discovering what it means to vogue. To music blasting from a boombox, dancers face off with strutting, swiveling moves, their limbs snapping into bold, hieroglyphic shapes. Recently kicked out of his childhood home for being gay, Damon has just moved to New York and found a new, more nurturing mother in Blanca (Mj Rodriguez). Vogueing, she explains to him, is a way of being seen and known: ""It's a statement: 'I want a name in this world. I want to be on top.'""

The show's most exuberant moments take place at balls, where members of houses, or chosen families, dress up and walk (compete) for trophies in categories like Royalty, Military and Executive Realness. To be real is to pass for a member of the wealthy, white, heterosexual society from which contestants are excluded -- to look as if they could walk right in. It's this subculture that gave rise to vogueing, a now thoroughly popularized and globally practiced dance form. Drawing its early inspiration from fashion models -- and its name from the magazine -- the style emerged as a kind of pantomimic combat performed at balls. As the vogueing pioneer Willi Ninja, the founder of the House of Ninja, says in ""Paris Is Burning,"" ""Vogueing is like a safe form of throwing shade."" ""Pose"" has been heralded for its largely L.G.B.T. cast, crew and creative team, which includes five transgender actors in central roles. Also to be celebrated: the number of actors and dancers from the current ballroom scene. Danielle Polanco, who choreographed the ball and pier segments with Leiomy Maldonado (also known as the Wonder Woman of Vogue), said they made a point of hiring dancers acquainted with that world. ""All we need is real, authentic ballroom -- generic doesn't fit with this show,"" said Ms. Polanco, formerly a mother of the House of Ninja. ""We need people who really respect the culture, because if you don't respect it, you can't play it, you know?"" To remain true to the period, she said, she turned to ballroom veterans like Hector Xtravaganza, Freddie Pendavis and Sol Williams, who were on set as consultants.

Mr. Swain is not a ballroom native, but that's authentic, too. While rehearsing with Ms. Polanco for the scene in which Damon walks his first ball, he was, like his character, brand-new to vogueing. During that high-stakes scene, the upstart House of Evangelista goes head-to-head with its nemesis, the House of Abundance, led by the ultraglamorous Elektra Abundance (Dominique Jackson). Holding his own on the dance floor, Damon battles Lemar Abundance (Jason A. Rodriguez), a quiet character who is rarely front-and-center, but, when the time comes to vogue, steals the show. Behind these characters is a wealth of experience dancing -- or refraining from dancing -- that informed their roles on ""Pose."" Mr. Swain, Ms. Jackson and Mr. Rodriguez spoke in telephone interviews about dancing in life and onscreen.

Though new to vogueing, Mr. Swain was not a dance rookie when he arrived on the set of ""Pose."" Growing up in Birmingham, Ala., and attending Howard University, he studied tap, ballet, modern and Afro-Cuban dance. As a child, he said, he reluctantly devoted more time to sports than to dance class. ""In the South, for African-American males, unfortunately the stereotype is that you play sports,"" he said. Upon moving to New York with a musical theater degree, Mr. Swain, 24, tried to focus on acting. ""Dance is such a very vulnerable way of expressing myself,"" he said. ""I was trying to hide and run away from it."" But he wound up serving as the dance captain for his first Off Broadway show. And then, to his surprise, he landed the role of Damon. ""In some way, shape or form, dance always found me,"" he said.

In ""Pose,"" Damon finds himself pulled between two dance worlds. After joining the House of Evangelista, he successfully auditions -- with a heart-on-sleeve routine to Whitney Houston -- for the prestigious New School of Dance (a fictionalized Ailey School). At first his teacher praises him: ""You weren't rehearsing today. No -- you were dancing,"" she says, rewarding him with a ticket to the ballet. But when a ball rehearsal makes him late for class, she disapproves: Ballroom, she insinuates, is not for serious dancers. Mr. Swain agreed that Damon's evolution as a dancer paralleled his own, especially when it comes to conquering insecurities. For Damon, a new chapter of self-assurance might be in store. ""By the eighth episode,"" Mr. Swain said, ""you see him breaking out.""

The magisterial Elektra rarely vogues, excelling instead in fashion-focused categories like Dynasty and Femme Queen in Pumps. She achieves realness at any cost. In Episode 1, her house dazzles in the Royalty category, thanks to costumes purloined from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Ms. Jackson, 43, knows this world intimately. Born in Tobago (she moved to Maryland as a teenager), she found her way to ballroom in the early '90s. For transgender women like her, she said, vogueing was less common than it is today because it built muscle -- a mark of masculinity. Though she had taken dance classes in Tobago and performed with her high school dance squad, she tended not to vogue at balls, sticking to what are known as face and runway categories.

""If you did anything that created muscles, then they didn't consider you one of the elite women,"" she said. ""But times have changed."" (An embodiment of that change: Ms. Maldonado, whose dramatic, hair-whipping style has transformed the vogueing landscape.) Still, Ms. Jackson credits her early dance training with teaching her balance, poise and musicality. ""It is dance that actually helped me master the runway,"" she said. And she happily owns it as part of her identity. ""I'm claiming it,"" she said. ""I am a dancer.""","Ryan Jamaal Swain, Dominique Jackson and Jason A.

Art & Design,Alley Oop Will Return (Spoiler Alert),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/arts/design/alley-oop-comic-strip.html,"The comic strip ""Alley Oop,"" starring a loin-cloth-wearing cave man of the same name, went into hibernation in September but will be back in January.

A new creative team, the writer Joey Alison Sayers and the artist Jonathan Lemon, will chronicle the exploits of the title hero six days a week, Monday through Saturday. On Sundays, they will tell the story of Li'L Oop, a new preteen version of Alley Oop that will focus on his early middle-school years.

Sayers said she hoped to add more humor to the strip, which has created by V.T. Hamlin and focused on Alley Oop and his life in the prehistoric kingdom of Moo since its debut in 1932. In 1939, it introduced Dr. Elbert Wonmug, a 20th-century scientist who sent the cave man on time-travel adventures. ""I want to make it a little zanier and just have a little more fun and draw readers in,"" Sayers said. The Sunday installments, she said, would likely not involve time travel.

Sports,"Alex Olmedo, 84, Dies; Tennis Star Known for a Remarkable Year",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/sports/tennis/alex-olmedo-dead.html,"Alex Olmedo, the Peruvian who dominated the world of international tennis in 1959 when he won the Australian and Wimbledon men's single championships and reached the final of the United States Nationals at Forest Hills, died on Wednesday in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 84. The International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I., said the cause was brain cancer. Olmedo was inducted into the hall in 1987. Olmedo took his first steps toward tennis acclaim at the club in Arequipa, Peru, where his father, Salvador, who oversaw the courts, gave him pointers. He was also guided by Stanley Singer, an American tennis coach working in Peru. He made his major championship debut in 1951 when he was 15, losing in a preliminary round at Forest Hills. After settling in the Los Angeles area, he was coached at the Los Angeles Tennis Club. Playing for the University of Southern California, he won the N.C.A.A. singles and doubles championships in 1956 and 1958.

Olmedo won his two singles matches and a doubles match, teaming with Ham Richardson, to lead the United States to victory over a strong Australian team in the 1958 Davis Cup final, at Brisbane. His selection for the American squad proved controversial, since he was not a United States citizen. But regulations permitted a player to compete for a country after at least three years of continued residence. And Peru did not have its own entry in Davis Cup play. Allison Danzig, the longtime tennis writer for The New York Times, wrote that Olmedo's selection showed that U.S. tennis authorities gave ""equal opportunity to every player, to the foreign born as well as the homebred."" But Arthur Daley wrote in his column, Sports of The Times, that Olmedo's participation ""has to make American tennis the laughingstock of the rest of the world."" Don Budge, the 1938 Grand Slam champion, responding to a Sports Illustrated survey of sentiment among leading tennis figures, wrote: ""Selecting Olmedo isn't saying there is something wrong with our tennis. However, we should stimulate more interest here to match Australia's."" Olmedo, who held a student visa while playing for U.S.C., said that if he decided to remain in the country permanently he would become a citizen. He did, many years later.

Late in the 1958 season, Olmedo teamed with Richardson to win the men's doubles title at Forest Hills. Olmedo was at his best on fast surfaces, where he could display his quickness and forge an aggressive game. His extraordinary 1959 season began when he defeated Neale Fraser of Australia in four sets for the Australian championship. He downed another Australian, Rod Laver, who at the time was only 20 years old and unseeded, in straight sets in the Wimbledon final, adding lobs to his customary serve-and-volley game along with strong groundstrokes. Olmedo lost to Fraser in the Forest Hills singles final. After only two seasons as an amateur (and long before the Open era, when professionals were allowed to compete alongside amateurs), Olmedo joined Jack Kramer's touring pro circuit. He defeated Tony Trabert for the 1960 U.S. Pro Tennis title. Olmedo retired from competitive play in the mid-1960s. He was a longtime teaching pro at the Beverly Hills Hotel, a magnet for Hollywood stars, where his pupils included Katharine Hepburn and Robert Duvall. Alejandro Olmedo was born on March 24, 1936, in Arequipa. His survivors include his son, Alejandro Jr.; two daughters, Amy and Angela; and four grandchildren. His marriage to Ann Olmedo ended in divorce. Olmedo was the second International Tennis Hall of Fame inductee to die in recent days. Dennis Ralston, also a star at U.S.C. and a five-time doubles champion in majors, died on Dec. 6 in Austin, Texas.","In 1959, Olmedo won the Australian and Wimbledon men's single championships and reached the final of the United States Nationals.",e9d1588a-4212-553a-8ff1-049d04dcfe75,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/14/obituaries/12Olmedo4/12Olmedo4-facebookJumbo.jpg,Alex Olmedo in action against Neale Fraser of Australia in 1959.

Style,"Buying Black, Rebooted",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/25/style/buying-black-rebooted.html,"Those are common conscientious consumer queries these days. For a growing number of Americans, though, another question is taking precedence: ""Is this a black-owned business?"" What used to be considered a statement of radical Afrocentricism is now little different from ""buy green, buy woman-owned or even buy American,"" said Maggie Anderson, the author of ""Our Black Year: One Family's Quest to Buy Black in America's Racially Divided Economy,"" via email. Like those movements, buying black broadcasts one's politics. But it is also a hit-them-where-it-hurts response to big brands that make racist gaffe (see: blackface balaclavas) after racist gaffe (see: Little Black Sambo charms). By buying black, consumers are consciously disengaging from the viral cycle of corporate ignorance, public outrage and corporate apology. And in the face of today's fraught politics and overt racism, it marks a return to a form of economic protest from another time in America's not-so-distant history.

The Long History of Black Business in America Buying black has been at the center of the fight for civil rights since Reconstruction. In the days after emancipation, black businesses flourished. Though the government never ponied up the promised 40 acres and a mule, many black Americans were able to build thriving general stores, barbershops and funeral homes. Bustling areas of economic activity were called ""Black Wall Streets"" and could be found all over the country, most famously in Tulsa, Okla., Richmond, Va., and Birmingham, Ala. Incensed by their success and competition, white Americans laid waste to entire communities, salting the earth with lynchings, tax sales, predatory land speculation and disenfranchisement. Over the years, every prominent figure in the movement for racial equality implored their brothers and sisters to spend money within the community and boycott white businesses to, in the words of Martin Luther King Jr., ""redistribute the pain"" Jim Crow inflicted. The day before he was assassinated, Dr. King had a ""buy black"" message in his ""I've Been to the Mountaintop"" speech.

Paradoxically, integration hurt black businesses, marking a steady decline in the type of collective economics that had been the norm. Black Americans were hobbled as entrepreneurs, but not as consumers, as multinational companies began targeting them or creating separate products of sometimes unequal quality. ""In the '80s, it became fashionable to abandon our own banks and businesses, to show and prove how equal we are, that we were good enough to buy products and shop at stores once denied to us,"" Mrs. Anderson said. But in recent years, as black culture sets trends but often doesn't see any profits from it, many consumers are making a pointed return to spending their money at black-owned businesses. ""Every time you spend your money, I would argue you're voting,"" said Kristian Henderson, the founder of BLK + GRN, a marketplace in Washington, D.C., selling all-natural products made by black artisans. ""You're voting on what companies are successful and what companies aren't. I think more people are recognizing that their dollars are that powerful."" ""Racism is inherent to the fabric that is America, and there's really nothing we can do to change that,"" she said. ""But what we can do is be really, really conscientious about how we spend our money. ""

There was a time when people looking for black-owned companies to patronize had a hard time finding them. Big-box stores and chains made convenience, not provenance, king. Why do the legwork of tracking down several different items when you can get everything you need in one place? ""All the things I needed as a black person I typically wasn't buying from black people,"" said Jazzi McGilbert, the founder of Reparations Club, a marketplace that opened in Los Angeles in June. ""We just needed the things that we needed when we needed them, and we got that where we could."" Now a new wave of entrepreneurs have created businesses -- e-commerce platforms, bricks-and-mortar shops, subscription boxes and pop-up markets -- that primarily or exclusively sell black-owned products. Customers are looking for more than just ""shea butters and dashikis,"" said Nikki Porcher, the founder of the nonprofit Buy From a Black Woman. ""If you can go to one place and find all of these buyers and sellers under one house,"" she said, ""that gets rid of the excuses of 'I can't find' or 'I don't know.'"" (Ms. McGilbert and Ms. Porcher have worked with my black motherhood company.)

The e-commerce platform We Buy Black may be closest to meeting the big-box model. Along with its marketplace, it also plans to create a supermarket called Soul Food Market in Atlanta. We Buy Black stands out for selling products you would think would be hardest to find -- that is, ""black versions"" of things like batteries, laundry detergent and dog food. ""A segment of our community was doubtful that we would be able to produce everything we want and need,"" Shareef Abdul-Malik, the chief executive of the platform, said via email. Over time, he said, We Buy Black was able to release everyday products to replace ones from larger nonblack-owned companies -- products like toothbrushes, detergent, toilet tissue and shaving razors. BLK + GRN, which opened in early 2018, has curated scores of high-quality wellness brands for discerning consumers, like Golde, a line of single-origin turmeric powders; the Honey Pot Company, a line of plant-based feminine care products; and Black Girl Sunscreen, which doesn't leave behind sunscreen's usual telltale white residue. BLK + GRN has been successful from the start, with ""around $100,000 in revenue"" in its first year, Ms. Henderson said. It also delivers for vendors. ""On the wholesale side, BLK + GRN is our top performer, even topping the sales of our largest retail partner, Whole Foods Market,"" Leigh Byers, the founder of a cosmetics and skin care line called Hunnybunny Boutique, wrote in an email.

Black spending power, currently at $1.3 trillion, is on track to reach $1.5 trillion by 2021, according to a report by Nielsen. The group outspends in proportion to its population in several categories, from ethnic hair care and beauty (85 percent) to bottled water (16 percent). Yet most of their money goes to white-owned multinational companies. Diversity programs that help promote emerging businesses owned by minorities lump all minority groups together (including businesses owned by veterans, L.G.B.T.Q. and disabled people), Mrs. Anderson said. This can obscure who is actually getting the contracts. ""From what I've heard from some of the vendors at my space, they have a hard time being taken seriously by buyers,"" Ms. McGilbert said. ""Some of the excuses white retailers will give is 'the quality is not up to par,' 'the packaging's not up to par.' There's all these expenses that go into developing brands that can sit comfortably on Sephora's shelves. But I find they'll walk people through the process and help them get there, and a lot of people aren't doing that with black-owned brands."" There is also an ignorance of black consumer needs. Ms. McGilbert sells Baby Tress, a $15 luxury edge brush, at her store. Baby Tress is an upgrade from the beauty supply store options black women have used for years to style their baby hairs. (Styling baby hairs has become so trendy that a Spanish beauty influencer tried to make drawing them on popular. It didn't take.) ""I think they will be on shelves in Target and Sephora,"" Ms. McGilbert said, referring to Baby Tress, ""but they're having to convince people that people want this product because buyers for these stores have no idea.""

Access to capital is a recurring barrier to growth for businesses of all stripes, but traditional financing options are especially difficult for black owners. When black entrepreneurs do get loans, they tend to receive lower amounts and at higher interest rates than other groups. Black women, the fastest growing segment of business owners, are the least likely to receive investments from venture capitalists. They account for less than 1 percent of the $424.7 billion raised in tech V.C. funding since 2009, according to the 2018 Project Diane study conducted by DigitalUndivided, an organization that empowers women entrepreneurs of color. Michelle Dalzon is confronting this reality as she plans the next phase of the Black-Owned Market, or theBOM, her three-year-old pop-up. Ms. Dalzon put on her first event in New York in December 2016 without sponsors. It was a huge success -- guests came from as far away as Ohio to shop -- but it depleted her savings. ""That whole market, altogether, was, like, $16,000 that I have not recouped yet,"" she said. Since then, Ms. Dalzon has worked with brands like Airbnb, Blavity and Jack Daniel's, and introduced a pop-up experience in Boston as well as an e-commerce site. But now that the pop-up field has become oversaturated, Ms. Dalzon wants to build a permanent market that could be a multiuse space catering to black-owned brands. Instead of going the V.C. route, Ms. Dalzon has opted for angel investment. ""It's important for me to make sure they're the right investment partners for theBOM,"" she said. ""Not everyone who is willing to give you money is going to be the right partner."" ""Once you take V.C. funding, the clock starts ticking,"" she continued. ""You have eight to 10 years to get your start-up in a position to sell. I'm not sure if I want to sell, or if it's something that I want to keep in my family for generations.""

As much as the Buy Black movement calls attention to systemic issues, it also holds up a mirror to the community. Many black businesses say that even after addressing the discoverability issue, they still have the hurdle of overcoming black consumer bias toward black businesses. ""We vote black, church black, but we do not buy black,"" Mrs. Anderson said. ""These owners feel like no one is in their corner."" That sentiment has led to two oft-repeated, though most likely apocryphal, statistics. One is that only 2 cents of every black dollar is spent with black-owned businesses. The other, though debunked by a media student at Howard University, has grown legs and hands to wag a disappointed finger: A dollar's life span is 28 days in Asian communities, 19 days in Jewish communities and a mere six hours in black communities. Though these numbers are hard to substantiate, their existence is an attempt to call attention to the ""we support our own"" ethos people say they see in other groups -- and how other communities profit from majority black consumer bases without reinvesting in the community. (Even though black Americans spend nine times more on their hair than other races, Korean-Americans own 70 percent of the beauty supply stores in America, according to reporting by the public radio station WOSU in Columbus, Ohio.)

""I am the result of a black-owned business,"" she said. ""I was able to get a proper education, to really experience the world in a different way,"" she said. ""I feel like if you can support a black-owned brand, that's what you're supporting."" Support isn't limited to one type of consumer either. ""It's not just black people buying black, it's other people buying black and realizing why that is important,"" said Ms. McGilbert, who has spoken to her nonblack friends about buying black. ""When I presented that as a form of activism that they could partake in very easily, they've been very receptive. Whether it's white guilt or activism or allyship, they are looking for ways to be a part of this movement."" For those on the outside looking in, the Buy Black movement can be seen for what it is: a concerted effort to right a long history of wrongs. Or, it can be seen as an instance of ""reverse racism"" (which is not a thing), a hypocritical attempt to segregate or be exclusionary. ""How can anyone look at what is happening to the black community and not support the people from that community trying to show accountability instead of asking those who claim it is not their fault, not their problem, to help us?"" Mrs. Anderson said. Ms. Porcher said: ""It's only offensive to those who want to be offended. White people aren't going out of their way to find other white businesses because they're there -- they've always been there. If our cities didn't get burned down, if our streets that were filled with nothing but black businesses didn't get burned down, we wouldn't have to go seek them because they would already be there. They would be the Nikes, and the Walmarts, because those legacies would have been built.""","In the newest iteration of the Buy Black movement, entrepreneurs are creating marketplaces that pool black-owned brands in one space.",1b1bcc04-eb2f-5dbe-891d-5c281ff7e1fa,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/26/fashion/24BUYBLACK-Black-Owned-Market-1/24BUYBLACK-Black-Owned-Market-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=62fda7cd3198273b19e45b9fdea38e0852e420aff466babbd9347d86b68a2b8b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Michelle Dalzon of the Black-Owned Market in Boston.,1b1bcc04-eb2f-5dbe-891d-5c281ff7e1fa,N24News/imgs/1b1bcc04-eb2f-5dbe-891d-5c281ff7e1fa.jpg,15
Opinion,Will the Largest Quarantine in History Just Make Things Worse?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/opinion/china-wuhan-virus-quarantine.html,"It's the largest quarantine in human history, but will it stop the disease? In response to the new and still poorly understood coronavirus that recently emerged in Wuhan, central China, the Chinese government has placed the city and a dozen others in lockdown -- in effect quarantining an estimated 56 million people. The cities have been sealed off; transportation in and out of them has stopped. Schools are closed, and traditional celebrations for the Lunar New Year have been suspended. Yet as of Monday, at least 80 people had died, more than 2,740 were confirmed to have been infected and cases had been detected in at least 10 other countries. Other governments have taken similar measures. Hong Kong has banned the arrival of travelers from Hubei Province, where Wuhan is located, and has set up isolation centers in two holiday villages to monitor people who have had contact with carriers of the virus. Zhong Nanshan, of China's National Health Commission, is reported to have said that the most effective way to stop the virus, which appears to be spread by droplets, was a quarantine.

In Wuhan, a city of 11 million, both patients who believe they have been infected by the coronavirus and people with other medical problems are having difficulty seeing doctors: Shortages are common at such times, and quarantines only compound them. Residents are complaining on social media about inadequate care. Distrust of the health authorities is mounting. And then, of course, overcrowding at hospitals, which mixes some presumably sick people with the healthy, increases the risks of transmission. Some people may have tried to escape the stricken cities for less-infected areas. Others may be hiding from public health workers. A woman from Wuhan, apparently eager to stick to her travel plans for Lunar New Year, reportedly cheated a health check by taking fever-reducing drugs to bring her temperature down -- and then admitted doing so on social media after she had arrived in France. An integral failing of most quarantines is that some people, seeing the restrictions as overly strict and an imposition on their rights, will invariably try to bypass them. Their evasion, in turn, can endanger public health. So, do quarantines contain a disease or might they actually contribute to spreading it? China's health authorities will probably eventually argue that there would have been many more cases had they not locked down cities. But that claim is a negative that cannot be proved. And in my opinion, at this stage, the quarantines decreed by the Chinese government will not help end the crisis.

Quarantine laws -- from the Italian ""quaranta giorni,"" meaning 40 days -- were first developed in Venice in 1370, to keep the bubonic plague at bay by banning any ships and goods for the time it seemed to take most epidemics to burn themselves out. The measures' effectiveness then was never studied, yet the practice was refined over time. During the industrial age, for example, European nations reinforced quarantines with ""cordons sanitaires"" -- a ring of armed guards preventing the entry or exit of anyone deemed or feared ill with an epidemic disease. By the 19th century, many major cities in Europe and the United States had a ""lazaretto"" -- a remote island or containment facility to isolate the sick and those suspected of being sick. Before the advent of effective vaccines, intravenous fluids and other medication, the people who were segregated were rarely cared for, and many died. In numerous instances, too, quarantines were used to separate people considered to be dirty or undesirable. In January 1892, an epidemic of deadly typhus fever broke out among Russian Jewish immigrants settled in boardinghouses on the Lower East Side in New York City. The local Health Department rounded them up, along with other Jewish residents who happened to live nearby. Hundreds of immigrants -- but no other New Yorkers who were ill or suspected of being ill -- were quarantined in tents on North Brother Island in the East River. Some contracted typhus as a result of being crowded in with the sick. Later that year, New York State's quarantine officer, William Jenkins, diverted to remote islands hundreds of impoverished East European, Jewish passengers coming from Europe and Asia in the steerage section of ships. The measure was designed to forestall the spread of an outbreak of cholera that had originated in Hamburg, Germany, then the largest port in the world -- only it did not apply to first-class passengers. Dr. Jenkins was thought to have overshot, was roundly criticized and eventually lost his job.

The 1918-19 influenza pandemic killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide, including up to 750,000 in the United States. In 2007, I led a group of researchers to study the use of what we called non-pharmaceutical interventions in America. We looked at 43 large cities that employed some combination of (1) isolating the ill or suspected cases in hospitals or at home, (2) banning public gatherings and, in some cases, shutting down roads and railways, and (3) closing schools. We found that in the cities that acted early, for sustained periods, and that simultaneously used more than one measure, rates of morbidity and mortality were lower than in the cities that did not take such measures. We concluded that in the face of a severe influenza pandemic, non-pharmaceutical interventions should be considered to complement vaccines, prophylactic medication and treatment -- though only as a last resort and only for a highly lethal infection because they are extremely disruptive to society. In 2009, during the first days of an H1N1 influenza outbreak in Mexico, the Health Ministry immediately deployed a spate of 1918-style measures. Suspected cases were isolated. Schools were closed. Public gatherings were banned, including a regional soccer tournament. Although those moves did work to limit new cases of influenza, they were abandoned 18 days later, partly because of the huge social and economic costs. More important, even as the H1N1 influenza virus circulated widely -- the outbreak was, indeed, a pandemic -- it turned out to not be nearly as deadly as a garden-variety seasonal flu. (The common flu kills about 35,000 people a year in the United States alone.) The Mexican government concluded, appropriately, that the stringent measures it had adopted should be lifted given the disease's relatively limited total toll -- between 4,200 and 12,000 dead in the end -- even if it might keep spreading.

Today, China is adopting classic quarantine measures but on a scale never before seen, let alone studied. Its reaction is perhaps understandable, given the searing memory of the SARS epidemic of 2002-3 and the criticism that was directed at the government for its early attempts to conceal or minimize the extent of the disease. But it may now be overreacting, and after the coronavirus epidemic's inflection point, imposing an unjustifiable burden on the population. In the early days of any epidemic, even as leaders come under great pressure to do something, little critical information is available to make truly informed decisions about the best course of action. At this stage of the Wuhan case, though, the virus has already spread, and according to local authorities, some five million people left the city after the beginning of the outbreak and before the lockdown. Given that, China should be prescribing that its citizens remain calm, stay at home if they are sick, practice good hand-washing and respiratory hygiene, and avoid crowded places, if possible. It must also step up health care measures to tend to both the ill and the worried well. With the Wuhan coronavirus, as with other epidemics past, quarantine measures may be too much too late.

Wantz Distinguished Professor of the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan and the author of ""Quarantine!"" and ""When Germs Travel.""",The dirty history behind isolating the sick.,97195dbe-06cd-522a-bcde-b93c2dea1e4b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/27/opinion/27markelWeb/27markelWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=efb7c19ced09ab28cc7a6d9c84b4e6bbd482ae84c355327005f897a6097c2328&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Medical staff in protective clothing at the Red Cross Hospital in Wuhan, central China, the epicenter of an outbreak of viral pneumonia.",97195dbe-06cd-522a-bcde-b93c2dea1e4b,N24News/imgs/97195dbe-06cd-522a-bcde-b93c2dea1e4b.jpg,11
Automobiles,Chrysler Recalls 1.2 Million Ram Trucks,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/09/automobiles/some-2014-models-are-recalled-by-jeep-and-toyota.html,"Chrysler is recalling about 1.2 million Ram trucks to correct problems that could result in a loss of steering, as well as almost 94,000 of its 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokees because of electronic problems that could disable two safety systems, the automaker said on Friday.

In a statement, the company said it was aware of seven accidents involving the Rams, resulting in two injuries. A Chrysler spokesman, Eric Mayne, said in an email that he was not aware of the extent of the injuries.

The automaker estimated that 453,000 of the trucks would need repairs because the steering systems' tie rods were not aligned properly, though it said it needed to recall all 1.2 million trucks to find the flawed vehicles.

Earlier Friday, Chrysler told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in a report on the safety agency's website of the problems in the Jeep Grand Cherokees.","The company also recalled 2014-model Jeep Grand Cherokees, and Toyota recalled some of its 2013-14 Tacoma pickup trucks.",05e0ea39-0b39-5f14-a058-88cd46d979bf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/09/automobiles/09Recallpic/09Recallpic-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=370&w=600&s=2f91c5b99861320b91c0f6177f723d65e9c6eeb8e502d7590d3e923424d2822a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,A software problem with the antilock braking module could disable the antilock braking and electronic stability-control systems in 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokees.,05e0ea39-0b39-5f14-a058-88cd46d979bf,N24News/imgs/05e0ea39-0b39-5f14-a058-88cd46d979bf.jpg,23

Sports,Updates on Sports Canceled by Coronavirus,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/sports/sports-canceled-coronavirus.html,"A day after nearly every major sporting event in the United States had been suspended or canceled because of the coronavirus, it became a question of which sports were on, not which were off. One of the biggest sporting events of the year, the Masters golf tournament, will be postponed, it was announced Friday. The Boston Marathon will be rescheduled for September. The N.B.A., the N.H.L., M.L.S. and Major League Baseball suspended play. The N.C.A.A. canceled all of its championships, including the men's basketball tournament, which supplies most of its annual budget. Around Europe, more leagues shut down their seasons, joining Asia, which has been almost without sporting events for weeks.

The Masters will be postponed, according to an announcement Friday from officials at Augusta National Golf Club, the host of the event. On Thursday night, the PGA Tour, which conducts the bulk of the professional golf events in North America, announced it was canceling several tournaments and suspending operations until the week of the Masters, which is scheduled for April 9 to 12. ""We hope this postponement puts us in the best position to safely host the Masters tournament and our amateur events at some later date,"" tournament organizers said in a statement.

The Masters is the first golf major championship of the year and has been played every year since 1934, except from 1943 to 1945, when it was canceled because of World War II.

* Playoff Simulator: Explore every team's path to the postseason, updated live. Tiger Woods, in one of the most memorable sporting events of 2019, came from behind to win the tournament last year. It was Woods's 15th major championship. Woods has been sidelined in recent weeks resting his surgically repaired back. After initially announcing that the Players Championship in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., another of its important events, would proceed without fans, the PGA Tour decided late Thursday to cancel it as well as its next three events in Florida and Texas. An event in the Dominican Republic had been canceled earlier in the day. Earlier Thursday, Jay Monahan, the commissioner of the PGA Tour, had said that since golf is an outdoor sport played in a vast expanse -- the T.P.C.-Sawgrass golf course is more than 400 acres -- it made for ""a safe environment."" The L.P.G.A. Tour had previously announced the postponement of three events in the United States, having previously canceled two Asian events. The Premier League in England became the latest soccer league to suspend games, after Mikel Arteta, the manager of Arsenal, and the Chelsea player Callum Hudson-Odoi tested positive for the virus. (Arteta tweeted Friday that he was ""feeling better already."" Games will not be played in the top four divisions until April 3. Scotland also suspended its games. Arsenal, Chelsea and Everton have all quarantined some players.

England and Scotland join almost every other major league in Europe, including France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and a host of smaller countries. Germany was the last major league to surrender to the tide of cancellations, deciding Friday to stop games until April 2. All Champions League and Europa League games have been suspended indefinitely. Most Asian countries suspended play some weeks ago, and with Major League Soccer suspended, that leaves games for the most part only in Mexico, Africa and some of South America, for now. Besides the suspension of M.L.S., United States men's and women's team friendlies in March and April have been canceled. Formula One canceled its season-opening race in Australia. (Australian rules football there will start its season, but without fans.) Races in China, Bahrain and Vietnam were postponed, meaning the season would open in May at the earliest. NASCAR postponed its race in Atlanta this weekend and Miami next week. IndyCar suspended races through April.

Thursday started with the dominolike cancellation of just about every college conference tournament. The first game of the Big East tournament quarterfinals tipped off as scheduled at Madison Square Garden, but the tournament was canceled at halftime. Then late Thursday afternoon, the national basketball tournaments were scrapped. All other winter and spring college championships were also canceled. Donovan Mitchell became the second N.B.A. player known to have tested positive for the coronavirus. The N.B.A. suspended its season after the first, another Jazz player, Rudy Gobert, tested positive. Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, said the league's suspension would probably last ""at least 30 days."" Silver said it was possible that the rest of the season would be canceled. The top European basketball competition, Euroleague, suspended all games until April 11.

Following the lead of other major sports leagues, the National Hockey League announced Thursday that it was pausing its season, effective immediately. The N.H.L. did not indicate how long the stoppage would last or when it would try to begin play again, saying only that the league's goal was ""to resume play as soon as it is appropriate and prudent."" Most N.H.L. teams have about a dozen games left in the regular season, with the Stanley Cup playoffs scheduled to begin in about a month. The National Women's Hockey League said its Isobel Cup final between the Boston Pride and the Minnesota Whitecaps, set for Friday, had been postponed. The N.F.L. canceled its annual owners' meeting scheduled for March 29 to April 1 in Palm Beach, Fla., and opted to carry over much of its agenda to their meeting in late May. The meeting includes owners, coaches and general managers, and attracts hundreds of news media members from around the country. The league said in a statement that it would continue ""essential business operations"" but would consult with experts on new developments. No mention was made of changes to plans for the N.F.L. draft, which is slated to take place April 23 to 25 in Las Vegas. President Trump added his voice to the conversation on Thursday, suggesting that the Games in Tokyo should be postponed for a year rather than being held without spectators. Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee, has insisted that the Games are on schedule to begin in late July, though a member of Japan's Olympic organizing committee said Tuesday that postponing the Games should be discussed. ""Maybe they postpone it for a year,"" Mr. Trump said of the Olympics. ""Maybe that's not possible."" Mr. Trump's comments came during a news briefing at the White House, where he talked about numerous measures his administration and others were taking to combat the spread of the coronavirus.

The Olympic flame lighting ceremony in Greece on Thursday was held without spectators, and the torch relay was suspended Friday morning after larger crowds than expected turned up to watch. Major League Baseball postponed the start of its regular season, scheduled for March 26, by at least two weeks and canceled all remaining spring training games. Japan has postponed the start of its baseball season, scheduled for March 20, until April. The Boston Marathon, a spring staple on the sports calendar, will instead be held on Sept. 14. The New York City Half Marathon, scheduled for Sunday, has been canceled. The London Marathon was delayed until October. The Paris and Barcelona Marathons have also been delayed until October. The Rome Marathon on March 29 has been canceled. The World Figure Skating Championships in Montreal, scheduled to run March 18 to 22, have been canceled. The event was expected to feature about 200 skaters from more than 50 countries. The women's world ice hockey championship, to be played in Canada beginning March 31, has been canceled. The Alpine World Cup finals, scheduled to begin March 18 in Italy, have been canceled. The last three races of the women's skiing World Cup, to be held in Sweden, were canceled. The Indian Premier League, the richest league in the world, in a country where cricket's popularity is off the charts, postponed the start of its season until April 15. England called off its tour of Sri Lanka, which had already begun with exhibition matches. ""These are completely unprecedented times, and decisions like this go beyond cricket,"" the English Cricket Board said in a statement. South Africa and India canceled international games as well.",The Masters and the Boston Marathon join in the postponements.,d9a93b42-2024-57d8-b57e-7dc481bcda6c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/14/sports/13virus-sports-print/13masters-canceled-tiger-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=bea532430ae16e769e1f3b8b4d7c2a677d1ecfe7e6cdc141e83b82a4f6c44f5a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Masters will not be held as scheduled.,d9a93b42-2024-57d8-b57e-7dc481bcda6c,N24News/imgs/d9a93b42-2024-57d8-b57e-7dc481bcda6c.jpg,9
Technology,Amazon Sellers Brood as States Come Calling for Taxes,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/technology/amazon-sales-tax.html,"SEATTLE -- Amazon and the tax man are back at it again. For years, the company and state governments scuffled over Amazon's resistance to charging state sales tax, which helped keep prices low on its e-commerce site and angered politicians and other retailers. Eventually, Amazon began adding the tax in states across the country. But there was a loophole. Amazon added the tax only when the item came from its own inventory, not from the millions of independent merchants who sell products through Amazon's website. Amazon left it up to those sellers -- who account for half of all items sold on the site -- to collect sales tax on their own. But, according to sellers, tax lawyers and accountants who work with them, most do not. Now states, thirsty for the millions of dollars in unpaid sales taxes revenue, are coming for their money. Amazon recently warned its sellers that the company, as of Jan. 1, would be collecting sales tax from merchants who ship orders to its home state, Washington, as it seeks to comply with a state law signed in July. That will be the first time Amazon has collected a state sales tax for the merchants known as marketplace sellers on its site.

It is a grudging concession by the online retail giant. In South Carolina, the company is fighting an effort by the state's Department of Revenue to use existing laws to force Amazon to collect tax on marketplace sales. The state is arguing that Amazon owes it $57 million in such taxes from last year. A judge's decision in the case is pending. Other states are going after Amazon's sellers, a much less powerful target, for unpaid sales taxes. In Massachusetts, a judge in late September ordered Amazon to give the state information about merchants who stored goods in the state. Sellers have reported receiving letters from tax investigators in California, too. Consumers may absorb much of the new costs. Depending on the state, sales tax can add 5 percent to nearly 10 percent to the cost of an order. Jill Kerr, a spokeswoman for Amazon, declined to comment. In a recent filing with regulators, Amazon singled out South Carolina's effort as a risk. ""If South Carolina or other states were successfully to seek additional adjustments of a similar nature, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities,"" Amazon said in the filing. ""We intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter."" Taxes remain a political sore spot for Amazon, even as it has become one of the most successful companies in the world. President Trump has even taken to criticizing the business on Twitter as a ""no-tax monopoly,"" attacks that often appear prompted by coverage of him in The Washington Post, which is personally owned by Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive.

Caught in the middle are Amazon's marketplace sellers, who run the gamut from small mom-and-pop operations to more sophisticated merchants boasting teams of employees. On Amazon's marketplace, sellers list their products for sale and determine the price. Many take advantage of an additional program, called Fulfillment by Amazon, through which their inventory is stored in Amazon's warehouses and shipped by the company. The sellers pay Amazon fees for those services, but the e-commerce giant leaves it up to them to collect sales tax where they are required to do so. The fees Amazon charges its marketplace sellers are a huge business for the company, totaling nearly $8 billion during its most recent quarter, up from $5.65 billion a year earlier.

""There's a lot of anxiety,"" said Chris McCabe, who previously worked at Amazon and now provides consulting services to merchants. ""There's a lot of ambiguity here."" Many Amazon sellers, Mr. McCabe said, live in fear of getting a letter or phone call from a state investigator that leads to a hefty bill for uncollected back sales taxes, which could also come with penalties and interest. The sellers interviewed for this article would speak only on the condition of anonymity, saying they feared attracting the notice of such an investigator. Sales taxes on e-commerce are governed by a 1992 Supreme Court decision, Quill Corporation v. North Dakota, which established that states cannot collect taxes from companies that did not have a physical presence there. In its early days, Amazon took advantage of that law by keeping its warehouses out of populous states like California. But as the company has grown and focused more on reducing delivery times, it reached deals with many states to set up warehouses inside their borders. As part of those agreements, Amazon typically agreed to begin charging sales taxes after a delay of a few years. Sellers who sign up for Fulfillment by Amazon are probably the most exposed to the state income tax laws. As part of the program, their merchandise gets distributed to numerous Amazon warehouses. Most states take the position that having their inventory in a warehouse, even if the facility belongs to Amazon, creates a duty to charge sales tax on marketplace sales in those states. Not all advisers agree. One electronics seller, who has millions of dollars in annual sales on Amazon, said he only collected sales taxes for orders delivered in his state, on the advice of his accountant.

Accountants are not in agreement on the issue either. Michael Fleming, an accountant of Peisner Johnson in Texas, said his firm's business was booming with Amazon marketplace sellers. He advises them, he said, to charge sales tax wherever a state can argue it has a ""nexus"" -- the term most used for a physical presence. He said he believed the reason Amazon has been reluctant to step in and charge sales tax on marketplace orders is that it could assume a large additional liability for any mistakes the sellers make. ""Maybe the seller mislabels something, and tax that should be collected isn't,"" Mr. Fleming said. ""Then Amazon gets audited. Amazon is paying tax out of their pocket when it's really a mistake by an individual seller."" Mr. Fleming said he has heard from clients that the states of Washington and California have been particularly aggressive in going after them for back taxes on Amazon marketplace sales. But it could be that the states are simply focusing on a fast-growing part of retail. ""Given the volume of businesses that make retail sales through Amazon's marketplace platform, it is likely that some of these businesses may have been contacted through the normal course of our tax discovery efforts,"" said Beverly Crichfield, a spokeswoman for Washington's Department of Revenue. With concerns mounting among sellers, the Multistate Tax Commission, an intergovernmental state tax agency, recently offered an amnesty program that frees marketplace sellers from back tax liabilities when they take steps to collect them on current sales. But some states, including New York, California and Washington, did not participate in the program. Only 852 sellers out of the hundreds of thousands estimated to be selling on Amazon applied for the program. Paul Rafelson, an adjunct professor at Pace University's law school and a lawyer who works with Amazon sellers, said he believed that some states were going after sellers for back taxes to avoid a face-off with the company.","Most third-party sellers on Amazon do not collect sales tax. States, thirsty for the millions of dollars in unpaid revenue, are coming for the money.",3915802f-2a03-5791-96df-b92a9936cf7f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/16/business/16AMAZONTAX1/16AMAZONTAX1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=48e088db47320c81b3acf0e8754a2a1868ec777f7bf568526c8cc022071cba31&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The fees Amazon charges its marketplace sellers are a huge business for the company, totaling nearly $8 billion during its most recent quarter, up from $5.65 billion a year earlier.

Science,How Comet 67P's Face Changed During Its Trip Around the Sun,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/23/science/rosetta-comet-67p-landslides-cliff-collapse.html,"How Comet 67P's Face Changed During Its Trip Around the Sun

Cliffs collapsed, boulders moved, cracks opened up, and jets of dust and gas erupted. Those are some of the transmogrifications that scientists discovered as they pored over two years of photographs of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko taken by Rosetta, the European Space Agency spacecraft whose comet-trailing mission came to a conclusion in September. The unexpected shape of the comet -- like a rubber duck instead of a simple sphere -- was most likely the result of a merger of two comets in the distant past. As 67P approached the sun, jets of dust and gas sped up the spin of the comet, increasing stresses on the body. A crack in the neck of the comet, initially about 550 yards long when Rosetta arrived in August 2014, lengthened by 30 to 45 yards A new crack, about 160 yards long, opened up nearby.

""This comet is probably eventually going to split up as it speeds up more and more,"" M. Ramy El-Maarry, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado, said during a news conference on Tuesday at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference outside Houston. ""When is that exactly going to happen? Of course, I have no idea.""

Dr. El-Maarry and his colleagues published their findings this week in the journal Science. A second paper, in the journal Nature Astronomy, described how the collapse of one particular cliff set off an eruption of dust and gas from the comet's surface. Until Rosetta, astronomers had only brief glimpses of comets. Rosetta's journey around the solar system allowed the spacecraft to accompany Comet 67P, about 2.5 miles wide, for two years of its 6.5-year orbit as it approached the sun and then swung back out. In two close-up images of the same spot on the comet, one taken in May 2015, before the comet made its closest approach to the sun, and the other about a year and half later as it was moving away, most features of the landscape were unchanged. But a boulder that was bigger than most houses had moved more than 160 yards, or more than the length of a football field. In the minuscule gravity of the comet, that would have required the same amount of force for lifting a 550-pound boulder on Earth, Dr. El-Maarry said.

Yet none of the events that Rosetta observed could have created the giant cliffs and huge depressions seen on the surface, and the duck-shaped comet, as it sped away from the sun, looked pretty much like the same duck as when Rosetta arrived. That indicated that the comet was much more active earlier in its lifetime, Dr. El-Maarry said. In the Nature Astronomy paper, Maurizio Pajola, a postdoctoral researcher at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., and his colleagues described a collapsed cliff that he had spotted in an image taken in December 2015. But an image of the same spot the previous year showed a rock overhang that had a 230-foot-long, three-foot-wide crack. Dr. Pajola then searched through other images to figure out what had happened. The cliff was intact on July 4, 2015. The next time Rosetta observed it, on July 15, it had collapsed, leaving new boulders piled at the foot of the 440-foot-high cliff, with bright, reflective material from the comet's interior. Dr. Pajola estimated that 780,000 cubic feet of cliff had collapsed -- about the volume of nine Olympic-size swimming pools. A lower-resolution camera observed a plume of dust rising off the same region of Comet 67P on July 10. ""We were pretty sure it was an outburst directly related to the cliff collapse,"" Dr. Pajola said. ""So we were lucky this cliff collapse happened right in front of our eyes.""","During the two years that the Rosetta spacecraft stalked the comet, it observed cliffs that collapsed, boulders that moved and eruptions of dust and gas.",59f2f6ac-97eb-58d3-9886-4880f560146b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/23/science/23tb-rosetta01/23tb-rosetta01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=536&w=1024&s=9595ed97bbc044c10e3f65bb7b8090eec0f88c5e1c7bf21e980de000a3b9c186&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An image of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko taken by the Rosetta spacecraft in July 2015.

Dance,Twyla Tharp Wants You to Move,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/arts/dance/twyla-tharp-keep-it-moving-book.html,"Take up space. Stretch. Move your body. ""God gives you one gift: You get to be born,"" the choreographer Twyla Tharp said. ""Thereafter, you've got to take care of it yourself."" Her new book, ""Keep It Moving: Lessons for the Rest of Your Life,"" doesn't have anything to do with chasing youth. No, no, no -- to Ms. Tharp, 78, that is a losing proposition. But it's not over until it's over. ""The figures are still shocking in terms of people who don't exercise or who are not aware of the reality that diet is actually extremely important, "" she said. ""If you want to have a future, you've got to provide for that now."" And Ms. Tharp, a dance pioneer and Tony-Award-winning choreographer, is ready to assist. She has already written two books about how to better yourself using the tools of an artist: ""The Creative Habit"" (2003), a best seller, and ""The Collaborative Habit"" (2009). ""Keep It Moving,"" a follow-up, applies those tools to finding purpose and growth as you age, no matter what age you are.

Not that ""Keep It Moving,"" to be published by Simon & Schuster on Oct. 29, is a self-help book exactly, though it's full of bits of wisdom : ""After we terrorize ourselves with self-doubt, our only relief is to get moving again."" And there is practical advice, too. Never, for instance, fight a fall. Above all, Ms. Tharp is a motivator. The text is illustrated not with pictures, but with descriptions of simple exercises: Each chapter features one, ranging from ""Squirm,"" a wriggling sequence of motions that she recommends trying out in bed, to ""Take Up Space,"" which is both a physical and mental act. Here, she connects the reader to a dancer's intuitive way of moving bigger, with amplitude. ""You can think the same way in your everyday movements,"" she writes. ""When you walk, think of yourself striding, not just taking mingy steps."" The brain is one thing; the body is quicker. ""We all think the mind is smarter, and excuse me!"" she said in her galvanizing way. The body's reflexes, she continued, are ""much faster than the brain can process and come up with a concept."" "" That's all I'm saying here,"" she explained. ""Everybody get connected to your body."" But how does she do that?

""Would you care to walk with me for a moment?"" she asked. I would. ""Good girl,"" she replied. During our promenade around her studio -- a pristine, wide-open space in the center of her apartment on the Upper West Side -- she focused on the task at hand, all the while making odd, little animal-like noises. She instructed herself in real time: ""Walk straight ahead. It really has to be down the middle of the metatarsal so the whole leg is rotated in. The back has to be really strong. Sternum up. You do this for quite a long time depending on how bad the feet are."" (Hers are bad.)

She moved onto a mat and quickly zipped through her routine, some of it on a large exercise ball, which she loves, ""especially first thing in the morning, if you're not feeling so very up to it,"" she said, ""because you can't help but bounce, and bouncing is good for the knees and the thighs."" Her workout, or, as she put it ""the whole mishegoss,"" involves isometric exercises, crunches (300) and obliques (100 each side), as well as at least 20 minutes on a stationary bike . With the comic timing of a vaudeville performer -- Ms. Tharp, deep down, is something of a clown -- she flipped her body to arch over the ball and stretched out her back. ""You have to take your temperature at every part of your body,"" she continued. ""And you see how much space it takes: not much."" All that's required, she added, is "" a space patch and no fancy clothes."" In other words, you can do it at home. In your own way, at your own level: Start with 30 crunches. In the book, h er philosophy is guided by the body's need and ability -- in small or large ways -- to move.

She taught the dancers all of the material. (How many 78-year-old women can demonstrate steps?) ""I'm certainly not promoting myself as the ultimate exemplar of this movement,"" she said. ""But I do still have right and left, and I prefer in rehearsals to stay on my feet."" Those feet are why she sticks to a 1,200-calorie-a-day diet. ""It's a little crazy,"" she said. ""But it helps me keep myself on the bone, which is important, because the less weight I put onto feet, the better off we are."" Ms. Tharp has worked hard over the years to maintain her health and physical well-being. But her body has taken some knocks. Still, until she was 65, she said, she could do almost anything. Then, physically, everything began to decline. ""I got nothing for free anymore,"" she said. ""I had to work hard for every little thing, and that could be discouraging, to say the least. So how to maximize that? How do we learn from some of these newer moves that the body comes up with just to survive?""

And how does Ms. Tharp learn from her own injuries? Recently, she underwent hip surgery; she was determined to come back better than before -- and with a goal: to improve her balance, which, she said, ""has always sucked."" Just before our walk, she kneaded th e top of a well-worn foot to break up its calcium deposits. All of her metatarsals have been broken, she said, at one point or anothe r. ""I am working now to open the feet,"" she said. The self-massage and walking regimen have done wonders for both her balance and her feet. But things happen. A few weeks ago, she thought she had broken her left foot during a rehearsal at Ballet Theater. (Mercifully, it wasn't a break, but it hurt.) ""I was showing everybody how to do releve,"" she said, the ballet term for rising on the toes. ""I was exhausted and I also had on a pair of jazz shoes, which are much lighter than sneakers."" Even Ms. Tharp can make mistakes. ""You have to prepare for everything, and I hadn't prepared for the jazz shoes,"" she said. ""I just put them on. I haven't used them for five years! Hello? Right ."" Clearly, Ms. Tharp puts in the time to improve herself. But why would a world-class choreographer want to pass on her knowledge to the general population?

And with ""Keep It Moving,"" Ms. Tharp has a clear mission. ""I really tried to write it for the person who is completely not familiar with their body,"" she said, ""and I tried very hard to open up the community of dance, which can seem to the public as elitist -- it actually is not.""

Travel,Five Luxurious Winter Getaways That Offer More Than Downhill Skiing,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/15/travel/winter-hotel-activities-crosscountry-skiing.html,"Little compares with the rush of downhill skiing, but for travelers seeking something different this season, hotels and tour providers offer plenty of other ways to experience the winter scenery.

An eight-day Winter Tatra Adventure with Intrepid Travel features snowshoeing in Poland's Tatra Mountains, a designated Unesco Biosphere Reserve that extends into neighboring Slovakia. A kulig, or traditional sleigh ride, with stops along the way for grilled sausages, is also included, along with Polish cooking lessons in Krakow, accommodations and some meals. All departures this year are 15 percent off if you book in January (from $1,054, with promo code 53298 ).

Prefer something over the top? An Alpine Couples Package at The Alpina Gstaad in the Swiss resort town of Gstaad includes a private helicopter ride to Refuge L'Espace, a small restaurant perched in the Alps with panoramic views of snowcapped Glacier 3000. The two-night package for two, available through March 17, also offers junior suite accommodations, a horse-drawn carriage or husky-drawn sleigh ride around the nearby village of Launen, a couples hammam (or Turkish bath) treatment in the on-site spa, exclusive use of the hotel's private cinema for an evening, and a five-course tasting menu at Sommet, the hotel's Michelin-starred restaurant (from about $5,300).

Snow itself is something of a luxury in Switzerland and Austria, where 50 and 70 percent of slopes have snow-manufacturing capabilities because of inconsistent weather. But the snow-making process has environmental repercussions, prompting Britain-based Responsible Travel to drop itineraries that might contribute to the problem.","Whether you love to ski or not, these hotels and resorts offer plenty of activities to help you enjoy the season in comfort and style.",aac4917b-b069-5e3a-81b0-6037ecec0c09,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/21/travel/21deal1/21deal1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=da95a2a882e47512b96e297a6c6a2492d258d741d920f896f4cdda923ab90f92&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Snowshoeing in Finland with Responsible Travel, one of the attractive activities that doesn&rsquo;t involve speeding down a mountainside.",aac4917b-b069-5e3a-81b0-6037ecec0c09,N24News/imgs/aac4917b-b069-5e3a-81b0-6037ecec0c09.jpg,4
Style,There's Only One Warren Buffett,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/style/warren-buffett-omaha.html,"OMAHA -- Officially, it's known as the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting. Unofficially, a handful of nicknames describe the three-day extravaganza that happens in the first weekend of May, in which tens of thousands of people descend upon Omaha to revel in all things Warren Buffett. There's ""Berkyville,"" which captures the folksy, small-town tenor of the event. There's ""AGM,"" an abbreviation of ""Annual General Meeting,"" preferred by the finance crowd. And there's Mr. Buffett's personal favorite: ""Woodstock for capitalists."" But the most revealing name is the shortest one: the meeting. Just as some New Yorkers refer to the Big Apple as ""the city,"" as if there were only one, scores of attendees consider this shareholders meeting to be in a class of its own.

In part, that's because the atmosphere feels closer to a carnival than a buttoned-up investors' conference. There are tables of merchandise and costumed mascots, Ping-Pong matches and a movie reel of celebrity-filled skits and spoofs. There is an unofficial circuit of V.I.P. parties and piggyback events. At the center of it all is Mr. Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's chief executive, one of the world's most successful investors and the weekend's enthusiastic master of ceremonies.

""There's a cult of personality, and I mean that in a positive way,"" sai d Dan Calkins, the president and chief operating officer of Benjamin Moore. For Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of Initialized Capital and a former executive chairman of Reddit, the fun began long before he touched down in Nebraska. ""There's such a range of people, even just from the plane out of Newark to here,"" he said. Pointing to his business partner, Garry Tan, he added, ""This guy talked to, uh, well, I don't want to name drop."" As if on cue, the investor Li Lu walked up to shake Mr. Ohanian's hand; inches away, John Collison, the chief executive of Stripe, typed away on his laptop. For Mr. Tan, the big names mattered less than the Midwestern sensibilities: ""There is a piece of this that really resonates with us, around being plain-spoken and investing in what you understand,"" he said. The epicenter of the festivities is Omaha's CenturyLink Center exhibition space: One wing is fully devoted to booths of Berkshire Hathaway-owned brands. Friday is known as ""shopping day."" It's a dedicated opportunity for Mr. Buffett's admirers to buy his brands, snack on his preferred foods (See's Candies and Dilly Bars) and take selfies next to his various likenesses (or, in Mr. Tan's case, in an Oscar Mayer hot dog costume ). Another wing is home to a Madison Square Garden-like arena, where the actual shareholders meeting is held on Saturday.

Revelers line up overnight to get in -- or, in capitalist fashion, hire other people to stand in line for them. This year, many people expressed gratitude for the gentle breezes and sunshine, a welcome reprieve from the torrential rainstorms of past years. A handful of revelers were dressed up in bow ties and silver-glitter heels. Others climbed up poles to snap photos of the crowd.

By 7 a.m., attendees were streaming into the arena. Many purchased fluffy pretzels and pink beverages adorned with umbrellas from the concessions stands and settled in to be entertained. A parody of Jay-Z and Alicia Keys's ""Empire State of Mind"" blasted over the loudspeaker, but the lyrics were changed to: ""In Berkshire, financial strength is where dreams are made of, there's nothing you can't do.""

As in previous years, Berkshire Hathaway had created a video reel of skits with celebrities, who ostensibly agree to participate for free. This year Katy Perry was one of about half a dozen big names on the screen, joking about the Left Shark debacle at the Super Bowl in 2015 and comparing the uncoordinated backup dancer to the Oracle of Omaha himself. The right shark, she said, was the one who showed up on time to rehearsal and got none of the credit -- and that was Mr. Buffett's vice chairman Charlie Munger. The crowd applauded loudly.

After the Berkshire Hathaway board was announced and earnings were delivered, the most beloved portion of the show began: Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger held a question-and-answer session, taking on topics like global politics and cryptocurrencies. Mr. Buffett dispensed wise advice and spoke with occasional self-effacing charm. Mr. Munger delivered deadpan one-liners that drew raucous laughs, including his comparison of virtual currencies to ""turds."" ""If you're interested in business, this is the bucket-list event,"" said James Weber, the chief executive of Brooks Sports. ""It's just priceless.""","The Berkshire Hathaway C.E.O.'s three-day extravaganza — er, shareholders' conference — drew tens of thousands of fans to Omaha.",848a99d2-1fee-5a31-8416-f0bfb14a762a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/13/fashion/07BERKSHIRE-lede/07BERKSHIRE-lede-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=3968a2c1d1daca273b374844ba301b27e1028c164d91f19d474a13254a03929a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Shareholders Deborah Kiel, left, and Laura Flynn collected Warren Buffett swag at the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders meeting in Omaha.",848a99d2-1fee-5a31-8416-f0bfb14a762a,N24News/imgs/848a99d2-1fee-5a31-8416-f0bfb14a762a.jpg,15

Movies,I Know Where You Lived Last Summer,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/movies/summer-vacation-home-invasions.html,"This article contains spoilers for ""Us."" In ""Us,"" a family of uncanny, jumpsuit-clad tunnel dwellers known as ""the Tethered"" descend upon the home of their well-to-do doppelgangers, the Wilsons. The husband, Gabe, (Winston Duke) offers the intruders his wallet, his car and his A.T.M. pin, though he notes they "" don't have anything "" of value at the house -- it's their summer lake house, he explains, and they just arrived that day. The Tethered placidly watch him bargain. With their sharp scissors and copycat faces , it's clear the bedraggled invaders aren't interested in cash. The writer-director Jordan Peele's latest nightmare is part of a long line of home-invasion movies like ""The Last House on the Left"" and ""Straw Dogs"" that tap into the fear that home may be where the danger is. When blood spills in a vacation house, however, that dread takes on an extra layer of meaning: Wealth becomes a signifier, leaving the haves vulnerable to opportunistic have-nots. If you are rich enough to use ""summer"" as a verb, someone will try to murder you. ""Us"" brings that class divide directly to the surface. In pitting a hard-working, rich black family against their downtrodden duplicates , Peele makes this tension complicated and explicit. As Gabe's fruitless offers show, summer homeowners don't die in horror movies because their killers are out for treasure. They die because their killers are out for them. But in similar movies like ""You're Next,"" the vacation-home invader's twisted reasoning is often muddled or only hinted at. In this 2011 indie, directed by Adam Wingard and written by Simon Barrett, the Final Girl, Erin ( Sharni Vinson ), faces off against a group of masked invaders in a vacation home belonging to her boyfriend Crispian's family. His parents are, in her words, ""pretty loaded.""

""You don't know what most people would give to have folks like yours,"" Erin tells Crispian (A.J. Bowen), before they fall asleep on a 100-year-old bed. But Crispian is dismissive of his privilege, a callousness that quickly turns toxic as the film reveals that he and his brother sent the masked killers to their own home to fast-track their inheritance. Unfortunately for them, Erin was raised on a survivalist commune in the Australian outback. She takes out the baddies with bludgeons and booby traps. Erin's sparse upbringing makes her uniquely capable of dismantling Crispian's scheme. Still, Crispian ultimately tries to win her over with money, promising her a vacation in Paris. Erin stabs him in the eye.

""Funny Games"" -- Michael Haneke's demented 1997 Austrian film and his shot-for-shot 2007 American remake -- is more open about playing with the notion that the victims' wealth makes them a target. The American version opens on a bird's-eye-view of our victims, the Farbers, playing ""guess the opera song"" in their giant S.U.V. They are driving to their summer home, sailboat in tow, for ""a week or two"" of relaxation. Their biggest conundrum is what to do with all of their extra steak, until two white-gloved sociopaths appear and bet them they'll be dead by 9 a.m. the next day. The family is slowly done in by objects that connote their relative wealth: a Callaway golf club, a hunting rifle, the sailboat. For all the abject physical violence in ""Funny Games,"" the psychological manipulation is altogether more horrifying . The menaces Paul and Peter (Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet) dance around their motivation for torturing the Farbers, manipulating audience sympathies by claiming they are underprivileged. ""The truth is, he's white trash,"" Paul claims, referring to Peter. ""He comes from a filthy, deprived family.""

In one of the film's many fourth-wall-breaking moments, Paul turns to the camera. ""You're on their side, aren't you?"" he asks. The taunt mocks viewers' complicity in what's happening onscreen -- you may sympathize with the Farbers, but you're also being entertained by their demise. ""Us"" doesn't dance around its intentions . It's at first easy to root for the Wilsons as underdogs: Peele sets up a dichotomy between the Wilsons' privilege and that of their white friends, Kitty (Elisabeth Moss) and Josh Tyler (Tim Heidecker). The Tylers languish in gadgets and plastic surgery, only surfacing from their alcoholic fugues long enough to snap at each other -- yet they are ostensibly better off, financially, than the Wilsons. Their car is nicer; they have a yacht instead of a motorboat. These subtle advantages get under Gabe's skin and serve as a running tension throughout the film as he tries unsuccessfully to match their material possessions. But the Wilsons' relationship to the Tethered -- an oppressed class of people taking down their more fortunate doubles -- complicates the audience's allegiance. When Red (Lupita Nyong'o) and her family invade the Wilson's home, she tells them a story: Red's double, Gabe's wife, Adelaide, is a girl who grows up eating delicious food, playing with cuddly toys and eventually marrying the man she loves. Her shadow -- Red herself -- eats ""rabbit, raw and bloody""; plays with toys so sharp that they cut her; and is forced into a loveless marriage. While Adelaide was able to have her second child via C-section, her shadow ""had to do it all herself."" Trapped in an underground, experimental cloning lab, Red and the other Tethered are the ultimate have-nots.

Though Peele has cited ""Funny Games"" as an influence on ""Us,"" he recognizes the cultural differences inherent in showcasing a vacation-home-owning black family facing off against their dystopian selves: Both the Farbers and the Wilsons are introduced through aerial shots of their cars, but rather than opera, the Wilsons arrive blasting Janelle Monae. (The song is ""I Like That,"" with lyrics that include the artist proudly proclaiming to be a ""walking contradiction,"" ""factual and fiction."") A cheerful painting of a black mother and daughter hangs in their vacation home. Gabe code-switches, deepening his voice to sound more intimidating, in order to try and scare the intruders away . The Tethered ultimately get in by using the spare key Adelaide has hidden under a rock, which Gabe calls ""white [expletive]"" -- the family's neighborhood comforts betray them.

By the third act, the film reveals that Adelaide was one of the Tethered who escaped and forced Red to take her place. At that point we have to ask ourselves: Who did the Wilsons have to step on to get where they are? For all the ease they signify, Adelaide's free time, vacation home and beach access actually make her anxious. She spends the first act of the movie on edge, overwhelmed by the gut feeling -- like a ""black cloud"" -- that her double is near. As a former member of the Tethered, Adelaide knows that her advantages make her a target in the impending class uprising. When the Tethered have their ""time up there,"" as Red calls it, those lucky enough to live in the sunshine will be the first to go.","In vacation-home-invasion horror movies like ""Funny Games"" and ""Us,"" privilege marks families for murder.",628e8c8b-f6e5-5760-ad34-720a1dbff472,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/29/arts/29summer-vacation4/29summer-vacation4-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=273c024776548a95c8540176090e4b239a44b1fc00f53122120df913384a25ca&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Wilson family is forced to face their disadvantaged doppelgängers in ""Us.""

Movies,Eddie Murphy Will Star in 'Beverly Hills Cop 4' for Netflix,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/movies/eddie-murphy-beverly-hills-cop-4-netflix.html,"Netflix is doubling down on the Eddie Murphy business.

The streaming giant behind ""Dolomite Is My Name,"" Murphy's acclaimed return to movies, will produce and release on its service a new installment in the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" franchise, as part of a licensing deal with Paramount Pictures. The comedian will star and Jerry Bruckheimer will return to produce. Netflix also has the rights to produce a potential second film.

Viacom, the parent company of Paramount, announced the news during its fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday. Netflix declined to comment.

The agreement is part of Paramount Pictures' continuing partnership with Netflix. The two entities joined forces soon after Jim Gianopulos became chief executive of Paramount in 2017. The studio supplied the streaming giant with ""13 Reasons Why"" and ""Maniac,"" among other series. The two companies also collaborated to debut ""The Cloverfield Paradox"" on Netflix in a marketing stunt following the 2018 Super Bowl. Paramount similarly unloaded the horror film ""Eli"" to the streaming service in addition to the international rollout of the sci-fi drama ""Annihilation.""

The announcement follows Viacom's news Wednesday that its Nickelodeon division will create and produce original animated feature films and television series based on its stable of beloved properties, including ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" and ""The Loud House"" for Netflix.

Science,Ancient Viruses Are Buried in Your DNA,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/science/ancient-viruses-dna-genome.html,"A human embryo at 45 days. Scientists have learned that a protein called Hemo, made by a fetus and the placenta, is produced from viral DNA that entered our ancestors' genomes 100 million years ago.

In July, scientists reported that a strange protein courses through the veins of pregnant women. No one is sure what it's there for. What makes this protein, called Hemo, so unusual is that it's not made by the mother. Instead, it is made in her fetus and in the placenta, by a gene that originally came from a virus that infected our mammalian ancestors more than 100 million years ago. Hemo is not the only protein with such an alien origin: Our DNA contains roughly 100,000 pieces of viral DNA. Altogether, they make up about 8 percent of the human genome. And scientists are only starting to figure out what this viral DNA is doing to us. Aris Katzourakis, a virologist at the University of Oxford, and his colleagues recently published a commentary in the journal Trends in Microbiology in which they explored the possibility that viral genes that produce proteins like Hemo are affecting our health in a variety of unexpected ways.

Some of our ancient viruses may be protecting us from disease; others may be raising our risks for cancer, among other conditions. ""It's not an either-or -- are these things good or bad? It's a lot more complicated than that,"" Dr. Katzourakis said in an interview. ""We're barely at the beginning of this research."" Most of our viral DNA comes from one group in particular: retroviruses, a group that includes HIV. A retrovirus invades a host cell and inserts its genes into that cell's DNA. These viral genes co-opt the cell's machinery, using it to make new viruses that escape to infect more cells. If a retrovirus happens to infect an egg or sperm, its DNA can potentially be passed to the next generation and the generation after that. Once retroviruses become inherited stowaways, scientists refer to them as endogenous retroviruses. At first, endogenous retroviruses coax cells to make more retroviruses that can infect other cells. But over the generations, the viral DNA mutates, and endogenous retroviruses eventually lose the ability to infect new cells. Even after being hobbled, these endogenous retroviruses can still sometimes make their proteins. And they can also reproduce, after a fashion. They can force cells to make copies of their DNA, which are inserted back in the cell's own genome.

After a single infection, an endogenous retrovirus may build up hundreds of copies of itself in its host's DNA. Some endogenous retroviruses are unique to humans, but others are found in a variety of species. In January, Dr. Katzourakis was a co-author on a study showing that one retrovirus common in mammals also is present in fish like cod and tuna. Retroviruses, that study indicated, were invading our marine ancestors 450 million years ago -- or even earlier. Just as we have defenses against free-living viruses, we have also developed defenses against endogenous retroviruses. Our cells can coat their DNA with molecules that suppress viral genes, for example. But sometimes these viral genes manage to switch on anyway. In many kinds of tumor cells, for instance, scientists find proteins produced by endogenous retroviruses. That discovery has fueled a long-running debate: Do endogenous retroviruses help cause cancer? Recent studies suggest they can. A team of French researchers engineered healthy human cells to make a viral protein found in many tumors and watched the cells grow in a petri dish. The protein caused the cells to behave in some suspiciously cancer-like ways. They changed shape, as cancer cells do, becoming long and skinny. And they also started to move across the dish. In addition, the viral protein caused the cells to switch on other genes that have been linked to cancer.

But John M. Coffin, a virologist at Tufts University, suspects there's less to these viral proteins than meets the eyes. He speculates that in many cases, cancer cells make viral proteins only because they are switching on genes willy-nilly -- both human and viral genes alike. ""Our starting position is that this is largely a chance event,"" Dr. Coffin said. But in certain cases, Dr. Coffin said, we have domesticated our viruses. We make proteins from endogenous retroviruses to carry out functions we depend on. Some endogenous retroviruses offer protection against other viruses, for example. And some viral proteins are important for reproduction. Placentas make viral proteins, and scientists have found that some types, known as syncytins, fuse together placental cells, a crucial step in fetal development. ""My speculation is that without syncytins, mammal evolution would have looked very different,"" Dr. Coffin said. Five years ago, the French biologist Odile Heidmann and her colleagues went on a search for more endogenous retroviruses in the human genome. Dr. Heidmann, who works at Gustave Roussy, a cancer research institute in Paris, discovered a stretch of viral DNA that had gone overlooked. She and her colleagues named it Hemo. Dr. Heidmann was surprised to find versions of Hemo in other species. Among primates, the gene that makes this protein has barely changed over the ages.

Its consistency across many species shows that the gene and its protein must have an important job to do: ""It isn't simply a relic,"" Dr. Heidmann said. Mutations to Hemo must have been harmful or even fatal to the unfortunate animals who had them. The placenta produces Hemo, and so do cells in the early embryo itself. But so far Dr. Heidmann and her colleagues have not been able to figure out why. ""It's very, very old, so it has to do something,"" she said. It's possible, she said, that Hemo proteins are a message from fetus to mother, dampening the mother's immune system so that it doesn't attack the fetus. But there are other possibilities, too. The early embryo is a hotbed of activity for endogenous retroviruses, recent studies have shown. To understand why embryonic cells make viral proteins, scientists have run experiments to see what happens when viral genes are silenced. These experiments suggest that viral proteins help the embryo develop a variety of tissues. Early on, the cells in an embryo can turn into any tissue. As these stem cells divide, they can lose this flexibility, committing to becoming one kind of cell or another. After that, cells typically shut down their viral genes. Viral proteins appear to help keep stem cells from losing this potential. And Gkikas Magiorkinis of the University of Athens has speculated that this feature might have a sinister origin. Viruses might have exploited embryos to make more copies of themselves. By keeping their hosts as stem cells for longer, the viruses were able to invade more parts of the embryo's body.

""When the host grows, it will have copies in the retrovirus in most of its cells,"" Dr. Magiorkinis said. This strategy may do more than create more viruses. Stem cells can produce eggs and sperm in embryos. The viruses may be raising their odds of getting into the next generation. In other words, early embryos may have come to depend on the tricks viruses use to manipulate them. ""We're exploiting a property that has evolved for the virus's benefit,"" Dr. Katzourakis said.",Endogenous retroviruses wormed into the human genome eons ago. Today viral genes continue to produce a variety of mysterious proteins in the body.,ee362f4c-1c00-554b-8c4b-1a0e5a26b8b7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/10/science/10SCI-ZIMMER/10SCI-ZIMMER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=aa11fb0619f441e7db36cecd3df8cd7080ab7d65ae0748cd885ab65f4f5ae52e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A human embryo at 45 days.

Automobiles,What Self-Driving Cars See,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/automobiles/wheels/lidar-self-driving-cars.html,"Giant tech companies are fighting over the technology in court. Start-ups around the world are racing to develop new versions of it. And engineers say it is essential to making autonomous cars safe. ""We believe it will be the basis for autonomous driving,"" said Guillaume Devauchelle, who oversees innovation at Valeo, a major parts supplier to automakers. The technology, which uses near-infrared light to detect the shape of objects around it, is the centerpiece of an intense court fight in California between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving business operated by Google's parent, Alphabet. In the case, Waymo accuses a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski, of stealing trade secrets about the company's lidar designs for his own autonomous driving start-up -- which he sold to Uber for nearly $700 million.

Lidar -- pronounced LIE-dar -- is shorthand for light detection and ranging. It is a type of sensor that is at the heart of many autonomous car designs and is critical to several worldwide high-resolution mapping efforts. The same technology is used to delineate terrain from airplanes and detect speeding violations. A lidar sensor from Luminar. The technology uses near-infrared light to detect the shape of objects around it. The advantage of lidar is that it can generate precise three-dimensional images of everything from cars to trees to cyclists in a variety of environments and under a variety of lighting conditions. While autonomous car designs use numerous sensors, including ultrasonic, radar and video camera components, lidar has unique abilities. Unlike cameras, for example, lidar cannot be fooled by shadows or blinded by bright sunlight. The biggest hurdle to widespread lidar adoption is an economic one, and that is where the battle is being waged. When Google initially started its autonomous vehicle research eight years ago, the lidar sensors it used cost roughly $75,000. Those sensors were made by Velodyne Lidar, an industry leader. Velodyne declined to say what the current pricing is for such systems, but Waymo's chief executive, John Krafcik, said in a recent presentation that his company had reduced the cost of its lidar system by 90 percent. But even at $7,500, such systems are seen as too expensive to meet automakers' demands. ""Car companies want it to cost $100 and perform 10 times better, be smaller -- and very reliable,"" said Omer Keilaf, chief executive of Innoviz Technologies, a lidar developer based in Israel. ""So there's a big vacuum in the industry right now.""

The race to fill that void is largely focused on producing solid-state lidar systems, which would shrink the size of the sensors, eliminate moving parts involved in the optical mechanisms and enable the kind of mass manufacturing that could bring costs down, said Hongbo Zhang, a research associate at Virginia Tech who is working on a lidar design. Established automotive suppliers, such as Velodyne and Valeo; technology companies like Waymo and Uber; and relative newcomers like Innoviz, LeddarTech and Quanergy all have their sights set on making less expensive sensors.

Solid-state lidars tend to have a reduced field of view, about 120 degrees compared with the 360-degree view offered by rooftop models. ""So to create a cocoon around the car, you need to integrate four to six solid-state lidar sensors,"" said Marc A. Morin, a spokesman for LeddarTech. But most of the researchers working on these designs still believe they can produce them for much lower prices, and Hyundai has demonstrated in its Ioniq autonomous test cars how such sensors could be made less conspicuous and concealed in the bumpers and roof pillars of vehicles. Luminar Technologies, a lidar company that recently came out of stealth mode, is focusing on improving the performance of sensors by extending the effective range of lidar past 200 meters. (Top-of-the-line sensors now have a range of 120 meters.) Austin Russell, Luminar's chief executive, said the company accomplished the longer range by using a more sensitive receiver, as well as a more powerful light output that remains safe enough to avoid damaging people's vision. Velodyne, which says it is the only current third-party lidar supplier for fully autonomous vehicles now being tested, is well aware that start-ups are gunning for its business. Velodyne is working on its own solid-state Velarray lidar sensor, said Mike Jellen, Velodyne president, and it plans to start mass-producing them next year in a 200,000-square-foot factory in San Jose, Calif. While there has been considerable speculation about how Velodyne will face the potential price competition, Mr. Jellen declined to estimate how much the new sensors might cost, saying only that a complete lidar sensor package for future vehicles might be priced in the ""low thousands"" per vehicle.

""In five years, for ride-sharing cars, it could be an $8,000"" option, said Jeffrey Owens, chief technology officer for Delphi. Delphi recently announced it was working with Intel, BMW and Mobileye on an autonomous driving platform. ""In 2025, it could be $5,000,"" he said. ""The problem is that we're still in A.I. learning mode and only buying in quantities of a couple thousand,"" said Velodyne's Jellen, referring to artificial intelligence. ""The problem is, the market isn't there yet."" There are also some technical kinks that need to be ironed out with new systems. Different versions of lidar paint images of the world around them in different ways, said Mr. Zhang at Virginia Tech. That means different lidar sensors from different companies cannot simply be exchanged for one another on an autonomous BMW or Ford vehicle. How a car is trained and learns will partly depend on the specific type of lidar used. In spite of these challenges, Mr. Keilaf of Innoviz and many others say there will not be fully autonomous cars without lidar -- and it will have to be cheap. It will also have to meet exceptionally high standards. ""An autonomous vehicle that's 99 percent safe won't be good enough,"" said Mr. Russell of Luminar. ""This is mission critical. You can't afford to miss a single object because that object could be a person.""","Lidar, the sensing technology, is the centerpiece of an intense court fight in California between two key players on the road, Uber and Waymo.",972ed679-4459-5637-a571-f82952b089e3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/26/business/26wheels-top/26wheels-top-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=a55a5176efb9f37581bc3d999d6ee91719fe1ab4882d3df1080dff826bbd6856&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Raw data captured from a Luminar sensor while driving along San Francisco's Embarcadero.,972ed679-4459-5637-a571-f82952b089e3,N24News/imgs/972ed679-4459-5637-a571-f82952b089e3.jpg,23
Real Estate,Where Blue Meets Green: Sustainable Waterfront Homes,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/realestate/sustainable-green-waterfront-homes.html,"Waterfront living brings one closer to the healing blue of oceans, lakes and rivers. But what about helping to actually heal the earth? Experts say interest in waterfront green living may be on the rise. ""Based on my experience and in talking to other realtors, homeowners today who are buying a primary or vacation home by the water are paying more attention to sustainability,"" said Seth Tilton, a realtor for ERA Evergreen Real Estate Company in Hilton Head, S.C., and a certified expert in sustainable real estate. ""There is a lot more awareness about overall wellness than ever before and green living is a part of that."" Most of these buyers gravitate to recently built homes, Mr. Tilton said, because they're more likely to be eco-friendly than older ones. ""A property that's 20 or 30 years old doesn't usually incorporate sustainability, unless it has been extensively renovated, because there wasn't as much awareness on the topic back then,"" he said. Features of a green home may include solar panels that supply heat and air conditioning, energy efficient appliances, LED lighting, and insulated windows and walls that minimize energy use. Waterfront homes might also include recycled shells or colorful tiles as part of the construction adding an eco-friendly warmth and sense of place.

About 35 minutes by car from Savannah, Ga., this home is part of Palmetto Bluff, a 20,000-acre coastal community and nature conserve with a focus on sustainability and environmental education. In 2003, the owners established the Palmetto Bluff Conservancy, a nonprofit that protects the diverse ecosystem of wetlands, forests and wildlife like white-tailed deer, wild turkeys and gray foxes. Once the project is complete, more than half of the community's land will be in a conservation easement never to be developed. Every Palmetto Bluff home has eco-friendly features and amenities including ample green spaces and footpaths; multiple fitness centers, restaurants, a dog park and spa; and more than a dozen land and water activities such as fishing, sporting clays and boating. The Home The home, with five bedrooms and baths and two half baths, is in Palmetto Bluff's River Road neighborhood, characteristic for its classic residences and adjacent to a 120-acre preserve. It's light and bright with a white color theme and overlooks the inland waterway. The entry-level includes a sprawling living room with high ceilings, an open kitchen, a second back kitchen and the master suite. An additional three bedrooms are on the second floor while a fourth bedroom, with a sitting area and kitchenette, is above the three-car garage. Sustainable features include energy-efficient appliances and heating system, green construction and paving materials and insulation that's designed to minimize the use of heat and air conditioning.

This home, called Villa Laterite, is in Sasawane, a coastal village in Alibag, a three-hour drive south of Mumbai. It was built in 2018 and sits just over 600 feet away from the sea. The area, a popular second home and vacation spot for Mumbai residents, is known for its scenic beaches; excellent, inexpensive seafood; and cultural sites such as historic Kolaba Fort. The Home Spanning three levels, the villa has three bedrooms and baths and a contemporary Indian aesthetic of dark Burmese teak woods mixed with gold finishes and colorful patterned tiles. High ceilings and natural light are a feature throughout. A large living and dining room, kitchen and bedroom are on the entry-level while the floor above has two more bedrooms and a family room. The third level has an uncovered tiled terrace. Villa Laterite has solar water heaters and LED lights, and a generator on hand as a power backup. Three wells, along with a rainwater harvesting system, supply the home with water. Outdoor Space The home is built on more than an acre of land and the property is lush with native trees including mango, lemon, papaya and guava. It also has spacious lawn, a produce garden, a lap pool and multiple decks.

This apartment, in an upscale seaside resort development in Andalusia, on Spain's southeast coast, is part of a residential community that's scheduled to be completed in November. Located in the heart of Sotogrande's vibrant marina, the community consists of two buildings, one with eight apartments and the other with 56; this property is in the latter. All residences have electric heaters that supply hot water using thermal solar energy, energy-efficient appliances, LED lighting, and walls and roofing with thermal insulation that cut down on the use of heat and air conditioning. Amenities within the community include a pool and multiple green areas with native plants. The beach, five golf courses and activities such as horseback riding, tennis and sailing are a short walk away. The Home The apartment, which includes two bedrooms and two baths, has an airy feel and contemporary style that includes light wood finishes. The kitchen is long and narrow and opens to the living and dining area as well as a hallway leading to the two bedrooms and baths. The master bathroom has two sinks, and both baths have large showers. Outdoor Space There's a spacious terrace off the living room with unobstructed views of the marina and the Mediterranean Sea. The terrace can also be accessed from the master bedroom.

This three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath home is in the coastal Los Angeles neighborhood of Marina del Rey, known for its namesake harbor and vibrant seaside restaurants. The property is a block from the harbor in one of the few areas close to the water that has single-family homes; direct waterfront properties in Marina del Rey are mostly apartments and condominiums. The Home Split into three levels, the home has a dramatic entryway with a glass wall and two-story ceiling. Common spaces including the kitchen and living and dining rooms are on the entry floor, while the bedrooms are on the second level and a spacious covered roof garden is on the third.

Art & Design,This House Throws the Hamptons a Curve,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/arts/design/cocoon-house-hamptons-leed.html,"Lukas Anker leaping across the combination cistern-reflecting pool, which cools the air and irrigates the lawn. Credit...Tony Cenicola/The New York Times



When Nina Edwards Anker was growing up, her family spent summers and weekends in a shingled cottage in Southampton, N.Y. An expansion of a carriage house originally designed in 1890 by Stanford White , it belonged to a genre typical of the Hamptons. But the version that Ms. Anker -- the 48-year-old founder of the Brooklyn design company Nea studio -- designed for herself; her husband, Peder Anker , a history of science professor at New York University ; and their two sons is anything but common. Located on the same property as her childhood cottage (which her brother now occupies), Cocoon House is a LEED-certified example of sustainable design that strays from many of the local norms.

For one thing, there's its size: at 1,730 square feet, Cocoon House, which is named for its rounded, sheltering cedar-shingled walls, is smaller than some Hamptons pool houses, and it has no second story, wraparound porch or dormer windows. But small is beautiful when you're aiming for energy efficiency.

In addition to running her studio, Ms. Anker is the design director of Terreform ONE , an eco-focused architectural think tank that designed an urban habitat for at-risk monarch butterflies now on display at the Cooper Hewitt Triennial. ""I realized that we have no choice but to engage with the crisis happening around us,"" she said. Cocoon House proves that sustainable design doesn't preclude gracious proportions, generous daylight or elegant interiors.

You enter on the shingled north side, into a living-dining-kitchen space with curved white walls and ceilings that facilitate air circulation and soften sound. (The 16-foot-high interiors give even the smallest rooms, like the sons' bedrooms, a lofty feeling.) The furnishings are a mixture of CB2 and Ms. Anker's own creations -- including an origami-like wicker settee and matching chairs, and a sofa whose cushion is filled with dried lentils.

The house is actually L-shaped. On the north and west sides, its rounded, thick and heavily insulated walls retain heat and provide privacy, while on the south and east sides, 65 feet of continuous sliding glass doors, topped by skylights, admit ocean breezes and provide views to the water and trees. Through the south-facing glass, the sun warms the house in winter, while interior shades and curtains reduce the heat gain in summer by half.

The house, Ms. Anker, said, is ""half closed and half open, half curved and half crystalline."" Environmental regulations required it to be located at a 150-foot radius from nearby wetlands, and the house (which has a crawl space, but no basement) is raised a couple of feet above the wet zone. Its structure is made entirely of timber, which has a smaller carbon footprint than steel. A combination cistern-reflecting pool wraps around the east and south sides, projecting sunlight into the interior during the day and creating a mirror effect at dusk, while it also scores LEED points by cooling the air and irrigating the surrounding lawn. Glass panels in the skylights, with tints were inspired by Goethe's theories on color, are red and orange in the master bedroom (to promote rest), and yellow in the living area (to encourage activity). A triangular skylight in the master bedroom ""is like a solar clock,"" Ms. Anker said, tracing the sun's path along the room's white walls.

Everything in the design is geared toward maximum efficiency. Closed-cell foam insulation in the shingled walls combats the humidity that creates a moldy smell in many beach houses, and the doors and windows are passive-house certified. The energy-recovery ventilation system -- ""You have to ventilate from the outside, not just the inside,"" Ms. Anker emphasized -- runs on electricity, using no oil or gas, and heating is necessary only on winter nights, or on days that are cold and cloudy. (The fireplace is also energy efficient.) Photovoltaic panels on the nearby garage generate more electricity than the house needs from April through October. Ms. Anker said the building's size and shape -- it has far fewer corners than most houses -- cut about 15 to 20 percent on materials and costs. Prefabricated trusses saved construction time (and therefore expense), and computer modeling controlled the shaping of materials, reducing waste. When asked what she likes best about living there, she described the different ways the sun enters with each season. The house, she said, ""is like a cinema for moving shadows.""","Designed for maximum energy efficiency, a weekend home looks nothing like the neighbors'.

Opinion,Religious Exemption From Florida's Stay-at-Home Order,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/opinion/letters/coronavirus-florida.html,"Gail Collins suggests that Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida will be remembered for allowing partygoers on the beach during spring break. The full story has yet to be written. His stay-at-home order on Wednesday was not only too late, but also carved a big exception for churches and synagogues right before Easter and Passover. Wait for the community spread!

Re ""The Ventilators Were on Order. They Still Are"" (front page, March 30): What a heartbreaking story, exposing tragic errors caused by the fundamental weakness in our national health care system. And today we are still making the same mistake. The states and the federal government are in a bidding war for the old-style, expensive, difficult-to-operate ventilators. The invocation of the Defense Production Act is a step forward, but the contracted automakers may not start providing this vital equipment until late April. By then, many thousands will have died unnecessarily.

There is good reason to believe that we can speedily produce simple-to-operate, much less expensive ventilators. A volunteer team at M.I.T. is on the verge of releasing an open-source prototype. A team at Oxford University already has a working prototype. Why are our leaders not supporting or even mentioning these efforts? Where is the roadblock? It seems that just as before, as this article so clearly shows, passivity overrides foresight and profits are paramount.

""I Love the World, but I Cannot Stay,"" by Mary Pipher (Sunday Review, March 8), captures a sentiment that many of us older people try to articulate to our families and friends. How do I want to deal with death and what should I expect when I die? It makes me wonder why more people don't want to make efforts to manage their death in a way that supports their beliefs. I suspect that some people will be discussing this as they deal with the Covid-19 virus and all of its unknowns. I, for one, want to live as long as I can without severe suffering or a significant loss of autonomy. I don't want doctors to tell me when I should die, and I don't want to waste a lot of money trying to live for a few more months.

Education,"Schools Offering Drone Programs, but Learning to Fly Is Just the Start",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/education/learning/schools-drone-programs.html,"At a Girls in Aviation Day event in Manhattan, a drone pilot, Loretta Alkalay, commanded the attention of everyone in the audience as she launched a quad copter into the air and held it in a hover. The students, ages 12 to 17, looked eager to give it a try. And that is the point. Ms. Alkalay, a lawyer and an instructor in drone law at Vaughn College of Aeronautics and Technology in East Elmhurst, Queens, is one of a growing number of educators enthusiastic about the way drones make new technology accessible, encouraging students to study subjects they might otherwise not consider. ""From programming, software coding, 3-D printing, it's limitless,"" Ms. Alkalay said. ""Everything you do with computers and airplanes or helicopters, you can do with drones."" Whether for their potential role in education, entertainment or commercial use, drones (also called unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs) have captured the world's attention. Global sales have more than tripled from three million in 2014 to an estimated 10 million this year, according to statistics from Business Insider Intelligence, a private research company. Over a third of the purchases are in the United States.

Colleges have noted this interest, and an increasing number are offering drone classes. Vaughn started an introductory course and the one on law taught by Ms. Alkalay, who formerly led a regional legal office for the Federal Aviation Administration. Five more classes are being planned. At least a half-dozen other colleges, including the aviation behemoth Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, as well as Kansas State University, the University of North Dakota and Lewis University in Illinois, have gone all in, by offering degrees in drones. And 23 schools in the United States, Canada and Britain have partnered with the F.A.A. to carry out drone-based research programs. ""It feels like the beginning of aviation all over again,"" said Maxine Lubner, a professor of management at Vaughn.

""I thought it was pretty cool,"" said Mr. Espinoza, who is from Mexicali. With a fellow student, Alfredo Martinez, the two set out to build and fly a drone in a national competition. A propeller broke during their first race. A year later, they placed third in a field of six. By objective standards, they did not do well, but that is not how Mr. Espinoza views his experience. ""With drones, you apply a lot of things -- not just programming and electronics, but mechanics and applying thermal energy,"" he said. ""You can revolutionize the drones and use them for other things, like research."" While Cetys has a reputation for turning out graduates ready for jobs in industrial and mechanical engineering, the drone courses prepare them for positions with new titles, like innovation engineer and new prototypes designer, said Luis Carlos Basaca, a program coordinator at Cetys School of Engineering. ""Working with drones makes our students use all their creativity because they have to think out of the box,"" Mr. Basaca said. ""They have to think, 'Which material can make this lighter, more resilient? Which type of motors should I use?'"" he added. ""These types of questions are very complex. If one, two or three students can build a drone by themselves, they are using their brains to the maximum."" Other educators who use drones in the classroom say Mr. Espinoza's hit-and-miss experience is not only typical, but also beneficial. ""It's about not being afraid to fail,"" said Steven Cohen, a teacher at the Applied Technology High School in Bergen County, N.J. ""Students say, 'We didn't do it right, darn.' But I say, 'It's great that you didn't do it right, because now you learned from doing it wrong.'"" It is difficult to quantify how many schools are using drones in the classroom, although the number is on the increase and more students are demanding these classes, according to Ms. Lubner of Vaughn. Like Cetys, Vaughn offers drone classes that are incorporated into other majors.

""For years we were kneecapped by the F.A.A.'s unwillingness to do anything except regulate [drones] out of business,"" said Patrick Sherman, a drone pilot and industry consultant in Oregon. ""The F.A.A. has made big strides"" and that's good, he said, because the United States has ""a more complex airspace system than anyone else."" Still, the limitations have been challenging for drone programs. ""If you go outside in a place like New York City it's impossible to find a place to legally fly,"" Ms. Alkalay said. If students ""fly in a park and it's not approved, they're subject to being hassled or arrested or worse.""
