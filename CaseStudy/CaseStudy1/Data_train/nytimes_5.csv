Health,Nearly 20 Million Have Gained Health Insurance Since 2010,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/health/obamacare-health-insurance-numbers-nchs.html,"Young people were more likely to be uninsured than their elders, the N.C.H.S. found. Almost 17 percent of adults aged 25 to 34 lacked insurance, while less than 9 percent of those aged 45 to 64 were uninsured.

The lead author of the report, Robin A. Cohen, a statistician at the N.C.H.S., pointed out that high-deductible health plans have become more popular. In 2010, 25.3 percent of the insured under the age of 65 had high-deductible plans. By 2016, nearly 40 percent had them.

From 2010 to 2016, rates of the uninsured declined in all age groups, down 14.4 percent among those aged 18 to 24, 16.5 percent among those aged 25 to 34, 13.7 percent among those aged 35 to 44, and down 8.9 percent in the 45-to-64 age group.

While rates of the uninsured declined sharply among the poor over those years, 26.2 percent of the near-poor (those with an income of 100 to 200 percent of the federal poverty level) and 23.2 percent of the poor (an income of less than 100 percent of the poverty level) lacked health insurance.

There were stark differences by race and ethnicity. While 25 percent of Hispanics were uninsured in 2016, 15 percent of African-Americans, 8.6 percent of whites and 7.5 percent of Asians lacked health insurance.",The number of Americans without health insurance has fallen drastically since passage of the Affordable Care Act.,b5ffa13e-40f8-5280-b292-d93c56bbe836,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/23/science/23SCI-NUMBERwebSUB/23SCI-NUMBERwebSUB-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=684c58ea6c0137064bcfdc99ce856b878bcc20480bd7f30937b38e07019a3b65&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Customers at a mall kiosk of Sunshine Health and Life Advisors, a company that helps with enrollment in the Affordable Care Act, in Miami last November.",b5ffa13e-40f8-5280-b292-d93c56bbe836,N24News/imgs/b5ffa13e-40f8-5280-b292-d93c56bbe836.jpg,1
Media,Verizon and Hearst to Create TV for Mobile Millennial Viewers,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/03/business/media/verizon-and-hearst-to-create-tv-for-mobile-millennial-viewers.html,"Seeking to entertain the elusive millennial, Verizon Communications and Hearst announced on Wednesday the formation of a joint venture to develop programming for young adults to watch on their phones.

Called Verizon Hearst Media Partners, the enterprise will kick off this spring with two channels: RatedRed.com, aimed at ""millennials from the heartland,"" with programming about music, food, outdoors, politics, military and faith, and Seriously.TV, offering a comedic take on current events at the speed of breaking news. Other networks are planned.

The programming is intended for viewers to watch on mobile devices and will be available via Verizon's Go90 streaming service and also on computers and TV.

The partnership brings together the technical know-how of Verizon, the telecommunications company that has been expanding into entertainment and advertising technology with the start of Go90 and recent acquisition of AOL, and the expertise of Hearst, the traditional media company that has made a number of investments in digital outlets. Hearst owns stakes in the cable TV networks ESPN and A&E, publishes the magazines Cosmopolitan, Elle and Esquire and also has invested in digital brands including Buzzfeed, Vice and AwesomenessTV.","The companies will offer streaming channels for mobile devices, beginning with a comedy channel and one for ""millennials in the heartland.""",b69e0517-d58d-5820-9204-28d5487e896e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/03/business/03verizon/03verizon-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=365&w=698&s=9ae2bff12a48179b6fb0ae331759757378637f03d5b97149fbbbce83a571d3fa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Hearst, a traditional media company, has invested in a number of digital outlets, including AwesomenessTV, one of whose popular shows is ""Guidance,"" starring Amanda Steele.",b69e0517-d58d-5820-9204-28d5487e896e,N24News/imgs/b69e0517-d58d-5820-9204-28d5487e896e.jpg,16
Sports,"Running Blind, and Running Free",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/22/sports/blind-runner-marathon-technology.html,"Thomas Panek dreamed for years of running the way he did before he lost his sight, without fear and without a human or a dog tethered to his wrist as a guide. That dream took Panek, 50, to the north end of Central Park one frigid morning last month, to test drive something that might one day liberate thousands of other people with severely impaired vision. As a camera crew and a team of technologists made some final adjustments, he stood on the downslope of West Drive. He straddled a painted yellow line and waited for the signal to go. A little more than a year had passed since Panek delivered a challenge to a group of engineers at Google's Manhattan offices during a company hackathon. Could they develop a way for him to run by himself, with a clear sense of where he was going and without having to worry about hazards along the way? There had been other attempts to find technological solutions to this problem, but none of them completely untethered runners from their guides. Panek has retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic condition that causes the loss of photoreceptor cells. As a child, he lost the ability to see stars in the night sky. He was legally blind by young adulthood.

To run blind, Panek said, is to always fear that you are about to slam your face into a tree. Panek, who lives in Westchester County, just north of New York City, loves to run with his guide dog, Blaze. But Blaze can't run faster than about a nine-minute mile. ""I'm a little faster than that,"" said Panek, who completed the 2015 Boston Marathon in 3 hours 42 minutes, with Scott Jurek, an ultramarathoner, guiding him. That translates to about an eight-and-half-minute mile for the marathon, though Panek can go faster at shorter distances. By the end of that one-day hackathon last year, the engineers had sketched a basic idea of a solution. They placed a line of masking tape on the floor and had Panek and his dog follow the line. Then the mission became devising an app that worked the same way as the dog, and, in the process, perhaps solving a problem for Panek and a lot of other people. ""If you start with one person and their challenges, you can bring a great benefit for him and also people like him,"" said Ryan Burke, a leader at the Google Creative Lab.

The National Federation of the Blind estimates that 7.6 million people in the United States have a visual impairment that requires them to use alternate means to engage in an activity that people with vision can do without assistance. The United States Association of Blind Athletes, which holds camps and regional competitions for people who are blind or visually impaired, has more than 700 members who could benefit from the technology Panek requested. Panek is chief executive of Guiding Eyes for the Blind, which provides guide dogs to people with severe vision loss. Three years ago, the organization began a program to train dogs as running guides, and since then has provided dogs to 75 runners. In a typical year, more than 50 blind runners complete the California International Marathon with guides; 53 runners who identified themselves as having a vision impairment finished the New York City Marathon in 2019. Many others ran shorter races. Dror Ayalon, a creative technologist on the project inspired by Panek's challenge, said a plan became clear fairly quickly. A crew would paint a yellow line for Panek to follow throughout a race. He would strap a phone with a camera and the newly devised app to his midsection, and the camera would track the yellow line on the ground. The app would take information from the camera and convey vibrating signals through a headset. As Panek ran, the signals would tell him how to adjust his steps to stay on the line. Signals in the right ear meant he was wandering too far to his right, and vice versa. Another signal would help him navigate a turn when the camera spotted the line curving. Software programs used for video game design helped the app learn to interpret the images from the camera. The work became more complicated when engineers began to consider all the things that might interfere with tracking a line on pavement that a runner would be trying to follow while carrying a phone.

The camera was going to shake constantly. The sunlight would change, making a yellow line look different at noon from the way it did at dawn. And what would happen when leaves blew onto the line, covering a part of it? Would the app interpret that break in the line as a parked car, and signal the runner to stop? ""We take examples and feed them into the model, classifying the pixels as one class and everything else as not in the class,"" Ayalon said, referring to obstacles that might block the view of the line. ""The model learns over time."" So does the runner. Panek tested the technology for months over short distances, slowly gaining confidence, learning to trust the directional messages in his ears. Then, in November, it was time for a 5-kilometer run. ""Liberation is a huge motivation,"" he said, ""the idea of being self-reliant."" Working with New York Road Runners, the organizer of the New York City Marathon, technologists received permission to paint their yellow line around the north loop of Central Park, a 1.42-mile circle that includes the climb known as Harlem Hill. Despite the cold, Panek wore short sleeves. He has the wiry build of a veteran runner. The only hint of his sight loss is that his eyes sometimes appear to focus in different directions. But he adeptly compensates, following a voice and picking up on people's unique sounds, looking toward them as he talks. As noon approached, he was ready to run. ""Let's go,"" he said when it was time. A starter told him to go, and he was off. He sprinted downhill toward his first turn as though he knew where he was headed. And then, about a minute in, the voice in Panek's headset -- as well as everyone around him -- told him to stop. A car from the Parks and Recreation Department was parked on the line.

And off he went. Except for a few stutter steps as he rounded the first corners, he pounded the line with confidence, rarely drifting more than a few inches from it on either side. For the first time in decades, Panek was running the way he did as a child. He crossed the finish line. An official from the running organization draped a medal around his neck. ""Perfect,"" Panek said of the run. ""It was just perfect."" It's unclear where the technology goes from here. Engineers still have some kinks to work out. It would help if the app could navigate around a parked car. But once it can, park officials anywhere might be persuaded to paint yellow lines marking loops for blind runners on routes that are free of cars, allowing them to run freely and safely. Perhaps one day, after the app can learn how to follow a yellow line that is partly covered by discarded paper cups, blind runners may be able to run an official 5K, or even a marathon. ""There's that blue line on the New York City Marathon route,"" Panek said, referring to the race's signature marking of the 26.2-mile route. ""Maybe one day we'll be able to get our own yellow line, too.""",A blind runner issued a challenge to technologists last year to find a way for him to run safely without a guide.

Art & Design,Sam Gilliam Unfurls an Exuberant Rainbow at Dia:Beacon,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/arts/design/sam-gilliam-dia-beacon-color-.html,"BEACON, N.Y. -- Sam Gilliam, an abstract painter of 85, proves that optical prettiness can have depth. A longtime resident of Washington, he is loosely associated with color-field painting, which once turned our nation's capital into a capital of contemporary art. There is no easy way to explain how a city whose architecture and statuary can seem consistently colorless became, in the '60s, the locus of an art ""ism"" that spewed bright color in every direction. This was the movement that, following the lead of Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland, endowed painting with the casual radiance of watercolor. Mr. Gilliam, too, soaked and stained unprimed canvas with pools of thinned-down acrylic pigment. It mattered at the time, at least to theory-inclined critics, that the paint merged with the weave of the canvas rather than sitting in clumps on top of it. A soaked canvas is likely to be at least half-an-inch flatter than a brushstroke-laden one, a distinction that helped spawn the now-historic Cult of Flatness. It was led by the critic Clement Greenberg, who believed that modern art lived its best life when it proclaimed the inherent limitations of its medium. Color-field painting, which produced some bona fide masterworks and more than its share of decorative fluff, fell into eclipse in the last quarter of the 20th century. But Mr. Gilliam's early efforts have sprung into view again, and one hopes they remain vividly present. It's heartening to report that art-world fashion is now beginning to favor once-overlooked abstract paintings by major African-American artists, who include, besides Mr. Gilliam, Ed Clark (whose first show at Hauser & Wirth opens this week); William T. Williams (whose recent paintings are on view at the Michael Rosenfeld Gallery); and the late Alma Thomas (whose work is at Mnuchin).

Born in Tupelo, Miss., the seventh of eight children, Mr. Gilliam grew up in the shadow of the Great Depression. He was still in grade school when his family moved to Louisville, Ky., where his father worked for the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. His mother, Estery, was a seamstress who belonged to a sewing group, and the artist later credited her for encouraging his boyhood love of art. In 1962, after graduating from the University of Louisville with both a bachelor's degree and a master's in fine art, Mr. Gilliam settled in Washington, where he developed his signature style. The artist is best known for his so-called Drape paintings, which he began in 1968, when he did away with the tradition of the rectangular canvas by ditching stretcher bars, the wooden strips used to lend a painting its drum-taut surface. Instead, he hung up his canvases as if they were full-length curtains, creating droopy, sometimes swoopy objects that could be described, in mathematical terms, as a series of catenary curves. They could sway gently, or subtly change their shape. They remind you that the history of art, wherever it roams, is inseparable from the history of humble cotton cloth. ""Double Merge"" is a rousing sight. It conjoins two of the artist's early Drape paintings into an exuberant, site-specific configuration that occupies a gallery of its own. At first, it appears to be floating or levitating in midair. It is monumental and carnivalesque, and can put you in mind of American architecture at its most vernacular, especially old-fashioned circus tents, with their bold stripes and peaked, cascading tops. But its heavy folds of cotton duck also convey a sense of gracefulness. Some observers have likened the Drape pieces to cathedrals. At the very least, they hint at a form of shelter, a cheerful one festooned with a startling rainbow of trippy, hippie, tie-dye colors and patterns.

The two canvases that were tapped for the installation are both titled ""Carousel II"" (1968), and each one unfurls at a length of about 75 feet. Which is not to say that they're twins. The one on the left hews closer to the wall, and has soft-edged bars of color melting into each other with the unapologetic allure of a pink-streaked sunset. The second painting, which stands to the right, is comparatively chaotic and crossed with long lines that were apparently created by folding and creasing a still-wet canvas, a technique that resembles the Japanese craft of shibori, or hand-dyeing. The painting protrudes aggressively into the viewer's space, and raises a favorite art-historical conundrum: Is it a painting or is it a sculpture? Another work in the exhibition -- the only other one, in fact -- might seem to pose a similar question. ""Spread,"" a large, horizontal, cherry-red abstraction crackling with citrusy oranges and yellows, has poles that tilt across its surface as if to offer a dyed-fabric version of Pollock's ""Blue Poles."" Although ""Spread"" is not a Drape painting -- it stays in place on the wall much the way paintings are supposed to do -- it, too, comes with a novel twist. It belongs to Mr. Gilliam's ""Beveled-Edged"" series, in which he slants his stretcher bars at a 45-degree angle, making them instantly visible to the viewer and adding an element of bulk or boxiness to the painting. Is this detail important? An accompanying handout that is intended for the general public can feel a bit academic, emphasizing how Mr. Gilliam's methods ""transition his two-dimensional paintings away from the flatness traditionally associated with the medium and toward three-dimensional space."" He's presented as a kind of post-Minimalist whose concerns happen to jibe with those of the sculptors collected in depth by Dia. They include Robert Morris, the master of draped industrial felt, and Anne Truitt, who is also from Washington, and whose spare, platonic, monochromatic objects occupy a teasingly ambiguous realm where painting leaves off and sculpture begins. But Mr. Gilliam himself has not characterized his work in Minimalist or post-Minimalist terms. If anything, he has said that his work derives from more earthy and accidental inspirations. His Drape paintings, he said last month, ""might have been inspired by seeing laundry hanging on a clothesline."" He made the comment in an interview with the art historian Barbara Rose, and added, intriguingly, that he could not discount the possible influence of a coterie of artists he had met in Paris in the early '60s who branded their efforts ""sans chassis"" -- which is French for ""off the stretcher."" At any rate, one wouldn't want to pin the Drape paintings to a single source. They are richly and dreamily allusive. ""Double Merge"" has many layers of meaning, and its spirit, however festive at first glance, can also feel mournful. As it hangs down from the ceiling, or rather from wooden slats that attach to points along the top of the canvas that are bunched and tied with brown leather straps, the piece can evoke an unsettling sense of hanging bodies, of lynchings, and the incalculable sorrows of the American past. ""When artists leave the South,"" Mr. Gilliam once said to the historian William Ferris, ""their southernness takes on guises.""",Is it a painting or a sculpture? It's both.

Travel,"A Year After Paris Attacks, Challenges for Hotels and Restaurants",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/travel/a-year-after-paris-attacks-tourism-challenges.html,"The attacks hurt us right away -- our usual occupancy rates were 80 to 82 percent, but in December and January, they were 60 percent. We bounced back slightly in the spring, but as of October, our average occupancy for the year is 72 percent. The biggest change is that we have fewer leisure travelers than before -- our weekdays are busy with business travelers, but our weekends, which used to be 100 percent full, are only 70 percent full. Also, these leisure travelers now book six weeks in advance instead of six months. Our all-day restaurant is faring better. After last November, we went from serving 800 meals to 400 meals a day, but now, we're back up to where we were. It's never occurred to me to lower room prices because they're already low. I'm hopeful that, eventually, like the restaurant, occupancy comes back.

EDWIGE CHEVALLIER, the general manager and owner of W Travel France, a Paris-based company selling half- to multiday tours of Paris.

Typically, May, June and September are our busiest months -- we sell 20 to 30 tours a day, but this year, the most we managed in these months was 15. And, instead of booking six months in advance, clients, most of whom are from the United States, will book a few weeks or even just a few days in advance. The unpredictability of whether I will get bookings or not is stressful, but I hope that by next summer, people won't be afraid to come to Paris anymore.

LAURENT GARDINIER, the co-owner of Les 110 de Taillevent Paris, a wine bar, and Taillevent, a 70-year-old restaurant with two Michelin stars; both are in the Eighth Arrondissement

Paris has always attracted tourists, but since Nov. 13, it feels like the city has been forgotten. I see this at Taillevent -- 70 percent of our dinner crowd used to be tourists, mainly Americans and Japanese, but right after the attacks, they stopped coming, and earlier this year, business was down 20 to 30 percent. Though the average dinner costs between 250 and 300 euros a person, I don't think price is an issue for these diners -- it's fear that's keeping them from Paris. At Les 110, where a meal is around 85 euros a person, we haven't been hurt because the diners are mostly Parisian. But, the situation may be improving because the reservations at Taillevent for September and October are almost as high as they were last year.","Hotel occupancy is down and a tour operator says business is off, but there are some signs that tourists may be returning to the city.",a26f36ff-0d2f-5a77-9cbc-0366c3610f38,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/13/travel/13UPDATEPARIS/13UPDATEPARIS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=1427624653c14a6ff911a4ff446bce8d3b18663f6e7c756eecd1e9c0b8f34000&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Though repeat customers stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel George V, there were fewer first-time travelers.",a26f36ff-0d2f-5a77-9cbc-0366c3610f38,N24News/imgs/a26f36ff-0d2f-5a77-9cbc-0366c3610f38.jpg,4
Fashion & Style,"For Indie Designers, Uniting Is a Survival Skill",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/11/fashion/retail-coop-flying-solo-new-york-fashion-week.html,"For an independent designer operating in a world of megabrands like Amazon, Zara, Nike and H&M, an old maxim may hold the key to survival: United we are stronger. At least that was the thinking Elizabeth Solomeina applied when she was struggling to find a way to show and sell the jewelry she designs without spending huge amounts of money on rent or outsourcing her work to various boutiques. ""I needed a place to sell my stuff, I needed a customer base,"" Ms. Solomeina said. ""When stylists wanted to come over to my studio, I would tell them it's in Brooklyn, and they would be like, 'Never mind.'""

""I wasn't alone,"" she said. ""I had friends like this, too."" So in the summer of 2016, she gathered 34 of them and together they pitched in funds to open a boutique called Flying Solo on Mulberry Street in NoLIta. Within three months, the group had expanded to 45 designers. In June of this year, it grew again, adding more than 20 to the roster and moving to a two-floor shop on West Broadway, on the same block as Missoni, Aesop and DKNY.

Last Friday, during New York Fashion Week, the group of 68 held a two-hour-long presentation and runway show in the store, displaying more than 350 looks. During the presentation, models in neutral colors showed off jewelry and accessories, rotating every few minutes. The runway show included a variety of aesthetic visions. Most of the pieces were the kind you could walk out onto the street wearing, and all were available immediately after the show.

As techno beats and songs by Little Dragon, Migos and Sango pounded through the speakers, models strutted by in metallic and brightly colored pants and jackets (from Daniel Silverstain, who has designed for Solange and Lady Gaga); long coats with ""Proud Immigrant"" written across the back (from Ricardo Seco, a Mexican designer); tweed suits and knit dresses (from Kathrin Henon, who works with Dennis Basso); and much more.

Between each section of the show, models in silver pants and Flying Solo T-shirts created by the designers walked by with signs denoting the next designer's Instagram handle. Flying Solo operates somewhat like a grocery or building co-op, with members paying a membership fee that goes toward rent, production and marketing costs for events like the fashion week show. Each member is required to work eight hours every week, opening and closing the store, cleaning and helping customers on the floor. When the team members opened their first store on Mulberry Street, they put together as much of the interior themselves as they could. ""We designed the racks, the shelving,"" Ms. Solomeina said. ""Our designers were sketching, running to Home Depot, assembling racks."" They were ready for customers in three days. On West Broadway, it took all of four. ""It's our sweat and I hope no tears,"" Ms. Solomeina said. Flying Solo has had help from outside. Early on, Ms. Solomeina secured funding from Alex Barnett, an investor who has worked with technology companies and charities. Mr. Barnett saw in Ms. Solomeina's proposal a model for the future. ""A lot of them are really brilliant designers,"" he said of Flying Solo's members. ""It's a tragedy that the brilliance isn't rewarded. A lot of times it's who has a lot of capital or who gets picked up by a big brand or whatever the trend is at that moment."" Speaking of the changes in the retail landscape that have been spurred by the advent of technology and the expansion of giants like Amazon, Zara and H&M, Mr. Barnett said: ""I don't think change should be feared. It's creating space for innovation. Independent designers need to stop working against each other and realize they're all on the same side.""",Several dozen designers have pooled their resources to market their wares in a boutique in SoHo.,8309a11f-f5a8-5f57-b9f2-8696fd6e5720,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/14/fashion/11FLYINGSOLO/11FLYINGSOLO-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=2bc66248ec549c82ca40b4bd5b99cc0a17c4827407f158360b5dcce739e4028d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"At Flying Solo, a fashion co-op in SoHo, new looks from Daniel Silverstain.",8309a11f-f5a8-5f57-b9f2-8696fd6e5720,N24News/imgs/8309a11f-f5a8-5f57-b9f2-8696fd6e5720.jpg,19

Music,"Moraes Moreira, 72, Dies; Brazilian Songwriter and 'Cowboy of Sound'",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/arts/music/moraes-moreira-dead.html,"Moraes Moreira, an exuberantly prolific Brazilian songwriter who fused the regional traditions of his home state, Bahia, with an ever-changing array of styles in a career that stretched from the late 1960s through the 2010s, died on April 13 at his home in Rio de Janeiro. He was 72. His son Davi Moraes said the cause was a heart attack. Mr. Moreira was the main composer in Os Novos Baianos (the New Bahians), whose early 1970s albums were both hits and cultural milestones in Brazil. Most of their songs had music by Mr. Moreira and lyrics by Luiz Galvao. In 2007, Rolling Stone Brasil named Os Novos Baianos's 1972 album, ""Acabou Chorare"" (""The Crying Is Over"") -- which mixed, among other things, bossa nova, samba, rock and the vintage Brazilian style called choro -- the most important album in the history of Brazilian music. Mr. Moreira moved on to a solo career that would encompass dozens of albums over four decades. His songs were also recorded by many leading Brazilian pop singers, yielding No. 1 hits in Brazil for Gal Costa, Simone, Ney Matogrosso and others.

Mr. Moreira constantly forged new hybrids with Bahian roots. His songs, written with a shifting assortment of lyricists, often celebrated Brazil's multicultural vitality. He helped nationally popularize the Bahian carnival tradition called trio eletrico (electric-guitar bands riding on trucks), and through the decades he also drew on psychedelia, funk, orchestral arrangements, electronic music and rap, as well as Brazilian styles like samba, baiao, frevo and afoxe. The bossa nova master Joao Gilberto, an early mentor of Os Novos Baianos, called Mr. Moreira ""a cowboy of sound."" Mr. Moreira was born Antonio Carlos Moreira Pires on July 8, 1947, in Ituacu, in rural Bahia. He learned to play accordion and then guitar in his teens and moved to Salvador, the capital of Bahia, planning to study medicine. But he was drawn to music instead. He met Tom Ze, a leading songwriter in the Bahia-centered avant-pop movement called tropicalia. ""I showed him my stuff and he said: 'Yeah, you have talent. I'll give you some guitar lessons. I won't charge because I know you don't have the money to pay,'"" Mr. Moreira told Rolling Stone Brasil. Mr. Ze also connected him to Mr. Galvao, starting the songwriting partnership that led to the formation of Os Novos Baianos in 1968; it also included the guitarist Pepeu Gomes and the singers Baby Consuelo and Paulinho Boca de Cantor. They moved from Salvador to Sao Paulo to Rio de Janeiro, living and working as a hippie commune and writing songs under the influence of marijuana and LSD, Mr. Moreira told interviewers. He left Os Novos Baianos and released his first solo album, called simply ""Moraes Moreira,"" in 1975. Through the 1970s, '80s and '90s, he released an album nearly every year. He sang with the original Bahian trio eletrico, Dodo and Osmar, at Bahia's carnival in 1976, introducing vocals to what had been an instrumental style.

Mr. Moreira celebrated Bahian carnival in songs that became carnival-season hits and in his touring stage shows. Although he decided in the 1980s that the event had grown too commercial, he marked his 50th birthday in 1997 with the album ""50 Carnavais"" and frequently performed at Salvador's carnival in the 2000s. In 1990, he made an album with Pepeu Gomes from Os Novos Baianos. The full group reunited for concerts in 1995 and toured again sporadically from 2016 to 2019. In 2007, Mr. Moreira published a memoir, ""The History of the New Bahians and Other Verses."" While he celebrated the 40th anniversary of ""Acabou Chorare"" at concerts in 2012, he also released a new album that year, ""A Revolta dos Ritmos."" He released his last album of new songs, ""Ser Tao,"" in 2018. (The name means ""be so"" and is also a pun on sertao, Brazil's rural northeastern region.) After all Mr. Moreira's stylistic fusions and technological experiments, ""Ser Tao"" revisited the guitar- and accordion-driven styles he had grown up hearing in Bahia. Mr. Moreira often performed with his son Davi, a guitarist, who survives him, along with another son, Ari Moreira; a daughter, Maria Cecilia Moraes; and three grandchildren. In March, amid the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Moreira self-quarantined alone at his house in Rio de Janeiro, where he continued to write. On March 18, he posted a poem about quarantine on his Facebook page. In an interview this year with the Brazilian newspaper O Globo, he said he was planning a concert to include more than 20 of his unpublished songs. Fellow musicians, many of whom had collaborated with him through the years, posted admiring messages on social media. Gilberto Gil, the Bahian songwriter who has also been Brazil's minister of culture, wrote on Twitter: ""A boy from the hinterland of Bahia listened, enchanted, to the music of the world, and made it his expressive universe. He leaves sorrow and a grand body of work.""","His songs, written with a shifting assortment of lyricists, forged musical hybrids with his Bahian roots and celebrated Brazil's multicultural vitality.",b05603e2-689a-5f15-8e4c-82cce64b56d1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/23/obituaries/15Moreira/15Moreira-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=f0515d3c0dde89ccee0efc971fcbe77a10596291a87c328e416630a3b2655597&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Moraes Moreira in performance in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.

Health,Should Youth Come First in Coronavirus Care?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/health/coronavirus-ethics-rationing-elderly.html,"In April, as the coronavirus was rampaging through the Northeast, Larry Churchill considered what he would do if the pandemic caused medical shortages. Should he, a 75-year-old, direct care to younger people before him if he got sick? He was in a good position to raise the question. A bioethicist retired from Vanderbilt University, he published an essay on the Hastings Center's bioethics forum saying that he intended to avoid hospitals if they became overwhelmed and forgo a ventilator if equipment grew scarce. When a vaccine became available, he would move to the end of the line. Fortunately, Dr. Churchill has not had to face such decisions. He remains healthy, writing and teaching, and hiking in the Blue Ridge Mountains. And enough ventilators were produced to meet demand. But as new cases surge across the country and the flu season looms, the prospect of rationing has resurfaced. Some policies adopted by states or health care systems to allocate medical resources -- equipment, drugs, critical care and intensive-care beds -- specifically make age part of the equation. Other guidelines appear more neutral, but incorporate factors that nevertheless disfavor older people, like other health conditions or life expectancy.

After much discussion of what younger people owe their elders, who are at greater risk from Covid-19, some older adults are contemplating their obligations to the young. ""Part of the moral meaning of aging lies in a sense of reciprocity across generations,"" Dr. Churchill wrote in his essay. He does not believe that older people are less deserving of care, nor would he want his personal philosophy to become public policy, he said; other older adults will reach different conclusions. But he subscribes to a ""life span approach"" to ethics, sometimes called the ""fair innings"" approach: He has had his turns at bat. Younger people have had less time to experience life's opportunities and pleasures. ""That's why the death of a 40-year-old is tragic -- we see so much unfulfilled potential,"" he said in an interview. ""My death at 75 would be sad for the people who love me, but not tragic.""

His is a minority opinion among those considering medical ethics and legal protections in a pandemic. Professional associations like the American Geriatrics Society and advocacy groups like Justice in Aging have focused more on the opposite possibility: They want to prevent older and disabled people from being arbitrarily sent to the rear of the line. ""You can have a fairly young individual who is frail and behaves like an 85-year-old, and 85-year-olds who are running marathons,"" said Dr. Timothy Farrell, the vice-chair of the American Geriatrics Society's ethics committee and a geriatrician at University of Utah Health. ""So to say that 85-year-olds don't have a claim on resources seems unjust."" In June, the society published a position statement aimed at government policymakers and hospital administrators. It warned that age categories, which some states apply to determine access to care in disease outbreaks, natural disasters and other crises, should never be used to exclude patients from treatment. The statement also opposes criteria like ""life-years saved"" and long-term life expectancy, which similarly disadvantage the older population. Instead, it recommends treating patients based on the likelihood of being discharged from the hospital and surviving for six months. ""Our ability as physicians to prognosticate is generally poor, particularly in the heat of the moment,"" Dr. Farrell said. Short-term predictions are more accurate. The society took no position on whether age should serve as a ""tiebreaker,"" as some ethics guidelines permit in cases where two patients are deemed equally likely to survive. But ""that would be bias, in our view,"" said Regan Bailey, the director of litigation for Justice in Aging. Her organization, along with others representing disabled people and older adults, has filed several complaints with the Office of Civil Rights at the federal Department of Health and Human Services, charging that state policies for allocating health care during a crisis violate federal civil rights laws.

In March, the Office of Civil Rights reaffirmed that the Affordable Care Act and other federal statutes prohibit discrimination, in health facilities receiving federal funds, on the basis of age, disability and other characteristics. Nevertheless, the coalition has argued that guidelines in Oregon, Arizona and northern Texas remain discriminatory. For example, Arizona, which activated its crisis guidelines in June, includes long-term mortality as a consideration, along with the ability to experience ""life stages."" While those cases are pending, other civil rights complaints have brought changes in Tennessee, Pennsylvania and Alabama. None of these efforts, however, prevent individuals like Dr. Churchill from voluntarily declining treatment to benefit the young, or for any other reason. Specifying one's choices, using an advance directive, is of greater importance than ever during a pandemic. For those who want to yield their place in the health care line, an organization called Save Other Souls has developed a document that takes effect during a declared state of emergency for Covid-19. Vetted by lawyers, it allows people of any age to cede medical equipment, drugs or hospital care to others. The directive lapses when the emergency ends, or after 18 months. ""It's akin to the person who runs into a burning building or gives up the last seat on the lifeboat,"" said Dr. Andrea Kittrell, an otolaryngologist in Lynchburg, Va., who created the organization in March. ""There are those people who are selfless and generous and value other people's lives as much or more than their own."" Winnona Merritt, for example, works daily in her vegetable garden in High Point, N.C., sharing cucumbers and squash with her neighbors. Vigorous at 82, Ms. Merritt said she would welcome more good years. But in a pandemic, ""I'm afraid I could go to the head of the line, ahead of someone younger, with a family,"" she said. ""I don't need that. I've had a wonderful life."" With her family's support, she signed an S.O.S. directive. Research suggests that altruism and generosity increase at older ages. For example, in recruiting volunteers for Experience Corps, which trains seniors to assist in public schools, the most effective recruiting messages appealed to a person's desire to help the next generation.

Successful programs like Experience Corps also point to a common criticism of the fair innings philosophy: The last innings of the game can be among the most significant. ""We may be missing out on the contributions people make later in life,"" Dr. Farrell said. Moreover, some individuals, for reasons including race, gender or poverty, never got their fair innings. Of course, forgoing health care isn't the only altruistic response to Covid-19. Jeffrey Balkind, 73, a retired World Bank administrator in Washington, has volunteered for clinical vaccine trials. Mr. Balkind has had two close encounters with death, as a hostage during a 1981 airliner hijacking, then after a 2017 accident with his Vespa scooter. Injured and hospitalized, he resolved that ""if I ever had a chance, I would try to do something useful in the medical field."" It wasn't simple. For the initial trial of a vaccine candidate developed by the biotech company Moderna and the National Institutes of Health, Mr. Balkind underwent a health screening by phone and a two-hour physical exam, then signed a 23-page consent form. He was deeply disappointed to be placed on a standby list. But he was accepted into the much larger Phase 3 trial now underway, and expected to receive his first dose on Monday. ""I am thrilled,"" he said. ""I feel I'm on a fascinating adventure.""","If medical rationing becomes necessary, some older adults are prepared to step aside. But many have the opposite concern: that they will be arbitrarily sent to the rear of the line.",96c2265f-5630-580b-90db-280ca5120daa,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/04/science/31SCI-SPAN/31SCI-SPAN-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=4d0fce25e374c4e53e40b07dfe54c0ac671d7f838c3689ef46bf9b99506f355f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Larry Churchill, a bioethicist from Vanderbilt University.

Opinion,"To Understand the Wuhan Coronavirus, Look to the Epidemic Triangle",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/opinion/wuhan-coronavirus-epidemic.html,"Five cases of the mysterious Wuhan coronavirus have been confirmed in the United States, giving rise to concerns about a potential global pandemic. We've seen this story before, as health authorities working with threadbare data try to walk the line between epidemic readiness and needless panic. Is this new outbreak poised to become the next AIDS pandemic or a new SARS, which was stopped in its tracks after 774 deaths? To cut through the headlines, we can use a simple concept called the ""epidemic triangle."" Employed by epidemiologists since the discipline's earliest days, it is indispensable in predicting whether localized outbreaks will transform into full-blown epidemics. The epidemic triangle is essentially an equation. It posits that every outbreak, regardless of its specific traits, is dependent on the interplay between three factors: the pathogen (the agent causing infection), the host (the organism at risk of infection) and the environment (the setting where the infections occur). Every single epidemic -- be it the flu, cholera or even behavioral epidemics like drunken driving -- is the result of a dynamic shift in one of these points of the epidemic triangle, which then causes a domino effect leading to a sudden explosion of new cases. In one classic example of this phenomenon, we have an environmental shift to thank for the emergence of the global flu pandemic. In the mid-16th century, ducks were introduced to Chinese rice paddies to feed on the insects that were destroying crops. That meant ducks joined another common feature of Chinese farms: pigs. The duck's unique biology makes it a generous reservoir for a vast number of viruses, while pigs are uncannily efficient at mixing different viruses together into new strains and passing them to humans. Breeding these two animals in proximity quickly led to the combination and transmission of new viral strains. Novel and highly virulent pathogens -- hybrid pig-duck influenza strains -- then crossed the species barrier and have been tormenting humanity ever since.

The family of coronaviruses (so-called because they resemble glowing crowns) that includes the new Wuhan strain are exceptionally challenging to control. Coronaviruses are responsible for the common cold, pneumonia and bronchitis, but the coronavirus family is sprawling and includes deadlier outliers like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which have fatality rates of up to 15 percent and 35 percent, respectively. The big question, then, is whether the Wuhan coronavirus is closer to the common cold or to SARS. While its case fatality rate is unknown, as of Wednesday there were more 6,000 confirmed cases worldwide (with about 80 outside of mainland China) and at least 130 people dead.

Last week, the World Health Organization convened a special committee to decide whether to declare a global health emergency. Ultimately, after two days of deliberation, the group decided not to take this major step, though the W.H.O.'s director general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, noted ominously that ""it may yet become one."" That time may have come: Today, the W.H.O. committee will convene again to determine if the outbreak has crossed a threshold into warranting a designation of a global emergency. As it considers how to proceed, the W.H.O. committee is grappling with a monumental choice -- global health emergencies are legally binding announcements requiring every United Nations member state to take action -- with scant data. I don't doubt that the epidemic triangle is critical in helping W.H.O. navigate this process. Is this outbreak because of a substantive shift in the genetic makeup of an old pathogen, a change in the vulnerability of the host population or an alteration of the environment that has shaped the threat emanating from Wuhan? As the Wuhan outbreak continues to expand, applying the calculus of the epidemic triangle remains the most reliable way to chart an effective public health response while avoiding a descent into hysteria. First, we need to know how much of a shift this new pathogen is from previous coronavirus strains, based on its infective potential and virulence. Judging from the rapid rise in cases since the first cluster was reported on Dec. 31, the new Wuhan strain could very well be highly infective. For perspective, SARS has a relatively low basic reproductive ratio (or R0) of 0.5, meaning that every two cases of SARS results in only one additional infection. Very early estimates shared by the W.H.O. suggest the Wuhan strain's R0 is 1.4 to 2.5, producing roughly two secondary cases for each initial infection, which places it slightly higher than the seasonal flu (for perspective, measles has a R0 of 12 to 18). If the new coronavirus's R0 remains low as more data become available, we can be relatively confident that surveillance and quarantine will stem its spread, though these measures become steadily less effective as the R0 increases. With respect to its virulence, early genomic sequencing of the Wuhan virus suggests, thankfully, that it is only distantly related to SARS (they are only 73 percent identical), meaning that it is likely to be less deadly, though it is too early to say with confidence.

Second, we have to ask how this outbreak might be explained by a shift in the vulnerability of its host (human beings). What scientists will be looking for here is an indication that those who have died are older or immune-compromised, consistent with the fatalities we see from other common coronavirus infections. That leaves the environment, the last point of the epidemic triangle -- and this is where things get complicated. As China's economy has expanded, the number of Chinese citizens taking to the skies has risen astronomically. Much has been made about this week's Lunar New Year celebration, and rightly so: it is the world's largest human migration, with as many as three billion planned trips by car, train and plane within China over a two-week period. The challenges of quarantining during this migration are staggering, though China is better equipped than most countries to carry out draconian public health measures, and has demonstrated its resolve by imposing a lockdown on travel for -- at last count -- more than 50 million of its citizens.

Where the environment has truly shifted, though, is in China's connections to the rest of the world. In 2005, two years after the first SARS outbreak, there were only 233 international air routes from mainland China. By 2016, international routes had more than tripled to 739, meaning there were far more routes for the virus to take out of the country. During the same period, the number of international air passengers traveling in and out of China exploded from around three million to over 51 million. In short, China's increasingly outward-facing stance has greatly expanded the environment within which the Wuhan coronavirus can propagate. This, among all three of the points of the epidemic triangle, makes predicting the scope of the current outbreak exceedingly complex. As we face new epidemic threats, no matter what their origin, we can rely on one constant: Each will ultimately be explained by the interaction of the three points of the epidemic triangle. In the case of the Wuhan coronavirus, what should trouble us the most is the rapid expansion of the environment across which the pathogen can infect its hosts, which maps neatly over China's emergence as a global superpower. It remains to be seen whether the scale of this change is enough to transform it from a SARS-like scare -- a blip in epidemic history -- and into the next Spanish flu.

Technology,Amazon Said to Be Under Scrutiny in 2 States for Abuse of Power,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/technology/state-inquiry-antitrust-amazon.html,"SEATTLE -- State investigators in California and Washington have been looking into whether Amazon abuses its power over sellers on the tech giant's site, according to people involved with the inquiry.

In the last several months, California has asked about the company's private label products and whether it uses data from sellers to inform which products it sells, according to two people, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution by the company.

The Washington attorney general's office has also been interested in whether Amazon makes it harder for sellers to list their products on other websites, according to correspondence viewed by The New York Times.

The people said that the inquiries did not appear to be in advanced stages.

The interest in Amazon's lucrative marketplace is a signal that scrutiny of the company is widening, including criticism of the working conditions in its warehouses and accusations that it boxes out small business and competitors.

Style,"Michou, Whose Drag Cabaret Was the Toast of Paris, Dies at 88",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/style/michou-dead.html,"Michou, Whose Drag Cabaret Was the Toast of Paris, Dies at 88

Michou, a flamboyant fixture of the Parisian demimonde who ran France's most celebrated drag cabaret for more than a half-century, died on Sunday night in a hospital in Saint-Mande, a suburb of Paris. He was 88. The cause was a pulmonary embolism, said Francois Deblaye, Michou's press representative. ""He hadn't been able to breathe very well for a while,"" he said. Last year, Michou was treated for colon cancer, which was said to be in remission. It was in 1956 that Michou -- born Michel Georges Alfred Catty -- opened his tiny jewel box of a nightclub at the foot of Montmartre, the storied Paris neighborhood known for its nightclubs and connection with artists like Picasso and Toulouse-Lautrec. Dressed habitually in blue, with a snowy white coif, manicured fingernails, a perpetually wide smile and a glass of Champagne always in hand, Michou was instantly recognizable in France, in part from his many television appearances. His death was front page news in France.

In Montmartre he was known for holding free luncheons for elderly residents. Cafes there engraved his name on plaques on his favorite seats, permanently reserving them for him. Local residents often blew kisses at him as he walked to his cabaret from his apartment overlooking Sacre Coeur, the basilica at the heart of Montmartre. ""They call me the 'Blue Prince of Montmartre,'"" Michou told The New York Times in an interview last March. (Even his home was decorated entirely in shades of blue, right down to a turquoise toilet seat.) ""Around here, I'm treated like a saint.""

Prominent politicians, actors and singers were his friends, and his cabaret was lined with photos of him hugging the likes of Sophia Loren and Jacques Chirac, who as president of France had awarded him the Legion of Honor, the country's highest order of merit. He was a close friend of first ladies of France, including Brigitte Macron, President Emmanuel Macron's wife, who, like Michou, hailed from Amiens, an industrial town in northern France.

Chez Michou's big draw was a colorful spectacle called ""transformiste,"" featuring a parade of performers in drag impersonating female luminaries of bygone eras, like the diva Maria Callas and Dalida, the Egyptian-born singer and actress from the 1950s. Night after night, the cabaret was packed with visitors from around France and from around the world. As one of Paris's most famous openly gay performers, Michou left another cultural mark: ""He helped open doors to liberate others,"" Francois Soustre, a French writer who is the co-author of an autobiography of Michou, told The Times last March. Michel Georges Alfred Catty was born in June 1931 in Amiens and raised by his mother and a grandmother. At age 19, he wrote, he told his mother he was attracted to men. ""What would you say if I was a homosexual?"" he recalled asking her. Her support gave Michou confidence to leave Amiens and make his way to Paris, where he settled near the legendary Moulin Rouge cabaret. He found work at a cafe on Rue des Martyrs. After befriending the owner, he eventually bought the cafe from her, transforming it into a dinner theater featuring himself and two friends as dancers.

""I did the cooking, the cleaning and the dancing,"" he said. Michou famously avoided drinking water, preferring to hydrate himself with up to two bottles of Champagne a day -- a habit that, by his account, once prompted a former first lady, Bernadette Chirac, a close friend, to admonish him. He replied: ""I don't smoke, and I don't do drugs. At least leave me the pleasure of Champagne!"" He is survived by his longtime companion, Erwann Toularastel; a half sister, Micheline; and a niece, Catherine Baudelin.","Since 1956, his jewel box of a club in storied Montmartre has drawn a host of luminaries, turning the proprietor himself into one.",b1d9bf1b-7492-5d8d-8025-6fee62dc4c0c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/28/obituaries/27Michou4/27Michou4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=677252664870e1e74082bda1f6c764c2c2b5540c3d7d8f16aad637c43afe45f2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Michou, in foreground, was flanked by the performer Silvestre, left, and the composer Georges Garvarentz at Chez Michou in 1986.

Theater,Staging Reality Winner: An F.B.I. Transcript Becomes an Offbeat Thriller,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/30/theater/reality-winner-tina-satter-half-straddle.html,"Tina Satter, right, is directing Emily Davis in ""Is This a Room,"" a play about the F.B.I.'s 2017 interrogation of the military contractor Reality Winner.

Last December, the theater director Tina Satter was stuck at a desk, temping as a receptionist, when she fell down an internet rabbit hole. After reading the New York magazine profile of Reality Winner -- the 20-something military contractor charged with leaking a single top-secret document about Russian election hacking -- Ms. Satter clicked a link to a blog post about Ms. Winner's pantyhose, and then another link to a grainy PDF of an official F.B.I. transcript. It recorded the moment in June 2017 when a fleet of federal agents entered Ms. Winner's Georgia home, interrogated her and extracted a confession. Ms. Satter read the transcript online, but when she recalls it now, she makes the gesture of dramatically flipping pages in the air. ""Immediately I thought, This is a play,"" she said. ""This is a thriller."" Reading the government document through the lens of a director, Ms. Satter saw a title printed across the top -- ""VERBATIM TRANSCRIPTION"" -- followed by a list of ""participants,"" or characters: Reality Winner, whose name alone feels theatrical; the two special agents who interrogated her that day; and a mysterious figure listed only as ""Unknown Male."" The transcript was intriguing in its precision. Every stutter, sigh, and stray sound was noted. It was also jumping with subtext: Even as they circled Ms. Winner with an espionage charge, the F.B.I. agents made small talk about the weather, CrossFit and her cat. Everyone there was struggling to act casual in the least casual of circumstances.

And then there was Ms. Winner herself, with whom Ms. Satter quickly grew fascinated. Ms. Winner is an Air Force veteran fluent in several Afghan languages. In 2017, she was 25 and working at a Georgia contractor complex, translating communications related to Iranian aerospace. She taught yoga for fun and scribbled on ""pretty paper"" at work. She tweeted insults about President Trump. She owned guns -- pink guns. In the transcript, she toggles seamlessly between high-level intelligence language and jokes about her ""resting bitch face."" Ms. Winner seemed to represent a new kind of figure. ""I could totally relate to her dismay at living through America over the past two years, and her sort of pop response to it,"" Ms. Satter said. ""This is such a patriot of right now.""

But Ms. Winner's status as a young woman navigating an unfamiliar world connected it to other Half Straddle shows. Ms. Winner opens a window into a new kind of subculture: the banal office grind at the heart of the American security state, which has expanded so relentlessly that thousands of otherwise ordinary Americans have insight into classified material. Thanks to websites that surface the day's ""trending"" classified ""articles,"" which Ms. Winner browsed while bored at work, even top-secret material begins to seem almost public. And while ""Is This a Room"" is on its face a re-enactment, there are elements of the transcript that pitch it into the surreal, and allow for interpretive space. Lines attributed to ""Unknown Male"" -- dreamlike fragments of loose F.B.I. chatter picked up by the interrogators' recorder -- are all played on stage by Half Straddle company member Becca Blackwell. (The play's title, ""Is This a Room,"" is one of them.) Swaths of the transcript are redacted in black, and in the weeks leading up to the premiere, Ms. Satter was still puzzling out how to dramatize them. On stage, the surreality will be punctuated by the disorienting sounds of Sanae Yamada, a musician who has written a synth-based score as well as a pop song about Ms. Winner called ""Pretty Paper."" At a recent rehearsal at the Kitchen, Ms. Satter stalked around the bare set in a Mickey Mouse T-shirt, blocking the strange moment when the F.B.I. agents (played by Pete Simpson and T.L. Thompson) drum what sounds like a confession out of Ms. Winner, and then seamlessly return to discussing her cat, who is on a diet. (""Oh, she's a big girl,"" Unknown Male tells Ms. Winner.) Here the actors slowed their speech and tipped their bodies, giving the impression of a mind spinning, as the synth music closed in.

The transcript itself was a crucial artifact in the legal proceedings. Her defense argued that the transcript, and its apparent confession, ought to be barred from court, as the F.B.I. never read Ms. Winner her Miranda rights or told her she was free to leave her home. But the government argued that the transcript proved that the agents had been so ""exceedingly friendly"" to Ms. Winner that she could not have been forced into talking. Staging the transcript felt like a way to reveal its hidden power dynamics. ""There was so much happening right underneath the surface of the language,"" said Ms. Davis. The actress shares both a physical resemblance to Ms. Winner and a South Texas background. She sees Ms. Winner as a ""vibrant and sparkly person"" who became isolated by her work for her country and ended up in a ""lonely, vulnerable place."" And she is sensitive to the fact that in the play, she is moving about the world as Ms. Winner while Ms. Winner herself is locked away. Those sensitivities were heightened when Billie Winner-Davis, Reality's mother, heard about the production and reached out. A snapshot of Reality Winner taken on the day of her arrest. Ms. Winner's mother provided it to the production, and it has inspired an actress's costuming. Ms. Satter and Ms. Davis have since been in close contact with her, and have exchanged letters with Reality herself. Both sides have approach the contents of the play gingerly; Ms. Satter has not asked Ms. Davis-Winner for insights into her daughter, and Ms. Davis-Winner has not inquired about the theatermakers' process. (She will attend the first performance, with some trepidation: While she is eager for others to learn of her daughter's story, ""I don't know whether I'll be able to sit through it all,"" she said.) She did assist in one way: She sent a photograph the F.B.I. took of Reality outside her home on the day she was arrested, which inspired Ms. Davis's costume. In the photo, she's leaning against a brick wall in jean shorts and canary-yellow Converse. Her hands are clasped politely in front of her and her eyes are turned down. It's an image of Ms. Winner on the precipice between regular young woman and accused felon. She is outside in the Georgia sun, but the F.B.I. has her in its sights.","In the 2017 interrogation that resulted in a leaking charge, the creators of ""Is This a Room"" found a fascinating mix of the surreal and the banal.",c24ca7e9-c2d1-5796-a9ad-5b0c732e3ad1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/01/arts/01REALITYPLAY1/01REALITYPLAY1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=9db39a43fb1800e9146d70bdbf0c16f9823adf4927f7bb80aac1cdc50f96b52f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Tina Satter, right, is directing Emily Davis in &ldquo;Is This a Room,&rdquo; a play about the F.B.I.&rsquo;s 2017 interrogation of the military contractor Reality Winner.",c24ca7e9-c2d1-5796-a9ad-5b0c732e3ad1,N24News/imgs/c24ca7e9-c2d1-5796-a9ad-5b0c732e3ad1.jpg,10
Automobiles,"Dreaming of Steam, but Running on Gas",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/15/automobiles/15PAXTON.html,"TO Robert Paxton McCulloch, the idea of transplanting London Bridge to an Arizona desert probably seemed no more far-fetched in the 1960s than his dream, nearly two decades earlier, of mass-producing a steam-powered automobile. The difference was, he succeeded in relocating that 19th-century bridge, while his ambitions as an automaker yielded only a single example of the Paxton Phoenix. That prototype eventually drove under its own power -- using a Porsche engine, not steam -- but it was nowhere near ready for showrooms. Still, it embodied elements of design and technology that were ahead of their time, and it served as a showcase for the work of Brooks Stevens, an industrial designer whose creations helped define postwar America. Some of the details, strikingly futuristic for a 1953 model, were visible to anyone who spotted the car last July at the Concours d'Elegance of America near Detroit. Among the features of the Paxton Phoenix that later came into wide use were fiberglass body panels (the Chevrolet Corvette used similar construction) and a retractable hardtop, extraordinary then but a common design for convertibles today.

Like other inventors who tried to create new vehicle brands, Mr. McCulloch was determined to make his car stand out. Backed by a sizable inheritance, he hired people well qualified to match wits with the industry's titans. His team included Roscoe C. Hoffman, a talented engineer and chassis specialist who in the 1930s developed an innovative rear-engine car. Also on board were Abner Doble, a steam-engine expert who had his own car company earlier in the 20th century, and most significant, the forward-thinking Mr. Stevens. In the 2003 book, ""Industrial Strength Design: How Brooks Stevens Shaped Your World,"" Glenn Adamson wrote that while Mr. Stevens created many distinctive products, his goal was to design things that would succeed in the marketplace. That philosophy made him a good match for Mr. McCulloch, whose ventures generally came to a profitable conclusion. Mr. Stevens's father, William C. Stevens, was an inventor of vehicle components, so the son was immersed in the automotive world from an early age. While the father had a passion for the way things worked, the younger Mr. Stevens was more interested in the way things looked, but shared his father's inventiveness.

The Paxton design had little in common with cars of the day. Its headlights were set in scalloped openings evocative of jet engines. Its front bumper dipped below the car's grille. Air vents that rose above the rear fenders -- again suggesting aircraft -- interrupted the machine's smooth, rounded flanks. The rear of the car was reminiscent of boats designed by Mr. Stevens. But most distinctive was the smooth curve of its roof and a corresponding curve on the rear decklid. The repetition of forms was no accident, as the top, when retracted, slid rearward to nestle over the deck lid. Home base for the project was Paxton Engineering, the research arm of Mr. McCulloch's manufacturing enterprises. Near the Los Angeles International Airport, it was where some of Mr. McCulloch's most inventive odysseys took place. Although best known for the chain saws that carried his name, the entrepreneurial engineer was also an auto parts maker, oil baron and real-estate developer. Under the Paxton's fiberglass body was a chassis that borrowed aircraft construction techniques. The independent suspension used torsion bars, similar to the layout of a Porsche 356 -- no coincidence, as one had been bought for Mr. McCulloch's team to dissect and study. In the early stages of the project, Mr. McCulloch had planned to power the car with a 3-cylinder, 6-piston, 2-stroke internal-combustion engine, with a crankshaft at each side and combustion chambers in the middle of the cylinders. That power plant was abandoned in favor of a steam engine. The Paxton steam engine was to be installed between the rear wheels, with the boiler up front. The appeal of steam was strong: almost any liquid fuel could be burned to make steam, and because the steam engine delivered high torque at low speeds, no transmission would be needed.

Abner Doble was a champion of steam power who had some success with his line of steam-powered cars. His best design, the model E of 1923, was capable of 90 m.p.h. But financial mismanagement led to his company's failure, and Mr. Doble spent the rest of his career as a consultant. The engine eventually developed for the Paxton was a compound design using three high-pressure cylinders and three low-pressure cylinders; a flash-tube boiler eliminated the need for long warm-ups typical of early steam cars. The engine was tested in a 1953 Ford, but before it could be installed in the Paxton, the entire project was abandoned.

An article about the Paxton that appeared in Classic & Sports Car magazine in March 2009 suggested that problems with the steam engine led Mr. McCulloch to call it quits. Jerry Williamson, foreman of the Paxton shop in the early 1950s, said in a telephone interview that the steam engine was not the reason that development stopped. ""The death of the car was purely economical,"" said Mr. Williamson, adding that he was the last surviving member of the Phoenix team. ""Tax laws had changed, eliminating some write-offs for research and development. McCulloch simply decided that the car business was not for him."" At some point, the engine and transaxle from the Porsche 356 that Mr. McCulloch bought to tear down for research were installed in the Phoenix. Classic & Sports Car magazine said that this was done after he gave up his plan to mass-produce the car, but Mr. Williamson recalled the Porsche engine being bolted into the Paxton so the chassis could be tested as steam engine development continued. In any case, the Porsche engine became the power source, and it has served in that role ever since.","The Paxton Phoenix was conceived to run on steam, but it didn't turn out that way.

Global Business,"As Its Economy Sags, India Asks a Critic to Come Home and Help Out",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/06/business/global/rajan-an-adviser-to-indian-government-urges-changes-to-economy.html,"NEW DELHI -- In April, the economist Raghuram G. Rajan gave a speech to a group of graduating Indian students in which he criticized the country's policy makers for ""repeating failed experiment after failed experiment,"" rather than learning from the experiences of other countries. A week later, he assailed the government again, this time in a speech attended by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. But instead of drawing a rebuke from India's often thin-skinned leaders, he got a job offer. In August, Mr. Singh, who has frequently sought Mr. Rajan's advice, called and asked him to take a leave from his job as a professor at the University of Chicago to return to India, where he was born, to help revive the country's flagging economy. Within weeks, he was at work as the chief economic adviser in the Finance Ministry. Analysts say the appointment of an outspoken academic like Mr. Rajan, along with the recent push by New Delhi to reduce energy subsidies and open up retailing, insurance and aviation to foreign investment, signal that India's policy makers appear to be serious about tackling the nation's economic problems. Mr. Rajan has advocated changing India's financial system, which is dominated by state-owned banks, by among other things loosening government restrictions on foreign banks and other financial institutions. He has also been critical of the country's crony capitalism, likening its business tycoons to Russia's oligarchs. He has argued that India needs to build stronger, impartial agencies to make the allotment of licenses and natural resources more transparent.

And India might finally be ready to make such changes, he said in an interview in his office here. ""I believe that one of the virtues of a functioning democracy is that they prevent things from getting too bad,"" he said. ""When things get bad, democracy creates the space to make improvements."" Economists say Mr. Rajan, and his boss, the recently reappointed finance minister, Palaniappan Chidambaram, face daunting challenges in their effort to revive the slowing economy, which is expected to post growth of 5.5 percent this year, down from an average of 7.7 percent a year over the last decade. The credit rating agencies Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings have warned that they may downgrade India's sovereign debt to junk status if it doesn't bring its ballooning budget deficit under control. Many of the government's proposals, including reduced subsidies for food and fuel, are deeply unpopular. Moreover, the governing alliance, led by the Indian National Congress Party, recently lost its majority in the lower house of Parliament, which will make it hard to enact legislation. ""Most emerging market governments only carry out reforms when they have their backs to the wall,"" said Ruchir Sharma, an executive at Morgan Stanley and author of the recent book ""Breakout Nations: In Pursuit of the Next Economic Miracles."" ""The government is under siege and they are reacting to that."" Though Mr. Rajan's current post does not carry any executive authority, his return to India has attracted attention because many policy analysts consider him to be the leading candidate to take over the top job at India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, next year when the current governor, Duvvuri Subbarao, retires.

The son of an Indian diplomat, Mr. Rajan grew up around the world and in New Delhi, earning degrees from prestigious Indian universities before studying economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His first big policy job came when he was appointed the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund. Since 2008, he has been an external adviser to Mr. Singh, who is his highest-placed champion in India and who also asked him to lead a committee to propose changes to the country's financial system. Mr. Rajan has made no secret of his distress with the slow pace of change in the country in recent years. But friends and associates say he believes that policy makers now feel under pressure to speed up the country's transition to a more liberal economy because growth has slowed sharply ahead of the next national election scheduled for 2014.
* Today in On Tech: Imagine not living in Big Tech's world.
* Dollar Tree will raise prices to $1.25 by the end of April. ""At the end of the day, he sees a window here,"" said Kenneth Rogoff, an economist at Harvard University who was Mr. Rajan's predecessor at the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Chidambaram, the finance minister, said he had come to expect unvarnished advice from Mr. Rajan. ""I've known Raghu for quite some time,"" he said, ""and when he joined the office here I told him one thing: 'You are the adviser. You just tell us the truth.' I think Raghu will do exactly that. He will tell the people of India the truth."" In the interview, Mr. Rajan said he and Mr. Singh had discussed his return to India for several years. While he dismissed the speculation about the Indian central bank job, he said he saw his new position in the government as an ""open-ended opportunity,"" not a short-term stint. He says he put aside plans to write a book on democracy and capitalism to take his new job.

He is committed to teaching classes in the fall quarter in Chicago but plans to move to India full time in December. His wife and his son will join him at the end of the school year; he also has a daughter in college. ""I feel I owe something to the country,"" he said. ""Also, I think the chance of even having some small influence that helps, that is multiplied by 1.2 billion lives, it's such an immense opportunity."" Mr. Rajan said he would like to focus his efforts on three big themes: liberalizing India's financial system; making it easier to do business, particularly for entrepreneurs and manufacturers; and fixing India's dysfunctional food distribution system, which wastes a lot of food even as many of the country's poor are malnourished. But the Indian bureaucracy's resistance to new ideas, which he highlighted in his April speech, may well stymie Mr. Rajan, just as it did his predecessor, Kaushik Basu, an economist from Cornell University who was recently appointed the chief economist of the World Bank. Mr. Rajan needs to learn quickly ""on the job in a situation where learning is not very easy,"" said Rajiv Kumar, who heads the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and is a former Indian government economist. Mr. Rajan said he understood the risks but believed that India's policy makers had been more open to change than many critics acknowledged. He pointed out that despite significant initial opposition, including from the central bank, Indian officials have adopted many of the proposals from the committee he led, including allowing Indian banks to open branches in most of the country, though not in big cities, without the Reserve Bank's permission. ""The message from our report is that nothing in India will get done immediately,"" he said. ""It's by the time your report gets forgotten, becomes part of the woodwork, that it really starts having an effect.""","Raghuram G.

Health,'Straight-Up Fire' in His Veins: Teen Battles New Covid Syndrome,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/17/health/coronavirus-multisystem-fnflammatory-syndrome-children-teenagers.html,"In late April, there was this bulletin that was sent out by a pediatric health service in the United Kingdom. It just said we're noticing some kids, not very many. They seem to have these symptoms of inflammation. We don't really know what this is about. Some have tested positive for coronavirus. Some haven't. And it was just kind of saying we think we're seeing something. So I talked to my editors about it, and we were trying to figure out whether we should explore it more at that point. And we decided, well, we don't really know a whole lot. It seems like a small number of cases. We can't even say for certain that it's connected to coronavirus, and so we just kind of put it aside for a bit and watch it. And then I think a couple days later I got an email from a hospital in New York City. The person said we've got two cases of this syndrome that they've been talking about in the UK. If you want to talk to somebody, let us know. And that's how I got to know Jack McMorrow and his family in their apartment in Queens.

Well, they're kind of mystified. I mean, they've got this kid, and they know that he has a positive coronavirus test, but he doesn't have symptoms that kind of look like what they've come to expect from coronavirus. And at the same time, just that very morning they've had two or three other kids show up with the same symptoms, very similar symptoms. And those kids have tested negative for coronavirus. So they don't have a live coronavirus infection, but the doctors are wondering. And so they have another test in their toolkit. They have what's called an antibody test, which can tell you not whether you have the live infection right now, but it can tell you whether somebody has ever had coronavirus infection. And they think, let's just give these kids -- these other kids that test and see. And lo and behold, those kids end up being positive for coronavirus antibodies. And that means that all of these kids who are showing up with these mysterious symptoms that cannot be explained by anything else that doctors know have this one common denominator. They have all had coronavirus.

[READING JACK'S EMAIL] ""OK, I'll try to make this email quick, because I'm still in the hospital recovering. The complications of this virus have left me with pneumonia. And more serious than that, heart issues. A mild heart blockage, as explained by the doctors. This heart blockage is the main reason I'm not at home recovering right now, but rather in a cardio-monitoring room. ""As hard as it is to keep up with all of this and understand many aspects of these complications, because of how little they know of Covid, I have to say, once it came around to them talking to me about my heart and my systems, I'm confident that I was able to keep up with the conversation and understand what was wrong with me and what to do to keep fighting -- or rather, to keep my vitals in check. ""To summarize what I'm trying to say -- and this is the honest truth -- I would like to thank you for educating me as you did and for providing me the educational support to understand my body when I need to most. Because based off of my knowledge on my heart and circulatory system, I'm now able to work off of that knowledge and help myself understand the doctors and communicate to them. ""I don't want to drag this out, and I know I said that I'd try to make this short, but I really do have to thank you for educating me enough to know what I needed to know. I'm sorry for making this email so long, and I really feel bad for disturbing you on a Saturday night. But seriously, I'm genuinely thanking you for educating me as you did, and I look forward to seeing you on Zoom or in class if we return this school year. ""I hope your family and yourself stay safe.

Television,"Review: In One Last 'Deadwood,' the Future Prevails and the Past Endures",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/arts/television/review-deadwood-the-movie.html,"Early in ""Deadwood: The Movie,"" Alma Ellsworth (Molly Parker) lays eyes on Sheriff Seth Bullock (Timothy Olyphant) -- her former lover, now settled with his wife (Anna Gunn) and children -- for the first time in a decade. Seeing him again, she says, her voice tremulous, is ""as a dream might come alive to draw breath."" There is indeed something dreamlike, otherworldly, about seeing ""Deadwood"" return, after 13 years, with the long-rumored, oft-doubted completion of a story that was cruelly interrupted after three seasons. You want to reach out and palpate its wounds, that you might believe. But believe it. This briefly resurrected wonder, which airs on HBO Friday, looks like ""Deadwood,"" if grayer and touched by time. It sounds like ""Deadwood,"" the profane poetry and syntactic baroqueness of David Milch's prose preserved as if in 100-proof whiskey.

Where had we been, before last we slumbered? The original ""Deadwood,"" which ran from 2004 to 2006, was in the mold of HBO dramas that took a pulp genre, stripped off the gloss and applied a heavy coat of human stain. Unlike ""The Sopranos,"" ""Deadwood"" did not modernize its old-movie types. Just the opposite: Milch created idiosyncratic, quasi-Shakespearean dialogue (and monologues) that combined the diction of a print culture with the dirty funk of the frontier. It was productively alienating -- subtitles help -- in a way that imagined a world: language as landscape.

Looming over all was the saloonkeeper and man-about-crime Al Swearengen (Ian McShane), a curiosity among HBO antiheroes in that he served both as villain and a kind of order-keeping pragmatic figure in the gold-mining camp. The series's theme was how a settlement full of disorderly reprobates, exiles and rejects builds a society. Over the series, the balance of power shifted, threatened by the larger world's impulse to organize, consolidate, tame and monetize, which culminates, at the outset of ""Deadwood: The Movie,"" in the 1889 statehood celebration for South Dakota.

I am assuming here that you've seen the original series. If you haven't, I compel you to. It's aged well, maybe because it was so sui generis to begin with, and the movie will still be there when you're ready. (The movie does include the occasional refresher flashback, a device that broke the moment for me and won't do much to orient the non-viewer anyway.) If you have seen the series and plan a rewatch -- or at least a refresher Wikipedia visit -- I'd focus on Season 3. Its bloody events figure most prominently here, in the person of George Hearst (Gerald McRaney), the mining magnate, now a U.S. senator from California, who's in town to address the statehood festivities and add to his holdings. ""Deadwood,"" like ""Westworld,"" is an HBO Western set in the future. Its future just happens to be industrial-age America, and as the movie makes clear, the future has won. A train now stops at Deadwood. The wooden buildings have been replaced by brick and stone ( a change precipitated in real life by a massive fire).

And Hearst -- the relentless, mechanical face of the market, more brutal than any outlaw band for being organized and dispassionate -- is running telephone lines across the wilds. Al, who once bemoaned the disruptive ""imponderables"" brought by the telegraph, sees the phone as an abomination. ""A saloon is a sanctuary,"" he says. ""Any man worth the name knows the value of being unreachable."" But the old ways are passing, symbolized by the physical decrepitude of Al, whom McShane plays magisterially as a lion in very late December. His liver, ridden hard for decades, is rebelling, and his irascible doctor (Brad Dourif) orders him to quit drinking or endanger his life. If you know ""Deadwood,"" you know it is no spoiler that Al chooses the latter. The plot, such as it is, emerges almost halfway into the movie, with a murder whose consequences are, fittingly, never entirely resolved. But plot is less the concern of the movie, efficiently directed by Daniel Minahan, than sending off a phenomenal cast -- some of whom, like Parker, get less attention than others.

There is, as in the recent ""Twin Peaks"" revival, something uncanny about seeing so many characters return, weathered but in essentially the same circumstances; you'd think, over a decade, that more people would have come and gone. (The few additions include a newly arrived young prostitute, played by Jade Pettyjohn, who serves mainly as a looking-glass for characters to see their younger selves.) But then you see Olyphant's Bullock, a push broom mustache not hiding his volcanic lawman's choler; you see Weigert's Jane, expansive in her booze-pickled regret; you see Dayton Callie, who manages to stand out among a cast of standouts in his final scenes as the earthy, philosophical Charlie Utter; and muscle memory kicks in. It is, as Charlie says, ""like somebody snapped their fingers.""

Watching ""Deadwood: The Movie"" is like looking at a 19th-century photograph of a wizened historical figure whose heyday was before the invention of photography. It is not the picture we might have gotten in 2007, with one final, full season of ""Deadwood"" in its prime. But it is the ""Deadwood"" we can get now, and in a way it's all the more affecting for its willingness to confront the time that cannot be recovered. That, in a way, is the film's subject (made the more poignant by Milch's diagnosis of Alzheimer's). ""The future awaits,"" Hearst says, in a moment of impatience. ""Stall progress ye may. Stop it, ye cannot."" All true. And yet, ""Deadwood: The Movie"" shows no one, even a titan blessed with a mountain of gold and backed with the terrible might of the U.S. government, can take your memories.","David Milch's filthy poem of the West returns, abbreviated and gray at the temples, but true to what it was.",381df2fb-0552-5250-98d3-047fac27764d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/31/arts/31deadwood-skybox/31deadwood-skybox-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=aed73d0810171c2a11f5160f34ee7c6e40ad31856b6d702aaa1e8f2e6da4626b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ian McShane in ""Deadwood: The Movie,"" debuting Friday on HBO.

Opinion,Why Do We Have an Electoral College Again?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/opinion/sunday/electoral-college-supreme-court.html,"Who elects the president of the United States? In a democracy, that shouldn't be a trick question. Thanks to the Electoral College, it seems like one. The American people cast their ballots on a Tuesday in early November, but on a national level that vote is legally meaningless. The real election happens about six weeks later, when 538 presidential electors -- most of them average citizens chosen by local party leaders -- meet in their respective state capitals and cast their ballots. Nearly always, the electors vote for the candidate who won the most popular votes in their state. But do they have to? That's the question that the Supreme Court has agreed to answer in two related cases it will hear this spring. The cases -- one from Colorado and one from Washington -- raise an alarming prospect: Can presidential electors vote for whomever they please, disregarding what the voters of their state said? More than 160 ""faithless electors"" have chosen to go this route since the nation's founding, a tiny fraction of all electoral votes in history. But the issue has become freshly relevant because of a concerted effort to persuade dozens of Republican electors in 2016 to switch their votes to prevent Donald Trump from taking the White House. In the end, 10 electors voted or tried to vote for someone other than their state's popular-vote winner -- the most in a single election in more than a century. (In 1872, 63 electors went against their pledge to vote for Horace Greeley, the Liberal Republican candidate, but that was because Greeley died shortly after Election Day.) Even though faithless electors have never come close to changing the outcome of an election, more than two dozen states have passed laws requiring their electors to vote for the state's popular-vote winner. Some punish those who don't, while others replace faithless electors with ones who will do the job they pledged to do.

Last May, the Washington State Supreme Court ruled that the state had the power to impose a $1,000 fine on its four faithless electors, on the ground that the Constitution gives the states total authority to decide how to appoint their electors. Three months later, a federal appeals court in Denver went the opposite way, ruling that the founders clearly intended for electors to act independently and vote according to their consciences, not to the dictates of any political party. Once a state appoints an elector, the court said, its power over that elector ends. They cannot punish someone, or replace him or her, for voting a certain way. The Constitution doesn't include any explicit guidance on the matter. So who's right? In a way, they both are. The framers of the Constitution, and the states that ratified it, clearly expected electors to vote as they pleased. In Federalist No. 68, Alexander Hamilton wrote that electors would be men ""selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass"" and ""most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations."" And yet, the Electoral College has almost never worked that way in practice. Less than a decade after the Constitution was drafted, the framers' idea of an independent elector was effectively kaput. As soon as national political parties took shape, elections became a partisan competition, and it was only logical that electors would start to take sides. In the election of 1796, electors were already pledging themselves either to John Adams, the sitting vice president and Federalist, or to Thomas Jefferson, the former secretary of state and Democratic-Republican. When one elector pledged to Adams changed his mind and voted for Jefferson, Federalists were outraged. One wrote, ""Do I choose Samuel Miles to determine for me whether John Adams or Thomas Jefferson shall be President? No, I choose him to act, not to think.""

That's been the operating assumption ever since, and it is almost never questioned. Even the term ""faithless"" is revealing: What faith is an elector who votes his or her conscience breaking? Didn't the founders intend electors to be faithful above all to the country? Yes -- and yet they are not now and essentially never have been. For this reason, however the Supreme Court resolves the issue, which it will do by early summer, little will change in practice. Political parties and their candidates, who currently choose their own slate of electors in each state, are already careful about selecting people for their partisan loyalty. That selection process will only become stricter if the court rules that states may not interfere in any way with electors' votes. And faithless electors are unlikely to affect the outcome even if the Electoral College tally is very close, as it was in 2000, when as few as three Republican electors could have broken their pledges and handed the presidency to the Democratic nominee, Al Gore, who won the most votes nationwide. None did. That makes sense. Americans would rightly revolt if a handful of people they'd never heard of ignored their votes and decided the election for themselves. It's almost as if we believe that we, the people, should be voting directly for the president -- the only official whose job it is to represent all of us equally, wherever we live. Which raises the question of why we still have an Electoral College at all.",A pair of new Supreme Court cases reveal a foundational flaw in how we pick the president.,38592a61-0cfe-50c0-a050-85b2cf7b6bb9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/25/opinion/25electoralWeb/25electoralWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=496102f3d8f9d05c30116c26da27bf6d3a8976823d0b4027a63f0b3467433b4c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Demonstrators appealing to electors from Pennsylvania before their vote in 2016.,38592a61-0cfe-50c0-a050-85b2cf7b6bb9,N24News/imgs/38592a61-0cfe-50c0-a050-85b2cf7b6bb9.jpg,11
Fashion & Style,Paris Fashion Week: The Final Day With Louis Vuitton,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/10/fashion/paris-fashion-week-louis-vuitton.html,"PARIS -- The shoes they bought new at the outset are scuffed and covered in Tuileries dust, their spirits are trampled and visions of puffa coats and velvet swim before them even when their eyes are closed. But congratulations to you, weary show-goers: You've made it to Fashion Month's final day.

There are only a handful of shows on the agenda before the crowds disperse. Starting the morning is Louis Vuitton at 10 a.m., once again at the palatial Fondation Louis Vuitton in the Bois de Boulogne. Vuitton always trucks in a handful of its favorite starlets. Might Alicia Vikander, the Swedish actress, Vuitton campaign star and newly minted Oscar winner be among them?

At noon, Moncler takes over the Grand Palais's Salon d'Honneur for its Gamme Rouge show, designed by Giambattista Valli, who juggles his multiple collections (for Moncler, for his namesake label, for the secondary collection Giamba) with seeming ease. (Though odds are, at the end of this fashion week, he'll be even more tired than the attendees).

The day finishes up with Miuccia Prada's Miu Miu at 2 p.m., the hip little sister to Prada's Milanese lady. It was a banner show for Prada lo these two weeks ago. If Miu Miu repeats the trick, it'll be a fine grace note to end the season.",Weary showgoers also can see Moncler Gamme Rouge and Miu Miu before heading to the airport.,ed924f62-a356-569c-ab15-f36ab6cda100,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/09/fashion/09-FW-MORNING/09-FW-MORNING-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=3408bd48d6e79ca2ea2b74d908d68fb5b4c0bc085078b82f04b9019bfdae6a88&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"What to expect from the last day of Paris fashion week.

Sports,"With Women's Hockey in Flux, League Says It Will Play in 2021",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/sports/hockey/nwhl-postpone-season.html,"The National Women's Hockey League announced plans on Wednesday to postpone the start of its season from November to January, becoming one of the first North American professional leagues to move its schedule to 2021 because of the pandemic.

According to Anya Packer, director of the N.W.H.L. Players Association, the decision was reached by the league's safety committee weeks ago. That panel of about 20 members includes infectious disease experts, league executives and members of the players' association who have had calls every two weeks since the committee's formation in April.

The league said it would make decisions about medical protocols, ticketing and arena capacity for fans before the start of the season. ""Our decisions are directed by science and driven entirely by safety,"" Michelle Picard, the league's deputy commissioner, said in an email. ""In a pandemic, you're not thinking about being opportunistic as a business. We're doing what's best for the players, staff, fans, media, and everyone in the communities where we play our games.""

This was to be a year of expansion for the league, which added a Toronto franchise in April. The N.W.H.L. said it still hoped to run a 20-game regular season, with each team playing two games over 10 consecutive weekends.

Travel,"In Basque Spain, a Pintxos Bar With Touches of Latin America",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/travel/basque-spain-pintxos-bar.html,"Late on a Saturday night in San Sebastian, in Spanish Basque Country, crowds spilled out of the crammed, loud pintxos bars that hold such a prominent place in the city's culinary scene, like Borda Berri and Atari Gastroteka, and into the cobblestone alleyways of the Parte Vieja, or Old Quarter. Just across the Urumea River, on a quiet street in the more residential Gros district, Topa Sukalderia, which opened in February, was about to sit its last customers for the evening.

Owned by Andoni Luis Aduriz -- whose restaurant Mugaritz in Errenteria, in the hills outside of the city on the Bay of Biscay, is considered among the world's best (it holds the No. 9 spot on the San Pellegrino list) -- Topa appears to have little in common with the city's boisterous tabernas serving these Basque-style tapas. For one, it serves tacos. Indeed, each pintxo featured a shared connection between the foods of Latin America and Basque Country -- and the merger proved rewarding dish after dish.

We ordered nearly half the dishes, which numbered around 20 options plus a few daily specials, and they came out one by one when ready. A rich 1,000-day mole, created with a starter sent over by Enrique Olvera (who made famous his version of that dish at his acclaimed Mexico City restaurant Pujol), and fed with Basque espelette peppers, packed plenty of heat, even when slathered on freshly ground tortillas. That mole showed up again on a taco filled with chipirones en su tinta, a regional dish of baby squid cooked in their own ink.

The crossover of cultures and techniques continued. A tiradito in the Nikkei tradition (which combines Peruvian and Japanese influences), rather than being made with a firm white-fleshed fish like sole, used plump anchovies; a Peruvian causa was layered with a regional preparation of txangurro, or spider crab. Even a mojito, called a euskojito here, was made with the slightly effervescent white wine txakoli instead of rum.","Topa Sukaldería, in San Sebastián, celebrates the shared connection between the foods of Latin America and Spanish Basque Country.",bbc50349-ae6b-5567-8f02-cc994f43a82b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/05/travel/05bites/05bites-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=43d615e02aeac56ed28d0bd1ec4770afe9080da8f415808210d6156d9ce6b26f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Basque-style al pastor tacos at Topa Sukalder&iacute;a in San Sebasti&aacute;n.,bbc50349-ae6b-5567-8f02-cc994f43a82b,N24News/imgs/bbc50349-ae6b-5567-8f02-cc994f43a82b.jpg,4
Health,"M.R.I.s Can Better Detect Cancer in Women With Dense Breasts, Study Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/health/dense-breasts-MRI-cancer.html,"Many women who have mammograms get normal results that come with a caveat: They are told they have dense breast tissue, which can make their scans harder to read and could leave cancer undetected. Sometimes those patients are advised to follow up by getting ultrasounds or magnetic resonance imaging (M.R.I.) scans, but for many, it is unclear what their next step should be. Now, a new study provides strong evidence that supplemental M.R.I.s are more effective in finding tumors in these women than mammograms alone. The study, of more than 40,000 women with extremely dense breasts in the Netherlands, found that those who had mammograms followed by M.R.I.s, had more tumors detected than with mammography alone. The research also found that those who had M.R.I.s were less likely to find a palpable cancerous lump in between routine screenings; by the time tumors are big enough to be felt, they tend to be more advanced.

The study, the first large randomized controlled trial of supplemental M.R.I.s in women with dense breasts, was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday.  Women with dense breast tissue have a higher risk of developing breast cancer than women with more fatty breast tissue. Dr. Wendie Berg, a professor of radiology at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and chief scientific advisory for DenseBreast-info.org, said the study's finding were ""very important."" ""The standard practice of mammography alone is not adequate for women with extremely dense breasts,"" Dr. Berg said, adding that her own cancer was detected early enough to require minimal treatment because her family history led her to seek an M.R.I. ""Women should be advocating for increased access to screening M.R.I.,"" she said. But though the study results were significant, it is still unclear whether supplementing mammograms with M.R.I.s ultimately reduces breast cancer deaths.

""The ultimate test of the value of M.R.I. screening"" in these women will be ""whether it improves survival -- an answer that we will not have for a very long time,"" cautioned Dr. Dan L. Longo, a deputy editor of the New England Journal and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, in an editorial accompanying the study. For all the promise, there is also a downside to using M.R.I.s for breast cancer screening: They yield many false positive results that lead to unnecessary biopsies, and they can detect very early stage tumors that might never become life-threatening, said Carla van Gils, senior author of the study and a professor of clinical epidemiology at University Medical Center Utrecht. Nevertheless, Dr. van Gils said, the significant reduction in interval cancers -- cancers that are diagnosed after a negative mammogram -- suggests supplementary M.R.I.s may be a lifesaving tool for women with dense breasts. ""It's not the same as mortality, but it's the first step. It's a prerequisite,"" she said, adding that the study is ongoing, and mathematical models will be run to make further predictions about mortality and overdiagnosis. ""There are more questions that need to be answered."" [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Only about 10 percent of women have extremely dense tissue like the women in the Dutch study. But having dense breast tissue generally makes it harder to see tumors on a mammogram because both the dense tissue and the tumors show up white on an X-ray. Fat, on the other hand, shows up black, so tumors are easily seen. The Dutch study, called DENSE (Dense Tissue and Early Breast Neoplasm Screening), is a multi-center, randomized controlled trial of 40,373 women between the ages of 50 and 75 in the Netherlands, all of whom have extremely dense breast tissue and had a normal screening mammogram. Scientists randomly invited 8,061 of the women to undergo a supplemental M.R.I., while the remaining 32,312 had only the mammography. Though only 59 percent of the women invited to have an M.R.I. accepted the offer and had the additional screening, 16.5 additional cancers were detected for every 1,000 women who had an M.R.I.

That in itself was not surprising and had been demonstrated by earlier studies. The researchers were more interested in another question: Did the supplemental M.R.I. screening catch so-called interval cancers that would become symptomatic before the next routine screening, two years hence? Their analysis found that it did. Among the women in the study who had an M.R.I., the rate of interval cancer detection was 0.8 interval cancers per 1000, far less than the rate of interval cancers in the mammography-only group, which was five per 1000. Many states now require that women having mammograms be informed that their breast tissue is dense when they get the results, and the Food and Drug Administration is developing similar guidelines. But there is little to no guidance on what women given the information should do about it. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not recommend routine use of additional tests after mammography in women who do not have symptoms or other risk factors, though many patients are referred for a supplemental scan. ""The takeaway is that there is no one perfect screening test, and each patient's perspective on the best course of treatment needs to be considered,"" said Dr. Marisa Weiss, founder of breastcancer.org, an educational resource for patients.","A large study found that M.R.I.s detected tumors missed by mammograms, cutting interval cancers by half or more.",889c93d6-41af-55e4-b534-b449e44d3401,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/27/science/27BREAST/27BREAST-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=f572ce941b5ad065d01695d419a4e74084fdd7d75a953affc826f2f5914bac0f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Just under half of women over the age of 40 have dense breasts, which means their breasts have more connective and fibrous tissue than usual, and relatively less fat.",889c93d6-41af-55e4-b534-b449e44d3401,N24News/imgs/889c93d6-41af-55e4-b534-b449e44d3401.jpg,1
Fashion & Style,"For Interracial Couples, Growing Acceptance, With Some Exceptions",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/26/fashion/weddings/for-interracial-couples-growing-acceptance-with-some-exceptions.html,"When I was a new mother living on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in 2010, I often forgot that my infant son, Harper, didn't look like me. As I pushed him around the neighborhood, I thought of him as the perfect brown baby, soft-skinned and tulip-lipped, with a full head of black hair, even if it was the opposite of my blond waves and fair skin. ""He's adorable. What nationality is his mother?"" a middle-aged white woman asked me outside Barnes & Noble on Broadway one day, mistaking me for a nanny. ""I am his mother,"" I told her. ""His daddy is Filipino."" ""Well, good for you,"" she said. It's a sentiment that mixed-race couples hear all too frequently, as interracial marriages have become increasingly common in the United States since 1967, when the Supreme Court's decision in Loving v. Virginia struck down laws banning such unions. The story of the couple whose relationship led to the court ruling is chronicled in the movie, ""Loving,"" now in theaters. In 2013, 12 percent of all new marriages were interracial, the Pew Research Center reported. According to a 2015 Pew report on intermarriage, 37 percent of Americans agreed that having more people marrying different races was a good thing for society, up from 24 percent only four years earlier; 9 percent thought it was a bad thing.

Interracial marriages are just like any others, with the couples joining for mutual support and looking for ways of making their personal interactions and parenting skills work in harmony. Yet, some interracial couples say that intermarrying, which in the past was often the cause of angry stares and sometimes worse, can still bring on unexpected and sometimes disturbing lessons in racial intolerance. Christine Cannata, a 61-year-old retiree, and her longtime African-American partner, Rico Higgs, 68, recently moved from Atlanta -- where their relationship sometimes attracted unwanted attention -- to Venice, Fla., a predominantly white city where they say neither one feels like anyone blinks at their relationship. Both are enormously grateful for the acceptance their families have shown them, and talked about how Ms. Cannata's grandchildren treat Mr. Higgs as if he is a blood relative. They're an older couple, they're in love, and no matter who the crowd is, Mr. Higgs is always the life of the party, Ms. Cannata says. Looking back at their time in Atlanta, however, the pair recalled how they sometimes drew stares in the airport, and how Mr. Higgs had been stopped by the police of that city for what Ms. Cannata said was no apparent reason. One time, officers pulled them over three blocks from their house; they wanted to know what he was doing in the car and asked to see his identification.

""When you love someone, it's hard to watch them be treated differently,"" Ms. Cannata said. While they are happy in Venice, Mr. Higgs admits that sometimes, if they're running an errand together, such as getting something notarized at a bank, he'll wait outside, just to keep the tellers from asking suspicious questions because he's black. Ms. Cannata feels badly when he does things like that, but Mr. Higgs says, ""It always makes things go smoother."" Katy Pitt, a 31-year-old consultant in Chicago, recalled being at a party in the months after her engagement to Rajeev Khurana. During a conversation with an acquaintance, the man, who was intoxicated, said: ""So you're getting married? Wow! When did you realize that he wasn't a terrorist?"" Ms. Pitt, emboldened by his ridiculous comment, looked him square in the eye, she said, and told him, ""I think what you meant to say was congratulations on your recent engagement."" While moments like this don't often happen to them, the couple, now newly married, say that their mixed marriage has played a bigger role than they thought it would in deciding what kind of community they want to be a part of and where they want to raise children. Mr. Khurana, a 33-year-old corporate and securities lawyer, is the product of a biracial marriage himself (his father is Indian, his mother is half Filipino and half Chinese). And as of late, he's feeling less certain that he wants to stay in Lincoln Park, the upscale Chicago neighborhood where they now reside. It was Ms. Pitt's idea to start househunting in more diverse areas of the city. ""If we have kids, we don't want our kids growing up in a homogeneous area where everybody looks the same,"" Mr. Khurana said. ""There's something to be said about interacting with people from different backgrounds.""

People of some races tend to intermarry more than others, according to the Pew report. Of the 3.6 million adults who wed in 2013, 58 percent of American Indians, 28 percent of Asians, 19 percent of blacks and 7 percent of whites have a spouse whose race is different from their own. Asian women are more likely than Asian men to marry interracially. Of newlyweds in 2013, 37 percent of Asian women married someone who was not Asian, while only 16 percent of Asian men did so. There's a similar gender gap for blacks, where men are much more likely to intermarry (25 percent) compared to only 12 percent of black women. Some people admit that they went into an interracial relationship with some faulty assumptions about the other person. When Crystal Parham, an African-American lawyer living in Brooklyn, told her friends and family members she was dating Jeremy Coplan, 56, who immigrated to the United States from South Africa, they weren't upset that he was white, they were troubled that he was from a country that had supported apartheid. Even Ms. Parham doubted she could date him, although he swore he and his family had been against apartheid. As they fell in love, she kept reminding him: ""I'm black. I check African-American on the census. It's my identity."" But Mr. Coplan reassured her that he was unfazed; he was falling for her.

Sports,1969: We Have Liftoff in Queens,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/27/sports/baseball/mets-1969-season.html,"Credit...Associated Press





The season began with a loss to the brand-new Montreal Expos, the Mets' eighth straight opening-day defeat. And the situation grew only worse. At the end of April, the Mets were 9-11. On May 27, they were 18-23, in fourth place in the National League East. Off in the distance were the first-place Chicago Cubs. But the next day, the Mets beat San Diego, 1-0, in a game in which Jerry Koosman struck out 15 batters. That began an 11-game winning streak that left the Mets -- yeah, the Mets -- with a record of 29-23. The revolution was on. In early July, the Mets had their first showdown with the Cubs, and Tom Seaver came within two outs of a perfect game. A week later, the Mets took two out of three at Wrigley Field. The Mets were now in second place, just four games out of first.

Hodges was sending a message, but the Mets kept struggling. By mid-August, they were 10 games out. And then, with Woodstock being staged in the background, the Mets took off. They swept the Padres at Shea in two weekend doubleheaders and began a run in which they would win 38 of their last 49 games of the season, sometimes in stupefying fashion. There was, for instance, the delirious Aug. 30 game in San Francisco in which the Mets threw out runners at home in the eighth and ninth innings along with another runner at third and then won in the 10th on a home run. A week later, Manager Leo Durocher and his swooning Cubs arrived at Shea, and the Mets beat them twice, with fans sarcastically serenading Durocher and with a black cat running in front of the Chicago dugout. The next day, the Mets moved into first. Two days later, they won a 1-0, 1-0 doubleheader in Pittsburgh. The starting pitchers drove in both runs. Three days later, the Mets struck out a record 19 times against Steve Carlton in St. Louis. But so what? They won, anyway, with Ron Swoboda hitting two two-run homers.

Following are excerpts from New York Times articles in 1969. Scaling new heights again, the New York Mets climbed past the break-even point and into second place in the National League East by beating the Los Angeles Dodgers, 5-2, at Shea Stadium tonight. Two home runs by Ed Kranepool, a well-placed misplay by the Dodgers, Tom Seaver's eighth pitching victory and Tug McGraw's second save marked the historic occasion, which also stretched the current winning streak to six games.

In 1966, and again this year, the Mets won two of their first three games; but in 1966, they lost the next five and this year they lost the next four. Never again did they have more victories than defeats until now, when their record stands at 24-23. LEONARD KOPPETT It has taken them 7 1/2  years, 439 victories and 771 defeats, but today the Mets finally begin an important series. At 2:05 p.m. at Shea Stadium, they start a three-game series with the Chicago Cubs, the only team ahead of them in the National League's Eastern Division.

The Mets were loose and confident going into the game because their best pitcher was going to work. The 24-year-old, right-handed Seaver, a fine athlete, had won 13 games and lost 3. But two hours later, the Mets and their fans wanted much more than victory No. 14. They wanted perfection and the first no-hitter by a Met, and they cheered madly for every Cub out. The first batter in the ninth was Randy Hundley, the experienced catcher. He tried to bunt a high pitch, but the ball rolled to Seaver's right and Seaver threw Hundley out at first. The fans, ever sensitive, booed Hundley for having tried to bunt Seaver out of a perfect game. The 22-year-old Qualls, a switch-hitter batting left-handed in his 18th major league game, was the next batter. Seaver wanted to keep the ball outside to him, but the pitch strayed a little too close to the plate and Qualls stroked it solidly to left-center, nowhere near Cleon Jones or Tommie Agee. GEORGE VECSEY Moon or the Mets? In Bars, It's the Latter The moon didn't figure in the conversation -- mostly in Spanish -- at the Full Moon Bar and Grill at 161st and Broadway. The bar was recently renamed La Luna Llena. It's owner, Richard Hauseman, was asked why the customers weren't following the moon shot on television. ""What's there?"" he retorted. ""Walter Cronkite talking -- that's all."" The television sets were on at most other bars, but not for Walter Cronkite or the astronauts. In Chicago, the Mets were ahead of the Cubs, suggesting a miracle that even Jules Verne did not foresee. A bartender was asked whether his customers were more interested in the Mets or the astronauts.

12 Wins in 13 Games as Mets Close on Cubs Jerry Koosman pitched the New York Mets to within two games of first place tonight as he overpowered the San Diego Padres, 4-1, with a two-hitter for the Mets' sixth straight victory. He allowed the two hits in the first inning but no more the rest of the game and he faced only 31 batters -- four more than the minimum. The Mets continued past another milestone on their remarkable road several hours after the first-place Chicago Cubs had lost again to the Cincinnati Reds. And by the time the Mets had finished their work tonight, they were all even with Chicago in games lost, and the Cubs' lead in the Eastern Division rested solely on the fact that they had played -- and won -- four more times. The victory was Koosman's third in a row, and the Mets' 12th in their last 13 decisions, while the Cubs were dropping eight of 10. It also was No. 74 for the Mets this season, one more than the record total they achieved all of last season, and it was their 11th in a row over San Diego.

The situation at the top of the Eastern Division was growing so sticky that Ernie Banks even telephoned long-distance to San Diego tonight. JOSEPH DURSO The New York Mets survived three hours of thrills -- and sometimes terror -- and defeated the San Francisco Giants, 3-2, on a 10th-inning home run by Donn Clendenon. The victory ended the Giants' winning streak at nine games and kept the Mets 3 1/2 games behind the first-place Chicago Cubs, who beat the Atlanta Braves, 5-4. Clendenon put the finishing touches to the Mets' afternoon by hitting a 2-1 pitch from Gaylord Perry over the right-field fence with two outs. But he did it only after the Mets lived through two wild innings in the eighth and ninth, during which the Giants put five runners on base -- and the Mets threw two of them out at home plate and one at third base. JOSEPH DURSO The New York Mets -- the urchins of baseball for the last seven years -- shook down the thunder from the sky tonight when they overpowered the Chicago Cubs, 7-1, before 58,436 persons in Shea Stadium. It was the fourth straight victory for the Mets and the sixth straight defeat for the Cubs, and the urchins moved to within a half game of first place in the National League East with three weeks to go. The Mets, who have never finished higher than ninth, made the tumultuous scene last night on the five-hit pitching of their prodigy, Tom Seaver. The 25-year-old Californian allowed four singles, one double and one walk, and achieved his 21st victory in the gaudiest season of pitching in Mets history.

They also added half a game to their lead over the Chicago Cubs in the National League's Eastern Division. The Cubs ended an eight-game losing streak tonight when they beat the St. Louis Cardinals, and they now trail the Mets by 2 1/2  games with less than three weeks to go. Three pitchers limited the Pirates to eight hits and no runs in the doubleheader. In the opener, Jerry Koosman pitched a three-hitter and, in the second game, Don Cardwell allowed four hits for eight innings and Tug McGraw gave up one in the ninth. In both games, the starting pitchers also batted themselves to victory -- Koosman with a single off Bob Moose in the fifth inning, and Cardwell with a single off Dock Ellis in the second inning. As a result, the Mets added these features to their high-flying caps with only 18 games left: They won their 24th and 25th games of 31 played since Aug. 13, when they trailed the Chicago Cubs by 10 games; they won their 21st and 22nd shutouts of the season, and their third in a row, and they extended their recent string of shutout innings to 34. JOSEPH DURSO Steve Carlton of the St. Louis Cardinals set a major league record tonight by striking out 19 New York Mets. But the Mets still won the game, 4-3, on a pair of two-run home runs by Ron Swoboda and extended their lead to 4 1/2  games with 15 to play. Carlton, a 24-year-old left-hander, struck out the side in four of the nine innings as he surpassed the record of 18 strikeouts set by Sandy Koufax, Bob Feller and Don Wilson. He even fanned Swoboda twice, on his first and third times at bat. But on his second and fourth trips to the plate, the Maryland muscleman drove home runs into the left-field seats, both times with a man on base, both times with the Mets trailing by one run.",The Mets overcame a slow start and a stagnant summer to run away with the division.,8dcac118-3d27-5e66-a3e8-1b3d6d51e10e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/28/obituaries/archives/28mets-1969-nohitter/28mets-1969-nohitter-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=ee0cde58b30aea8908fbe65abcbc3f886e8ff0f13590471d6427156de0a47570&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The scoreboard at Shea Stadium showed no hits for Chicago as Tom Seaver pitched to Ernie Banks of the Cubs on July 9.

Science,America's Gray Ghosts: The Disappearing Caribou,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/04/science/endangered-caribou-idaho-british-columbia.html,"At last count, there were about 1,354 mountain caribou in 15 subgroups in southern British Columbia.

BONNERS FERRY, Idaho -- The only caribou left in the contiguous United States are here in northern Idaho where they number about a dozen and live deep in the forests of the jagged Selkirk Mountains, near the Canadian border. Because they are so rarely seen, the caribou -- America's version of reindeer -- are known as gray ghosts. They may very soon become real ghosts: These animals are among the most endangered species in the lower 48 states. ""Right now, predation is the biggest problem, primarily wolves and cougars,"" said Norm Merz, a wildlife biologist with the Kootenai Tribe of Idaho, which has contracted with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to create a plan to revive the population. Not that long ago, hundreds of the animals lived in the United States. Part of the problem is that the Selkirk herd is international. The caribou can be found in the snowy old-growth forests of Idaho and extreme northeast Washington, but spend about 90 percent of their time in southern Canada. The threat to the animals there is so serious that Canadian government sharpshooters began killing wolves from helicopters. In the Selkirk Mountains, they have killed just 19 so far.

The Selkirk herd is not the only one so greatly imperiled. At last count, there were some 1,354 mountain caribou in 15 subgroups in southern British Columbia. Ten years ago, there were thousands. Today, all are in steep decline and listed as endangered in Canada, primarily because of wolves. Wolf predation, though, is a symptom of a much bigger and far more difficult problem. The fundamental cause of the caribou decline is the unanticipated ecological consequences of development. The steep mountain forests where the caribou dwell are part of an inland temperate rain forest, a unique ecosystem characterized by frequent precipitation and the only one inland. The centuries-old cedar and hemlock trees, and the lodgepole and whitebark pines in the high country, are home to a lichen that the southern herds of so-called deep-snow caribou depend on.

For decades, the forest has been fragmented by clear-cutting, road building, oil development and mining. Where the forest has grown back, it is dominated by willows and other small trees favored by moose, deer and elk. In 2009, wolf numbers began surging in southern British Columbia, northern Idaho and northeastern Washington, drawn to the abundant prey. The population of mountain caribou dived, including the Selkirk herd, which then numbered about 50. Wolves focus primarily on moose and deer, but in the last two years, wolves have killed two caribou in the Selkirks; cougars killed another one. Yet another was killed by a car on Highway 3 in Canada, where salt on the road lures wildlife.

Canadian government hunters have killed entire wolf packs in the caribou's range to keep the species from extinction. Government experts and some environmentalists say the wolf populations can easily withstand such aggressive hunting; some research suggests the culling actually stimulates wolves to reproduce more. Drastic measures to protect the mountain caribou have also led to ""maternity penning"" -- pregnant caribou are moved into a fenced enclosure that keeps predators out until the calves are old enough to fend for themselves and, hopefully, escape the wolves. There are many other caribou around the polar region, among them the famous herds of tundra caribou that thunder across the Arctic. But the caribou at risk in southern British Columbia and northern Idaho are the last known to climb the wintry peaks of the Rocky Mountains in search of dangling strands of lichen called Old Man's Beard.

Deep-snow caribou are burly, muscular ungulates, in shades of gray, white and dark brown, with unusually large antlers sweeping backward. They weigh as much as 600 pounds and have hooves the size of dinner plates, specially adapted keep them atop the many feet of snow at these elevations, where there are no predators. Protection for the caribou is controversial in the United States partly because snowmobilers want to ride on the public lands that were to have been set aside for the endangered species. In 2012, the Fish and Wildlife Service proposed to set aside more than 375,000 acres of critical habitat for the caribou. Opposition to the plan forced officials to reduce that to some 30,000 acres. The Pacific Legal Foundation, on behalf of the Idaho Snowmobile Association, has petitioned the federal government to have the 12 remaining animals delisted as endangered on the grounds that there are others in Canada and that these are not genetically distinct. But the Selkirk population is cut off from the hundreds of relatives farther north, primarily by roads, environmentalists say. Restrictions on snowmobile use and development in caribou habitat, they add, should be more rigorously enforced. ""It seems to me the U.S. federal and state governments have written off caribou,"" said Joe Scott, the director of international programs at Conservation Northwest, an environmental group in Washington State. ""If you are serious about protecting and restoring caribou, why are you shrinking their habitat down to the size of a postage stamp?"" As it stands, the Selkirk herd will not survive, and biologists say augmentation of the population is desperately needed. But with caribou in steep decline throughout their range, officials elsewhere don't want to give up animals.","A herd in the Selkirk Mountains near the Canadian border is down to about a dozen, threatened by wolves and a larger problem: development.",81df0cbc-ff5a-5fb2-ae0c-a539f180d2c0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/01/science/01CARIBOU3/01CARIBOU3-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=1ae9d5cb87843aaa1a542cffa040ab861553a7d9afa8ec5271e9971bd6d3ac60&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A large bull mountain caribou in late fall in British Columbia, Canada.

Automobiles,"Rarely Spotted, but Ready for Flight",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/automobiles/autoreviews/rarely-spotted-but-ready-for-flight.html,"WHAT IS IT? A mildly less responsible version of the latest Accord family sedan. HOW MUCH? $24,140 to start; as tested, $33,140. WHAT MAKES IT RUN? A 185-horsepower 2.4-liter 4-cylinder or a 278-horsepower 3.5-liter V-6. HOW QUICK IS IT? Enough to take so-called sportier cars by surprise. IS IT THIRSTY? Mileage ranges from an E.P.A. rating of 26 m.p.g. in town and 35 highway for the base engine with a continuously variable transmission to a worst-case 18/28 for a manual-shift V-6. FLASHING its bright red plumage, the bird that flitted onto my street one late-autumn morning was from a rare species.

First, this was a generously proportioned two-door coupe, an infrequent sight in a country that prefers family cars that have four doors. Second, this coupe had a manual transmission, adding grace to its thrumming V-6 heart. Finally, this was a Honda -- not drab, gray and common, but in return-to-Capistrano form, a class leader that even the most cynical spotter might call handsome. Between Japan's tragic tsunami and the company's seeming complacency, Honda has been in a funk, demoted from its first-string status in design or innovation. Models like the CR-V crossover wagon remain top sellers, but too many of Honda's makeovers have come across as placeholders, not the trendsetters we've come to expect. Whatever was ailing Honda, the new Accord is a remarkable return to form, both as bread-and-butter sedans and the dessert course of coupes. Flinging the sweetened coupe around New York, snicking its delightful shifter, I was reminded of some of the best-driving Hondas (the CRX Si, for instance) and Acuras (the Integra). Sure, Accords have always driven well. But the coupe reminded me that design and materials matter more than ever; that a graceful exterior and expensive-looking cabin can make a car seem revolutionary even when it's not. Whoever drew the Accord Coupe deserves a pay raise. Dual character lines tango down the sides. Tasteful brightwork highlights kinked rear window frames, tented by a graceful radius of metal. The rear end, with its swelling lip and trunk lid, is the kind of complex-to-manufacture shape once reserved for luxury cars.

If I remained unconvinced, the motorists who rolled down their windows to praise the car sealed the case: ""How's it drive?"" a man driving alongside shouted. ""It looks great, a lot like an Audi A5."" A Honda that looks like an Audi? I hadn't heard that one before. The haphazard air that permeated the interior of the previous-generation Accord has also been banished. Replacing it is one of the smartest cabins in the class, with well-shaped seats and gauges that mimic the dials of a chunky chronograph. With Honda's optional LaneWatch, flicking the right turn signal activates a camera to bring up a view of the right-hand lane. Displayed on the navigation screen, it's the sharpest high-res image I've seen in an automobile, and it seems tailor-made for safeguarding Manhattan bicyclists lurking in the blind spot. There's still a bit of Honda's hall-monitor feel, with tedious screen menus and layers of redundancy that can seem like overkill. A smaller, optional HondaLink touch screen, below the main eight-inch display, connects smartphones via USB cable to manage Internet media. But when HondaLink isn't in use, its screen is wholly redundant to the main display. Trimming about two inches from the sedan's length and wheelbase, and an inch in height, the Coupe loses some practicality: rear legroom shrinks by five inches and the trunk is about 15 percent smaller. Yet this is still a spacious midsize car, a grown-up's version of the buzzier, cheaper compacts of old. This is the quietest, most solid Accord yet, a plush cruiser that becomes pleasingly taut and composed through curves. And once the children are snug in bed, parents can relive their wilder years -- especially if they have chosen the 278-horse V-6. Car and Driver hustled the V-6 Coupe from 0 to 60 m.p.h. in 5.6 seconds, quick enough to match 6-cylinder Mustangs or Camaros. The coupe offers more frugal 4-cylinder versions with either a manual or a continuously variable transmission. Manual-shift V-6 models do without the fuel-saving cylinder-shutoff system found on automatic V-6 Coupes.","The new Accord is a remarkable return to form for Honda, both as bread-and-butter sedans and the dessert course of coupes.",4d345455-e310-5f8f-8a2e-3bcf5ffbaff8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/01/06/automobiles/06BLOC/06BLOC-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=300&w=600&s=60a5b02c0f6793dfee2e0921eca215dfa3f93e6b464cb968bfe84e5d61e638b7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,FRESH START The Honda Accord Coupe has been upgraded inside and out for 2013.,4d345455-e310-5f8f-8a2e-3bcf5ffbaff8,N24News/imgs/4d345455-e310-5f8f-8a2e-3bcf5ffbaff8.jpg,23
Music,Review: A Tiny Garage Explodes in Pianistic Madness,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/arts/music/spectrum-ethan-iverson-miranda-cuckson.html,"Chatter about the future of classical music tends to focus on major orchestras and opera companies, and how they can entice new audiences. But there has always been another layer of activity -- call it the classical music underground -- in which dedicated artists and curious audiences gather in small, offbeat spaces for adventurous programs.

One of the smallest and most offbeat is Spectrum, across the street from the Brooklyn Navy Yard; it still has the look and feel of the garage it used to be. But with a Steinway grand piano and a high-tech sound system for electronic music, it has become a go-to place for contemporary fare. (Spectrum moved here last year from its original location in a loft on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.)

On Sunday evening, the violinist Miranda Cuckson, a champion of new music, and the pianist Ethan Iverson, also a composer and best known for his acclaimed work in jazz, played an engrossing program of duos and solos, as part of Spectrum's Modern Piano (+) Festival, running through Sunday.

Sports,"LeBron James Passes Michael Jordan, a Player He'll Always Be Chasing",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/sports/lebron-james-passes-michael-jordan-scoring.html,"LeBron James was fouled on this layup attempt but managed to convert the shot, thus passing Michael Jordan for fourth place on the N.B.A.'s career scoring list.





There was no Instagram post celebrating the achievement in advance this time. There was relatively little buildup from the news media. It was an event that might have dominated the news cycle in years' past, but when LeBron James passed Michael Jordan on the N.B.A.'s career scoring list on Wednesday night, it was a triumph that somehow had been reduced to a footnote. James came into the Los Angeles Lakers' game against the Denver Nuggets needing 13 points to surpass Jordan for fourth place on the career list. With 5 minutes 38 seconds remaining in the second quarter, he managed to force his way to the basket for a layup, giving him 14 points for the game and 32,294 for his career. For good measure, he was fouled on the play. After a short stoppage to acknowledge the moment, play resumed as the Lakers, clinging to the last shreds of their playoff hopes, tried their best to overcome a huge early deficit at home against a heavily favored opponent.

James, who has taken the brunt of the criticism for the Lakers' failings in a difficult first year in Los Angeles, had acknowledged the pending accomplishment in a tweet shortly before the game, but was measured when discussing it with reporters earlier in the day. ""I take all accomplishments as they come,"" he said. ""Any time I'm in the breath with any other greats -- and obviously M.J. being the guy that I looked up to my whole life, the guy I admired as a kid -- I think it's going to be pretty cool."" Jordan, who owns the Charlotte Hornets, issued a brief statement on Thursday, saying, ""I want to congratulate LeBron on achieving another great milestone during his amazing career."" The statement was notable mostly for being far more succinct than the one he issued when Kobe Bryant passed him on the career scoring list in 2014. One would hardly have guessed from either man's words that the greatest current basketball player had just surpassed his idol in their sport's signature statistic. The inability for James to truly celebrate the moment was yet another indignity in a season full of them.

It was a little more than a year ago when James had seemingly settled into a groove. He scored his 30,000th point -- a feat he congratulated himself about on Instagram hours before he actually accomplished it. With that hurdle cleared, and with recent championship runs in Miami and Cleveland under his belt, his march toward challenging Jordan, then Bryant, then Karl Malone and maybe even Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the N.B.A.'s career scoring leader, seemed as if it would come without the criticism that had followed him earlier in his career.

A decision -- a loaded word when it comes to James -- to move to an ill-prepared Lakers team in the off-season has changed the calculus altogether. The team was predicted by most to struggle to make the playoffs in the West thanks to its collection of too-young players and veterans who do not complement James. Nevertheless, many have labeled the year a disappointment by virtue of the team's struggles despite having James, a player whose presence has seemingly guaranteed a finals appearance for close to a decade. As a result, James and the people around him have not been able to take much joy in his accomplishments. Just last week he passed Andre Miller to move into 10th place in career assists, thus making him the only player currently in the top 10 in both career points and assists. That feat -- it had been temporarily attained by only a handful of other players going back to the days of Bob Cousy -- was met with a collective shrug. It is a reality of James's life that he acknowledged on Wednesday. ""I haven't really appreciated anything I've been able to accomplish because I'm so engulfed in what's next,"" he said. ""How I can continue to get better; how I can help this franchise get back to where it needs to be."" An occasional season of missing the playoffs is not unusual for most players -- even the great ones -- but to capture how truly rare it would be for a James-led team, consider that he has played double-digit playoff games in each of the last 13 years. He has appeared in nine N.B.A. finals -- winning three -- and as a result his career rankings among playoff performers come off as outrageous, even for someone as accomplished as James.

Those rankings almost certainly will not improve this year. But among the more interesting aspects of James's current predicament is the opinion among many Lakers fans that the team's struggles have resulted in James's failing to live up to Bryant's legacy. Those criticisms ignore the fact that the Lakers' current six-year run of missing the playoffs included three seasons in which Bryant was still with the team. In fact, when Bryant passed Jordan on the career scoring list in 2014 -- a feat considered a big enough deal at the time that a road game in Minnesota was stopped for several minutes so the crowd could give him a standing ovation and the Timberwolves' owner could present him with the game ball -- the Lakers were only 8-16 and, partially a result of a season-ending injury to Bryant later in the year, were on their way to a 21-61 record.

But in one of the endless parallels between the careers of Jordan and James, players who will be debated long after both are gone, Jordan, who passed Wilt Chamberlain for No. 3 on the career scoring list in 2003, also found little joy in what should have been a huge accomplishment, largely because his Washington Wizards were a .500 team at the time. ""The thing about stats is they define you when you're 10 or 20 years past the game,"" Jordan said when asked to sum up his feelings on the accomplishment. ""While you're playing, what matters is wins."" James, who wears No. 23 because of Jordan, put a wristband on his forearm because of Jordan, learned to shoot fadeaways because of Jordan and pitches sneakers for Nike just like Jordan does, may want to heed that advice from Jordan in terms of coming back on his accomplishments later, even if they have to be put aside for now. The Lakers could never win another game and James, a player who still refuses to label himself a scorer, will always have more points than Jordan, the player who served as his inspiration on a path to greatness.","James's first season with the Lakers has been disappointing, but passing his idol in career scoring goes beyond winning and losing.",9bc0e9bf-f2bb-5b0b-86d2-9852228d346f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/07/reader-center/07score-hp/07score-hp-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=767d9d3dda2f542618a6f834110dd575de63a02d213edb4d1301c69c7731813c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,LeBron James passed Michael Jordan for fourth place on the N.B.A.'s career scoring list.,9bc0e9bf-f2bb-5b0b-86d2-9852228d346f,N24News/imgs/9bc0e9bf-f2bb-5b0b-86d2-9852228d346f.jpg,9
Travel,Hotels That Bring Sports Fans Close to Their Teams,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/travel/hotels-stadiums-atlanta-chicago-dallas.html,"A number of new hotels aim to allow fans to stay close to their favorite sports teams, encouraging tourism outside of game time.

For baseball fans, the new Omni Hotel at the Battery Atlanta is scheduled to open in early 2018, well before opening day for the Atlanta Braves, who play next door at the new SunTrust Park. The 264-room hotel will feature an elevated pool deck with views of the baseball stadium, which opened this spring. It is part of a larger development designed to include residences, office space and restaurants.

In Chicago, the new Hotel Zachary adjacent to Wrigley Field is also slated to open in spring 2018. The Ricketts family, who own the Chicago Cubs, are behind the hotel, named for Zachary Taylor Davis, the architect who designed Wrigley Field in 1914. It is poised to open with 175 rooms and branches of popular local restaurants, including Big Star and Smoke Daddy.

In time for football season, the 300-room Omni Frisco Hotel will join the 91-acre Star development, home to the Dallas Cowboys headquarters, the team's practice arena and two outdoor playing fields, in suburban Dallas.

We are living through the gravest domestic threat to our nation and democracy since the Civil War. I wish that were hyperbole, but it is fact. Never before has the president of the United States, cheered on by scores of his party's elected officials in Congress and statehouses nationwide, tried (and tried, and tried) to overturn the results of a free and fair election he indisputably lost.

It is a naked power grab that would make the most shameless and corrupt tinpot tyrant blush. It is so foreign to our country's most basic principles and values that it is difficult to comprehend that it is actually happening here. But it is happening, and it is terrifying. That the attempt appears likely to fail, and has been marked by buffoonish incompetence at every step, is cold comfort. Even buffoons (and their accomplices) can learn from their mistakes.

The Texas election lawsuit was a loyalty test, pure and simple.

President Trump and his many followers will remain a commanding presence in the Republican Party for the foreseeable future. He and they demand unadulterated loyalty; any elected Republican who doesn't support him wholeheartedly does so at the peril of his or her career. This consideration overwhelmed the logic of the case itself.

LONDON -- ""This is what we like: the ping-pong between New York and Hong Kong. We see them on the split screens in perfect clarity,"" the auctioneer Oliver Barker said late Monday, sounding like a prime-time TV game show host. He was taking seven-figure bids at a Sotheby's sale of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art, presented as a ""multicamera global livestream."" The marathon 74-lot auction at Sotheby's, which replaced the postponed May evening sales in New York, used the latest technology to try breathing life back into the pandemic-numbed top end of the international art market. The hybrid format featured the suavely suited Mr. Barker taking bids on a rostrum in an empty room in London, facing a bank of screens showing telephone-wielding colleagues in an adjoining room, as well as in New York and Hong Kong.

Mr. Barker deftly fielded online and on-screen bidding from across the world for almost five hours, alone in his London control room. Led by a Francis Bacon triptych, five works sold for more than $10 million, and at least eight artist's records were set.

""Sales are down across the board, but there's an incredible amount of wealth chasing the rarest of the rarest,"" said Wendy Cromwell, an art adviser based in New York. ""There's a real disconnect between who's hurting and who isn't. There's so much pent-up demand."" And so it proved. Sotheby's was fortunate to have secured at least three major consignments before the lockdowns imposed to fight the coronavirus pandemic made owners reluctant to sell high-value artworks via digital platforms. As lockdowns eased around the world, collectors and agents could view works by appointment in Hong Kong, London and New York. Several works had been widely published and exhibited, giving bidders further confidence.

Francis Bacon's imposing 1981 work ""Triptych Inspired by the Oresteia of Aeschylus"" had been exhibited since 1993 at the Astrup Fearnley Museet, a private museum in Oslo founded by the Norwegian collector Hans Rasmus Astrup. Dealers said the museum had been trying to sell the triptych privately for more than $100 million. But a more approachable valuation of $60 million at the Sotheby's auction encouraged a telephone bidder to give $84.6 million for the work, the third-highest price achieved for the artist at auction.

The $84.6 million Bacon was underbid online, and the $15.2 million achieved for a masterpiece-quality 1982 Jean-Michel Basquiat drawing of a head was not only a record for a work on paper by the artist, but was also claimed by Sotheby's to the highest price ever given by an online bidder at auction.

""This is a departure,"" said Guy Jennings, managing director of the Fine Art Group, a London-based advisory firm. ""As a result of this sale we may see much more confident online bidding at a higher level than we've seen before. There used to be a ceiling of a few hundred thousand on internet bids."" High-quality Impressionist and modern pieces were fewer and further between, as has been the case for several years, but a private collection of Latin American Surrealist paintings did spark intense competition. The stand out lot was the haunting, highly detailed 1956 ""Harmony (Suggestive Self-Portrait)"" by Remedios Varo. This set a new high of $6.2 million for the Spanish-Mexican artist, underlining the revaluation of women's contributions to the Surrealist movement.

Demand for works by long underappreciated female artists was a consistent theme of the evening. A group of 18 works from the estate of the pioneering Denver-based dealer and collector Ginny Williams kick-started the auction, grossing $65.5 million. All of them sold, with a new auction high for Helen Frankenthaler, whose ""Royal Fireworks,"" a spectacularly vibrant 1975 abstract, sold to a telephone bidder for $7.9 million, more than double the high estimate.","With a ""multicamera global livestream"" in place of its usual New York sale, the auction house tried breathing life back into a pandemic-numbed market.",d4691e30-0dfe-5bd9-a01b-9bfa446327c6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/30/arts/30auction2/30auction2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=36840c8c1eb1482513fd20e38ceeea63279035f291c0bb091e24ba1e3f10f2d8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left: ""Omi Obini"" by Wifredo Lam, ""Triptych Inspired by the Oresteia of Aeschylus"" by Francis Bacon and ""PH-144 (1947-Y-No.1)"" by Clyfford Still were among the works included an online auction at Sotheby's on Monday.",d4691e30-0dfe-5bd9-a01b-9bfa446327c6,N24News/imgs/d4691e30-0dfe-5bd9-a01b-9bfa446327c6.jpg,14

Released in the United States in 1947, Robert Montgomery's adaptation of a Raymond Chandler book took a novel approach by telling the story through Philip Marlowe's eyes, quite literally: Almost the entire movie is filmed from his point of view, so when Marlowe crawls away from a car crash, all we see are his hands. Not many movies have been shot this way -- the storytelling limitations of the device quickly become apparent -- but watching ""Lady in the Lake"" is a uniquely disorienting experience that ought to be undertaken at least once.

The United States centerpiece at this annual L.G.B.T.Q. film festival was popular with some critics at Sundance: Martha Stephens's black-and-white ""To the Stars"" (on Sunday) stars Kara Hayward (""Moonrise Kingdom"") as a mousy outcast in Oklahoma who becomes close with a newcomer to town (Liana Liberato) in the 1960s; the atmosphere is very ""Last Picture Show."" NewFest is also getting into the Halloween spirit with a special section that includes ""Scream, Queen! My Nightmare on Elm Street"" (about Mark Patton, star of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street 2,"" which some say contains a gay subtext), showing on Monday, and the vampire film ""Bit,"" on Saturday.

Education,Harvard Explains Why Staff E-Mails Were Searched,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/education/harvard-search-e-mail-accounts.html,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Harvard and its president on Monday made their first public comments on the university's searching of staff members' e-mail accounts, and offered a qualified apology for keeping the searches secret from most of the employees involved. The episode has angered faculty members and refocused attention on Harvard's largest cheating scandal in memory, which involved a take-home final exam in a government class last spring. After an investigation, about 70 students were forced to take a leave of absence. In September, when confidential information about cheating cases appeared in news reports, administrators ordered searches of the e-mail accounts of 16 resident deans, to find the source of the leaks. In an online statement posted Monday morning, university officials acknowledged the searches and explained their reasoning. The statement eased the concerns of some faculty members but did not alleviate them completely, and professors said they expected that e-mail privacy would be the topic of a full-throated discussion at the next faculty meeting, in early April.

In her first comment on the matter, Harvard's president, Drew Gilpin Faust, said that she did not know about the searches at the time, but that having been apprised, ""I feel very comfortable that great care was taken to safeguard the privacy of all concerned."" Faculty responses revealed a gap between expectations in academia, where privacy is often seen as integral to academic freedom, and the corporate world, in which employees are often told to assume that workplace e-mails are not private. Some professors wondered aloud whether they had been naive to think that things would be different at a university, and said they were forced to re-examine assumptions about confidentiality. ""It's disturbing because I don't know what it means about whether they could look at my own e-mail,"" said Oliver Hart, an economics professor. ""We need to have a discussion and a better understanding of the policy."" He and other professors said the searches would prompt him to conduct more business through private e-mail accounts outside of Harvard's reach. Most professors who agreed to discuss the matter on Monday insisted on anonymity, not wanting to run afoul of the administration. Several of them, conceding that the university had a legal right to conduct the searches, said the problem was, as one put it, that ""we never thought they would -- we never thought about it at all, and we probably should have.""

But the statement posted Monday, attributed to Michael D. Smith, dean of the faculty of arts and sciences, and Evelynn M. Hammonds, dean of Harvard College, said administrators were more troubled by another leak, recounting closed-door discussions by the Administrative Board. ""The disclosure of the document and nearly word-for-word disclosure of a confidential board conversation led to concerns that other information -- especially student information we have a duty to protect as private -- was at risk,"" the deans wrote. Resident deans live among students in Harvard's residential houses and act as student advisers, and they are also lecturers, meaning that they teach courses but are not on a tenure track to professorship. Each one generally has a personal Harvard e-mail account and one specifically for the job of resident dean. The deans' statement on Monday emphasized that the search was conducted only of the resident dean accounts, not personal ones, and only for the subject line on each message, to determine whether the confidential e-mail had been forwarded. The search determined that one resident dean had forwarded the e-mail to two students who were accused of cheating and had sought the dean's advice.

Deans Hammonds and Smith wrote that the resident dean who had forwarded the messages did so in good faith and was not punished. The statement did not say whether administrators determined how the e-mail found its way to the news media, or who was responsible for the other leak, of the Administrative Board's deliberations. That resident dean and one other were told about the e-mail searches shortly after they took place, administrators said, but the other 14 resident deans were not told until last week, after The Boston Globe inquired about the matter. They were not told to protect ""the privacy of the resident dean who had made an inadvertent error,"" Deans Hammonds and Smith wrote. ""We understand that others may see the situation differently, and we apologize if any resident deans feel our communication at the conclusion of the investigation was insufficient."" On his blog, Michael Mitzenmacher, a computer science professor, wrote that he was satisfied with some parts of the administration's explanation, but ""in my opinion, the administration made an error in judgment"" in not telling the resident deans of the search. Wilfried Schmid, a mathematics professor, said he still wanted to know more about what happened. ""I certainly get the sense that many of my colleagues will be upset, and so there will be a discussion,"" he said. But he urged the faculty not to lose sight of what he considered the bigger issue, the cheating episode itself.","The university offered a qualified apology for keeping the searches, which refocused attention on Harvard's largest cheating scandal, secret from most of the employees involved.",57761d78-67bb-556f-92ea-7262f97d8d5b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/03/12/us/HARVARD/HARVARD-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=2ce3180046fabfb4e1ad14654069e28301a8a79f7f81e4cc7909215386d294da&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Drew Gilpin Faust, the president of Harvard University.",57761d78-67bb-556f-92ea-7262f97d8d5b,N24News/imgs/57761d78-67bb-556f-92ea-7262f97d8d5b.jpg,22
Media,"Film Academy Trips Over Its Own Rules, Racing to Answer Calls for Diversity",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/business/media/film-academy-trips-over-its-own-rules-racing-to-answer-calls-for-diversity.html,"In announcing diversity-oriented institutional reforms after a special session of its governing board last month, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences got ahead of its own rules: In fact, some of the deepest planned changes have not met procedural requirements in the group's bylaws, and have yet to be enacted, a spokeswoman for the group acknowledged on Monday. A contentious move to purge the academy's Oscar-voting rolls of members who have not been active according to certain guidelines would not be affected by this procedural hiccup. At issue, however, is the academy's announcement on Jan. 22 that its 51-member governing board would ""immediately increase diversity"" by adding three seats, to which members would be nominated by the president, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, and confirmed by the board. Traditionally, nominees stand for election by the individual branches of the academy, such as the acting, directing and design branches, among others. The academy did not follow its procedural timetable for making that change. The hitch undercuts the academy's earlier announcement of what seemed a fait accompli -- significant structural changes meant to address a wave of criticism over its membership's lack of diversity. While it appears rather unlikely that the board will reverse course, it remains exposed to the possibility that a restructuring could fail to garner the two-thirds majority requirement for bylaws changes. That could happen if a substantial number of governors, besieged by member complaints, were to reverse what was described as a unanimous vote.

The procedural misstep also lends credence to claims by some that the sudden restructuring proposal was an ill-conceived public-relations maneuver meant to disarm a boycott call that was provoked by the announcement of an all-white slate of acting nominees for the second straight year. ""The 'sweeping changes' that the academy announced to increase diversity among members were anything but 'sweeping,' "" Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable, said in an email last week. ""The goal was to snatch lots of favorable P.R., give the appearance of change and make the protest go away,"" he said.

Changing the process of adding new board members requires a major revision of the academy's bylaws, which specify the board's makeup and electoral procedures. But any such revision, according to bylaws approved last June, can occur only by a vote of the membership, or at a governors meeting for which notice of particular changes has been provided at least 10 days in advance. That notice was not provided for the special meeting.

Now the board restructuring, and perhaps other changes, must pass muster at the board's next session, which will occur after the Oscar broadcast on Sunday. In acknowledging the need for another board vote, the academy spokeswoman, in a statement, said the two-step process was typical of action by private organizations and consistent with the adoption of ""prior amendments and resolutions.""
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions.
* $15 minimum wage for federal contractors will take effect Jan. 30. The academy's emergency session convened on Jan. 21, seven days after the Oscar nominations were announced, and left no time for full notice of a bylaws revision. As late as the day before the special meeting, people briefed on academy dealings, speaking on condition of anonymity because of confidentiality strictures, said the group would defer changes at least until a regularly scheduled board meeting, which occurred the Tuesday after. Those people also said the board would look more closely at Oscar balloting procedures than at deeper structural changes, at least for the moment. But as criticism of the academy's largely white membership and choices mounted, there was a push for immediate action, driven by Phil Alden Robinson, a governor and the academy's secretary, according to people briefed on the process. In an email on Saturday, Mr. Robinson, a writer and director perhaps best known for the film ""Field of Dreams,"" referred questions to other academy officials. ""I feel pretty strongly the academy should speak with one voice,"" he said.

The academy spokeswoman declined to address those deliberations. Less clear than issues around the restructuring of the governing board are issues that touch on a promise to add new members to internal committees. Each branch within the academy has its own executive and nominating committees; but the president is empowered to appoint the chairman of each committee, unless that power is assigned to another officer. The bylaws, as revised last June, do not specifically authorize Ms. Isaacs or the board simply to add women or minority committee members to bolster diversity. In announcing the board and committee changes on Jan. 22, Ms. Isaacs said the group's intention was ""to lead and not wait for the industry to catch up"" with diversity efforts. The statement also said the committee reorganization was intended to ""identify and nurture future leaders."" Those declarations were consistent with Ms. Isaacs' call, at a banquet in November, for an effort by the group to ""encourage and to push the industry to examine its hiring practices and to begin to make changes."" Still, the group, under existing bylaws, faces limits on steps that any of its officials might take to change industry hiring -- for example, a change motivated by the political leanings of one or more members. ""As the academy is nonpolitical, it shall take no part in public issues regarding economic, political or religious questions,"" reads one crucial bylaws provision. Under this provision, any two members of the governing board can table an action that is seen to represent a political view, or that might affect the economic interests of members in any labor dispute. The academy spokeswoman said the prohibition against dealing with economic issues barred involvement in labor disputes, but it does not prohibit ""taking a position on issues crucial to the industry's future."" Those, she says, are actually required by a mission statement, in the bylaws, that charges the group with ""shaping the future of motion pictures.""",A procedural misstep by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences lends credence to claims that the sudden restructuring proposal was an ill-conceived public-relations maneuver.,dfe0ea99-a602-51fb-83f4-e06d4fee8d91,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/23/business/media/23ACADEMY-1456185416918/23ACADEMY-1456185416918-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=3875ff98ae3eb7dc757b6c462fa3e903fac9d59d681c7dc0748a1c346b649d39&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A restructuring of the film academy's board must pass muster at its next session, which will occur after Sunday's Oscars broadcast.",dfe0ea99-a602-51fb-83f4-e06d4fee8d91,N24News/imgs/dfe0ea99-a602-51fb-83f4-e06d4fee8d91.jpg,16
Technology,Uber Board Stands by Travis Kalanick as It Reveals Plans to Repair Its Image,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/technology/uber-board-stands-by-travis-kalanick.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- The board of Uber is confident in its chief executive, Travis Kalanick, board member Arianna Huffington said on Tuesday, providing a show of support as the embattled ride-hailing company seeks to repair its reputation. Ms. Huffington made her remarks in a conference call with reporters that Uber announced only hours before. During the roughly 45-minute call, executives also laid out a multipart plan to get the reeling company back on track after a series of revelations about its business practices and internal unrest that have damaged its image. Of paramount importance, the company stressed, is Uber's search for a chief operating officer to help Mr. Kalanick. In addition, Uber is overhauling its human resources department, improving its relationships with drivers, and soliciting feedback from concerned employees. The company also plans to release a report on the diversity of its work force this month, and will conclude an investigation into its workplace culture by the end of April. ""The board is confident in Travis, and we are proceeding ahead with the search for the C.O.O.,"" Ms. Huffington said during the call. ""Put very simply, change starts at the top.""

Because Uber rarely puts together such calls for the news media, the one on Tuesday reflects how the company is working to seize control of its image after a rough start to the year. In recent weeks, Uber's reputation was badly damaged after a former employee published a scathing blog post detailing what she said was a history of sexual harassment and systemic issues in the company's human resources department. Separately, Uber faced criticism for its program to deliberately deceive law enforcement using a software tool called Greyball, The New York Times reported. Mr. Kalanick, who helped found Uber in 2009, also came under fire for how he had influenced the culture of the company. After a video of Mr. Kalanick arguing with an Uber driver recently leaked on the internet, Mr. Kalanick apologized and said he would seek leadership assistance. Several executives, including president Jeff Jones, have since left the company. Mr. Kalanick was not present during the conference call. Ms. Huffington, who joined Uber's board last year, was joined on the call by Liane Hornsey, the recently hired head of human resources, and Rachel Holt, the head of Uber's ride-hailing business in the United States and Canada. In the call, Uber said it expected that Mr. Kalanick would be highly collaborative with any executive hires. Bill Gurley, a venture capitalist and longtime Uber board member, is helping to lead the executive search for the chief operating officer, as is Ms. Huffington. Asked whether Mr. Kalanick would be willing to step down if asked, Ms. Huffington said the company's leadership has not discussed the ""hypothetical"" situation.

""It's clear that both Uber and the entire ride-sharing industry would not be where we are today without Travis,"" Ms. Huffington said. Beyond providing assistance to Mr. Kalanick, Uber said it had significant work to do to repair what appears to be a culture badly damaged by infighting and harassment. Ms. Hornsey said Uber had held more than 100 ""listening sessions"" with employees across the company, and had set up a hotline for anonymous complaints from employees for sensitive subjects. She also noted the recent hiring of a global head of diversity, Bernard C. Coleman III. Uber plans to publish its first diversity report breaking down the gender and ethnic makeup of its work force by the end of March. Uber also is working to change its feedback system in human resources, which many current and former employees had criticized as unfair and opaque. ""Too much time is spent looking backward rather than forward,"" Ms. Hornsey said of the system. ""We need to change it."" A companywide investigation into Uber's workplace practices, which is being conducted by Eric H. Holder Jr., the former United States attorney general, is expected to conclude by the end of April. Ms. Huffington said the company would honor the results of the investigation and abide by any changes recommended. Despite Uber's culture problems, Ms. Holt said the company's business remains healthy. Last week in the United States, riders took more trips with Uber than in any previous week, she said.","In a conference call with executives, Uber presented a list of changes it plans to make to improve morale and repair its tarnished reputation.",eda25e94-1095-5486-9da6-28a110e896c1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/22/business/22UBER1/22UBER1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=a9cbacf9e3bdeef057cd40affa53400456a620f223d7f54fd376ae6fee066ec4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"At a drivers' center in Long Island City, Queens, Uber employees helped future drivers with paperwork early this month.

Global Business,"Euro or No, Economics of Everyday Greek Life Is Eroding",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/business/global/economics-of-everyday-greek-life-is-eroding-euro-or-no.html,"LEVIDI, Greece -- Gregoris Skouros stepped out of the sawed-off cargo container that hard times have forced him to make his home in on an agricultural plain near this tiny village, a two-hour drive south of Athens. When a visitor raised the issue on everyone's minds -- Greece's future in the euro zone -- Mr. Skouros pursed his lips for a long moment before speaking. ""The problem has now gone beyond whether we remain in the euro or not,"" said Mr. Skouros, 54. ""The issue is, Can Greece be fixed?"" That question has taken on new urgency as Prime Minister Antonis Samaras makes a renewed effort this week to assemble an austerity budget package that can persuade Greece's creditors to release a 31.5 billion euro ($41.1 billion) loan installment for the country in October. Even now, auditors from Greece's troika of international lenders are examining the books in Athens to determine whether the country is on track to repair its tattered finances.

But even if Greece receives yet another lifeline from its European partners, many Greeks have reached their own conclusion: It doesn't matter. While the economics of everyday life continue to erode, the big concern is that Greece's leaders are doing almost nothing to root out deep-seated problems that hobble a return to growth, including bureaucracy and bribery. That dark public mood -- also evident in widespread work stoppages in Greece this week and a general strike planned for next week -- could make it all the harder for Mr. Samaras's government to push through Parliament his 11.5 billion euro package of austerity measures. A budget deal could be the country's last, best hope for getting the next round of international loans it needs to stay part of the euro union. Recognizing the domestic political challenges facing Mr. Samaras, whose shaky three-party coalition came to power in June after two national elections, European officials seem willing to give him a bit more time. European finance ministers meeting in the Cypriot capital of Nicosia last weekend signaled that willingness, and on Monday so did the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. Given the political alternatives in Greece, European leaders might see little choice but to continue betting on Mr. Samaras. Right now, in fact, it may be the increasingly impatient Greek public that is the prime minister's bigger challenge. The popularity of the neo-fascist Golden Dawn party, which won 18 parliamentary seats in the last election, has climbed in recent weeks. The main leftist opposition party, Syriza, is now virtually tied with Mr. Samaras's New Democracy party in the polls.

Mr. Skouros, who voted for the socialist Pasok party that was ousted from power this year, said he was no longer sure for whom he would vote if elections were held yet again. ""The problems of Greece are so widespread,"" he said, shielding his eyes from a blazing sun as he looked across the stretch of farm country that he now calls home. ""It would take a Marshall Plan with outside inspectors coming into every government operation and looking over people's shoulders to make sure that change really happens."" The Greek economy, already in the fifth year of recession, has slumped even further in recent months as a series of earlier state salary and spending cuts, together with sharp tax increases, take their toll on an austerity-weary public. Growth contracted 6.2 percent in the second quarter and is expected to decline nearly 7 percent this year, far worse than the 4.2 percent forecast just a few months ago by the so-called troika of international lenders: the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission. Unemployment rose to 23.6 percent last month.
* Today in On Tech: Imagine not living in Big Tech's world.
* Dollar Tree will raise prices to $1.25 by the end of April. With the Samaras government's latest proposals to cut state salaries and pensions even more, Greeks -- including doctors, firefighters and large swaths of the national police force -- have taken to the streets. So far the demonstrations have been peaceful. But some people are bracing for the possibility of civil unrest on Sept. 26, when a planned nationwide strike is expected to bring things in Greece grinding to a halt. While Mr. Samaras has promised that this latest austerity package will be the last round of cuts on his watch, critics say the bigger issue is that too little is being done to rehabilitate the competitiveness of the Greek economy or attract foreign investment. The troika has been signaling as much by insisting that the government take bolder steps to slim the bloated state sector; clamp down on waste, inefficiency and corruption; and reduce the thickets of administrative hurdles that stifle entrepreneurship in Greece.

Mr. Skouros agrees. Without fundamental changes, he says, Greece may have little hope of being anything more than a ward of the European state for years to come. He speaks from experience, having run the Greek gantlet when he tried to restart his life two years ago. That was after the elevator parts and service business he had owned and run in Athens for a decade began slumping along with the economy, after the extent of Greece's debt crisis became evident. He and his son, Tassos, 24, looked for ways to make a fresh start. After studying a variety of business prospects, Mr. Skouros moved in 2010 to this vast agricultural swath of Arcadia to set up a snail-farming enterprise. Escargots, it turns out, can be a lucrative export, snapped up by the truckload as a culinary delicacy by restaurants and shops in Italy and France. To save money, he settled into a trailer that he combined with half a cargo container to make his homestead on a small plot he bought, joining a rising number of urban Greeks who are returning to the countryside as jobs and business opportunities dry up in big cities. But Mr. Skouros faced obstacles from the get-go. Escargots might be a potentially lucrative cash crop, but banks would not take the risk of lending to him. And obtaining a business permit turned into its own 18-month odyssey, with numerous visits to government offices and the occasional request for bribes. ""In Greece, it has always been the case that you pay a bribe -- to get your driver's license, at the hospital, and even when starting a business,"" he said. ""Now things have gotten so bad, the trend has become even worse.""

He said the corruption and nepotism that the troika had also identified as hurdles to reviving the economy were all too apparent even here in rural Greece. In many agricultural regions, it is not uncommon for people with Civil Service jobs to grow crops on the side while continuing to collect their pay from the state. He spoke of one man who often tended to his tomato crop during the summer instead of going to work in the office where he was a civil servant. The tomatoes bring in an estimated 25,000 euros a year, much of it collected in cash to avoid paying full taxes. The local tax collector was a close friend of the man, ""so it's no wonder that full taxes are not imposed,"" Mr. Skouros said. ""In the meantime, this man is getting a paycheck from the state even while he is working in the field."" Mr. Skouros said he was not certain the Samaras government -- or any government, for that matter -- would be able to surmount the culture of corruption that taints even the most basic functions of Greek society. As it is, he said, the prime minister now seems more focused on an international audience than on his country's own voters, trying to forge the austerity plan that will placate the troika and begin repairing the international reputation of Greece. Fingering an escargot shell in his palm, Mr. Skouros said he still hoped his business would take off. But so far, given all the delays, he said he had not yet been able to start exporting or generating any revenue. He cast a long, silent stare across the farmland. Whether or not Greece stays in the euro, or gets yet another lifeline from the troika in the coming months, he finally said, corruption, bribery and bureaucracy are weighing on Greece even more than the debt on which outsiders are so fixated. ""Are we ever going to be able to change things?"" he asked. ""Probably not without a revolution.""","Even if Greece gets yet another lifeline from its European partners, many Greeks have reached their own conclusion: It doesn't matter, because of deep-seated problems.",1928a942-8e23-5faa-bf9a-13563db8dec7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/09/19/business/global/19greeks/19greeks-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=350&w=600&s=fb2ddcce0a4d83b476cf6076fab042b94c7bb05b86627dd3b773d8aab1f4db83&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Gregoris Skouros tried to restart his life two years ago as a snail farmer, but just getting a permit took 18 months.",1928a942-8e23-5faa-bf9a-13563db8dec7,N24News/imgs/1928a942-8e23-5faa-bf9a-13563db8dec7.jpg,24
Books,Prestigious Laura Ingalls Wilder Award Renamed Over Racial Insensitivity,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/books/laura-ingalls-wilder-book-award.html,"The American Library Association is dropping Laura Ingalls Wilder's name from a prestigious children's literature award in order to distance the honor from what it described as culturally insensitive portrayals in her books. The decision was made out of a desire to reconcile the award with the organization's values of ""inclusiveness, integrity and respect,"" representatives of the association said in a statement on Monday. The award is given out by its children's division. ""Wilder's books are a product of her life experiences and perspective as a settler in America's 1800s,"" the association's president, Jim Neal, and the president of the children's division, Nina Lindsay, said in the statement. ""Her works reflect dated cultural attitudes toward Indigenous people and people of color that contradict modern acceptance, celebration, and understanding of diverse communities."" Ms. Wilder's books, particularly the ""Little House"" series based on her childhood in a settler family, have remained popular since they were first published in the 1930s and 1940s. A hit television show based on the series, ""Little House on the Prairie,"" helped to reignite interest and usher in a new generation of fans in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

The name change was a result of months of consideration and was approved over the weekend by the board of the Association for Library Service to Children, a division of the library association. The honor, formerly the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award, is now named the Children's Literature Legacy Award. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

The award, distributed to just 23 people over more than six decades, recognizes authors and illustrators whose books have created a lasting contribution to children's literature. Wilder herself received the first award in 1954, three years before her death in 1957. It was initially distributed every five years, but its frequency has steadily increased. Since 2016, it has been given annually. Other winners include the authors Beverly Cleary; Theodor S. Geisel, also known as Dr. Seuss; and E. B. White. This year's winner, announced in February, was Jacqueline Woodson, the author of ""Brown Girl Dreaming"" and other books. Despite their popularity, Ms. Wilder's books contain jarringly prejudicial portrayals of Native Americans and African Americans.

In the 1935 book ""Little House on the Prairie,"" for example, multiple characters espoused versions of the view that ""the only good Indian was a dead Indian."" In one scene, a character describes Native Americans as ""wild animals"" undeserving of the land they lived on. ""Little Town on the Prairie,"" published in 1941, included a description of a minstrel show with ""five black-faced men in raggedy-taggedy uniforms"" alongside a jolting illustration of the scene. ""There's this subtle but very clear fear generated throughout the books,"" said Debbie Reese, a scholar whose writing and research focus on portrayals of American Indians in children's literature. Dr. Reese, who belongs to the Nambe Pueblo tribe in New Mexico, said that the books could be used to educate high school or college students, but were inappropriate for young children. ""People are trying to use them and say, 'Well, we can explain them,' and I say: 'O.K., you're trying to explain racism to white people. Good for those white kids,'"" she said. ""But what about the Native and the black kids in the classroom who have to bear with the moment when they're being denigrated for the benefit of the white kids?"" The American Library Association said that the name change was aimed only at aligning the award with its values, not at limiting access to Wilder's books. ""Updating the award's name should not be construed as censorship, as we are not demanding that anyone stop reading Wilder's books, talking about them, or making them available to children,"" Mr. Neal and Ms. Lindsay said in the statement. ""We hope adults think critically about Wilder's books and the discussions that can take place around them.""

In recommending that the organization move away from using Wilder's name for the award, a task force for the children's division noted last month that the books had been both ""deeply meaningful"" to some readers and ""deeply painful"" to others. ""Both of these things are true,"" it said in a written recommendation, adding that such a move would not demand ""that anyone change their personal relationship with or feelings about Wilder's books."" The task force also said that the books, and Wilder herself, were products of her era and reflected the mostly mainstream perspective of a white woman at the time.",The American Library Association said it renamed the prestigious award because Wilder's books do not reflect its inclusive values.,9a159c62-f2f4-5e8b-9bc3-fadf90b545b9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/27/nyregion/27xp-ingalls1/27xp-ingalls1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=22c6a476cdb40a215cce8a567054cdb0172707f6f93c1dad29b1266f80b250e4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The author Laura Ingalls Wilder, at 17.",9a159c62-f2f4-5e8b-9bc3-fadf90b545b9,N24News/imgs/9a159c62-f2f4-5e8b-9bc3-fadf90b545b9.jpg,13
Music,Jann Wenner Steps Down From the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/arts/music/rock-roll-hall-fame-jann-wenner.html,"In time, Wenner, who founded the Rock Hall with the record executive Ahmet Ertegun, became more associated with the institution than any other figure -- becoming its top negotiator in the industry, as well as the person blamed, fairly or unfairly, for its shortcomings. That role will soon come to an end. Wenner, 73, will step down as chairman of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Foundation on Jan. 1, the organization announced Wednesday. He will be replaced by John Sykes, the president of entertainment enterprises for the radio giant iHeartMedia, who was among the first executives at MTV.

""I just felt I had done what I set out to do,"" Wenner said in response to questions about why he decided to leave his post. ""That it had been built, stabilized and become well financed and managed -- and, after 30-plus years of running it, time for new energy, new ideas, a new generation."" Wenner's retirement is the biggest change to the management of the institution in its history, and it raises questions about how the Rock Hall will evolve under Sykes. Many critics have contended -- in sometimes detailed reports -- that the Hall has admitted too few women and people of color. In an interview, Wenner denied that, pointing to the Hall's history of inducting black pioneers of rock and R&B music, and saying that the induction process should not be influenced by such considerations. ""I don't think that's a real issue,"" Wenner said. ""People are inducted for their achievements. Musical achievements have got to be race-neutral and gender-neutral in terms of judging them."" According to Jon Landau, Bruce Springsteen's longtime manager and the chairman of the hall's nominating committee, Wenner's decision was driven in part by the need for a succession plan. Wenner, he said, nominated Sykes as his successor.

""It was a collegial and thoughtful process,"" Landau said in an interview, ""and was handled in a very fraternal way."" But things have never been entirely collegial at the Rock Hall, which was founded by Ertegun, of Atlantic Records, along with a team of music and media executives, including Wenner, Landau and Seymour Stein of Sire Records. Wenner became chairman after Ertegun's death in 2006. Since its earliest days, the Rock Hall has been pilloried as unnecessary or even contrary to the spirit of rock 'n' roll -- an elite museum for a youthful and rebellious art form -- and attacked for which artists its voters decide to include or exclude. Even those who get in have balked, as Steve Miller did in 2016, complaining about issues like inductees' licensing agreements. ""They need to respect the artists they say they're honoring, which they don't,"" he said. The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame began in 1983 as less of an institution than a concept for honoring rock's roots and elevating its heroes. It held its first induction ceremony in 1986 at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York, but did not open the doors of its museum in Cleveland until 1995. ""A long time ago, when no one was thinking about our music and its posterity,"" Mick Jagger said in a statement, ""Jann saw that we needed a place to celebrate popular music and recognize the people who had made the music grow. It was a visionary idea and he stuck with it.""

In time, the Rock Hall came to embrace other kinds of music, like hip-hop -- starting with Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, in 2007 -- and chart-topping pop singers like Madonna and Janet Jackson. For Wenner, who will remain on the Rock Hall's board, relinquishing control over that institution may be his final step in letting go of an extraordinary level of power and influence over pop culture. In 2017, Wenner sold the celebrity magazine Us Weekly to American Media Inc., the publisher of The National Enquirer. Later that year, he sold a majority stake in Rolling Stone -- the magazine he founded in 1967 with the music critic Ralph J. Gleason -- to Penske Media Corporation, which has since redesigned the magazine and pursued new features like a Rolling Stone-branded chart to challenge Billboard. Wenner retains the title of editorial director at the magazine. Reflecting on the twilight of his career, Wenner said he is working on a book, although he declined to offer details. He said seeing Rolling Stone and the Rock Hall passed to another generation brought him ""enormous satisfaction,"" and added, ""That's better satisfaction that to hold on to some bitter end.""",The longtime Rolling Stone editor helped found the Rock Hall in 1983 and became its public face.,cd2717d5-71fa-538f-9d0c-15d98ed182de,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/25/arts/25rockhall/25rockhall-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=9aa0bd7735090a053122a7a0b68afdad02cec9520eaf0fd16519f6985c5fcb95&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Jann Wenner at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction in 2017.

BOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA at Carnegie Hall (April 11-13, 8 p.m.). The Boston Symphony has been making marked strides under its music director Andris Nelsons, even if its programming seems a little aimless -- as these concerts demonstrate. The big night is Thursday, which gives New York audiences a chance to hear the tenor Jonas Kaufmann sing Tristan for the first time, in a concert performance of Act II of Wagner's ""Tristan und Isolde."" He appears alongside Camilla Nylund as Isolde, Mihoko Fujimura as Brangane and Georg Zeppenfeld as Marke. Wednesday's concert is made up of two current obsessions for Nelsons and the orchestra: Shostakovich, represented by his Symphony No. 4, and Bernstein, with his Symphony No. 2.

Media,"If Bernie Bernstein Existed, He'd Be a Terrible Journalist",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/business/media/bernie-bernstein-washington-post-fake.html,"If Bernie Bernstein were a real reporter, he would not last long at The Washington Post or any other legitimate news organization. Fortunately, he is not real. But an unknown number of people in Alabama got a call this week from a man claiming to be Mr. Bernstein, supposedly a reporter for The Post on a clumsy expedition to dig up dirt on Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for senator. Al Moore, a pastor in Creola who is not related to Roy Moore, played a voice mail from a private number to WKRG-TV, a local news station. Hi this is Bernie Bernstein. I'm a reporter for The Washington Post calling to find out if anyone at this address is a female between the ages of 54 to 57 years old, willing to make damaging remarks about candidate Roy Moore for a reward of between $5,000 and $7,000. We will not be fully investigating these claims however we will make a written report.

""The call's description of our reporting methods bears no relationship to reality,"" Marty Baron, the newspaper's executive editor, said in a statement. ""We are shocked and appalled that anyone would stoop to this level to discredit real journalism."" It should be noted that many people hear the heavily accented voice saying ""Lenny Bernstein,"" which is the name of a health reporter at the paper. The caller is not him.

We get it, a lot of people distrust the media and suspect the worst out of reporters. But here's what the call got wrong. Kris Coratti, a Washington Post spokeswoman, said the publication has a policy that specifically prohibits paying sources. (So does New York Times policy.)

'We will not be fully investigating these claims' That would be a very silly thing for a reporter to say. It would be like a plumber saying ""we will not fully fix the leak in your pipe."" ""A journalist worried about his or her reputation would only want to put verified or supported claims in a story carrying their names,"" said Andrew Seaman, the ethics chair for the Society of Professional Journalists.

An ethical reporter would also be unlikely to phrase their request the way the robocall did. Asking for someone ""willing to make damaging remarks"" would be brazenly partisan in a way most mainstream reporters try to avoid. ""Journalists wouldn't normally ask such leading questions,"" Mr. Seaman said. ""They're after the truth, whether that leads to a scandal or exoneration."" There's also the matter of the name itself. It seems intended to play into anti-Semitic sentiment.","A pastor got a call from someone pretending to be a Washington Post reporter.

Economy,"On Climate Change, Even States in Forefront Are Falling Short",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/business/economy/climate-change-california-new-york.html,"Is there a more environmentally conscious state than California? It has been at the forefront of climate policy for decades -- from demanding stringent fuel economy and emissions standards to wholeheartedly embracing renewable energy from the sun and wind.

 It has fighting words for the incoming administration of Donald Trump. ""We will not deviate from our leadership because of one election,"" the State Senate leader, Kevin de Leon, told The New York Times. Last fall, the state legislature committed to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent below their 1990 level by 2030. ""California is doing something that no other state has done,"" proclaimed Gov. Jerry Brown. State policies were always bound to play a central role in the decarbonization of the American economy. But with a president-elect who has asserted that climate change is a Chinese hoax, promised a bright future for fossil fuels and vowed to undo President Obama's climate strategy, their choices have become more important than ever. And yet for all the pluck of the Golden State's politicians, California is far from providing the leadership needed in the battle against climate change. Distracted by the competing objective of shuttering nuclear plants that still produce over a fifth of its zero-carbon power, the state risks failing the main environmental challenge of our time.

Mark Muro, director of policy at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, has compiled a ranking of progress toward decarbonization within the United States. In 2014, he found, California had the third-lowest carbon dioxide emissions per person, behind only the District of Columbia and New York. Its progress of late, however, has been less than stellar: Despite its aggressive deployment of wind turbines and solar panels, the carbon intensity of California's economy -- measured by the CO emissions per unit of economic product -- declined by only 26.6 percent between 2000 and 2014. That put it in 28th place. In New York, which came in seventh, carbon intensity declined 35.4 percent. It is not entirely California's fault. Persistent drought has drastically cut its supply of hydroelectric power. Still, the state's carbon emissions were also driven by its own choices: Added to the hydroelectricity slump, the 2012 closing of the San Onofre nuclear plant north of San Diego left a void in the power supply that even a vast increase in solar and wind generation could not replace. So it was mostly filled with natural gas.

But even a state like New York still has work to do. An analysis by PricewaterhouseCoopers argued that to ensure that the global temperature does not rise more than 3.6 degrees above its preindustrial average, which world leaders have agreed is the tolerable limit, the carbon intensity of the global economy must decline 6.3 percent per year between now and 2030. The United States must decarbonize at an annual rate of 4.3 percent under that timetable. But over the last decade and a half, only North Dakota and the District of Columbia have achieved this pace. New York is decarbonizing at about 3 percent per year, California at barely above 2 percent.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. What's more, most of the gains in the United States have come relatively easily, not from the deployment of renewables but from the wholesale switch from coal to cheaper and cleaner natural gas. Much of that transition has played itself out, however. Further gains will be more expensive. ""What's critical to think about is, Where are the next savings going to come from?"" Mr. Muro told me. ""Divergent state dynamics on nuclear energy will become a crucial issue in the next 40 years."" Taking nuclear energy off the table has already pushed the nation too far in the wrong way. Consider this bit of counterfactual history. Environmental Progress, an advocacy group that aggressively supports the deployment of nuclear energy to combat climate change, estimated what California's power sector would look like had the opposition from antinuclear forces -- including Governor Brown -- not undone the state's deployment of nuclear energy, starting in the 1970s. The power from San Onofre and the Rancho Seco nuclear generation station near Sacramento, both now shuttered, added to that from the never-built Sundesert nuclear plant in the Mojave Desert and three planned-but-not-built units at Diablo Canyon on the state's central coast, would add a total of 77,000 gigawatt-hours of zero-carbon power to California's supply. Only 27 percent of the power produced in California would come from fossil sources, other things remaining equal, as opposed to 66 percent today. And carbon emissions from power generation would be only 40 percent of what they are today.

There's a reason for that: Alarmed by the prospect of nuclear meltdowns and the potential damage to ecosystems and human health, voters remain decidedly against nuclear reactors. Still, if combating climate change is an imperative, nuclear power and its risks must get a more careful assessment. Climate change will be hard to stop without it. Consider Germany, which vowed both to replace its nuclear energy with renewable energy sources and to make great strides in combating climate change. Last year it got less energy from the sun despite having more solar panels than the year before. An 11 percent increase in wind capacity produced a 1 percent increase in wind power. And Germany's carbon emissions from energy rose. At several moments last winter, a high-pressure system reduced wind and solar power to a small fraction of total demand. What if this happened in 2030? About a third of German power comes from renewables, on an average day. Even if the Germans had three times as much renewable generation capacity, there would be periods when it wouldn't come close to satisfying demand. With no nuclear energy to speak of, the gap would have to be filled with fossil fuels. ""One cannot simultaneously rely on massive amounts of wind and sunshine, dispense with nuclear power plants (for very good reasons), significantly lower the supply of fossil energy, and nevertheless tell people that electricity will definitely be available in the future,"" noted the German economist Heiner Flassbeck. Unfortunately, it doesn't look as if America's governors and state legislators will take the lesson to heart.","States like California and New York have been leaders in curbing carbon emissions from energy. But to achieve their goals, both may need to embrace nuclear power.",3f32674d-841b-5567-8372-d626c5fac098,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/17/business/18porter1/18porter1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=b227f972754e431cd2a47ae0a2b9cc54fd06772f20c5a0d55e5ed302347574d3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Gov.

Your Money,Lessons From Another Storm,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/your-money/from-joplin-tornado-victims-advice-on-disaster-proofing-finances.html,"IF you didn't live through Hurricane Sandy and its aftermath, it's hard to fathom the extent of the destruction. Photos and videos go only so far. You simply cannot understand it if you haven't been through it. Unfortunately, plenty of Americans have been through it, in one form or another. And their empathy about the length of the recovery runs deep. ""I hope they don't get discouraged, because it does take a long time,"" said Raye Frerer of Joplin, Mo., where a tornado left a 14-mile scar last year. ""Here we are, 18 months later, and we're still not back in our home."" Even today, you can stand on what passes for a hill in Joplin's midsection, at 23rd Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, look east and look west and see empty space. The trees are still gone. Apartment complexes are gone. The hospital is gone. The high school is gone. That's what happens when an EF-5 tornado touches down, eviscerating everything in its path, as it did here on Sunday, May 22, 2011. Winds reaching 250 miles per hour tore homes and other buildings from their foundations and sent debris flying for miles, and 161 people died.

As Joplin's residents make their way through the stages of grief, they are eager to talk about it. They want to share how they survived and how they're preparing for the next one, because they now understand that this kind of disaster can happen to anyone, anywhere, at any time. We all know the risks, and we promptly learn to ignore them. After all, you can't function very well if you live in daily fear of disaster. But you can prepare yourself for the possibility, however remote, that something like what happened to the people of Joplin -- or New Orleans, or Northridge, Calif., or New York City and the surrounding areas last month -- will happen to you. And one of the easiest steps you can take is to disaster-proof your finances. The tornado here caused nearly $3 billion in damage. Some 61,000 insurance claims were filed, with a total payout of more than $2 billion. Of that, 31 percent went to homeowners and 5 percent to people who lost their cars and trucks. But many people did not get as much relief as they had expected. The long road back to financial wellness has been more difficult than it perhaps had to be. And those lessons have stayed with them. Ms. Frerer, 58, was at her mother's home south of Joplin that Sunday afternoon. They were celebrating Mother's Day a week late, and her mother, who is close to 80, looked out the window from a small breakfast nook and said, ""That's the blackest cloud I've ever seen!"" Ms. Frerer turned to her husband, Fred, and told him she didn't want to get her hair wet, so maybe it was time to head home.

Mr. Frerer, 60, is retired, and Ms. Frerer is a teacher. When they got to their house in Joplin, Mr. Frerer stood in the road to check the sky. When he came back in, he grabbed a twin mattress from one of the beds, and the two of them settled onto the floor of their small bathroom with the mattress on their heads. ""My chest started getting tight and my ears, all of a sudden they started popping,"" Ms. Frerer said. ""They must have popped hundreds of times. And I thought, 'Lord, what on earth am I going to do?' I thought, 'God, I'm prepared to meet you.' "" She had been through tornadoes before, and they usually sounded like freight trains. ""This one sounded like World War III,"" she said. ""You could feel it, almost like a cosmic tug of war between good and evil."" The house shook, objects pummeled the walls outside the bathroom, and then, as suddenly as it had arrived, the storm ended. They stood up from under the mattress and opened the bathroom door. Ms. Frerer could see that the nearby middle school had been destroyed, and she wondered whether there would be school tomorrow. Then she realized she shouldn't be able to see outside. ""I stepped into the hall, and the only part of that house still standing was the bathroom that we were in,"" she said. Money issues take an obvious back seat to the imminent possibility of death at moments like this. But they surface fairly soon after.

The Frerers were more prepared than many people are, and for that they credit Financial Peace University, the biblically tinged educational enterprise of Dave Ramsey, a nationally syndicated talk-radio financial adviser. One of the so-called baby steps Mr. Ramsey recommends is to set aside $1,000 where it is easily accessible. The Frerers had some of that amount stashed in a small safe in their bedroom closet. The closet wasn't there after the tornado, but the safe was. They kept another portion of the money in an envelope that ended up embedded in a vent. They remembered the cash a couple of days after the storm and were able to retrieve it. Disaster preparedness experts say cash is an important element of any emergency planning, because you don't know if banks will still be standing or if A.T.M.'s will be operational. But a common question is how much you should have on hand. Ted Beck, president of the National Endowment for Financial Education, suggests the same amount as emergency officials recommend for food and water: three days' worth. The Frerers also had homeowners' insurance. Ms. Frerer contacted their insurance company, State Farm, that first night as they took shelter nearby at her brother's house. She got through despite spotty cellphone coverage but had to leave a message when no one picked up. (With so many cell towers down, calls were hard to make. Text messages, she learned, were more likely to go through because they are shorter bursts of data.) She said one lesson she and her husband learned was that people should try to build a close relationship with an insurance agent, so the agent will try to contact them if a disaster happens. Another couple in their neighborhood had such a relationship, and six days after the storm, that couple had keys to a fully stocked temporary apartment. The Frerers spent the first few days staying with friends and family, trying to figure out what kind of financial assistance they would get from insurance and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. By the time they started looking for rental apartments or hotel rooms, there weren't any available. Ms. Frerer said another lesson was to go ahead and book something immediately after a disaster, assuming you can afford to front the money before seeking reimbursement from your insurance company. When the insurance adjuster arrived two days later, she gave the Frerers a check for about $1,000. Several weeks later, another adjuster told them they were about $30,000 short of what they needed to rebuild their home to what it had been. That was in large part because the cost of supplies and materials skyrocketed in the Joplin area after the storm. The couple looked into buying an existing house, but prices for those also went up because of high demand and diminished supply -- the tornado had destroyed 7,000 homes.

""My house was insured for more than the house down the street sold for six to nine months before,"" Ms. Frerer said, ""so I thought, 'Hey, we're good to go.' Well, not necessarily."" She said she had begun checking her insurance coverage yearly and making sure she understood every part of her policy. Mr. Beck, the National Endowment for Financial Education president, suggests doing this at the same time you do the annual check of smoke detectors in your home, so it becomes a habit. One bit of bureaucracy the Frerers came up against was the insurance company's demand for a detailed list of the contents of their destroyed home, including what they paid for each item, its current value and its replacement value. ""Like, I have 16 T-shirts or I have 22 pairs of whatever,"" Ms. Frerer said. ""What kind of toiletries, makeup -- I kid you not. The detail they wanted was overwhelming."" She had a receipt box for major purchases, but not for smaller items. And that box? ""It's probably blown across to Illinois by now,"" she said. Mr. Beck said that without receipts, the best way to prove what you owned was with photos and videos. Every year or two, walk around your house and take a detailed inventory of what you own. Put the videos or photos on a DVD or thumb drive and keep it in a safe deposit box or somewhere else outside your home, or store it online. You can also give copies to family members who do not live in your area. The Frerers are now living in a small rental while they build a new, large house less than a mile from the one that blew apart. The school district bought their old land for rebuilding. Because of the insurance shortfall, they are dipping into their savings and retirement funds. They say their financial recovery was helped by the fact that they had paid off their mortgage and had no debt. But Ms. Frerer's voice still catches when she thinks about how much worse it could have been. ""It makes us thankful for things that aren't financial,"" she said. ""I'm not going to dwell or think about what I've lost. We come from pioneer stock, so that's the way we want to live. We're just going to pull up our bootstraps and thank God for what he provides and get on with living.""

""I mention that as an important detail,"" Ms. Davison, 39, said. ""We moved into the house with a tragedy, and we left the house with a tragedy."" Joplin's warning sirens first sounded around 5:10 p.m. Ms. Davison said she didn't hear them. Mr. Davison, 42, texted her, ""Don't worry, we're in the basement,"" which alerted her to the coming storm. About 10 minutes later the sirens sounded again. She looked out the window and didn't see anything, and the radar on local television news showed what seemed like a small storm cell. But as a resident of Tornado Alley, imprudence was not her style. She and Emma, 12, moved to the one room in the house -- the laundry -- with an exterior wall and an interior wall between them and the direction the storm was coming from. They dragged in a large cedar chest, and Emma climbed in with a few stuffed animals and her iPod. Ms. Davison sat down next to the chest, placed her hand inside to keep contact with her daughter and hoped for the best. And then, the tornado was upon them. ""Trains are nothing compared to this sound,"" she said. ""You hear this ferocious thing just hitting your house, and you start to feel the walls moving. We were praying the Lord's Prayer. It sounds melodramatic now, because we were not injured in any way, but at that time I faced my death, and possibly the death of my child."" Emma started crying as rain began to fall on them -- on the first floor of a three-story house. They emerged to find a living room that opened to the sky, and a second-story staircase to nowhere. A van outside the house was decimated. In one bit of good news, they found all three of their cats unharmed. Ms. Davison's mother had always told her to get replacement cost insurance, as opposed to what is known as an actual cash value payment. With a cash value policy, the insurance payment is for what your home and its contents were worth before they were destroyed. Replacement cost insurance covers what it would cost to buy all of your belongings new, whenever you need to replace them. Replacement cost coverage is usually 10 to 20 percent more expensive than cash value coverage, but the Davisons chose that option through their insurance carrier, Horace Mann.

Their policy included an inflation guard that automatically adjusted to cover increases in rebuilding costs. That saved them from the gap experienced by the Frerers when construction materials became so expensive after the storm. The policy also included $10,000 worth of debris removal and demolition costs, as well as money to pay for a rental property, which they did not use because so many friends and family members opened their homes. Because the Davisons' insurance was so comprehensive, they moved quickly to buy another home. They didn't want to deal with all the decisions involved in building a house from scratch, and they didn't want to stay in their old neighborhood, where all the trees were suddenly gone. Within six weeks, they had a check in hand large enough to pay off their mortgage and to cover the full cost of the new home, which they got at a discount because they were able to pay cash. They also had some money to restock the new home, including with a few major appliances. Ms. Davison said people tended to forget about all the little things they own. ""Think about replacing all your spices at $3 or $4 or $5 a bottle,"" she said. ""When you have to start a whole house, you buy everything from scratch all at once."" The Davisons were also lucky that both of them were able to keep working. The church where Mr. Davison works sustained damage, but not enough to keep him off the job, and Ms. Davison's school was not in the tornado's path. They said the insurance payout involved a significant amount of paperwork, particularly when it came to buying the house, but it still took them only two months to get into their new home. For that, they praised their insurance company. Ms. Davison said that one important element of preparation was knowing how to get access to medications after a disaster. ""If you're going to put together a kit, one thing that would be really good to have is just the names of your prescriptions and how many milligrams you're taking,"" she said. This was a common problem faced by Joplin residents. Stephanie Brady, vice chairwoman of Joplin's long-term recovery committee, noted that many pharmacies, including the local Walmart, were damaged or destroyed, as was a hospital and several other large medical buildings. ""That was one of the big expenses that people had,"" she said. ""They've lost their prescriptions and they couldn't get a new one, an actual script, let alone have the money to purchase it again."" Ms. Davison said she wished she and her husband had thought to put shoes on as the tornado approached, and that would be a priority next time. They also now have a fire-safe box containing important household documents, after losing their college diplomas and marriage license in the storm. But even if they had done all of this before May 22, 2011, they said no plan would have been sufficient for what happened.

Carrie Cook, 39, works in the advertising department of the local cable television company. She was supposed to be cleaning her apartment that Sunday evening. An inspection was scheduled the next day, an annual walk-through that occurs in rental housing subsidized by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, as hers is. Instead, she had driven to her mother's house for dinner with her 9-year-old son, Zachary. As they arrived, the sirens sounded. She asked her mother if they should leave the area, but dinner was in the oven, so they decided to stay. Minutes later, Ms. Cook's ex-husband drove up with their other son, 7-year-old Aidan. ""He said, 'Everybody get in the car!' And he told my mom, 'You're coming, too,' "" Ms. Cook said. ""We got in his truck and drove to my dad's house, and as we were going into his storm shelter the fence and everything was falling down, so we were in the middle of it. It was right on us real fast."" After the tornado passed, they drove back to her mother's house. A trip that usually took 10 minutes took more than 30 because of downed power lines and other debris on the roads. Her mother's house was still standing, while others around it had been ripped from their foundations, but it was not habitable. Ms. Cook's car, still sitting in the driveway where she had left it, was destroyed. ""It looked like a bomb had blown off in it,"" she said. ""The windows were all gone, shot out."" She wasn't going to leave her mother there that night, so she suggested they all stay at the apartment complex. Instead, her father and ex-husband insisted on going alone to check on it. They made a videotape of that journey, and in viewing it again recently, Ms. Cook choked up. The top floor of the two-story complex was sheared away. Their first-floor apartment was uninhabitable. ""They had brand-new beds that my dad and their dad had just built for them,"" she said of her sons. ""They had those for one week. All you could see underneath was drawers of their pajamas."" Added Aidan: ""There was a Dumpster in our living room."" Ms. Cook said the calculation of what this could do to their finances started that night. ""When I saw the picture of my apartment and I had already seen my car, all that processing started,"" she said. ""I couldn't sleep. I immediately went into panic mode: 'Where are we going to live?' "" For the first few nights they stayed in hotels, courtesy of her mother's employer, and after that in a succession of apartments. The saving grace for Ms. Cook was that she had renter's insurance. A recent survey by the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group, showed that less than a third of renters in the United States purchased renter's insurance, despite owning an average of $30,000 worth of household goods. The Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America, another industry group, said the cost of insuring that amount of property was about $12 a month, which would also cover $100,000 worth of liability if someone were injured on the premises.

""I got my first check within five days,"" Ms. Cook said. And what led her to buy that insurance? ""I didn't get it because I was afraid of a tornado,"" she said. ""I got it because I couldn't control what anybody else did"" in the apartment building. Ms. Cook did not work for three weeks after the storm because her sons' day care had no electricity, and she was sorting through what little was left of the apartment. She said she still felt that she had been underinsured -- and the insurance she did have meant she did not qualify for FEMA assistance, despite repeated appeals for aid. FEMA's Individuals and Households Program provides grants of up to $31,500 for temporary housing and repairs, as well as replacement of some essential household items. But money paid out in the immediate aftermath of a disaster must be repaid once an insurance settlement is received, and any money FEMA provides as a supplement to insurance is only for repairs to an existing home, not for the cost of rebuilding one. Like Ms. Frerer, Ms. Cook found it difficult to complete the required inventory statement. ""I had to remember what else I'd lost, such as my grandmother's ring that I'd gotten as a sweet 16,"" she said. ""It was difficult to remember, it was depressing and it was time-consuming."" She had also opted for full coverage on her car, instead of just liability, even though it was paid off. That meant another insurance check that covered the cost of an equivalent used car. Ms. Brady of Joplin's long-term recovery committee said the lack of adequate vehicle coverage was a significant issue for a lot of lower-income families that carried only liability insurance. She said that 18,000 vehicles were damaged or destroyed and that public transportation wasn't available for two weeks after the storm. ""So a lot of people lost their jobs because they couldn't get to it because they didn't have that transportation, and it just compounded the situation,"" she said.

Like the Frerers, Ms. Cook is a follower of Dave Ramsey, the talk-radio financial adviser, and she did have some cash hidden in a piece of furniture in her apartment. That was one piece that was still intact after the storm came through. It wasn't a lot, but at that point every dollar was helpful. She said she was able to get through the first few months in large part because of the kindness of strangers. ""People from everywhere donated money,"" she said. ""They'd hand you a Bible and it had $20 in it. They would just come up to you and give you gift cards."" Ms. Cook recently moved into one of 65 homes that Habitat for Humanity is building this year in Joplin. She said getting the house was ""a work of God."" She filled out an application after the storm, and the organization sent someone to interview her family. They fell into the sweet spot for Habitat -- somewhere between the people who make too little to maintain a house properly and those who make enough to buy one on their own. ""We are able to look at this tragedy as one of the best days of our lives,"" she said. Habitat even built them a storm shelter, so she and the boys have somewhere to escape to when the next tornado comes.

Opinion,Dr. Robert Gallo: The Case for a Stopgap Vaccine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/opinion/letters/coronavirus-vaccine-gallo.html,"""Antibodies Didn't Last Long After Infection in Study, Especially for Asymptomatic"" (news article, June 19) highlights that unknowing or recovered Covid-19 carriers at best develop weak antibodies that may be effective for some few months, leaving carriers vulnerable to the possibility of repeat infection.

This appears to rule out ""herd immunity"" as an avenue for vanquishing the virus. It appears that true immunity will come only from a vaccine that works to prevent infection safely for a defined and specific period of time and can be produced and delivered to billions of people quickly. Once such a vaccine is proved effective, we will learn for how long only with the passage of time.

Virtually all vaccines under investigation target the ""spike"" protein that is used by the pandemic virus, SARS-CoV-2, for cell entry. What's Plan B if the antibodies to the spike protein are not durable or if the spike protein mutates, as has been seen in some studies?

To get over the gap until we have a proven, effective, classic vaccine, which gives specific antibodies and specific cellular immunity, we believe that an immediately available and promising approach involves stimulating the body's own innate immune system to do the job.",The noted virologist says a polio vaccine may be an ideal solution until we find a Covid-specific vaccine.

Health,Scientists Link a Gene Mutation to Rheumatic Heart Disease,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/29/health/rheumatic-heart-disease-strep-genes.html,"Whether a painful strep throat turns into a fatal case of heart disease depends not just on prompt antibiotic treatment but also on the patient's genetic makeup, according to a new study led by Oxford University scientists.

The discovery could help the long fight to find a vaccine against Group A streptococcus bacteria, which cause strep throat, scarlet fever and rheumatic heart disease. (Antibiotic-resistant versions of the same pathogen that get under the skin can rot muscles away and are sometimes called flesh-eating bacteria.)

About 15 million people around the world have rheumatic heart disease, scarring of the heart valves that can lead to early death unless the valve is surgically repaired or replaced.

The disease is mostly a relic of the past in rich and middle-income countries, where pediatricians quickly treat strep throat and rheumatic fever in children, which causes the joint pain once called childhood rheumatism.","Patients with strep infections were far more likely to suffer damaged heart valves if they had a certain mutation, researchers reported.",ad55c919-01b5-55d2-98d2-e8cd43fa4826,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/30/science/30GLOBAL/30GLOBAL-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=a32df0401b4b372822b2a6af74e3140209d9a664779b9fe6c4d1c9a50ab4d5d8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An X-ray of the greatly enlarged heart of a patient with rheumatic heart disease.,ad55c919-01b5-55d2-98d2-e8cd43fa4826,N24News/imgs/ad55c919-01b5-55d2-98d2-e8cd43fa4826.jpg,1

Media,CBS Makes a Bigger Bet on Comedy,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/business/media/cbs-makes-a-bigger-bet-on-comedy.html,"CBS is presenting its 2016-17 fall schedule to advertisers at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday afternoon. Here is a preview.

CBS has tried for the last couple of years to find a worthy successor to ""The Big Bang Theory,"" which remains TV's top-rated comedy. Those efforts have yet to pay off, but CBS is taking a mighty big swing this year.

The network is expanding from one two-hour comedy block in its fall schedule last year (on Wednesday night) to two blocks this year (adding Monday night). CBS's entertainment president, Glenn Geller, told reporters on Wednesday morning that the network's development strategy was about ""big comedy and big, big stars.""

CBS executives are going with three recognizable names:","The network, still trying to find a worthy successor to ""Big Bang Theory,"" is expanding its comedy block programming.",e6b872d1-986f-5342-ae3d-3e53c2377968,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/19/business/19cbs1/19cbs1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=873c38f7590fc598faae72488b2092452cca92100e0b184e19640465973a2d44&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Kevin James in ""Kevin Can Wait.""",e6b872d1-986f-5342-ae3d-3e53c2377968,N24News/imgs/e6b872d1-986f-5342-ae3d-3e53c2377968.jpg,16
Real Estate,Pop Up Goes the Retail Scene as Store Vacancies Rise,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/realestate/commercial/pop-up-stores-retail-vacancies.html,"As traditional retail stores close and vacancies mount, landlords across the country appear newly receptive to leases as short as a week, eschewing the typical 10-year time frame, even in locations that once shunned limited stays. The upswing in pop-up stores, as the short-term placements are called, is playing out in all sorts of ways, and in all sorts of places -- including dark malls, former grocery stores and shuttered art galleries, according to real estate brokers, landlords and tenants. For retailers, the stores can offer lower rents and far less commitment. For the landlords, the reason is just as clear: A short-term tenant is better than no tenant at all. ""Landlords have their backs against the wall right now,"" said Samantha Elias, the co-founder of the Vintage Twin, a secondhand clothing company whose stores frequently pop up in Manhattan. ""I tell them that some money is better than no money, and I promise not to bother you.""

The rise in pop-up stores is adding another element of change to a retail industry facing upheaval from profound shifts in consumer habits and powerful new competitors, especially online. In the past, short-term tenants focused on holidays like Halloween: Costumes were hot items in October, but sales evaporated once the calendar turned to November. But today, the products go far beyond monster masks, to skin serums, designer handbags and crystal champagne flutes, as brands see pop-ups as an opportunity for quick public exposure or as a possible steppingstone to something bigger. And while some landlords continue to shun short-term deals -- arguing that the rents, which are generally below market rate, do not justify the trouble and cost involved with preparing a space -- they are quickly dwindling in number. ""The trend has become more prevalent in the last year or so,"" said Karen Bellantoni, a vice chairwoman of RKF, a retail-focused national brokerage firm. RKF does not specifically track pop-ups, which is also the case with other major firms. But the fleeting boutiques are an increasingly bigger part of agents' business, including in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas and New York. ""We're definitely seeing landlords looking for them,"" Ms. Bellantoni added.

Landlords are finally coming around, she said, but they may have no choice, as stores continue to go out of business. Ms. Elias added that ""it must be really scary right now"" for owners in SoHo, where most of her pop-ups have been. But the new stores can cause landlords to lose money, said Stephen Summers, the managing director of Highland Park Village, an upscale shopping center near Dallas that is in the midst of a multiyear renovation. In late 2014, Mr. Summers installed Goop, an online retailer founded by Gwyneth Paltrow, for a four-week run in a former grocery store at his historic red-tile-roof complex, a widely copied model for the 20th-century shopping center. Because the store, at 20,000 square feet, was considered too large for Goop's needs, Mr. Summers had to construct a more intimate 1,500-square-foot berth, including dressing rooms. That renovation ultimately caused the deal to be unprofitable, he said, even though Goop drew so many customers that there were lines around the block. But Mr. Summers said he was glad to have a relationship with the company. Goop, which has popped up in multiple spots, is planning to open permanent locations, and Mr. Summers plans to court the company. ""Pop-ups are a responsible way to grow,"" he said.

Like Goop, other web-born businesses are seeking a bricks-and-mortar presence as well, aware that most shopping is still done offline, and are turning to pop-ups to get their start. For instance, Daniel Wellington, a six-year-old watch company with a heavy social media presence, has been selling its timepieces in part through department stores like Bloomingdale's and small jewelry shops. But in November 2015, it opened its first temporary store in the East Village of Manhattan. A year later, it opened one in nearby SoHo for two months. Because that location was a success, Wellington signed a more permanent six-year lease for the same space, said Ola Melin, a company spokesman. Wellington also has pop-ups in Boston, Miami and Honolulu, among other cities, Mr. Melin said.

In SoHo, where pop-ups are especially popular, the range in rents can be significant. Long-term tenants have been paying in some cases up to $150,000 a month, brokers and tenants say. But pop-ups can get deals for $25,000 a month. They generally pay all their rent upfront and agree to leave with a few days' notice if a longer-term tenant is signed. While some buildings may be hard to get into, others seem more inviting, like 543 Broadway. That is where Vintage Twin -- which is owned by Ms. Elias and her twin sister, Morgan -- has been set up since April, and which bustled with shoppers on a recent weekday afternoon. A tie-dyed Grateful Dead concert T-shirt from the 1990s was $244. Several pop-ups have set up camp at the address, a Beaux-Arts edifice, since Carlo Pazolini, a shoes and accessories store, closed in 2015 after a four-year stay. ""To keep the neighborhood alive and vibrant, you need to have retailers occupying space, especially in today's day and age,"" said Jared Epstein, a principal of Aurora Capital Associates, the building's landlord.

Similarly, last year, Aurora installed the Broadway Market Company, a pop-up with various vendors who sell handbags, jewelry and stationery, in a vacant building it owns nearby. Its lease is expected to run about 18 months. Likewise, an Aurora-owned building in SoHo in May welcomed Artists and Fleas, another market with tables and racks from different vendors, which replaced a 10,000-square-foot Armani Exchange store that closed in March. Artists and Fleas has committed to a one-year lease, Mr. Epstein said. Swooping in to capitalize on the rash of empty stores in New York and elsewhere are some new brokerage-type businesses, which charge fees to landlords as brokers do and also sometimes market spaces concurrently with other agents. Examples include Space in the Raw, a two-year-old firm that for about a month last fall joined Taco Bell with Sony PlayStation for a SoHo pop-up, in its first New York retail deal. There is also Appear Here, a four-year-old British company that opened a New York office in April. Since then, it has found homes for dozens of pop-ups, said Ross Bailey, its chief executive, including Misbhv, an apparel company, on East 34th Street, in a part of Midtown where empty stores are evident. Mr. Bailey says that contrary to popular belief, young adults want to touch what they buy and also enjoy the physical shopping experience. Besides, ""it would be a sad world if everybody was staying at home looking at screens,"" he said. This month, Appear Here raised nearly $13 million in venture capital, bringing its total in raised funds to about $21 million.

But in a way, pop-ups, despite their growing ubiquity, are like Band-Aids on deep wounds when it comes to the problem of stubborn vacancy rates, brokers say. ""Rents are just too high, and it's just too cost-prohibitive to be here,"" said David Barreto, the founder of Cast Iron Real Estate in SoHo and someone who encourages landlords to do what it takes to fill spaces. ""It's really just sad.""","For retailers, the stores can offer lower rents and less commitment. And for landlords, a short-term tenant is better than no tenant at all.",31a39727-6c86-5c41-8879-25fd29342f47,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/31/business/31POPUPSQFT/31POPUPSQFT-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=7649b820d679b2fcd8cfedffcb71ae28c2b8b82af5d2fd5d559570c39a68eb67&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The twin sisters Samantha, left, and Morgan Elias founded the Vintage Twin, a secondhand clothing company whose stores frequently pop up in Manhattan.",31a39727-6c86-5c41-8879-25fd29342f47,N24News/imgs/31a39727-6c86-5c41-8879-25fd29342f47.jpg,7
Art & Design,"Nancy Spector Returns to Guggenheim, as Chief Curator and Artistic Director",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/arts/design/nancy-spector-returns-to-guggenheim-museum.html,", the longtime chief curator of the Guggenheim Museum who made an unusual career move last spring to lead the curatorial team at the Brooklyn Museum, has decided to reverse course and go back to the Guggenheim as both chief curator and artistic director, a new and more powerful position created for her.

Richard Armstrong, the Guggenheim's director, said that after the departure of Ms. Spector, a highly respected voice in contemporary art, the museum had put together a strong group of international candidates to replace her, ""but for various reasons none of that really bore fruit, and as I came to a point of aggravation, I guess, Nancy and I saw each other and started a conversation.""

He said that as artistic director, Ms. Spector would have a greater say in programming and acquisitions not only at the Guggenheim in New York, but also at the museum's satellites in Bilbao, Spain, and Venice, and an outpost being planned in Abu Dhabi. (Late last year, longstanding plans to build another satellite in Helsinki were voted down by Finnish lawmakers; besides giving the Guggenheim a presence there, the agreement to create the new museum would have added money to the Guggenheim's endowment.)

""Because we're multi-sited and that's growing, it seemed to me like the institution really needed a discriminating synthesizer, and Nancy was interested in that and I think really the best person for it,"" Mr. Armstrong said.","Ms. Spector would have a greater say at the Guggenheim in New York, and at the museum's satellites in Bilbao and Venice.",c061fc7c-9f62-567c-b7ac-8274c6824a48,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/16/arts/16SPECTOR-ITEM/16SPECTOR-ITEM-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=523&w=1000&s=23a2605ec936e6e38e4e4ec4fd996a1043aa066b9afea1a1f4858196b5e7a39a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Nancy Spector,c061fc7c-9f62-567c-b7ac-8274c6824a48,N24News/imgs/c061fc7c-9f62-567c-b7ac-8274c6824a48.jpg,14
Real Estate,Upper East Side Block of Genuine Interest,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/realestate/upper-east-side-block-of-genuine-interest.html,"So maybe you think you're pretty good at ""Where's Waldo."" But can you spot the impostors on East 80th Street between Park and Lexington? Mostly it's a block of demure 1920s high-style mansions and private houses unchanged since 1930. At least, that's what it seems. A streetwise eye may catch two venerable-seeming facades built after the most recent turn of a century -- but how about the third? The south side of 80th Street was built up all at once in 1871 with brownstones; the last of those, 138 East 80th, survived until about eight years ago. After 1900, the railroad running under Park Avenue was converted from steam to electricity, and a new class of people ventured east from the more refined addresses between Fifth and Park. They had the means to build comfortable brick townhouses like 123 East 80th, designed in 1914 by Augustus Allen, working for the banker Walter Hope, later assistant secretary of the Treasury. The house at 134 East 80th was designed in 1924 by Wallace McCrea for Bruce Barton, the second B in BBDO, the advertising firm of Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn. He also wrote inspirational tracts such as ""Just What Would Bolshevism Do to Me?"" (a ""nightmare"") and ""Is College Worth It?"" (to which Barton, an Amherst graduate, answered yes.)

No. 136 belonged to Robert Turnbull, a lawyer who in 1924 retained Louis S. Weeks for a ""block beautiful""-type remodeling of his brownstone in the current mode, a simple new facade of colored stucco with a few picturesque details. The peak period of the block was the late 1920s, when four magnificent double-width houses on the south side of the street were completed, including Mott Schmidt's cool, classical design for Vincent Astor at No. 130. After the townhouse phase swept the block, little happened to the streetscape. In 1949 the architect Joshua Tabachnik put a very nice two-story front of fake stone on the house at No. 129. Do not scoff! In Manhattan, those midcentury brick veneers are becoming scarce, and this is truly a superb example (though blocked by a construction shed at the moment). Surely someone in Brooklyn has restored one, although that would be an advanced idea for Manhattan. This block is not covered by landmark designation, and thus its buildings are wild things ungoverned by anything except the owners' good or bad judgment. Such places always repay study, for they reveal the true state of public taste.

But then there is Ben Z. Cohen, a retina surgeon, who since the 1990s has practiced at No. 140, a perfectly nice Georgian-style 1923 doctors' building. Around 2006, he demolished the surviving brownstone next door at No. 138, and built a new building. ""Yes, I'm the guilty party,"" he said the other day, adding that he hated to do it. However, Dr. Cohen's extension of No. 138 is a near-perfect match to the 1920s facade at 140, quite a surprise since he could have done something quick and dirty. He skimped only on the trim, cast stone instead of limestone. ""I wanted to make it look like it was there before I was born, I didn't want to damage the block, like that big thing,"" He said, referring to No. 117-119 across the street. For such a humble project, No. 138 is very good, even award worthy, although nobody came by with a blue ribbon when it went up. It's a measure of the extent to which history now informs most architectural projects, even non-showcase ones. The second impostor, although it will pass only if you are looking from across the street, is next door at No. 136, the old Turnbull house. Sometime around 2000 it received a new Georgian-style front that, from a distance, seems to blend in with the other 1920s townhouses. But up close you can see that the first floor is not marble, but scored white stucco, and that the red brick is actually a thin applique. Some of the old window trim has been reused, although just hacked off at the bottom. From a few feet away, it is very thin gruel. The newest-oldest thing is the 2013 townhouse designed by the architect Peter Pennoyer at No. 125, all limestone with superb workmanship and detailing. Mr. Pennoyer noticed oval columns, a very subtle detail, on the Hope house next door at No. 123, and used those elements in his design.

Mr. Pennoyer says he thought about making the house brick, but decided that would make it too similar to its neighbors. So he went with limestone, and then used a half-circle recess above the main floor windows to respond to the same detail on the double-wide Astor house across the street at No. 130. Mr. Pennoyer's is the latest and among the most successful essays in designing a Neo-traditional townhouse in Manhattan, and it would fool many. But that is not to say he means to deceive anyone: it's his belief that traditional styles are just as contemporary as the desert dwelling up the street, maybe even more so. Dr. Cohen is an admirer. Except, he says, ""you know, it's even too good -- it really should be on Fifth Avenue.""","Change has come to a stretch of townhouses, although you may not notice if you bustle by.",275fa093-0f9c-59ca-966c-65826cd8ded3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/06/realestate/06SCAPES1_SPAN/06scapes-1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=974294893574ed716cb5f2c82ee7c83b460fdd848ac68720477c17e4a2bec58b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"What's recent and what's not on East 80th between Park and Lexington?

I got it from the Ferragamo store in New York City almost a year ago. I like the way it fits, which is slim, and it's a little fun with the collar. You can also take off the collar, and then you get a different look. It works well with jeans and also with suits.

2 Suit We have to wear suits when we travel and go to games, so four to five days a week, you're in a suit. I remember my first couple of years in the league, there were a lot of comments about how I dressed, because I guess it was more European. I was wearing skinny ties -- this was 11 years ago -- and they were not used to that. But then two years later, skinny ties started to pick up in the U.S., especially in New York. But I've found it doesn't really matter what people say. If you feel comfortable, stick with it. The last couple of years, I've been starting to wear more and more double-breasted styles. It's kind of a little bit more old-school. I like one by this Swedish brand Stephen F.

3 Shoes Ferragamo makes the best shoes. My favorite is probably a pair of black velvet ones, although I don't wear them all the time. 4 Watch I picked up a new TAG Heuer watch a few months ago. It's in rose gold, and I've been wearing that the most lately. When it comes to clothes, I wear a lot of blue, black and gray, and also, of course, white shirts. The watch has a gray face and gray band, but then it looks really good with the rose gold. The contrast is what made it stand out. But it's still a very clean look, which is what I like. 5 Jeans If I'm not in suits, I'll wear jeans, boots and a leather jacket. I love music and I like a little bit of that rock 'n' roll look. I wear a lot of black jeans. My favorites are by Tiger of Sweden. They're skinny but not too tight. Again, that was something I got a lot of comments on in the early days, but it's pretty common here now. And now the younger guys in the league dress better and care more about clothes. But even if someone teases you, just laugh it off.

Dance,6 Dance Performances to See in N.Y.C. This Weekend,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/arts/dance/nyc-this-weekend-dance.html,"[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]

LANZHOU SONG AND DANCE THEATER at the David H. Koch Theater (Jan. 9-11, 8 p.m.; through Jan. 12). The Chinese city of Dunhuang was once a stop on the famous Silk Road. One of its main attractions is the Mogao Caves, which contain ancient Buddhist art. ""Tales of the Silk Road,"" an elaborate production choreographed in 2000 by Chen Weiya and Zhang Jigang, tells its mythical origin story: The artist Mogao falls in love with Yueya but is forbidden to marry her. They flee, only to get caught in a battle that ends tragically. This troupe, formed in 1973, colorfully illustrates the tale through both traditional and contemporary dance and music.

GABRIELLE REVLOCK at the Flea (Jan. 8-11, 7 p.m.; through Jan. 12). The inspiration for Revlock's duet ""Sex Tape"" are conversations and interactions she has had with men. But in translating those experiences to performance, she has replaced the men with a woman so that an erotically charged relationship suddenly becomes a tender, intimate study in friendship. For this program, that work is joined by ""Nuptial Blitz,"" which dissects the ritual of wedding photographs. Revlock invites several audience members to pose beside her as her betrothed, gently satirizing this ritual while also presenting a spectrum of romantic configurations.

AKI SASAMOTO at Danspace Project (Jan. 9-11 and 16-18, 8 p.m.). St. Mark's Church, the home of Danspace, has always been a special place -- part theater, part chapel. Sasamoto, a visual and performing artist with a dance background, takes inspiration from the space in ""Phase Transition,"" an installation and performance. The title of the work comes from the term used to describe when a substance changes from one form to another (e.g., from solid to liquid). Sasamoto will create a custom air circulation system for the church that during her lecture-performances she and others will manipulate, creating a shifting interior climate that speaks to the constantly moving essence of our lives.

Your Money,"Prepaid Debit Cards Shed Some Fees, but Face Scrutiny",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/your-money/prepaid-debit-cards-shed-some-fees-but-face-scrutiny.html,"Prepaid debit cards continue to grow more popular and offer more services that mimic traditional debit cards, even as the federal government weighs new rules for the cards.

In the latest expansion of a prepaid card offering, American Express on Tuesday announced that starting in November, customers will be able to load cash onto its Serve prepaid card, without charge, at about 14,000 CVS and 7-Eleven stores. The move is part of a revamping of the card to make it more attractive to customers who don't use traditional banks, said Dan Schulman, head of the enterprise growth division at American Express.

That means if you're a customer, you'll be able to have the funds automatically loaded onto your Serve card by swiping it at the register, without having to buy a separate cash-value card first. (The arrangement is like the one for Bluebird, an American Express card that can be loaded directly with cash at roughly 4,000 Walmart stores.) And customers can withdraw cash free at A.T.M.'s on the Money Pass network, found in convenience stores and other retailers.

The direct-load option eliminates a step in reloading the cards that consumers find inconvenient, Mr. Schulman said; after buying the cash-value card, customers must either call or go online to have the funds transferred to their prepaid account. The cards typically cost $3 to $5 and, since most customers reload prepaid cards two or more times a month, the fees add up.","The cards are growing more popular even as the federal government is weighing new rules, including better disclosure of fees.",a3e80cad-5bff-510b-81eb-09fed15b2b45,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/09/your-money/09adviser-sub/09adviser-sub-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=376&w=600&s=2a698c26a34fd3eea7508e5cd982c62693dc1e2c1d4c2c92f8be21db503f455f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,The new Serve card is one of several prepaid cards from American Express.,a3e80cad-5bff-510b-81eb-09fed15b2b45,N24News/imgs/a3e80cad-5bff-510b-81eb-09fed15b2b45.jpg,21
Media,Jim Nelson to Leave GQ After a 15-Year Run as Its Top Editor,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/business/media/jim-nelson-gq-editor.html,"Earlier this year, GQ won two National Magazine Awards and a Pulitzer Prize. On Thursday, Conde Nast announced that it was replacing its editor in chief.

Jim Nelson, who edited the men's monthly for 15 years, will turn over the publication at the end of the year to Will Welch, GQ's creative director and the editor of its quarterly fashion-focused spinoff, GQ Style.

""I've been at GQ for 21 years and in this job for more than 15 -- a good, long, productive run, not to mention a ton of fun -- and I've gotten to work with some of the most talented writers, editors, photographers, designers and creative minds in the business,"" Mr. Nelson said in a statement. ""So I leave feeling proud and confident in the excellence of the work we've done together, but more than that, grateful.""

Before joining GQ, Mr. Nelson worked as a field producer for CNN, an assistant for television writers in Los Angeles and an editor at Harper's Magazine.

Style,Is That Rock for Real?,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/18/style/international/purveyors-of-grown-diamonds-seek-acceptance.html,"NEW YORK -- Lisa Bissell studied the six pink diamonds lined up like candies on a white tray in her Midtown Manhattan office. ""All of these were born in the last couple months,"" she said. She pointed to a round fancy pink diamond weighing 1.2 carats. ""This one may be six months older, but they're all babies,"" she said. ""That's how I look at them."" As president and chief executive of Pure Grown Diamonds, a distributor and jewelry manufacturer specializing in artificial diamonds, Ms. Bissell has a clear interest in nurturing the lab-grown diamond business. Pure Grown sells synthetic diamonds that are white, pink, yellow and champagne-colored and come from a few global producers, including IIa Technologies, which is based in Singapore. These stones are optically, chemically and physically identical to natural, mined diamonds, but they suffer from a longstanding image problem. ""A lot of people don't understand a synthetic, what it is and how it differs from a mined diamond,"" said Rob Bates, news director at JCK, a jewelry industry trade publication of which this writer is editor in chief. ""They think it's a cubic zirconia or it's fake.""

According to guidelines from the Federal Trade Commission, an independent United States government agency, the terms ""synthetic,"" ""lab-grown,"" ""man-made"" and ""(company)-created"" are legitimate and interchangeable modifiers for diamonds created in a lab. Marketers, however, prefer to avoid the word ""synthetic"" because they fear that it has a negative connotation among consumers. Beyond their origin in a lab as opposed to deep below the earth's crust, the pinks on Ms. Bissell's tray -- which began as lab-grown colorless diamonds before undergoing a secondary coloration treatment -- depart from their mined counterparts in one significant way: cost. The artificial gems retail from $9,189 -- for the smallest and faintest of them, a 1.2-carat fancy pink -- to $21,898 for the most saturated, a 1.3-carat gem Ms. Bissell described as ""fancy deep pink."" Natural pink diamonds with saturated hues typically cost more than $100,000 per carat, sometimes much more. At a Christie's New York jewelry sale on June 10, for example, a 5.5-carat oval-shaped fancy vivid pink diamond earned $9.6 million, or $1.7 million a carat. Not all lab-grown diamonds offer such dramatic bargains. Most artificial colorless diamonds trade at 20 percent to 30 percent discounts compared with mined diamonds of a similar size, color and quality. Still, even at those reduced premiums, the synthetic diamond business has seen a swell of interest from designers, manufacturers and jewelers over the past year.

""The most critical part of the growth business is being honest and telling everybody, not once but a hundred times: 'These are grown diamonds; they're just like diamonds, except they're grown above the ground instead of below the ground,""' Ms. Bissell said. ""The only negativity we encounter is within our own industry because they're so fearful of things that aren't even really possible."" Fearful is an understatement. Scientists have been able to synthesize diamonds for the better part of 60 years, but the category has barely developed because the jewelry trade tends to ostracize purveyors of lab-grown diamonds. ""One reason jewelers don't want to go into the synthetic diamond business is because they feel they're cannibalizing mined diamonds,"" Mr. Bates said. ""It's a hard balance."" The conversation about lab-grown diamonds reached a fever pitch in June when members of the industry gathered for an annual jewelry trade fair at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas. On the show floor, Reena Ahluwalia, a Canadian designer, introduced Nurture by Reena, a sleek designer line featuring colorless, pink and yellow lab-grown diamonds. At a nearby booth, Kama Schachter, an Indian diamond and jewelry manufacturer, promoted a new lower-priced line of bridal rings called Kama's Rox, using emerald-cut lab-grown diamonds as center stones. Even as their presence signaled the product's growing acceptance within the industry, worried members of the trade gathered in meeting rooms downstairs to discuss the threat that synthetics posed to the traditional diamond marketplace. Earlier that week, a lab in Israel announced that it had detected undisclosed artificial stones mixed with a parcel of natural mined diamonds. The news incited a panic.

""What will happen when the quality of man-made diamonds gets to be so good that labs will have trouble telling the difference?"" asked Ben Janowski, founder of Janos Consultants in New York. It is a valid question, and one the trade has been asking since 1954, when scientists at General Electric produced a synthetic diamond in a high-pressure, high-temperature growth chamber, simulating what happens inside the earth. Known as H.P.H.T., the method was denounced by the jewelry trade as the beginning of the end for natural diamonds. ""They were scared to death,"" said Tom Chatham, chief executive of Chatham Created Gems & Diamonds in San Marcos, Calif., and a longtime advocate of lab-grown diamonds. ""It took a while for everybody to realize it was a laboratory curiosity at that point -- and not going to affect the jewelry industry."" There are many reasons why it took so long for H.P.H.T.-grown diamonds to become more commonplace in the industry. For one thing, ""nobody shares any information,"" Mr. Chatham said. For another, the method is expensive and subject to the same vagaries that plague natural diamonds. James Shigley, a research fellow at the Gemological Institute of America in Carlsbad, Calif., said, ""The challenge for the grower is to create the conditions and maintain them at a steady level."" ""If you have some fluctuation in the temperature or pressure,"" he added, ""that's reflected as some kind of defect in the diamond.""

""You put a gas, like methane, into the end of the growth chamber and you have a source of energy like a microwave beam,"" Mr. Shigley said. ""And that makes the carbon atoms kind of rain down on a substrate."" At first, the C.V.D. process yielded diamond wafers too thin to produce gem-quality diamonds. The method has since been refined, however, and now dozens of companies -- many in China, India and the former Soviet republics -- have jumped into the arena using variations on C.V.D. Most growers are drawn to the potential of synthetic diamonds for industrial applications in the semiconductor, nanotechnology and tooling equipment sectors; but some are eyeing the luxury market, if grudgingly. The industrial diamond sector has become crowded with competing firms, ""which makes people look over their shoulder to figure out what else they can produce to make their factories profitable,"" Mr. Chatham said. Among the leaders are powerful producers such as Element Six, the London-based synthetic division of the diamond miner De Beers, and Sumitomo Electric, a Japanese company that has been synthesizing diamonds since 1982.

""It's a five-billion-carat-a-year business industrially today, so there are a lot of players up on making diamonds -- except they don't have any real interest in the gem trade,"" Mr. Chatham said. ""Industrial-use diamonds are not very big, and they're yellow. But it's a very short leap, technologically, to get from yellow to white -- and to carat size."" Recent developments have made jewelers more inclined to consider lab-grown diamonds. For one, supporters are promoting them as environmentally friendly alternatives to mined diamonds. In the ethical controversy over ""conflict diamonds"" mined in war zones in the late 1990s and early 2000s, some retailers are also emphasizing synthetics' certifiable, conflict-free origin. On its Facebook page, for example, Golcondia, a two-month-old retail store in Manila that sells lab-grown diamonds, describes its products as ""the environmentally friendly, conflict-free, ethical and socially responsible choice in diamonds."" Proponents also point out that lab-grown diamonds boast a ""Type II"" designation, referring to gems that are devoid of nitrogen, an element that lends stones a slightly yellowish tinge. Only about 2 percent of the diamonds found in nature are Type II, and their crystals are prized for their transparent, limpid and watery qualities. Besides purity, the Type II chemical signature provides gemologists with the keys to detection. ""If you can identify a diamond as a Type Ia diamond, which is what nature produces, then you know it's natural and can't be produced in a lab,"" Mr. Shigley said. The industry's watchdogs play down the threat posed by undisclosed synthetics entering the mined diamond pipeline, but they concede that there is cause for concern when it comes to stones weighing less than 20 points, or one-fifth of a carat, known as ""melee"" diamonds.

""The real challenge we're facing is not the 2-carat stones -- those are easy to recognize,"" Mr. Shigley said. ""It's these small, melee-sized diamonds. That's the biggest problem -- because most jewelry manufacturers are living in the melee world and not the big stone world."" The Automated Melee Screening device from the International Institute of Diamond Grading & Research, a London-based division of De Beers, is designed to help manufacturers defend their supply chains from that very scenario. Introduced to De Beers's clients earlier this year, the machine, which costs $55,000, plus a $10,000 annual warranty and servicing fee, is now available to the wider industry. Jonathan Kendall, president of the institute, said that the machines were designed ""to bring back confidence"" and that much of the hysteria over synthetic diamonds was misplaced. ""The interest in synthetics tends to go in waves,"" he said. ""The last major wave was in 2004-2005. Everyone was talking about it, panicking. The industry got into a heated debate about the scale of the problem, and nothing happened."" ""The reality is there aren't that many producers at all,"" Mr. Kendall continued. ""If there's no market, you can't push this stuff on to an unwilling consumer."" But will that still be true in 10 to 15 years, when a steady increase in diamond demand from consumers in India and the Far East may translate to diminishing supplies of mined diamonds?

""There will always be purists competing for mined diamonds and then there will be people like a young lady who gets engaged and says, 'Look at this diamond,""' he said: ""Whether or not she chooses to tell someone it's mined or created, that's her choice. But that's a real diamond."" Mr. Koppel, a longtime evangelist for the lab-grown business, offered this analogy. ""It's like you have a baby. ""Whether it was conceived naturally or conceived through I.V.F., you don't say, 'This is my test tube baby.' You say, 'It's my baby.' This is no different.""","They look identical to their peers found in nature, but grown diamonds still struggle with an image problem.",0f341754-1c60-57d5-93cd-704f6c0c65e9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/14/style/international/18iht-acaj-diamonds18-diamonds/18iht-acaj-diamonds18-diamonds-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=368&w=600&s=d09609becfce9871cc5e2e91c867a1b89547d5d4e4961dc967d9f5bca0d61b7f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Brilliant round vivid fancy bubble-gum pink created diamonds from Renaissance Diamonds.,0f341754-1c60-57d5-93cd-704f6c0c65e9,N24News/imgs/0f341754-1c60-57d5-93cd-704f6c0c65e9.jpg,15

TERENCE STAMP at the Metrograph (March 23-April 1). Many actors grow up onscreen, but Mr. Stamp actually had an early role recycled. In ""The Limey"" (on March 31 and April 1), from 1999, he plays Wilson, a laconic criminal who travels from London to Los Angeles to avenge his daughter's death. The director, Steven Soderbergh, repurposed scenes from Ken Loach's ""Poor Cow"" (1968) to suggest Wilson's younger days. But ""Poor Cow"" (on Saturday), featuring Mr. Stamp as a good-hearted thief who briefly offers the prospect of happiness for the wife (Carol White) of an imprisoned colleague, is worth seeing on its own; it may come as a surprise to viewers who know only Mr. Loach's more didactic recent portraits of Britain's working class. Those craving a more cryptic version of Mr. Stamp can catch him in Pier Paolo Pasolini's influential ""Teorema"" (on March 31 and April 1) as an interloper who upends a wealthy household in Milan.

Real Estate,Can I Fit a Bed and a Dresser in Here?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/realestate/can-i-fit-a-bed-and-a-dresser-in-here.html,"Blake Bejan knew that moving from San Francisco to Manhattan would be an adjustment, but he never imagined that owning a queen-size bed would be a problem. Or that having the space for a dresser and some shelves could be considered a luxury. That's what he discovered last October, when he was considering a studio in Chelsea. Time was running out, as he had to move out of the temporary housing his employer, Uber Eats, had arranged for him. ""I really, really liked the spot. I really wanted it to work,"" said Mr. Bejan, 25. ""So I eyeballed it. I said, 'I think I can make this work.' I jumped into the decision because I was feeling rushed."" But then Mr. Bejan compared the apartment's measurements to those of the bed, dresser and shelves he was having shipped from California, where he had shared a two-bedroom apartment, and realized they wouldn't fit.

""My bed alone would have come right up to the edge of the kitchen island,"" Mr. Bejan said. ""I would have been climbing over my furniture just to move around."" He didn't want to buy all new furniture: It wasn't as if his furniture was preposterously proportioned; it wasn't even particularly large. ""For me, an apartment is not just a place to store my body at night,"" Mr. Bejan said. ""I didn't want my bed to be the primary surface in the apartment.""

He got out of the deal, but then had only one day to find a new place before leaving for a vacation in Amsterdam. As he worked in West Chelsea, he had been looking on the West Side, but most of the apartments he had seen were small walk-ups with challenging layouts. Consulting a transit map -- which he had used to guide his search, an easy commute being his only other priority -- he decided to change tack and head east.

Occupation: Marketing manager, Uber Eats

Apartment hunting in New York vs. California: ""I had to consider air-conditioning for the first time in my life,"" said Mr. Bejan, who is from San Jose and has lived in San Francisco since college.

On using a broker: The broker's fee gave him pause, but using a broker turned out to be a big help. ""I was so overwhelmed seeing apartments,"" he said, ""and they kept certain things in mind.""

Good and bad surprises: A dishwasher, which he wasn't expecting, and noise from the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. ""At 6 a.m., it's loud as hell,"" he said. ""I made a sound dampener out of a board and foam, and bear-cage myself in most mornings.""

The best things about New York: ""I really like the people. I think they're really genuine here; people in San Francisco can be fake."" Plus, the music scene in Brooklyn and the food. ""I love Levain Bakery. I recently took visiting friends through Central Park and strategically navigated us through the park to end up there."" As he and his real estate agent, Marien Richardson of Citi Habitats, toured listings around Murray Hill and Kip's Bay, they kept bumping into another apartment seeker and his broker. ""Sometimes we'd be there first, sometimes they'd be before us. I was like, 'O.K., you're my competition.'"" Mr. Bejan said. ""It was really intense."" At a building in the East 30s, the unit they had come to see wasn't available for viewing -- the tenant was in the midst of moving out -- but the one below was empty. For $2,325 a month, the apartment was not too small but not too large. There was a small entrance hall and space for not only all the furniture he owned, including the bed, but also for a small sofa. Plus, there was laundry in the building and an unexpected bonus, a dishwasher. And if the view was nothing much -- the one window faced a brick wall -- at least the wall was on the other side of a street, so there was natural light.

He was told that the apartment above had a newer floor and stainless steel appliances, but it also cost about $75 more a month. ""I don't need that stuff that bad. This floor is fine; it's not like it's ruining my life,"" he said of his older parquet. He put in an application and hoped for the best. The response came fast: Because he didn't meet the landlord's income requirements and neither of his parents lived in the tristate area, so they couldn't act as guarantors, the landlord wanted four months' rent as security deposit. ""I was like, 'I don't have that much money!'"" Mr. Bejan said. The first month's rent was being offered free, but he still had to come up with last month's rent and the broker's fee. He offered two months' rent as a security deposit and the landlord countered with three. The discussion stopped there. ""I really wanted it, "" Mr. Bejan said. ""But I didn't have the three months, so I was like, 'Oh well.'"" He was on his way to the airport the next afternoon when he got a call.

Education,How School Districts Are Outsmarting a Microbe,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/education/learning/coronavirus-online-class-public-schools.html,"Credit...Elizabeth Frantz for The New York Times



This article is part of our latest Learning special report, which focuses on the challenges of online education during the coronavirus outbreak. In some cities, school buses now deliver daily paper packets of schoolwork, along with bagged breakfasts and lunches. In others, schools use PBS's ""Nova"" program to help teach science. Elsewhere, teachers hold daily virtual office hours to check on the academic and emotional well-being of students they can no longer meet face to face. Confronting the unprecedented challenge of lengthy school closures because of coronavirus, the nation's roughly 13,000 public school districts are scrambling to cope. Almost no district was truly ready to plunge into remote learning full time and with no end in sight. There is no one-size-fits-all remedy and no must-have suite of digital learning tools. Leaders have largely had to find their own way, spurring a hodgepodge of local innovations. As the struggle continues, a few overarching lessons learned -- about equity, expectations and communication -- are now helping schools navigate this crisis on the fly. ""Nobody knows the right path forward,"" said Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education, a nonpartisan education research center in Seattle that has compiled an online database of coronavirus response plans provided by scores of districts as a resource for other educators. ""We're all going to have to try things and give each other grace.""

After dealing with the first priority -- making sure students were safe and fed -- schools had to figure out how to keep the learning alive. But America's persistent digital divide has greatly hampered efforts toward this goal. While most school buildings are fairly well stocked with computers and high-speed internet, millions of students' homes are not, particularly in lower-income and rural areas. This disparity in home computer and internet access, known as the ""homework gap,"" was a slow-burning problem for most districts in the days when schools were in session and students could get online at libraries, after-school programs, coffee shops and other community gathering spots. With everything shut down, the chronic issue of home internet access became an immense challenge. Indeed, because there was unequal access to learning, many districts initially shied away from offering anything educational online, sending only links to optional, self-directed activities, such as math games. Now, in an effort to narrow the digital access gap, school leaders and community partners have devised a bevy of creative, albeit short-term, solutions. In addition to the schoolwork packet deliveries and the PBS broadcasts, many districts have organized the distribution of Wi-Fi hot spots, computers and smartphones, including refurbished devices donated by local businesses (more than 80 percent of the districts in the reinvention center's database say they are providing technology assistance to families).

Miami-Dade County Public Schools, for instance, sent home about 110,000 tablets and other mobile devices, and more than 8,000 smartphones that double as Wi-Fi hot spots. Many broadband providers are also adding capacity, lifting caps on data and offering extended free trial periods. In South Carolina, many of the same buses that take breakfasts and lunches to families stick around to beam out Wi-Fi from routers on board. By contrast, some districts had been bolstering their use of online learning for several years, including Lindsay Unified in California's Central Valley, known as a pioneer in digital-learning circles. In Lindsay, a low-income, rural district, all students have access to home internet thanks to a community Wi-Fi network, and they can get lessons and track their progress via an online portal. Having that digital backbone made the switch to distance learning nearly seamless -- academically, at least. ""We're still concerned about the health and welfare of our learners, now that we don't get to greet them every day,"" said Barry Sommer, Lindsay Unified's director of advancement. ""We can't see what they look like, if they're getting enough sleep and enough to eat."" The center's database is filled with examples of how districts are trying to keep learning going from a distance. Many teachers use ""synchronous"" classes, where they and students meet simultaneously on platforms like Google Hangouts or Microsoft Teams. Some also record those lessons for students who can't meet at the appointed hour. The Richmond Public Schools in Virginia offer on-demand online tutoring sessions. To boost parent participation, many districts offer webinars and other online instruction to help adults gain fluency in the schools' digital tools and guide them through available resources. Some, such as the city schools in Philadelphia and Miami-Dade, have set up phone hotlines in addition to email and web-based communication, in several languages, so families can reach out for help with distance learning or other needs.

But experts emphasize that schools should not expect to replicate what they could achieve in the classroom, and should pursue an approach suited for their own students and teachers and their distance-learning capabilities. What works for a high school in a major urban area may not fit the needs of a rural elementary school. When it comes to technology, the best options for teachers during this crisis are usually the simplest. Online education and remote education are two very different things, said Steve Kossakoski, C.E.O. of the New Hampshire-based Virtual Learning Academy Charter School, which has been hosting free webinars for educators seeking digital-learning guidance.

""Even in a district that's able to send every kid home with a laptop,"" he said, ""you're still trying to adapt a model that's been designed for a classroom situation."" Content aside, teachers in school can walk among their students and provide immediate feedback, spot frustration or flagging attention, and assign students to work for a time in small groups -- all of which is extremely difficult to manage online. Mr. Kossakoski's advice: ""Keep it simple and be consistent."" Some of his webinar attendees have noticed that teachers in their schools are using different tools to reach the same students. ""One teacher uses Zoom, another uses Google Hangouts and a third uses something else,"" he said. ""It's not anybody's fault, but for the student it's very confusing."" Nevertheless, teachers should use whatever level of technology they're comfortable with, said Michael Barbour, associate professor of instructional design at the College of Education and Health Services at California's Touro University: ""Let's not get too clever. When it comes to distance learning, you don't have to be high-tech to be effective."" He suggested, for example, that teachers could email students a video link to a news report about a controversial issue, or a historical documentary, along with a few key questions and a post-viewing writing prompt. ""For a lot of parents, students and teachers, remote learning will be completely new, and where it's new, it's important to set realistic goals every day,"" said Susan Patrick, C.E.O. of the Aurora Institute. The institute, an advocacy organization, promotes competency-based education, in which courses are broken into discrete skills and knowledge that students master at their own pace. These goals could include creating a schedule that sets aside time for reading a book or pursuing other projects that pry students away from their computers, including arts and crafts projects or learning a new skill, such as cooking. In the first weeks of shutdowns, many districts followed state guidelines and offered only optional learning resources -- things like practice sheets, educational videos and recommended reading -- without teacher-led instruction or feedback or the expectation that the work would ""count"" in any way. They hesitated partly out of digital-equity concerns and partly for fear of transgressing federal laws on things like tracking of student progress and accommodations for students with disabilities (such as accepting student work in a variety of formats and providing tutors and speech therapy sessions). The government has since relaxed many of those regulations, offering waivers for educators scrambling to serve their communities. At the same time, many districts raised the bar for teaching and learning as it became clear that closures would stretch deep into the spring, and potentially for the rest of the academic year, as they now have in the majority of states.

""When we first went out, and we were distributing all these Chromebooks on the fly, we thought about just having it be optional, extended learning,"" said Pamela Swanson, superintendent of Westminster Public Schools outside Denver. But then ""we agreed that kids need to be in class, so to speak."" The district already had an internal learning-management system that housed lesson plans, organized assignments and tracked student progress online, she said. Now, with students logging into it from home, ""this is school until further notice."" Rhode Island began planning for distance learning in late February -- a week or two before most places -- after the state's first known coronavirus case was traced to a school trip to Italy. The state's department of education immediately asked school districts to start planning for possible closures, and soon moved up spring break to give schools time to intensify preparations, including all-out efforts to get devices and Wi-Fi into homes. ""This wasn't about whether we'll do it or not,"" said the state's commissioner of education, Angelica Infante-Green. ""That never crossed our minds. It was about, 'How will we do it?' "" Districts need to try things before they're fully worked out, said Chelsea Waite, a research fellow at the Christensen Institute who focuses on personalized learning. That demands a fluid, iterative approach, one that seeks and adjusts to feedback. For example, in New Jersey, the Morris School District's ""virtual learning hub"" includes surveys, divided by grade level, that ask parents how things are going (how much help children need from them or older siblings, for example, and whether the resources are easily accessible and the workload seems appropriate). And when teachers try out digital techniques learned from the district's online professional development offerings, they can share their problems and successes during daily virtual meetings with their principals, who themselves have regular check-ins with the district's central office.

""We're creating a feedback loop so we make sure that we're seeing our situation clearly,"" said the Morris superintendent, Mackey Pendergrast. ""We said, 'Let's do this in baby steps.'"" In some districts, teachers and staff spend hours every day reaching out to students and their families, many of whom are stretched thin by job losses, child care stress, overdue rent and health worries that can take precedence over learning. The most important thing, said Mr. Barbour of Touro University, ""is to reassure these kids that there's someone out there -- whether it's on the other end of an email, a phone call or an online learning tool -- who cares about them and wants them to learn and succeed."" It's not just the teacher-student relationships that need bolstering. By default, parents and guardians are now being called on to help students stay on task or deal with real-time learning difficulties, despite the challenges they themselves face. Some students are caring for younger siblings; some parents need school messages translated into other languages. All parents need guidance from education professionals, said Mr. Kossakoski, ""to help them understand how they can help."" Teachers and administrators need to check in with each other, too, as they confront this crisis while siloed at home, often with their own stir-crazy children and the overarching stress and worry of a deadly pandemic. ""We flipped this switch almost literally overnight,"" Ms. Swanson said. ""We need to continually talk to our teachers about giving them grace. We don't expect you to be experts in this right away."" She added: ""That's a tough message for teachers, because they want to be perfect. But that's not possible.""

Opinion,"Live From D.C., It's the Supreme Court!",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/opinion/supreme-court-coronavirus-telephone.html,"The query hung in the staticky silence for what felt like an eternity, although it was probably less than 10 seconds. It sounded like any delay on any of a million conference calls happening daily across America during the coronavirus pandemic. Only this question was coming from the chief justice of the United States, John G. Roberts Jr., who was trying to locate his colleague Justice Sonia Sotomayor during the Supreme Court's first oral argument to be held over the telephone. The hearing was also broadcast live to the world, another first. Various scenarios presented themselves: Perhaps Justice Sotomayor had lost her connection to the call. Perhaps she was making a sandwich and had forgotten to unmute her phone. Suddenly her voice came crackling through the line. ""I'm sorry, Chief,"" she said, before turning to interrogate Erica Ross, one of the lawyers on the call. In normal times, the court's routine on argument days is as strictly choreographed as a religious service -- the lawyers waiting patiently at their tables, the great hall filled with hundreds of members of the public, all sitting dutifully on long wooden benches, whispering to one another, until the buzzer sounds at 10 a.m. on the dot, and everyone rises as the justices emerge from behind a curtain to take their assigned seats.

So it was tempting on Monday morning to imagine where, exactly, everyone was. Were the justices sitting on their respective living room couches, clad in black bathrobes? Were the lawyers standing at lecterns built of empty Amazon boxes, speaking to cutouts of the justices taped to the fridge? Like so much else that we thought would never happen and yet suddenly has, it was an unprecedented moment. It was also, as Supreme Court arguments go, largely forgettable. Monday's case, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office v. Booking.com, involved the question of whether a business could trademark a generic name by adding "".com"" to the end of it -- not an issue that galvanizes the American public. (The justices are hearing seven more arguments over the next two weeks.) Following the marshal's customary introduction of the justices -- ""The honorable, the chief justice and associate justices of the United States Supreme Court. Oyez, Oyez, Oyez!"" -- Chief Justice Roberts began speaking, his voice slightly tense and echoing. The discussion among the justices and the lawyers for both sides then veered quickly into what Justice Antonin Scalia, arguing against live broadcasts about four years before his death, called ""all sorts of dull stuff that only a lawyer could understand and perhaps get interested in."" Anyone who wasn't turned off by the arcane topic of trademark law might have been by the less-than-ideal sound quality, which, as with much about the Supreme Court, was both charming and irritating. There's no magic to streaming oral arguments live; federal appeals courts and state supreme courts around the country have been doing it for years. The nation's highest court, however, has steadfastly resisted. Its only concessions to 21st-century technology have been to release same-day transcripts of oral arguments on the court's website and audio recordings of those arguments at the end of each week.

It's especially frustrating because every current sitting justice previously supported broadcasting arguments, but all overruled themselves after joining the court. ""The day you see a camera coming into our courtroom, it's going to roll over my dead body,"" retired Justice David Souter once told a House subcommittee. ""It's incredibly overdue,"" said Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, a nonprofit that has pushed for the justices to broadcast the arguments live. ""It's not that hard. I think maybe it's a generational thing, but the Supreme Court is finally realizing that this is a very basic and well-understood way that government officials interact with and give access to the public. ""I'm just hopeful that the justices themselves have a positive reaction to it, because it's going to be a little different for them as well."" Alas, Chief Justice Roberts seemed intent on acting as though nothing was out of the ordinary. He kept the arguments moving at a brisk clip, interrupting the lawyers regularly to ensure that each justice had a chance to speak. Even the famously silent Clarence Thomas asked questions, which he has now done only three times in the last decade. Hearing his rumbling baritone in real time was as jarring as the fact of the broadcast itself. Monday's arguments raised another question: Is the Supreme Court a place or a process? On one hand, it's oddly powerful to hear the often-dreary business of government being conducted live, even though we have been watching the other branches do it for decades. Even if most Americans have neither the time nor the desire to listen to hourlong legal debates, ""at least we should have that opportunity as taxpayers in a democracy,"" said Mr. Roth. ""If you have a public exercise of public officials and modern technology affords the ability to hear them live, that live access should not be withheld."" After listening to the arguments on Monday, it was hard to see what the big deal was. On the other hand, I sympathize with the justices' ambivalence. Having attended many arguments over the past seven years, I know the irreplaceable quality of watching justice play out live in a room filled with people -- a physical space where we go to resolve our disputes without resorting to violence.

The court's authority, and thus its power to command obedience, derives in part from its mystique, which explains why its members have so jealously guarded their distance. Will that authority be diminished when all Americans are able to listen to the justices doing their job in real time, on scratchy conference calls stripped of the pomp and grandeur of the courtroom? On balance, I think not. There are plenty of ways for the justices to convey the gravity of their role even in these changed circumstances. Before Monday's argument, Mr. Roth was hoping Chief Justice Roberts would take this rare opportunity to offer a brief civics lesson to Americans -- ""to explain rules of the game,"" as Mr. Roth said. For example, when the justices interrupt the lawyers, as they often do, ""they aren't trying to be mean, or to make the lawyers look silly."" Chief justices and judges on other courts have done this to good effect, Mr. Roth said. ""Most Americans' understanding of court is from TV, which is almost always trial courts."" But in the Supreme Court, as in all other appeals courts, ""there's no jury, no swearing in of witnesses."" As it turned out, Chief Justice Roberts made no acknowledgment of the situation, offered no national civics lesson. In fact, a person reading the transcript would have no indication that anything was amiss, with the possible exception of a comment by Lisa Blatt, a veteran of the Supreme Court bar who was representing Booking.com. ""I have searched every grocerystore.com looking for toilet paper,"" Ms. Blatt told the justices at one point. (""The last time 'toilet paper' was mentioned in a #SCOTUS argument was 1987,"" tweeted Tony Mauro, a longtime Supreme Court correspondent for The National Law Journal.) In the end it was left to Justice Stephen Breyer, among the chattiest and most informal of the justices, to inject some humanity into the proceedings. After beginning his first question to Ms. Ross, the government's lawyer, he stopped himself, gave a laugh and said, ""Good morning, anyway!"" ""Good morning,"" Ms. Ross replied with what sounded, through the static, like a small sigh of relief.","The court heard oral arguments remotely, and broadcast the audio live, for the first time Monday. It was a spectacle made for the radio age.",cac35715-869d-57e1-9bc7-d780fa935371,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/04/opinion/04wegman1/04wegman1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=8728e3534f337098849d426da628c22878e920bd4c270ff08112cb150c5ac475&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Supreme Court building in Washington.,cac35715-869d-57e1-9bc7-d780fa935371,N24News/imgs/cac35715-869d-57e1-9bc7-d780fa935371.jpg,11
Opinion,Trump Forecasts His Own Fraud,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/02/opinion/trump-2020-election.html,"This election is in danger of being stolen. By Donald Trump. Trump is a win-at-all-costs kind of operator. For him, the rules are like rubber, not fixed but bendable. All structures -- laws, conventions, norms -- exist for others, those not slick and sly enough to evade them, those not craven enough to break them. Trump is showing anyone who is willing to see it, in every way possible, that he is willing to do anything to win re-election, and will cry foul if he doesn't, a scenario that could cause an unprecedented national crisis. Trump has been on a rampage over voting by mail. Last week he tweeted: ""With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???"" Setting aside the fact that Trump has no power to delay the election, he is clearly seeking to undermine the legitimacy of the outcome should he lose. If he wins, he'll say he did so in spite of fraud, and if he loses, he'll claim he did so because of it.

In Trump's world, he is never to blame for failure. He is the best, the greatest ever, like no one has ever seen before. He doesn't fail. In reality, his life is chock-full of failure. At the same time Trump is attacking voting by mail, he is undermining the mechanism by which it would be done: the United States Postal Service. This is fueling concerns by many that the Postal Service is being damaged precisely because of Trump opposition to mail-in voting. As Barack Obama said in his eulogy for John Lewis: ""But even as we sit here, there are those in power who are doing their darnedest to discourage people from voting by closing polling locations, and targeting minorities and students with restrictive I.D. laws, and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision, even undermining the Postal Service in the run-up to an election that is going to be dependent on mailed-in ballots so people don't get sick."" Trump is afraid of what the data say: according to a May Gallup poll, 83 percent of Democrats would favor their state allowing all voters to vote by mail or absentee ballot in this year's presidential election, while only 40 percent of Republicans would. Trump wants to suppress the votes of those opposed to him because he fears there won't be enough votes in support of him.

Polls now consistently show him losing to Joe Biden, not only nationally but also in battleground states. These polls aren't enough to lock in a victory for Biden, but they have been enough to rattle Trump. A couple of weeks ago, Trump even suggested in an interview with Fox News's Chris Wallace that he may not accept the election results in November, saying, ""I think mail-in voting is going to rig the election, I really do."" When Wallace pressed and asked specifically if Trump was suggesting that he might not accept the election results, Trump said, ""I have to see."" For months now people have been gaming out what will happen if Trump lost the election, doesn't concede and refuses to leave the White House. One concern is that he might view the results as invalid and challenge the election in court, which could lead to protracted litigation. Trump hinted at the prospect of litigation last week, when he said he wanted to know the winner of the election on election night, adding, ""I don't want to see that take place in a week after Nov. 3, or a month or, frankly, with litigation and everything else that can happen, years."" This could happen. We should put nothing past this man. The words ""far-fetched"" and ""outlandish"" don't exist in the Trump universe.

This is a man who, during the last election, invited assistance from Russia. Since taking office, he has repeatedly doubted or refused to accept his own intelligence services' conclusion about Russian interference in that election. He has met privately with Putin without the world knowing fully what was discussed. He has instituted policies favorable to Russia. He was even impeached over issues surrounding the assistance from Russia. And yet, he has said that he would accept assistance from foreign governments again. And yet, when it was reported that there was some intelligence that Russia may have placed a bounty on our troops, Trump refused to condemn that and said that he didn't even raise the topic in a discussion with Putin. All of this was unfathomable just a few years ago, and now it's the reality we are all living. There are no norms under Trump but the consistently abhorrent. Put nothing past Trump, not even the destruction of the American electoral process. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Media,Trump Wants to Discredit the Election. This Nerd Could Stop Him.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/27/business/media/trump-election-fox-news.html,"[Follow our latest coverage of the Biden vs. Trump 2020 election.] The Fox Corporation these days reminds me a bit of America: The elites have lost control, and partisan noise drowns out almost everything. But there are pockets where traditionalists cling to fading norms. One of those pockets is a new office on the third floor of Fox's headquarters on the Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan, known by employees as the ""nerdquarium."" That's where a prickly, bespectacled 65-year-old named Arnon Mishkin and his staff of data-crunching wonks will come to work on Election Day. And this Nov. 3, Mr. Mishkin may be the last bulwark against the most frightening prophecies of electoral insanity.

""There will be no one putting their finger on the scale in either direction,"" he told me with matter-of-fact confidence in an interview on Friday from his Upper West Side home. Election night is shaping up as a dangerous, high-pressure moment for the country and for television journalists, who traditionally play an outsize role in telling Americans who won our decentralized, locally run national elections.  But at no place is the tension higher than at Fox, which has served as platform, megaphone and cheerleading squad for Mr. Trump and his counterfactual claims for the better part of four years. And on the night when the stakes are highest, it is up to the unassuming Mr. Mishkin, more than any other individual, to represent reality. ""We're going to come under enormous pressure,"" another top Fox figure told me of election night. The nightmare scenario goes like this: It's a close race, and Mr. Trump leads in the early vote count in Pennsylvania, and needs just that state to win the election. Tens of thousands of votes are still untallied, and the counting may take weeks -- but Mr. Trump has already declared that he's been re-elected. He's demanding that Fox do the same, making calls to Fox Corporation's co-chairman, Rupert Murdoch, or working back channels to the executive who effectively runs the network, Viet Dinh. Mr. Trump's most loyal acolytes at Fox, the prime-time hosts Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, are backing the president's claim on the air. And Fox faces the temptation it often succumbs to: offering its audience the alternate reality it wants. Arnon Mishkin runs Fox News's ""decision desk,"" the team responsible for telling Fox viewers who won the election. ""There's real concern about the choice Fox is going to make given its own history,"" said Vanita Gupta, the president and chief executive officer of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, which is among the groups pushing journalists to take their time in covering the vote counts. ""Are they going to be a state media organ and sabotage our democracy in the process, or are they going to show up as media that is going to be thoughtful and careful about prematurely calling results before all the ballots are counted?""

A Slate headline last week put it bluntly: ""The Fox News Decision Desk Controls the Fate of American Democracy."" I spoke this past week to Mr. Mishkin and other current and former Fox News employees about whether that nightmare situation could play out. Somewhat to my surprise, many said that while they expect Mr. Mishkin to have to compete with Mr. Hannity and others who will echo Mr. Trump's claims, Fox's bizarre and chaotic internal politics will probably protect him and the decision desk from any actual interference. The problem for a meddling president is this: If you want to speak to Fox News -- whom do you call? Outsiders often view Rupert Murdoch's right-wing media empire as a well-oiled machine, but it is, in truth, a shambolic, shoot-from-the-hip organization. These days, it seems more like the creaky court of an aging monarch than a high-powered or efficient corporation.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. It's been unclear who is in charge at Fox since the network's founder, Roger Ailes, resigned in disgrace in 2016. Is it Mr. Murdoch, 89, who has been weathering the pandemic in his country manor in Oxfordshire and who is often asleep by prime time in the United States? Or his son Lachlan, Fox Corporation's chief executive? A better bet may be Mr. Dinh, the little-known but influential insider who runs Fox News's parent company for the younger Mr. Murdoch. Or perhaps the network's chief executive, Suzanne Scott, though Fox insiders say she has long since given up on trying to control her on-air talent? Mr. Mishkin, for his part, operates independently with an eight-man (they are all men) team of statisticians, political scientists, pollsters and journalists. When I asked him whom he reports to, he fell silent and then tried to remember who approves his expenses. ""The weird thing is the decision desk doesn't really report to anyone,"" a person familiar with the operation told me, on the condition of anonymity so as not to be seen as undermining Fox's attempts to present itself as a normal news organization. Mr. Mishkin said that executives in Fox's control room can ""kick the tires"" when he makes a call. (Mr. Mishkin's team not only declares a winner of the presidential contest, it calls the results in individual states based on live vote tallies and data analysis.) Fox's senior executive vice president of corporate communications, Irena Briganti, who participated in my call with Mr. Mishkin, said the decision desk is part of the news division.

Mr. Mishkin and Fox's chief pollster, Dana Blanton, are part of the wonky, reality-based community of election nerds who populate similar decision desks and polling operations across the media. Mr. Mishkin and Ms. Blanton have also led the charge to create an alternative to traditional exit polls, the large surveys of voters conducted before and on Election Day called VoteCast, in partnership with The Associated Press. The emergence of Twitter has made much of their work transparent to anyone who wants to follow their abstruse if enthusiastic Election Day debates about historical voting patterns in key precincts in Waukesha County, Wis. And it is clear that Fox's operation is well-regarded by its peers. ""Arnon and all the people working on their data are really scrupulous, and I think they do a very good job,"" says Ariel Edwards-Levy, the HuffPost's polling editor. Mr. Mishkin came to Fox in 1998 with an elite resume -- Andover, Yale, Harvard Business School -- and a background in political polling. He got his start working for the New York political consultant David Garth, who helped elect Mayors Edward I. Koch and Rudy Giuliani and advised a local developer named Donald Trump. Mr. Garth also worked for Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles in his failed race for governor of California in 1982. That election gave birth to the idea of a ""Bradley effect,"" in which white voters lie to pollsters about their intention to support a Black candidate, concealing their racial prejudice and overstating the candidate's standing. Not everyone believes that happened to Mr. Bradley, but Mr. Mishkin said he learned back then that voters disguise their feelings to pollsters. Sometimes they describe themselves as undecided rather than acknowledging that they are backing a ""socially undesirable"" candidate -- which, he said, helps explain why polls failed to predict Mr. Trump's victory in 2016.

Mr. Mishkin kept his Fox role more or less secret for years because he didn't want it to interfere with his partnership at Boston Consulting Group, where he advised media companies like Forbes and The Associated Press on internet marketing and strategy. He quietly took over at Fox when his friend and predecessor, John Ellis, George W. Bush's first cousin, stepped aside after the messy 2000 election. Many of Mr. Mishkin's friends and business partners told me they had no idea he was even at Fox until election night 2012, when an unexpected and memorable drama unfolded on air: Karl Rove, a Fox commentator, was emphatically objecting to the decision desk's call that Barack Obama would win Ohio, and thus, be re-elected. As Mr. Rove fulminated, an anchor, Megyn Kelly, walked off the set, cameras in tow, down a long corridor to Mr. Mishkin's operation, and demanded to know if he was confident in his call. An unwavering if not-quite-camera ready Mr. Mishkin, his hands in his pockets, calmly pronounced himself ""99.95 percent"" certain that Mr. Obama had won. Fox stuck with his call -- and with reality.

""It was like Clark Kent and Superman -- I didn't know he was central to that until Megyn walked down the hall,"" said Jim Kennedy, the senior vice president for strategy and enterprise development at The Associated Press, who has worked with Mr. Mishkin as a consultant for years. ""That's when I realized -- that's Arnon."" Mr. Mishkin was running the desk with equal confidence in the summer of 2016, when, a former colleague said, he and his team were dismissive of Mr. Trump's chances. Eric Bolling, then a Fox Business host who would visit their ""nerdquarium"" to argue Mr. Trump's case, complained that the nerds weren't taking the possibility of a Trump victory seriously enough, the former colleague said. Mr. Mishkin says that, to the contrary, he took Mr. Trump's prospects so seriously that one of his daughters told him that he was beginning to sound like the innumerate Trump booster Bill Mitchell. This time around, Mr. Mishkin has been skeptical of Mr. Trump's chances on social media and in occasional Fox appearances, echoing Ms. Blanton's polls. One of his friends told me that he's expressed frustration that Fox won't put those views on the air. When I asked him about that, he switched to consultant-speak. ""As media companies become more and more reliant on subscription revenue, they evolve to telling the readers what they want to hear, and I think that's true of frankly every journalistic organization in America,"" he said. Mr. Mishkin told me nobody at Fox ever asked him whom he voted for in 2016. Now the question is whether the network will let him do his job when it really matters, on election night. Last time around, 12 million viewers tuned in. Ms. Kelly, who is now the host of an independent podcast, said she was confident he would. ""That night, you're going to be able to trust who's out there because it's run by the journalists at Fox News,"" Ms. Kelly said. If that doesn't give you total confidence, Mr. Mishkin's friends say his unbending personal qualities ought to. This is a man who, after asking for a show of hands from his team, confidently faced down Mr. Rove. ""It wouldn't matter who's running Fox or what Donald Trump wants,"" said his business partner and a Yale connection, Samuel O.J. Spivy. ""What Arnon is interested in is who is the winner.""","Fox News, the president's favored network, will face enormous pressure to call the election for Mr. Trump.

It was not a given that Steve Hilton, the conservative Fox News host, and Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor who worked in the Obama White House, would get along. But when they met by chance at a cocktail party in Washington last year, they quickly landed on one surprisingly strong point of agreement: It was time to break up Big Tech. ""We thought the same way,"" Mr. Hilton said. Mr. Wu, who is also a contributing opinion writer for The New York Times, agreed. ""There's unusual constituencies arising,"" he said. He later went on Mr. Hilton's show, ""The Next Revolution,"" for a congenial interview. The antitrust movement has been revived by a bipartisan loathing of Big Tech that extends beyond lawmakers to the furthest firmaments of the right and the left.

On one side is the progressive left, whose members have been appalled by Facebook's handling of pro-Trump Russian disinformation campaigns and Silicon Valley's consolidated power. On the other side is the Trumpist right, whose members see the power of social media companies to ban content as censorship and worry that the arteries of communication are controlled by young liberals. The common cause has made for some strange new bedfellows. The left and the right now often have similar anti-tech talking points on cable news and at congressional hearings. Conservatives are showing up at largely liberal conferences, while liberals are going on conservative TV shows. On Tuesday, that alignment will be evident at an antitrust hearing on Capitol Hill featuring executives from Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple, as well as policy experts like Mr. Wu. The hearing, held by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, will examine ""the impact of market power of online platforms on innovation and entrepreneurship."" ""To the bewilderment of many observers, the ascendant pressures for antitrust reforms are flowing from both wings of the political spectrum,"" Daniel A. Crane, a law professor at the University of Michigan, wrote last year in a paper called ""Antitrust's Unconventional Politics."" Now those who have found mutual understanding need to figure out if they can actually get along. It is not easy. Often, it is awkward.

""I think we should be skeptical,"" said Sabeel Rahman, the president of the progressive think tank Demos and an associate law professor at Brooklyn Law School. ""What are the coalitions that we ought to embrace? Who's the we?"" Mr. Rahman said that he was wary of these new conservative allies and that progressives in the movement needed to be cautious. Yes, they both want to take power out of the hands of large tech companies -- but then the two sides have to agree on whose hands that power falls into. ""How do we operationalize this? Who's doing the moderating? Are these new allies coming in good faith?"" Mr. Rahman asked. ""The devil's in the details.""

The detail here is who exactly should be in charge of a company like Facebook, if it is not Mark Zuckerberg. The two sides may both want third-party ombudsmen of some sort, but agreement seems to fall apart beyond that. ""Most people getting involved haven't really gamed out what this means,"" said Katy Glenn Bass, the research director at the Knight First Amendment Institute, an advocacy group for free speech. Regulation of online speech is not exclusively an antitrust concern, but today these threads are becoming interwoven. Critics argue that big tech companies need to be broken up or regulated because they are suppressing speech.

Ms. Bass, who is organizing a Knight Institute symposium in October on tech giants, monopoly power and public discourse, said she worried that popular enthusiasm for aggressive regulation of speech on the platforms could get out of hand. She worries that now arguments for moderating speech are coming from groups that once stood against government intervention. [Update, July 15, 2019: After this article was published, Ms. Bass said her Knight Institute symposium was being moved from October to November.] ""The idea that these platforms should be pretty tightly regulated on what speech they can host is not a traditional conservative argument,"" Ms. Bass said. ""This has all been a real whiplash."" A case in point: On Thursday , The Washington Post published an essay by Charlie Kirk, the president of Turning Point USA, a group for young conservatives, proposing that digital platforms be regulated the way publishers are. ""Fighting back against private companies with governmental action is a politically and ideologically fraught idea for those of us on the right,"" he wrote. But he went on to add, ""There is now ample reason to believe the market's normal corrective powers are being blocked by anti-competitive forces."" Traditional conservatives said they were feeling the whiplash. James Pethokoukis, an analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a pro-market think tank, was at a party this spring that included Republican donors in Washington when the conversation took a turn toward big tech companies. ""They were talking about breaking them up, turning them into utilities,"" Mr. Pethokoukis said. ""It's a breathtaking change from even a year ago."" He was shocked. To him these companies were American jewels and some of the best bulwarks against rising power abroad. He has since been writing against the movement with pieces like ""The Astonishingly Weak Antitrust Case Against Facebook, Google, and Amazon.""

Tech bias has been a longtime concern for the right, and Stephen K. Bannon, President Trump's former chief strategist, frequently mentioned it. Little came of it. Now the movement is finding more mainstream allies. Mr. Kirk and others who have complained of an anti-conservative bias by Facebook, Google and Twitter attended a social media summit at the White House on Thursday . At the event, Mr. Trump accused the companies of exhibiting ""terrible bias"" and said he was calling representatives from all of them to the White House over the next month. On Friday, Mr. Trump took the tech companies to task again, calling them ""crooked"" and ""dishonest"" and adding that ""something is going to be done."" ""In my circles right now,"" Mr. Pethokoukis said, ""if you say, 'I don't think we're seeing systemic bias against conservatives,' it's like they wonder about your sanity."" Matt Stoller, a former Democratic congressional staff member who is now at the antimonopoly think tank Open Markets Institute, which leans liberal, said he noticed the same thing. ""The white supremacists liked to appropriate this language around antimonopoly and free speech,"" said Mr. Stoller, who has written a book on the antimonopoly movement, ""Goliath."" ""But now there are real networks on the right that are not white supremacist networks, and the people in them are genuinely concerned about the power of Big Tech."" He said he was having to reassess his relationships with conservatives. ""I always knew we were aiming at different things,"" he said. ""Now, we have some of the same goals.""",Conservatives are showing up at largely liberal conferences to call for breaking up Facebook and Google. Liberals are going on conservative TV shows to do the same.

Travel,"In the Yakima Valley, Serious Wines and Sweeping Vistas",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/18/travel/yakima-valley-wines.html,"Travelers to the Pacific Northwest are sometimes lured by postcard promises of orca whales or the Space Needle against a backdrop of lofty peaks. But what too few tourists learn is this: The massive dome of Mount Rainier -- arguably the showiest of Washington State's majestic Cascades -- is best beheld not from Puget Sound but from the high desert east of the mountains. There, from points up and down the Yakima Valley, Rainier and its sister summit, Mount Adams, loom like giant snow cones above swaths of irrigated farmland and sagebrush-covered range. A world away from Seattle, the ""dry side,"" as it is known to Washingtonians, is home to more tractors than Teslas. In addition to broad vistas and respite from rain, the region boasts a booming wine industry: The pioneers who first took a chance on planting Vitis vinifera -- in a place where Concord grapes were king -- have in one generation seen the number of wineries in Washington State swell from a handful to nearly 1,000. Seattleites increasingly find sport in seeking out a few rays of sunshine and returning with a few cases of wine.

Napa it is not. Loamy soil, prodigious snowmelt and lots of sunshine sustain a richly diverse agriculture whose color and character seem more aligned with parts of the Midwest than the ""Left Coast."" Roughly 75 percent of the nation's hops are grown here, and the loopy architecture of hop yards -- a giant cat's cradle of stilts and strings -- is a common sight. Pink Lady apple trees, pruned like poodles, rival the topiaries at Versailles. The valley is also the nation's leading producer of spearmint and peppermint oil; carpets of dark green leaves, destined for toothpaste and chewing gum, line the roadsides. At the Darigold dairy plant in Sunnyside, legend has it that the annual production of cheese blocks, if stacked vertically, would exceed the elevation of Rainier (14,411 feet).

Visitors to the region are in for a treat even before they get there: The drives from Seattle, over the shoulder of Rainier, and from Portland, Ore., up the mighty Columbia River Gorge, feature scenes that look like pages ripped from a grade-school geography text. From Seattle, consider a detour onto the Yakima River Canyon Scenic Byway. Along the route, the Roza Dam, built in 1939, diverts the irrigation water that makes it all possible. (Flights into Pasco, where the airport has just undergone a major expansion, can offer glimpses of waving wheat and black polka dots that are Angus cows.) I first came to the valley in the early 1980s, when my sister and her husband started a small winery there. At a lawn party to mark the release of their first merlot, we ate sweet native shrimp that my brother had netted in Puget Sound; tender asparagus from a nearby farm stand (locals will not eat asparagus unless it is picked that day); and little lamb chops, grilled to perfection by a friend whose Spanish ancestors ran sheep in Eastern Washington in the early 1900s. I have been returning as often as I can ever since.

My first stop was Barnard Griffin, a trailblazer founded in 1983 on the outskirts of Richland, in the shadow of Badger Mountain. I piggybacked on a bus-tour tasting in full swing, and took special note of the winemaker Rob Griffin's peachy 2014 chardonnay, which scored 94 points at the San Francisco International Wine Competition (I did a double-take at the price, just $14), and his juicy 2015 Sangiovese rose, which won the ""pink"" sweepstakes award at the San Francisco Chronicle Wine Competition. I sampled six wines (the tasting fee of $10 is refunded if you buy wine). The Kitchen, next to the pergola-fronted tasting room, serves a ""farm to fork"" menu Tuesday to Saturday, starting at noon. I poked my head into db Studio, where Mr. Griffin's wife, Deborah Barnard, makes exuberant art glass and teaches classes to aspiring glaziers. Up the road in Benton City, high above the modest stucco bungalows that skirt the base of Red Mountain, is the glamorous Col Solare, a joint effort of the Italian wine giant Marchesi Antinori and Ste. Michelle Wine Estates, the largest producer in the state. I joined a tour that began in the vineyard out front, where our guide joked about the winery's ""lakefront property,"" an allusion to the cataclysmic Missoula floods that deposited local sediments favorable to growing grapes. The wines -- red and red only -- are made from Bordeaux varietals (and a touch of syrah); they command big prices -- and get big scores. In the svelte tasting room, a flight of three wines was $17 (the selection included the formidable 2012 and 2013 Col Solare blends, which retail for $75). Darel Allwine oversees the winemaking; his 2014 Shining Hill, at a lower price ($40), had notes of Bing cherry and licorice. For snacking, marcona almonds seasoned with white truffle salt are $9; the charcuterie plate is $24. Moving on up to Prosser, I crossed the railroad tracks near the Tree Top fruit-processing plant to Mercer Estates. The Mercer family has farmed in the valley since the 1880s but has only lately come to winemaking; they grow every grape that goes into their proprietary wines, mostly on the pretty slopes and plateaus of the nearby Horse Heaven Hills. The winemaker Jessica Munnell, who is native to the valley, makes some beautiful reds, but I especially liked her brisk sauvignon blanc; cantaloupe-scented viognier; and super fruity Grenache rose. Mercer has come away from the annual wine competition at the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo with a trove of prizes -- saddles, bridles and ornate silver buckles; these add a certain dash to the handsome tasting room, where the fee to taste is $5.

I headed next to the top of the valley, to Treveri Cellars, known for its sparkling wines. With the stone-and-timber heft of a ski lodge, the tasting room was at capacity at noon (a glorious outdoor patio, bubbly cocktails and a ""small bites"" menu are draws). Jurgen Grieb, the winemaker, studied methode champenoise in his native Germany; he makes impeccable effervescent versions of riesling, gewurztraminer and Muller-Thurgau (as well as traditional blanc de blancs, blanc de noirs and a delicious sparkling rose of chardonnay and syrah). At $15 to $20, these are bargain bubbles. Once a month, visitors can tour the facility and disgorge their own bottle before taking it home ($50, by appointment). Just beyond Treveri, a single-track road leads through cherry and nectarine orchards to Owen Roe. A striking barn-red metal building, set in a cup-shaped dale, houses the winery and tasting room. The surrounding slopes are studded with volcanic outcroppings and planted with roller-coaster rows of red-wine grapes. The winemaker David O'Reilly, who has a devoted following for his Oregon pinot noirs, blended his first Washington wines here in 2013. I tasted a flight of five wines for $10, which I applied to a bottle of his dense, luscious 2013 Union Gap Vineyard syrah ($55). Bottlings fall into three price tiers, and while many of the names are a hoot -- the value-driven Corvidae line honors the pesky crows and magpies that raid the vineyards with wines called Mirth and WiseGuy -- the pursuit of quality is serious. Picnicking is encouraged (a commercial kitchen is in the works). A tour of the winery, by reservation ($20), includes a private tasting and a ride through the estate's organically farmed vineyard in an all-terrain Pinzgauer.","Tasting rooms without attitude, wine-friendly menus and fields of wheat and spearmint are among the many charms of this region of Washington State.",42b7bc3a-8023-5cc1-99fa-1abda45a7ee9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/20/travel/20YAKIMA1/20YAKIMA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=a83d24e55c7fec2d4e026ea11022bf040daa45f0e1a2be26c18853f97a083a6c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Yakima River as it tumbles through a canyon before watering crops in the valley below.,42b7bc3a-8023-5cc1-99fa-1abda45a7ee9,N24News/imgs/42b7bc3a-8023-5cc1-99fa-1abda45a7ee9.jpg,4
Technology,Microsoft Looks to Regain Lost Ground in the Classroom,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/technology/microsoft-google-educational-sales.html,"REDMOND, Wash. -- Last week, Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, slipped on a glove made of cardboard and clenched his hand into a fist, causing a robotic hand with fingers made of drinking straws to mimic his movements. The glove was one of several engineering projects built in a makeshift laboratory on Microsoft's campus. The company spent the last year talking to thousands of teachers and designing high-tech experiments that require mostly low-cost parts. It will give the designs to schools for free so teachers can use them in their lesson plans. The projects are part of a major push the company announced Tuesday at an event in New York to make its products more attractive to school administrators, students and teachers. The push includes a new version of Microsoft's Windows operating system for classrooms, tweaks to its Office applications and a new Surface laptop for students in a collection of bold colors. While the dollars available in the education market are compelling enough for big technology companies like Microsoft, classrooms also offer an opportunity to make a first impression on young people who could eventually buy their products.

Microsoft remains a force in classrooms around the globe. But the company's relevance in schools in the United States is in jeopardy after years of progress by Google, whose software dominates sales of new devices in schools. Google has gained ground in public schools by offering a tightly connected system of free classroom apps, lower-cost laptops called Chromebooks and a web-based console that allows schools to remotely manage thousands of student devices. Industry analysts said Microsoft's initiative was the company's first credible response to Google's recent encroachment into education.

""I am not going to predict that they are going to take back the entire market or anything like that, but this is the best move that I could have seen them making against Chromebooks,"" said J. P. Gownder, a technology analyst at Forrester Research, a market research company, where Microsoft is one of his clients. Some of Microsoft's moves are intended to make its products more appealing to educators by simplifying them and, in some ways, restricting them. The new version of its operating system, Windows 10 S, will run only applications that have been vetted by Microsoft and placed in its online app store, to prevent students from downloading software that could slow the performance of their computers. Microsoft has also devised a way for schools to get new computers running on a network quickly, without manually configuring each one, by plugging in a USB memory stick. A Microsoft management system called Intune for Education allows schools to set further limits on classroom computers, like locking them down so students cannot cheat by surfing the web during tests.

The tools are designed to be easy enough for teachers to use, since many schools do not have dedicated technology administrators. ""Sometimes school districts aren't managing the devices,"" said Terry Myerson, a Microsoft executive vice president. ""Teachers are on the front lines of managing the devices."" The company is also making full versions of its Office applications, rather than more limited web versions, available to schools for free. It has modified a version of its Microsoft Teams group-chat tool so teachers can collaborate with students. It is also waiving the cost of an educational version of Minecraft, a popular video game it owns, for the first year schools use it. While much of Microsoft's focus is on software that makes using inexpensive devices -- often in the $200 to $300 range -- more palatable, the company will also release a $999 device called the Surface Laptop, a twist on its Surface tablets. The device will run Windows 10 S.

Tech companies are fiercely competing for business in primary and secondary schools in the United States, a technology market expected to reach $21 billion by 2020, according to estimates from Ibis Capital, a technology investment firm, and EdtechXGlobal, a conference company. It is a matter of some urgency for Microsoft. Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the 12.6 million mobile devices shipped to primary and secondary schools in the United States last year, compared with less than 1 percent in 2012, according to Futuresource Consulting, a research company. By contrast, Windows laptops and tablets made up 21.6 percent of the mobile-device shipments to schools in the United States last year, down from about 43 percent in 2012. Outside the United States, Microsoft Windows devices accounted for about 64 percent of mobile-device shipments to schools last year, Futuresource said.

Apple has similarly experienced a steep Chromebook-related decline in shipments of iPads and Mac laptops to schools. Its mobile shipments to schools fell to 19 percent in the United States last year, from 52 percent in 2012. Like Microsoft, Apple is not taking the Chromebook phenomenon lying down. Apple recently introduced an iPad management app called Classroom, which enables teachers to assign shared iPads to students and create virtual classrooms to guide students through lessons. Apple also introduced lower pricing for educational institutions on its newest iPad model. The iPad starts at $329 for consumers and at $299 for schools. Google began to take off in schools in the United States in 2013, when school districts started making bulk purchases of Chromebooks, which are now made by Acer, Asus, Lenovo, HP and other computer makers. Because the laptops run on Google's Chrome operating system and revolve around web-based apps, they are often cheaper, easier to manage and faster to boot up than traditional laptops.

By contrast, Mr. Gownder of Forrester Research said that Microsoft software is so feature-rich that technology experts in many school districts have had to devote their summers to preparing Windows laptops for students one device at a time. And some of Microsoft's initial attempts to contend with Google's rise in schools stumbled. In 2014, Microsoft announced it would be going head-to-head with Chromebooks by working with device manufacturers to introduce cheaper Windows laptops. But some schools found the lower-priced Windows devices too cheaply made to withstand student use and too low-powered to efficiently run Microsoft software. ""The cheapest of them would not work,"" said Hal Friedlander, a former chief information officer of the New York City Department of Education.

Officials at Omaha Public Schools, which spends about $570,000 annually on Microsoft software and is investing $8 million to buy students Windows devices, welcomed the company's more comprehensive approach to the classroom. About 200 teachers in the district have completed professional development activities called the Microsoft Innovative Educator program. Some of those teachers are already using the Microsoft Teams chat service with their students. ""Now it's not four or five different experiences based on which app you are using,"" said Rob Dickson, the executive director of information management services for Omaha Public Schools. ""It's a single app with all those experiences within it.""","Google, with its low-cost and easily maintained Chromebooks, has steadily taken school customers away from Microsoft.",3572bb06-ac72-56ee-8563-b3dce41a325a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/02/business/03MICROSOFT1/03MICROSOFT1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=c9b4856da4b03280b2f941489abf427c65e6204f661a3fe2f5ab8f32b2586460&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Satya Nadella, the chief executive of Microsoft, in the ""Hacking STEM"" lab at the company's campus in Redmond, Wash., on April 25.",3572bb06-ac72-56ee-8563-b3dce41a325a,N24News/imgs/3572bb06-ac72-56ee-8563-b3dce41a325a.jpg,20
Sports,Mikaela Shiffrin Wins First World Cup Race Since January,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/sports/skiing/mikaela-shiffrin-world-cup-win.html,"Calling the victory bittersweet, Mikaela Shiffrin, the two-time Olympic champion, won a World Cup giant slalom on Monday in Courchevel, France, her first time atop an Alpine podium since the accidental death of her father, Jeff, 10 months ago.

""It was a pretty incredible day, obviously,"" said Shiffrin, who was in tears during interviews at the bottom of the racecourse. ""But I'm pretty sad. I mean, it's a bit bittersweet.""

Shiffrin's last World Cup victory was on Jan. 26 in a super-G in Bulgaria, a race attended by her father, who flew home to Colorado shortly thereafter. He died on Feb. 2, and Shiffrin, then the three-time defending World Cup overall champion, did not compete again for the rest of the season.

Before Monday, she had raced three times since late November, finishing second, fourth and fifth.

Style,"Gay, Cuban and in Love",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/style/gay-cuban-and-in-love.html,"El Espace is a column dedicated to news and culture relevant to Latinx communities. Expect politics, arts, analysis, personal essays and more. ?Lo mejor? It'll be in Spanish and English, so you can forward it to your tia, your primo Lalo or anyone else (read: everyone). On April 20, 1980, Fidel Castro, then the president of Cuba, proclaimed that any citizen who wanted to leave the island could depart from the nearby port of Mariel. In the six months that followed, nearly 125,000 Cubans journeyed across the Straits of Florida, including thousands of queer men and women fleeing persecution. Casimiro Gonzalez and Manuel Rodriguez were among them. Theirs is one of the many stories highlighted in Queer Miami: A History of L.G.B.T.Q Communities, a new exhibition at the HistoryMiami Museum tied to the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall Rebellion. Using archival footage, photographs and memorabilia, the curator Julio Capo Jr., an associate professor of history at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, traces Miami's L.G.B.T.Q history (and struggles) from 1890 to the present, including how the city was shaped by Cuban immigrants.

Mr. Gonzalez and Mr. Rodriguez met in a movie theater in Havana when they were in their 20s. They arrived in the United States in 1980, and, after nearly half a century together, they married in 2015. When I spoke to them over the phone, they alternated between finishing each other's sentences and cracking jokes at the other's expense. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. What was the Cuban government's attitude toward gay people in the '70s? GONZALEZ: It wasn't safe for us. Police officers would often raid movie theaters. The lights would come on, and they'd round up anyone they didn't like the look of into buses, and haul them off to jail. They'd do that at cabarets, too. RODRIGUEZ: When Fidel Castro said people could leave, I went to the Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, and told them I stole clotheslines, that I was a homosexual and was against the revolution. I really piled it on. Afterward I hid in my house for two days, afraid to even come near the window, while I waited for my exit permit. Mobs would throw eggs or worse at people like us. Casimiro would walk to my house to see me. On the third day a police officer in a motorcycle came by and called out my name, signaling that it was time for me to go. My mother had made me a steak sandwich, but I could barely get it down. GONZALEZ: Enough talk about steak sandwiches, you're making me hungry! RODRIGUEZ: It was almost 7 p.m. when I left Cuba on May 15, 1980. They piled 289 of us on a little shrimp boat. All but around 17 of us were prisoners the government had forced the boat owner to take with him. There was no space to sit or even puke if you got seasick.

GONZALEZ: After he left I stayed in bed, chain-smoked and drank coffee. I couldn't eat anything. I finally got my exit permit 11 days later. Our boat ran out of gas and we drifted. Eventually we were rescued by an American military ship, a battleship. These doors opened up, and I was sure cannons would come out of them. Incredibly our boat went inside the belly of the ship. I thought, ""This is the end! They're going to make picadillo out of us and throw us back in the water!"" But the Americans were nice to us. They gave us something to eat, and then I had the luxury of arriving in Miami in a helicopter. RODRIGUEZ: Llego en estilo, but he didn't have a penny in his pocket. Manuel Rodriguez, left, and Casimiro Gonzalez at home in Chicago in 1980. When you arrived, the United States was on the precipice of the AIDS crisis, and homophobia was rampant, yet you were free from the neighborhood watches back home. What was that like for you? RODRIGUEZ: I remember how free I felt. The first time we went dancing, we stood with our mouths agape. Men were dancing with men, women with women. We began adapting to all these things, which were new to us. Though back then the Latino community criticized people like us, so we were still very private. None of my co-workers ever knew. GONZALEZ: He told them he was married in Cuba and that he left 40 kids behind! Things have changed so much since then. We lost so many friends to AIDS. In the days before FaceTime and email, leaving home felt more permanent. Did you ever doubt your decision to leave? At this point you've lived in the United States longer than you did Cuba -- do you feel American?","This week on El Espace: An exhibition in Miami looks back on the city's queer history, Latinx creators discuss their work and more.",8ae846f3-6c33-5dc5-a4a1-da705ffcfea4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/28/fashion/28elespace-1/28elespace-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=4d4b7ff4b6ab535a850f36d77d5f2f0a607f5066bbf73606f196e82f39ff9f5d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Cuban refugees aboard the Capt.

Sports,Antonio Brown Suspended Eight Games by the N.F.L.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/sports/football/antonio-brown-suspension-nfl.html,"The N.F.L. on Friday suspended wide receiver Antonio Brown for eight regular-season games for his role in a January dispute with a moving company employee, for which he pleaded no contest to burglary and battery charges and received two years probation. Brown was also penalized for sending threatening texts to a woman who accused him of sexual misconduct. The suspension was first reported by The Washington Post and was confirmed in a statement by the league. Brown still faces an investigation into accusations that he sexually assaulted his former trainer in 2017 and 2018. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in South Florida, where Brown has a home, remains open and the receiver could still face additional penalties pending its outcome. He has denied the accusations of sexual assault. Under the terms of the N.F.L.'s suspension, Brown will also have to participate in a counseling and treatment program. Any additional violations of the N.F.L.'s personal conduct policy ""will likely result in more significant discipline."" Friday night, Brown addressed the suspension on social media. ""I look forward to new beginnings,"" he wrote in an Instagram post. ""I appreciate the N.F.L. giving me the opportunity to work on myself and improve."" Brown will not appeal his suspension, according to his agent, Ed Wasielewski.

A seven-time Pro Bowl selection while with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Brown, 32, is an unrestricted free agent and can sign with any team. If he is signed before the start of the regular season, he could take part in his club's preseason activities, would start his suspension on Sept. 5. and could return after the team's eighth game. If he is unsigned, he would be eligible to play after the eighth week of the season. Brown was once considered one of the league's most prolific and popular players -- known for his penalty-inducing touchdown celebrations and a season on the reality TV competition ""Dancing With the Stars"" -- but his career has been in a tailspin since he walked out on the Steelers in 2018. Pittsburgh traded him to the Raiders for two draft picks in March 2019, but Oakland released him that September, after a tumultuous training camp. The New England Patriots picked him up, but after Brown lashed out against another woman who, in a Sports Illustrated story, accused him of a separate incident of sexual misconduct, the Patriots let him go. Brown competed in one game with the Patriots, scoring a touchdown. The suspension, which was announced by the N.F.L.'s special counsel for conduct, Todd Jones, comes as the league remains under scrutiny for how it has handled cases involving domestic abuse, sexual assault and harassment. Brown's case is unusual partly because he has tried to defend himself on social media. Since being released in 2019, he has said at least twice that he plans to retire from football. He has also picked fights with his employers, most notably the Raiders, who released him after a series of incidents during the off-season and training camp last year, including a dispute over the type of helmet he could wear.

In December 2019 and January 2020, Brown used social media to document domestic disputes with the mother of his children, during which police were called to his house. Brown was arrested and charged with burglary, battery and criminal mischief in late January after a dispute with a moving company employee over pay. He pleaded no contest and received two years probation, with no travel restrictions. Despite his troubles off the field, other prominent players have embraced him. Brown worked out with Washington quarterback Dwayne Haskins and Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson in separate practices, and with Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady, who played with Brown in 2019. Brown also worked out with Lamar Jackson, the star quarterback of the Baltimore Ravens, who this week publicly lobbied for the team to sign the receiver. Brown's cousin, Marquise Brown, was a standout rookie receiver for the team in the 2019 season. Since 2014, when the N.F.L. was heavily criticized for the uneven way it had handled domestic violence accusations against its players, the league has sought to strengthen its investigation department, adding former prosecutors and specialists in sexual abuse. The league no longer relies exclusively on the findings of law enforcement to determine whether to suspend a player. The league has suspended players after they have been on paid leave. For example, Kareem Hunt, who was caught on video striking a woman in February 2018, was suspended for eight games. Josh Brown, who admitted to the police that he had abused his wife, was initially suspended for one game in 2016. After additional evidence was revealed, he was suspended with pay in 2017 while the league investigated the accusations against him. In other cases, the league suspended players after they were charged with domestic abuse, sexual assault and other violent crimes.

In Antonio Brown's case, N.F.L. investigators have examined accusations made in a civil suit by his former trainer. In the suit, the trainer accused Brown of sexually assaulting her twice during training sessions in June 2017. She ended her working relationship with Brown, the lawsuit says, but several months later, when he contacted her to apologize, she relented. She was, according to the lawsuit, ""swayed by his assurance that he would cease any sexual advances.""",The All-Pro receiver was penalized for his role in a January dispute at his home and for sending threatening texts to a woman who had accused him of sexual misconduct.,48f41ec0-b2ef-5a2d-a4eb-353720c16a7d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/01/sports/31brown-suspension-print/31brown-suspension-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=d73bac939e9104ac79964845210075e237e93f8aadb177ea660cbfaa57087276&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Antonio Brown, who has been selected to seven Pro Bowls, will begin his suspension at the start of the N.F.L. season regardless of whether he is signed to a team.",48f41ec0-b2ef-5a2d-a4eb-353720c16a7d,N24News/imgs/48f41ec0-b2ef-5a2d-a4eb-353720c16a7d.jpg,9
Media,San Francisco Police Call Journalist Possible 'Co-Conspirator' in Report Leak,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/business/media/san-francisco-police-bryan-carmody-leak.html,"Ratcheting up an investigation that has been criticized by news organizations and press-freedom groups, the San Francisco Police Department said a freelance journalist who had obtained a leaked police report was a suspected ""co-conspirator"" in the purported ""theft"" of the document. The allegation, contained in a statement issued by the Police Department late Tuesday, was the first instance of law enforcement authorities describing the journalist, Bryan Carmody, as a subject of their investigation, according to Mr. Carmody's lawyer, Tom Burke. Mr. Carmody has covered news events in the Bay Area -- crime scenes, fires, car crashes -- for nearly 30 years as a self-employed journalist. In February, he obtained a police report from an unidentified person, or persons, related to the death of San Francisco's longtime public defender, Jeff Adachi. Mr. Carmody said the document was among the supporting materials he sold to three local news programs that aired reports based on his work the day after Mr. Adachi's death. Mr. Carmody's reporting indicated that Mr. Adachi, who was 59 when he died in February, collapsed at the apartment of a woman who was not his wife. (In addition to the police report, Mr. Carmody obtained photographs of the apartment showing alcohol bottles and marijuana gummies.)

The Police Department said Tuesday that it viewed the manner in which Mr. Carmody obtained the report with suspicion. ""As the investigation developed,"" it said in its statement, ""Mr. Carmody was and continues to be viewed by investigators as a possible co-conspirator in this theft, rather than a passive recipient of the stolen document."" William Scott, San Francisco's police chief, told reporters that investigators believed that Mr. Carmody's contact with whoever had provided him with the police report ""went past just doing your job as a journalist."" The police obtained search warrants and raided Mr. Carmody's home this month, taking a sledgehammer to his door and seizing his equipment and archives, after he refused to divulge the identity of his source. At a hearing in San Francisco Superior Court on Tuesday, a judge set a schedule for the filing of briefs related to Mr. Carmody's motion to quash the search warrants, which would prevent the information the police obtained in the raid from being used against him or anyone else. The government's briefs are due by the end of the month. Mr. Carmody was allowed to retrieve his equipment and archives after the hearing. The police said the sharing of the report could have constituted several crimes, including ""the unlawful dissemination of official information,"" ""the willful obstruction of justice"" and ""receiving stolen property.""

The police have not taken a similarly aggressive stance toward Evan Sernoffsky, a crime reporter for The San Francisco Chronicle who relied on unnamed sources familiar with the same report for an article he wrote about Mr. Adachi's death.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Law enforcement authorities have not taken any apparent action against Mr. Sernoffsky, the newspaper that employs him or others in the same newsroom who have covered the story, according to Audrey Cooper, The Chronicle's editor in chief. The raid of Mr. Carmody's apartment took place in the wake of President Trump's frequent anti-press remarks and the federal government's prosecutions of the whistle-blowers Chelsea Manning and Reality Winner. The Police Department's statement on Tuesday sought to characterize Mr. Carmody as someone hoping to profit from ill-gotten official materials in his possession, rather than as a journalist. ""Investigators learned that Mr. Carmody was offering to sell the stolen report to various Bay Area news organizations,"" the statement said. ""Mr. Carmody's LinkedIn profile shows that he is a 'Freelance Videographer/Communications Manager, USO Bay Area' and that he was not employed by any of the news organizations who received the stolen report."" It is common for self-employed journalists to sell their work to news outlets that do not employ them. Those engaged in the kind of quick-hit journalism practiced by Mr. Carmody are commonly known as stringers. Investigators believe that whoever leaked the police records to Mr. Carmody is employed by the Police Department, the statement said. As a public defender, Mr. Adachi often challenged the department over allegations of abuse. The raid of Mr. Carmody's apartment prompted criticism of what free-press advocates have characterized as a trampling of First Amendment rights and a California shield law that protects journalists. Several dozen news organizations, including The New York Times Company and Dow Jones & Company, have filed a friend-of-the-court letter in support of Mr. Carmody. Mayor London Breed, after initially supporting the police, shifted her position over the weekend. ""The more we learn,"" she said of the raid, ""the less appropriate it looks to me."" George Gascon, the city's district attorney, has been less equivocal in his public criticism of the search.","After a judge ordered the return of the property police seized from Bryan Carmody during a raid, the department ratcheted up its attack.",efc3425a-b0c1-589e-8e4b-2340fbf5fbd8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/22/business/22SANFRANCISCO-01/merlin_155219451_e6630b3b-e463-48d0-bdb1-5637ae2f40c2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=cb589d9f61d7f6c331be0f898557d17015ea8f59629f8a7c3ede5e4a6f943a7f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"William Scott, San Francisco's police chief, said Bryan Carmody's actions in relation to a leaked document involving the death of the city's public defender ""went past just doing your job as a journalist.""",efc3425a-b0c1-589e-8e4b-2340fbf5fbd8,N24News/imgs/efc3425a-b0c1-589e-8e4b-2340fbf5fbd8.jpg,16
Television,"Barbara Windsor, Beloved British TV and Film Star, Dies at 83",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/18/arts/television/barbara-windsor-dead.html,"The actress Barbara Windsor at the British Academy Television Awards in London in 2009. She was a star of the series ""EastEnders"" on and off from 1994 to 2016.





LONDON -- Barbara Windsor, a star of the ""Carry On"" films and the long-running BBC soap opera ""EastEnders,"" whose dirty staccato laugh and ability to embody working-class life seared her into Britain's collective memory, died on Dec. 10 at a care home here. She was 83. Her death was announced in a statement by Scott Mitchell, her husband and only immediate survivor, who said the cause was Alzheimer's disease.

Ms. Windsor also had an impact in the United States, albeit briefly, when she appeared on Broadway in 1964 in ""Oh! What a Lovely War,"" Joan Littlewood's music-hall-style show that used irreverent songs from World War I to mock the absurdity of conflict. Some American theatergoers might have found Ms. Windsor's cockney accent hard to understand -- one of her first movies, ""Sparrows Can't Sing,"" played with subtitles at some screenings in New York -- but she was nominated for a Tony Award for best featured actress in a musical. In 1970, she told a BBC interviewer that she really wanted to make a film in Hollywood, preferably a comedy with Jack Lemmon. ""That'd be smashing, wouldn't it?"" she said. She didn't achieve that particular ambition, but she was soon immortalized in British movie theaters thanks to her roles in the farcical, innuendo-laden -- and hugely successful -- ""Carry On"" movies. Later, she became even more well known for her role as the matriarchal pub landlady Peggy Mitchell on ""EastEnders,"" a character she portrayed on and off from 1994 to 2016. She stopped once her Alzheimer's made it impossible to continue.

As a child in World War II, she was evacuated to Blackpool, a seaside resort in northern England. There, she revealed in her 2001 autobiography, ""All of Me: My Extraordinary Life,"" she first stayed with a family that tried to abuse her sexually, before moving in with a friend whose mother sent them both to dance lessons. The mother was so impressed by her talent that she wrote a letter to Ms. Windsor's parents begging them to let her take lessons in London. ""She's a proper show-off,"" the letter said, Ms. Windsor recalled in the 1970 BBC interview. Back in London, Ms. Windsor was spotted by a talent agent who tried to cast her in a pantomime, the peculiarly British form of theater popular at Christmas, but her school refused to give her time off. She eventually left to go to acting school, where the teachers repeatedly tried -- and failed -- to get her to lose her accent.

For all the promise Ms. Windsor showed, her break didn't come until 1960, when she traveled to East London to audition for a role with Ms. Littlewood's Theater Workshop, a company whose works often brought working-class life and humor onstage. The acclaim she got for her work there soon led to appearances on TV and then in film, where she became celebrated for her bawdy roles in the ""Carry On"" comedies. In those films, the camera often focused on the short (4-foot-11) but buxom Ms. Windsor's figure. She is probably best remembered for a scene in ""Carry On Camping"" (1969) in which her bikini top flies off during an outdoor aerobics class (during filming an assistant pulled the top off using a fishing line). That clip has been shown numerous times on British television ever since.

Although Ms. Windsor found success onscreen, her private life was troubled. She had liaisons with a series of famous men, including the soccer player George Best and the East London gangsters Reggie and Charlie Kray. In 1964 she married Ronnie Knight, another gangster, who in 1980 was tried for ordering a hit man to murder his brother's killer (he was acquitted), and in 1983 was involved in stealing six million pounds (more than 17 million pounds, or about $23 million, in today's money) from a security depot and fled to Spain. Her relationship with Mr. Knight caused her to have a nervous breakdown, she told the BBC in the 1990 interview. That marriage and a subsequent one ended in divorce. Her life got back on track on the 1990s after she was cast as Peggy Mitchell on ""EastEnders,"" the wildly popular kitchen-sink soap opera whose story lines often reflected social issues. She quickly became one of the show's stars, known for slapping her co-stars when the plot demanded a climactic moment and for story lines that could be far darker than anything one would find in a ""Carry On"" movie. (In 2010, one of her character's sons burned down the pub in the middle of a crack cocaine binge.) In the 1990s, her character had breast cancer twice and underwent a mastectomy, a plot that led hundreds of viewers to write to the BBC to express gratitude for how sensitively she handled the subject. In 2016, in her final appearance on the show, her character killed herself because her cancer had returned.","She went from bubbly sex symbol in the ""Carry On"" films to working-class hero on ""EastEnders.""

Theater,"Closed Theaters Are Nothing New. The Good News Is, They Reopen.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/theater/london-theater-shutdown.html,"The bombs that fell across London's theater land damaged some playhouses more than others. The Queen's Theater on Shaftesbury Avenue (now called the Sondheim) remained shut for almost 20 years.

""The artist's lot is not a happy one at present,"" opined a 1941 editorial in the trade newspaper The Stage, pointing to ""unemployment, uncertain duration of engagement, and food-rationing difficulties"" as problems that theater people faced.

Those concerns are being echoed today, as a profession accustomed to living from job to job wonders how it will survive a prolonged pause. The British government has announced financial measures and cash grants to help small enterprises, including theaters, and a plan is afoot to pay self-employed people 80 percent of their earnings, up to 2,500 pounds, or about $3,000, a month. But those gestures, however welcome, will not allay the anxiety felt by the theater professionals encountered on social media who were appearing on the West End a month ago and are now applying for jobs in grocery stores -- a growth industry in Britain, as it is elsewhere.

It's impossible not to feel deeply for those whose livelihoods hang in the balance. It's rare these days for an artist to be in the position of Shakespeare, who enjoyed not just the royal patronage of Queen Elizabeth I and then King James I, but also of various nobles who facilitated and supported his work.

And so, surveying a diary full of crossed-out events, I yearn for what is not to be: next week's deferred opening of Timothee Chalamet's London stage debut in ""4000 Miles"" at the Old Vic, or the enticing ""Jack Absolute Flies Again."" This joint authorial riff from a seasoned playwright, Richard Bean, and a fine actor, Oliver Chris, on Sheridan's 18th-century comic classic ""The Rivals"" was due any minute at the National Theater.

Instead, my email inbox is bulging with notices of new writing initiatives inspired by the pandemic, alongside online readings, cabarets, virtual opening nights, and all manner of attempts to keep the cultural conversation alive during lockdown. (The public is doing its bit, too: One family on lockdown came together to deliver a very sweet rendition of the song ""One Day More,"" from ""Les Miserables,"" which quickly became a social media sensation.)

The goal, of course, is to keep writers writing and actors busy until we can all reconvene inside those auditoriums that have weathered the financial storm. On the one hand, the musicals-heavy West End will probably reopen without the volume of tourists it needs to keep many of the tried-and-true hits going. The nonprofits, from the National Theater down, will have to live ever more by their wits, relying on individual largess to top-up government funding. Already, many of the state-subsidized theaters are asking patrons whose performances have been canceled not to take a refund, and to think of it as a donation.","London's playhouses have been shuttered before, by plagues and war for instance, but they have always returned as strong as ever.",5521c074-82cc-5d42-8806-48ac1d887184,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/09/arts/09london-theater1/09london-theater1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=591dd9162db7563306b094438c937f3870a36ccaa7997b6d3bfa0d215a281104&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A production of ""King Lear"" at Shakespeare's Globe in London in 2008.

He was joined by the rhythm section from ""Trickster"" -- Anthony Tidd on bass and Sean Rickman on drums -- as well as Matt Mitchell on piano. All four musicians have come through the tutelage of the alto saxophonist and rhythmic experimentalist Steve Coleman, and Mr. Okazaki's tunes offer their own inquiries into and around Mr. Coleman's strategies. Slippery cadences blend funk with ideas from around the globe; flashes of conspicuous historical memory meet a tenacious futurism. Mr. Okazaki's set featured five tunes from the album. He began many of them with halting, staccato phrases on the guitar's bottom three strings, engaging Mr. Tidd in a bubbling repartee before the entire band was eventually pulled into the tangled flow. Mr. Okazaki rarely plays chords; his linear style has a fleetness reminiscent of Pat Martino and a rough, chunky picking style not unlike that of Grant Green. But over the unflexed, tumbling grooves of his rhythm section, such as in the set-closing ""Caduceus,"" his playing felt like something utterly contemporary, free from the expectations of what it means to play a guitar in a group setting -- not just in jazz, but any kind.

The saxophonist Ravi Coltrane has spent much of his career standing apart from the heavy legacy of his father, John Coltrane, who died when he was not yet 2 years old. Of late, the younger Mr. Coltrane has turned much of his attention toward his mother, the pianist and harpist Alice Coltrane, whose influence is less ubiquitous in jazz. But at Jazz Standard on Wednesday, there was no way to avoid thinking about paternal inheritance. Performing with a trio, Mr. Coltrane welcomed a special guest, Tomoki Sanders, a fellow tenor saxophonist and the son of Pharoah Sanders, who performed with John Coltrane in his final years and carried the spiritual-jazz mantle after Coltrane's 1967 death. Clearly, the risk of a disappointing gimmick would seem to be running high. But Mr. Coltrane is allergic to glib gestures, and it quickly became clear that Tomoki Sanders was there for the right reasons. At 23, Mr. Sanders cannot even be called a new face on the New York scene yet: He spent his teenage years living in Tokyo and is currently finishing his degree at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. But you'll be hearing from him soon. There are few saxophonists in jazz today as silvery and deft as Ravi Coltrane, who blew a handful of melted-ore solos throughout the evening, bending in all sorts of directions without slurring the notes themselves. But Mr. Sanders kept up with him handsomely. He played some keen, beboppish solos of his own, always keeping track of the pocket and never losing his command.

Unsurprisingly, Mr. Coltrane had the snugger rapport with his rhythm section -- Dezron Douglas on bass and Allan Mednard on drums -- but Mr. Sanders was keyed in and constantly listening. On the opening of ""Fifth House,"" just seconds into the performance, he and Mr. Coltrane came together to play a drone, melding comfortably. When the tune neared its end, the two saxophonists threw out little, charmlike notes and dashes. Mr. Sanders was quick and light of touch, finding the spaces between Mr. Coltrane's tones. Ultimately the two horns became locked in an unlikely harmony, just one note apart, embracing the fertile space between them. Mr. Coltrane's trio plays at Jazz Standard through Sunday, without Mr. Sanders.

The bassist Omer Avital makes big-boned, ebullient, swinging music with a spine that's equal parts 1950s Blue Note records and timeless Middle Eastern modes. He manages to play small-group jazz in a way that's bracing and direct enough to sound fresh and engaging, but has no interest in self-conscious postmodernity. His combinations feel naturally unified, not like a synthesis. Just as important, he puts joy and abandon out front; his authorship is affirmed moment to moment over the course of a performance, rather than through the building of a conceptual identity. Mr. Avital's past albums (almost all of them winners) have had names like ""Think With Your Heart"" and ""The Ancient Art of Giving,"" and that spirit is contagious. Onstage at Bar Lunatico in Brooklyn, performing with a new quartet called Qantar, a smile tended to reign over his entire face as he pushed his band mates into a variety of propulsive patterns. He was born in Israel to parents of Moroccan and Yemeni descent, and his songwriting often balances desert languor with cosmopolitan urgency.

On ""Just Like the River Flows,"" he started with a dark bass solo, then moved into a sauntering, minor-key shimmy. A few songs later, on the dashing ""Know What I Mean,"" the tenor saxophonist Asaf Yuria took a swift, skittering solo; then the pianist Eden Ladin took over, cooling and remolding things by way of unexpected harmonic interjections, never letting up on the fast tempo. By the time Mr. Ladin crescendoed, he was moving on many levels at once, free of friction but in touch with a vast history. Omer Avital's new album, ""Qantar,"" will come out on April 15.

Ingrid Jensen is now one of jazz's most reputed trumpeters, but a quarter century ago she was a young musician just getting her bearings in the newly formed DIVA Jazz Orchestra. That group's leader, the drummer Sherrie Maricle, has kept it together over the years by holding on to some longtime members while welcoming a steady stream of young talents when those like Ms. Jensen move on to other things. As female instrumentalists have increasingly claimed space in jazz's male-centric spotlight, DIVA has served as a proving ground for some of the music's rising voices. Ms. Jensen is a testament to that. She has a distinctive, hazel-hued tone and a restless improviser's style, in contact with the influence of Freddie Hubbard but less inclined to clean landings. On Thursday, in the first set of DIVA's four-night run at Dizzy's, she joined the orchestra as a special guest. (This weekend's shows are a celebration of the group's 25th anniversary, and the release of its new album.)

There are few jazz orchestras with a tighter machinery or a more sweeping repertory of original music. The set began with ""East Coast Andy,"" a shuffling composition by the baritone saxophonist Leigh Pilzer, with a Count Basie bone structure and a Bob Brookmeyer musculature. That was followed by ""Middle Ground,"" a folklike lament by the tenor saxophonist and clarinetist Janelle Reichman, and a medley of tunes by Noriko Ueda, the bassist. The set closed with ""The Rhythm Changes,"" a blues extension written by Ms. Maricle, with the trombones, trumpets and saxophones unified in a full-throated declaration. The DIVA Jazz Orchestra plays at Dizzy's through Sunday. Jonathan Finlayson stood onstage at the Stone's new home in a theater at the New School, almost ready to start his set. His body was angled halfway toward his band mates, his trumpet held at his side. He muttered a few words to his rhythm section, the bassist John Hebert and the drummer Craig Weinrib, and hesitated. A little voice shot up from the back row: ""I'm waiting!"" It was Mr. Hebert's toddler son, who in all fairness had been exercising extreme patience for about 30 whole seconds. Mr. Finlayson smiled, put the horn to his lips, and got going with the set's first song, ""Tap Tap."" But that didn't solve the problem entirely. Mr. Finlayson's music is all about waiting: for pieces to fit into place, for a melody to gain lift, for the ship to dock. That's by design, and it creates a constant feed of generative precarity. Mr. Finlayson was introducing a new sextet, which headed into the studio soon after this show to record an album. On ""Tap Tap,"" he and the pianist Matt Mitchell gave chase to the chord changes, baiting them and tackling them, while the tenor saxophonist Brian Settles played fewer notes, seeming to live inside the harmonies as they moved. Steve Lehman, on alto saxophone, was a picture of total command -- rhythmically goading the rest of the band and pulling the drummer Craig Weinrib into a bodily exchange. The combination of openness and complexity in this music spells a certain kind of possibility: Mr. Mitchell took a solo that was almost entirely eighth notes, with nearly no rests, and still seemed to create rhythmic suspense at every turn. Jonathan Finlayson's most recent album, ""Moving Still,"" was a New York Times best album of 2016.","Great performances, including the sons of John Coltrane and Pharoah Sanders and a night with the DIVA Jazz Orchestra, on stages across New York.",10b1262a-cf14-55ab-90ea-8bc10b9fe8af,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/31/arts/31bestmarchjazz-okazaki/31bestmarchjazz-okazaki-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=0a8291a61fda155945579a805ead680bbc3630390785ff590ec2472a533fcaaf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Miles Okazaki performed a handful of songs from his standout 2017 album ""Trickster"" at the Jazz Gallery, where the music had first taken shape.",10b1262a-cf14-55ab-90ea-8bc10b9fe8af,N24News/imgs/10b1262a-cf14-55ab-90ea-8bc10b9fe8af.jpg,12
Travel,Google Translate Updates Could Benefit Travelers,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/travel/google-translate-will-offer-chinese.html,"Need a translation app for your vacation but don't want to get slammed with a big data bill?

New updates to Google Translate, including the addition of another major language and a pop-up translation feature, can help.

Art & Design,18 Art Exhibitions to View in NYC This Weekend,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/arts/design/art-and-museums-in-nyc-this-week.html,"Our guide to new art shows -- and some that will be closing soon. 'TARSILA DO AMARAL: INVENTING MODERN ART IN BRAZIL' at the Museum of Modern Art (through June 3). The subtitle is no overstatement: In the early 1920s, first in Paris and then back home in Sao Paulo, Brazil, this painter really did lay the groundwork for the coming of modernism in Latin America's most populous nation. Tired of the European pretenders in Brazil's art academies, Tarsila (who was always called by her first name) began to intermingle Western, African and indigenous motifs into flowing, biomorphic paintings, and to theorize a new national culture fueled by the principle of antropofagia, or ""cannibalism."" Along with spare, assured drawings of Rio and the Brazilian countryside, this belated but very welcome show assembles Tarsila's three most important paintings, including the classic ""Abaporu"" (1928): a semi-human nude with a spindly nose and a comically swollen foot. (Jason Farago)

212-708-9400, moma.org 'THE BEAUTIFUL BRAIN: THE DRAWINGS OF SANTIAGO RAMON Y CAJAL' at Grey Art Gallery (through March 31). The first United States museum exhibition devoted to the scientific illustrations of this Spanish giant of neuroscience is among the year's best so far. Its 80 freehand renderings of different brain cells, as viewed through a microscope, helped prove that they are unconnected, communicating across tiny gaps called synaptic clefts, which earned Cajal a Nobel Prize in 1906. His exquisite images, still used in textbooks, ignite synaptic charges throughout 20th-century art, from Surrealism onward. (Roberta Smith)

212-998-6780, greyartgallery.nyu.edu 'BIRDS OF A FEATHER: JOSEPH CORNELL'S HOMAGE TO JUAN GRIS' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through April 15). This small, hyper-specialized, stunning exhibition brings together a grand total of only 13 works -- a dozen shadow boxes by Joseph Cornell, the Queens-based assemblage artist, and the Cubist masterwork that he cited as their direct inspiration, Gris's ""Man at the Cafe"" (1914). It might seem like a surprising obsession for Cornell, who was not a painter nor a Frenchman. He and Gris never met. But Cornell was deeply moved by Gris, the overlooked, tag-along third wheel in the Cubist movement that also included Picasso and Braque, and the show succeeds in tracking the fluttery ways of artistic inspiration. (Deborah Solomon)

212-535-7710, metmuseum.org 'DIAMOND MOUNTAINS: TRAVEL AND NOSTALGIA IN KOREAN ART' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through May 20). Mount Kumgang, or the ""Diamond Mountain,"" lies about 90 miles from Pyeongchang's Olympic Stadium, but it's a world away: The august, multipeaked range lies in North Korea and has been impossible to visit for most of the past seven decades. This melancholy beauty of a show, featuring stunning loans from the National Museum of Korea and other institutions in Seoul, South Korea, assembles three centuries' worth of paintings of the Diamond Mountain range, and explores how landscapes intermingle nostalgia, nationalism, legend and regret. The unmissable prizes here are the painstaking paintings of Jeong Seon, the 18th-century artist who is perhaps the greatest of all Korean painters. And later impressions of the mountains, including a blotchy vision from the Paris-based modernist Lee Ungno, give a deeper historical weight to very live geopolitics. (Farago)

212-535-7710, metmuseum.org

'THE FACE OF DYNASTY: ROYAL CRESTS FROM WESTERN CAMEROON' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Sept. 3). In the African wing, a show of just four commanding wooden crowns constitutes a blockbuster in its own right. These massive wooden crests -- in the form of stylized human faces with vast vertical brows -- served as markers of royal power among the Bamileke peoples of the Cameroonian grasslands, and the Met's recent acquisition of an 18th-century specimen is joined here by three later examples, each featuring sharply protruding cheeks, broadly smiling mouths and brows incised with involute geometric patterns. Ritual objects like these were decisive for the development of Western modernist painting, and a Cameroonian crest was even shown at MoMA in the 1930s, as a ""sculpture"" divorced from ethnography. But these crests had legal and diplomatic significance as well as aesthetic appeal, and their anonymous African creators had a political understanding of art not so far from our own. (Farago)

212-535-7710, metmuseum.org 'PETER HUJAR: SPEED OF LIFE' at the Morgan Library and Museum (through May 20). It's hard to say which is more surprising: that Peter Hujar's photographs of underground life in New York in the 1970s and '80s have found their way to the Morgan Library and Museum, or that the classically minded institution has become unbuttoned enough to exhibit them in this heartbreaker of a show. Hujar (1934-87) lived most of his professional life in the East Village and, through studio portraits and cityscapes, captured a downtown that has since been all but erased by time, gentrification and AIDS. Although he was little known by the mainstream art world in his lifetime, this show, startlingly tender, reveals him to be one of the major American photographers of the late 20th century. (Holland Cotter) 

212-685-0008, themorgan.org 'THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION' at the Museum of the Moving Image. The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America's great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program ""Sam and Friends"" before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was crafted from his mother's old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through ""Sesame Street"" and ""The Muppet Show,"" though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and story boards and rediscover some old friends. (Farago)

718-784-0077, movingimage.us 'MILLENNIUM: LOWER MANHATTAN IN THE 1990S' at the Skyscraper Museum (through April). This plucky Battery Park institution transports us back to the years of Rudy Giuliani, Lauryn Hill and 128-kilobit modems to reveal the enduring urban legacy of a decade bookended by recession and terror. In the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, landlords in the financial district rezoned their old skyscrapers for residential occupancy, and more than 20 towers were declared landmarks, including the ornate Standard Oil building at 26 Broadway and the home of Delmonico's at 56 Beaver Street. Battery Park City flowered; yuppies priced out of TriBeCa came down to Wall Street; a new Guggenheim, designed by a fresh-from-Bilbao Frank Gehry, nearly arose by South Street Seaport. From this distance, the 1990s can seem almost like a golden age, not least given that, more than 16 years after Sept. 11, construction at the underwhelming new World Trade Center is still not finished.

'ALBERTO SAVINIO' at the Center for Italian Modern Art (through June 23). The paintings of this Italian polymath have long been overshadowed by the brilliant work of his older brother, Giorgio de Chirico. This show of more than 20 canvases from the late 1920s to the mid-1930s may not change that, but the mix of landscapes with bright patterns and several eerie portraits based on family photographs are surprisingly of the moment. (Smith)

646-370-3596, italianmodernart.org 'SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION' at the Jewish Museum. After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art, by Jews and gentiles alike -- Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilletantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago)

212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org 'STEPHEN SHORE' at the Museum of Modern Art (through May 28). Not staged, not lit, not cropped, not retouched, the color photographs of this American master are feats of dispassionate representation. This must-see retrospective -- curated with real wit by Quentin Bajac, MoMA's photo chief -- opens with Mr. Shore's teenage snaps at Andy Warhol's Factory. Then it turns to the road-trip imagery of ""American Surfaces"" and the steely precision of ""Uncommon Places"" -- landmarks in photographic history that scandalized an establishment convinced the camera could find beauty solely in black-and-white. Mr. Shore is revealed not only as a peripatetic explorer but also a restless experimenter with new photographic technologies, from stereoscopic slide shows to print-on-demand books. The only flaw is his recent embrace of Instagram, allowing museumgoers to lazily flick through images on MoMA's smudged iPads. New technologies are great, but not at the expense of concentration. (Farago)

212-708-9400, moma.org '2018 TRIENNIAL: SONGS FOR SABOTAGE' at the New Museum (through May 27). This Bowery museum's fourth triennial exhibition, ""Songs for Sabotage,"" is the smallest, tightest edition of the show so far. Immaculately installed, it's also the best looking. There's a lot of good work, which is global in scope and not by a list of prevetted up-and-comers. (Zhenya Machneva, Dalton Paula and Daniela Ortiz are artists to look for.) Less admirably, it's a safe and unchallenging show. In a politically demanding time, it acts as if ambiguity and discretion were automatically virtues. In an era when the market rules, it puts its money on the kind of art -- easily tradable, displayable, palette-tickling objects -- that art fairs suck up. (Cotter)

212-219-1222, newmuseum.org 'THE VIETNAM WAR: 1945-1975' at the New-York Historical Society (through April 22). In contrast to the PBS series ""The Vietnam War,"" this exhibition delivers historical data, a lot of it, quick and dirty, through labels, film and audio clips and objects, some of which fall under a broad definition of art. Along with paintings by contemporary Vietnamese artists, there's graffiti-style drawings on combat helmets and Zippo lighters, and period design in album covers and protest posters. Words and images work together in murals labeled ""Home Front"" and ""War Front"" that put you in the middle of the war's primary issues and events. (Cotter)

212-873-3400, nyhistory.org

'TANIA BRUGUERA: UNTITLED (HAVANA, 2000)' at the Museum of Modern Art (through March 11). Nearly 18 years have passed since the artist and activist Tania Bruguera first mounted -- or attempted to mount -- ""Untitled (Havana, 2000)"" at the Seventh Havana Biennial. Critical of the post-revolutionary politics of Cuba, it was shut down by censors within hours. Now ""Untitled (Havana, 2000)"" is recreated here. In groups of four, you enter a dark space where you walk on sugar cane. As your eyes adjust, you see four naked men along the wall and video propaganda images of Fidel Castro. Borrowing aesthetic motifs from earlier art, like medieval and Renaissance painting, Ms. Bruguera's tableau vivant asks you to ""stop looking and start thinking"" about politics, history and violence. (Martha Schwendener) 

212-708-9400, moma.org 'CAROLEE SCHNEEMANN: KINETIC PAINTING' at MoMA PS1 (through March 11). Some say that #MeToo has gone too far. What modern misogynist will be yanked from museums next? Gauguin? Picasso? I say, sure, why not? Set them aside, give them a rest and make room for what we never see, which means art by almost any woman you can name. Carolee Schneemann is one I'd move right into the cleared-out spotlight, not just because she has star quality, which she does, or because she has majorly shaped art history, which she has. I'd put her there because, in a career of some 60 years, she's been one of the most generous artists around -- generous with her presence, her thinking, her formal and political risk taking, and her embrace of embracing itself. You'll find evidence of all of this in her first comprehensive retrospective. (Cotter)

718-784-2084, momaps1.org 'THE SCULPTURE OF GONZALO FONSECA' at the Noguchi Museum (through March 11). The Uruguayan-American sculptor Gonzalo Fonseca (1922-97) pioneered an architecturally inflected, whimsically literary style of relentless ambiguity. Whether covering large pieces of Italian travertine with incised circles and tiny pyramids, fixing a small red sail to a flat chunk of limestone or titling a tabletop-size pillar of dark gray stone ""Self-Portrait,"" Fonseca made his work live by putting it almost entirely in the power of the viewer's imagination. This modest but jampacked mini retrospective -- aptly sited in the museum built by his friend and fellow stone carver Isamu Noguchi -- is worth taking in slowly. (Will Heinrich)

718-204-7708, noguchi.org 'CATHY WILKES' at MoMA PS1 (through March 11). A tea-ringed saucer, a discolored hatbox, an unfixed sink or a case of vegetable peelers -- from these humble materials, the Irish-born artist conjures wrenchingly moving tableaus of family, loss and memory. Ms. Wilkes is one of the leading lights of the white-hot Glasgow contemporary art scene, and her unprepossessing sculpture, installations and paintings are shown to advantage here. Works are shown without barriers and often sit directly on the floor, emphasizing their fragility and care. (PS1 limits entry to the galleries to a few dozen at a time.) This show is an invitation to slow down, to look closely, to think and to feel at once. (Farago)

Fashion & Style,Ben Whishaw Makes Himself at Home in New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/04/fashion/ben-whishaw-crucible.html,"Left, Ben Whishaw in a Prada coat, $3,300, and chambray shirt, $650, at select Prada boutiques; L.L. Bean cotton mock turtleneck, $29.99, at llbean.com; Raf Simons wool pants, $487, at rafsimons.com; and Church's leather derbies, $820, at church-footwear.com. Right, in clothes from Comme des Garcons Homme Plus: a wool jacket ($1,250), a cotton vest ($380) and a cotton shirt ($310). Available at the Comme des Garcons store in Manhattan (520 West 22nd Street, 212-604-9200).

In the last week of January, Ben Whishaw, the waifish and intense star of ""London Spy"" and the 2008 remake of ""Brideshead Revisited,"" arrived in New York from London for a six-month stay. Installed in the West Village, for weeks Mr. Whishaw has walked across Manhattan to a work space in the East Village, and for five hours a day rehearsed for his Broadway debut. Mr. Whishaw, 35, is here for the Broadway revival of ""The Crucible,"" now in previews. He stars opposite the Oscar nominees Saoirse Ronan and Sophie Okonedo as John Proctor, the upright but errant linchpin of the play, who faces down, rather than buckles under, the accusations of witchcraft that roiled Salem, Mass., in 1692. Despite being steeped in Arthur Miller's grim, hysterical Puritan world, Mr. Whishaw recently tumbled into an East Village seafood restaurant merry and full of praise for New York. ""I love it here,"" he said, settling into a corner table and ordering a glass of Chianti. ""It's a cliche, but it is true, and it's quite stark when you come from somewhere else: It's the positivity and optimism of this place. You won't notice it, because you're around it all the time, but it's very 'up,' compared to England.""

He may naturally incline toward the English national character, he admitted with a giggle, but New York agrees with him. Here he, too, is up. Despite a career that has taken him to tiny theaters and megabudget ""Bond"" films alike, he remains something of a cipher, a chameleon able to walk the streets of New York unrecognized and unbothered. ""He's not an actor who pushes himself into the front,"" said Ivo van Hove, the director of ""The Crucible."" ""Actually, the opposite is true. I have to push him to the front.""

""They were always incredibly supportive of me wanting to do acting,"" he said, ""and never put it in my head that there has to be a more sensible option to fall back on."" And so there never was. So far, there has been no need of one. Mr. Whishaw found success early, playing ""Hamlet"" in Trevor Nunn's 2004 production just after graduating from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, and has worked continually ever since. He is one of the most celebrated stage actors of his generation and has turned up in a wide range of film and TV roles. He is the latest Q in the 007 films, a precocious, baby-genius variation on the usual theme; he is ""Richard II"" in a televised adaptation of Shakespeare's history plays, a performance that won him a British Academy of Film and Television Arts award in 2013; he is, whether you realize it or not, the voice of Paddington Bear. (""Endearing,"" The New Yorker said.) His calling card is a soulful fragility, all faunlike bearing and saucer eyes, with a teenager's unruly mop mane. It is no accident that fashion has made him a favorite, and in 2013, he appeared in an ad campaign for Prada. Many of his roles play up this quality: the doomed, lovelorn John Keats of Jane Campion's biopic ""Bright Star""; the preening, brittle Sebastian Flyte of ""Brideshead Revisited""; and, more recently, the bereaved malcontent searching for answers after his lover's murder in the critically lauded BBC mini-series ""London Spy."" The bushy beard that his part in ""The Crucible"" requires does little to dispel the tender aura he projects. John Proctor is typically played as a virtuous brute, a brawny man's man of 17th century New England. (In the 2002 revival, the role went to the hulking Liam Neeson.)

""I have a lot of fear,"" Mr. Whishaw said. ""All the time. But it's important somehow to have fear and then to overcome it. I feel a bit like I'm always on an edge, where the fear might completely overwhelm me and I might not be able to do it. That's not happened yet."" As an actor, Mr. Whishaw rejects the idea of type altogether, which may in part account for the range of his resume. He has a slippery way of inhabiting heroes and antiheroes alike, of seducing women and men onscreen and onstage with equal ease.

He is, in fact, one of the few openly gay actors to frequently play straight romance. He officially came out in 2013, to little controversy or fanfare, and confirmed his relationship with his partner, Mark Bradshaw, an Australian composer. ""I've never been anything other than myself,"" Mr. Whishaw said, though earlier in his career he was vague about his sexuality and deflected questions about it, leading to occasional uncertainty in the press. While promoting a play, ""The Pride,"" in which he and Hugh Dancy played lovers, Mr. Whishaw gave interviews to New York Magazine and to Out -- one of which assumed that he was straight, the other, gay. (The Village Voice gleefully pointed out the inconsistency.) ""We must be watching gay actors play straight people all the time,"" he said, ""but we just don't know about it, mustn't we? It's not even an issue. It doesn't matter."" He is equally uninterested in dissecting his acting approach or his methods. ""When I was doing 'London Spy,' Jim Broadbent, who I adore, said, 'You must never talk about acting,'"" Mr. Whishaw said. And on the whole, he does not. He called himself an ""instinctive"" actor. But he is staunch in his conviction that his work is not an expression of, nor is it limited to, his own experience.

""If I could only act the things I've experienced, then I'd be a very limited actor,"" he said. ""It's a preposterous idea that that's all that an actor can do. I'm not really like any of the characters that I've played. I don't feel like they're me. Anything's possible. You can understand anybody, really, or try to."" At the moment, he is working to understand John Proctor, in all his tortured uncertainties, as well as America, his temporary home, in all of its own. ""It's really hard for me -- for us,"" he said. (Given the play's long run, Mr. Bradshaw also moved with him to the West Village.) ""It has its own set of ideas about stuff."" He was full of questions about Donald J. Trump, the electoral system and America's fraught relationship to gun ownership. (""The Crucible,"" period piece though it is, has, in its evil-in-our-midst persecutions, plenty of application to the American present. ""We see it every day around us,"" Mr. van Hove said.)

Back at the seafood restaurant in the declining light of the afternoon -- he had just finished with rehearsal, which Mr. van Hove holds religiously from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., no later -- Mr. Whishaw finished off his Chianti, then his companion's, and waxed thoughtful about his life as an actor. ""I'd probably do it if I had to go and do it above a pub,"" he said. He probably will not have to. ""I'm a bit in awe of how brilliant he is, I really am,"" said Ms. Ronan, his co-star, who plays Abigail Williams, John Proctor's former mistress and the ringleader of the accusers. ""That doesn't happen to me very often.""","Even though steeped in the grim, hysterical Puritan world of ""The Crucible,"" the British actor is merry and full of praise for his new temporary home.",fd94f618-6d78-50d5-afd7-c59be0ef8746,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/06/fashion/06WISHAW-COMBO2/06WISHAW-COMBO2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=9b72b7f30aed9965fc270ec4a68579301a1a05f8d83a603ab81485cf2d2dbb14&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Left, Ben Whishaw in a Prada coat, $3,300, and chambray shirt, $650, at select Prada boutiques; L.L.

Health,Vaping Bad: Were 2 Wisconsin Brothers the Walter Whites of THC Oils?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/15/health/vaping-thc-wisconsin.html,"BRISTOL, Wis. -- The drug bust shattered the early-morning stillness of this manicured subdivision in southeastern Wisconsin. The police pulled up outside a white-shuttered brick condo, jolting neighbors out of their beds with the thud of heavy banging on a door. What they found inside was not crystal meth or cocaine or fentanyl but slim boxes of vaping cartridges labeled with flavors like strawberry and peaches and cream . An additional 98,000 cartridges lay empty. Fifty-seven Mason jars nearby contained a substance that resembled dark honey: THC-laced liquid used for vaping, a practice that is now at the heart of a major public health scare sweeping the country. Vaping devices, which have soared in popularity as a way to consume nicotine and THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, have been linked in the last several months to nearly 400 illnesses and six deaths. State and federal health investigators have not yet determined a cause, but authorities are focusing on whether noxious chemicals have found their way into vaping supplies, perhaps from a flourishing nationwide black market of vaping products fueled by online sales and lax regulation. The bust this month in Wisconsin, where THC is illegal, offers an intimate look at the shadowy operations serving large numbers of teenagers and adults around the country who are using black-market vaping products, sometimes unknowingly because it is difficult to tell them apart from legitimate ones.

""When we walked in there, we were like, 'Oh boy,'"" said Capt. Dan Baumann of the Waukesha Police Department. ""This is what we were looking for, but we did not know it was this big."" Key players in the operation, authorities said, were brothers barely into their 20s, Jacob and Tyler Huffhines, who lived in a small town nearby . Both are now in custody at the Kenosha County Jail. More arrests and charges in the case are likely to follow, according to the police. Tyler, 20, is being held on charges of the manufacture, distribution or delivery of marijuana; Jacob, 23, is being held on charges of cocaine possession and of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Authorities said that Jacob was being investigated for his involvement in the drug operation.

""I'd meet people at Starbucks, a cross street, in front of an apartment, wherever they tell you,"" said a 17-year-old who was one of the people hospitalized for the vaping-related lung illness in New York state. He asked that his name not be used to guard his reputation and privacy. ""It never comes up where they source it,"" he said. ""You don't ask."" Investigators have not determined whether there is a connection between the Wisconsin operation and any of the cases of severe lung diseases linked to vaping. But public health officials across the country, including Mitch Zeller, director of the Center for Tobacco Products for the Food and Drug Administration, say that street-made vaping products should be avoided by all consumers and pose the greatest health risk. Vaping works by heating liquid and turning it into vapor to be inhaled. The original intent was to give smokers a way to satisfy their nicotine cravings without inhaling the carcinogens that come with burning tobacco. But vaping devices and cartridges can be used to heat many substances, including cannabis-based oils, and some of the solvents used to dissolve them can present their own health problems. On Wednesday the Trump administration said it planned to ban most flavored e-cigarettes and nicotine pods -- including mint and menthol, in an effort to reduce the allure of vaping for teenagers. But the move may expand underground demand for flavored pods. And it does nothing to address the robust trade in illicit cannabis vaping products. The Wisconsin operation is wholly characteristic of a ""very advanced and mature illicit market for THC vape carts,"" said David Downs, an expert in the marijuana trade and the California bureau chief for Leafly, a website that offers news, information and reviews of cannabis products. (""Carts"" is the common shorthand for cartridges.)

""These types of operations are integral to the distribution of contaminated THC-based vape carts in the United States,"" Mr. Downs said. They are known as ""pen factories,"" playing a crucial middleman role: The operations buy empty vape cartridges and counterfeit packaging from Chinese factories, then fill them with THC liquid that they purchase from the United States market. Empty cartridges and packaging are also available on eBay, Alibaba and other e-commerce sites. The filled cartridges are not by definition a health risk. However, Mr. Downs, along with executives from legal THC companies and health officials, say that the illicit operations are using a tactic common to other illegal drug operations: cutting their product with other substances, including some that can be dangerous. The motive is profit; an operation makes more money by using less of the core ingredient, THC -- which is expensive -- and diluting it with oils that cost considerably less. Public health authorities said some cutting agents might be the cause of the lung illnesses and had homed in on a particular one, vitamin E acetate, an oil that could cause breathing problems and lung inflammation if it does not heat up fully during the vaping aerosolization process. Medium-grade THC can cost $4,000 a kilo and higher-grade THC costs double that, but additives may cost pennies on the dollar, said Chip Paul, a longtime vaping entrepreneur in Oklahoma who led the state's drive to legalize medical marijuana there. ""That's what they're doing, they're cutting this oil,"" he said of illegal operations. ""If I can cut it in half,"" he described the thinking, ""I can double my money.""

The black market products come packaged looking as the THC vaping products that are legal in some states do. Sometimes the packages are direct counterfeits of mass-market brands sold in places like California or Colorado, where THC is legal, and others just look the part. ""Someone would not recognize that this is not a legitimate product,"" said Dr. Howard Zucker, commissioner of the New York State Department of Health, adding that this is a tremendous risk. ""The counterfeit handbag you buy on the corner is not going to kill you but the counterfeit vaping device you buy has a chance to kill you,"" he said. In Wisconsin, the neatly packaged vaping devices had logos such as Dabwoods, Chronic Sour Patch and Dank King Louie. The police say the Huffhines operation produced close to 3,000 cartridges a day . Cartridges sell for around $35 to $40.

Wisconsin police say they were stunned by the scope and ambition of the Huffhines operation, and only beginning to understand how far it might have reached. It was a teenager in nearby Waukesha whose actions eventually led the police to the operation in Bristol, a town just miles from the Illinois border. That teenager's parents discovered that he was vaping and brought him to the police station in Waukesha. He then told the police where he got his vaping supplies; the authorities traced the sellers step by step, and several degrees of separation later, they were led to the Huffhines brothers.

The condo in Bristol, rented under a false name, was believed to be their base of operations. But on an afternoon this past week, it appeared deserted, with the blinds inside closed tightly and a dent on the front door. Until recently, the condo hummed with quiet activity that attracted only glancing notice from neighbors. The operation employed at least 10 people, the police said, who were paid $20 an hour to use syringes to fill cartridges with oil. The Huffhineses kept meticulous records, using timecards to note when employees worked. The cartridges were sold in packs of 100, through channels that authorities, who also seized 18 pounds of marijuana and three money-counting machines, said they did not yet fully understand. It might have been the perfect place for a drug operation, said one neighbor, who described the subdivision as a mix of busy professionals and families who do not socialize much.

Students leaving school Thursday afternoon described a system of easy access to vaping devices that contain nicotine or THC, despite strict penalties from administrators if they are caught. Students frequently vape in the bathrooms, they said, and obtaining vaping devices is as simple as asking someone for a contact. News about deaths and injuries from vaping has been spreading throughout school, a 16-year-old said. ""People are scared of getting caught,"" he added. ""Now they're scared of getting sick, too.""","As the authorities work to understand the spate of vaping-related lung illnesses, a small-town drug bust offers a closer look at the vast black market for vaping supplies.",d33c5f2f-edc2-5351-9b5e-ef9e13c1dfc5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/14/science/14VAPING-diptych/14VAPING-diptych-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=9696f6e98f3bee780b47176cc24bfdfcfc12addba7f3b42c4b81054bafc2db0b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Tyler Huffhines, left, and Jacob Huffhines.",d33c5f2f-edc2-5351-9b5e-ef9e13c1dfc5,N24News/imgs/d33c5f2f-edc2-5351-9b5e-ef9e13c1dfc5.jpg,1
Sports,Patriots Owner Robert Kraft Offered a Deal That Would Drop Charges,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/sports/robert-kraft-charges.html,"Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, has been offered a deal that includes paying a fine and doing community service in return for admitting that if his soliciting prostitution case were to go to trial, the prosecutors would win.

The prosecutors in Palm Beach County, Fla., offered the deal to Mr. Kraft and 24 other men who last month were arrested on misdemeanor charges of buying sex at the Orchids of Asia day spa in Jupiter, Fla.

The police and prosecutors say the massage parlor is the focus of a wider investigation into human sex trafficking in several counties in Florida. Mr. Kraft -- who faces two misdemeanor counts -- and the other 24 men have been charged only with soliciting prostitution; they have not been charged with any crimes in connection to sex trafficking.

News of the plea offer was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

The investigation into sex trafficking is still continuing, said Mike Edmondson, a spokesman for the state attorney's office in Palm Beach County.",The offer — sent to 25 men involved in the solicitation of prostitution case — requires admitting that Florida prosecutors would win if their cases went to trial.,48c2ae98-e8cd-507b-9aff-86eb19577dbb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/19/sports/19kraft-1/19kraft-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=503729bc9da7419ea637ce84040aeade1f0fede436a5052f22bee849e2eec5de&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Robert K.

Dance,"Tapping Feet, Uninhibited, Step Up and Pay Tribute to a Voice of Jazz",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/arts/michela-marino-lerman-and-others-tap-into-betty-carter.html,"Near midnight on Tuesday at Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, three women tap-danced as the floor beneath them shifted. The dancing surface was three small wooden platforms. These were laid contiguously, but the force of footwork kept spreading them apart. The more challenging variable, though, was musical. For this was a tribute to the great and iconoclastic jazz singer Betty Carter, whose original songs and far-from-standard arrangements of standards rarely sat long in any groove or speed.

The tribute, which continues through Saturday, was organized by one of the dancers, Michela Marino Lerman. In recent years, Ms. Lerman has shown admirable tenacity in getting herself booked into jazz clubs, a natural home for her art that bookers too rarely recognize as such. Since 2009, she has run a weekly tap jam session at Smalls jazz club in the West Village. In March, she presented a weeklong tribute to Horace Silver at Dizzy's; last month, she was back here as part of the Generations in Jazz Festival. The repeated invitations are a good sign.

This week, she is joined by a nimble jazz trio (Takeshi Ohbayashi on piano, Alex Claffy on bass and Kyle Poole on drums), the captivating vocalist Charanee Wade and the sister hoofers Alexandria Bradley (also known as Brinae Ali) and Frances Bradley. The dancers open and close the show with some pithy unison choreography but otherwise trade off improvising with one another and the band.

Though unfocused in parts, the opening-night set caught the right spirit, denying any conflict, as Carter did, between adventurous jazz and a rollicking party. The Bradley sisters sassed it up, spicing their adept and powerful tapping with lots of vernacular sauce. Of the two, Frances is the more ladylike, a little stiff up top with a melting smile. Alexandria is wilder, almost punk in attitude, and she handled the tricky changes of ""Sounds (Movin' On)"" as she did the sliding boards: with haphazard boldness.","Michela Marino Lerman, with two other dancers, a vocalist and a jazz trio, paid homage to Betty Carter.",29e59588-23b0-5b22-84b1-7157fe4556b3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/09/arts/dance/09lerman-sub/09lerman-sub-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=156&w=600&s=94614187c467ad7469f2c57a486c7f997dd19b4bde2cc69511bc6685994884e9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"From left, Frances Bradley, Alexandria Bradley and Michela Marino Lerman help celebrate the singer Betty Carter at Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola at Jazz at Lincoln Center.",29e59588-23b0-5b22-84b1-7157fe4556b3,N24News/imgs/29e59588-23b0-5b22-84b1-7157fe4556b3.jpg,6
Fashion & Style,The Future of Male Beauty at the Men's Wear Shows in Paris,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/fashion/mens-style/paris-menswear-male-beauty-givenchy-dries-van-noten.html,"PARIS -- If the state of masculinity was in play during this men's wear cycle, as designers like Pierpaolo Piccioli of Valentino asserted in a backstage interview, you could have fooled this viewer. As for the human condition, that's another story. In a fraught political climate, anxieties about artificial intelligence and other technologies, including medical, have a way of insinuating themselves even into fashion. The so-called trans moment, for instance, has, to a largely unacknowledged extent, been quietly impelled by anatomical alterations long idealized in fiction but only recently attainable in fact. For most of human history, our tinkering with the body has been confined to its surfaces; now technology enables us to regulate hearts and brains, replicate and even create organs, or, potentially, to render other body parts obsolete. Isn't that part of what's being symbolized when designers show shirts with sleeves so long -- as Rick Owens and many others have been doing lately -- the wearer might as well have no hands?

You won't often find designers like Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garcons Homme Plus and Riccardo Tisci of Givenchy appearing in the same sentence, let alone using the sophisticated aesthetic arena of a fashion show to express a similar tenderness for the male form. Mr. Tisci expressed this, first of all, by casting his show with men of varied ethnicities and with the strong and occasionally unconventional features that underscore how generally insipid beauty conventions can be.

There were bright red blanket plaids; ornately toggle-fastened stadium coats; ruched necklines right out of ""Little House on the Prairie""; and sweaters patterned with the faces of mythical creatures said to have been inspired by Haida totem poles, though they looked closer to the lolling-tongued Tibetan demons Alessandro Michele plastered all over his Gucci collection last June. The Givenchy show was held concurrently with the United States presidential inauguration and took place in the rotunda of the Bibliotheque Nationale, at more than five centuries one of the world's oldest libraries and a cornerstone of French civilization. Front-row types spent much of the show with eyes flicking from runway to smartphones playing live video feeds from the Capitol, inevitably reflecting on the new world order. Mr. Tisci ended the show, as he has others recently, with 10 women's dresses that are a designer version of a movie trailer. Although not the most obviously logical thing to do at a show of ready-to-wear for men, the gesture was consistent with the second of Hogarth's principles of beauty, the one that says the eye requires variety.

Rei Kawakubo called her Comme des Garcons Homme Plus show ""Boyhood"" and none-too-subtly underscored the theme by affixing rubber toy molds of a car, a dinosaur and a steam engine to the toe caps of shoes and various surfaces of her clothes. Some saw in the show a critique of masculinity and the implication that inside all men are little boys. Yet if you stripped away the gimmickry (including the wigs in Necco wafer colors), what you were left with was Ms. Kawakubo's oddly consistent romance with the male body, which over the years she has cocooned and embellished, draped and torqued, and generally sought to beautify.

Here it was done by dressing her young models in soft, flowing skirt-shorts reminiscent of Japanese courtly garments and billowing, ankle-length trousers worn under blousy suit jackets that, by this particular designer's standards, were close to conventional. Though not a proposition many men are likely to embrace, the bared midriffs featured throughout the show were Ms. Kawakubo's nod to an often overlooked erogenous zone. Mr. Piccioli at Valentino was literal about his quest for beauty. Using scraps of text -- he called them poems -- commissioned from Jamie Reid, the graphic designer responsible for some of the most celebrated punk imagery, he emblazoned the slogan ""Beauty is a birthright, reclaim your heritage"" on a variety of coats and caps.

Certainly, the ubiquitous custom of designers collaborating with mass-market labels bears out Ms. Cronberg's observation. Now a gimmick, it was a farseeing strategy when Junya Watanabe tried it over a decade ago. Far from being a copycat with his typically beautiful and ingeniously detailed collaboration with the North Face, Mr. Watanabe was revisiting a trend he may have started. While less skilled designers might be content to slap a Champion logo on their clothing, leave it to Mr. Watanabe to deconstruct an entire North Face duffel and repurpose every part of it in the making of a coat. Dries Van Noten also added others' labels to clothes in the 99th show of his career, situated in a tunnel in the rundown Porte de Versailles area. The labels represented some of the fabric mills like Lovat and Fox Brothers that he has used over the years and were an homage to the real collaborations every design house relies on to survive. Other kinds of beauty -- that of craftsmanship, of real creativity and also of labor -- were quietly honored throughout this week in Paris. This was true in shows by discreet designers like Mr. Van Noten, who revisited his own back pages in a quiet show that tended to bisect the body horizontally with boxy jackets afloat above skinny legs, and equally in a gorgeous one staged by Yohji Yamamoto, a soulful elder statesman with a bone to pick.

Romanticized as Mr. Yamamoto's vision may be of a valorized worker swaggering about in beautiful velvet dusters, sumptuous flowing cloaks and inky jumpsuits, funnel neck coats worn over side striped trousers like those the street-sweepers wear here, or else sky blue tunic-shirts cut like butcher's coats, still, it was welcome. If the political climate makes anything clear, it is the necessity for each of us to take action, using every tool at hand.","Givenchy, Dior Homme and Dries Van Noten use the language of fashion to grapple with 21st-century anxieties.",c09c9880-3953-56bf-b5ee-0c2eb052592a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/26/fashion/26PARISMENS1/26PARISMENS1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=272e944543396bc22fb50b484aef29381496badb7abc929b09d13707b0e1024f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Yohji Yamamoto, men's fall 2017, made the working man the hero.",c09c9880-3953-56bf-b5ee-0c2eb052592a,N24News/imgs/c09c9880-3953-56bf-b5ee-0c2eb052592a.jpg,19
Real Estate,Boons and Banes of the Picturesque,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/realestate/piermont-ny-living-in-boons-and-banes-of-the-picturesque.html,"SHALL WE? Piermont Avenue, the main street, has the kinds of quirky shops restaurants that draw visitors. Its riverfront setting at the foot of the Tallman range helps, too.

DRAPED as it is down the Hudson River face of the Tallman Mountains, Piermont evokes a Mediterranean hillside, or maybe Sausalito, Calif. Either way, it presents a sharp contrast to many of its neighbors in Rockland County. Three miles south of the Tappan Zee Bridge, with a colorful main street of quaint shops and historic homes tucked along the shoreline, it is insulated from the noise of traffic crossing the span between Rockland to Westchester. But at the same time the George Washington Bridge is about 12 miles south, close enough for residents to commute to Manhattan. Not surprisingly, the 0.7-square-mile village in Orangetown, with a three-mile-wide section of the river to its east and the steep hillside behind it, has become a refuge for artists, musicians, authors and others seeking a peaceful respite from the clamor of everyday life. ""This is definitely not a place to come and build a McMansion,"" said Joan Dye Gussow, professor emerita at Columbia University, environmentalist and author of ""This Organic Life: Confessions of a Suburban Homesteader"" (Chelsea Green Publishing, 2002), among other books. Ms. Gussow, 83, moved to Piermont with her husband, Alan, a painter, in 1995. The house they bought with the intention of renovating it turned out to be unsalvageable, so they built another on its footprint for about $400,000: a three-bedroom two-bath Italian-style rose-colored stucco residence.

But it wasn't really for the original house that they moved to Piermont. ""I don't know exactly what it was,"" Ms. Gussow said, ""but when I walked down to the river with my husband, it was the open space, the nonsuburban aspect of the site that called to me."" Now a widow, she conducts writing classes in her home and tends a large garden that sweeps down to the water. ""I get up every morning and pull up the shades and look out at the river,"" she said, ""and I just love that."" Piermont has not always been idyllic. As recently as the 1980s, it was so reminiscent of a village laid bare by hard times that Woody Allen chose it for the backdrop of his 1985 movie ""The Purple Rose of Cairo,"" which takes place during the Great Depression. Formerly a factory town, Piermont was the home of the Continental Can Company in the 1950s and then the site of the Piermont Paper Company. When the mill closed in the 1970s, the village fell into decline. It wasn't until the 1990s that developers began building condominiums and town houses on the pier, enticing new residents like Fara Abramson, the owner of a gift shop in nearby New City. After dining out one evening in Piermont with friends, Ms. Abramson, now 43 and the mother of a 9-year-old son, was so smitten that she returned the next morning to buy a three-bedroom three-and-a-half-bath town house with a deck and views of the riverfront, spending $300,000 before even putting her home and business in New City up for sale. ""I could never have taken a chance like that in today's economy,"" said Ms. Abramson, who has since opened another gift shop, Presence, in Piermont, ""but I'm glad I did back then."" So magnetic is the village today, according to residents, that tourists and bicyclists often arrive in droves on weekends. The bicyclists often pay little heed to the designated bike lanes, said Robert Samuels, a former journalist and author who has lived here since 1982. ""They talk loudly and shout back and forth to one another, often waking me out of a sound sleep on a Sunday morning,"" said Mr. Samuels, whose book ""Blue Water, White Water"" (Up the Creek Publishing, 2011) details his struggle with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a muscle disorder.

But other than the bicyclists and high annual property taxes, most of Piermont's 2,500 residents consider their village as close to perfect as it gets, said Mr. Samuels, the president of the 500-member civic association. Ash Street winds down from Route 9W, its various house styles on display: stone homes built in the 1700s, Greek Revivals dating to the 1800s, Victorians, ranches, split-levels and contemporaries. Mr. Samuels and his companion, Karen Brown, a retired social worker, live in a barn-red wheelchair-accessible modular home on Sparkill Creek that he built for $175,000 when he moved to town 30 years ago. As David Sanders, president and founder of Sanders Properties in Nyack, puts it, residential real estate in Piermont attracts ""a very creative, do-your-own-kind-of-thing buyer."" A waterfront section known as Bogertown is home to renovated 19th-century fishermen's shacks dating to the period of Dutch immigration. Nearby on the pier, the newer condos and town houses built in the late 1900s have a distinctly modern feel, with an original 12-by-28-foot flywheel from the paper factory era prominently displayed among the more recent real estate. Because it was too heavy to remove, the flywheel remains mounted on a concrete base that was part of the original factory floor. The tableau recalls the pier's history, yet with its resemblance to a modern sculpture seems in keeping with the village's current ethos. Buyers represent ""a cross section, young couples and empty nesters, but not your first-time buyer,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""It's too pricey."" Many in the current market, he added, are paying with cash. The median price of a single-family home at the end of 2011 was $550,000, down 19 percent from $675,000 in 2007. The median for a condo dropped to $250,000 from $595,000 in 2007, just before the market tanked, he said.

Listings include: a two-bedroom two-bath penthouse condo in a gated complex next to the river, listed at $769,000 with taxes of $16,150 a year; a four-bedroom five-bath Victorian with river views and two fireplaces, listed at $1.499 million with taxes of $21,510; and a 10-bedroom 8-bath 1890s castle on 18 acres with a cottage, a barn and a pool, listed at $8.5 million, with taxes of $78,570. From April 18, 2011, to the same date this year, 9 single-family homes sold in Piermont, spending an average of 146 days on the market; 23 condos sold during that time, taking an average of 111 days, Mr. Sanders said. In all, there are 466 single-family homes, 77-two-families, 19 three-families, 357 condos and 100 rentals, said Brian J. Kenney, Orangetown's assessor and a consultant to the village. The South Orangetown Central School District -- Palisades, Sparkill, Tappan, Piermont, Grandview, Upper Nyack and part of Blauvelt -- has 3,400 students in five schools: William O. Schaefer School in Tappan, for kindergarten and Grade 1; Tappan Zee Elementary in Piermont for Grades 2 and 3; Cottage Lane Elementary in Blauvelt, for Grades 4 and 5; South Orangetown Middle School in Blauvelt, for Grades 6 through 8; and Tappan Zee High School in Orangeburg for Grades 9 through 12. There is also a special-needs prekindergarten program at the Schaefer school. Among fourth-graders at Cottage Lane last year, 77 percent met standards in English, 85 percent in math, versus 56.7 and 66.6 percent statewide, said Brian Culot, the principal.

SAT averages were 529 in reading, 557 in math and 531 in writing, versus 514, 497 and 489 statewide. There is plenty to do along the waterfront and on the pier, said Chris Sanders, Piermont's part-time mayor. Village children spend afternoons and weekends biking on the pier, crabbing and fishing in the river, and kayaking and canoeing on the river or Sparkill Creek. Mayor Sanders, along with his son, Benjamin, 15, and his wife, Marlene, a ceramic artist, also often hike in Tallman Mountain State Park, ""where we feel like we're a million miles away from the city, even though we can see the skyline from the top of the mountain,"" he said. Mayor Sanders, a marketing executive who commutes to Manhattan, describes the family house -- a three-bedroom mid-1800s pink shingle-style dwelling that cost about $350,000 15 years ago -- as ""adorable.""",A village draped down the Hudson River face of the Tallman Mountains presents a sharp contrast to many of its neighbors in Rockland County.,4dc0684e-3717-50f3-af98-54b787a9d45f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/04/29/realestate/27LIVINGIN_SPAN/27LIVINGIN_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=360&w=600&s=ef35dbb4853c92636845c07cf4a8ca26a6afcb70c955b77cf06968ea289b7113&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"SHALL WE?

Automobiles,Car Seats to Face Crash-Test Standards,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/23/automobiles/nhtsa-proposes-child-seat-side-impact-rule.html,"DETROIT -- Federal regulators moved on Wednesday to address a glaring hole in auto safety rules by proposing new crash-test standards to better protect children in car seats. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced it was seeking a new rule that requires child car seats to withstand side-impact collisions of up to 30 miles an hour. The proposal, which followed a directive from Congress and has been years in the making, is considered a major step in a larger effort to improve the safety of car seats for small children. Up to now, federal rules have covered only how well car seats protect children in crashes from the front. Under the proposed rule, the seats would for the first time have to pass a test that simulates a typical side-impact vehicle crash.

David Friedman, the agency's administrator, called the proposed side-impact rule a ""significant"" measure that could prevent as many as five deaths and more than 60 injuries a year. ""Car seats are one of the most essential tools we have for keeping young people safe in vehicles,"" Mr. Friedman said in a conference call at the Washington Auto Show. Under the proposal, manufacturers would have up to three years to alter or adjust their products to meet the new requirements. Consumers could then buy a newer model to replace older ones. The new test is designed to assess how various car seat models protect children weighing up to 40 pounds from head trauma and other injuries in highway accidents. The proposed tests are similar to a so-called T-bone crash. The tests will position a car seat on a crash-test sled traveling at 15 miles an hour. Then the sled will be rammed from the side by another sled moving at 30 miles an hour. The test will determine how well a particular car seat protects a child passenger from a vehicle's door crushing, as well as the overall impact of the crash. Regulators plan to use two crash-test dummies in the tests -- one that replicates a 12-month-old child and another representing a 3-year-old.

Deaths of children in car seats have been declining in recent years, to 397 in 2011, down from a total of 614 in 2002. But while car seat restraints are considered to be effective, medical and auto safety experts said more needed to be done. Accidental injury is the leading cause of child death in the United States, according to Matthew R. Maltese, head of biomechanics research at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and auto accidents are high on the list of what causes those injuries. Side-impact crashes can hurt children in a variety of ways. While the door can intrude and strike a child in a car seat, the sheer impact of a collision can cause a child's head to move suddenly and hit the seat or a part of the vehicle's interior. ""In a side crash, the vehicle is moving laterally and often forward, and the door also intrudes into your space,"" Mr. Maltese said. ""It all happens in a short period of time -- tenths of seconds."" Mr. Friedman said that under the proposed a rule, every child car-seat model must pass the side-impact test before it could be sold to the public. The rule should help parents choose car seats without relying solely on marketing claims made by their manufacturers. ""In the big picture, this is a great thing,"" said Jennifer Stockburger, an official at the Consumer Reports automotive testing center.

The proposed rule will be subject to a 90-day comment period by the public. Regulators will then review the comments before issuing a final rule. Manufacturers will have up to three years to alter or adjust their products to meet the new requirements. While the proposed rule was hailed in the auto safety community, one longtime safety advocate criticized the length of time it has taken for the government to take action. ""The sad part is that it has taken so long to protect children,"" said Clarence M. Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington. ""When it takes about 15 years to issue a rule, that's not giving children enough priority."" Mr. Friedman, who took over this week as the safety agency's acting administrator, said he expected the agency to move aggressively on other child safety issues. One of the most vexing problems for parents is still the confusion over how to install a child car seat. The safety agency estimates that three out of every four car seats are installed improperly. Often times, parents need to be instructed by professionals to understand how to use various anchors and tethers that automakers are required to provide in their models.",A proposed rule to require child-seat manufacturers to meet minimum federal standards for side-impact crashes has been added to the Federal Register.,982071a1-0b4c-5f7a-88b9-558376abe541,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/23/automobiles/23CARSEAT-image/23CARSEAT-image-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=338&w=600&s=e65345700e51b7aa82fdffb37ea94cc420b9cd8d0a3c7b45dfe09fc5cadd7d6b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed a rule that would increase the side-impact safety on car seats.,982071a1-0b4c-5f7a-88b9-558376abe541,N24News/imgs/982071a1-0b4c-5f7a-88b9-558376abe541.jpg,23
Sports,What We Learned From Week 7 of the N.F.L. Season,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/25/sports/football/nfl-results.html,"* None A schedule change made Sunday night special. Fearing that Tampa Bay's game in Las Vegas could be postponed because of coronavirus precautions, the N.F.L. moved Seattle's game in Arizona to the prime time spot. As a result, a national audience was treated to a thriller, with the Seahawks taking a lead in the game's first four minutes and not trailing again until the final play of overtime, when Arizona's Zane Gonzalez connected on a 48-yard field goal that gave the Cardinals a shocking 37-34 victory. Russell Wilson threw for 388 yards and rushed for 84, Kyler Murray threw for 360 and rushed for 67, and Tyler Lockett had 200 yards receiving and three touchdowns. But it was Arizona's defense stepping up in overtime that decided the game. Arizona's pass rush came alive in that extra period, sacking Wilson twice and pressuring him several other times, leading to Seattle's last offensive play in which Wilson rushed a bad pass and had it intercepted by seldom-used linebacker Isaiah Simmons, who put his team in the position to win. ""These are the games you honestly dream about,"" Murray said after his team improved to 5-2 while handing Seattle its first loss of the season.
* None Ohio suddenly has an intrastate rivalry. A game between Cincinnati and Cleveland got off to an inauspicious start when Joe Burrow and Baker Mayfield were both intercepted on their first drives. Odell Beckham Jr. of the Browns was lost to injury on that opening drive, and the Bengals were leading by 17-10 at halftime. But in the second half, the game morphed into a heavyweight bout between Mayfield, the No. 1 pick in the 2018 draft, and Burrow, the No. 1 pick in 2020. Mayfield won the day, finding Donovan Peoples-Jones for a 24-yard touchdown with 11 seconds remaining that put Cleveland ahead to say, 37-34. But Burrow nearly kept up, throwing for 406 yards and three touchdowns.
* None Kansas City can win a game without much help from its offense. Playing in snowy conditions in Denver, the Chiefs were nowhere near their best when they had the ball, going 0 for 8 on third down conversion attempts. But Daniel Sorensen contributed a pick-six, Byron Pringle had a 102-yard kickoff return and the Chiefs demolished the Broncos, 43-16, despite Denver having dramatic advantages in total yards and time of possession.

San Francisco's top running back is Raheem Mostert. Coach Kyle Shanahan may actually prefer Tevin Coleman. The 49ers' third-stringer is Jerick McKinnon, and their highest paid runner out of the backfield is fullback Kyle Juszczyk. Because of injuries to Mostert, Coleman and McKinnon, the team turned to Wilson on Sunday and the former standout for North Texas had the game of his life, racing for 112 yards and scoring three touchdowns. Keeping up with the theme of the season, however, Wilson's big day ended abruptly when he injured his ankle while scoring his third touchdown. The team has yet to weigh in on the full extent of the injury, but Shanahan said it was ""not looking great.""

Buccaneers 45, Raiders 20 Tom Brady continued to spread the ball around, throwing touchdown passes to four different receivers, and Tampa Bay kept its momentum from last week's blowout win over the Packers. Cardinals 37, Seahawks 34 Arizona had several moments that would have caused a lesser team to quit. There was Budda Baker being chased down by DK Metcalf on what would have been a 98-yard interception return for a touchdown. Zane Gonzalez missed an attempt at a game-winner from 41 yards during the Cardinals' first possession in overtime. And Metcalf had what appeared to be a 48-yard game-winning touchdown in overtime negated by a holding penalty. But the Cardinals kept pushing until they had the win in hand.

Chargers 39, Jaguars 29 Justin Herbert got his first career win, and he did it in a big way by throwing for 347 yards and three touchdowns while also running in a score. Herbert has thrown for at least 250 yards in each of his first five starts, a feat previously only accomplished by Patrick Mahomes, who did it in his first 10. Lions 23, Falcons 22 Detroit didn't get much production out of its running backs, but Matthew Stafford threw for 340 yards and a touchdown and the Lions won for the third time in four games. This was the 36th game-winning drive of Stafford's career, according to Pro Football Reference, which trails only Drew Brees (37) since 2009. Footballers 25, Cowboys 3 Ezekiel Elliott was held to just 45 yards rushing, had a ball bounce off him for an interception and made mistakes in pass protection. Blame the team's struggles on Dallas's second- and third-string quarterbacks all you want, but Elliott isn't getting the job done.","Arizona shocked Seattle in overtime, Baker Mayfield caught fire after a rough start and the Steelers held on to beat the Titans.",82d7d0c9-cb75-5e2b-b0b6-d8b7be26cb5b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/25/sports/25nfl-wwl-top3/25nfl-wwl-top3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c5079e0dd5531686cf7d82505753689775fc978474c10ffeeab5fa0447eed4a2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Byron Murphy and Isaiah Simmons celebrated after Simmons intercepted a Russell Wilson pass in overtime, helping set up Arizona's game-winning field goal.",82d7d0c9-cb75-5e2b-b0b6-d8b7be26cb5b,N24News/imgs/82d7d0c9-cb75-5e2b-b0b6-d8b7be26cb5b.jpg,9
Sports,Are the Bears That Good or Are the Falcons That Bad?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/sports/football/nick-foles-chicago-bears-atlanta-falcons.html,"Are the Bears That Good or Are the Falcons That Bad?

Bears 30, Falcons 26. If you didn't closely follow the N.F.L. weekend action, you might guess it was a decent game, closely contested. But hidden beneath the score was a most unlikely game, played by two teams whose fortunes are now on drastically different trajectories. The Atlanta Falcons and the Chicago Bears were expected to be OK this season, perhaps .500. Last year they were 7-9 and 8-8. They may still wind up around those marks, but their starts show that one team is reeling and the other seems to be flying high, though there are ripples of concern. After close victories over the Detroit Lions and the Giants, the Bears were close to losing their perfect record on Sunday, falling behind the Falcons, 16-10, at the half and 26-10 through three quarters. Enter Nick Foles. Signed in the off-season to a big contract, Foles unaccountably had been beaten out for the starting quarterback job by the three-year incumbent, Mitch Trubisky, who has electrified few in Chicago in his tenure.

The Bears decided to turn to Foles in the third quarter, still down, 26-10, with more than nine minutes left. But three touchdown passes later, the Bears had completed an improbable comeback. Foles even had two other touchdown passes overturned. Foles is still best remembered for subbing for an injured Carson Wentz and leading the Philadelphia Eagles to their only Super Bowl victory, in the 2017 season. Many fans are still ruing his departure, especially as Wentz has led that team to an uninspiring 0-2-1 start. ""It kind of happened out of nowhere,"" Trubisky told reporters of his abrupt benching. ""I just accepted the news.""

That should end the 3-0 Bears' quarterback controversy but it's still unclear what kind of team Foles is inheriting after a perfect start that's been less than worldbeating. The Bears beat the Lions in Week 1 only after Detroit running back D'Andre Swift dropped a potential game-winning pass in the end zone. They beat the Giants in Week 2 after receiver Golden Tate was called for pushing off a defender, nearing a late touchdown. After Sunday's action, there were still eight unbeaten N.F.L. teams. Computer rankings understandably put the Baltimore Ravens and Kansas City Chiefs, who meet Monday night, at the top. Of the unbeatens, the Bears rank last, even behind the Bills. Though the Bears are tied at the top of the N.F.C. North with the Packers, another team that nominally came into the season with questions about its quarterback, Green Bay's 3-0 season looks a lot more impressive. Of course, even if the Bears revert to mediocrity, they still could go, say, 7-6, the rest of the way and comfortably make the playoffs, which were expanded to 14 teams this season. That's true even though a glance down Chicago's roster seems to show little in the way of star power. The Bears have a strong defensive unit on paper, but the skill offensive positions are not chock-full of talent. Historically, 3-0 teams make the playoffs much more often than not, but you might not be wise to bet on the Bears at even money. For the Falcons, things are more unambiguous. The thing about sports is, for every comeback, there's a collapse. And, yeah, the Falcons collapsed on Sunday. For the second week in a row.

But after dropping their opener to the Seahawks, the Falcons had a nightmare against the Cowboys, blowing a 39-24 lead in the last eight minutes of the game. The debacle was capped by an onside kick by Dallas that several Falcons merely watched as it rolled by before the Cowboys recovered, a phenomenon that had the team's owner convinced that players did not know the rules and its coach arguing on talk radio that they definitely did. Even before this week, Coach Dan Quinn was considered one of the most likely coaches to be fired, perhaps trailing only Adam Gase of the Jets. Sunday's game may have moved him to No. 1. It was the first time in 20 years a team blew two 15-point-plus leads in the fourth quarter in the same season, The Associated Press reported. ESPN's live GameCast gave the Falcons up to a 99 percent chance of winning late in both of those games. Like the Bears, the Falcons could still change the course of their season. Given their close losses and the questions around the Bears, you could probably even make a contrarian case that they are the better team. But the bottom line is, the teams both have a 3 in their records after three games. And the Bears are the team with the 3 on the better side.",The Chicago Bears started the season with a 3-0 record and a quarterback controversy.

Automobiles,"Two Fewer Cylinders, Not That You'll Notice",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/automobiles/bmw-528i-fewer-cylinders-not-that-youll-notice.html,"WITH gasoline prices likely to remain over $3 a gallon for some time, fuel economy is on the minds of most vehicle buyers. And with the government's Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations scheduled to reach 54.5 m.p.g. by 2025, auto executives, including those whose cars are at the high end of the price scale, are also focused on squeezing more miles from every gallon. In fact, the fuel economy challenge is probably tougher for luxury brands like BMW, Jaguar, Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz. Unlike the Cadillac division of General Motors, or the Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Lamborghini and Porsche units of the Volkswagen Group, the stand-alone premium carmakers sell few of the small, efficient vehicles that would offset the thirstiness of their big, powerful luxury models -- at least in the United States. For that reason, the latest fuel economy technologies are introduced most rapidly in these luxury models, which have price tags that can absorb the added cost of the advanced hardware. A perfect example of this trend is the 2012 BMW 528i. The 5 Series is BMW's midsize model offering, introduced in its latest form as a 2011 model. It is available with a variety of engines, but the biggest seller has always been the version with the smallest displacement, known for at least two decades as the 525i or the 528i.

Under their hoods lay one of BMW's in-line 6-cylinder engines of 2.5 to 3 liters, all justly lauded for their ample thrust and silky smoothness. Smaller engines have generally been regarded as beneath the dignity of the 5 Series -- and most other BMWs -- sold in America. This thinking goes out the window with the release of the 2012 528i, which is powered by a 2-liter engine having just 4 cylinders. It's an unusually small power plant for a car that in its basic rear-drive configuration weighs about 3,800 pounds -- and, with just a few checkmarks on the option list, can cost $60,000. There is but one motivation for this change: fuel efficiency. The window sticker on my test car, a 528i xDrive that weighed closer to 4,000 pounds, promised 22 miles per gallon in town and 32 on the highway, per the Environmental Protection Agency's rating. That's a significant step up from the 18 city and 27 highway rating of the previous-generation 528i, which was powered by 3-liter 6-cylinder coupled to a 6-speed automatic transmission. (BMW's model designations no longer reflect the actual engine displacement, but are assigned according to their general horsepower levels). Based on the E.P.A. ratings, much of that fuel economy improvement came from the switch to 8-speed automatics for the new 5 Series, with some of it a result of the smaller engine.

It's not hard to grasp that a small engine would consume less fuel than a big one, especially for drivers who have a lead foot. What is not as widely understood is that smaller engines are more efficient at every power level. In other words, if it takes 25 horsepower to push the 528i down the highway at a steady 75 miles an hour, a 2-liter engine will use less fuel to generate those 25 horses than a 3-liter engine will. That's because engines are more efficient when they are working harder, and small engines are almost always working harder than big ones. This is also why cars are getting more gear ratios in their transmissions -- to let their engines maintain lower r.p.m. levels at highway speeds. An engine producing 25 horsepower at 2,000 r.p.m. must work each cylinder harder than it would at 3,000 r.p.m. -- and that translates into lower fuel consumption. There are drawbacks to such a strategy, though. Because a small, low-revving engine is already working pretty hard, there is little reserve power available when the driver floors the accelerator. An automatic transmission can downshift, of course, but if it has to kick down every time you ask for a bit more speed, the car will feel gutless and unsatisfying. In other words, not very BMW-like. A solution chosen by BMW, and many other automakers, is turbocharging, which captures the energy in the engine's hot exhaust gases to spin a compressor that pumps extra air into the cylinders. If you force-feed a 2-liter engine the same amount of air and fuel that a 3-liter engine would consume, you get 3-liter power and then some. Yet under most circumstances, you still get the innate fuel efficiency of the 2-liter engine. Turbochargers have been around for decades, but only in recent years have they realized the benefits of several modern technologies. Developments like direct fuel injection, variable valve timing and computerized engine controls work together to make small turbo engines a viable path to fuel efficiency.

With the same or greater peak output coming at lower engine speeds, the 4-cylinder 528i is nearly half a second quicker to 60 m.p.h. than its 6-cylinder predecessor, according to BMW. In normal driving, the new 528 feels more energetic than you would expect for a two-ton car with a 2-liter engine. Acceleration from stoplights was strong and there was plenty of urge even at 80 m.p.h. While there's no question that the 2012 528i delivers both better performance and higher fuel economy than its 6-cylinder predecessor, smooth operation and refined character are equally important in a luxury car. In those areas, a critical driver will sense some rough spots. For example, when the engine is cold, it idles at around 800 r.p.m. -- and throbs somewhat like a diesel. With two fewer cylinders, the engine's firing impulses are naturally farther apart, and the driver feels the difference. Once the engine warms up, though, the idle drops to 700 r.p.m. and the engine feels much smoother. With the engine warm, however, the stop-start system engages, shutting off the engine at traffic lights. This feature saves fuel, especially in urban driving, but you instantly notice when the engine has been shut off. I would have expected BMW to apply some tuning magic to make this operation less apparent. At 75 m.p.h. with the transmission in eighth gear, the 4-cylinder is revving at only about 2,100 r.p.m. and feels completely unobtrusive. But at a steady 50 m.p.h., also in eighth gear, the r.p.m. drops to 1,400, generating a slight drone that no 6-cylinder BMW ever produced. Yet even at such low engine speeds acceleration is available with a push on the gas pedal, a benefit of the turbocharger's helping hand. Push the pedal farther and the transmission downshifts smoothly -- even when it must reach for a gear two, three or even five steps lower in response to the driver's call for maximum acceleration. The 8-speed automatic is almost telepathic in the way it anticipates your needs and selects the right gear.

On one highway run that averaged 74 m.p.h., the trip computer calculated 32 m.p.g. Over all, I averaged better than 25 m.p.g. in fairly typical suburban driving. That's outstanding for a lavishly equipped all-wheel-drive luxury sedan that delivers such brisk performance. Other than the new 4-cylinder powertrain, the 2012 528i is little changed from last year. Some might say that it resembles the 7 and 3 Series sedans too much -- the same sausage, cut to a different length. But unlike its awkward fifth-generation predecessor, the car is conventionally handsome in the husky and muscular way of a German soccer fullback. The cabin is beautifully finished and fitted with many comfort and convenience features. But I was a bit taken aback when I noticed that despite my test car's $61,125 sticker price, another $15,000 in available options could have been added. And while this 5 Series is a couple of inches longer than its predecessor, interior space remains less than generous. For those who still think of BMWs as primarily sport sedans, this 528i will not be particularly satisfying. While smooth, responsive and capable, it never pulls at its leash. Not much information makes it through the steering system to disturb -- or inform -- the driver. The ride is comfortable and well-controlled, but the size and weight of the car don't encourage one to toss it around. Of course, with the exception of my test car's sport package, the 528i xDrive is the most workaday and least athletic version of the 5 Series. There are more entertaining variations with 6- and 8-cylinder engines, ranging from 300 horsepower up to the very sporting 560-horsepower M5, with appropriate upgrades in running gear. For the majority of 5 Series buyers, however, the new powertrain is a great success, achieving about 20 percent better fuel economy than the fifth-generation model they might be trading in, with even better performance and only a few subtle losses of refinement.",A turbocharged 4-cylinder engine helps the new 528i achieve better performance and higher fuel economy than its predecessor.,1a4db597-4875-5cce-b074-f505ace2f433,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/08/12/automobiles/12WHEE1/12WHEE1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=350&w=600&s=020f88b037a15c3bdd919365aa3a3cb4f3a09c8c34d70c99b3f215247acf08c8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"NAME GAME  A 2-liter 4-cylinder engine powers the 2012 528i, replacing the in-line 6 that has been BMW's hallmark.",1a4db597-4875-5cce-b074-f505ace2f433,N24News/imgs/1a4db597-4875-5cce-b074-f505ace2f433.jpg,23
Health,Anthem Will Exit Health Insurance Exchange in Ohio,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/health/anthem-health-insurance-exchanges-ohio.html,"Anthem, one of the nation's largest insurers and a major player in the individual insurance market created by the federal health care law, announced Tuesday that it would stop offering policies in the Ohio marketplace next year. Although its departure would leave a small number of people -- roughly 10,500 who live in about a fifth of the state's counties -- without an insurance carrier, the move was seized on by Republicans as more evidence that the markets are ""collapsing"" under the Affordable Care Act. President Trump, meeting with congressional leaders on Tuesday, said it was more proof that insurers are ""fleeing and leaving"" the marketplaces and added that it was essential for Congress to pass a bill repealing the health law this summer. Republican senators said on Tuesday that they were trying to reach agreement on some major issues, especially Medicaid. Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, said that Republican senators spent much of a meeting on Tuesday with Vice President Mike Pence discussing health care. Mr. Barrasso outlined some differences with the bill that passed the House.

The senators want ""a smoother glide path, rather than an abrupt cutoff,"" of Medicaid expansion funds that the federal government provides in 31 states, he said. Some senators have also expressed concerns about provisions in the House bill that would allow states to seek waivers from certain federal insurance standards, including one that prohibits companies from charging higher premiums to people with pre-existing conditions. Senate Republicans, however, have not agreed on which provisions could be waived. Congressional Republicans have said they plan to provide tens of billions of dollars to hold down premiums, stabilize insurance markets and help cover high-cost patients in the next decade. But it is unclear whether an injection of federal money will come soon enough to influence other insurers' decisions about participating in the marketplaces in 2018. Besides Ohio, Anthem operates for-profit Blue Cross plans in more than a dozen states. The company said on Tuesday that it had not yet made a decision about its participation in those exchanges, but it and other companies have grown increasingly anxious as efforts by Congress drag on. Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said the exit of insurers was ""a problem not just in Ohio but across the country,"" and he blamed the existing law for ""a declining number of viable health care choices for families and small businesses.""

Democrats countered that the market is shaky because of efforts by the Trump administration and congressional Republicans to undermine the law, including their continued threat to stop providing critical funding to low-income individuals to better afford plans. ""They own this health care system now,"" said Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio. ""Because they fiddled for the last five months and injected more uncertainty into the insurance market, premiums have gone up and insurance companies have pulled out."" Federal and state deadlines are quickly approaching this month for insurers to decide if they will remain in the marketplaces and how to price their plans for 2018. While Anthem had warned that it might leave some or all of the states where it offers individual plans, its exit from Ohio signals that even some of the market's stalwarts are unnerved. Aetna and Humana have said they do not plan to participate next year after losing money, but Anthem appeared be turning the corner. If Anthem were to exit the federal health insurance exchanges entirely, ""there could be hundreds of thousands of people without any option on the exchange,"" said Cynthia Cox, an executive at the Kaiser Family Foundation. In the last few weeks, two other Blue Cross companies announced that they were dropping out of exchanges, in Nebraska and in parts of Kansas and Missouri. Iowa's Blue Cross plan has also said it does not plan to offer plans on the exchange next year. The exit leaves insurance regulators with the prospect that some of their residents may not be offered a plan in 2018.

""For the past few years we have seen a weakening in the federal insurance marketplace as a number of companies have withdrawn from the exchange,"" the Ohio insurance agency said in an email. ""We have always argued the private insurance market is the most severely impacted by the federal law and that is where congressional action is needed to restore stability."" Even when insurers are staying, the uncertainty and concern over the health of people in the market is leading many to file eye-popping rate increases for next year. In Maine, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care is asking for an average price increase of about 40 percent, while Anthem, which warned state regulators that it might have to revisit its plans, depending on what happens, wants a 21-percent increase. Some state regulators are asking the insurers to file various rates based on what happens, but the different scenarios can lead to much higher rates. In Pennsylvania, Teresa Miller, the state's insurance commissioner, said in a statement this month that the five carriers had requested an average increase of 9 percent, demonstrating that the market ""is stabilizing and insurers are better understanding the markets and the population they serve."" But the increases could be much higher. Prices would go up by 20 percent if there was no longer funding for subsidies, the regulator said. Rates could also be higher if the Trump administration does not enforce the tax penalty on people without insurance.","The insurer's decision to leave the Affordable Care Act marketplace in 2018 was seized on by Republicans as more evidence that the markets are ""collapsing"" under the law.",27cbaf4f-fb7b-52cc-a53c-7997b45fc946,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/07/science/07anthem-web/07anthem-web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=fa39bf41edfc84ea25021f494e02fca32e91ef9103b31ef754bad2ddafed323d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Anthem said on Tuesday it will stop offering policies on the Ohio individual health insurance marketplace next year.,27cbaf4f-fb7b-52cc-a53c-7997b45fc946,N24News/imgs/27cbaf4f-fb7b-52cc-a53c-7997b45fc946.jpg,1

Dance,Review: Ratmansky's 'The Sleeping Beauty' Has Premiere in California,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/11/arts/dance/review-ratmanskys-the-sleeping-beauty-has-premiere-in-california.html,"The Sleeping Beauty Nancy Raffa as Carabosse in Alexei Ratmansky's production at Segerstrom Hall in Costa Mesa, Calif. The production draws on Marius Petipa's choreography from the ballet's 1890 premiere in Russia.

COSTA MESA, Calif. -- The wealth of detail that informs American Ballet Theater's new production of ""The Sleeping Beauty"" brings to life a classic that has often gone stale. Much more, however, is also achieved: The old ballet has become transformed into something full of surprises. Though the production, staged by Alexei Ratmansky, Ballet Theater's artist in residence, is based on deep research into the ballet's original 1890 production and various records from 1890 to 1906, it doesn't feel quaint or dated or archival. It feels loved: The characters and their often unfamiliar steps glow from within. If you think you know ""Beauty,"" this production, which had its first performances here last week, teaches you that you don't. In May and June, the production will reach the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, where it will be the subject of keen scrutiny (and by which time it may have changed). I learned much about it just by listening to the happy response of the Costa Mesa audience to the ballet's many charms at each performance in the 3,000-seat Segerstrom Hall. The sound of children gurgling with delight at Act III's fairy-tale divertissements (Puss-in-Boots, the Bluebird, Cinderella, Red Riding Hood, Hop-o'-My-Thumb and others) stays in my ears. I had booked to see five casts and expected this to be a chore. But it only deepened the fascination. These were performances that made me feel I was only just starting to become acquainted with both ""Sleeping Beauty"" and the choreographer of its St. Petersburg 1890 premiere, Marius Petipa.

Above all, this staging is a triumph of vivifying style. It's the finest reconstruction I've ever seen of a dance work. When the Mariinsky Ballet staged a comparable ""Sleeping Beauty"" in 1999, the dancers showed no interest in any 1890-1910 idiom. (The ballerinas' absurdly high extensions, so ill-suited to their period attire, were simply the most obvious anachronism.) Here, however, Ballet Theater's dancers seem to cherish the challenges of the unfamiliar. We see both unknown steps and known steps given completely new accents. These performers don't look cramped by lifting their legs lower than shoulder height or performing with extreme turnout of the legs. They look released, motivated and musical. Their classical style looks enriched, and their skills as dance actors seem rekindled. Tempos for Tchaikovsky's superlative score are marvelously fast. You can feel the kinesthetic excitement of rapid, complex footwork; upper bodies are mobile, and the performers breathe in both dances and in mime. To talk technique: Chaine turns (a traveling step customarily performed on point by women today) are delivered here on half-point and with each dancer's face addressing the audience when ""spotting"" to focus each revolution; retires and passes (steps and positions in which the working foot is usually raised to touch the other knee) are here at calf height; and arm positions are often softer, less grand, but more inflected than we are used to seeing. Amazingly, Ballet Theater's performers do all this as if it were right and natural -- as if they believe in it, love it and have never moved any other way. My enthusiasm was tempered. The ballet's most enchantingly eloquent music, depicting the palace asleep before the Awakening, is cut. Nothing here is dull, but also nothing is overwhelming, at least in these first performances. The wicked fairy, Carabosse (played by a woman at some performances and by a man at others), is vividly mimed but not sensational. The heroine, Aurora -- played by five ballerinas in California -- is entirely absorbing in her dances but builds no huge excitement. You feel Mr. Ratmansky's transforming touch, however, most of all if you saw the ballerina Diana Vishneva dance Aurora in the Mariinsky's 1999 production, where she was all unfocused, bland gymnasticism. Here, by contrast, where Ms. Vishneva's legs seldom sweep above hip height, she is more youthful, nuanced, poetic and engaging.

Other casts (Paloma Herrera with Denis Nedak, Isabella Boylston with Joseph Gorak, Hee Seo with Cory Stearns, Gillian Murphy with Alexandre Hammoudi) were no less rewarding. At a few points, Mr. Ratmansky has even supplied his ballerinas with alternative options from the old notation. Brightest and most musical of all were Ms. Boylston, the company's newest principal, and her partner, Mr. Gorak (still a soloist), in their debuts in the lead roles: No one more eagerly lapped up the challenges of these intricate dances. But even Ms. Herrera and Ms. Murphy, who often danced Aurora well in the company's misbegotten 2007-13 production, looked happily stimulated, combining artistic experience with freshness. Ms. Vishneva's partner, Marcelo Gomes, is a marvel of authority as the Prince. He is also (like Nancy Raffa and Craig Salstein) a biting, vehement Carabosse. Among a long list of other performers, I single out Victor Barbee and, especially, Roman Zhurbin as the King; April Giangeruso as the Prologue fairy godmother (the one who points fingers in her variation); Skylar Brandt, Cassandra Trenary, Christine Shevchenko and Ms. Boylston as the Diamond Fairy in Act III; and Gabe Stone Shayer as a blithe Bluebird sweetly hanging in the air amid shimmering jumps. The audience rightly applauds the detail, depth, color and period evocation of Richard Hudson's sets and costumes, although these prompt more complicated reactions than any other element. They are inspired by those of Leon Bakst, who designed Serge Diaghilev's 1921 London production of this classic. It takes time to adjust to ""Beauty"" in knee-length tutus and with no male dancer's legs fully outlined in tights; but this soon becomes part of the production's charm. Problems? The color spectrums of each act are seldom satisfying over all, despite individual delights. The 116 years between the Prologue and Act III are shown in an unchanging Baroque era. The Sleep's falling lilac petals and the Vision's golden leaves (adorning the white tutus) are greeting-card tacky. Aurora and the Prince perform their Wedding pas de deux in what looks like Baroque underwear. I have often said that ""Beauty,"" more than any other of the old ballets, reminds me of what Pasternak said he loved in Pushkin's poetry: It is full of things. And the greatest pleasure of these performances was to feel that again, not least in things I'd never encountered in this ballet. Carabosse's rats make an absurd parody of courtly dancing in the Prologue. Cinderella pumps her bellows teasingly in the face of the prince who has come to claim her. Hop-o'-My-Thumb tells two of his brothers to steal the seven-league boots of the sleeping ogre, and the boys beat an exit with the awakened ogre in hot pursuit with a meat cleaver. The way classical dancing emerges out of this tapestry, both courtly and mythic, is entrancing. It becomes an expression of a belief in manners, form, beauty and, beyond all that, the life force.","American Ballet Theater's new production of Tchaikovsky and Marius Petipa's fairy tale opens at Segerstrom Hall in Costa Mesa, Calif.",cfe37ec8-3c85-5b03-89be-e7a4c76b4ca7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/11/arts/11RATMANSKYJP/11RATMANSKYJP-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=6a8b659853d80e0b16d2c471ab869325523787fdb866b3aa3faaed142fd22154&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Sleeping Beauty  Nancy Raffa as Carabosse in Alexei Ratmansky's production at Segerstrom Hall in Costa Mesa, Calif.

Sports,Tears and Disbelief as Coronavirus Cancels Youth Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/sports/coronavirus-canceled-youth-sports.html,"Little League baseball has shut down. Youth lacrosse and soccer clubs have suspended their seasons. Travel teams across all sports have been grounded. The coronavirus pandemic has done what generations of overbearing parents and coaches have failed to do: send millions of boys and girls to the sideline. The impact of the emerging health crisis was felt immediately at the high school level as state championships in basketball, ice hockey and wrestling were canceled from Montana to New Jersey. At the youth level, an indefinite pause in practices, games and tournaments promises to upset the rhythms of countless families and deal a significant blow to the youth sports economy. The tough decisions were not always welcome. In La Crosse, Wis., the seniors on the Aquinas High School girls' basketball team were 107-3 through four years heading into this weekend's championship game. Instead, Wisconsin officials canceled the game and ended the team's shot at a third straight state title.

""It was a rush of disbelief, disappointment and tears because it's over, and you're not getting to finish what you started,"" said the team's coach, Dave Donarski, whose daughter Lexi, an Iowa State recruit and McDonald's all-American, was supposed to be playing her final high school game. Donarski said he understood it was the right call, but he was still disappointed for his team. ""Can't we delay it?"" he said. ""Can we give it two weeks? I just wished we had pumped the brakes a bit. I think it's a little bit of mass hysteria."" Even the most well-informed health professionals felt the hole in their heart at the prospect of missing their daughters and sons compete for who knows how long? Dr. Andrew Stolbach is an emergency physician and a faculty member at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. He also is a wrestling coach for his 12-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter's club in Baltimore. ""I was disappointed when they canceled our state tournament -- there were kids graduating from the program that I've known for five years that are not going to get a proper send-off,"" Dr. Stolbach said. ""But we don't need organized sports right now when we are trying to slow this virus down. You're not just bringing kids to games. You are bringing parents and grandparents together. It's just not necessary to put so many people at risk.""

On Thursday, even before Idaho had reported any coronavirus cases, the Idaho High School Activities Association announced that the upcoming state cheer and dance championships would be postponed. ""The scene changed hourly it seemed from Wednesday to the end of the week,"" Bruce Howard, a spokesman for the National Federation of State High School Associations, said. New Jersey, for instance, insisted initially that its tournaments would be held as scheduled, only to encounter logistical difficulties as some host sites, like Rutgers, banned large events and a handful of high schools said they would not send teams to compete. By Thursday, New Jersey officials decided to cancel all championship games. By Sunday morning, only three more states held championships -- Nebraska, New Mexico and Louisiana -- all of which limited fans and people in the venues to fewer than 250 people. Missouri wrapped up some of its championships, but not all, and there was no indication whether the remaining ones would take place, Howard said. With championships not played in two-thirds of the country, the revenue that one million fans generate was gone from state high school association budgets. At Central Park in New York on Sunday, Will Freel, 11, organized a three-on-three basketball tournament for nearly a dozen other sixth graders. On Friday, he learned that his track season was over and his lacrosse season was suspended.

The Aspen Institute's Project Play has set up a website to keep parents abreast of the shifting youth sports landscape as well as to offer tips on keeping their children safe, healthy and exercising. In Massachusetts, the Wellesley High School girls' hockey team had been gunning for a third straight state title, with the championship set for Sunday against Canton High School at TD Garden in Boston. But the team learned after practice on Thursday that all boys' and girls' finals would be canceled, prematurely ending the careers of seven Raiders seniors. One of the senior captains, Bridget Noonan, said the players stayed in the locker room for two hours reflecting upon what they had accomplished in a challenging season: one girl had been out with mononucleosis, several had injuries and nearly everyone was out with flulike symptoms at some point. ""It was more genuine heartbreak than anger,"" Noonan, who will play lacrosse next season at Virginia Tech, said. Another captain, Emily Rourke, who scored the winning goal in last year's state final, said she was with several teammates on Sunday at exactly 5:45 p.m. -- the scheduled start of the final. ""We could just picture so clearly what would be happening,"" said Rourke, who will play hockey next season for Hobart and William Smith Colleges. ""We'd be skating up to take the face-off with all the fans. It just felt really real when it got to 5:45.""

Swimming, too, had cancellations at all levels. The Y.M.C.A. short-course national championship, scheduled for March 30 to April 3 in Greensboro, N.C., will not be held for the first time since 1947. More than 1,400 swimmers -- plus coaches and family members -- were expected to descend upon Greensboro and generate an estimated $5 million in economic impact. Jon Jolley, the director of competitive swimming at the Hickory Foundation Y.M.C.A. in Hickory, N.C., outside Charlotte, knew how important the championship meets were for high school juniors trying to lower their times and make themselves more appealing to college recruiters. He also wanted to do something for high school seniors who would not be swimming in college. He tried to organize an alternate meet to the Y.M.C.A. nationals for Greensboro. It was met with decidedly mixed reviews. ""It was the spectrum -- I had lovers out there, I had haters out there,"" said Jolley, who has coached for 33 years. But as the week wore on, and as more and more professional and collegiate sporting events were nixed, ""we decided it just wasn't worth it,"" he said. Instead, his own club held what he called a mock meet on Friday and Saturday, to give swimmers a sense of finality. It wasn't easy, he said. ""I've got teenage girls crying,"" Jolley said. ""One of them said to me, 'This is the most depressing day of my life.' I said, 'All your hard work will pay off in the future.'""","Millions of children sit home as competitions go dark, though some are trying to play limited games.",ae1cbf2d-5e9a-5f79-b188-f30ca1e4e68f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/16/sports/16virus-youthsports-1/16virus-youthsports-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=2564aea81635a633701f3c9dab42f43409212401096fd2faf1ad4d7318edb80b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A high school basketball championship game was played without fans in Lake Charles, La., on Friday.",ae1cbf2d-5e9a-5f79-b188-f30ca1e4e68f,N24News/imgs/ae1cbf2d-5e9a-5f79-b188-f30ca1e4e68f.jpg,9
Theater,5 Must-See Shows if You're in New York This Month,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/theater/must-see-shows-if-youre-in-new-york-this-month.html,"Yes, it's August, in all its fire and fetor, and maybe you'd rather be at the beach. But new productions opening in New York this month offer consolation and stimulation (and essential air-conditioning) to those staying in the city. They include sharp-minded considerations of matters political, from Suzan-Lori Parks and the multifarious Michael Moore; an anthology of Broadway musical hits from a master of the genre, Harold Prince; and New York premieres from the empathetic Simon Stephens and the caustic Bruce Norris.

THE TERMS OF MY SURRENDER Michael Moore, who predicted the victory of our incumbent president, makes his Broadway debut to assess the consequences of that prophecy fulfilled in these not-so-United States. This polymathic documentary filmmaker (""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" ""Sicko"") and author (""Dude, Where's My Country?"") is turning the Belasco Theater into a one-man bully pulpit for his distinctive gospel of All-American dissent. This being New York City, he may be mostly preaching to the choir. But Mr. Moore tends to tripwire his own sermons in ways guaranteed to provoke thought, laughter and red-blooded rage. Michael Mayer (""Spring Awakening,"" ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"") directs.

PRINCE OF BROADWAY A colossus of the musical theater since the 1950s, Harold Prince returns to the Times Square neighborhood, where his name is a byword for both innovation and razzle-dazzle. This animated scrapbook of a Tony Award-laden career features numbers from the Olympian classics on which Mr. Prince served as a producer or director: ""West Side Story,"" ""Fiddler on the Roof,"" ""Cabaret,"" ""Follies"" and ""Sweeney Todd,"" for starters. As might be expected, Mr. Prince has assembled a caviar team for this Manhattan Theater Club production, including the choreographer Susan Stroman, who co-directed with Mr. Prince, and, as musical supervisor and arranger, the composer Jason Robert Brown.

A PARALLELOGRAM Who knows what evil -- and festering discontent and bad faith -- lurks in the hearts of men and women? Bruce Norris does. He's the corrosive dramatist who has regularly peered (and poked) under the rocks of American hypocrisy with plays like ""The Pain and the Itch"" and the Pulitzer Prize-winning ""Clybourne Park,"" which riffed -- without hope but with great wit and inventiveness -- on the watershed Lorraine Hansberry play, ""A Raisin in the Sun."" His ""A Parallelogram,"" directed by Michael Greif (""Dear Evan Hansen"") for Second Stage, follows one woman's dialogue between her present and future selves. A bright tomorrow is unlikely to be in the forecast. The cast includes Celia Keenan-Bolger, Anita Gillette and Stephen Kunken.

THE RED LETTER PLAYS In the late 20th century, the peerlessly intrepid dramatist Suzan-Lori Parks revisited Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter,"" that great 19th-century novel of Puritan guilt, to consider the stigmas with which African-American women have been branded. Ms. Parker has an expansive and thrillingly original imagination, and her riposte to ""The Scarlet Letter"" required two plays, both featuring a central character named for Hawthorne's ill-used Hester: ""In the Blood"" and ""A,"" whose full title includes an unprintable epithet. Now the Signature Theater Company is reviving these works in tandem, with new productions directed by Sarah Benson (""In the Blood"") and Jo Bonney (""A""). You are sure to be reminded that no one writes American history -- or rewrites its cultural cliches -- like Ms. Parks, who won a Pulitzer Prize for ""Topdog/Underdog.""

ON THE SHORE OF THE WIDE WORLD The British playwright Simon Stephens has become one of the theater's most poignant chroniclers of everyday lives in upheaval. Best known for his Tony-winning adaptation of Mark Haddon's ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,"" Mr. Stephens has also written a series of quieter, diamond-faceted dramas in which static existences are shaken and stirred into new forms, including the smashing two-character ""Heisenberg,"" seen on Broadway last season with Mary-Louise Parker and Denis Arndt. Now the Atlantic Theater Company, which gave us a fine production of Mr. Stephens's ""Harper Regan"" in 2012, presents the New York premiere of his ""On the Shore of the Wide World,"" a delicately drawn map of roads not taken by three generations of a family in Mr. Stephens's native Stockport, England.","Political plays by Suzan-Lori Parks and Michael Moore, Harold Prince's hit anthology and New York premieres from Simon Stephens and Bruce Norris.",2fdf1991-9688-597a-95f0-6f5083342801,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/01/theater/01mustsee-para/01mustsee-para-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=7ef7c9396bb6b99421bc9124582d19b018976372d7223aa653b28baf9f652375&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Celia Keenan-Bolger in ""A Parallelogram.""",2fdf1991-9688-597a-95f0-6f5083342801,N24News/imgs/2fdf1991-9688-597a-95f0-6f5083342801.jpg,10
Fashion & Style,A New Wrinkle in Logo Dressing,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/fashion/arkwear-polo-shirts.html,"Keep your swoosh and your polo players. Logos are a drag. If only, one sometimes feels, we could return to the days of well-made generics, clothes advertising nothing but their anonymous good quality.

Sure, there is Uniqlo and Topshop and H&M. Yet, inevitably, shopping at those international chains for anything resembling my beanpole body type leaves me feeling as if I ought to be trolling the aisles at Rochester Big & Tall. Thus, when spring rolls around, I face an annual quandary: where to find a proper summer sport shirt.

Frustratingly enamored of licentious T-shirts and polo shirts produced by Carne Bollente, an indie label founded by the French model and artist Felix Gesnouin and a band of his pals, I went hunting for one of its shirts featuring subtly embroidered logos of couples of every sexual stripe getting busy.

Real Estate,In Search of a Studio With Counter Space,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/realestate/studio-with-counter-space.html,"For Catherine Bazerghi, a Texas native, life in New York City began in 2011, with a roommate on the Lower East Side. ""It was such a rude awakening,"" she said. ""It was less than 500 square feet for a two-bedroom, and I came from a 950-square-foot one-bedroom in Dallas."" Ms. Bazerghi, who previously worked in retail and e-commerce and is now seeking a new position in e-commerce, later roomed with a friend in the Gramercy area and then moved into her sister's two-bedroom condominium in Hoboken, N.J. She paid $1,000 a month in rent and was able to save toward a studio of her own.

""I had fairly low expectations,"" she said, ""because I understood what I would be able to get with my price point,"" up to $350,000. She cared most about having a kitchen she could live with for a long time. If the kitchen didn't have more than a small wall of appliances, the layout would have to allow for a portable island. ""I wanted an oven that could fit a cookie sheet in it,"" she said.

She craved counter space, too, for her KitchenAid mixer, which was housed temporarily with her parents in Austin, Tex., until she had room for it. ""I love to be the person who brings treats to the office,"" said Ms. Bazerghi, who is the president of the New York chapter of Texas Exes, an alumni organization for the University of Texas at Austin.

Last fall, Ms. Bazerghi saw a nice-looking studio with a Murphy bed and a large, renovated kitchen on Realtor.com. The asking price was $349,000, with monthly maintenance of around $600. She contacted the agent, but didn't hear back. Her mother connected her with a longtime friend from Austin, James Malone, now an associate broker at Bond New York. He arranged a visit to the studio, in Concord Village in Downtown Brooklyn, a seven-building complex near the Brooklyn Bridge built around 1950. As she stepped inside the studio, she felt that it was made for her. ""I watch a lot of HGTV, and people write letters to the owners,"" she said. So she wrote hers: ""I would love to spend many future years in this apartment,"" she told the seller.

One studio, in a big building in Murray Hill, had an asking price of $365,000 and maintenance of almost $800. The kitchen was small, and the window faced the noisy exit lanes of the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. The studio later sold for around $367,000. Another studio, on the Upper East Side, had a brick wall, built-in bookshelves and a sunken living room. It was $295,000, with maintenance of $833.

""It was tiny, but had so much character, which I can be somewhat of a sucker for,"" Ms. Bazerghi said. But the kitchen had a convection oven instead of a regular one, and renovating felt like more than she could handle. The apartment later sold for $290,000. Having seen other options, Ms. Bazerghi felt certain about her choice in Brooklyn. Mr. Malone negotiated a price of $335,000. Ms. Bazerghi considered keeping the Murphy bed for guests, but decided to sell it on Craigslist. She added blue textured wallpaper to create what she called a ""wow wall,"" and arrived in the spring.","Finding a place in the city with a decent-size kitchen can be a challenge — but for a buyer who loves to bake, it was essential.",1006928f-32fd-54c2-a04b-01d77416f76d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/01/realestate/01hunt1/01hunt1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=06f2d18eddb7140e9ca6bec8d4e09dbbd3816b74549f99a5bbb6c60d01533287&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Catherine Bazerghi in her new studio apartment in Downtown Brooklyn.,1006928f-32fd-54c2-a04b-01d77416f76d,N24News/imgs/1006928f-32fd-54c2-a04b-01d77416f76d.jpg,7
Economy,Strong Exports Lift U.S. Agriculture Sector,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/01/business/economy/01exports.html,"Even as the broader economy falters amid signs of a weakening recovery, the nation's agriculture sector is going strong, bolstered in part by a surge in exports, according to federal estimates of farm trade and income released on Tuesday. The estimates confirm what economists have been saying for months: agriculture, which was generally not hit as hard by the recession as many other segments of the economy, remains a small bright spot going forward. ""We're just having a robust rebound in the agricultural sector and promises of more growth,"" Jason R. Henderson, vice president and economist at the Omaha branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, said in a recent interview. The estimates show that American farmers will ship $107.5 billion in agricultural products abroad in the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. That is the second-highest amount ever, behind the record $115.3 billion in exports logged in 2008, when commodity prices soared as the global demand for agricultural products was helped by fast-growing economies in the developing world.

Next year, exports are expected to total $113 billion. In releasing the data, Tom Vilsack, the secretary of agriculture, said exports of grains and meats were leading the rebound. He called the new estimates ""very encouraging."" The export growth is propelled by higher prices for many products, including wheat, whose prices have skyrocketed as drought and punishing heat decimated crops in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Exports to Asia have been particularly strong, and China is forecast to surpass Mexico next year to become the second-largest foreign buyer of American farm products. Canada is the No. 1 export market. Wheat exports this year are estimated at $6 billion, about the same as last year, as much of this year's crop had already been sold when prices started to rise. But wheat exports for the fiscal year 2011 are expected to rise to $8 billion, because of higher prices and increased production. Prices for other grains have risen, too, encouraging farmers. ""The better the demand, the higher the price, and it's going to put another 10, 15, possibly 20 cents in the price of a bushel of corn,"" said Bill Horan, a corn farmer in Iowa. Corn is about $4 a bushel, which is about 50 cents higher than last year. ""It means my wife can go out and buy a new sofa, and I can put new tires on the pickup."" Prices have also risen significantly for cotton, meat and dairy products. Cotton exports are expected to reach $6 billion next year, up from $4.8 billion this year and $3.5 billion last year, on the strength of a large crop here and tight worldwide supplies that have lifted prices.

Other economic measures were also promising for the farm sector, which accounts for a small fraction of the overall economy but has a strong impact on the well-being of many rural areas, and a ripple effect for suppliers and other related industries. Total net farm cash income for the current calendar year was estimated at $85 billion, a 23 percent increase from last year and well above the 10-year average of $72 billion. About 75 percent of farm production occurs on just 271,000 farms, or 12 percent of the total farms in the country. Those large commercial farms were forecast to average $220,000 in net cash income this year, a 22 percent rise from a year ago. When all farms are taken into account, average farm household income is expected to be $81,670 this year, a nearly 6 percent increase from last year. Household income for many who live on farms comes largely from off-farm jobs and other sources, like investments. This year, on average, 11 percent of the household income for farm families was predicted to come from agriculture.

Income from both farm and nonfarm sources is expected to rise this year, indicating an overall improvement in the rural economy, officials said. Joseph Glauber, the agriculture department's chief economist, said that a strong rebound in livestock and dairy prices had been a major factor in the farm recovery. Dairy producers were hurt badly in the recession by high costs and low prices, which have recently begun to recover. Cattle and hog producers also struggled with low prices, caused by overproduction. But cattle and hog producers have managed to cut the size of their herds, pushing prices back up at the same time that international demand recovers, Mr. Glauber said. ""Exports are kind of driving our market,"" said Jason Anderson, who operates a cattle feedlot in Holbrook, Neb. ""Demand is pretty good, and we've seen about a $5 to $7 price rally just this month,"" he said, referring to the price per hundredweight. Economists said that the farm sector overall was not hurt as badly in the recession because farmers generally had better access to credit. At the same time, farms over all were not highly leveraged, putting them in a better position to withstand the economic storm. ""The farm economy in rural America has not suffered as severely as the industrial part of the economy and, because of the strong exports, the rural economy is recovering what it lost during the downturn,"" said Roy Bardole, a farmer in Rippey, Iowa, and chairman of the Soybean Export Council.","The export growth is propelled by higher prices for many products, including wheat, whose prices have skyrocketed as drought and heat decimated crops in Russia.",6f4e4883-611c-55cf-a2a2-77d23d56661f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/01/business/01EXPORTS/01EXPORTS-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=330&w=600&s=9578e83ae405a02e6cfd31c281db3e18f5bc1788898316b532460621cb10d9e7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"T-bone steaks from the United States on sale in Seoul, South Korea.",6f4e4883-611c-55cf-a2a2-77d23d56661f,N24News/imgs/6f4e4883-611c-55cf-a2a2-77d23d56661f.jpg,8
Books,New Book Returns to an Irresistible Theme: the Harvard Murder,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/04/books/becky-cooper-we-keep-the-dead-close-harvard-murder.html,"A young archaeology graduate student at Harvard is bludgeoned to death by the professor with whom she's having an affair. The murder weapon is a stone tool from the university's Peabody Museum. Under cover of darkness, the professor steals into the museum with the woman's corpse and conducts a macabre funeral rite, draping her body in ancient jewelry and sprinkling it with red ocher powder. Harvard, determined to avoid bad publicity, thwarts a police investigation, protects the professor and silences the press. It's as if the murder never happened. This is the story Becky Cooper heard as a Harvard junior in 2009. It lodged in her mind and would not let go. Intuitively, she knew the details couldn't all be true, but the idea that her university was capable of covering up a murder did not strike her as far-fetched. ""The very things that made me love Harvard -- its seductiveness, its limitlessness -- also made it a very convincing villain,"" Cooper writes in ""We Keep the Dead Close: A Murder at Harvard and a Half Century of Silence,"" her book, 10 years in the making, about the case at the heart of the rumor. ""Harvard felt omnipotent.""

In this respect, ""We Keep the Dead Close"" is the latest entry in a rarefied genre: the Harvard murder. It's a literary category in which erudition, integrity and high-mindedness are pitted against unthinkable malevolence. There have been just a handful of killings associated with the university since its founding in 1636 -- an average of little more than one per century.

When one does occur, public reaction is intense. Foreign correspondents descend on Cambridge, Mass. Television cameras stake out Harvard Yard. And book deals ensue. The particulars vary, but with each case the scandal, and perhaps the thrill, is that such a paragon of excellence can be brought so low. It was the institution itself ""whose honor and virtue were really on trial,"" the historian Simon Schama writes in ""Dead Certainties"" (1991), his imaginative reconstruction of the 1849 murder of George Parkman, a Boston businessman, by John Webster, a former Harvard classmate and a professor at the medical school. Webster, who had fallen into debt and owed Parkman money, chopped his body into pieces, hiding his torso in a tea chest and throwing other parts down a medical-school privy, where they were eventually found -- ""bits of butcher's trash sitting on the wet dirt.""

Sixty thousand people swarmed the Boston courthouse where Webster's trial was held, including reporters from Germany and England. ""What was it that had magnetized them all?"" the sheriff in charge of managing the crowds wonders in Schama's book. ""The faintly disgusting excitement to be had from observing a man of the learned, moneyed classes revealed as a murdering beast?"" The sheriff was onto something. ""Harvard seems like Harry Potter world,"" Melanie Thernstrom, the author of ""Halfway Heaven: Diary of a Harvard Murder"" (1997), about a Harvard junior who in 1995 stabbed her roommate 45 times and then hanged herself in their shower, said in an interview.

""It's cloistered, it's ivy-covered, it has a mystery that other schools don't have,"" Thernstrom added. ""There is this sense of it being very much a secret society or a castle, where the drawbridge is up and the students inside are living this magical life. When one is murdered, it's like evil has penetrated the fortress. How could someone have the supposed virtues that admit them to the kingdom and also commit such an evil act?"" Even the 1991 slaying on a Cambridge street of Mary Joe Frug, a legal scholar only indirectly connected to Harvard (her husband taught at the law school), was molded to this story line. A year after Frug was stabbed to death by an unknown assailant, a pair of male law students at Harvard wrote a mocking sendup of the article on feminist legal theory that Frug had been working on before she died and which was published posthumously in the Harvard Law Review. The parody version, attributed to ""Mary Doe,"" the ""Rigor-Mortis Professor of Law,"" was laced with tasteless jokes and crude sexual innuendo. It quickly became national news: proof of something rotten at the heart of the Ivy League. Faculty and students denounced the parody, arguing that in its misogyny it constituted ""a perpetuation,"" in the words of one student, ""of the forces that killed Mary Joe Frug."" Harvard's role in the slaying at the center of ""We Keep the Dead Close"" also turns out to be more symbolic than literal. Cooper discovers that the lurid story about the young woman's death at the hands of her professor had been circulating on campus for years.

Over the course of her research, it became ""a gateway into this much larger story about abuses of power of the institution,"" she said in a phone interview. ""And it wasn't at all where I expected to go."" As her book opens, Cooper has graduated from Harvard but is back on campus. She sits in on a class taught by the professor rumored to have committed the crime. By now, she has uncovered the dead woman's name -- Jane Britton -- and pored over photographs of her from a dig in Iran. And she has combed through every press report about her killing, which remained unsolved. It occurred early on Jan. 7, 1969, the day Britton was supposed to take her general exams in archaeology. By the next day, it was front-page news, in some papers bumping reporting on Sirhan Sirhan's upcoming trial for the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy. Cooper listens, rapt, to the Harvard professor's lectures, sifting them for clues. (When the professor, describing an ancient Israeli site where people were buried under their houses, remarks, ""the dead are kept close to you,"" she jots down the line and circles it in her notebook -- surely, it's suspicious!) She painstakingly recreates Britton's life, tracking down her friends, her brother, her classmates, her boyfriend at the time and every still-living law enforcement officer who investigated her death. She acquires Britton's letters and journals. She files Freedom of Information Act requests with the C.I.A., F.B.I., Drug Enforcement Administration, State Department and Defense Department, as well as records requests with the police in Boston and Cambridge and the district attorney's offices in Middlesex and Suffolk Counties. She trawls Websleuths, a cold-case site. She even spends a month on a dig in Bulgaria, in emulation of her dead subject. ""We Keep the Dead Close"" swells with false leads and red herrings -- it's not much of a spoiler to reveal that the supposedly murderous professor turns out to be innocent of the crime. And here is where Cooper's book takes a novel, contemporary twist.","In ""We Keep the Dead Close,"" Becky Cooper explores a killing she heard rumors about when she was a student, at a school where such crimes have become a rarefied literary genre.",a652059b-d8a9-551c-9441-84bc25cdecdd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/06/books/04IVYCRIME1/04IVYCRIME1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=7168d77393a2aecab8e4ae7dbf025e77449657b7f280b3615af877ca34173b70&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Becky Cooper, the author of ""We Keep the Dead Close.""",a652059b-d8a9-551c-9441-84bc25cdecdd,N24News/imgs/a652059b-d8a9-551c-9441-84bc25cdecdd.jpg,13
Books,"In 'The Room Where It Happened,' John Bolton Dumps His Notes and Smites His Enemies",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/books/review-room-where-it-happened-john-bolton-memoir.html,"In June 2019, Iran had shot down an unmanned American drone, and Bolton, who has always championed what he proudly calls ""disproportionate response,"" pushed Trump to approve a series of military strikes in retaliation. You can sense Bolton's excitement when he describes going home ""at about 5:30"" for a change of clothes because he expected to be at the White House ""all night."" It's therefore an awful shock when Trump decided to call off the strikes at the very last minute, after learning they would kill as many as 150 people. ""Too many body bags,"" Trump told him. ""Not proportionate.""

Bolton still seems incensed at this unexpected display of caution and humanity on the part of Trump, deeming it ""the most irrational thing I ever witnessed any President do."" In the book, Bolton is vague about the targets themselves, though it was later reported that he wanted one of them to be the Iranian commander Qassim Suleimani, killed on Jan. 3 by American airstrikes, four months after Bolton left the administration. On Jan. 6, Bolton finally agreed to testify at the impeachment trial if the Republican-controlled Senate subpoenaed him -- which, as predicted, it never did.

As for what Bolton might have said at the trial, his chapter on Ukraine is weird, circuitous and generally confounding. It's full of his usual small-bore detail, but on the bigger, more pointed questions, the sentences get windy and conspicuously opaque. He confirms what Fiona Hill, a White House aide, recalled him saying to her when she testified at the House impeachment hearings (including his memorable comparison of Rudolph Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, to a ""hand grenade""). But Bolton declines to offer anything comparatively vivid in his own book, taking cover in what he depicts as his own bewilderment.

He recalls a meeting in the Oval Office during which Trump said he wanted Giuliani to meet with Ukraine's then President-elect Volodymyr Zelensky ""to discuss his country's investigation of either Hillary Clinton's efforts to influence the 2016 campaign or something having to do with Hunter Biden and the 2020 election, or maybe both."" Yet Bolton -- known for what a 2019 profile in The New Yorker called his ""tremendous powers of recall"" -- said it was too much for him to fully understand. ""In the various commentaries I heard on these subjects, they always seemed intermingled and confused, one reason I did not pay them much heed."" He resorts to making noises of concern about what he refers to as ""the Giuliani theories.""

In an epilogue, Bolton tries to have it multiple ways, saying that while he may have found Trump's conduct ""deeply disturbing,"" it was the Democratic-controlled House that was guilty of ""impeachment malpractice."" Instead of a ""comprehensive investigation,"" he sniffs, ""they seemed governed more by their own political imperatives to move swiftly to vote on articles of impeachment."" He says they should have broadened their inquiry to include Halkbank and ZTE, but then neglects to mention that nothing was stopping him from saying as much, or from testifying if he was so terribly concerned.

""Had I testified,"" Bolton intones, ""I am convinced, given the environment then existing because of the House's impeachment malpractice, that it would have made no significant difference in the Senate outcome."" It's a self-righteous and self-serving sort of fatalism that sounds remarkably similar to the explanation he gave years ago for preemptively signing up for the National Guard in 1970 and thereby avoiding service in Vietnam. ""Dying for your country was one thing,"" he wrote in his 2007 book ""Surrender Is Not an Option, ""but dying to gain territory that antiwar forces in Congress would simply return to the enemy seemed ludicrous to me.""

When it comes to Bolton's comments on impeachment, the clotted prose, the garbled argument and the sanctimonious defensiveness would seem to indicate some sort of ambivalence on his part -- a feeling that he doesn't seem to have very often. Or maybe it merely reflects an uncomfortable realization that he's stuck between two incompatible impulses: the desire to appear as courageous as those civil servants who bravely risked their careers to testify before the House; and the desire to appease his fellow Republicans, on whom his own fastidiously managed career most certainly depends. It's a strange experience reading a book that begins with repeated salvos about ""the intellectually lazy"" by an author who refuses to think through anything very hard himself.","In his memoir, the former national security adviser writes about Donald Trump's White House, including the president's attempts to ingratiate himself with Turkish and Chinese leaders.",2cf3126a-6896-5d1e-b1f1-3cdbd413c812,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/23/books/00Bolton1/00Bolton1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=4c637929c9484e00563a55d3670db8bc513f6f7fc20361d0294dfe9e9423d47c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"John Bolton, then national security adviser to President Trump, looks on as Trump speaks to the press at the White House on April 9, 2018.",2cf3126a-6896-5d1e-b1f1-3cdbd413c812,N24News/imgs/2cf3126a-6896-5d1e-b1f1-3cdbd413c812.jpg,13
Real Estate,"Insert a Gym, Then a Lounge: Older Buildings Add Amenities",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/24/realestate/older-buildings-add-amenities-to-compete.html,"When Donal Burke and his wife, Monica Goel, decided to leave their rental and buy an apartment a few years ago, they knew what they wanted: a newly built condominium. ""We like modern design, big windows and plenty of light, and new buildings tend to have those and they mostly have better amenities,"" said Mr. Burke, 54, a computer consultant. But after considering shiny new possibilities across Manhattan and in Brooklyn, the couple grabbed a one-bedroom co-op at the Carlton Regency, an apartment house on East 36th Street that was built in 1966. Major lures were the brand-new bike room and brand-new workout room, which the couple deemed equal to fitness areas in many of the just-born condos they had toured. ""And the building had the bonus of having a roof deck,"" Mr. Burke said. An even bigger bonus: The apartment was more spacious than its condo counterparts and about 25 percent cheaper, as co-ops tend to be.

Score one for the old kid on the block. The Carlton Regency is one of many residential buildings in New York rethinking, refurbishing or increasing their offerings in an effort to compete with the thousands of square feet in amenities indigenous to newly constructed buildings. For years, co-ops and a subset of older rentals were able to get by on their good looks, old world charm, pedigree and, maybe, a discreet gym or children's playroom in the basement. But the rich menu of amenities at the city's many freshly built condos and rentals -- swimming pools, game rooms, massage rooms, yoga rooms, music rooms, party rooms, conference rooms and pet spas -- has been a wake-up call and a call to arms for limestone dowagers.

""Everyone is trying to keep up,"" said Stan Olan, the president of the co-op board at Two East End Avenue, a century-old factory converted into apartments in 1979. ""I drive around the city every day, and I'm constantly seeing new buildings coming up with great amenities."" Sometimes, Mr. Olan doesn't have to drive far. Completing construction just up the street from him at 20 East End Avenue is a condo designed by Robert A. M. Stern Architects whose amenities will include a wine cellar, a fitness center, a sauna, a children's lounge, a billiards room and a library. It's probably no coincidence, then, that Mr. Olan and his fellow board members are giving serious thought to updating the two fitness rooms in the basement at Two East End -- last refreshed in 2013 -- and adding a rooftop deck in order to take full advantage of the building's water views. ""Residents will enjoy it,"" Mr. Olan said. ""But the other consideration is that we understand about amenities, and by spending some money, we'll increase our value."" When condos started going up in New York in the 1970s, ""they weren't the most upscale buildings and they weren't in the most desirable locations,"" said Eva C. Talel, a partner in the law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, and the head of its co-op and condominium practice. ""They weren't seen as threats to classic co-ops."" But the definition of desirable location has become quite elastic, and at the same time, ""many condos being built are top of the line -- with anything you could ask for in terms of amenities,"" Ms. Talel said. ""So, wisely, co-ops are now doing what they can do to maintain value and to attract the right kind of purchasers.""

At Trump Plaza, a co-op building on Third Avenue and 61st Street that was built in 1984, the basement workout facility is being turned into a children's playroom, and the fitness room, complete with new equipment, will relocate to what was the super's duplex apartment on the first and second floor of the building. ""We thought about a wine cellar and more storage space,"" said Marc Cooper, the president of the building's co-op board. ""And we thought about keeping the gym downstairs, but at the end of the day, we thought a gym with natural light would be value-enhancing."" The budget, he added, is ""a healthy six figures."" Mr. Cooper said it was ""incumbent on the building to maintain its competitive standing with new construction the best it can."" Five years ago, Julie S. Perlin, an associate broker at Stribling & Associates, the real estate firm, and a resident of the Carlton Regency, advised her co-op board that if the building had some amenities -- at the time, there were none -- it could more effectively hold its own with new construction. After a questionnaire revealed that a majority of the shareholders wanted a gym, a package room, a roof deck and a bike room, a capital campaign raised the necessary funds, between $4 million and $5 million. Included in the tab were a new roof and conversion from steam to gas. The amenities portion of the project was completed last summer. Before, apartments in the building ""were selling for $800 a square foot,"" Ms. Perlin said. ""Now, it's about $1,200 a square foot. Part of that is the rising market. But the amenities are playing a major role in getting people to come and look at the building."" Granted, the Carlton Regency is celebrating the big 5-0 this year. But when it comes to New York real estate, developments don't have to be old to be considered, well, old. A residential building is an ingenue for maybe three years. By the age of 8 or 9, some decide it's time to have some work done.

""We had to do it to keep up with 150 Charles Street and 160 Leroy,"" Mr. Sukenik said, referring to a pair of new high-end condos in the neighborhood. ""It's definitely kept us competitive. We're fetching north of $2,500 a square foot, and new construction is just under $3,000 a square foot."" Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel, agrees that amenities add value, but precisely how much is hard to say. ""The perception,"" Mr. Miller said, ""is that it's an a la carte thing: 'If I have a gym and I add a community room it adds X percent to the value, and if I add a sauna it adds Y percent.' But it doesn't work that way. It's more of a package."" But not all older buildings feel the need to play catch-up, Mr. Miller said. Some think they're plenty fine just the way they are, thank you very much. There are mid-block prewar co-ops on the Upper West Side and Upper East Side, for example, that ""have nothing more than the structural needs that make them a building,"" he said. ""They barely have a lobby, let alone a gym, and it may not be to their detriment. Layering on amenities like a wedding cake doesn't necessarily make any difference in how a building is received by the market."" As for rental buildings, some are feeling the same pressure and imperatives as older co-ops and condos. ""As much as people are looking for location and looking for a certain apartment layout and certain finishes, they want to know what else a building has to offer,"" said Mitch Gelberg, a senior managing director of the real estate firm Rose Associates. Until recently, London Terrace Gardens in the West 20s, a 1930 property in Rose's portfolio, had little to offer on the amenities scale, ""and all of our competition had amenities,"" said Amy Rose, a company president. In response, storage space and a warren of old offices were redeployed, and are now a glass-walled workout facility and a lounge with a Joe coffee outpost. ""You can learn from all the newer buildings,"" Ms. Rose added. ""We love to visit our colleagues' buildings and see what they're doing. But sometimes you're limited by the space you have, so you have to be creative."" For example, at 21 West Street, a 1931 building converted to apartments from offices in 1998, the children's playroom was created in an area previously given over to a staff locker room, Ms. Rose said.

""The design standards in those buildings were low,"" he said, ""so if you have a one-bedroom in a Yorkville building renting for $3,000 without amenities, a customer can go farther uptown and get the same product for less in a brand-new building, or go to Long Island City and pay just a little more for an amenities-rich new building."" In the end, the ""to thine own self be true"" rule applies. ""You have to look at it in the context of what your building is and maximize the assets you have,"" Mr. Miller said. ""If your building is 10 stories high and people want a high view, they're not going to come to you even if you do have a gym."" As Kathy Braddock, a managing director of William Raveis New York City, put it, ""The focus shouldn't be on competing with the new building across the street. It should be on competing in your own market segment. It should be about competing in your own weight class.""",Older co-op and rental buildings are working to keep up with the offerings in shiny new construction.,a2ffef41-7fda-5ded-992a-f194cc0a70a9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/24/realestate/24COV1-promo/24COV1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=deb88446ee9c8a55f013ebba65b190d29afb2edcff01e552f08080f7d73990cd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Donal Burke and his wife, Monica Goel, in the new bike room at the Carlton Regency, a 1966 co-op on East 36th Street.",a2ffef41-7fda-5ded-992a-f194cc0a70a9,N24News/imgs/a2ffef41-7fda-5ded-992a-f194cc0a70a9.jpg,7
Art & Design,Harry Potter E-Books Offer Hogwarts Lessons for All,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/arts/design/harry-potter-e-books-journey-through.html,"They will be perfect for the train or ""whatever Muggle transport you prefer,"" J.K. Rowling's Pottermore website predicts, announcing the coming publication of four new Harry Potter e-books.

The books, described as ""bitesize reads,"" will each be based on subjects studied at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, attended by Harry and his friends (and enemies). The series, titled ""Harry Potter: A Journey Through ..."" and illustrated by the London-based artist Rohan Daniel Eason, is, according to the website, inspired by and adapted from ""Harry Potter -- A History of Magic,"" the companion book to the 2017 British Library exhibition of the same name. Like that book, the e-books will feature manuscript pages, notes and sketches alongside the text.

[More about the Harry Potter exhibition, as it appeared in New York.]

The ""Journey Through"" books follow a number of short e-books already published under the title ""Pottermore Presents"" which collate and add to Ms. Rowling's writings and stories from the website, devoured by the huge fan base that has made the Harry Potter series one of the most lucrative publishing franchise in history, spawning two film series, a theme park, an app and a stage production now in three countries.

The first two books in the new series, to be published in English, French, Italian and German on June 27, and selling for $2.58 each, are ""Harry Potter: A Journey Through Charms and Defence Against the Dark Arts,"" and ""Harry Potter: A Journey Through Potions and Herbology."" The next pair, ""A Journey Through Divination and Astronomy"" and ""A Journey Through Care of Magical Creatures,"" are to arrive ""soon after.""","""Harry Potter: A Journey Through Charms and Defence Against the Dark Arts"" and ""A Journey Through Potions and Herbology"" are arriving in late June.",8f2dccf5-4300-5d77-93bf-dc61e82db5c2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/05/arts/31harrypotter-item/31harrypotter-item-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=2c9aa88e4e944cc19a65d1a05f352f13eda4d0eefc9f485546858df52b62efb6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"J.K.

Sports,"'Blatant Misogyny': U.S. Women Protest, and U.S. Soccer President Resigns",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/sports/soccer/uswnt-equal-pay.html,"Carlos Cordeiro, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, resigned Thursday night, three days after the federation argued in legal filings that ""indisputable science"" proved that the players on its World Cup-winning women's national team were inferior to men. Facing on-field protests by members of the women's team, withering criticism from major U.S. Soccer sponsors and public condemnation by members of the organization's board of directors, Cordeiro found his position untenable. ""My one and only mission has always been to do what is best for our Federation, and it has become clear to me that what is best right now is a new direction,"" he wrote in a statement announcing his resignation.

The arguments, made as the team and U.S. Soccer face an increasingly unbridgeable gap as they brace for a federal trial in May, infuriated the players, as well as at least three powerful U.S. Soccer board members. ""To see that blatant misogyny and sexism as the argument used against us is really disappointing,"" midfielder Megan Rapinoe said after her team's 3-1 win over Japan in the U.S. Soccer-organized SheBelieves Cup on Wednesday night. ""I know that we're in a contentious fight,"" she added in comments to reporters in Frisco, Texas, ""but that crossed a line completely."" Chris Ahrens, a former Paralympian, said he was ""deeply troubled, saddened and angry by the comments"" and had requested a meeting with U.S. Soccer's leadership and the members of the legal team.

Don Garber, the commissioner of Major League Soccer and a longtime U.S. Soccer board member, said in a statement that he expressed to Cordeiro ""how unacceptable and offensive I found the statements in that filing to be."" Cindy Parlow Cone, the vice president of U.S. Soccer and a former women's national team player, said on Thursday that she was ""hurt and saddened by the brief U.S.S.F. filed."" She added: ""I disavow the troubling statements."" Cone, 41, who was elected vice president last year, will take over for Cordeiro. She is the first woman to serve as U.S. Soccer's president. Rapinoe said the legal filings, made by some of the same lawyers who will face the players across the table in collective bargaining negotiations next year, had caused ""irreparable damage"" to the relationship between the team and U.S. Soccer. But they also appeared to damage important relationships between the federation and its sponsors. Coca-Cola, Volkswagen, Budweiser, Visa and Deloitte -- the presenting sponsor of the SheBelieves Cup -- all condemned U.S. Soccer for condoning the legal arguments. Volkswagen on Thursday declared itself ""disgusted"" by the positions taken. ""They are simply unacceptable,"" the company said in a statement, adding that ""we stand by the USWNT and the ideals they represent for the world.""

Notably, Nike, which paid the federation $22 million last year and is its biggest sponsor, did not comment on the filing. It was not the first time the equal pay fight had seen sponsors side with the team against the federation they pay. Last summer, Procter & Gamble urged the federation to be ""on the right side of history"" in the dispute, and donated more than $500,000 to the women's team's players association. Nike and Visa also said they supported the players at the time. The players made their own statement on Wednesday. Before the game against Japan, they came onto the field for pregame drills with their training tops turned inside out -- hiding the U.S. Soccer crest and leaving visible only the four stars representing the team's four World Cup triumphs.

""I think it was a powerful message, without having to really send a message,"" striker Carli Lloyd said after the victory, answering questions in front of a backdrop that featured the logos of Coca-Cola, Visa, Budweiser, Nike and other sponsors. She added: ""We don't want to be in this position, but we are here and it's just got to be better."" Before the night ended, the blank crest with the four stars was showing up in fans' social media avatars and on shirts that were licensed by the players' union. The filing, made late Monday night, opposed the women's team's motion for partial summary judgment in the equal pay lawsuit. In it, U.S. Soccer argued ""the job of MNT player carries more responsibility within U.S. Soccer than the job of WNT player,"" using the abbreviations for the men's and women's national teams, in regards to a claim under the equal pay act. They also argued the job of a men's team player ""requires a higher level of skill based on speed and strength.""","Legal filings in a lawsuit argued women's soccer players were inferior to men, poisoning an already testy relationship.

Food,"Ballpark Peanuts, a Classic Summer Pleasure, Have Been Benched",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/dining/peanuts-baseball.html,"Boston Red Sox fans love their peanuts, a snack that can last through nine agonizing innings at Fenway Park.



No hawkers, no piles of shells, empty stands -- and in the pandemic, no easy way to sell these snacks bred so carefully for the stadium.

Classic stadium food like garlic fries, Dippin' Dots and pump-cheese nachos are touchstones of something that feels heartbreakingly far away this summer: the thrill of being part of a huge crowd sharing a singular experience. Within the pantheon of concessions sidelined by the pandemic, ballpark peanuts stand out. Roasted in their shells and tossed into the stands with great ritual and panache, peanuts have been part of the national pastime for nearly 125 years. They have more cultural heft than hot dogs, and a more onerous coronavirus tale, too. Today, most of the 2.3 million pounds of in-shell peanuts consumed during a typical baseball season are languishing in cold storage, waiting -- like the fans -- for an opening day at the park that is unlikely to come. Baseball teams both minor and major are trying to find a way to schedule a season, but there will be no one in the stands to shell out $4 or $5 for a bag of peanuts.

""We are basically left holding the peanuts,"" said Tom Nolan, the vice president of sales and marketing for Hampton Farms, the North Carolina-based peanut and peanut butter company that roasts and packages most of the peanuts sold at baseball stadiums. The race is on to figure out what to do with all those special peanuts, which are expensive to grow and delicate to harvest. Only a certain peanut bred for the proper size and the look of its shell makes the cut for the ballpark trade. It's called the Virginia, grown in that state but also in the Carolinas, Texas and, to a lesser degree, New Mexico. (Only 14 percent of all the nation's peanut crop are Virginias. Most are runner peanuts, which are ground into peanut butter.) Of those big Virginias, about one-fifth end up at the ballpark. The rest are sold at grocery stores, gas stations and, at least before the pandemic, restaurants like the Five Guys hamburger chain, which handed them out free.

Peanuts began flirting with baseball in the 1890s, after Harry Stevens, an immigrant from Britain, moved to Ohio and fell in love with the game. He designed and sold its first scorecards. His slogan: ""You can't tell the players without a scorecard."" Here are more fascinating tales you can't help but read all the way to the end.
* None
* Getting Personal With Iman. The supermodel talks about life after David Bowie, their Catskills refuge and the perfume inspired by their love.
* A Resilient Team for a Broken Nation. With the Taliban in control, what, and whom, is Afghanistan's national soccer team playing for?
* The Fight of This Old Boxer's Life Was With His Own Family. A battle among   Marvin Stein's family over his fortune broke out, and he suddenly found himself powerless to fight for himself. A peanut company named Cavagnaros traded bags of peanuts for advertising space on the cards. Mr. Stevens then sold the peanuts to stadiums. A century later, in the 1990s, the little concession business he started with peanuts, hot dogs and scorecards was purchased by Aramark, which now supplies food to nine major-league ballparks, including about a million bags of peanuts each season. By the time Jack Norworth wrote the lyrics to ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"" as he rode the subway past the Polo Grounds in New York in 1908, the marriage between peanuts and baseball was sealed. Peanuts are a little more popular in the minor leagues, where about 8 percent of the 40 million spectators each season buy a bag. In the majors, it's closer to 6 percent, Mr. Nolan said. The difference is probably because it costs less to go to a minor league game and fans have more money for snacks, he said.

Fans might not think too much about how they look or the quality of their oil, but Dan Ward does. A farmer in Clarkton, N.C., he grows jumbo Virginias in the southeast corner of the state. They're not the easiest peanut to grow. The delicate shells crack more easily than the runners destined for peanut butter, so pulling them from the ground takes more time and patience. Growing them takes a special touch, too. ""You have to plant them in a loamy soil with enough sand, so the hull is bright,"" he said. ""I like for them to shine in the bag."" About 400 of the 1,650 acres he plants every year are given over to ballpark peanuts. Last year's crop -- the one sitting in storage at Hampton Farms right now -- was a particularly good one. ""Those peanuts should taste awesome,"" he said. ""When you do get a crop like that, you want people to enjoy them."" He had already sold that crop when the country began shutting down in March. But he didn't escape the effects of the shutdown. By late April, with the coronavirus turning agriculture on its head, he had to calculate how many ballpark peanuts to plant in May for the 2021 baseball season. He also grows corn and soybeans, so his peanut strategy depended in part on the volatile trade war with China and how much that country might buy. He had to figure in the price of other crops grown in his region and how the coronavirus would hit neighboring hog and poultry farmers, who buy some of his corn for feed. ""It is a wild picture,"" he said.

Meanwhile, the companies that bought those in-shell peanuts for what had been a robust baseball and restaurant market are trying to figure out what to do with them all. ""That's going to be a problem,"" said Bob Parker, the chief executive officer of the National Peanut Board. ""You can put them in cold storage for a while and hope things will resume, but it doesn't look so promising."" The peanut board is scrambling, plotting a round of promotions featuring free bags of in-shell peanuts that will remind armchair baseball fans that they don't need to wait to return to the stadium to crack some shells. Some grocery stores are planning promotions to move more bags of team-branded peanuts. There are other rays of hope. During the first months of the pandemic, raw in-shell peanuts started selling out at Walmart and other retailers. Mr. Nolan thinks some of the demand might have come from people who wanted to try roasting their own at home, and from others who have been creating backyard ""squirrel restaurants"" -- tiny picnic tables and bowls of raw shelled peanuts for squirrels. An even bigger boost came from homebound snackers. Retail sales for shelled Virginias were up nearly 15 percent in May over a year earlier, largely because people bought cans of them in March for what Mr. Parker called ""the initial pantry filling."" (""We don't like to say 'hoarding,' "" he said.)

Peanut butter sales are helping the industry overall, but it doesn't make sense to dump Virginias into the grinder. Because they cost more to produce, they need to sell at a premium, canned or in the shell, for the economics to work. Mr. Nolan is hopeful that what he calls ""the rising tide of all peanuts"" will carry his company until it figures out what to do with all those peanuts once destined for the ballparks. Or maybe baseball itself will come back. No one wants to think the unthinkable: that the handsome roasted baseball peanut, the one with a bright shell that cracks easily under gentle pressure from a fan's thumb, might have to end up in a peanut-butter jar. ""I would liken that to using a really fine beef tenderloin to make ground beef,"" Mr. Parker said. ""You can do it, and it would make great peanut butter, but it would be a great economic loss.""","No hawkers, no piles of shells, empty stands — and in the pandemic, no easy way to sell these snacks bred so carefully for the stadium.",107fd987-7227-5663-b6d2-dd9681f58eeb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/24/dining/23virus-peanuts4/merlin_173622078_73ae42fb-d257-462b-9349-8cd210e880de-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=cc9b75a1bbce3302fc454f33c0404f54384177f9c588347f03b6cbfe6092d088&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Special types of Virginia peanuts are grown for the quality of the nut and the shape of the shell.,107fd987-7227-5663-b6d2-dd9681f58eeb,N24News/imgs/107fd987-7227-5663-b6d2-dd9681f58eeb.jpg,17
Real Estate,A Summer Home in New York: Some Like It Hot,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/realestate/a-summer-home-in-new-york-some-like-it-hot.html,"By spending summers in her apartment on the Upper East Side, Marcie Chasen escapes the even hotter weather at home in Florida. Among her many pastimes: catching up with friends over a meal, going to shows on Broadway and dropping in on street fairs.

During the sweltering summer months, many affluent people flee Manhattan for the Berkshires, the Hamptons, the Jersey Shore -- anywhere they won't melt. After all, the city's busy streets and climbing skyline do not call to mind the traditional joys of summer: long, sunny days on the sand and in the surf, star-laden nights lighted by campfires and fireflies, the smells of freshly cut grass and slightly singed marshmallows. Yet while Manhattanites fight traffic to get out of the city, a rare breed of part-timer is breezing in from the other direction. In something of a reverse migration, these summertime city dwellers trade their retreats near the beach, lake or mountains for pieds-a-terre and long-term rentals in Manhattan, tolerating the heat, humidity and pungent warm-weather smells in exchange for a more laid-back New York. Here they find everything from open parking spots to prime tables at hot restaurants, as well as streets and parks brimming with outdoor events and plenty of air-conditioned museums and shops. Marcie Chasen, a former actress and singer from Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., who also owns a market research firm, has been summering in the city for the last decade. While escaping from Florida's soaring temperatures, she catches up with old friends and, these days, visits her son at Fordham Law School.

""Even though the weather gets hot here,"" she said, ""it's not the same as Florida."" As soon as the mercury begins to rise, Ms. Chasen, who is 58 and semiretired, closes up her 3,000-square-foot condo in Palm Beach Gardens and moves to a 600-square-foot one-bedroom on the Upper East Side. She bought the place in 2009 for about $500,000, after renting in the neighborhood for several summers. Except for a couple of weeks when she leaves town to visit her sister in Colorado, she remains here until September. ""I have a whole gang of friends,"" said Ms. Chasen, who lived in Manhattan for 27 years, mostly on the Upper East Side, before moving to Florida about 17 years ago. ""Now it's like all my peeps -- it's all Jewish women my age."" ""We go to rooftop bars all over the city,"" she added, rattling off some her favorite pastimes, like going to shows on Broadway and at Lincoln Center Out of Doors, shopping at street fairs, walking in Central Park and sitting in outdoor cafes. ""I love the whole ambience."" Millions of tourists visit Manhattan every summer for short vacations. ""It's the best time to be here because the locals are gone,"" said Kitt Garrett, the chief executive of Discover New York and Beyond, a travel specialist based in Manhattan. ""It's so much easier to get restaurant reservations and go through the museums with less people and enjoy a Broadway show. The traffic is less. I just dread September, when they all come back.""

""It's an entirely different experience,"" said Mr. DeSantis, who also has a waterfront condominium in the South Beach neighborhood of Miami, where he spends the winter, and a condo in Cleveland on Lake Erie, where he keeps a boat. ""Having your own place creates a different social dynamic."" In May he celebrated his 58th birthday by having 12 people over to his apartment for a dinner party. ""In a hotel,"" he said, ""it wouldn't be the same."" On a typical summer day, Mr. DeSantis, an avid cyclist, takes a long bike ride around the tip of Manhattan, or up the West Side Highway to the George Washington Bridge and back. He might catch a matinee on a Wednesday, which he notes is ""usually the easiest time to get good tickets for a reduced price via broadwaybox.com."" Or he'll grab a late-night burger and beer at the Shake Shack in Madison Square Park. ""If you get there around 10:30,"" he said, ""you'll avoid long lines, and sitting in their outdoor dining area is like being at a German beer garden."" If the heat becomes unbearable, Mr. DeSantis hops a flight to Cleveland to spend the weekend on his boat and visit family and friends. ""My door-to-door travel time is three hours,"" he said, ""about the same as most of the typical NYC region summer escapes."" Michelle Wendt, a writer and producer from Los Angeles, has transplanted her family to New York each summer for the past several years. For her, summering in the city is about reconnecting with a place she loves and exposing her children, Olivia, almost 15, and Leo, 7, to the East Coast vibe. The family was accustomed to spending Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve in Manhattan, but Ms. Wendt wanted to cultivate a stronger connection to the city than a holiday vacation allowed. ""It's not just about us having an extended vacation,"" said Ms. Wendt, who grew up in Connecticut and Shaker Heights, Ohio, and visited Manhattan often with her parents. ""My daughter and son are making real friendships there. They have New York pediatricians. I belong to a social club. We have New York play dates. It's really investing in having a whole New York life going on.""

Five years ago, they spent a couple of weeks at a friend's apartment in SoHo. The next year, they rented another friend's place in West New York, N.J., for a month, but found the commute cumbersome. The following summer, they paid about $6,000 a month for a short-term rental in the East Village, where they visited Japanese markets and various galleries. But they frequently headed uptown for the Public Theater's Free Shakespeare in the Park series, Lincoln Center's Midsummer Night Swing, and other family-oriented events. It wasn't until Edward F. Johnston III, a broker at Brown Harris Stevens and a good friend of Ms. Wendt's, said, ""Oh, just rent full time already,"" that they put down more permanent, albeit part-time, roots. The family is spending a second summer in a one-bedroom walk-up on the Upper East Side that they rent year-round for about $2,000 a month. ""Right now we have a great big bed and a pullout,"" said Ms. Wendt, who put about $20,000 into renovating the apartment to ensure it felt like home.

So, with little regret, she and Mr. Lenz rent out the 1940s Cape-style house during the peak summer months and remain in Manhattan with their two children. The rental income covers the mortgage for a few months, and they can take advantage of the quieter city for bike rides in the park, trips to museums and nights out listening to jazz. They begin visiting the Connecticut house again in the fall, when the summer crowds have subsided, the leaves change colors, the weather is cooler and the bug population has diminished.","While Manhattanites fight traffic to escape the city in summer, a rare breed of part-timer is breezing in from the other direction.",a16b3c45-e9aa-5802-a209-d610b77c49d2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/16/realestate/16COVER/16COVER-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2013&h=550&w=600&s=1d6a24660ab63e00dc359c7ab6d22342b6aa557b215bc2c9e96d7dcb4b49dcfd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"So where is everybody?

Your Money,"Vanguard, a Champion of Low Fees, Faces a Peculiar Tax Challenge",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/your-money/vanguard-a-champion-of-low-fees-faces-a-peculiar-tax-challenge.html,"Vanguard may have committed a sin while pursuing a virtue. Its virtue -- providing simple, diversified investments at very low cost -- is well known. Its sin -- if that's what it deserves to be called -- involves obscure details of tax accounting and corporate structure. It's not easy stuff. It's worth examining anyway. If a Vanguard whistle-blower is correct, Vanguard could end up owing the Internal Revenue Service a great deal of money, and millions of shareholders could end up paying somewhat higher fees. It seems most likely that even if Vanguard owes some money -- and it says it does not -- the outcome won't have a big impact on investors. Yet the dispute illuminates the unique structure and operations of a widely influential mutual fund company. First, consider Vanguard's virtues. Since John C. Bogle founded it in 1975, Vanguard has relentlessly cut costs for fund shareholders, offering simple index funds and ""at cost"" operations that have been a boon to millions of people, in the view of many academics and investment analysts. It did this with the help of an unusual corporate structure, which is at the root of the whistle-blower's tax complaint. Mutual fund shareholders, not a separate profit-making entity, are the ultimate owners of the Vanguard Group, which provides services to the individual funds, an arrangement approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. ""Vanguard was designed to eliminate conflicts of interest,"" said Tamar Frankel, a professor of law at Boston University. ""That structure was also one of the ways in which Jack Bogle reduced the cost for investors, and it's been an absolutely great thing.""

Vanguard's overall fees are the lowest in the industry, according to Morningstar. Its funds' average expense ratio is only 0.16 percent annually, compared with 1.16 percent for the industry. That 1 percentage point difference may not sound like much, but it is. One extra percentage point in annual fees compounded over a lifetime can shrink your retirement nest egg by 40 percent. That's the easy part of this story. The harder part is the claim that while providing at-cost services, Vanguard may have run afoul of some I.R.S. rules. That is what David Danon, a former Vanguard tax lawyer, says in whistle-blower claims against Vanguard filed with the I.R.S. and other authorities. The I.R.S. won't comment on the claims, and John Woerth, a spokesman for Vanguard, said, ""Vanguard believes they are without merit."" Mr. Danon and Reuven S. Avi-Yonah, a University of Michigan law professor who has served as Mr. Danon's paid expert, have some intriguing arguments, if you are partial to this sort of thing. The issue is technical, so bear with me: Mr. Danon says that because the Vanguard Group was set up as a ""C corporation,"" and not a partnership, it has potential tax liabilities, even if it does not actually earn a profit. And because it is owned by its mutual funds, for tax purposes, he says, it is required to account for the profits that it could have earned if it had charged the higher fees that the marketplace would have borne. This may sound like a through-the-looking-glass sort of world, where a company will be punished if it spares investors exorbitant fees, but it could conceivably be the world in which we actually live. ""This is a classic transfer-pricing issue,"" Professor Avi-Yonah says. ""The law is very clear."" Transfer-pricing tax problems typically come up when American corporations apportion income to their foreign subsidiaries to minimize domestic taxes. Professor Avi-Yonah is a prominent expert on this subject and has discussed it eloquently in congressional hearings. Companies like Apple, Microsoft, General Electric and Pfizer have been skillful practitioners of it. Sometimes such companies run afoul of the rules. In 2006, for example, GlaxoSmithKline reached a $3.4 billion settlement with the I.R.S. in what the agency then called the largest transfer-pricing dispute in its history.

On technical grounds, the I.R.S. ""could surely win in court"" if it applied transfer-pricing rules in the Vanguard case, Professor Avi-Yonah said. Not everyone is sure of that, though. David M. Schizer, a professor and dean emeritus at Columbia Law School, put the matter succinctly. ""The transfer-pricing rules are intended to capture economic reality and not distort it,"" he said, adding that they weren't intended to apply in a situation like this and result in taxes when no profit existed. ""I think it would be absurd to force Vanguard to pay taxes in this case,"" he said. And John D. Morley, a Yale law professor who is an expert on mutual fund structure, said, ""I consider this litigation a little silly."" Transfer-pricing rules are meant for situations in which a company controls a subsidiary and can use that control to set artificially low prices, thus concealing profits. That's not true here, Professor Morley said. ""As a practical matter,"" he said, ""all mutual funds are completely dominated by their manager. While Vanguard shareholders ultimately own the Vanguard Group, they don't really control it,"" he said. Vanguard charges low fees ""simply because that's the culture of Vanguard, as Jack Bogle created it,"" he said. ""It's a completely unique situation."" Even Professor Avi-Yonah acknowledged in an interview that applying transfer-pricing rules in the case of Vanguard ""seems startling."" In fact, he said he wasn't sure that the I.R.S. should enforce the rules in this fashion. ""Luckily, I don't have to make this decision,"" he said. ""God knows the I.R.S. has enormous discretion in these cases."" The agency ""could accept the taxpayer's argument that it was an innocent mistake,"" he continued, even if ""it involves an enormous amount of tax revenue."" Mr. Danon asserts that Vanguard could owe billions of dollars in taxes on the putative, uncollected revenue. ""I know that this is a very unpopular position, and that many, many people are shareholders of Vanguard funds,"" he said in an interview. ""But the law is the law. Like everybody else, Vanguard should pay the taxes it owes. If it doesn't, somebody else has to make up the difference, and that's just not fair."" Others have looked closely at the possible amounts involved. I'll return to the numbers shortly. But first, some conflict-of-interest disclosures: Professor Avi-Yonah has an obvious conflict. He says he received $10,000 to $50,000 from Mr. Danon for his research and legal opinion. But he also says that the money has not influenced his views and notes that he will collect nothing further if Mr. Danon's position prevails. Mr. Danon has a conflict: Now unemployed, he could receive a whistle-blower's bonus of up to 30 percent of any funds collected by the I.R.S. in the claim. But he says he is fighting for a principle: ""I felt I had to become a whistle-blower because I believe I'm right, and the law is the law, and I couldn't convince anyone at Vanguard about it.""

I have a conflict, too. Vanguard manages the retirement account at my workplace, as it does in many companies and institutions, and so I am a Vanguard shareholder. That's also true of several experts I contacted. Federal and state authorities have been considering these arguments. While the I.R.S. claim is pending, a New York judge dismissed Mr. Danon's suit in November, and Eric Soufer, a spokesman for the state attorney general, said on Wednesday that his office reviewed the case and has decided not to pursue it. Authorities in California declined to comment on a complaint filed by Mr. Danon there. He also has a claim with the S.E.C., which declined to comment. Mr. Danon has won one battle, however. The Texas comptroller of public accounts awarded him $117,000 for his role as a whistle-blower, said Lauren Willis, a spokeswoman for the agency. Reliable sources said Vanguard settled with the state for roughly $2 million, though the precise reasons for the settlement are not clear. Mr. Woerth of Vanguard wouldn't confirm the amount of the payment, and said it was merely the ""result of a routine audit."" It is possible that it arose from a relatively small part of Mr. Danon's complaint -- questions he has raised about the accounting for a $1.5 billion contingency fund that Vanguard maintains. Even if the I.R.S. finds Vanguard liable on all counts, the consequences are unlikely to be significant, says Daniel Hemel, a law professor at the University of Chicago (who, like me, is a Vanguard shareholder). He says that, with penalties, a Vanguard settlement with federal and state authorities could raise average annual mutual fund shareholder fees by no more than 0.09 percentage point, and probably less. Professor Avi-Yonah said he has reviewed Professor Hemel's calculations: ""I would rely on them."" Even with such an extreme outcome -- which seems highly unlikely -- Vanguard would remain the cheapest overall fund provider by a wide margin. In short, Vanguard is far from perfect. Mr. Danon appears to have some valid points and may win some further bonuses. And at the end of all this, shareholders would benefit if Vanguard ended up as an even more transparent company than it is right now. How much do top Vanguard executives earn, for example? If we shareholders really own Vanguard, it seems that we should know. I asked that question again last week and Mr. Woerth wouldn't say. But even without knowing the answer to that question or others raised by Mr. Danon, there seems to be no compelling reason for Vanguard shareholders to switch their investments to another company.","A whistle-blower claims that the mutual fund group, which is ultimately owned by investors in its funds, should have to account for profits it could have earned if it had charged higher fees.",fce5b389-a5f0-5b03-a8ed-56c36394bb8d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/07/business/07STRA/07STRA-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=0f33321a2a6b8fa6116ffac04fc117b3819e1c43f24dbd140fd3f84c53714c9d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"John C.

Media,"Apple Pulls Samuel L. Jackson Movie From Festival, Citing 'Concerns'",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/business/media/apple-afi-the-banker.html,"Apple canceled the premiere of ""The Banker,"" starring Samuel L. Jackson, on Wednesday, yanking the movie from its prestigious closing-night Thursday slot at the American Film Institute's annual festival in Los Angeles.

Apple, a newcomer to the entertainment business, acquired the movie in July and planned to put it in theaters nationwide Dec. 6 before making it available on the streaming service Apple TV Plus in January. AFI Fest's acceptance of the film, a civil-rights drama set in midcentury America, was a sign that it had Academy Awards potential.

""Last week some concerns surrounding the film were brought to our attention,"" Apple said in a statement on Wednesday. ""We, along with the filmmakers, need some time to look into these matters and determine the best next steps.""

""The Banker"" is based on the true story of Bernard Garrett and Joseph Morris, two African-American entrepreneurs who sought to financially empower black Americans by buying homes in white neighborhoods for them to rent and offering loans to black-owned businesses. Trying to get around discrimination by the banking establishment, they recruited a working-class white man as their frontman.","""The Banker,"" one of the tech giant's first forays into film, was a day away from its premiere at AFI Fest in Los Angeles.",5130dc3e-777f-5092-9e50-5114a02eb527,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/business/APPLEMOVIE2/APPLEMOVIE2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=154620f11b04fcd47daffa0bb424904b3d6b7c05f5b405f5d1c9feffa668a590&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Samuel L.

Travel,"At Sweden's Bungenas, a Wilderness Transformed",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/travel/on-a-swedish-island-a-wilderness-tamed.html,"The first thing you notice is the metal fence. At Bungenas, a remote peninsula of mostly untouched wilderness on the northeastern tip of Gotland, a Swedish island, arriving visitors must park their cars and continue on foot or on two wheels past the rusted gate -- a remnant of the area's past as a restricted military training facility. Peaceful and isolated, the Bergmanesque landscape has now been transformed into a dreamy natural playground for in-the-know Swedes. ""It was 'the last stand in Sweden,' they say, because if there was going to be nuclear war, this was going to be the place to be protected,"" said Joachim Kuylenstierna, a real estate developer who, envisioning a summertime utopia amid the site's abandoned bunkers and pine trees, bought the nearly 400-acre property in 2007. ""No public people have been allowed to visit this area since 1963, so nobody knew that it existed,"" he said. ""I thought that if I opened a coffee shop there, maybe someone would find it."" That coffee shop, which would later be called Nystroms, opened quietly in 2008 in a former commissary for workers of Bungenas Kalkbrott, a defunct limestone quarry that predated the military facilities. But finding an architecture firm to perform the renovations proved difficult, so Mr. Kuylenstierna started his own, Skalso Arkitekter.

Intentionally relying solely on word-of-mouth instead of advertising, Bungenas began to attract a trickle of day-trippers who had caught wind of an unusual cafe in the middle of nowhere. Still, Mr. Kuylenstierna used other barriers to maintain the area's mysterious aura. ""The idea was to keep the fence because I hate people who go and see nature in the car,"" he said. ""If you don't get out of the car, you can't smell the nature and you don't feel the nature."" The long-term plan was to build a community of unobtrusive well-designed summer homes, but Mr. Kuylenstierna first focused on a smaller project with the restaurateur Sonny Gustafsson. ""He asked me if I wanted to come see this beautiful place called Bungenas,"" Mr. Gustafsson said. ""And he showed me an old building that was totally worn down and shot to pieces from the military, and he said, 'I want to open a restaurant here, and I want you to do it.' ""

After a renovation, the World War II-era canteen opened as Bungenas Matsal in 2012. ""We took away the menus after the first night,"" said Mr. Gustafsson, who ran the waterfront restaurant that summer with only three staff members. The kitchen instead served a nightly multicourse menu to guests in one seating, creating a festive, familial atmosphere. And word soon got out that Bungenas also had a fine-dining restaurant worth traveling for.

""We made them walk or borrow the bikes to get down there,"" said Mr. Gustafsson, referring to a fleet of banged-up military bicycles parked inside the main gate that are free to use. (Walking the half-mile dirt trail from parking lot to restaurant through woods of pine and spruce is no hardship, either.) Surprised by the first season's success, Mr. Gustafsson recruited Johan Stromberg and his wife, Eva Toivonen (together the couple run the restaurant Bolaget in Visby, the main city on Gotland), to join the team. ""It was like nothing else I'd ever experienced, to come through this gate and come out to a place that is entirely untouched,"" Mr. Stromberg, a Gotland native, said of his first visit to Bungenas. ""The cars are gone and there are free-range sheep and this total harmony that I'd never found on Gotland before."" In 2013, the three opened a five-room hotel atop Bungenas Matsal, and turned Kalkladan, the old limestone storage barn, into a cavernous space for art exhibitions, music and other performances with its own bistro and bar. And last summer, Kalkladan hosted a concert series featuring top Swedish artists, which drew crowds of curious visitors to the old quarry site. Increasingly, Bungenas has surfaced on social media: photos of picnickers beneath the towering twin chimneys of the old limestone kilns, of cyclists dwarfed by jagged cliffs in the abandoned quarry, of sunbathers on metal military cots overlooking the Baltic Sea. This season, which will run until mid-August, the scene should be more tranquil with fewer concerts but more spontaneous events. A handful of residents will be around, since villas have now been built on 15 of the 152 lots. And a new 30-seat movie theater is set to screen the latest films.","The remote peninsula on the tip of Gotland has been transformed into a summertime playground, sporting a restaurant and a performance space.",7abc71bb-8a5d-5361-aa67-0cca511ff6bb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/28/travel/28HEADS1SUB/28HEADS1SUB-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=028f13ec6c229c732f201f1e71fb04ce507879c4aa89aa2e702b683b72367ade&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Nystroms, a coffee shop built in a former commissary for workers of Bungenas Kalkbrott, a defunct limestone quarry, by the Baltic Sea.",7abc71bb-8a5d-5361-aa67-0cca511ff6bb,N24News/imgs/7abc71bb-8a5d-5361-aa67-0cca511ff6bb.jpg,4

Theater,"'For Colored Girls' Returns, as a Celebration and as a Weapon",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/13/theater/for-colored-girls-returns-as-a-celebration-and-as-a-weapon.html,"Cast members from the original Broadway Production of ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf"" in 1977.





It doesn't matter how famous a play you've written, or how deeply embedded in the culture it's become. If you're a playwright, you're always going to be nudging someone about putting that show onstage again. So the last time they spoke, about a week before she died, the playwright and poet Ntozake Shange had a question for her director, Leah C. Gardiner. ""By the way,"" she asked, ""is there any movement on the production?"" She meant the Public Theater's revival of her breakthrough work, ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf,"" which starts previews on Oct. 8. Shange, who died last October at 70, envisioned the production as a celebration. It's also a homecoming of sorts, at the theater where this enduringly influential choreopoem opened to acclaim in 1976.

An ensemble piece, ""For Colored Girls"" is made up of thematically linked stories told in spoken poetry: bold, vivid, intimate tales of black female agency and adventure, danger and desire, sisterhood and sadness. Each of its seven roles is a woman named for a color of the rainbow, though Shange (whose full name is pronounced en-toh-ZAH-kee SHAHN-gay ) swapped out one standard hue, indigo, for a Lady in Brown. But it's her Lady in Yellow who delivers the crystallizing line. ""Bein' alive and bein' a woman and bein' colored is a metaphysical dilemma I haven't conquered yet,"" she says. The show has been part of the canon since it became a Broadway hit in 1976. Still, ""For Colored Girls"" doesn't get a lot of professional productions; it's been much more a staple of college theater. Many people, too, encounter it only on the page, in a text alive with references to music and movement. (See the opening credits of the new HBO series ""A Black Lady Sketch Show,"" where it is affectionately spoofed, with a puppet woman at the hair salon reading a puppet version of the play.)

But at a moment when race and gender are so prominent in the tumultuous civic dialogue -- and when black playwrights, particularly women, are pushing both the content and form of contemporary American drama in new directions -- the time seems right to revisit Shange's text. ""It's an absolute weapon, this play,"" said Ms. Gardiner, an Obie Award winner who last spring directed Tori Sampson's ""If Pretty Hurts Ugly Must Be a _________"" at Playwrights Horizons. ""It's a political weapon. But so are all plays.""

Ms. Gardiner said she didn't write poetry anymore herself, but she studied it at the University of Pennsylvania before getting an M.F.A. in directing from the Yale School of Drama in the 1990s. She also spent about nine months after college as a personal assistant to Shange. As Ms. Gardiner shapes ""For Colored Girls"" to her own vision, she's keeping in mind the curiosity that she said Shange felt about ""how the #MeToo movement has created space for reclamation of the 'black girl's song.'"" That's a phrase that the Lady in Brown speaks, but when Ms. Gardiner used it, she was talking of black women's ""self-ownership: owning our bodies, owning our hair, owning our skin."" Back in 1976, the play's cast at the Public and on Broadway included Shange as the Lady in Orange. Opening at the Booth Theater in the same season as the original productions of Neil Simon's ""California Suite,"" Stephen Schwartz's ""Godspell"" and David Mamet's ""American Buffalo,"" Oz Scott's production of ""For Colored Girls"" outlasted them all, running until July 1978.

""'For Colored Girls' was meant for women of color,"" Shange wrote in 2010, the year that Tyler Perry released his film adaptation. ""'For Colored Girls' still is a women's trip, and the connection we can make through it, with each other and for each other, is to empower us all."" Fittingly, the creative team for the new production will be made up entirely of women of color. Such a collaboration is a rare opportunity in the careers of Martha Redbone, who is composing the show's original music , and the choreographer Camille A. Brown (""Choir Boy""). ""I'm a musician and a woman of color, a woman in the music business,"" Ms. Redbone said over the phone, ""and you know how difficult that is. I work with an awful lot of guys."" Likewise for Ms. Brown: ""There are many times when I'm the only woman in the room,"" she said. ""Sometimes I'm the only black woman, sometimes the only black person. It depends on the day."" Both dated their earliest awareness of ""For Colored Girls"" to childhood. Ms. Redbone, who said her score would pay tribute to ""all the music of the African diaspora,"" had the poster for the play hanging in her bedroom in the 1980s -- a gift from her mother, who loved the show. Ms. Brown remembers a copy of that same poster, huge, on her uncle's wall. In its figure of a young black woman, she said, she saw someone who looked like her. The cover of the 1997 paperback edition of ""For Colored Girls."" ""I'm extremely terrified, because it is such a beloved show,"" Ms. Brown said, adding that she planned to draw on contemporary movement and forms of dance -- hip-hop, say, or the Harlem Shake -- that weren't part of its vocabulary decades ago.","Ntozake Shange's play, with its unflinching depiction of black women's experience, is coming back to the Public Theater more than 40 years after opening there.",3b45c575-351f-5304-abb1-cd3f251f3cae,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/15/arts/15NEW-COLOREDGIRLS/15NEW-COLOREDGIRLS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=14f798eca2923d3418245061b923689091d974cac373fc8154209d93ad6d9dd8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Cast members from the original Broadway Production of &ldquo;For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf&rdquo; in 1977.,3b45c575-351f-5304-abb1-cd3f251f3cae,N24News/imgs/3b45c575-351f-5304-abb1-cd3f251f3cae.jpg,10

Economy,"With Competition in Tatters, the Rip of Inequality Widens",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/13/business/economy/antitrust-competition-inequality.html,"The Justice Department is expected to rule soon on the biggest beer merger ever: a $100 billion-plus combination of Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller into a colossus that will reap some $3 out of every $10 spent on beer around the world. The prospect strikes fear into the hearts of myriad craft brewers in the United States that rely on Anheuser-Busch's distribution network, the biggest in the country. Will they get their double IPAs and Russian imperial stouts to market if the new leviathan shuts them off to bolster flagging sales of its own Bud and Pilsner Urquell? The stakes are higher than whether you will be able to find your favorite Belgian-style lambic at the corner store. The new merger amounts to another step in the long decline of competition in many American industries. It is a decline that stunts entrepreneurship, hinders workers' mobility and slows productivity growth. Slowing this trend has emerged as a tempting new avenue to address the plight of a beleaguered working class. Reviving flagging American competition might even help stop America's ever-widening inequality.

In April, President Obama issued an executive order calling on government agencies to look for ways to bolster competition in the industries they monitor. Hillary Clinton drew competition into the campaign trail, chastising dominant corporations for ""using their power to raise prices, limit choices for consumers, lower wages for workers and hold back competition from start-ups and small businesses."" And Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, made headlines last month when she called for antitrust agencies to crack down on Silicon Valley powers like Apple, Facebook and Google. Jason Furman, the chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, and Peter Orszag, former head of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, laid out some of the new thinking in a presentation last fall at Columbia University. Monopoly rents -- the excess returns a company reaps when it does not have to deal with pesky competitors keeping prices down -- could worsen inequality in a variety of ways. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate from Columbia University who served as top economic adviser to President Bill Clinton, has asserted that exorbitant corporate profits are being run up through oligopolies and passed along to stockholders, raising the share of national income accruing to the rich.

This may not fit snugly with the data, though. Notably, the rising share of income going to the top 1 percent is not driven mainly by overstuffed returns on investment but by the growing inequality in wages. Mr. Furman and Mr. Orszag suggest a different mechanism to fit this trend: Companies that reap monopoly rents are paying their workers more, sharing some of their rents with them. While that might sound a bit more egalitarian, it could be equally insidious. There is plenty of evidence that corporate concentration is on the rise. Mr. Furman and Mr. Orszag report that between 1997 and 2007 the market share of the 50 largest companies increased in three-fourths of the broad industry sectors followed by the census. In 1985 the top 10 banks had under 20 percent of banking assets. By 2010 they had more than half. Big Pharma too has become bigger, buying niche laboratories. So have hospitals: Between 2010 and 2014 there were 457 mergers in the hospital sector.

Studies have found increased concentration in agricultural businesses and wireless communications as well. And as Senator Warren observed, critical technology markets are often controlled by a single player. Among airlines, there are only four major United States carriers left. Not everybody buys the new analysis linking market power and inequality. ""This facile assumption that more antitrust means greater equality and wealth is just way overbroad,"" wrote Daniel Crane, an expert on antitrust law at the University of Michigan. Martin Gaynor, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and former chief economist at the Federal Trade Commission, noted that competition policy was about increasing the economy's efficiency, not changing the distribution of the spoils. ""I don't think antitrust is a major tool for addressing inequality,"" he told me.

How did the American economy get so concentrated? Technology surely helped. Tech giants like Google and Facebook benefit from economies of scale and network effects. It costs nothing to serve an additional search. Consumers will be drawn to the social media platforms that already have more users. Government watchdogs also messed up. Concerned only about local competition between bank branches, they allowed a huge nationwide concentration. ""Antitrusters stood by and sucked their thumbs while these mergers got through,"" Professor Scherer told me. Conditions imposed on troublesome mergers -- like orders to sell assets or to refrain from certain behaviors -- were mostly ineffective, Professor Kwoka said. How to fix it? Professor Kwoka suggests that when a given industry is already fairly concentrated, any future merger should be presumed to be anticompetitive, taking the burden of proof off the regulator's shoulders and putting the onus on the merging companies to prove it is not. Regulations also offer a promising tool: How about demanding that the Food and Drug Administration approve generic drugs more quickly? But what might help most is not some narrow change in the procedures to examine business combinations but a broadening of the objectives of competition policy. Antitrust economists might hate this idea, but perhaps it's time to broaden the discussion beyond how a decline in competition may hurt consumers, and to consider things other than narrow economic efficiency. That would include the way market concentration affects the distribution of the fruits of economic growth. It's not just about the price of beer.","The decline in competition in many American industries costs more than just rising prices. It stunts entrepreneurship, hinders workers' mobility and wages, and slows productivity.",9528537d-93f1-5191-88eb-69bd565b802f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/17/business/13PORTER/13PORTER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=2d3c385d3afbb59573cc7f911f66d4165cebf76c566729c7dc363ba2412b30b3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A worker pulls a pallet of Miller Lite at a Peoria, Ill., warehouse.

Art & Design,Making Art When 'Lockdown' Means Prison,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/arts/design/marking-time-review-moma-ps1.html,"A detail of a collage by Tameca Cole, ""All Locked in a Dark Calm,"" 2016, from ""Marking Time: Art in the Age of Mass Incarceration"" at MoMA PS1, a show of art made largely by inmates of the U.S. prison system.Credit...Karsten Moran for The New York Times



A detail of a collage by Tameca Cole, ""All Locked in a Dark Calm,"" 2016, from ""Marking Time: Art in the Age of Mass Incarceration"" at MoMA PS1, a show of art made largely by inmates of the U.S. prison system.

We're living in a post-fact time, but that doesn't mean there are no facts. Here are some. The United States has the largest population of captive human beings on earth, around 2.4 million, and an outsized percentage of them are Black. Since the 1980s, prison life sentences have quadrupled; the minimum age for imprisonment has dropped; the use of solitary confinement, sometimes referred to as ""no-touch torture,"" has grown. The result is the prison-industrial complex we know, a punitive universe walled off from the larger world. What takes place behind those walls? Deprivation and cruelty, but also the production of art, as we learn from ""Marking Time: Art in the Age of Mass Incarceration,"" a stirring 44-artist show at the reopened MoMA PS1. A beta version of the show appeared in 2018 at the Aperture Foundation in Manhattan, organized by Nicole R. Fleetwood, a professor of American studies and art history at Rutgers University. Dr. Fleetwood is also guest curator of the MoMA PS 1 exhibition and author of a lucid new book that provides the show's title and defines what she calls ""carceral aesthetics,"" an art shaped by radically constricted space, an untethered institutional time and material scarcity.

How he managed to hide the piece, which is in the show, and then spirit it out of the prison, I don't know. But the challenges can't have been as great as those faced by another Fairton inmate, Jesse Krimes, who had the task of preserving a much larger work of his own. Mr. Krimes had just graduated from college with an art degree in 2008 when he was arrested and sentenced to jail on a drug offense. (With few exceptions, Dr. Fleetwood steers clear of mentioning the specific reasons the artists in the show were incarcerated, presumably to avoid having their art read through the lens of criminality.) He quickly came to understand how psychologically damaging the prison environment could be, and knew that only a focus on art-making would save his sanity.

From this realization came what turned out to be a carceral magnum opus: a cinematically scaled, labor intensive heaven-and-hell landscape composed of images culled from newspapers, fashion glossies and art magazines, with all the images transfer-printed -- using hair gel as a medium -- onto more than three dozen prison-issued bedsheets. With the help of fellow inmates and cooperative guards, he was able, over three years, to mail the sheets, one at a time, out to friends. It was only after his release in 2014 that he got to see the panels united as a single work measuring 15 feet tall and 40 feet wide. He called it ""Apokaluptein 16389067,"" combining the Greek verb ""to reveal"" and his prison number. No less ambitious in scale, though executed in much smaller increments, is a room-filling piece by Mark Loughney, who is in prison in Pennsylvania. Titled ""Pyrrhic Defeat: A Visual Study of Mass Incarceration,"" it's a wraparound floor-to-ceiling installation of some 500 head-shot-style drawings of the artist's prison mates. In the most recent depictions, done after the beginning of the pandemic, the sitters wear face masks.

There are many self-depictions in the show. An imposing one by Russell Craig -- a self-taught artist who, since his release from Graterford State Prison, has painted public murals in his native Philadelphia -- is nine-feet tall and fills a gallery wall. Another, called ""Locked in a Dark Calm"" by Tameca Cole, is standard printer paper size. Made in reaction to an incident of jail mistreatment, it's a collage of a fragmented female face emerging from, or sinking into, a sea of densely scribbled graphic lines. And an exquisite pencil self-portrait by Billy Sell (1976-2013) feels as personal as a signature. Serving a life sentence in a California prison for attempted murder, and kept in isolation there, Mr. Sell died while participating in a statewide prison hunger strike protesting solitary confinement. Prison officials called his death a suicide, though the cause has since been questioned.

Mr. Sell is one of several artists in the show involved in political activism while incarcerated. Another is Ojure Lutalo, arrested in 1975 while robbing a bank to gain funds for a Black revolutionary group. He spent much of his 22 years in isolation units where he produced hundreds of text-intensive collages protesting institutional racism. He is straightforward in calling his work ""visual propaganda,"" though not all the political art in the show is as bluntly instrumental. In an outstanding contribution, James ""Yaya"" Hough -- sentenced, at 17, to life without parole for murder, and released after 27 years in 2019 -- fills two gallery walls with fantastically nightmarish line drawings of figures that shape-shift between male and female, punisher and punished.

In the end, the exhibition -- which Dr. Fleetwood organized with the curators Amy Rosenblum-Martin, Jocelyn Miller and Josephine Graf -- complicates the definition of crime itself, expanding it beyond the courtroom into American society. It's a society in which racism often determines presumption of guilt; in which imprisonment -- human disempowerment and erasure -- is chosen over righting the inequities that lead to prison. It's a society in which caging people is big corporate business, with connections reaching everywhere, including the art world. This was made clear in recent protests targeting museum trustees -- Tom Gores, the private equity investor, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, and Larry Fink, chairman and chief executive of BlackRock, at MoMA -- for their investments in the prison-industrial complex. The scales of justice are sensitive and shifting. The only way to rightly balance them is with a steady, passionate eye and a judicious touch, and that's where art itself comes in.

Well,Teaching Teens to See Eating as Part of the Natural World,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/well/eat/teaching-teens-to-see-eating-as-part-of-the-natural-world.html,"A cacophony of slapping noises filled the food lab at the High School for Environmental Studies in Manhattan one afternoon in late October. ""Think of all the hands that have done this for thousands of years,"" said Andrew Margon, an English teacher, as his students energetically pummeled lumps of corn masa into tortillas. The students were taking a cooking class as part of Food Ed., an interdisciplinary curriculum developed by the Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture, a nonprofit farm and educational center based near Tarrytown, N.Y., which also has a partner high-end restaurant. The course offers students a whirlwind tour of how food gets grown, marketed and consumed. Food Ed., which was introduced five years ago into a handful of schools in the New York area, is now offered as an elective in 37 high schools nationwide. Additional schools are planning to start the program soon. ""We don't aim to change the way students eat in line with a particular dietary prescription,"" said Lindsey Dayton, the senior manager of the Food Ed. program. ""We want to help them think critically about the way nutrition intersects with culture as well as the environment and farming. We want our students to understand how eating makes them a part of the natural world and not separate from it.""

""When I look at my plate now,"" said Marco Ricci, 16, one of Mr. Margon's students, ""I think about the effort that goes into it, the dirt and all the nutrients it needs in the soil. It's amazing that this salad in front of you is made of so many different things grown in so many different places in so many different ways.""

Students are also learning about the plight of farm workers who are exposed to toxic agricultural chemicals and about the millions of people in the United States who are undernourished or don't have access to healthy food in their communities. As part of a unit on food waste, Mr. Margon's class will gather donations of ""seconds,"" slightly flawed or outdated produce, from farmers' markets around the city and use it to prepare lunch for 100 homeless New Yorkers at the end of the school year in June. ""There are lots of school garden programs, mostly in elementary schools. And there are also some great food courses in colleges,"" said Danielle Nierenberg, the president of the nonprofit group Food Tank, which calls itself ""a think tank about food."" But food is no longer routinely taught as a separate subject to high schoolers, she said.

""We are educating kids to pass tests; we're not educating them to live healthy lives,"" Ms. Nierenberg said. Abby Franks teaches Food Ed. at Morey FlexTech, a high school in Shepherd, Mich., set in the middle of corn and soy fields. Ms. Franks is also concerned about the impact of fast food culture on her students. But it's not enough for them to simply rethink their personal diets. She also wants students to scrutinize the industrial agricultural system that surrounds them. ""If they are eating a burger, I hope they'll ask, 'I wonder how this cow was treated, what impact did it have on the environment, what is my own imprint on the world,'"" Ms. Franks said. ""I want them to move beyond passively consuming and to become thoughtful about the food they eat."" Her class is currently evaluating the pros and cons of an industrial pig operation that will be opening in their town. Ms. Franks is revising the ambitious sample menus that Stone Barns provides to focus on less exotic foods like tacos that are familiar to her students. But the students' palates are hardly timid: They cooked up some culinary-grade insects as part of a lesson on ""taboo foods."" Those who tried them preferred fried meal worms, which resembled crispy McDonald's fries, Ms. Franks reported, over flying ants, whose acidic sourness turned out to be an acquired taste. Veronica Lopez, a science teacher at Cesar E. Chavez Learning Academies in San Fernando, Calif., who was trained in the Food Ed. curriculum at Stone Barns last July, helped her class make sopes de chapulines, a kind of grasshopper tostada with beans and vegetables, a traditional delicacy in southern Mexico.

Ms. Lopez decided to teach a special theme about corn, given its historical importance in Mexico and Central America, where many of her students' families come from. She called Ms. Dayton at Stone Barns for advice. ""We talked about how corn has been maligned, and students are hearing that corn is bad, it isn't healthy,"" Ms. Dayton said. She advised Ms. Lopez to focus on corn's traditional role and nutritional value as a whole grain. ""When they are making connections with plants, with food and with nature, it builds relationships, relationships between them and what they are eating,"" Ms. Lopez said. ""When you have a relationship with your food, you just naturally want to put things that are healthier inside yourself."" For Mr. Margon's class, the highlight of the semester was a field trip on a sunny Friday in November to Stone Barns, a 400-acre agricultural complex with pigs, cows and turkeys, as well as experimental growing areas where new crop varieties are tested. In addition to preparing a traditional Salvadoran meal entirely from ingredients produced on the Stone Barns farm and feeding the Red Wattle cross pigs with the leftovers, the students nibbled their way through a walking tour of the property sampling wild sassafras root, kale and other produce.","A curriculum called ""Food Ed."" encourages high school students to think about the way nutrition intersects with culture, the environment and farming.",c9bea908-850a-561c-8db8-bd336a26cdf9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/03/well/00well-fooded/00well-fooded-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=83dee6538de6a150373febf9c9e63f9730168edec21b0a31ae74df116692d127&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Students from the High School for Environmental Studies make pumpkin dessert as part of a food curriculum field trip at the Stone Barns Center for Food & Agriculture near Tarrytown, N.Y.",c9bea908-850a-561c-8db8-bd336a26cdf9,N24News/imgs/c9bea908-850a-561c-8db8-bd336a26cdf9.jpg,18
Books,September's Book Club Pick: The Upheaval in the American Workplace,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/books/review/beaten-down-worked-up-steven-greenhouse.html,"The book is full of high-stakes episodes in which the right decision is not clear. The ""powerful sword"" of the strike gets special attention throughout. In the 1970s, there were nearly 300 large strikes -- comprising at least 1,000 workers -- every year. After Reagan, that number plummeted to under 60. From 2008 to 2018, the average number was just 13.

The 1936-37 General Motors sit-down strikes by the United Automobile Workers, which led to the unionization of the auto industry -- and widespread unionization across other sectors -- get a heart-pounding chapter, where union leadership is constantly struggling with its own membership, the membership itself is divided and public opinion shifts perilously. At one of many critical moments, a change in wind literally changes the outcome of an encounter with the police: Tear gas directed at strikers and their supporters flies back, forcing a police retreat. The G.M. workers' spirits go up and down, they make strategies that work better than planned and others that are foiled altogether. There are several times when it looks as if they will fail entirely, and could be killed doing so.

Just because history is not foreordained does not mean it is random, however. One powerful lesson of the U.A.W. sit-down is the importance of radical vision and the bravery of a few workers; another is that elected and appointed officials can make a huge difference in private labor disputes. At one point, Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins yells over the phone at the head of G.M.: ""You are a scoundrel and a skunk, Mr. Sloan! ... You don't deserve to be counted among decent men! ... You have betrayed the men who work for you."" Alfred Sloan apparently retorted: ""You can't talk like that to me! I'm worth $70 million, and I made it all myself!""

With the breaking of the air traffic controllers' strike in 1981, the Reagan years are generally understood as the tipping point in labor history. It would be tempting to write about that strike through the lens of Reagan's ideology alone or, alternatively, to blame the strikers for their defeat. But Greenhouse gives the events leading up to the strike the respect and context they deserve, making it possible even for a reader who knows exactly how it turns out to hope that things might go differently, because the world from inside the minds of the strikers seems so coherent.

Great nonfiction requires great characters, and Greenhouse has the gift of portraiture. He is able to draw a complex, human portrait of a worker with a minimum of words, making the reader greedy for more details, not just about the policies but about the people. And he has both the newspaper writer's ability to find the one or two individuals whose personal stories exemplify a larger point, and the historian's ability to make what has already happened seem unlikely. He is skilled at homing in on the moments of the highest uncertainty, and transforming them into stories with quick and destabilizing twists and turns.

Greenhouse may be a great advocate for unions, but he has no patience for union insiders who have grown used to internal power and external weakness, who ask for too little and focus too much attention on strategies designed to minimize damage. George Meany, the longtime head of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., comes in for special scorn, standing for insular, uninspired, bureaucratic leadership. Meany once said: ""I used to worry about the membership, about the size of membership. But quite a few years ago I just stopped worrying about it, because to me it doesn't make any difference."" He added, ""Why should we worry about organizing people who do not appear to want to be organized?"" Union officials during the 1970s may not have been as direct, but they had the same view, and it showed up in their spending: While in the 1930s, unions spent over half their money on organizing, in the 1970s, many unions spent under 5 percent.

But Greenhouse's greatest anger is for the large companies -- and their Wall Street owners -- that have no human connection to the workplace and that are pushing the limits with new tactics to demoralize workers and strip them of their power and dignity. When a unionization flier was found in a Walmart bathroom, the company sent in a SWAT team the next day to nip empowerment in the bud. Companies also buy up the airwaves: In 2017, Boeing ran 485 television ads aimed at 3,000 workers during a unionization drive.","Steven Greenhouse's ""Beaten Down, Worked Up"" traces the modern history of American workers and their current condition.",f4151720-3737-5561-b857-3c659a81e200,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/13/books/review/13Teachout/13Teachout-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=9db161445bc71af43ade91e0907a9ae1d51df9878b1cff802d840b0e543f54a9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Supporters of Fight for $15 rally in Detroit, July 30, 2019.",f4151720-3737-5561-b857-3c659a81e200,N24News/imgs/f4151720-3737-5561-b857-3c659a81e200.jpg,13
Science,Yearly 9/11 Tribute Shows Light Pollution's Effects on Birds,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/science/september-11-tribute-lights-birds.html,"Researchers from Cornell and the New York City Audubon Society have been monitoring the memorial, which consists of two pillars of 44 spotlights aimed directly upward to simulate the fallen Twin Towers, since it was first presented in 2002. In 2008, the team began using radar and acoustic sensors to track how many birds the light was attracting and how it affected their behavior.

In 2010, the beams attracted so many birds that the researchers convinced the memorial's operators to turn off the lights for 20 minute intervals, which presented ""a unique opportunity"" to study ""behavior in birds when these incredibly powerful lights were on versus when they were off,"" said Dr. Farnsworth. The lights were briefly extinguished again in 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016.

Compiling data from seven nonconsecutive years, the researchers found that bird density near the installation was 20 times greater than surrounding areas, causing sometimes fatal collisions with structures and other birds. Alterations to the birds' migratory paths also put them at risk of death and starvation from arriving late to their destinations.

All such behaviors ceased within minutes of the lights being turned off. The installation affected more than 1.1 million birds cumulatively in those seven years, the researchers said.",Scientists used the annual memorial to the fallen Twin Towers to quantify the effects of urban nighttime light on migratory birds.,92e935b2-f26a-5368-a8f1-4aebe18830f7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/10/science/03TB-LIGHTS/03TB-LIGHTS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=675579916615484a8abc7567c21b4d7215e7b8ef09612149546da7aa20d3c211&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A study quantified the effects on birds when the September 11 ""Tribute in Light's"" beams are switched on.",92e935b2-f26a-5368-a8f1-4aebe18830f7,N24News/imgs/92e935b2-f26a-5368-a8f1-4aebe18830f7.jpg,2
Theater,"Holiday Cheer, Spiked or Straight",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/15/theater/taylor-mac-meet-me-in-st-louis.html,"Taylor Mac's autumn-harvest headdress is such an elaborate landscape of apples and gourds that the gleaming green talons reaching out of it come across as a subtle touch. Beneath it, the makeup is mesmerizing: an almost trompe l'oeil tribute to the 16th-century painter Giuseppe Arcimboldo, who depicted people with vegetables where facial features would otherwise be. And the set, in the opening tableau of Mac's ""Holiday Sauce ... Pandemic!,"" is such a tinselly tumult of color that even the performer's shimmery costume, bedecked with blossoms and slit up to here, blends right in, as if it were extravagant camouflage. The look, then, is the first shiny lure of this mature-audiences-only entertainment, whose writer and star has brought a bevy of talent to refashion for streaming the annual live show ""Holiday Sauce"" -- including, indispensably, the set and costume designer Machine Dazzle and the makeup designer Anastasia Durasova.

Which this bawdy, spangled, queer celebration absolutely does -- when it's not busy looking like a glamorous concert recording, or a trippy music video, or a cheeky animation, or a cinematic home movie of some of the people in Mac's chosen family. There are catwalk-dramatic costumes and gorgeous guest stars, with familiar carols and original songs interspersed, irreverently. For stage artists like Mac -- and, at a different spot on the continuum, Irish Repertory Theater, about whose ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" more in a bit -- the fundamental challenge of 2020 has been to reconfigure their work for an audience that isn't physically present. It can be an awkward undertaking, even more so at this tradition-encrusted time of year.

Directed by Jeremy Lydic, with large segments sumptuously filmed by Robert Kolodny inside the Park Avenue Armory, this companion to Mac's new album ""Holiday Sauce"" is by turns homey and sleek -- though the band, with its string and horn sections, sounds consistently warm and lush. (The music director and arranger is Matt Ray.) Its high-low aesthetic feels just right, not only as a reflection of an erratic year but also as an encapsulation of Mac's career, which in recent years has vaulted from the downtown alt fringes into prestige territory. Produced by Pomegranate Arts, the show was commissioned by the Ibsen Festival, the Norwegian Ministry of Culture and the National Theater of Oslo. (Saturday's three showings followed the virtual ceremony for the International Ibsen Award, which Mac won this year.) As smashing as both Mac and the Armory look, one of the most captivating segments is the video of the song ""Christmas With Grandma,"" whose lyrics about traumatic childhood holidays feel more bluntly grim on the album than they do with Dana Lyn's resilient and cheery felt-tip animations -- among them a Mac-faced ornament. (A masked Lyn also plays violin in the ""Holiday Sauce"" band.) But the unexpected show stealer is a glittering green Christmas tree that totters and spins through the Armory on precarious heels, arms out for balance and self-expression. We first glimpse it from afar, tiny and comical at the bottom of our screens, entering stage right in a follow spot. With Machine Dazzle inhabiting this magnificent costume, it is an evergreen at once winsome and gallant -- an endearingly bumbling, perseverant emblem of this weird, uncertain, sometimes defiantly festive season.

A similarly intrepid spirit pervades Irish Rep's ""Meet Me in St. Louis,"" an experiment in fully staging a musical online: costumes, sets, orchestra and all. Directed by Charlotte Moore, the 13 actors filmed themselves separately from home, their footage edited together later. I wish I could say it was a great success, and if you close your eyes, this stage version of the classic 1944 film can sound that way. (The book is by Hugh Wheeler, the score by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane.) The songs are often a delight, with a cast featuring expert interpreters like Melissa Errico -- as Anna Smith, the matriarch of a Missouri family eagerly awaiting the 1904 World's Fair in their hometown -- and lovely newcomers like Shereen Ahmed in the Judy Garland role of her teenage daughter, Esther. It is hard, though, to get past the jarring visuals, which have such a high-definition green-screen aesthetic that I'm sorry to say I kept wishing I could watch through gauze. With uncredited narration by Moore, who also adapted the script (and played Anna in the 1989 Broadway premiere), the show has an inherently nostalgic tone, whisking the audience back to the turn of the 20th century -- such a technological distance from our era that the Smiths' housekeeper, Katie (Kathy Fitzgerald), disapprovingly refers to the telephone as ""an invention.""

Health,Action Films May Spur the Need to Feed,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/health/action-films-may-spur-the-need-to-feed.html,"Action films may get the heart racing, but they may expand your waistline, a new study suggests.

Previous research has shown that people tend to eat more if they are watching television. But scientists from Cornell University wanted to know whether the type of programming made a difference. To find out, they gave snacks to 97 undergraduate students and split them into three groups. The first group watched a loud, frenetic clip from ""The Island,"" a 2005 action movie directed by Michael Bay. The second watched part of a Charlie Rose interview program on PBS. The third group watched the same excerpt from ""The Island"" as the first group, but without sound.

The first group consumed the most by far -- 65 percent more calories than the ""Charlie Rose"" group (354 calories versus 215) and 98 percent more food (7.3 ounces versus 3.7). The group that watched ""The Island"" on mute ate 46 percent more calories (315) and 36 percent more food (five ounces) than the Rose group.

""We choose this particular movie for its pacing,"" said Aner Tal, a research associate at Cornell's Food and Brand Lab and the study's lead author. He added, ""It could be that the camera cuts and sound set the tempo for the pace at which people eat.""","A study suggests that what you watch on TV affects how much you eat.

Travel,"River Cruising, Family-Style",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/10/travel/river-cruising-family-style.html,"While onboard entertainment is the focus of enormous ocean-faring ships, river cruises in Europe emphasize onshore activities -- one major reason that families (recommended for ages 8 and up) are hopping aboard.

""River cruises are all about destination immersion,"" said JD Lasica, the chief executive of Cruiseable, a consumer travel publication and booking site. ""The attraction centers on the activities along your route. It's a great way to broaden your children's horizons.""

In 2017, Uniworld's Jewish heritage themed Rhine-Main Discovery trip, for example, will be tailored for families. In addition to regular programming (including visits to Nuremberg's Nazi Party Rally Grounds and the former Rothschild palace turned Jewish Museum in Frankfurt) the trip incorporates hands-on experiences for young passengers, including a visit to a medieval crime museum in Rothenburg, Germany, and a torch-led tour of the underground passageways in Nuremberg.

This year, AMA Waterways introduced Adventures by Disney River Cruises on two newly built ships with connecting cabins, a first for river cruises.

Health,Vast Dragnet Targets Theft of Biomedical Secrets for China,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/health/china-nih-scientists.html,"The scientist at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston was hardly discreet. ""Here is the bones and meet of what you want,"" he wrote in a misspelled email to researchers in China. Attached was a confidential research proposal, according to administrators at the center. The scientist had access to the document only because he had been asked to review it for the National Institutes of Health -- and the center had examined his email because federal officials had asked them to investigate him. The N.I.H. and the F.B.I. have begun a vast effort to root out scientists who they say are stealing biomedical research for other countries from institutions across the United States. Almost all of the incidents they uncovered and that are under investigation involve scientists of Chinese descent, including naturalized American citizens, allegedly stealing for China. S eventy-one institutions, including many of the most prestigious medical schools in the United States, are now investigating 180 individual cases involving potential theft of intellectual property. The cases began after t he N.I.H., prompted by information provided by the F.B.I., sent 18,000 letters last year urging administrators who oversee government grants to be vigilant .

So far, the N.I.H. has referred 24 cases in which there may be evidence of criminal activity to the inspector general's office of the Department of Health and Human Services , which may turn over the cases for criminal prosecution. ""It seems to be hitting every discipline in biomedical research,"" said Dr. Michael Lauer, deputy director for extramural research at the N.I.H. The investigations have fanned fears that China is exploiting the relative openness of the American scientific system to engage in wholesale economic espionage. At the same time, the scale of the dragnet has sent a tremor through the ranks of biomedical researchers, some of whom say ethnic Chinese scientists are being unfairly targeted for scrutiny as Washington's geopolitical competition with Beijing intensifies. ""You could take a dart board with medical colleges with significant research programs and, as far as I can tell, you'd have a 50-50 chance of hitting a school with an active case,"" said Dr. Ross McKinney Jr., chief scientific officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges. The alleged theft involves not military secrets, but scientific ideas, designs, devices, data and methods that may lead to profitable new treatments or diagnostic tools. Some researchers under investigation have obtained patents in China on work funded by the United States government and owned by American institutions, the N.I.H. said. Others are suspected of setting up labs in China that secretly duplicated American research, according to government officials and university administrators.

The N.I.H. has not named most of the scientists under investigation, citing due process , and neither have most of the institutions involved . ""As with any personnel matter, we typically do not share names or details of affected individuals,"" said Brette Peyton, a spokeswoman at M.D. Anderson. But roughly a dozen scientists are known to have resigned or been fired from universities and research centers across the United States so far. Some have declined to discuss the allegations against them; others have denied any wrongdoing. In several cases, scientists supported by the N.I.H. or other federal agencies are accused of accepting funding from the Chinese government in violation of N.I.H. rules. Some have said that they did not know the arrangements had to be disclosed or were forbidden .

"" They next thing you know, they are being charged with wire fraud with 20-year penalties,"" he added. ""It's like, are you kidding me?"" The investigations have left Chinese and Chinese-American academics feeling ""that they will be targeted and that they are at risk,"" said Frank Wu, a law professor at the University of California Hastings School of the Law and former president of the Committee of 100, an organization of prominent Chinese-Americans. Dr. Wu and other critics said the cases recalled the government's five-year investigation of Wen Ho Lee, a scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory who was accused in 1999 of stealing nuclear warhead plans for China and incarcerated for months, only to be freed after the government's case essentially collapsed. He pleaded guilty to a single felony count of mishandling secrets. More recently, the Justice Department has been forced to drop theft charges against at least four Chinese-American scientists since 2014: two former Eli Lilly scientists in Indiana, a National Weather Service hydrologist in Ohio and a professor at Temple University in Philadelphia. The Justice Department changed its rules in 2016, giving greater oversight over these national security cases to prosecutors in Washington. But Dr. Lauer and other officials said the investigations into biomedical research have uncovered clear evidence of wrongdoing. In one case at M.D. Anderson, a scientist who had packed a suitcase with computer hard drives containing research data was stopped at the airport on the way to China, Dr. Lauer and officials at the center said. Overall, they argued, the cases paint a disturbing picture of economic espionage in which the Chinese government has been taking advantage of a biomedical research system in the United States built on trust and the free exchange of ideas. ""How would you feel if you were a U.S. scientist sending your best idea to the government in a grant application, and someone ended up doing your project in China?"" Dr. McKinney asked.

Concern at the N.I.H. about the theft of biomedical research stretches back at least to June 2016, when the F.B.I. contacted N.I.H. officials with unusual questions about the American scientific research system. How did peer review happen? What sort of controls were in place? ""They needed to know how our system worked as compared to, say, national defense,"" Dr. Lauer said. The F.B.I. declined to discuss ongoing investigations, including why it initiated so many and how targets were selected. But Christopher Wray, director of the F.B.I., told the Senate Judiciary Committee in July that China is using ""nontraditional collectors"" of intelligence, and is attempting to ""steal their way up the economic ladder at our expense."" The F.B.I.'s field office for commercial counterespionage, in Houston, asked administrators from Texas academic and medical centers to attend classified meetings in the summer of 2018 to discuss evidence of intellectual property theft. The administrators were given emergency security clearances and told to sign nondisclosure agreements. Then, acting on information from the F.B.I. and other sources, the N.I.H. in late August 2018 began sending letters to medical centers nationwide asking administrators to investigate individual scientists. ""This was something we had never seen,"" Dr. Lauer said. ""It took us a while to grasp the seriousness of the problem.""

Administrators at M.D. Anderson said three of the scientists had resigned and one had retired. The fifth case involved a scientist whose transgressions may not be serious enough to be fired. Dr. Xifeng Wu, who left M.D. Anderson and is now dean of the School of Public Health at Zhejiang University in China, declined to comment on the circumstances of her resignation. ""I would like to focus on my research,"" she said. A torrent of hate and violence against people of Asian descent around the United States began last spring, in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.
* None
* Background: Community leaders say the bigotry was fueled by President Donald J. Trump, who frequently used racist language like ""Chinese virus"" to refer to the coronavirus.
* Data: The New York Times, using media reports from across the country to capture a sense of the rising tide of anti-Asian bias, found more than 110 episodes since March 2020 in which there was clear evidence of race-based hate.
* Underreported Hate Crimes: The tally may be only a sliver of the violence and harassment given the general undercounting of hate crimes, but the broad survey captures the episodes of violence across the country that grew in number amid Mr. Trump's comments.
* In New York: A wave of xenophobia and violence has been compounded by the economic fallout of the pandemic, which has dealt a severe blow to New York's Asian-American communities. Many community leaders say racist assaults are being overlooked by the authorities.
* What Happened in Atlanta: Eight people, including six women of Asian descent, were killed in shootings at massage parlors in Atlanta on March 16. A Georgia prosecutor said that the Atlanta-area spa shootings were hate crimes, and that she would pursue the death penalty against the suspect, who has been charged with murder. M.D. Anderson is not the only institution wrestling with possible scientific misconduct. Last month, two married scientists, Yu Zhou, 49, and Li Chen, 46, who had worked at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, for a decade, were indicted on charges that they stole technology developed at the hospital and used it to apply for Chinese patents and set up biotech companies in China and the United States. Dr. Zhou's lawyer, Glenn Seiden, said in an email that the couple did not commit any crimes, and that Dr. Zhou is a ""trailblazer"" in scientific research. In May, two scientists at Emory University in Atlanta, Dr. Li Xiao-Jiang and Dr. Li Shihua, were fired after administrators discovered that Dr. Li Xiao-Jiang had received funding from China's Thousand Talents Program . The couple had worked there for more than two decades, researching Huntington's disease. University administrators declined to provide further information. ""They treated us like criminals,"" Dr. Li Xiao-Jiang said in an interview near Jinan University in southern China, where he and his wife now work. He disputed the suggestion that they had failed to report ties to China.

Federal and academic officials stress that they are not targeting Chinese researchers on the basis of their ethnicity. But the F.B.I.'s silence regarding how so many investigations began has exacerbated concern that the government's efforts to uncover economic espionage may tar all Chinese and Chinese-American scientists -- and make it more difficult to recruit Chinese students and scholars. ""We can't tell who is guilty or innocent, but look at the actual effect on people of Chinese descent,"" said Mr. Wu, the law professor. ""People are living in fear. It is a question of impact rather than intent."" With the Trump administration taking a harder line against China, including imposing tariffs intended to punish violations of intellectual property rights, Mr. Wu sees a sharp reversal in attitudes about China and the Chinese. ""I am getting calls and emails constantly now from ethnic Chinese -- even those who are U.S. citizens -- who feel threatened,"" he said. But few are willing to step forward with allegations of discrimination, he added. To Dr. Lauer, the charges of racism are unfounded. ""Not all the foreign influence cases involve China,"" he said. ""But the vast majority do."" The real question, he added, is how to preserve the open exchange of scientific ideas in the face of growing security concerns. At M.D. Anderson, administrators are tightening controls to make data less freely available .

People can no longer use personal laptops on the wireless network. The center has barred the use of flash drives and disabled USB ports. And all of its employees' computers can now be monitored remotely. The N.I.H. is clamping down, too. It recommends that reviewers of grant applications have limited ability to download or print them. Those traveling to certain regions should use loaner computers, it says, and academic institutions should be alert to frequent foreign travel by scientists, or frequent publishing with colleagues outside the United States. The National Science Foundation has commissioned an independent scientific advisory group to recommend ways of balancing openness and security, and warned employees that they are prohibited from participating in programs like China's Thousand Talents Program . The F.B.I. has given research institutions tools to scan emails for keywords in Mandarin that might tip off administrators to breaches, according to Dr. McKinney. ""The effects this will have on long-term, trusting relationships are hard for us to face,"" he said. ""We just are not used to systematic cheating.""",Nearly 200 investigations are underway at major academic centers.

Science,"NASA Delays James Webb Telescope Launch Date, Again",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/science/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-delay.html,"After years of budget overruns, testing problems and political difficulties, NASA's next great telescope has been delayed again, the space agency announced Thursday. The James Webb Space Telescope, which was proceeding toward a launch date of March 2021, will now be launched no sooner than Oct. 31, 2021. In a news conference Thursday, NASA officials blamed the delay on disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic and on schedule reviews that started last winter. ""Mission success is critical, but team safety is our highest priority,"" said Stephen Jurczyk, NASA's associate administrator. NASA said the delay would not add to the project's overall cost, which was capped at $8.8 billion by Congress a few years ago, because the program had reserves in its budget. ""Based on current projections, the program expects to complete the remaining work within the new schedule without requiring additional funds,"" said Gregory Robinson, the program director for Webb at NASA. Nor would it impact the ability of the Webb telescope to work with the Hubble Space Telescope, which the agency says will now last into the 2030s.

The telescope, named after James Webb, who led the space agency in the 1960s, is the long-awaited successor to Hubble. ""Webb is designed to build upon the incredible legacies of the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes by observing the infrared universe and exploring every phase of cosmic history,"" said Eric Smith, Webb's program scientist. Seven times larger than the Hubble in light-gathering ability, the Webb was designed to see farther out in space and deeper into the past of the universe. It may solve mysteries about how and when the first stars and galaxies emerged some 13 billion years ago in the smoky aftermath of the Big Bang. The telescope's main mirror is 6.5 meters in diameter, or just over 21 feet, compared with 2.4 meters for the Hubble. Its mission is to explore a realm of cosmic history stretching from about 150 million to one billion years after time began -- known as the reionization epoch, when bright and violent new stars and the searing radiation from quasars were burning away a gloomy fog of hydrogen gas that prevailed at the end of the Big Bang. Astronomers theorize that during that epoch, an initial generation of stars made purely of hydrogen and helium -- the elements created during the Big Bang -- burned ferociously and exploded apocalyptically, jump-starting the seeding of the cosmos with progressively more diverse materials. But nobody has ever seen any so-called Population 3 stars, as those first stars are known. They don't exist in the modern universe. Astronomers have to hunt them in the dim past. That ambition requires the Webb to be tuned to a different kind of light than our eyes or the Hubble can see. Because the expansion of the cosmos is rushing those earliest stars and galaxies away from us so fast, their light is ""red-shifted"" to longer wavelengths, the way the siren from an ambulance shifts to a lower register as it passes by.

So blue light from an infant galaxy bursting with bright spanking new stars way back then has been stretched, by the time it reaches us 13 billion years later, to invisible infrared wavelengths, or heat radiation which Webb is equipped to detect. It also turns out that infrared emanations are the best way to study exoplanets, the worlds beyond our own solar system that have been discovered in the thousands by observatories in space and on the ground since the Webb telescope was conceived. In order to see those infrared colors, however, the telescope has to be very cold -- less than 45 degrees Fahrenheit above absolute zero -- so that its own heat does not swamp the heat from outer space. Once in space, the telescope will unfold an umbrella the size of a tennis court to keep the sun off it. The telescope, marooned in permanent shade a million miles beyond the moon, will experience an infinite cold soak. The sun shield consists of five thin, kite-shaped layers of a material called Kapton. Much too big to fit into a rocket, the shield, as well as the telescope mirror, will have be launched folded up, and testing the shield on Earth has proved devilishly difficult. It will then be unfolded in space over six months in a series of 180 maneuvers that look in computer animations like a cross between a parachute opening and a swimming pool cover going into place. Or at least that is the plan. That whole process will amount to what the engineers call ""six months of high anxiety."" In space, nobody will be there with a wrench to help. Which means it will be a long nervous wait for the next set of cosmic baby pictures.",The universe will have to wait a little longer.,09fa9402-dd96-5c9b-bc05-09e93a83301c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/16/science/16SCI-WEBB1/16SCI-WEBB1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=00d7f956f915e25e8e60ba999291216db24e6ccb22ee66603687d952628e121b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Technicians at work on the mirror of the James Webb Space Telescope at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., in 2017.",09fa9402-dd96-5c9b-bc05-09e93a83301c,N24News/imgs/09fa9402-dd96-5c9b-bc05-09e93a83301c.jpg,2
Music,He Turned the Met Museum's Collection Into an Orchestra,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/arts/music/met-museum-oliver-beer-vessel-orchestra.html,"Oliver Beer's new work is the first sound-based installation to be commissioned by the museum.



Walking up the stairs of the Met Breuer last week, the British artist Oliver Beer pressed his face into a corner and began singing a slow succession of descending pitches. When he landed on a B flat, the walls suddenly vibrated with sympathetic resonance. It's the same thing that Mr. Beer, 33, has done hundreds of times at the Met over the past few years, but with objects from its collection -- vases, pots and sculptures, some of them thousands of years old -- rather than the building itself. He carefully tested these objects in search of the so-called ""natural pitches"" already present within them because of their geometric properties. The interior of a painted earthenware vase by Joan Miro, for example, resonates as a low F.

""I was able to listen first,"" Mr. Beer said in an interview, ""and then, very gently, to sing to one side, without my breath going near."" By tuning his voice to the resonance of the individual objects -- as he did with the Met Breuer's stairwell -- he was able to confirm the pitch each one was best able to ""sing.""

He ended up with an ensemble of 32 objects, which together form ""Vessel Orchestra,"" currently on view -- and audible -- through Aug. 11, the first sound-based installation to be commissioned by the museum. Linked, by microphones, to a nearby keyboard that's designed to trigger each individual object (and, therefore, frequency), the array, when properly amplified, is capable of producing the 32 sequential pitches of a well-tempered keyboard. In other words, thanks to Mr. Beer's intervention, musicians can ""play"" the whole setup, like a traditional piano. Don't fear for the Met's possessions; they are not actually struck or directly manipulated. The microphones are carefully suspended above each object, dropping down into openings and crevices without coming into direct contact with the artworks. When a key on the keyboard is pressed, it turns on the microphone in the corresponding vessel, producing what Mr. Beer calls ""the live feedback loop of the object."" Then the collection of tones played at any given time is amplified over speakers. During most of the museum's visiting hours, ""Vessel Orchestra"" plays a 20-minute piece composed by Mr. Beer on loop; the notes he has chosen, and his methods of pianistic attack, are already programmed into the keyboard. The resulting tones coming from the objects are amplified, live, as you listen: While it may be a disembodied performance, it isn't canned or prerecorded. (The effect is something like that of a player piano.)

This piece features nimbly flowing moments in which the microphones elicit delicate passagework, as well as drones dominated by clashing dissonances or hypnotic, sustained chords. On some afternoons, you might catch Mr. Beer or one of his colleagues giving a pop-up performance at the keyboard. And on Friday evenings, there are formal concerts, in which other musicians are invited to make use of the installation. ""My starting point was to interrogate both myself and my collaborators about the earliest fragments of music that they have in their minds,"" Mr. Beer said. ""It's almost inevitably from a mother or father or a grandmother."" His own memory is of the Scottish version of ""Black Is the Color of My True Love's Hair,"" which factors into the composition that plays on loop at the Met.

Last Friday evening, the Lebanese indie-rock group Mashrou' Leila gave a 40-minute show in the installation alongside the writer Rabih Alameddine. They responded to Mr. Beer's memory prompt by starting out with a sample of the popular tune ""Ya Garat Al Wadi,"" as performed by the Lebanese singer Nour El Houda in the 1960s. The performance began with the vocal sample, presented without alteration. Gradually, the members began to use Auto-Tune on El Houda's voice, in between versions of the group's own songs. These songs were in turn arranged to work alongside Mr. Beer's orchestra -- with the keyboardist Firas Abou Fakher often employing the low G that emits from the Met's ceramic 7th-century B.C. human-form vessel, excavated from Iran.

""One of the things that I personally loved most about Oliver's approach is the idea that these objects -- with all their troubled history, and all the bizarre stories that they tell -- are, in one way or another, harmonized,"" Mr. Abou Fakher said in an interview after the performance.","Oliver Beer's ""Vessel Orchestra"" includes 32 objects, ancient to modern, chosen for the sounds hidden within them.",f4015714-a2d5-5c57-9ca0-8d123c9498f1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/17/arts/16VESSEL-ORCH-4/16VESSEL-ORCH-4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=7dfd70f7d65cdaa64013641fd22b47845cd53bd22f5fec41613cd46823a1f0d7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The playable installation includes vases, pots and sculptures (by Joan Mir&oacute; and others) chosen for their natural pitches.",f4015714-a2d5-5c57-9ca0-8d123c9498f1,N24News/imgs/f4015714-a2d5-5c57-9ca0-8d123c9498f1.jpg,12
Economy,An Aging Society Changes the Story on Poverty for Retirees,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/business/economy/declining-old-age-poverty-may-be-on-rise-again.html,"One of the great success stories of the 20th century was the decline in poverty among the elderly. That story, however, is starting to change. A typical American worker in the middle rung of the earnings ladder -- whose career pay averaged out at about $46,000 a year in today's money -- could retire this year at age 65 with a Social Security benefit worth 39 percent of the career average. But unless something is done to replenish Social Security's shrinking trust funds, by 2035 the first pension check for such a worker might amount to as little as 27.5 percent of her career wage, according to calculations published last year by the chief actuary of the Social Security Administration. This is not merely an American trend. A preliminary analysis by economists at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the official research and policy arm of the world's advanced industrial nations, suggests that the gross replacement rates of public pension systems in a number of European countries are likely to decline over the next half century or so.

Though there are big differences among nations, according to Stefano Scarpetta, director of employment labor and social affairs at the O.E.C.D., ""in a majority of countries, the replacement rate probably will be lower than the one people have experienced so far."" It is a consequence, of course, of a broad, inexorable trend: aging. That has raised the dependency rate across industrial societies. In 1950 there were 14 people aged 65 and over in O.E.C.D. countries for every 100 people of working age. Today there are 28. The trend is expected to continue for at least the next 50 years. On average, men and women are spending seven more years in retirement than they did in 1970. Much as this represents yet another great social achievement, it has also strained the finances of public pension systems, which largely rely on current taxes to pay for retirement benefits. Public spending on old-age pensions and survivors' benefits in the O.E.C.D. rose from 6.2 to 7.9 percent of overall economic output, on average, between 1990 and 2011. As governments of most industrial nations try to restore long-term financial stability to their pension systems -- raising the retirement age, linking benefits more closely to workers' contributions and the like -- there is a growing risk, as the O.E.C.D.'s secretary general, Jose Angel Gurria, put it, ""that future pensions will not be sufficient.""

This is hardly a shock: Demographics, like ocean liners, move slowly and can be spotted from afar. On top of that, the lackluster growth and high unemployment experienced across much of the Western world in the last few years is going to make it much harder for young workers who expect to retire around midcentury from accumulating enough money to sustain a decent living standard in old age. That all raises a question that seems to be studiously avoided in polite policy conversations: Is old-age poverty going to pick up again? While the prescription may seem obvious -- policies that delay retirement and encourage working until later ages -- it is far from infallible. Indeed, it is hardly certain that elderly workers could stay longer in the work force even if they wanted to.

The O.E.C.D. devised some estimates of what to expect from pension systems. The analysis underscores just how uncertain life may become for the old.
* Elizabeth Holmes Hones Her Defense in Day 2 of Testimony
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations. A low-wage worker entering the job market today at age 20, earning half the average wage over her career, can expect a public pension equivalent to 53 percent of her wages upon retirement -- if, and this is a big if, she stays in the labor market uninterruptedly until the normal retirement age. That is (a) not a lot of money -- a quarter of the average wage-- and (b) somewhat unrealistic, given the odds of parenthood, unemployment and so many other things that might temporarily knock anyone out of a job.

According to the analysis, it gets even worse if a worker enters the labor market at age 25 rather than 20. For the record, people in the O.E.C.D. today start working, on average, at 23. Fortunately, public pensions are not retirees' only source of support. Social Security, for example, is still understood as one leg in a three-legged stool supported by a private pension and retirement savings, too. Adding up these other bits would lift the retirement income of a typical low-wage American retiree to 88 percent of her average lifetime wage, or 90 percent after accounting for her lower tax rate on retirement. This is a big improvement on the 44 percent of her lifetime wage, 54 percent after taxes, that she would get from Social Security alone. But today fewer than half of workers in the United States are covered by a private pension, and that is getting worse, too. A study by the Government Accountability Office estimated that fewer than one in five retirees among the bottom 20 percent had a defined benefit pension that pays a guaranteed monthly income and fewer than one in 10 have any retirement savings. What are the options to combat elderly poverty in the future? The challenge is particularly dire in the United States, despite a large young immigrant population, which reduces the demographic pressure: 21.5 percent of Americans 65 and older make less than half the nation's median income, almost double the O.E.C.D. average. A plausible strategy would be to increase the resources of public pension systems. In the United States, in fact, modest increases in payroll taxes, targeted on higher-income workers, could prevent the depletion of Social Security's trust funds. That poses challenges for most European countries, where taxes are relatively high, and seems politically dead on arrival in Washington -- even though the tax burden is much lower in the United States -- as long as tax-averse Republicans control Congress. The other alternative -- which most industrialized countries see as the key to overcome their demographic stress -- amounts to more work. While this is not an unreasonable proposition, it may not amount to the fix everyone is hoping for.","If Social Security's shrinking trust funds aren't replenished, pensions of the future may not be enough to live on.",3585d463-f9eb-5cbe-a7ad-dfca396d1484,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/23/business/23porter-web/23porter-web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=418&w=799&s=c8507fc673c6c7e8f4804476f882e88f20008678a7f075bbf0ed0b81c5d77e41&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A pensioner leans against the main door of a branch of the National Bank as he waits to receive part of his pension in Athens, Greece, in July.",3585d463-f9eb-5cbe-a7ad-dfca396d1484,N24News/imgs/3585d463-f9eb-5cbe-a7ad-dfca396d1484.jpg,8
Technology,Five Key Moments From Snap's I.P.O. Roadshow Video,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/technology/snapchat-ipo-video.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Snap, the parent company of the ephemeral-message application Snapchat, on Friday revealed its own story: the video presentation it will use to pitch investors as it prepares to go public in a few weeks.

The more than 35-minute video walks viewers through Snap's history, audience, products, revenue sources and expansion plans. The main message: Snap is a company where people have genuine, intimate and fun conversations.

Snap backed that contention with reams of data. The average user visits the Snapchat app more than 18 times a day and spends 25 to 30 minutes in it daily. About 60 percent of users send messages, called snaps, every day. And advertisers will pay to get their messages out to Snap's engaged users.

Beyond the investor pitch, Snap also gave insights into how and why the company created some of its products. The presentation included interviews with Evan Spiegel, the chief executive of Snap, and his fellow founder Bobby Murphy, and a more in-depth peek into the company's culture.","As the parent company of Snapchat prepares for one of the most anticipated market debuts of the year, it tells its own story.",9eb3346e-36c6-55df-8790-201d3fdcf32d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/18/technology/18snap-web1/18snap-web1-facebookJumbo.png?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=3b178559fa1976df6574cdee1dcec3ee3895764a8faf820c28a0a19eaf8739e0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Snap, the parent company of the popular messaging app Snapchat, posted a video aimed at investors as it readies for one of the most anticipated I.P.O.s of the year.",9eb3346e-36c6-55df-8790-201d3fdcf32d,N24News/imgs/9eb3346e-36c6-55df-8790-201d3fdcf32d.jpg,20
Automobiles,"Video Review: Decent Handling in a Toyota Prius? Yes, the New One",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/automobiles/autoreviews/toyota-prius-car-review.html,"American buyers are gravitating toward S.U.V.s these days, but for those who value fuel-efficient cars, the Toyota Prius has become the gold standard over the years. Never known for engaging driving dynamics or passionate design, this is the fourth generation. (ON CAMERA) Just so you know, there's a plug-in hybrid version coming in late 2016. Called the Prius Prime. It seats four, has an estimated all electric range of 22 miles and gets... slightly... different... styling. Certainly, you've decided whether the polarizing lines appeal to you or not. Give Toyota credit for going all in. After hours of photographing it, I understand the lines better. I want a set of these tail lamps in my home as art. (SOUND UP?) The silhouette is among the most aerodynamic you can buy and Prius sits on Toyota's new TNGA platform that the next- generation Camry will ride on. (ON CAMERA) Prius is a hybrid and it does those hybridy kinds of things. As before ,coasting and braking charges the battery. Remember this model doesn't get plugged in. (SOUND UP) The gas engine shuts down at stoplights. Typically Prius (SOUND UP) initially pulls away on electric power before the gas engine smoothly feathers in. Careful drivers can keep track of their efficiency almost like a game, much safer than playing Pokemon Go at the wheel. The hybrid components and transaxle that includes a continuously variable transmission are all more compact. The 1.8-liter gas engine is more efficient too. All Prii except the base model use a new lithium-ion battery tucked under here now. Total power output from the four-cylinder and two motor/generators is 121 horsepower. (ON CAMERA) Remember, on start up (beep) there is no engine sound) A happy little show on a far better display greets you. The transmission selector remains pretty much the same. (SOUND UP PULLING AWAY) A leisurely 0-60 time of about 10 seconds remains the same. GFX- On a well-charged battery, EV Mode allows electric-only travel for short distances at low speeds (ON CAMERA) Under hard acceleration the engine is quieter now. There's less of that rubbery elastic dynamic from the transmission though it is still there a bit. Prius may not look like a conventional car but it definitely drives more like one now. (ON CAMERA) Toyota has been promising better handling from their cars for years now and Prius delivers. It no longer corners like a damp rag. It's not a sports car but it's definitely better. The brake feel is improved, transitioning from power regeneration to the physical brakes being used is fairly seamless. (ON CAMERA) Visibility is great in this car, if you haven't noticed, lots of glass, like a big bubble. Kind makes me want to try driving a Pacer. GFX- E.P.A. rated fuel economy is 54 city / 50 hwy Eco model is 58 city / 53 hwy But most people are primarily interested in fuel economy and once again, Prius improves. I'm easily seeing 52 miles-per- gallon without changing my driving habits. Impressive. Drive modes are available, I didn't notice a huge difference, ""power"" is certainly not ""ludicrous"" mode. Perhaps you noticed the color way used inside the cabin. For those who don't want to be reminded of their first iPod or an Orca whale, black and beige are available. And yes, dirt does show. Materials are a HUGE step up from the utilitarian plastics in the outgoing model. Toyota's user interface is very straightforward and a backup camera is standard. (ON CAMERA) Prius is not a small car. The back seat is actually fairly roomy, though your very tall friend may want to ride up front. Two average adults will be very comfortable, three will be fine when not testing out Prius' estimated 588 mile range. The cargo hold is roomy for those who think they need a crossover to lug stuff around. (ON CAMERA) No TP Trunk test this week, something a little bit practical, I have chores to do. My wife's been after me to donate this stuff for weeks. Who doesn't have a beanbag chair that needs to be unloaded. Without issue, Prius gobbles stuff up handily. I think I'll run into the house and get that old printer too. Prices start at 25 thousand dollars for a Prius Two (there is no One). This Three model with Advanced Tech package stickers 30 grand. Prius remains the best way to save gas without having to plug in. Polarizing design? Well it's not as if it's alone. Right? Other than opinions on that, there's no arguing that Toyota has improved the Prius experience all the way around.","The fuel economy of the new fourth-generation Prius is better than the departing model, and a new multilink rear suspension upgrades the ride quality.",120f360f-e16d-587c-a369-6118b57d70a6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/01/automobiles/autoreviews/driven-prius-three/driven-prius-three-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=57c393d111a2f3bf1c603b88068e9484bd2d1eecbfe0b5b499e3b4eea67db970&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The new Toyota Prius is still stingy on gas, getting 54 miles per gallon in the city and 50 on the highway.",120f360f-e16d-587c-a369-6118b57d70a6,N24News/imgs/120f360f-e16d-587c-a369-6118b57d70a6.jpg,23
Fashion & Style,"Jackie Kennedy's Packing List for Texas, Chic and Poignant",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/fashion/jackie-kennedy-texas-packing-list.html,"Jackie Kennedy's recently resurfaced packing list for the fateful autumn trip to Texas she took with her husband, President John F. Kennedy, contains plenty of interest for fashion historians.

In the margins of the weekend's itinerary, which she had written out for her personal assistant, the first lady scheduled the visit outfit by outfit. For the day of Nov. 21, her look would be head-to-toe Chanel: a white coat, skirt and blouse, with a black hat atop her head and a gold and navy bracelet on her wrist (""safety pin,"" she wrote underneath, perhaps in reference to its clasp). In the evening, she would don a black velvet dress with satin shoes and white kid gloves. And of course the jewelry had been considered: pearls with a diamond bracelet and earrings. Mrs. Kennedy was not one to leave room for surprises.

But even the best laid plans can change. The gloves, for one, surfaced on her descent from Air Force One in Houston, paired with the daytime Chanel suit. If she wore the bracelet, it went unseen. And the days that followed would stray much further from the first lady's notes.

Jackie Kennedy's bloodstained pink Chanel suit tells more acutely than any other image the story of what happened in Dallas on Friday, Nov. 22. But the notes she prepared for her personal assistant, Providencia Paredes, read as stage directions for a weekend of political theater and a catalog of the wardrobe that made her the most fashionable first lady of the 20th century, referenced by her successors to this day.","Chanel suits, Cassini dresses, riding clothes and jewelry for a weekend cut tragically short.",626b8b79-edfd-5c92-9d38-ceaead22735b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/08/fashion/08jackiefashion1/08jackiefashion1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=01a474adf083191714fb7cf81f3581981918668fdf7a7fa4f5e78756e902157f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"President John F.

Technology,The New Apple Watch Measures Your Blood Oxygen. Now What?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/technology/personaltech/new-apple-watch-blood-oxygen-level-review.html,"The new Apple Watch can be summed up in two words: blood oxygen.

The ability to measure your blood's oxygen saturation -- an overall indicator of wellness -- is the most significant new feature in the Apple Watch Series 6, which was unveiled this week and becomes available on Friday. (The watch is otherwise not that different from last year's Apple watch.) The feature is particularly timely with the coronavirus, because some patients in critical condition with Covid-19 have had low blood oxygen levels.

But how useful is this feature for all of us, really?

I had a day to test the new $399 Apple Watch to measure my blood oxygen level. The process was simple: You open the blood oxygen app on the device, keep your wrist steady and hit the Start button. After 15 seconds, during which a sensor on the back of the watch measures your blood oxygen level by shining lights onto your wrist, it shows your reading. In three tests, my blood oxygen level stood between 99 percent and 100 percent.

I wasn't quite sure what to do with this information. So I asked two medical experts about the new feature. Both were cautiously optimistic about its potential benefits, especially for research. The ability to constantly monitor blood oxygen levels with some degree of accuracy, they said, could help people discover symptoms for health conditions like sleep apnea.

""Continuous recording of data can be really interesting to see trends,"" said Cathy A. Goldstein, a sleep physician at the University of Michigan's Medicine Sleep Clinic, who has researched data collected by Apple Watches.","Blood oxygen readings can be a useful indicator of wellness, but context is important — and so is medical advice from a doctor.",398d1161-3f98-5858-8318-23a08a607449,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/18/business/17techfix1-print/17techfix1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=82a784331e3079174fe84e47d511e1be9f46b2cd1224cd6d7156e295516f249a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Apple Watch Series 6 features a blood oxygen sensor and app.,398d1161-3f98-5858-8318-23a08a607449,N24News/imgs/398d1161-3f98-5858-8318-23a08a607449.jpg,20
Technology,"Frances Allen, Who Helped Hardware Understand Software, Dies at 88",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/08/technology/frances-allen-dead.html,"Frances Allen in 2003 at IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. She was the first woman to win the A.M. Turing Award, often called the Nobel Prize of computing.





Frances Allen, a computer scientist and researcher who helped create the fundamental ideas that allow practically anyone to build fast, efficient and useful software for computers, smartphones and websites, died on Tuesday, her 88th birthday, in Schenectady, N.Y. Her death, in a nursing home, was confirmed by her great-nephew Ryan McKee, who said the cause was Alzheimer's disease. In the mid-1960s, after developing software for an early supercomputer at the National Security Agency, Ms. Allen returned to her work at IBM, then the world's leading computer company. At an IBM lab in the Hudson River Valley town of Yorktown Heights, just north of New York City, she and her fellow researchers spent the next four decades refining a key component of modern computing: the ""compiler,"" the software technology that takes in programs written by humans and turns them into something computers can understand. For Ms. Allen, the aim was to do this as efficiently as possible, so programmers could build software in simple and intuitive ways and then have it run quickly and smoothly when deployed on real-world machines.

Together with the researcher John Cocke, she published a series of landmark papers in the late 1960s and '70s describing this delicate balance between ease of creation and speed of execution. These ideas helped drive the evolution of computer programming -- all the way to the present day, when even relative novices can easily build fast and efficient software apps for a world of computers, smartphones and other devices. In 2006, on the strength of this work, Ms. Allen became the first woman to win the A.M. Turing Award, often called the Nobel Prize of computing. ""She was crucial in providing easier and easier ways for humans to tell computers what to do,"" said Prof. Michelle Mills Strout, who teaches computer science at the University of Arizona and specializes in compiler technology. Frances Elizabeth Allen was born on Aug. 4, 1932, in Peru, N.Y., near Lake Champlain and about 30 miles from the Canadian border. Her parents, John and Ruth (Downs) Allen, owned a dairy farm, and Ms. Allen, the oldest of six children, grew up there without running water or electricity. Electricity did not arrive until the early 1940s, and even then it ran only to the barn, not to the family home. Ms. Allen attended a one-room school less than a mile away and did her part on the farm, from milking cows to helping with the field work. After graduating with honors from the local high school, she studied at the New York State College for Teachers (now the University at Albany, part of the State University of New York).

Returning to Peru, she worked briefly as a teacher. Her sister, Catherine, was among her students. Ms. Allen earned a master's degree in mathematics at the University of Michigan in 1957 and took a job with IBM at an office in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., as a way to pay off her college debt. Though she had planned to return to teaching, she stayed with the company for the next 45 years.

At first Ms. Allen taught incoming employees how to use a new programming language called Fortran. Previously, engineers had programmed computers using a language of ones and zeros, which was understood by the computer hardware. With Fortran, one of the first high-level programming languages, they could build software in more intuitive ways, without mastering the arcane operations of the computer hardware. It was a concept that Ms. Allen would push to new heights. Ms. Allen joined the top-secret effort to build a supercomputer at the National Security Agency in the early 1960s. (In doing a background check on her, government officials had descended on her hometown to talk to local farmers about her.) The N.S.A. machine, called Stretch-Harvest, was intended to analyze communications intercepted by listening posts operated by American spies around the globe. Ms. Allen helped build the machine's programming language and compiler. In those early years of computer design, compilers were terribly inefficient. Programmers could build software without learning the minutiae of the hardware, but when the compiler converted their programs into ones and zeros, they were far too slow and took up far too much space. As part of an IBM research project created in the late 1960s, Ms. Allen worked to change this dynamic. In the beginning, she and her colleagues built more efficient compilers for the massive mainframe computers of the day. In later years, they applied similar ideas to ""parallel computing,"" a newer technique that spread digital tasks across multiple computers.

The result, several decades on, was modern computer programming. Programmers can now build smartphone apps, like Facebook, that respond to the touch without delay, delivered from vast computer data centers spanning tens of thousands of computers. Ms. Allen's work plays into ""pretty much every software system anyone uses: every app, every website, every video game or communication system, every government or bank computer, every onboard computer in a car or aircraft,"" said Graydon Hoare, creator of a programming language called Rust. ""Without good compilers,"" he added, ""the whole world of software would be much slower, costlier, more error-prone, less capable."" Ms. Allen's marriage to Jacob Schwartz, a computer science professor at New York University and one of her collaborators on compiler research, ended in divorce. She is survived by two brothers, Phillip and James, and her sister, Catherine McKee. In a field long dominated by men, Ms. Allen was a force for change. In the 1970s and '80s, thanks largely to her own efforts, women accounted for half of the experimental compiler group inside IBM. ""One the many things Fran did was attract women to her field,"" said Jeanne Ferrante, who worked alongside Ms. Allen for more than a decade. ""She looked out for the people who were underrepresented."" In 1989 she became the first female IBM fellow, a rare honor bestowed on the company's leading engineers, scientists and programmers. But when she received her award at an IBM retreat in Southern California, the company identified her as a man. (""In recognition and appreciation of his outstanding technical contributions ..."") The award -- including the mistake -- remained on her office wall until she retired in 2002. ""She broke the glass ceiling,"" said Mark Wegman, another IBM fellow, who worked with Ms. Allen for decades. ""At the time, no one even thought someone like her could achieve what she achieved.""","One of the few women in the computer industry in its early days, she paved the way for the efficient, lightning-fast apps of today.",dd9cab21-7f06-5985-bef3-dba804c29705,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/10/obituaries/07Allen1/07Allen1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=499&w=954&s=7549e7e20faa9daf748a42943829156fb74d9d90b0efdedce4eb062edbead549&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Frances Allen in 2003 at IBM&rsquo;s T.J.

Economy,A Child Care Gap in the Résumé: Whether to Explain or Not,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/business/economy/a-child-care-gap-in-the-resume-whether-to-explain-or-not.html,"A Child Care Gap in the Resume: Whether to Explain or Not

When Brooke Bleyl started job hunting after taking 10 years off to care for her children, her interviews did not go well. ""They even said they typically don't hire people with such a gap,"" said Ms. Bleyl, who lives outside Cleveland and has three children, ages 7, 10 and 12. Ms. Bleyl, who worked as an employment recruiter before taking time off, said she tried to fill in gaps on her resume, including online selling to earn extra money. ""But when you see eBay on someone's resume, you know that's a stay-at-home job,"" she said, ""and that you're just selling stuff out of your basement."" After receiving ""rejection after rejection after rejection,"" Ms. Bleyl said, ""I was very defeated."" She eventually found a job as an account manager at a staffing service, but only with the help of a personal connection.

For women hoping to return to the workplace after caring for their children, the advice is often ""don't ask, don't tell."" Many women who described themselves as stay-at-home mothers can attest to receiving denigrating nods and hasty rebuffs. Researchers have repeatedly found ample evidence of discrimination against mothers in the hiring process and the workplace. But women may be better off explaining their decision to stay home to a potential employer upfront, said Joni Hersch, a professor of law and economics at Vanderbilt Law School, and co-author of a new study on the subject, ""Something to Talk About: Information Exchange Under Employment Law."" Employers, afraid of running afoul of anti-discrimination laws, don't bring up the subject, she said, and female applicants, picking up on those cues, often don't offer information, leaving hirers to guess at the reasons behind a hiatus. But, Professor Hersch said, ""women who conceal personal information dramatically lower their hiring prospects."" Ms. Bleyl, despite her own experience, shares that view. ""It's better to be upfront, because it's who you are,"" she said. ""I was so hungry to get in there and work, work, work."" Carol Fishman Cohen is chief executive and co-founder of iRelaunch, a firm that works with returning professionals and potential employers. Her advice to applicants is to briefly acknowledge the career break and quickly move on to explain why they are the best suited for the job.

""Don't apologize for it,"" Ms. Cohen said. ""Say, 'Yes, I took a career break for child care reasons, and now I can't wait to get back to work.'"" Not everybody will be open to such an approach. But many will. ""I think it comes down to the hiring manager,"" Ms. Cohen said. ""If the individual has someone in their own personal orbit who has taken a career break, they are much more likely to be interested in the caliber and potential of that population than someone who has not had the experience."" Playing up volunteer and freelance work is important, she said, but it's a mistake to emphasize ""mom skills"" that are required for managing family life. The interviewer could be doing all that and working as well. Some experts were skeptical of the experiment Professor Hersch and her co-author, Jennifer Bennett Shinall, an assistant law professor at Vanderbilt, conducted for their study. They said it was too far removed from the actual job-hunting experience.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions.
* $15 minimum wage for federal contractors will take effect Jan. 30. The authors of the study, which is to be presented at the annual American Law and Economics Association conference on Friday and published in a forthcoming issue of the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, did not interview recruiters or human resources professionals. Instead, they asked more than 3,000 people recruited online to act as potential employers and choose one of two candidates with similar experience. One applicant provided an explanation for a 10-year gap in her job history -- such as taking time off to raise children and then going through a divorce -- while the other provided no explanation at all. Those who revealed the personal information were 30 to 40 percent more likely to be chosen than those without.

""The number of people who preferred the woman who explained her resume gap was staggering,"" Professor Hersch said. ""I was shocked."" She said that the way many employers have responded to the law prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of sex, Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, serves to hinder women rather than help them. In their report, Professor Hersch and Professor Shinall argue that overly broad guidance offered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the primary federal agency entrusted with enforcing the law in the workplace, has had the effect of freezing out discussion about family life during interviews. The commission, for example, warns employers, ""Questions about marital status and number and ages of children are frequently used to discriminate against women and may violate Title VII if used to deny or limit employment opportunities."" Professor Hersch says that more neutral language that invites employers to broach the issue of family with all candidates -- both men and women -- would be preferable. A lot of the interview process is about ensuring a good fit, she said, but now there is ""an environment where you're dancing around the elephant in the room."" Ofer Sharone, a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who researches career transitions and hiring, disagrees. He said that changing the E.E.O.C. guidelines would be disastrous. Marriage and children tend to hurt women much more than men in the workplace, he said, and Professor Hersch's and Professor Shinall's recommendation ""would greatly exacerbate that discrimination.""

Employers often wrongly assume that mothers will not be able to commit to their jobs as much if they're committed to their families. Saying a candidate is the wrong fit can be code for discrimination, Professor Sharone said. Reducing the choice to one woman who explains a gap and another who doesn't, he said, misses the more likely reality: that both would probably be screened out before they got to the interview stage. Employers are looking to filter through a huge number of applications in the quickest way possible. ""If there's a gap,"" Professor Sharone said recruiters had consistently told him, they are ""going to go with someone without a gap."" Professor Sharone and other researchers did agree that if a candidate made it to the interview stage, then explaining a gap was better than leaving it to the employers' imagination. Joan C. Williams, founding director of the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California, Hastings, agreed that the researchers are on to something. ""Given how strong the bias is against mothers, women should seize hold of the situation,"" she said, rather than cede interpretation to a potential employer. When Stephanie Bond decided to re-enter the work force after taking off a couple of years to care for her two sons in 2012, she ended up getting hired by a recruiter she had contacted. ""I said I was a road warrior and took the opportunity to reconnect with my family,"" said Ms. Bond, who was also able to list consulting work on her resume to cover any gap.

Real Estate,New York Real Estate Is On the Mend,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/09/realestate/new-york-city-real-estate-return.html,"The suburbs have had their moment. New Yorkers who left at the peak of the pandemic are starting to come back, lured by a range of discounts and a sense, albeit tenuous, that the city is on the mend. The city is far from over Covid-19, but residents are returning to find deals on bigger and better apartments for less, especially in Manhattan's crowded rental market. Buyers are moving to Brooklyn and Queens, to take advantage of near-record-low mortgage rates and relatively lower prices. Newcomers are arriving with job offers, even as remote work and high unemployment disrupt their industries. And for those who never left, there is a measure of vindication that they -- not the investors or pied-a-terre owners who for years have spurred prices -- are now driving the real estate market. At the same time, a spike in new sales activity in several suburbs surrounding New York seems to be slowing, as pent-up demand wanes, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. Bidding wars arrived in some suburbs in late spring, as coronavirus cases in the city climbed and in-person showings were restricted. But by July, sales in several suburbs, including Westchester and parts of Long Island, appeared to peak. Sales there remain higher than the same time last year, but it's likely that many of those buyers were planning to leave the city eventually, and the pandemic simply accelerated their plans, Mr. Miller said.

In June, Derek Saathoff and his husband, Manuel Pares, both 37, left their cramped studio rental in Chelsea to move to Miami and be closer to family there. The couple, who work at One Management, a talent management agency, expected to stay at least until the end of the year, because they could work remotely. But, while away, they learned of a new vacancy in their Chelsea building -- a sunny, 900-square-foot one-bedroom on a higher floor -- marked down nearly $1,000 from its pre-Covid price tag. They signed the lease, sight unseen, and returned to New York in August. ""Pre-Covid, we wouldn't have gotten this deal,"" Mr. Saathoff said, noting that the apartment was significantly bigger, newly renovated, and just a few hundred dollars more expensive than their nearly $3,000-a-month studio. ""We've never had a door before,"" he said, relishing the perks of a true one-bedroom.

The city is still reeling from the virus. The number of apartments sold in Manhattan in the last three months was down 46 percent, compared to the same period last year. There is a gaping budget deficit, crime is on the rise, and the share of positive Covid-19 results, while lower than in many other cities, is climbing just as schools and struggling businesses are reopening. In response, the state announced this week that it will once again close schools and nonessential businesses, and sharply restrict attendance at houses of worship in parts of Brooklyn and Queens, as well as in swaths of some northern suburbs, for at least two weeks, based on the severity of recent spikes in new cases. But there are signs of improvement, too. Outdoor diners line commercial thoroughfares, young families animate the parks, and some cherished cultural institutions are reviving. That renewed energy has contributed to a 27.5 percent drop in new listings for sale in September -- the first decline in inventory in five months, said Mr. Miller, and a strong indicator that sellers are no longer in panic mode. While sales have not yet exceeded year-ago levels, the number of contracts signed have increased every month since May. Discounts of under 10 percent are widespread, but prices have yet to plummet, except in segments of the ultraluxury tier. Brooklyn, and to a lesser extent, Queens, have had even greater momentum since in-person showings restarted in June. There were 364 new contracts signed in Brooklyn last month, a 21 percent jump over the same time last year, according to the brokerage Douglas Elliman. And the focus has been on more affordable stock: Over half of the sales were under $1 million, and nearly all were below $2 million. The pace of sales on the lower-end of the market is a reflection of who remains in the city. A disproportionate share of the New Yorkers who left -- an estimated 420,000 people, from March to the beginning of May -- were affluent, mobile, and precisely the target demographic for thousands of overpriced, currently vacant apartments. Their departure to the suburbs and beyond flattened an already sluggish market reliant on people who own more than one home. Many others left because of job loss, school closures and health concerns. For those with the means to stay in New York, there are new incentives. Rental inventory in Manhattan reached a 14-year high in September, with 15,923 units available, roughly triple the inventory from the same time last year, Mr. Miller said. The average concession in Manhattan is now two months of free rent on a one-year lease, which is tied for the highest rate in the last decade. One large apartment firm, Choice New York Companies, which manages 225 buildings in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, said their vacancy rate has shot up to 13.5 percent, up from just 3.5 percent this time last year, in part because of tenants breaking their leases and moving away.

Alex Domond, 52, a Harlem renter, left the city in mid-March to stay with family in Lake Harmony, Pa., because her sons have asthma and she feared riding the subway to her office in Midtown, where she works in finance. She returned in May and began biking to and from work, on a scenic 30-minute ride, but she knew the route would be difficult in the winter. So she inquired about an 850-square-foot, two-bedroom, one-bath apartment at Waterside Plaza on a high floor overlooking the East River that was listed for $4,300 a month -- and negotiated the price to $3,600, a 16 percent discount. The rent is higher than what she paid for her Harlem apartment, but her bike route is now much more manageable, the complex has several amenities, and the views of the river are prismatic. ""It's like the windows are this ever changing canvas,"" she said. Many left the city out of financial necessity, but found a way back, in spite of the flagging job market.

But he, and the dance world, adapted. The company he worked for, Dance Church, was able to hire him part-time in an administrative role, and he is now part of a team producing a dance film with the New York-based company HEIDCO. He returned to his Brooklyn apartment in August, with a new puppy and a used Toyota. His landlord allowed him to pay half-rent while he was away, on the condition that he pay back the balance. His pay is significantly lower than it was before the pandemic, but with the aid of temporary unemployment benefits, he has so far been able to cover his expenses. ""I wasn't sure if I was going to come back,"" he said, purely for financial reasons. ""But I realized New York is where I want to make my forever home.""

Staying may not be possible for thousands of New Yorkers who have fallen behind on rent and face possible eviction, despite assurances from federal and state government that protections are in place through the rest of the year. Without a mechanism for rent forgiveness, there are several scenarios in which evictions may proceed. The unemployment rate in New York City was 16 percent in August, and some of the hardest hit neighborhoods are in Queens and the Bronx, where rents have rapidly increased in recent years, because of an affordable housing crunch in the city.

Despite the fragile economy in New York, some newcomers are finding job opportunities and a reason to move cross-country. Sasha Palo, 38, a medical lab scientist, moved to the Upper East Side from Kansas City, Kan., after landing a new job here during the height of the pandemic. Ms. Palo had dreamed of moving to New York since she was a child living in the Philippines, but moved to the Midwest on a work visa. When she learned her lab position was going to be eliminated in February, she applied, on a whim, for a similar role at a large hospital in New York -- work that would soon include testing a flood of patients for Covid-19. ""I felt like my job is very critical in this crisis,"" she said, especially in a city like New York. When she got the offer, ""I didn't hesitate at all -- I didn't even think about where I was going to live.""

For William Pan, 32, a Manhattan renter who grew up in Queens, now seemed like the right time to buy, in part because of the exceptionally low mortgage rates, but also because of condo developers' eagerness to proceed with deals. He and his fiancee, Cammy Vu, an accountant, are under contract to buy a more than 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment with an additional 400 square feet of outdoor space at the Neighborly, an under-construction condo in Long Island City. Mr. Pan, who works in finance, declined to give the sale price, but said the developer offered to cover a full year of common charges and real estate taxes, worth more than $20,000; to pay for all of the associated transfer taxes, or about $38,000; and to throw in a discounted, deeded parking space. ""It's really the deal of a lifetime, compared to what I was eyeing in Manhattan,"" he said, despite the fact that the apartment likely will not be ready until early next year. In the meantime, he is living in a rental apartment nearby.","The recovery is tenuous, but renters are returning, buyers are getting deals, and those who stayed are finding a measure of vindication.",f5945721-d742-5185-8b62-053dda77c126,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/11/realestate/09return5/09return5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=351d6560d6b4e9469fe4edacd3c8471034320bdb465db1701bc04ec9f20950d2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Alex Domond, center, with her sons Olivier and Noah.

Sports,Giants' General Manager Is Noncommittal on Eli Manning's Future,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/sports/ny-giants-eli-manning.html,"EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Giants General Manager Dave Gettleman gave a rousing endorsement of Coach Pat Shurmur, stood behind his decision to draft running back Saquon Barkley and laughed off suggestions that the team might trade receiver Odell Beckham Jr. But Gettleman, in his first news conference with reporters since the summer, remained surprisingly noncommittal on Wednesday about quarterback Eli Manning's future with the Giants, leaving the door open for the organization to potentially move on from its two-time Super Bowl most valuable player this off-season. ""We will do what's in the best interest of the New York Giants,"" Gettleman said, before adding: ""What we're trying to do here is build sustained success. That takes some brutal honesty, and it takes some tough decisions."" Gettleman said he and Manning had met for an ""extensive"" conversation on Monday that he deemed to be ""very honest and upfront."" Notably, it was Manning who initiated the discussion.

""Eli came in and wanted to talk,"" Gettleman said. ""It wasn't like he was called to the principal's office; he came to see me.""

Manning, who turns 38 on Thursday and is under contract through the 2019 season, started all 16 games for the Giants this season and threw for 4,299 yards with 21 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. He completed 66 percent of his passes, a career high, and finished with a 92.4 quarterback rating, his highest since 2015. But the Giants started with a 1-7 record this season before finishing 5-11, and they have an 8-23 record over the past two years with Manning as the starter. There are questions about his pocket presence, decision-making and arm strength -- including from Beckham, who criticized Manning in an interview with ESPN in October. Gettleman pointed to the offense's productivity in December, when the Giants scored 30, 40, 27 and 35 points (they also were shut out by the Tennessee Titans on Dec. 16). ""He still can make N.F.L. throws,"" Gettleman said of Manning. ""He's still got it."" Shurmur shares that opinion, having defended Manning throughout the season -- and especially in recent weeks regarding the quarterback's ability to return as the Giants' starter in 2019. On Monday, he said Manning should be evaluated based on his performance in the second half of the season.

""I think he was better able to showcase what he could do once we solidified the offensive line,"" Shurmur said. ""I think that's a fair assessment."" As for how he planned to assess Manning's performance amid the swings in fortune throughout the season, Gettleman was less effusive. He said he would watch film ""until my eyes bleed."" Manning has a full no-trade clause, and cutting him would incur a sizable hit to the Giants' salary cap. Nevertheless, Gettleman said, ""everything is on the table for us."" Gettleman executed an extensive roster overhaul this season, his first as the team's general manager. But the Giants still finished last in the N.F.C. East, leaving them with the No. 6 overall pick in the coming draft. This year's class is not expected to contain the same caliber of quarterback prospects as last year, when the quarterbacks Baker Mayfield, Sam Darnold, Josh Rosen and Josh Allen all went in the first 10 slots of the draft. Still, Gettleman defended his decision to draft Barkley, a running back, with the second overall pick in 2018. Barkley ran for 1,307 yards, a Giants rookie record, and added 721 yards receiving. ""If I was in that situation 100 times, I'd draft him 100 times,"" Gettleman said of Barkley. His assessment of the 2019 draft options remained the same as a year ago, he said, but he did not rule out selecting a quarterback. The Giants did select a quarterback in the fourth round last summer, Kyle Lauletta, who struggled in his lone appearance of the season, going 0 for 5 with one interception during the second half against Washington on Dec. 9. ""You're going to take the best player available,"" Gettleman said. ""You start reaching, you're going to get in trouble.""","Dave Gettleman strongly endorsed Coach Pat Shurmur and receiver Odell Beckham Jr., but he was noncommittal on the future of the team's aging quarterback.",dd084890-cd53-557f-9c80-8b0f347b5322,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/03/sports/03giants-top/03giants-top-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=4f1c4927818c419d38e548f02678d555cd5c7e917b4fae277ce396ab1aec81e2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Eli Manning started all 16 games for the Giants this season, finishing with a 92.4 quarterback rating, his highest since 2015.",dd084890-cd53-557f-9c80-8b0f347b5322,N24News/imgs/dd084890-cd53-557f-9c80-8b0f347b5322.jpg,9
Technology,Russia Investigation Has Tech Giants Shying From 'Social' Label,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/technology/russia-investigation-tech-companies.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- After years of trying unsuccessfully to build a social network to rival Facebook, Google finally got something out of all of its failures: cover. Members of Congress grilled the executives of Google, Facebook and Twitter this week in a trio of hearings focused on the role that social media played in advancing a Russian disinformation campaign before the 2016 election. Google's representative at two of the hearings, Kent Walker, the company's general counsel, made a point of distinguishing the search giant from its internet brethren. Repeatedly and unequivocally, he answered questions at the hearings by saying, ""We're not a social network."" Tech companies have taken a pounding in the court of public opinion in recent months. In the eyes of their critics, they have become too big, too powerful and too unmindful of their influence. And this week's congressional hearings cast added and unflattering light on the industry's growing embarrassment over the Russian election meddling. ""Without sufficient oversight, these companies never imagined hostile intelligence services would misuse their platforms in this way,"" said Renee DiResta, an independent security researcher at Data for Democracy. ""The people running it appear to not fully appreciate what they've designed.""

Not surprisingly, perhaps, a few of the industry's biggest companies have been happy to say, in essence, don't blame us. Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive and an outspoken critic of the data-collection practices of his company's technological rivals, said Wednesday that he was concerned that social networks could be weaponized against the people who use them. ""The bigger issue is that some of these tools are used to divide people, to manipulate people, to get fake news to people in broad numbers, and so to influence their thinking,"" said Mr. Cook in an interview with NBC News. Frank Shaw, head of communications at Apple's longtime rival, Microsoft, praised Mr. Cook's comments in a Twitter post, saying that Mr. Cook had framed the issue ""perfectly."" Last year, Microsoft did purchase LinkedIn, a career-oriented social network, for $26.2 billion, but that site appears to have played little role in Russia's influence efforts. With the emergence of Facebook, Twitter and their ilk over the last decade, ""social"" became a key Silicon Valley buzzword as companies crammed social network-like features into new products. Even Apple, despite the tens of billions of dollars it has earned making computing devices, has tried its hand at a social network focused on music.

But as social media has become increasingly connected to unpleasant bickering, race-baiting and Russian propaganda, the must-have ""social"" label has become an albatross, said Joseph Bayer, an assistant professor at Ohio State University who focuses on social networks. ""The mere fact that a tech company is trying to minimize its overall influence is a telling signal of the moment we're in,"" said Mr. Bayer. Google, which operates under the parent company Alphabet, can offer a distinction between its business and how social networks operate -- largely because its attempts to build a social network have not been very successful. The company spent millions of dollars creating Google+, a social site built specifically to take on Facebook. The company tied Google+ into nearly every one of its properties, describing it as the ""social spine"" of Google in public statements at the time. There also were short-lived efforts like Google Buzz and Google Wave, or geographically specific sites like Orkut -- popular in Brazil but ignored elsewhere. Google+ continues to exist but it is considered a disappointment. Google said it had found no political posts from state-linked actors on Google+. Google has often tried to fashion YouTube, its sprawling video service, into something more like a social network in hopes of keeping visitors interested. Last year, YouTube added what it called its ""Community"" product, essentially features intended to inspire users to interact more with one another.

Google said accounts believed to have ties to the Kremlin had uploaded more than 1,100 videos to YouTube on racial, religious and political topics. Those videos were viewed 309,000 times. Many of those videos had only a small number of views, though they were ""frequently posted to other social media platforms,"" Richard Salgado, Google's senior counsel in law enforcement and information security, told a Senate subcommittee on Tuesday. Facebook, to offer a comparison, estimated that 150 million users of Facebook and its subsidiary, Instagram, had been exposed to 80,000 posts that came from the Russian influence campaign. Twitter said it had discovered more than 2,700 accounts that were linked to Russia's Internet Research Agency, a company tied to the Kremlin, between September 2016 and November 2016. Those accounts posted roughly 131,000 tweets over that period. Twitter identified an additional 36,000 automated accounts that had posted 1.4 million election-related tweets linked to Russia over that same period. The tweets received about 288 million views. ""Now you're seeing all the attention from Congress go to Facebook and Twitter, because they're the linchpin"" of the Russian information operations, said Ms. DiResta, the security researcher. In his testimony on Capitol Hill, Mr. Walker, Google's general counsel, sought to draw a bright line separating his company's services from social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, which has been an occasional subject of Google acquisition rumors. He also played down what Google knows about its users, a surprising conceit for a company that makes more money than anybody from selling advertising based on the online interests of users. ""We're somewhat differently positioned because we're not primarily a social network,"" Mr. Walker said in response to a question regarding whether Google should notify users who are exposed to propaganda or divisive content from a foreign government. ""Many users are not logged in when they access content, so it's difficult to know who sees what.""","Not long ago, social media features were a must-have for any tech company. But the Russian disinformation campaign has put them in an unflattering light.",f110a9d5-b95e-5748-bd8c-e08171255ba1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/03/business/03ANTISOCIAL1/03ANTISOCIAL1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=baf6aa5f062e29bdca1e34798e73a12dcf0ebca3bd2d94394feaf2a80b58bdf0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Kent Walker, Google's general counsel, repeatedly distanced his company from the social media companies that also appeared at congressional hearings on Russian influence efforts during the 2016 presidential campaign.",f110a9d5-b95e-5748-bd8c-e08171255ba1,N24News/imgs/f110a9d5-b95e-5748-bd8c-e08171255ba1.jpg,20

(Streaming services occasionally change schedules without giving notice.) Strange things are happening once again in Hawkins, Ind. It's the summer of 1985, and the psychokinetic Eleven (Millie Bobbie Brown) and her friends have their hands full: Apart from the economic pressure on the small town created by the shiny new Starcourt Mall, there are also inexplicable rat infestations and weird magnetic malfunctions, not to mention the mysterious voices and cryptic codes being transmitted on local airwaves. Are these things all connected? Can the gang somehow fend them off, or is this the end of their sleepy town? New cast members abound this season, including Cary Elwes as the sleazy mayor, Jake Busey as a troublesome journalist and Maya Hawke as the coolest girl at the ice cream shop.

This documentary, directed by Jehane Noujaim and Karim Amer, puts a human face on the Cambridge Analytica data and election-meddling scandal by focusing largely on Brittany Kaiser, a former Cambridge employee who has helped reveal the company's murky internal workings. ""The Great Hack"" follows Kaiser from the annual Burning Man gathering to a hideaway in Thailand and to London, along the way examining the results of various government inquiries into the company's actions. The film also lays out why Kaiser finally came forward despite the blizzard of legal and media blowback she's had to face.

The documentary from Erin Lee Carr (whose father was David Carr, a New York Times columnist who died in 2015) explores the troubling context of this Massachusetts case, and the legal precedents it set. The film is divided into two parts, one dealing with the prosecution's case, the other that of the defense. In the writer-director Pippa Bianco's award-winning feature debut, high school student Mandy (Rhianne Barreto) wakes up on her parents' front lawn, wondering how she got there and what happened to her the night before. She soon finds out -- her classmates are circulating a video in which she appears to be unconscious, lying on a floor with a laughing crowd gathered around and a boy pulling down her underwear. We enter into Mandy's head space via hazy images, impressionistic flashes and extreme close-ups as she tries to figure out what happened, how she feels and what she wants to do about it. Why would a mild-mannered Brit become a terrorist? That may be impossible to fully know, but this documentary, directed by Anthony Wonke, attempts to arrive at an answer. Through interviews with his former teachers, hostages and U.S. and British intelligence operatives, a portrait is drawn of Mohammed Emwazi, the masked executioner behind a series of ISIS videos of hostage beheadings.

Last season, the main madams were sidelined: Margaret Wells (Samantha Morton) was sent to America as an indentured servant and Lydia Quigley (Lesley Manville) was locked up in a mental hospital. Season 3 begins one year later, with Charlotte Wells (Jessica Brown Findlay) finally running her own brothel. She has a serious problem, though -- a new pimp, played by Alfie Allen, who's trying to cut himself in on her profits. Can these two get into bed together without killing each other first? Picking up where the Kickstarter-funded movie left off five years ago, this eight-episode revival of the beloved detective series puts Mars Investigations at the center of a big murder mystery: Who is setting off lethal bombs during Neptune's peak tourist season? Veronica (Kristen Bell) has several suspicious characters in her sights, including a cartel hit man (Clifton Collins Jr.), a compromised Congressman (Mido Hamada), a shifty ex-con (J.K. Simmons) and a pizza delivery guy (Patton Oswalt), who fancies himself an armchair detective. Complicating matters even further, Veronica's boyfriend Logan (Jason Dohring) wants to redefine their epic relationship before it's too late.","Every month, subscription streaming services add a new batch of titles to their libraries.

Movies,Yalitza Aparicio Is the Oscars' First Indigenous Mexican Actress Nominee,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/movies/yalitza-aparicio-roma-oscar.html,"Yalitza Aparicio had just finished her teaching degree and didn't yet have a job when the Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron held a casting call in her home of Tlaxiaco, Oaxaca, for the lead role in his semi-autobiographical drama, ""Roma."" It was actually Aparicio's older sister, Edith, who was meant to audition for the part of Cleo, a housekeeper and nanny in 1970s Mexico City inspired by the woman who had raised Cuaron. But Edith was pregnant and insisted that the shy Yalitza, who'd never before acted, try out instead. Two years later, Aparicio has just earned a best-actress nomination, the first for an Indigenous Mexican woman and only the second for a Mexican actress, after Salma Hayek's for ""Frida."" Aparicio's heart-rending and critically acclaimed debut is at once quiet and commanding, and her nomination is one of 10 for ""Roma,"" including best picture and supporting actress (for Marina de Tavira). [Read more about the nominations | Check out the full list of nominees | See the snubs and surprises.] Aparicio has also become a potent role model in a conversation about the treatment of Indigenous people in Mexico and the plight of domestic workers like her mother, whose experiences informed her daughter's performance. ""At that moment, when he offered me the role, all I could think about was that it was an opportunity to make my mother proud,"" Aparicio, 25, said Tuesday morning, speaking through a translator. She had just learned of her nomination while surrounded in a hotel room by the team that accompanies her on her press tours. ""And I assume my mom is even more proud at this moment.""

Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. Congratulations on such a remarkable debut. What was your reaction upon hearing about your nomination? I'm in Mexico and the news was so amazing, I just yelled, I just screamed. I can't sort of pin down one specific feeling. Have you spoken to your mother this morning? Not really because I've been doing interview after interview. I've barely got a chance to say hi to my mom, and so I'm hoping to talk to her again. I did get a chance to talk to my sister, who congratulated me and told me it's great what I'm doing and that I should continue moving forward with this. ""Roma"" has set off a sometimes heated conversation about ethnicity, inequality and socioeconomic division in Mexico. What do you hope will be accomplished by your nomination?

In December, Mexico's Supreme Court ruled that the more than 2 million domestic workers must have access to the country's social security system. And the new president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed to work on behalf of the poor and marginalized. Do you feel like you've played a role in some of this forward momentum? I really don't think I could say if I've played any role in these changes, but I do think that this role that Alfonso gave me, and his focus on my character in his film, has really turned attention to the plight of domestic workers and raised people's awareness that they need to be treated better and that they are due certain rights. What changes do you hope that this movie will help bring about for women like your mother? First of all, that their wages be fair wages for the kinds of hours that they work. Many of them start very early in the morning and then [finish their days] very late at night, and their wages don't really reflect that. So the fact that the wages would be fairer would be something that I would look forward to seeing. And this other change about them receiving social security is really important. In December, you became the first woman of Indigenous descent to appear on the cover of Vogue Mexico in its 20-year history. Its editor in chief said she'd worried because of the racist and classist reactions that your photos received in Vanity Fair -- and yet your Vogue appearance was celebrated with the magazine's largest-ever social media response. I was very happy and honored to be part of this cover, and I think that the amazing reaction that the cover got just went to show how deeply the public is ready for this kind of diversity to be present in the media.

Are you recognized in public now? Yes, some people do recognize me, and some other people approach me and ask me if it's me. [Laughs] It's actually really quite strange when that happens and oftentimes what I feel the most is a little bit embarrassed because I don't quite get it. I don't quite understand the attention. I have not been offered anything yet. I would be very open to continue acting, but even if I weren't to continue acting, I would be very grateful for this opportunity and this experience. You were overlooked by the Golden Globes and SAG Awards, and yet now find yourself in a category alongside Glenn Close, Olivia Colman, Lady Gaga and Melissa McCarthy. Is this a pinch-me moment? I feel incredibly honored because I truly did not expect it, and it's just very rewarding to see myself surrounded by these other women in this category. How are you going to celebrate? I haven't had really time to think about how I'm going to celebrate! Any idea yet as to whom your Oscar date will be? I would love for it to be my mother. It remains to be seen whether we can really do this and whether she can really travel. But I would love for it to be my mom.","Up for an Academy Award for ""Roma,"" she says the honor shows ""you're not limited by your race or your class or your ethnicity or your socioeconomic conditions.""",6a1282e0-d609-5e73-b45e-00c96dad3920,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/20/arts/22oscar-aparicio1/20yalitza-aparicio3SUB-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=9f05be3d8687c19d2f82a169ac709e235fc51d73c523012d13f5994672ba6bcb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Yalitza Aparicio, a first-time actress and now a first-time Oscar nominee.",6a1282e0-d609-5e73-b45e-00c96dad3920,N24News/imgs/6a1282e0-d609-5e73-b45e-00c96dad3920.jpg,5
Style,TikTok Mansions Are Publicly Traded Now,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/20/style/clubhouse-tiktok-tongji-west-of-hudson.html,"A business trying to make money off mansions full of TikTok influencers has gone public on the stock market through an unusual deal. It involves a former Chinese health care company, and if that sounds confusing, well, we can explain. Social media entrepreneurs have rushed to find ways to make money from stars on popular platforms like TikTok. West of Hudson Group, for one, operates a network of content houses where many prominent young influencers live. Houses like these function as management companies, taking a percentage of revenue from the creators living in them. The influencers often don't pay rent, but produce content for brands and promote products as a form of in-kind rent. Dozens of influencer houses have arrived in the Los Angeles area over the last year, and the companies that run them have been searching for sustainable business models. Going public, though, is a new strategy.

West of Hudson was acquired this week by Tongji Healthcare Group, an entity in Las Vegas that was incorporated by a Chinese hospital in 2006 but had no assets at the end of 2019. The deal was a reverse takeover, in which a private company (in this case, West of Hudson) is acquired by an already-public one (Tongji Healthcare) but ends up in control. The deal closed on Wednesday. There were more maneuvers behind the scenes. Before the reverse merger, Tongji itself was acquired by the investors who control West of Hudson, a New Jersey real estate operator named Amir Ben-Yohanan and his business partners. What it all adds up to is that the combined company, which has applied to be renamed Clubhouse Media Group, is now listed on the so-called pink sheets market, where tiny public and often speculative companies trade. On Friday, Tongji's stock closed at $2.30, 38 percent below its August high. Extremely low priced stocks -- known as penny stocks -- are extremely volatile. While sophisticated investors may dismiss such a risky investment, inexperienced investors, many of whom are active on online trading platforms like Robinhood, have an appetite for them, and for companies in the thick of social media trends.

Influencer content houses often revolve around drama. Many last only a few months before internal conflict or a dispute between talent and management leads to their disintegration. (In July, The New York Times reported that several content houses, including the ones owned by West of Hudson, were shopping around reality shows, using drama as a selling point. None have been sold.) Clubhouse, the primary influencer house in West of Hudson's network, was co-founded in March by Mr. Ben-Yohanan, Christian J. Young and Daisy Keech, a social media influencer. Its first location, in Beverly Hills, has expanded into a network of influencer mansions including Clubhouse Next, Clubhouse for the Boys, Clubhouse Malta and Not a Content House.

It may be hard to attract investors in the public markets, however. In the first six months of the year, West of Hudson had revenue of nearly $96,000 but a loss of $983,000. Mr. Ben-Yohanan, the company's chief executive who controls 62 percent of the stock, according to a recent securities filing, provided it with a loan of just over $1 million. The company can draw nearly $4 million more from him, according to the filing, which also said Tongji said may need to raise money in the markets to finance operations and grow.

In an interview, Mr. Young said the company was looking at options for raising capital in both the debt and equity markets, but declined to give more details. According to the Tongji filing, Mr. Ben-Yohanan founded West of Hudson Properties, a New Jersey real estate company that owns or manages over $300 million in multifamily properties. He is listed as the tenant on two of the main Clubhouse properties, according to the filing, which added: ""While Mr. Ben-Yohanan intends to assign these leases to the Company in the future, there is a possibility that Mr. Ben-Yohanan may not assign these leases in the near term, or at all."" A call to West of Hudson Properties seeking comment from Mr. Ben-Yohanan was not returned. In addition to being chief executive, he is listed as Tongji's principal financial and accounting officer. Financials aside, companies associated with social media trends are proving attractive among new, young investors. Zach, a 12-year-old investor who has established a following on YouTube and Twitter, is one of many young people who have gotten into stock trading, largely by watching YouTube videos. ""There's a lot more young people in the stock market than people think,"" he said.

He trades stocks under his parents' names (they monitor his usage) using a U.K. investing platform called Trading 212. He said that he'd need to look at the company's financials before determining if it was a sound investment, but could see others his age being interested. ""For most kids who invest in the stock market, there's interest in new kinds of social media trends and companies like TikTok and wanting to invest in things like that,"" Zach said. A company that's affiliated with high-profile social media stars, he said, is ""100 percent something they'd be interested in.""","Time to learn about reverse takeovers, kids!",215ab2f6-852a-5cf6-86a8-85a8a220ed00,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/21/fashion/20CLUBHOUSE-print/20CLUBHOUSE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=536&w=1024&s=fb7e006f0eef6b903abade3d5f0a1630f4d70ee51b619c03c77d0cc7d7db7a41&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Clubhouse, in Beverly Hills, one of several creator houses operated by West of Hudson Group, which took its holdings public in an unusual deal on Wednesday.",215ab2f6-852a-5cf6-86a8-85a8a220ed00,N24News/imgs/215ab2f6-852a-5cf6-86a8-85a8a220ed00.jpg,15
Style,Remembering Lisa Adams,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/style/remembering-lisa-adams.html,"Wendi Aarons stood in her kitchen in Austin, Tex., and looked at her iPhone. She felt a sudden rush of tears. She glanced at her husband and children, who were eating breakfast. She wasn't sure she could articulate her sadness to them, so she turned to the place where she knew others would understand. ""It is hard to explain to your family why you're crying over the loss of someone you've never even had a cup of coffee with,"" she posted to her Facebook page. Ms. Aarons, 47, was sharing her reaction to the news that had whipsawed around the Internet on the morning of March 7. The prolific writer Lisa Adams -- best known to thousands as @AdamsLisa -- had died the night before at age 45, at her home in Darien, Conn., of complications from metastatic breast cancer. It wasn't just Ms. Aarons who struggled last week to justify her sadness. Throughout the socialsphere, legions of women and men stood in their kitchens, iPhones in hand, trying to make sense of a new age in mourning: the deep, personal loss felt upon the death of a stranger who had become a friend across the transom of the Internet. After arrangements were announced for the memorial service, to be held this coming Monday, people began to engage in public and private messaging on Twitter and Facebook: Are you going? Can I catch a ride?

On Tuesday evening, Delia Cabe, a freelance writer in North Reading, Mass., posted on Facebook to invite others to join in a ""virtual memorial service"" at 4 p.m. Eastern time this Monday. ""Like all of you, Lisa's loss has hit me hard,"" Ms. Cabe wrote to those seized by this complicated e-grief. Lisa was an epic connector; she didn't make friends online as much as she absorbed them whole. She let people into her world and joined theirs as well, making herself a source of comfort and advice to untold numbers who burrowed into the isolation of their computers only to find a confidante. I saw this process begin to take root in 2009, as Twitter was gaining traction beyond the early-adopting crowd. Lisa joined in February of that year. She was in remission from breast cancer and developing her voice on her blog as a writer focused on a range of topics connected to motherhood, cancer, loss and nature (she was an avid, gifted gardener). On the social network, she showed a particular interest in writers whom she would engage in chatter on Twitter and then suggest, at least among those in the New York area (since Lisa lived in a Manhattan bedroom community), a coffee or lunch get-together. Both to these local friends, and those who lived farther afield or even abroad, she would send letters in the mail. The letters took note of holidays, birthdays and new jobs. They sometimes transmitted information, often were funny (she had a wicked sense of humor and a throaty laugh) and always conveyed admiration and support. The letters bore the hallmark of her gorgeous penmanship -- perfectly slanted cursive T's and uniformly looped L's. She loved beautiful stationery and Sharpies, and she wielded them well. In the fall of 2012, Lisa learned that her cancer had returned, metastasized to the bones that she knew would provide transport to her vital organs. By now, she had noticeably gained confidence in her considerable gifts as a writer and took to her preferred media with gusto. She wrote at length on her blog and in quick snippets on Twitter about the details of her medical treatment, her long-held but growing frustration with what she and others have called the ""pinkwashing"" of breast cancer awareness, which painted a pretty picture of early detection while ignoring the ugliness of deadly metastasis, and her unconditional love for the three children she sought to raise in a normal household even as she focused on preparing them for her death.

She wrote, sometimes with anger but always with moral clarity, about the disservice to the cancer stricken fostered by ""fought to the end"" battle metaphors as well as the concepts that a positive outlook or religious devotion could outwit cellular biology. In a 2012 piece titled ""When I Die,"" she said: ""Give my children a kind word. Let them know what they meant to me. That I would have stayed forever if I could. Don't try to comfort my children by telling them I'm an angel watching over them from heaven or that I'm in a better place: There is no better place to me than being here with them."" Even toward the very end, you never knew what you were going to get from Lisa. Within the last month of her life, she tweeted: ""Have a will. Update it. Discuss wishes with family. Financial planning impt and laws change all the time. Have control over things you can."" And ""I am obsessed with leaving as little unresolved as I can. As soon as diagnosed incurable I got personal organizer to help w/projects."" But she continued to find her bits of beauty -- ""Never underestimate the delicious simplicity of cheese and crackers. #andpickles"" -- and maintained her humor: ""Gotta eye-roll: started typing 'FYI' in subject line of email to friend. Autocorrect changes to 'dying.' (To be very clear, I wanted FYI!)"" Her sharing the fullness of her experience is part of what kept rapt a large readership -- 15,000 Twitter followers at the time of her death; writers, cancer patients and caretakers, medical professionals among them. In the process, she harnessed the power and promise of social media such that a stay-at-home mom who pecked away at her iPhone and laptop from her suburban perch without the benefit of any mainstream media platform could force a national conversation about the marketing of cancer, dying and dying out loud. Her unvarnished reportage was not without its critics. I sat with her in a hospital over the course of a few terrible days in January 2014, and she told me she wouldn't be -- couldn't be -- silenced because her advocacy was the legacy she wanted to leave her husband, Clarke, and their children: Paige, 16; Colin, 13; and Tristan, 8. Lisa needed them to always know that, to paraphrase her Twitter bio, she did as much as she could for as long as she could. I became friends with Lisa in the summer of 2010, after she wrote an essay about her reaction to a memoir I had written about my late mother.

But what started on Twitter blossomed in the real world: We had lunches and coffees and playdates with the children. There were marathon texting sessions about the banalities of motherhood and life: birthday parties, school pictures, finding time for Pilates, an appreciation for caffeine. We discussed books we loved and didn't, we gossiped about other people on Twitter, we talked about dying. She said she wasn't sad for herself; she was sad for and worried about her children. They guided every decision she made and informed each word she typed. Over the last week, I have spent hours rereading her work. Words that were always powerful are now achingly poignant. The day after she died, I clicked on her ""About Me"" page for the first time. She gave a one-pager on the progression of her disease, and thanked her husband, children and doctors. She signed off: ""I'm glad you are joining me. Everything is better with a friend.""",The death of a writer who became a friend to legions through social media leaves her followers feeling a personal loss.,69661643-c59a-55ce-a1e7-36c9ddb87976,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/15/fashion/15WATER_COMBO/15WATER_COMBO-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=f3be0177811a3d109c16de04c5c3c336cdb9b1295db196a9f7f674fbf7d71a63&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Katherine Rosman, left, and Lisa Adams, who became friends in 2010 through Twitter and whose friendship blossomed into lunches and coffees.",69661643-c59a-55ce-a1e7-36c9ddb87976,N24News/imgs/69661643-c59a-55ce-a1e7-36c9ddb87976.jpg,15
Economy,New Rules for Mortgage Servicers Face Early Criticism,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/11/business/economy/11foreclose.html,"Federal banking regulators have not officially imposed their new rules for the top mortgage servicers, but criticism is already being heard. A wide coalition of consumer and housing groups is denouncing the legal agreements, which are likely to be published within a few days. The new rules require the servicers to improve their processing systems, to stop foreclosing while negotiating to modify the loan and to give borrowers a single direct means of contact. Servicers will be required to bring in a consultant to investigate complaints by homeowners who lost money because of foreclosure processing errors in 2009 and 2010. In some cases the homeowners could be compensated. The problem, said Alys Cohen of the National Consumer Law Center, is the agreements ""do not in any way require the servicers to stop avoidable foreclosures, and that is what we need.""

At the heart of the complaints by Ms. Cohen and others is whether the servicers, which are arms of the biggest banks, may be compelled to give households fighting foreclosure a better shot at renegotiating their loans and staying in their properties. The servicers argue that whatever mistakes they made in handling foreclosures -- errors that will be amply on view in a regulatory report accompanying the agreements -- they never foreclosed on anyone not in severe default. They are strongly resisting proposals to cut the debt of homeowners in default to help them stay put. The issue has wide repercussions for an ailing housing market. About four million people are either in foreclosure or near it. Some housing analysts argue that adding those houses to the abundant inventory already on the market will further reduce values for all owners and prolong the downturn. To some critics, the pending fixes are all but useless. Adam Levitin, an associate professor of law at Georgetown University who has closely monitored efforts to more tightly regulate foreclosure practices, calls it ""a sham settlement"" that is worse than none at all.

Representatives of the regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve, declined to comment. The legal agreements, which take the form of consent orders, will be signed by the 14 largest servicers, including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase. They are being published on the heels of new evidence that foreclosures are still being conducted improperly. The Washington attorney general, Rob McKenna, sent a letter last week to a group of trustees. The trustees work with the servicers in states like Washington where the courts do not oversee foreclosures. Washington law requires trustees to have a local office so borrowers in default can submit documentation or last-minute payments. In a continuing foreclosure investigation, Mr. McKenna found that many trustees were effectively invisible. In his letter, Mr. McKenna called their absence ""widespread, illegal and contrary to an effective and just foreclosure process."" Among the groups protesting the consent orders are the Center for Responsible Lending, the Consumer Federation of America and dozens of local and regional housing groups. In a letter to the regulators, the groups are asking for the withdrawal of the agreements in favor of ""specific and protective measures regarding loss mitigation, account management and documentation."" Efforts to get the servicers to change their practices have a long and not particularly successful track record. During the boom the servicers needed to do little more than deposit the checks of borrowers. That changed when defaults began to swell and borrowers called to try to work out new loan arrangements.

Servicers were ill-equipped to deal with something so complicated. Nor did they have much incentive, because in most cases the loans had long ago been sold to investors. Borrowers complained that servicers were sloppy, that they lost paperwork and then lost it again, that they reshuffled borrowers among endless personnel to no effect and that they foreclosed on the property even while supposedly negotiating to save it. These assertions were brought into sharp focus last fall after revelations by servicers that in their haste and sloppiness they had broken local laws and regulations. They imposed moratoriums while saying they were clearing up the problem, but by then a range of federal and state investigations were under way. A coalition of all 50 state attorneys general joined by the Obama administration set out to change the process of foreclosure so more borrowers could remain in their homes. The goal of the regulators was more limited. The efforts by the attorneys general to impose a broader settlement with a multibillion-dollar penalty and some provision to restructure mortgages by cutting debt are continuing, however slowly. Attorney General Tom Miller of Iowa, who is leading the effort, said a settlement with regulators ""neither pre-empts nor impacts our efforts."" The attorneys general are striving to pursue their negotiations out of the public eye so every incremental step is not open to commentary and criticism.",Housing groups have united in opposition to rules that include requiring servicers to improve processing systems and to stop foreclosing while negotiating to modify a loan.,55f60f61-76a4-5dfd-a378-bf57f43eb779,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/04/11/business/foreclose/foreclose-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=196&w=600&s=cefec8ec61741c318a0ab5f0f5de0fcf7c8e28a764ad5b810e0ebcb804570cda&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"The attorneys general John Suthers of Colorado, Lisa Madigan of Illinois, Tom Miller of Iowa and Roy Cooper of North Carolina.",55f60f61-76a4-5dfd-a378-bf57f43eb779,N24News/imgs/55f60f61-76a4-5dfd-a378-bf57f43eb779.jpg,8
Real Estate,"Moving to Yonkers, for Love",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/29/realestate/moving-to-yonkers-for-love.html,"Yonkers wasn't their first choice. It wasn't even on their radar. But when Jonathan Rios, 28, and Saul Caguao, 31, both interior designers, decided to move in together, they knew finding an apartment that made financial and logistical sense wouldn't be easy. At the time, Mr. Rios was living on the Upper West Side and working in Chelsea, while Mr. Caguao lived and worked in Stamford, Conn. Mr. Rios wanted to stay on the Upper West Side, where he had been paying less than $1,000 a month for a small, dark, courtyard-facing room in a three-bedroom apartment. ""It had just enough space to center my bed and have two small side tables,"" he said. Surely, he reasoned, someone looking for a one-bedroom in the same neighborhood with a budget of $2,300 would be able to find something at least slightly more gracious?

""What I found in that price range was the smallest and the darkest: mostly older buildings with really weird layouts; not ideal, very cramped, with stuff like diagonal walls, which is not easy to decorate,"" Mr. Rios said. ""It was more than I wanted to spend for nothing remarkable."" Mr. Caguao had never been particularly on board with the Upper West Side plan, given that it would increase his commute from essentially no time at all to a trek of more than hour involving the subway, a bus and a Metro-North train. It was around that time that Mr. Rios went to visit a friend in Yonkers, which is immediately north of the Bronx, in Westchester County. A few years earlier, his friend had bought a condo off the Greystone stop of the Metro-North line, and before Mr. Rios returned to Manhattan, they swung by the friend's brother's place at Modera Hudson Riverfront, a new development on the banks of the Hudson River two train stops closer to Manhattan. ""I'd never considered Yonkers before,"" Mr. Rios said. ""But I loved his apartment. And I found the idea of living on the river charming."" Before going home Mr. Rios stopped by the leasing office, where he learned that a spacious one-bedroom with an unobstructed view of the river would cost $2,350 a month. To move in, they would only need to put down a $500 security deposit, and they would get the first two months free.

Although Mr. Caguao had not accompanied him on the social call, he was amenable to the idea, which would mean a commute of about 40 minutes for both of them. ""He sent me pictures and I was like, 'O.K.,'"" Mr. Caguao said. They signed the lease on July 3, and the next day, a barge in the river set off a huge fireworks display, which seemed an auspicious start to their tenancy. Occupations: Mr. Rios works for Denton House, a design studio in Chelsea, and runs his own design practice, Jonathan Vincent Design. Mr. Caguao is a claims manager for Wakefield Design Center, in Stamford, Conn., a company that sells custom and handmade furniture to interior designers. 

On living outside New York City: When he finally moved to Manhattan after living in Brooklyn and Queens, Mr. Rios, a Connecticut native, said he would never leave again, ""not even to visit friends in Brooklyn."" But then he saw what they could afford on their budget in Yonkers. 

The unobstructed river view: Sold them on the apartment. But they wish that the waterfront sculpture garden outside their window did not include an enormous stone table flanked by very large, regal-looking heads that seem to be peering into their apartment. Life in Yonkers, however, was not quite as idyllic as Mr. Rios had imagined. ""When you get off the train, you only see that cute waterfront area. The rest of the city is not so cute,"" he said. ""The first time I drove with Saul from Stamford to Yonkers, we got lost in the city and I was like, 'What did I just do?'"" They also soon realized that there was not much in the way of dining options, let alone night life, within walking distance of their building. One of the few places nearby is a French-Asian fusion restaurant with entrees starting at around $30 -- a nice spot for special occasions, but hardly what they considered to be a neighborhood standby.

""In Stamford, you can go out at night; Yonkers, not so much,"" said Mr. Caguao, who moved to the United States from Venezuela two years ago. ""That's what I love about Stamford: lots of restaurants and going-out places."" The obvious alternative was socializing mostly in Manhattan, which they had already planned to do a lot of anyway. The commute to the city is faster than it would be from many neighborhoods in the boroughs. But the last train home is at 1:50 a.m., so on late nights out with friends, they either have to rush back to Grand Central or cough up $80 to $120 for a car home.","The apartment has a lot going for it; Yonkers, they're still warming to.",91f420af-d6fe-5bb0-8c08-51aade3406ac,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/04/realestate/04renters1/merlin_145035357_88e72576-ed66-4b8c-b6a3-ebad688eb110-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=3c671a3627e9770fa50a2bbefa237ebe6300b22b1c4d1be56aa4333a940ddda3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Saul Caguao and Jonathan Rios have unobstructed river views from their one-bedroom in Yonkers.,91f420af-d6fe-5bb0-8c08-51aade3406ac,N24News/imgs/91f420af-d6fe-5bb0-8c08-51aade3406ac.jpg,7
Media,Why 'Sorry' Is Still the Hardest Word,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/business/media/apology-sean-spicer-holocaust-oscar-munoz-united.html,"""I'm sorry."" Two simple words, not so simply said. On Wednesday, the public representatives of two embattled American institutions -- United Airlines and the White House -- found themselves on national television grappling with a delicate and increasingly common ritual of the corporate and political worlds: the public apology. Oscar Munoz, United's chief executive, recalled his ""shame"" upon seeing a cellphone video, shared by millions of people, of a paying passenger being violently evicted from one of his airline's flights. Face taut, voice soft, Mr. Munoz's televised prostration was a far cry from the robotic statement issued by United days earlier, expressing regret for ""re-accommodating"" a traveler. Around the same time, President Trump's press secretary, Sean Spicer, was denouncing himself as ""reprehensible"" for having favorably compared Hitler to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and referring to Nazi death camps as ""Holocaust centers,"" all while standing at the White House podium. The fine art of repentance is a skill taught in business schools and promoted by high-priced consultants. But all kinds of offenders in public life still seem to struggle with the execution. Corporations like BP and Wells Fargo have faced criticism for dawdling responses to cascading crises, while politicians from Bill Clinton to Anthony Weiner have had difficulty admitting to peccadilloes.

The key to contrition, according to public-relations experts, is projecting sincerity, humanity, and a plain-spoken demeanor -- the better to convince a cynical public. And in this age of whipsawing social media, you had better do it fast. ""The head of United should never have been allowed to take three swings at correcting and apologizing for an incident that was on more social media than Kim and Kanye's wedding,"" said Mortimer Matz, a New York consultant who has guided decades' worth of clients through crises small and large. United issued several halting statements about the plane episode, which first emerged Monday morning, before Mr. Munoz made his abject appearance on Wednesday on ABC. Mr. Matz said the airline had missed its moment. ""You've got to be a fast thinker in the digital age,"" said Mr. Matz, who will be 93 in July. Many companies now take steps to be nimble and responsive when a furor erupts online. Last week, Pepsi took less than 24 hours to apologize and retract a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign that used populist imagery to sell soda. It was a rapid U-turn that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. This week, Mr. Spicer was quick to recognize the damage done by his ill-considered remarks, which prompted immediate denunciations on Twitter as well as calls for his resignation. He appeared on CNN within hours of his gaffe, while Mr. Munoz waited two days.

Still, Mr. Spicer's apology came only after his office tried to clarify his remarks with several statements that, while remorseful, did not clearly admit error. On Wednesday, in a previously scheduled interview at the Newseum in Washington, Mr. Spicer took a new tack: no excuses. ""I made a mistake; there's no other way to say it,"" Mr. Spicer told Greta van Susteren, the MSNBC anchor, his tone notably subdued. ""I got into a topic that I shouldn't have, and I screwed up."" He added: ""It really is painful to myself to know that I did something like that.""

Mr. Munoz, interviewed on ""Good Morning America"" on Wednesday, was similarly solemn. ""That shame and embarrassment was pretty palpable for me,"" he told the correspondent Rebecca Jarvis, emotion in his voice. ""This can never -- will never -- happen again on a United Airlines flight. That's my premise and that's my promise."" Later on Wednesday, United said it would refund the fares of all passengers on the affected flight.
* Retail earnings and Black Friday: the week in business.
* Elizabeth Holmes will resume her testimony in her fraud trial. Both Mr. Munoz, who was named ""communicator of the year"" by PR Week magazine last month, and Mr. Spicer took pains to personalize their apologies. It's a technique that, conscious or not, is recommended by crisis experts. ""That's on me, I have to fix that,"" Mr. Munoz said when asked about the airline policies that led to the violent ejection. Mr. Spicer described his blunder as ""mine to own, mine to apologize for, mine to ask forgiveness for.""

That plead-no-contest approach, consultants say, is one of the few ways to start rebuilding trust. The accounting firm PwC, for instance, gave a detailed explanation, and quick apology, for this year's Oscar best picture fiasco, eventually holding onto its Academy Awards account. ""People want someone to throw the book at,"" said Katie Sprehe, a senior director at the communications firm APCO Worldwide. Ms. Sprehe, who studies reputation maintenance, said United had erred by not moving swiftly to mirror its customers' outrage. ""You need to speak your stakeholders' language, and coming out with P.R. mumbo jumbo, like 're-accommodate,' is the wrong thing to do,"" she said. Stu Loeser, an adviser to executives in the technology and finance industries, said that a high-profile apology must be considered in context. ""Oscar Munoz answers to more than 85,000 employees who want to know that if they were the ones caught in a viral video maelstrom, he'd back them up,"" said Mr. Loeser, who was press secretary to former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York. ""Sean Spicer ultimately answers to one person and one person only"" -- Mr. Trump -- ""someone who sees backing down or apologizing as not only a weakness, but a character flaw."" ""In both cases,"" Mr. Loeser added, ""what might appear to be an irrational series of statements that got you into trouble makes more sense, when you think about who they're actually answering to.""

Mr. Munoz ended his interview by saying he had no plans to resign. ""I was hired to make United better, and I've been doing that, and that's what I'll continue to do,"" he said. Mr. Spicer, asked by Ms. Van Susteren if he enjoyed being press secretary, said he loved it. ""I truly do believe it's an honor to have this job,"" he said. ""It is a privilege. And if you don't believe it, then you shouldn't be here."" Whether the apologies outlive the gaffes remains to be seen. Ken Sunshine, who founded the public-relations firm Sunshine Sachs, said he was skeptical. ""My rule?"" he said. ""You get one shot.""",The representatives of United Airlines and the White House both found themselves grappling with the increasingly common ritual: the public apology.,1e7505b5-8240-504e-a03b-f14f2972d717,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/13/business/13APOLOGY1/13APOLOGY1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=4ffaa6a587c4d060e7499661fffa5a2562323603ec6ebd52766505e8c3ea765d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said of his comments favorably comparing Hitler to President Bashar al-Assad of Syria: ""I made a mistake; there's no other way to say it.

Health,Researchers Suspect That Camels Are Linked to a Middle East Virus,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/health/researchers-suspect-camels-are-linked-to-middle-east-virus.html,"Writing in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, the researchers say their findings need to be verified by other studies, but meanwhile, detailed case histories should be taken of people who have had MERS to find out if they had been exposed to camels or their milk or meat.

Some researchers praised the study. Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, a virus expert at Columbia University who has been studying MERS, said, ""I think it's compelling evidence that dromedaries are infected with MERS or a related coronavirus."" The study does not prove that the animals have infected humans, he added, but he said it was plausible because people in the Middle East have a great deal of contact with camels as racing animals, pets and sources of food.

William Karesh, a veterinarian and executive vice president of EcoHealth Alliance, a group also studying MERS, said that finding the virus itself in an animal would be stronger and more convincing evidence. But he said the new research was well done and added, ""All the clues in a mystery are valuable.""",Scientists are reporting that dromedary camels from Oman and the Canary Islands show signs of past infection with the MERS virus or one very much like it.,4fd262bd-1fbc-5069-bad8-f29524a1e066,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/09/science/09virus/09virus-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=402&w=600&s=3746d36c3906bffc338ccf9853fb6c2001586dff5d3235acf2bc8dae71238d57&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Camels may be a carrier of the virus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).,4fd262bd-1fbc-5069-bad8-f29524a1e066,N24News/imgs/4fd262bd-1fbc-5069-bad8-f29524a1e066.jpg,1
Food,"When Mild Hake and Bold Asparagus Meet, Opposites Attract",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/dining/hake-asparagus-recipe.html,"When asparagus first comes into season, it's criminal not to make it the star of the meal.

Roasted with a little shaved Parmesan and lemon; seared and piled on crostini; steamed and swiped through a mound of rich, lemony hollandaise -- all are simple, satisfying preparations that show off the stalks' charms. Add some wine and crusty bread, and dinner is done.

As the season progresses, I will somewhat grudgingly include other ingredients on the plate -- proteins, for example, like fillets of hake.

Hake and asparagus are not necessarily an intuitive combination: In fact, they're practically a study in opposites.

Media,How Rolling Stone Handled Ramifications of El Chapo Exclusive,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/11/business/media/how-rolling-stone-magazine-handled-a-get-with-ramifications.html,"Several months ago, Jann Wenner, a founder of Rolling Stone magazine, received a call from the actor Sean Penn. Mr. Penn, Mr. Wenner said in an interview on Sunday, wanted to discuss something important. But he did not want to speak openly over the phone, so the two began to speak elliptically about a potential project. That vague conversation was the beginning of what eventually became an article, written by Mr. Penn, that rocked both Mexico and the United States when it was published Saturday night. It was an exclusive interview with Joaquin Guzman Loera, the notorious drug kingpin known as El Chapo, that was conducted while Mr. Guzman was on the run from the authorities after an audacious escape from a Mexican prison last year. The 10,000-word article includes accusations of cooperation between the military and Mr. Guzman's Sinaloa cartel, as well as Mr. Guzman's acknowledgment of his status as a drug dealer and his thoughts about the ethical implications of his business. Mr. Guzman, whose escape from prison -- his second -- made him one of the most wanted fugitives in the world, was caught on Friday, before the article was published.

But after its publication, questions have been raised about the ethics for the magazine in dealing with Mr. Guzman, a criminal being sought on charges of drug trafficking and murder, and in allowing him to approve what would ultimately be published about him. The Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio, speaking Sunday on ""This Week,"" on ABC News, acknowledged Mr. Penn's ""constitutional right"" to meet with Mr. Guzman, but called the interview ""grotesque."" Steve Coll, the dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, said he was concerned by the editorial approval offered to Mr. Guzman. But ultimately, he said, ""scoring an exclusive interview with a wanted criminal is legitimate journalism no matter who the reporter is."" Mr. Wenner said that he did not think it was plausible that the magazine would become embroiled in the legal case against Mr. Guzman. ""They got their man, so what do they need us for?"" he said. ""There is nothing we can add anymore."" After Mr. Penn and Mr. Wenner agreed to pursue the article, Mr. Wenner said Rolling Stone strove for secrecy. In early October, he said, he was unable to reach Mr. Penn for a number of days. When Mr. Penn next contacted Mr. Wenner, he said that he had met with Mr. Guzman, as they had discussed previously. That meeting also included Kate del Castillo, a Mexican actress who once played a drug kingpin on a soap opera. ""It was just between me and Sean, for a couple of weeks as he wrote his draft,"" Mr. Wenner said. A lawyer for the magazine, and its managing editor, Jason Fine, were eventually brought in to help with the editing process. Work on the article was completed about two weeks ago, Mr. Wenner said, but because of Rolling Stone's production cycle, those involved were subjected to an excruciating wait for the next issue, during which time Mr. Guzman was captured.

The reporting and editing of the article were closely held, in part, to avoid the authorities. ""I was worried that I did not want to provide the details that would be responsible for his capture,"" Mr. Wenner said. ""We were very conscientious on our end and on Sean's end, keeping it quiet, using a separate protected part of our server for emails."" Around Thanksgiving, as Mr. Penn negotiated with Mr. Guzman and his intermediaries to include a video component of the interview, which was eventually sent to him by courier, the magazine was convinced that it would have to resist pressure from the authorities in the United States and Mexico who would want to learn as much as they could about Mr. Guzman's whereabouts.
* $15 minimum wage for federal contractors will take effect Jan. 30.
* Jeff Bezos gives $100 million to the Obama Foundation. ""We made sure we didn't have any information to give them, other than what we published,"" he said. ""But we would have done everything that a traditional journalism operation would have done in terms of protecting sources."" Mr. Wenner said that Mr. Guzman seemed to have become careless with those he contacted while on the run, and would most likely have been tracked whether or not Mr. Penn wrote an article. In fact, the meeting between Mr. Guzman and Mr. Penn had been monitored by the authorities, according to a Mexican official with knowledge of the operation. That led to an October raid on Mr. Guzman's compound in the state of Durango in which he managed to evade capture but which gave the authorities more intelligence about his movements. The article was edited by Mr. Wenner and Mr. Fine, with Mr. Fine responsible for the final line editing before publication. Responding to criticisms of the piece's distinctive writing style, which was mocked on social media, and its discursions into topics including flatulence and technology, Mr. Fine said: ""It's a piece by Sean Penn. Sean Penn has a particular style and point of view, and I'm happy with it."" Mr. Penn has not commented publicly since the article was published. Mr. Fine said that he, too, had considered the ethics involved with the article's publication and the magazine's arrangement with its subject. If Mr. Guzman wanted changes, he said, the magazine had the option of not publishing the piece. There is a long history of journalists interviewing subjects who were either on the run from the authorities or who were considered unsavory for other reasons. Osama bin Laden was interviewed through the late 1990s, after he had declared jihad on the United States (though before the Sept. 11 attacks). In 2013, the former basketball star Dennis Rodman went to North Korea to meet with that country's repressive dictator, Kim Jong-un, for Vice.

As for giving Mr. Guzman final approval over the article, Mr. Wenner said: ""I don't think it was a meaningful thing in the first place. We have let people in the past approve their quotes in interviews."" Mr. Guzman, he said, did not speak English and seemed to have little interest in editing Mr. Penn's work. ""In this case, it was a small thing to do in exchange for what we got,"" Mr. Wenner said. Still, critics of Rolling Stone remain unconvinced. Andrew Seaman, the chair of the ethics committee for the Society of Professional Journalists, wrote in a blog post that ""allowing any source control over a story's content is inexcusable."" The practice of pre-approval, he said, ""discredits the entire story -- whether the subject requests changes or not. The writer, who in this case is an actor and activist, may write the story in a more favorable light and omit unflattering facts in an attempt to not to be rejected."" Mr. Coll agreed that the offer of preapproval was wrong. But, he said, ""It's hard to judge what Rolling Stone was thinking since apparently the veto wasn't exercised, freeing the magazine of any dilemma."" For the magazine, Mr. Wenner said, the interview with El Chapo represented a welcome turn. It was believed to be the first interview Mr. Guzman had granted in decades. Last year, Rolling Stone was heavily criticized for a discredited article that alleged a brutal gang rape had taken place at the University of Virginia. After publication, the police, and people close to that situation, questioned the article's veracity.","After Rolling Stone magazine accepted Sean Penn's pitch for an interview with the outlaw Joaquín Guzmán Loera, communications about the project became coded.",18f07110-f4a8-5113-86a8-c3ad2e05ffe8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/10/world/americas/10ROLLINGSTONE/10ROLLINGSTONE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=7c83909ddae79a70cbfec821c2247ca43227e2227ac4257c28f04d6c00809ea6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The actor Sean Penn, left, and the drug lord Joaquín Guzmán Loera in a photo taken for interview authentication purposes.",18f07110-f4a8-5113-86a8-c3ad2e05ffe8,N24News/imgs/18f07110-f4a8-5113-86a8-c3ad2e05ffe8.jpg,16

Style,Adults in Halloween Costumes,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/style/adults-in-halloween-costumes.html,"These costumed New Yorkers -- or are they? -- got a jump on the action this weekend.

Halloween, like adolescence and the electioneering season, gets longer each year. It also appears to get older. It is now totally common in big cities to see absolutely adult-size people roaming about in costume at any hour within a two-week period. Is that a vampire on the subway, or is it your accountant?

In New York City, it's a bit jarring for the first two days. Then it becomes real tiresome. Then, as we hit costume saturation right before Halloween itself, it's totally hilarious and wonderful. You're all great!

What's it all about that many fully grown people are pleased to wander public transport in adult diapers, clutching our boxes of Scooby Snacks? Are we a town of shameless exhibitionists, or permanent adolescents? Is New York a college campus, or a community of really inventive artists? Maybe it's all of these things.

The long season of adult dress-up is a link back to Halloween's long past as a time to flirt. Inside your goofy homemade robot suit, under your basic Daenerys wig, behind your Vladimir Putin mask, you're going out to be outgoing.

As silly as you may look, you're breaking up the monotony of life -- the rotten jobs, taxes and public benefit corporations trying to run subway systems that allow and make impossible our every day. Every costume offers an opportunity for conversation. We hope you all met each other and went home safely.

Health,This Is Your Brain Off Facebook,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/health/facebook-psychology-health.html,"The world's most common digital habit is not easy to break, even in a fit of moral outrage over the privacy risks and political divisions Facebook has created, or amid concerns about how the habit might affect emotional health. Although four in 10 Facebook users say they have taken long breaks from it, the digital platform keeps growing. A recent study found that the average user would have to be paid $1,000 to $2,000 to be pried away for a year. So what happens if you actually do quit? A new study, the most comprehensive to date, offers a preview. Expect the consequences to be fairly immediate: More in-person time with friends and family. Less political knowledge, but also less partisan fever. A small bump in one's daily moods and life satisfaction. And, for the average Facebook user, an extra hour a day of downtime.

The study, by researchers at Stanford University and New York University, helps clarify the ceaseless debate over Facebook's influence on the behavior, thinking and politics of its active monthly users, who number some 2.3 billion worldwide . The study was posted recently on the Social Science Research Network, an open access site. ""For me, Facebook is one of those compulsive things,"" said Aaron Kelly, 23, a college student in Madison, Wis. ""It's really useful, but I always felt like I was wasting time on it, distracting myself from study, using it whenever I got bored."" Mr. Kelly, who estimated that he spent about an hour a day on the platform, took part in the study ""because it was kind of nice to have an excuse to deactivate and see what happened,"" he said. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Well before news broke that Facebook had shared users' data without consent, scientists and habitual users debated how the platform had changed the experience of daily life. A cadre of psychologists has argued for years that the use of Facebook and other social media is linked to mental distress, especially in adolescents. Others have likened habitual Facebook use to a mental disorder, comparing it to drug addiction and even publishing magnetic-resonance images of what Facebook addiction ""looks like in the brain.""

When Facebook has published its own analyses to test such claims, the company has been roundly criticized. The new study, a randomized trial financed principally by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, a nonpartisan supporter of research in science, technology and economics, sketches out a nuanced, balanced portrait of daily use that is unlikely to satisfy either critics or supporters of the platform. The paper, along with similar analyses by other research groups, has not yet undergone peer review. The Times asked five independent experts to look at the methodology and findings. ""This is impressive work, and they do a good job sorting out causality,"" said Erik Brynjolfsson , director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Initiative on the Digital Economy , who was not involved in the research. ""This is the way to answer these kinds of questions; it's the gold standard for how to do science. A lot of what we've heard before about social media's effects was based on surveys."" A Facebook press officer said, in a prepared statement: ""This is one study of many on this topic, and it should be considered that way."" The statement quoted from the study itself, which noted that ""Facebook produces large benefits for its users,"" and that ""any discussion of social media's downsides should not obscure the fact that it fulfills deep and widespread needs."" The researchers -- led by Hunt Allcott, an associate professor of economics at N.Y.U., and Matthew Gentzkow, a Stanford economist -- used Facebook ads to recruit participants over age 18 who spent at least 15 minutes on the platform each day; the daily average was an hour, with heavy users logging two to three hours, or more.

Nearly 3,000 users agreed and filled out extensive questionnaires, which asked about their daily routines, political views and general state of mind. Half the users were randomly assigned to deactivate their Facebook accounts for a month, in exchange for payment. The price point for that payment was itself of great interest to the researchers: How much is a month's access to photos, commentary, Facebook groups, friends and newsfeeds worth? On average, about $100, the study found, which is in line with previous analyses. During the month of abstinence, the research team, which included Sarah Eichmeyer and Luca Braghieri of Stanford, regularly checked the Facebook accounts of the study's subjects to make sure those who had agreed to stay away had not reactivated them. (Only about 1 percent did.) The subjects also regularly received text messages to assess their moods. This kind of real-time monitoring is thought to provide a more accurate psychological assessment than, say, a questionnaire given hours or days later. Some participants said that they had not appreciated the benefits of the platform until they had shut it down. "" What I missed was my connections to people, of course, but also streaming events on Facebook Live, politics especially, when you know you're watching with people interested in the same thing,"" said Connie Graves, 56, a professional home health aide in Texas, and a study subject. ""And I realized I also like having one place where I could get all the information I wanted, boom-boom-boom, right there."" She and her fellow abstainers all had access to Facebook Messenger throughout the study. Messenger is a different product, and the research team decided to allow it because it has similarities with other person-to-person media services. When the month was over, the quitters and control subjects again filled out extensive surveys that assessed changes in their state of mind, political awareness and partisan passion, as well as the ebb and flow of their daily activities, online and off, since the experiment began.

For abstainers, breaking up with Facebook freed up about an hour a day, on average, and more than twice that for the heaviest users. They also reported spending more time offline, including with friends and family, or watching TV. ""I would have expected more substitution from Facebook to other digital things -- Twitter, Snapchat, online browsing,"" said Dr. Gentzkow. ""That didn't happen, and for me, at least, it was a surprise."" On tests of political knowledge, the abstainers scored a few points lower than they did before deactivating their accounts. ""The political-knowledge findings suggest that Facebook is an important source of news that people pay attention to,"" said David Lazer, a professor of political science and computer and information science at Northeastern University. ""This is not a trivial finding. It could have gone either way. You could imagine that the other chatter and information on Facebook was crowding out news consumption."" Scores on several measures of political polarization were mixed, although one scale, called ""polarization on issues,"" dropped for the abstainers by 5 percent to 10 percent, whereas the control group remained the same. ""It's hard to know what to make of this,"" Dr. Gentzkow said. ""It may be that seeing a lot of news and politics on Facebook tends to polarize people. But once they're off Facebook, it doesn't necessarily mean they're using the extra time to read The New York Times."" Reduced knowledge, in short, may blunt partisanship, although this relationship is far from clear. The most striking result from the study may be that deactivating Facebook had a positive but small effect on people's moods and life satisfaction. The finding tempers the widely held presumption that habitual social-media use causes real psychological distress.

This notion is drawn in part from surveys that ask social-media users about their extent of use and overall moods. For instance, research led by Ethan Kross, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, has found that high levels of passive browsing on social media predict lowered moods , compared to more active engagement. But previous research could not discern whether mood problems followed heavy usage, or moody people tended to be the heaviest users. The new study supported the latter explanation . If heavy Facebook use caused mood problems, the researchers would have expected to see the moods of heavy users improve by a greater amount relative to lightweight users. But that didn't happen, which suggested that the heavy users were moody before they were sucked deeply into Facebook. In an interview, Dr. Kross said that it was too early to draw hard conclusions on the psychological effects of quitting Facebook. He pointed to two recent, smaller randomized studies that found users' moods lifted when their access to social media was restricted. ""What I take away from these three papers"" -- the Stanford study and the two smaller ones -- ""is we need to know more about how and when social-media use impacts well-being, not conclude that the relationship doesn't exist,"" or is very mild, Dr. Kross said. Thus far, the debate over the effects of social media on mental health has focused mostly on children and adolescents, not on the older population that was the focus of the new study. ""In terms of age groups, they're comparing apples and oranges,"" said Jean Twenge, a psychologist and author of ""iGen: Why Today's Super-Connected Kids Are Growing Up Less Rebellious, More Tolerant, Less Happy.""

""It is entirely possible, and likely, that the dynamics of social media and well-being are different for teens versus those ages 30 and over."" Psychologists and computer scientists have made the case that social media are addictive, and few habitual Facebook users would disagree. The new experiment provided plenty of supporting evidence: After it ended, the subjects who had quit for a month said they planned to use Facebook less, and they did so, reducing their previous habit -- at least for a while . About 10 percent were still abstaining a week later, compared with 3 percent of the control group , who had voluntarily deactivated; and 5 percent were abstaining two months later, compared with 1 percent in the control group. The financial incentives told a similar story. After the monthlong portion of the study ended, the researchers asked the abstainers how much they would need to be paid to stay off Facebook for another month, hypothetically. This time, the price point dropped below $100 -- though not for everyone. ""I told them $200 for another four weeks,"" said Ms. Graves, who has not yet returned to Facebook . ""Minimum.""",Planning on quitting the social platform? A major new study offers a glimpse of what unplugging might do for your life.

Science,How Ultra-Black Fish Disappear in the Deepest Seas,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/science/ultra-black-fish.html,"Alexander Davis admits that he can be a glutton for punishment. He staked part of his Ph.D. on finding some of the world's best-camouflaged fishes in the ocean's deepest depths. These animals are so keen on not being found that they've evolved the ability to absorb more than 99.9 percent of the light that hits their skin. To locate and study these so-called ultra-black fishes, Mr. Davis, a biologist at Duke University, said he relied largely on the luck of the draw. ""We basically just drop nets and see what we get,"" he said. ""You never know what you're going to pull up."" When he and his colleagues did cash in, they cashed in big. In a paper published Thursday in Current Biology, they report snaring the first documented ultra-black animals in the ocean, and some of the darkest creatures ever found: 16 types of deep-sea fish that are so black, they manifest as permanent silhouettes -- light-devouring voids that almost seem to shred the fabric of space-time.

""It's like looking at a black hole,"" Mr. Davis said. To qualify as ultra-black, a substance has to reflect less than 0.5 percent of the light that hits it. Some birds of paradise manage this, beaming back as little as 0.05 percent, as do certain types of butterflies (0.06 percent) and spiders (0.35 percent). A feat of engineering allowed humans to best them all with synthetic materials, some of which reflect only 0.045 percent of incoming light. (""Black"" paper, on the other hand, returns a whopping 10 percent of the light it meets.)

Now, it seems fish may come close to trouncing them all. One species profiled in the paper, a bioluminescent anglerfish in the genus Oneirodes, reflects as little as 0.044 to 0.051 percent of the deep-sea light it encounters. The other 99.95 percent, Mr. Davis and his colleagues found, gets lost in a labyrinth of light-swallowing pigments until it effectively disappears. ""I'm always arguing with bird people on the internet,"" said Kory Evans, a fish biologist at Rice University who wasn't involved in the study. ""I say, 'I bet these deep-sea fish are as dark as your birds of paradise.' And then boom, they checked, and that was exactly the case."" Super-dark skin might seem redundant hundreds or thousands of feet beneath the surface of the sea, where the sun's rays don't reach. But thanks to the D.I.Y. light cooked up by bioluminescent creatures, this part of the ocean can actually ""sparkle like the sky,"" said Prosanta Chakrabarty, a fish biologist at Louisiana State University who wasn't involved in the study. Birds, butterflies and spiders tend to use ultra-black for contrast, making vibrant patches of color pop against an extreme backdrop. Some fish may do this, too. But in a world where many deep-sea lurkers use their homemade glow to lure in prey, ultra-black may function more as a disappearing act for swimmers that don't want to be spotted, Dr. Evans said.

To suss out how deep-sea fishes conjure their cloaks of invisibility, the researchers took skin samples from nine species of ultra-black fish and analyzed them under the microscope. Like many other animals, including humans, fish pigment their skin with melanin, a light-absorbing compound stored in microscopic compartments called melanosomes. Typically colored fish scatter these pockets of pigment into a sparse, even layer held up by a protein called collagen. Any light that hits the melanin head-on is gobbled up, while light that misses the mark ricochets back toward the viewer. To maintain their stealth, the researchers found, ultra-black fishes skimp on the collagen. That allows them to pack their melanosomes together like piled grains of rice. When light contacts the clutter, what's not absorbed is deflected sideways -- straight into the path of another ravenous melanosome.

Ultra-black birds, butterflies and spiders do something similar, but perhaps in a less efficient way, said Karen Osborn, a zoologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History and an author on the study, which she began in 2014. Rather than using the same structure -- melanosomes -- to absorb and deflect light, as fish do, these land-living animals embed their melanin in mazes of bumps, boxes or spikes that bounce photons back and forth. What deep-sea fish do ""is a much simpler system,"" Dr. Osborn said. That could be a saving grace for creatures that must eke out a living in an environment as harsh and unforgiving as the deep sea, said Anela Choy, a deep-sea researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego who wasn't involved in the study. Down there, Dr. Choy said, everything ""has to do with survival: eating, not being eaten and reproducing yourself.""",Researchers have found fish that absorb more than 99.9 percent of the light that hits their skin.,e852db8a-d6d5-52fe-84cf-407abbfe0065,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/21/science/16TB-ULTRABLACKFISH1/16TB-ULTRABLACKFISH1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=30f70689b9415d941da33c251b7c957958f1c30364e4146ece02d91866d5b17a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A common fangtooth, a deep-sea species of ultra-black fish.

Opinion,"'We Will All Die One Day,' My President Said",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/opinion/coronavirus-bolsonaro-brazil.html,"For weeks now, President Jair Bolsonaro has been downplaying the severity of the coronavirus crisis; he dismissed the outbreak as a ""fantasy,"" called measures to fight it ""hysteria"" and called the illness a ""measly cold."" He spreads dangerous misinformation -- about an unproven cure, for example -- and publicly ridicules quarantine measures. He ignores statistics, scientific evidence and specialists' recommendations, as if he alone is endowed with a mysterious source of wisdom. He acts with the assuredness of fools. When in mid-March, Brazilian governors and mayors started to enforce lockdown measures, Mr. Bolsonaro accused them of falling into a state of panic. ""Our lives have to continue,"" he said, urging everyone to roll back restrictions. Later, he conceded a little ground, saying that ""we will all die one day."" Because that is the sort of statesman he is.

Luckily, most of us haven't listened to the president. In fact, few are still listening to him. My city, Sao Paulo, has been the place hardest hit by the outbreak in Brazil, and that's enough to keep us on our toes -- there's no time to pay attention to delirious statements like Mr. Bolsonaro's call for a national day of fasting and prayer to ""free Brazil from this evil."" He is becoming more isolated by the day -- figuratively, I mean: The approval ratings of his minister of health and various state governors are on the rise, while his own have plummeted.

Back in the realm of reality, the weekend came and my fever subsided, but I still had a persistent headache. I knew by then that the second week of the disease cycle was the truly critical one, when patients either improve or get sicker. I tried not to have a panic attack, since if I did, I wouldn't know how to know whether it was the disease causing shortness of breath or my intense anxiety. At this point, the country had registered 4,309 confirmed cases and 139 deaths -- 98 of them in the state of Sao Paulo.

On Tuesday, the 31st, I managed to schedule a visit with a health care provider to test me for the coronavirus. (I had to pay $73 for it.) It was the RRT-PCR test, which stands for real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; the test detects bits of viral genetic material present in respiratory secretions. The results would not be ready for a couple of days. By then, my headache had lessened to something more tolerable, and I could once again smell the sweet scent of my daughter's full diaper. I recovered my appetite (not while in proximity to her diaper, though). We resumed our mother-and-daughter sessions of crazy tap dancing on the balcony. I felt a vague sense of victory. By Friday, April 3, Brazil had 9,216 confirmed cases and 365 deaths.

Then on Saturday, the 4th, my test results came back negative. And the uncertainty came flooding back: Had it been the flu all this time? Or a false negative, perhaps? (A Chinese study has suggested that the false-negative rate of PCR tests may be around 30 percent.) A positive result would have been at least something concrete to deal with, a rare certainty amid all this coronavirus-fueled anxiety. As the days pass, I'm left wondering when or if we will get serological tests -- which detect the presence of antibodies for a specific disease -- to settle the question. I was back where I'd started, only more exhausted this time and with a (slightly improved) headache.","We live in a time of more questions than answers.

Art & Design,Artist Martin Puryear Chosen for U.S. Pavilion at Venice Biennale,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/arts/design/martin-puryear-venice-biennnale.html,"Martin Puryear's ""Big Bling,"" a 40-foot-tall sculpture looming over Madison Square Park in 2016. The multitiered wood structure is wrapped in chain-link fence and anchored with a gold-leafed shackle. The timbers and plywood create a shape both animal-like and abstract.

As with athletes who make the team at the Olympics, the selection of an artist to represent the United States at the 58th Venice Biennale next spring is a big deal in the art world. Now, at a time when museums nationwide are trying to diversify their collections and exhibitions, comes the announcement, for the second time in a row, of an African-American artist: the 77-year-old sculptor Martin Puryear. During a 40-year career, Mr. Puryear has been acclaimed for large scale works in wood, stone and metals that display strong craft traditions and explore issues of ethnicity, culture and history. Mr. Puryear's ""Shackled"" (2014), for example, is a black iron sculpture with a metal hoop at the top, reminiscent of the cuffs once used aboard slave ships. ""Martin is one of the most important artists working today,"" said Brooke Kamin Rapaport, the deputy director and senior curator of the Madison Square Park Conservancy, which commissioned and will curate the United States Pavilion at the Biennale. ""His work confronts contemporary issues and he has by now influenced generations of artists in our country and internationally."" Mr. Puryear will create new, site-specific pieces for the pavilion, a Palladian-style 1930 structure, including sculpture for its galleries and an outdoor installation in the forecourt. A spokeswoman said the artist was traveling on Tuesday and unavailable for interviews (which he typically avoids). The Biennale will run May 11 through Nov. 24, 2019.

With the involvement of the Conservancy, a nonprofit organization that programs Madison Square Park in New York, this is said to mark the first time that the United States Pavilion will be organized by an institution focused exclusively on public art. In 2016 the Conservancy and Mr. Puryear collaborated on his monumental sculpture ""Big Bling"" for that park, a 40-foot high construction of plywood and chain-link fencing with a gold-leaf shackle. ""People notice great contradiction in that sculpture,"" Ms. Rapaport said. ""It was stately and overwhelming and it was rough-hewed and it was refined and, for an artist who created work out of chain-link fence, it was significant because he chose to use a conventional urban material."" Mr. Puryear's selection was first reported by ArtNews and Jerry Saltz of New York magazine before it was officially confirmed by The New York Times on Wednesday.

The State Department is contributing a $250,000 grant toward the pavilion, as it has in previous years. The artist is selected by the nonpartisan Advisory Committee on International Exhibitions, a panel of scholars, professors, and artists convened by the National Endowment for the Arts. In conjunction with the pavilion, the Conservancy and Mr. Puryear will work with underserved youth through Studio in a School in New York and Istituto Santa Maria Della Pieta in Venice. Darby English, an art history professor at the University of Chicago, will serve as the project's exhibition scholar; Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects will serve as exhibition designers.

While African-American artists have historically been overlooked by major art museums, Mr. Puryear is one of the exceptions. In 2007 the Museum of Modern Art organized a retrospective of his work, which traveled to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. In 2015, an exhibition of his lesser-known works on paper opened at the Morgan Library & Museum in New York. The artist has also been publicly recognized, receiving the National Medal of Arts in 2011, the Gold Medal in Sculpture by the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2007, a MacArthur Foundation award in 1989 and a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1982.

Born in 1941, the first of seven children, Mr. Puryear was raised in Washington, where he attended Catholic University of America and majored in biology before switching to art. Mr. Puryear joined the Peace Corps and went to Sierra Leone, where he learned West African woodworking and basket weaving. His work retains links to tribal art. After the Peace Corps, Mr. Puryear spent two years at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm and assisted the cabinetmaker James Krenov, experiences that allowed him to investigate local craft traditions and modern Scandinavian design. Mr. Puryear's first solo exhibition was at the gallery Grona Paletten in Stockholm in 1968. He also spent time in Japan, where he expanded his knowledge of ancestral traditions like weaving and pottery. In 1969, with Post-Minimalism at its height, Mr. Puryear pursued his M.F.A. at Yale, where he was influenced by two prominent visiting instructors: Robert Morris and Richard Serra, Minimalist sculptors who wanted viewers to ""experience"" their work in an encompassing, physical way.

Although Mr. Puryear once said of Minimalism, ""I looked at it, I tasted it, and I spat it out"" -- rejecting the strict geometry and industrial fabrication -- he also drew on its forms in his multifaceted use of wood. ""I actually don't think my choice of materials makes me so unique,"" Mr. Puryear told The Times in 2017. ""Sculptors still work in wood, but what may seem a bit unusual today is that my works are still mostly made by hand, by myself and one or two assistants."" After leaving Yale in 1971, Mr. Puryear joined the faculty of Fisk University in Nashville, then taught at the University of Maryland in College Park while maintaining a studio and residence in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. When a 1977 a fire destroyed many of his possessions and artworks, the artist went to Chicago, where he taught at the University of Illinois. He ultimately settled in Accord, N.Y., and went on to create large public art projects for such sites as the River Road Station of the Chicago Transit Authority, Chevy Chase Garden Plaza in Maryland, Belvedere Plaza in New York's Battery Park City and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Seattle. Among Mr. Puryear's best-known works is ""Ladder for Booker T. Washington"" (1996), a serpentine wood structure that seems to stretch to infinity, suggesting the long -- potentially elusive -- climb to success.

""These references seep out of his highly allusive, often poetic forms in waves, evoking the earlier Modernism of Brancusi, Arp, Noguchi and Duchamp, but also carpentry, basket weaving, African sculpture and the building of shelter and ships,"" she added. ""His work slows you down and makes you consider its every detail as physical fact, artistic choice and purveyor of meaning."" He has also often revisited the soft Phrygian cap, which became a symbol of anti-loyalist resistance during the French Revolution. With ""Big Phrygian"" (2010-2014), Mr. Puryear created the cap writ large, as a five-foot-tall, red cedar-wood rendition. ""The Phrygian cap represents a brief preoccupation of mine,"" Mr. Puryear told The Times last year. ""I noticed that it seems to have been a signifier for the idea of liberty, going back to ancient Greece, but also during the French and American revolutions."" In the publication accompanying Mr. Puryear's solo show at London's Parasol unit foundation for contemporary art, the art historian Robert Storr wrote that the history of the African diaspora ""is profoundly ingrained or, more accurately, meticulously bundled by the artist into much if not all of his work, without the artist or the work ever become preachy or 'teachy.'"" To be sure, even as Mr. Puryear's work challenges viewers to consider weighty questions of oppression and racial identity, his approach is subtle, his touch light. ""What is there, and has consistently been throughout Mr. Puryear's career,"" Holland Cotter wrote in The Times in 2014, ""is work that's political, playful, sweet to the eye and deep.""",The selection marks the second time in a row that an African-American artist will represent the United States.,616cc0e0-ec8d-547e-83b8-6ef34ebefa51,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/16/arts/16venice-artist1/15venice-artist1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=201cc05582f33510fc364bf8cd9851d23d2de6e8575a11c6c9bbcd899550c594&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Martin Puryear&rsquo;s &ldquo;Big Bling,&rdquo; a 40-foot-tall sculpture looming over Madison Square Park in 2016.

Sports,Take the Lakers. Add Rondo and LeBron James. What Could Go Wrong?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/sports/take-the-lakers-add-rondo-and-james-what-could-go-wrong.html,"LOS ANGELES -- Rajon Rondo has had a difficult time for the Lakers. He was suspended after brawling with the Houston Rockets in the second game of the season. He proceeded to mangle his right hand not just once, but twice, requiring surgery both times while missing a total of 31 games. And in recent weeks, he has been coming off the bench for Coach Luke Walton, even as Lonzo Ball, who had been starting at point guard, continues to recover from an ankle injury. Rondo, a 13-year pro, was supposed to be an invaluable presence for the Lakers, who had otherwise surrounded LeBron James in Year 1 of the West Coast LeBron era with a cast of unproven (if promising) players and a hodgepodge of reclamation projects. Nobody thought this team would vie for a championship, but the road has been rougher than expected. In the wake of a recent two-game road trip to New Orleans and Memphis that resulted in two deflating losses and the very real sense that the Lakers could miss the playoffs, Walton approached Rondo for a quiet conversation. Walton wanted to put him back in the starting lineup for Wednesday's game against the Pelicans, and Rondo was on board with the plan. After all, what did the Lakers have to lose? Aside from losing another game that they desperately needed to win.

""We sat there and talked,"" Walton said. ""He's been fine with his role. He wants to play more -- everyone wants to play more. But he hasn't been complaining or anything like that. But our conversation was one of: 'Let's talk about what we need to do. How do we get back on track?' It was an honest conversation. It was healthy and positive."" As far as confidence-building exercises go, the Lakers' subsequent 125-119 victory over the Pelicans was not necessarily Grade A material. The Pelicans have their own issues, and their star center Anthony Davis, who had hoped to be playing for the Lakers after this month's trade deadline, was on a strict minutes limit as the Pelicans eye a summer sweepstakes for his services. (They would like to keep his limbs intact in the meantime.) But Walton's favorite verb after the game was ""need,"" as in the Lakers needed the win and needed some positive vibes. Sure enough, Rondo helped a great deal, finishing with 16 assists, 11 points and 7 rebounds in 37 minutes. ""I'm very confident in what Rondo has done in this league,"" Walton said. ""He's struggled a little bit, but some of that's on me. His minutes have been down. We've been trying to find different groups to work. But he's proven over his career that when he gets an opportunity, he shows up to play.""

Rondo was not particularly adept from the perimeter, shooting 5 of 15 from the field, and Davis feasted on the Lakers' smaller lineup when he was on the court. Walton knows those could be more pressing issues against better teams. But for one night, the Lakers (30-31) allowed themselves to savor some hard-earned momentum -- because it might not last. The Lakers, who have been hindered this season by injuries and trade-deadline intrigue, are not a great basketball team. The question is whether they are merely mediocre, with a chance of still making the playoffs, or not very good at all, in which case they will have wasted their first year with James on the roster. It hardly helps that the Lakers have one of the league's most difficult schedules the rest of the way, starting Friday when they host the Milwaukee Bucks, who improved to 47-14 on Wednesday with a win against the Sacramento Kings. The Lakers' coming schedule also includes meetings with playoff-bound teams like the Denver Nuggets and the Toronto Raptors. ""Every day is going to be its own challenge,"" James said, adding: ""Just try to stay positive throughout whatever's going on."" Rondo had experienced his own set of challenges ahead of Wednesday's game. He was coming off a pair of dreadful performances during the team's recent two-game trip, averaging 4.5 points and 2 assists off the bench while shooting 36.4 percent from the field. He was a nonfactor, or perhaps even a net negative. ""I didn't have the rhythm on both ends of the floor,"" Rondo said. ""That's why we have 82 games.

Education,How the Pandemic Is Affecting What Babies and Toddlers Learn,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/education/learning/babies-toddlers-pandemic.html,"Sloane Stephens, 17 months old, enjoys the online Songs for Seeds program, but her mother worries that she isn't getting enough face time with peers to be prepared for preschool.





This article is part of our latest Learning special report, which focuses on ways that remote learning will shape the future. With all the talk of remote learning for secondary schools and colleges, one important population is missing from the nationwide conversation about learning during the pandemic: babies and toddlers. Many parents are keeping their little ones away from playgrounds, playgroups and preschool preparatory programs. As a result, the social and learning opportunities for the youngest children have been curtailed, just like everyone else's. Those who study and work with the youngest children are concerned about the effects on learning and school readiness.

""There is going to be a bit of a collective lag in academic skills and in those executive-function skills that allow a child to navigate a classroom more easily,"" the developmental psychologist Aliza W. Pressman predicted. Without group settings, ""we are missing a lot of observations, so there is going to be a whole raft of problems,"" said Patricia K. Kuhl, who co-directs the Institute for Brain and Learning Sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle. That's partly because group settings like day care, classrooms and even playgrounds are often where adults notice, sometimes by comparing children with their peers, that little ones have sensory, motor, cognitive and learning problems that can benefit from early interventions. Dr. Kuhl leads the kind of brain studies that place a $2.5 million magnetoencephalography machine that looks like a ""hair dryer from Mars,"" as she put it, on the heads of young children to map neural activity, even as the babies are awake and fidgeting.

The work of both women has taken on greater urgency during the pandemic. These last few months, Dr. Pressman has seen, and helped, families innovate to provide the youngest with more interaction, education and opportunities to learn through play. For many families, that innovation has taken the form of reconsidering screen time and digital spaces, previously a pretty big no-no for babies and toddlers. Programs from places like Apple Seeds, a New York City-based series of indoor playgrounds and early childhood programs, have been huge for parents. The company had to close its locations this spring. It quickly pivoted the most popular in-person program, an interactive music program called Songs for Seeds, into a digital offering with live 45-minute Zoom sessions offered several times a week for a monthly fee of $25. Babies and toddlers can see not only the musician-teachers, but also, critically, one another.

On a Wednesday morning this fall, Lizzy and Kit Benz took a makeshift stage in front of a kitchen-concealing curtain at their home in the Astoria neighborhood of Queens with a keyboard and guitar in hand. ""Can we all clap our hands to the beat? Let's clap our hands and stomp our feet!"" they sang to kick off the program of original songs and call-and-response stage patter, in which the duo encouraged audience members (often by name) to name colors, shout out shapes, count and make animal sounds and movements.

""Manipulating objects like musical instruments builds motor skills,"" said Alison Qualter Berna, a co-founder of Apple Seeds. She added that making animal sounds and movements at the same time uses two parts of the brain simultaneously and encourages neural network connections; recognizing shapes is a precursor to recognizing and writing the alphabet; naming colors helps toddlers learn to describe their world in words; and understanding numbers is the basis of mathematical thinking. For the youngest children, like Sloane Stephens, who is 17 months, the most basic lesson is to follow along. Clad in a baby Rolling Stones T-shirt, Sloane sucked a pacifier and clapped throughout with obvious glee.

""There are other programs like ABC Mouse, Khan Academy for Kids and Homer, but the problem is that those start at age 2,"" Sloane's mother, Maya Sharan-Stephens, said. ""So the children who are at this weird in-between space, between 1 and 2, who haven't necessarily developed the motor skills, shape and color recognition, it's hard for them."" Since the spring, Sloane's family has relied on Songs for Seeds, as well as on their public library in Greenwich, Conn., which -- like many libraries around the world -- is offering story time, puppet shows and singalongs for kids online.

Still, she worries that her daughter isn't getting enough face time with peers to be prepared for preschool when the time comes. ""I see the difference when she is able to interact with other children,"" she said. Heather Superchi feared that her son, Luke, 4, was forgetting the advances he'd made socially and in speech. (Luke, an only child, has been more isolated than many other children; his premature birth has led to lingering health problems that make him at high risk for Covid-19.) ""There has definitely been a little of that regression,"" she said. But with Songs for Seeds and a My Gym franchise near their home outside Denver, she said, ""It's preparing him in the way he has to pay attention and wait his turn, which I think are going to be very important when he goes to school."" Sarah Burke, the mother of Gus Tracy, 2, said that when the pandemic first hit, ""We leaned into screen time like a lot of parents did."" Through Songs for Seeds, they noticed that Gus came alive during activities relating to the alphabet. Now, they try to recreate what Gus enjoys onscreen in their neighborhood in Brooklyn. ""So, when we go out for walks, we search for ABCs in the environment, in streets signs, license plates and other people's T-shirts,"" Ms. Burke said. In terms of language acquisition, ""I just really see things clicking for him."" Gus's alphabet city is an example of ""the good news,"" as Dr. Pressman said, that ""we can practice many of these skills in everyday life,"" including ""executive-function-based skills such as self-regulation, emotion regulation, autonomy, perspective-taking, communicating, critical thinking and self-direction."" ""You can turn almost any home-based activity or interaction into an opportunity,"" Dr. Pressman said, ticking off examples.

To encourage the sense of discovery and the ""problem solving, turn-taking and perspective-taking"" that comes from situations like ""navigating that playground moment of when you are going up a slide, and another kid wants to come down the slide,"" she advises letting children play in an undirected manner. In some homes, that may mean allowing children ""to use garages, backyards, basements or attics to find opportunities for exploring,"" Dr. Pressman said. If children encounter obstacles, allow them to work things out. That includes conflicts with siblings, though ""if you do need to jump in, help them communicate with each other,"" she said. But bath time, feeding, diaper changes and getting dressed present the best opportunities for both babies and toddlers. ""It is in those caregiving moments that some of the biggest brain boosting interactions occur,"" Dr. Pressman said. To support that, she works with the nonprofit Vroom and with Healthynest, a company that makes baby products, to provide parents with free tools and ideas to maximize such moments. And the youngest of the young are likely to benefit from extra time at home with parents during the pandemic. That's because secure attachment is the most important foundation for brain and language development. ""In fact, we may find that their language is boosted because of time spent at home with their primary caregivers,"" Dr. Pressman said. ""In some ways, babies are living their best lives.""","Without preschool and playgroups, the youngest children are missing out on important educational opportunities.",288c66d8-e1ed-57e0-98f9-6dd6748a2fd1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/18/learning/18sp-toddlers6/18sp-toddlers6-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=512&w=978&s=b04ed95ac6f7f324cb368ed13172ab61e9f27aaeebe28091144dae49ce189c05&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sloane Stephens, 17 months old, enjoys the online Songs for Seeds program, but her mother worries that she isn&rsquo;t getting enough face time with peers to be prepared for preschool.",288c66d8-e1ed-57e0-98f9-6dd6748a2fd1,N24News/imgs/288c66d8-e1ed-57e0-98f9-6dd6748a2fd1.jpg,22
Theater,Review: Betting on a Rooster in 'No One Writes to the Colonel',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/theater/review-no-one-writes-to-the-colonel-repertorio-espanol.html,"The grandest presence onstage at Repertorio Espanol belongs to the smallest creature there: a handsome rooster with luxurious plumage in fiery tones and a strikingly comfortable rapport with his principal scene partner.

That would be the human star of the show, the excellent German Jaramillo, who plays the title role in ""No One Writes to the Colonel,"" adapted by Veronica Triana and Jorge Ali Triana from the novella by Gabriel Garcia Marquez. But it is Horatius, a sweater cock, who most commands our attention -- because animals onstage are never performing in the same sense that people are, and because he seems so remarkably at home. A frightened animal is a misery to watch, but Horatius appears to trust Mr. Jaramillo. This chicken is doing just fine.

So is much of the rest of this intimate, transporting production, though the level of Mr. Jaramillo's acting is a rarity. Directed by Mr. Triana, the play is performed in Spanish and handily subtitled in English, if you want, on the seatback in front of you. (The English translation is by Jack Bustos, the subtitling by Edna Lee Figueroa.)

At 75, with an ailing wife (Zulema Clares), the colonel is retired and in desperate need of a promised pension from the Colombian government that will not come. The couple's son, recently dead, left behind the rooster, and this is where the colonel places his bet on their future.","Repertorio Español delivers an intimate, transporting adaptation of the Gabriel García Márquez novella.",7befc049-157b-5ddc-ac65-020e0412d8a8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/03/arts/03noonewrites/03noonewrites-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=d8b743f4b0342ac5661dda3dacd9a6941d320d7528559ac70613f4fd74b96afc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Germ&aacute;n Jaramillo places his faith in a rooster (and doesn&rsquo;t get upstaged by one) in the title role of &ldquo;No One Writes to the Colonel,&rdquo; based on the novella by Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez.",7befc049-157b-5ddc-ac65-020e0412d8a8,N24News/imgs/7befc049-157b-5ddc-ac65-020e0412d8a8.jpg,10
Real Estate,Filling a Family's Tall Order,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/realestate/the-hunt-filling-a-familys-tall-order.html,"FOR four years, since shortly before their marriage, Kristina Frantz and Pierre Alexandre lived in a spacious three-bedroom duplex in a two-family house in Carroll Gardens. Each of their girls -- Cielo, Ms. Frantz's daughter from a previous marriage, and baby Amelie -- had her own bedroom. The family had a backyard, a washer-dryer, a fireplace, a dishwasher and an abundance of three-prong outlets -- ""and it wasn't a four-story walk-up,"" Ms. Frantz said. The rent was around $3,200 a month. The couple toyed with the idea of buying a place. Then, late last year, they learned their building was for sale, and were forced to take action. The building needed structural repairs. And its location near the aboveground F train, which is in the midst of a long-running rehabilitation project, meant they had to endure constant construction.

""We had thick dust over everything in our garden,"" said Ms. Frantz, who works as a digital product consultant. So moving was an easy decision. In the end the house sold for $1.25 million; their price range topped out just under $1 million. The couple briefly considered a huge condominium at Lofts on Lex, at the border of Clinton Hill and Bedford-Stuyvesant, listed at $649,000, with monthly charges around $600. ""You literally could have Rollerbladed in it,"" said Ms. Frantz, who is 42. But they decided against a condominium, figuring that a building with a rental unit was a better investment.

The couple wanted at least three bedrooms, outdoor space for their dog and three cats, and an area ""where Cielo could walk down the street and get ice cream from the deli,"" Ms. Frantz said. But she preferred prewar charm while Mr. Alexandre wanted new construction. It was hard to find a place that pleased them both. In Greenwood Heights, they went to see a nicely renovated two-family house, listed for $895,000. But the building, 17 feet wide, seemed uncomfortably narrow. They couldn't figure out how to configure the bedrooms or fit in their furniture. And the neighborhood didn't have quite enough to do within walking distance. The house, which later went for $832,500, sold so quickly it worried them. ""We thought maybe when you find something you like, you need to go fast,"" Mr. Alexandre said. From there, it was back to Carroll Gardens, to a house on Dennet Place (sometimes spelled Dennett), a unique one-block street. ""The fun thing about Dennet Place is it has all these teeny-tiny doors,"" Ms. Frantz said. They called it ""Munchkin alley."" The house, a two-family for $975,000, was adorable but just too small.

But they weren't quite sold on the style of the renovation and didn't think that income from the rental unit, a one-bedroom, would be high enough to offset their costs. And then, on Red Hook's main drag, they saw a listing for a three-family being turned into a two-family. The mixed-use building included a storefront, and Ms. Frantz had a hankering to open a cafe. The price was $999,000. ""It was a mess, it was like a bomb hit it, but Kristina loved it -- she had a vision,"" said the listing agent, Mary Gaglio of Realty Collective, noting that there was a great deal of interest in the house. ""It was horrible,"" Ms. Frantz said, ""but I thought it had a lot of potential."" They met with the builder and owner, Gino Vitale, who took them to some of his finished properties and explained his plans. ""We knew he cared about preserving as much historic value as he could,"" Ms. Frantz said. The three-story house, with brick walls, original staircases and a walled-in backyard, had the right kind of ""old world meets modern convenience"" combination, she said. The couple made an offer immediately, paying $970,000, and arrived after construction was completed in the summer. They were able to customize some details, including cabinets and kitchen fixtures. They suggested a few changes, like locating the dishwasher closer to the sink.

In out-of-the-way Red Hook, transportation is a hassle, as the family knew it would be. Service on the one bus line, the B61, is scattershot, with long waits followed by several buses in a row. The bus stop is right in front of their house. If waiting passengers stand on their steps, the dog barks. The neighborhood is quiet during weekdays, with crowds coming out on nice weekends to visit Ikea and Fairway. ""Carroll Gardens has become so crowded and more anonymous,"" Ms. Frantz said, ""but Red Hook is not as anonymous. It's completely relaxed, and that's what we wanted.""",Kristina Frantz and Pierre Alexandre went house-hunting for a two-family in Brooklyn.,6a878e43-f076-5cb8-a3e8-8947be17416a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/10/21/realestate/21HUNT4_SPAN/21HUNT4_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=350&w=600&s=10abf2dacdee9ea9951fe6e85a6bb494e2fa851a8433537e938b6b02dbbf9ec0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Kristina Frantz, Pierre Alexandre and their daughters have settled in.",6a878e43-f076-5cb8-a3e8-8947be17416a,N24News/imgs/6a878e43-f076-5cb8-a3e8-8947be17416a.jpg,7
Technology,"Chasing Growth, a Women's Health Start-Up Cut Corners",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/26/technology/nurx-birth-control-pills-online-womens-health.html,"When Matt Cronin worked in customer service at Nurx, a San Francisco start-up that sells prescription drugs online, one of his jobs was to manage the office's inventory of birth control pills. The pills were kept in the pockets of a shoe organizer hanging inside a closet, Mr. Cronin said. They had been shipped to Nurx customers from its partner pharmacies, but ended up at the office when they bounced back in the mail. His supervisors regularly assigned him to mail those same medications to different Nurx customers who had not received their pills, he said. The practice was unusual. For safety reasons, federal and state laws generally require prescription medications to be dispensed through a licensed pharmacy and prohibit pharmacies from shipping returned medicines.

The closet of pills was an example of Nurx's unusual methods as it made growth a priority, according to interviews with Mr. Cronin and eight other former employees, five of whom spoke on the condition they not be named because they signed nondisclosure agreements or feared retaliation. The company is part of a new wave of start-ups seeking to upend traditional medicine by marketing prescription drugs and connecting people to physicians online who may prescribe them. Proponents of the approach say that it can significantly improve access to drugs like birth control pills. But many of these sites' practices, which merge commerce with medical care in new ways, have raised questions because the companies operate in a regulatory vacuum that could increase public health risks. At Nurx, in addition to the unorthodox reshipment of returned drugs, executives tried to revise a policy on birth control for women over 35, even though state medical laws typically bar people without medical licenses from influencing medical policy. One Nurx customer also suffered a life-threatening blood clot after taking birth control pills she ordered through the app. ""It was this mentality of 'Don't ask for permission -- ask for forgiveness later,'"" said Dr. Jessica Knox, Nurx's former medical director, who worked there from 2015 until this January.

In a statement, Nurx said that it stood by its safety record and that blood clots were a known side effect of taking birth control. With regard to shipping pills from its office, the company said it took the issue seriously and was investigating. It said the practice had ended nearly a year ago and affected a tiny fraction of the million orders it had processed since opening in 2015. Hans Gangeskar, who stepped down this month as Nurx's chief executive, said in an email that he ""did not authorize or endorse this practice."" Nurx also said it had recently hired a slate of seasoned leaders, including a new chief executive. ""There are no excuses for mistakes made by our former leadership team,"" the company said, adding that practices described by former employees did not ""reflect the current state of our team and how we currently operate."" ""We pride ourselves on being a trusted, safe health care destination,"" said Jonathan Czaja, Nurx's chief operating officer. ""That's how we're trying to position ourselves."" Kleiner Perkins declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for Ms. Clinton. Nurx was founded by two Norwegian entrepreneurs: Mr. Gangeskar and Edvard Engesaeth, now the chief innovation officer. In his email, Mr. Gangeskar said he had started Nurx to empower patients.

Together, they built an app that enables people as young as 13 to request medications like birth control pills by uploading a photo ID and answering questions about their health. One of about two dozen Nurx prescribers, including physicians and nurse practitioners, then reviews the answers and may approve drugs, which are shipped by a pharmacy. Prescribers may also deny a prescription request or ask users for other health information. Nurx said prescribers were compensated for their time, not by the number of prescriptions they write. Many women's health experts said birth control pills were safe enough to be available without a prescription. A recent study of Nurx and similar sites found they reduced barriers -- like inconvenient clinic hours -- to the pills.

""I think this is a perfect use for telemedicine,"" said Dr. Daniel Grossman, a professor at the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine and a co-author of the study. Yet in an effort to offer women more choices, Nurx executives were also trying to loosen prescribing standards, said Dr. Knox. Last year, she said, Mr. Czaja and Mr. Gangeskar asked her to revise a Nurx policy that advised its doctors not to prescribe birth control with estrogen to women 35 and older who smoked. Mr. Czaja said he and other executives wanted to leave the decision to women after informing them of the heightened risks. Birth control pills with estrogen carry a federally mandated warning cautioning against their use in women 35 and older who smoke. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also say the risks of prescribing to these women, which include stroke and heart attack, ""usually outweigh the advantages.""

Dr. Knox said that she had objected and that the company had backed off. But the disagreement lasted months, she said, and contributed to her departure. She added that medical and business decisions should be separate. ""I felt like that was eroding as time went on,"" she said. Nurx said that its executives did not control its prescribers' treatment decisions, but that they had weighed in on prescribing policies as part of the company's health-empowerment mission. ""I believe that an important part of that is to have a culture that permits everyone to evaluate and provide input to established practices,"" Mr. Gangeskar said in his email. ""Equally important is that we leave the final medical decisions to the clinical decision makers."" Some tension between the business and medical sides is good, Mr. Czaja said. ""We have lots of healthy debates around the right way to serve our patients,"" he said. In California and many other states, executives and others without medical licenses are prohibited from influencing or interfering in doctors' judgments, lest business motives skew patient care. Many states also prohibit businesses from directly employing doctors, but allow them to work with separate doctor-owned companies. Dr. Knox said the company had directly paid her until 2016, the year after the site opened, before asking her to set up a separate corporation so she could be indirectly compensated.

Nurx said that blood clots were a known side effect of such medications and that Ms. Kovaleski had been informed about the general risks of Tri-Sprintec. In a message, her Nurx doctor warned of a ""small risk"" of exacerbating her gallbladder symptoms. Ms. Kovaleski, who said she would be on blood thinners for the rest of her life, said too much responsibility had been placed in her hands. ""I guess it's scary to think that something that has such a strong potential of hurting somebody and causing death is so easily attainable,"" she said.","Nurx, an online prescribing app, drew attention with its pitch about female empowerment. Former employees said it took a laissez-faire approach to women's health.",4caf9ad7-e526-5598-9282-a97e4fdc6c2c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/29/business/29birthcontrol-print/00birthcontrol8-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=a6387acf43934af4d136bd725da1e11060e9a053f82baae7fd696834341a09af&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Nurx, which has more than 200,000 customers, may have skirted regulations meant to protect public health as it made growth a priority, former employees said.",4caf9ad7-e526-5598-9282-a97e4fdc6c2c,N24News/imgs/4caf9ad7-e526-5598-9282-a97e4fdc6c2c.jpg,20
Real Estate,What I Wish I'd Known Before Moving in Together,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/28/realestate/what-i-wish-id-known-before-moving-in-together.html,"What I Wish I'd Known Before Moving in Together

When my boyfriend, Mike DiPasquale, asked me to move in with him after two years of dating, I was thrilled. Even though I wasn't sure exactly what I was signing up for. Just the prospect of no longer needing to keep two bottles of contact lens solution, two toothbrushes and two sticks of deodorant in two separate homes was enough to have me jumping for joy. Visions of plush rugs, soft lighting and cuddling in front of a fireplace filled my head. I quickly realized that I was confusing coffee commercials with real life. The truth is: Living together before you're married is a big step legally, financially and emotionally.

My mother gave us a $100 gift certificate to Crate and Barrel, but she didn't tell me what to anticipate. I Googled ""Moving in with your boyfriend,"" but the search results landed with a thud. The advice was dry and didn't speak to my concerns: How do I know if I'm picking a compatible person to move in with? What if he's annoyed by my hourlong phone calls with my sister, the sweatpants I wear around the house, or the insane amount of hair I shed on every available surface? According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more Americans than ever are choosing to live together before marriage. And the Pew Research Center says more than half of all women aged 19 to 44 who marry for the first time have lived with their husbands before walking down the aisle. Unmarried millennials are more likely to live with their partners than any previous generation at this stage in their lives. It's clear why couples find cohabitation so appealing. Aside from the convenience it affords, the prospect of splitting rent and utility bills is too seductive to pass up. Add in a desire to shed roommates and a reluctance to renew a pricey lease, and you can see why plenty of couples choose cohabitation, even if they aren't exactly sure what comes next.

Turns out we're not alone. Most couples don't take the time to walk through the financial and legal implications of cohabitation beforehand. According to leading legal and financial experts, that's a major mistake and a missed opportunity. Frederick Hertz, author of ""Living Together: A Legal Guide for Unmarried Couples,"" says the first step toward moving in together is to figure out what will happen should you part ways: ""You can either plan your breakup in a civilized, caring, thoughtful way, or you can try to avoid it and have it be a nasty fight later on."" If you are renting or own a home, figure out who will stay in the event of a breakup. Nail down who will pay any pesky fees or taxes. Come up with a plan. In light of this practical advice, I pushed Mike to discuss what would happen if we should break up. Initially, he was reluctant to discuss the possibility. He said he'd be so devastated that he would start a new life from scratch. While I appreciated the drama of his response, we still needed to develop a road map.

Since Mike had owned his condo before we started dating, we agreed he should continue to live in it. I volunteered to move in with my parents until I found a more permanent place. I'd keep the Passat and pay the remaining payments on the lease. And Eleanor would stay with me. (I was thrilled I could keep the cat, but I didn't want to cheer too loudly.) After we settled on the details of our dissolution, we gave each other a long hug. Pam Friedman, a marital financial expert and author of ""I Now Pronounce You Financially Fit,"" agrees that the biggest mistake couples make is moving in together before having these candid talks. She advises couples to be honest about their fears and insecurities and meet them head on: What happens if we break up? Or get sick? Or die? Some unmarried couples might benefit from a cohabitation agreement, also known as a no-nup, a legal agreement about who gets what in the event of a breakup or major life event. ""You've got to think five steps ahead,"" Ms. Friedman said. ""And it's no fun at first. Then it becomes a project you can work on together."" Apart from thorny financial and legal concerns, cohabitation creates a new set of emotional constraints for couples as well.

Galena Rhoades, a professor and researcher who studies cohabitation at the University of Denver, calls it a ""sandwich period,"" when people juggle dating and marriage issues concurrently. ""When you live together,"" Dr. Rhoades explained, ""you face all the issues dating couples face -- time together, managing friends, jealousy, ex-partners -- but you also face all the issues married couples face, like household contributions, managing money together and planning for future expenditures."" It can be an especially risky undertaking if the couple immediately goes from a long-distance relationship to cohabitation. Katie Leggett and Allen Hotchkiss did just that. The couple dated for over a year while Ms. Leggett lived in the West Village and Mr. Hotchkiss lived in Chicago. Then they moved into an apartment together in Park Slope, Brooklyn. ""We knew we could get more bang for our buck if we just took the plunge and moved in together when my lease was up, versus getting separate studios, or dealing with roommates for another year in our late 20s,"" Ms. Leggett said. ""It was definitely an adjustment."" ""There were very few surprises upon moving in with each other,"" Mr. Hotchkiss recalled. ""Talking about all of the possible 'what if' scenarios is the only way to make sure living together is the right move.""

Mr. Hotchkiss is more laid back. ""For me, it was about picking the right battles and respecting Katie's key points of contention, like taking my shoes off at the door or not wearing my 'subway clothes' on the bed,"" Mr. Hotchkiss said. This willingness to meet in the middle eased the transition considerably. Mike and I slid into certain habits when it came to chores. I'm happiest food shopping, cooking meals and emptying the dishwasher. Mike prefers washing the dishes, doing the laundry, making the bed and taking out the trash. The key, says Jolie Kerr, Esquire's cleaning advice columnist and host of the podcast ""Ask a Clean Person,"" is to treat each other as teammates rather than adversaries: ""You play to each other's strengths."" We were happy to assign chores based on whoever expressed more enthusiasm. However it quickly became evident that our cleanliness standards are wildly different.

Sheena Murphy, a founder and designer at a Brooklyn-based design studio called Sheep and Stone, encourages partners to be explicit about their expectations and boundaries: ""One of the biggest things people don't do is talk about living together, what that means and how you're going to set up your home."" After a year of dating, Armando Morales and Annie Simeone decided it was silly for them both to be paying New York City rents, especially since hers was twice what he paid. Last June they figured they could make it work in Mr. Morales's apartment in Ridgewood, Queens, pending a drastic reworking of the space. Fortunately, Ms. Simeone works as a production designer for film and television. She created a rendering of the apartment and its furniture layout using a three-dimensional modeling program, which allowed her to envision various floor plans. Mr. Morales crafted custom shelving so they could save even more space. ""We have a classic New York railroad, with a kitchen on one end and the bedroom on the other. In between is an office and a living room,"" Mr. Morales said. ""It's perfect for a couple in that you can be together but also have separate space when you need it."" Another reason couples choose to cohabitate is to spend more time together. It's been interesting to see how Mike and I use that time. Like most modern couples, we are never far away from our cellphones. We're quick to browse social media at the slightest lull in conversation. I prefer to scroll through Facebook while he's more of a Twitter guy. Over time, I sensed that our willingness to plug in (and ignore each other) was affecting the quality of our interactions.

""Your partner can be a source of deep and lasting joy, connection, meaning, fulfillment,"" Dr. Carter said. ""Your phone cannot."" In the end, some of my initial concerns proved silly. Mike doesn't mind that I shed like Mr. Snuffleupagus in August. When I conduct marathon phone calls with my sister, he catches up on his social media apps. He's happy to scrub the toilet, as long as I clean the shower. We are stronger for taking this step and navigating our sandwich phase -- this premarriage, postdating bubble -- with clear eyes. Having those difficult talks about our finances and being more mindful of the space we share, the chores we perform and the habits we cultivate, we're well on our way to creating a happy home. After living together for two years -- and after countless loads of laundry and a dizzying number of dishwasher cycles -- Mike and I tied the knot on April 21, 2017. Eleanor is thrilled.","Much less planning goes into cohabitation than into a wedding, but it is, in many ways, a bigger legal, financial and emotional step.",101b78db-5453-58a6-96c7-6156c9d476b7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/30/realestate/30COHABITATION1/30COHABITATION1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=f25822edfb671904fca71d399528c96f31b2e5dbd1c82ceb5df28cc057232698&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Mike DiPasquale and Anna Goldfarb in their Philadelphia apartment.,101b78db-5453-58a6-96c7-6156c9d476b7,N24News/imgs/101b78db-5453-58a6-96c7-6156c9d476b7.jpg,7
Music,Review: A New Conductor Inspires the Orchestra of St. Luke's,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/arts/music/review-orchestra-st-lukes-carnegie-labadie.html,"Mr. Labadie is a specialist in music of the Baroque and Classical era. In Quebec he founded two ensembles, Les Violons du Roy and the chamber choir La Chapelle de Quebec, that have become first-rate proponents of historically-informed performance practice, known widely as HIP. But it's not always easy to transfer that knowledge: In 2013 I was underwhelmed by Mr. Labadie's efforts to HIP-up the New York Philharmonic's Bach.

By contrast, the Orchestra of St. Luke's includes players -- including its concertmaster, Krista Bennion Feeney -- who are well versed in the period-instrument world. With Mr. Labadie at its helm, the ensemble looks set to develop a distinct profile on the New York scene. I certainly can't remember hearing a better rendition of the opening bars of Mozart's Requiem, with claustrophobic string figures under a yearning wind chorale -- floating, evenly weighted, as on an updraft of air.

It took the quartet of soloists a while to achieve similar balance. The soprano Lauren Snouffer sounded overpowered in the dramatic beginning of Haydn's mass, her fine-grained, chiseled singing more at home in gentler moments. In ensemble numbers, the vibrant plush tone of the mezzo-soprano Susan Graham could also outmuscle Ms. Snouffer, and the strident singing of the tenor Lothar Odinius sat oddly alongside the sober elegance of Philippe Sly's bass-baritone.

Many of the most arresting stretches of the concert were those involving the excellent Chapelle de Quebec choir. But the soloists found common purpose in Haydn's ""Et incarnatus."" On the words ""sepultus est"" -- ""was buried"" -- Mr. Labadie created an exquisitely transparent texture, with the soloists' voices finely combined and just a tiny extra weight in the choir's basses adding an eerie note of mystery.","Bernard Labadie, an early-music specialist, made his debut as the versatile ensemble's principal conductor in a program of Haydn and Mozart.",2eab0952-56eb-5dcc-bab8-72ad996fa3d6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/27/arts/27stlukes/27stlukes-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=bb6c5c2c389bf1d7a5fe9c6b27aef414f41c6c8f9fb590f6e08b8bbf49ef0b02&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"In his debut as the ensemble&rsquo;s principal conductor, Bernard Labadie led the Orchestra of St. Luke&rsquo;s on Thursday at Carnegie Hall.",2eab0952-56eb-5dcc-bab8-72ad996fa3d6,N24News/imgs/2eab0952-56eb-5dcc-bab8-72ad996fa3d6.jpg,12
Books,Apocalypse Now: What's Behind the Volatile Mood of Today's American — and European — Voters,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/books/review/age-of-anger-pankaj-mishra.html,"Rousseau, the graceless outsider, could see straight through Voltaire's cosmopolitan suavity -- and he shredded him.

More to the point, he understood the underlying pathologies of the rising capitalist civilization that Voltaire championed. The market society, Rousseau warned, would dangerously unmoor individuals. He saw how humans aspired to surpass one another in wealth and status, which meant they were capable of great cruelty. The modern world weakened religion and the family, the emotional buffers that provided comfort. Without these supports, individuals came to depend on the opinions of others for their sense of self-worth, which inflicted terrible cases of insecurity, envy and self-hatred. This, in Mishra's argument, remains the nub of the world's problems: ""An existential resentment of other people's being, caused by an intense mix of envy and sense of humiliation and powerlessness, ressentiment, as it lingers and deepens, poisons civil society and undermines political liberty, and is presently making for a global turn to authoritarianism and toxic forms of chauvinism.""

There's no doubting Rousseau's prescience. His criticisms of finance and warnings about inequality are proto-Piketty. But he's a troubling hero. Isaiah Berlin called him the ""greatest militant lowbrow in history and guttersnipe of genius."" Rousseau celebrated militarism and xenophobia. He unabashedly held up Sparta as his ideal. Mary Wollstonecraft, and generations of subsequent feminists, have charged him with contributing to misogyny in its modern form. Mishra knows all this and should be far warier of his own attraction to Rousseau -- but that would require him to admit a central lapse in his own argument.

Mishra persuasively damns the arrogance of neoliberals, but let's say a few kind words for neoliberalism. On the whole, thanks to the advance of capitalism, we live in a world with less abject poverty, less disease, less oppression and greater material prosperity. Mishra dwells in the realm of ideas and emotions, which get short shrift in most accounts of global politics. So it's bracing and illuminating for him to focus on feelings, what he calls ""the wars in the inner world."" But he doesn't have much to say about the material reality of economics and politics other than angry bromides about the ""Western model"" and broad, unsupported statements about stagnation. (A sample of his glibness: He notes that ""most people have found the notions of individualism and social mobility to be unrealizable in practice."" Why then, we might ask, do so many keep trying for it?) Mishra can't find the redeeming qualities in liberal democracy and he can't posit anything to replace it with -- which explains why he must resurrect the repulsive Rousseau, brushing aside his least appealing ideas. Like Rousseau, Mishra sympathizes with traditional society. But it's impossible to defend traditional societies without accounting for their misogyny and xenophobia, which are hardly incidental features. Mishra can't bring himself to make the case, which means he has no hint of prescription for the crisis he dedicates his book to describing.

When the galleys of ""Age of Anger"" arrived, I dived for them. They slipped through the mail slot just after the Trump victory rocked my own faith in progress. Liberalism has no choice but to sincerely wrestle with its discontents, to become reacquainted with its moral blind spots and political weaknesses. Technocracy -- which defines so much of the modern liberal spirit -- doesn't have a natural grasp of psychology and emotion. But if it hopes to stave off the dark forces, it needs to grow adept at understanding the less tangible roots of anger, the human experience uncaptured by data, the resentments that understandably fester. A decent liberalism would read sharp critics like Mishra and learn.","In ""Age of Anger,"" Pankaj Mishra views today's political struggles through the prism of the Rousseau-Voltaire debates.",53fb3eea-9e7a-5754-8d7a-624bb1e99a61,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/19/books/review/19Foer4/19Foer4-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=e9d1025d481e2405f959964d4a02435c67c7bafa5a88de042c3826fba10a5913&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jeering the press at a Trump rally, November 2016.",53fb3eea-9e7a-5754-8d7a-624bb1e99a61,N24News/imgs/53fb3eea-9e7a-5754-8d7a-624bb1e99a61.jpg,13
Media,"Dave Schwartz, 63, Dies; Was Weather Channel Meteorologist",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/01/business/media/dave-schwartz-63-dies-was-weather-channel-meteorologist.html,"Dave Schwartz, a longtime Weather Channel meteorologist who early this year told his viewers about his struggle with cancer, died of the disease on Saturday. He was 63. The Weather Channel, based in Atlanta, announced his death on its website but did not say where he died. Mr. Schwartz learned he had stage 2 pancreatic cancer 10 years ago, the station said, but twice overcame it before it resurfaced last year. Often referring to viewers as ""my friends"" before giving forecasts, Mr. Schwartz presented an easygoing manner and a gentle sense of humor that made him popular with viewers, the station said. He was born on Feb. 20, 1953, in Philadelphia, where he grew up and earned a degree in psychology from Temple University. He received a certificate in meteorology studies from Mississippi State University.

Mr. Schwartz joined the Weather Channel in 1985, initially as a newsroom assistant while working for the Fulton County Health Department in Georgia. He became an on-camera meteorologist in 1991. In an online interview with the Weather Channel in March, Mr. Schwartz said he had learned of his cancer after noticing a yellow tint to his skin and eyes while applying his on-camera makeup. When a procedure to remove a tumor proved unsuccessful, doctors gave him a year to live. But subsequent treatments and a second surgical procedure were successful, and Mr. Schwartz was declared cancer-free. Months later, the cancer returned, but again treatment succeeded, in part because doctors could target a particular gene mutation found in Mr. Schwartz. (Doctors had urged him to undergo genetic testing, he said, because they knew that the mutation was more common among descendants of Ashkenazi Jews of Eastern Europe, as he was.) He was declared cancer-free again. On receiving the diagnosis a third time, in 2015, Mr. Schwartz took time off but rallied enough to return to the studio early this year and address his viewers. ""I want to let you know the reason why I have lost 35 pounds in the last five months is that I am being treated for cancer,"" he said on camera in February. ""Stomach cancer, of all things, for a foodie.""

He went on to encourage cancer patients to seek out specialized cancer-treatment centers and not to lose hope. There was no immediate word on his survivors. Mr. Schwartz, who was married, said that he and his wife had become philosophical about his condition. ""None of us is guaranteed tomorrow -- we all know that,"" he said in the Weather Channel interview. ""As far as I'm concerned, whether you have cancer or not we are all in the same boat. None of us really know that we have more time than what we have right now. So I'm no different than anyone else. I have my struggle, I have my cross to bear -- other people have their crosses to bear -- and let's hope that we wake up alive tomorrow.""","Mr. Schwartz, known for an easygoing manner and gentle sense of humor, spoke on camera this year about his third bout with cancer.",ebf92344-1696-590f-8cbf-f869f41a420e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/01/business/01SCHWARTZ-obit/01SCHWARTZ-obit-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=1d7d48a4adc47297cf3adf075b540f2b78e0b66d07401f8d376ee2471b544e96&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Dave Schwartz joined the Weather Channel in 1985.,ebf92344-1696-590f-8cbf-f869f41a420e,N24News/imgs/ebf92344-1696-590f-8cbf-f869f41a420e.jpg,16
Theater,To Warn or Not to Warn? Theater Fans Respond,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/theater/trigger-warnings-theater-responses.html,"So it turns out that trigger warnings can be triggering. We reported last week that, across the country, theaters are posting increasingly specific descriptions of content that might unsettle or offend patrons. It's a polarizing trend -- some argue that theater should be challenging, while others argue that warnings are a valuable customer service -- and our readers had a lot of thoughts on the issue. Here's an edited sampling of responses. ""This is what happens when power is handed to marketing specialists rather than artists. I prefer to be considered as a theatergoer, a member of the audience, a spectator to be enlightened, sometimes shocked, often amazed at the skill and gusto displayed."" ARNAUD TARANTOLA ""You're SUPPOSED to be shocked, surprised and confronted by drama. If you prefer milquetoast, stay home and watch cable. Theater is clearly not for you."" JOHN GALLAGHER, North Ferrisburgh, Vt.

""When I saw 'Equus' many years ago, an elderly gentleman in the theater went into shock when the actors on the stage disrobed completely. His wife, who apparently thought he was having a heart attack, started shaking him and yelling. He was fine -- he just became breathless at the sight of nudity. If we had trigger warnings in the '70s, I'm guessing that there were theatergoers who would have passed on this excellent production."" THERESA KELLY

""I think we should stop the ongoing infantilization of adults. If we can't cope with a book or a play, how will we ever cope with other adults or difficult situations?"" DVORA LEVINSON ""You've got to be kidding! Maybe hand out blankets and pacifiers, too."" NORMAN BERKOWITZ

""Movies have given trigger warnings for years, in the form of ratings. An artist has a right to shock and surprise for the sake of his art? I don't think so. Let me know generally what I'm in for and I will decide if I see it."" A THINKER, NOT A CHANTER ""I am not surprised but nonetheless saddened by some of the responses. I feel the majority of us can handle anything a theater could throw at us but this doesn't cancel out the human beings who can't. This idea that we are creating soft people or having to coddle little snowflakes -- those that hold these thoughts should try to understand the worlds of survivors of rape, torture, abuse, the minds of refugees or of the veterans we routinely send into terrible situations. What a luxury the rest of us have to walk trough daily life without memories of a nightmare lurking just beneath the surface of our daily lives."" TODD FREEMAN, Columbus, Ohio

""If it wasn't for a review in The New Yorker, I would have thought a real bomb had exploded at the Roundabout production of 'Napoli, Brooklyn' last summer. That could, of course, happen, and anyone in a big crowd of people enjoying the arts certainly has had that thought before. But since I knew it was coming, I was able to thoroughly enjoy all the shaking, noise, and 'smoke.'"" MICHAEL CUMMINGS, New York City

""Whether to warn or not is the theater's/venue's choice, and appears to be mostly a business decision based on avoiding loss of revenue. However, I trust they won't discount the buying power of patrons like me: If I walked into a venue and was greeted by a placard that gave away a tenth or third or half of what I was about to see, I would be far less likely to attend an event at that venue again."" TANYA MILLER, Oswego, N.Y.

""I think it's quite funny how 'triggered' people get about trigger warnings. Like, why so upset about something that you can just ignore if it doesn't apply to you? That being said, it deeply irritates me that the original intent of a trigger warning -- which was to warn those with PTSD about severe violence (physical and sexual), which can genuinely cause a physiological reaction for people who have experienced similar trauma -- has developed into a message of, 'This contains sensitive material that may upset you.' Being upset or uncomfortable is NOT being triggered and liberals have done a huge disservice to sufferers of PTSD by distorting the meaning."" JD, New York City ""Readers here have some strange misconceptions about trigger warnings. They're designed to help people engage with difficult material, not avoid it. The people who benefit from trigger warnings aren't weak, delicate, overly sensitive, immature or intellectually incurious; they're people who survived serious trauma, and are dealing with the fallout.""

Science,New Orangutan Species Could Be the Most Endangered Great Ape,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/science/new-orangutan-species.html,"The rain forests of Indonesia and Malaysia have long had enigmatic residents in their canopies of trees. They are the orangutans, who have always fascinated with their shocks of orange fur, remarkable vocal abilities as well as the 97 percent of the DNA they share in common with human beings. The two distinct species of the primates living on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra are surviving members of the family of six species of great apes, along with Eastern and Western African gorillas as well as chimpanzees and bonobos, which also live in Africa. But new research some two decades in the making is now upsetting that conventional scientific wisdom and suggesting that there is a seventh great ape species: the Tapanuli orangutan, from upland forests on Indonesia's island of Sumatra. An international team of scientists announced their findings in a paper published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.

""I discovered the population south of Lake Toba in 1997, but it has taken us 20 years to get the genetic and morphological data together that shows how distinct the species is,"" said Dr. Erik Meijaard, a conservation scientist affiliated with Australian National University and an author of the paper. Researchers used measurements and the overall shape of a specimen's skull, jaw and teeth, as well as genetic analysis, to distinguish the Tapanuli orangutans from two other species. Orangutans are an endangered species, with populations in some areas critically endangered. The new species, Pongo tapanuliensis, or the Tapanuli orangutan, was described as living only in an area of forest about 425 square miles in size. The team researching the Tapanuli orangutan contends that it's the most endangered of all surviving great apes, with only about 800 left. In 2013, researchers involved in conservation efforts in an area of North Sumatra province known as the Batang Toru ecosystem recovered parts of a skeleton from an adult male orangutan killed by local residents. They were surprised to find singular characteristics that consistently differed from other Sumatran orangutans, including in the measurements and overall shape of its skull, jaw and teeth, said Matthew G. Nowak, a conservation biologist with the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Program, an organization involved in the research. ""When we realized that Batang Toru orangutans are morphologically different from all other orangutans, the pieces of the puzzle fell into place,"" said Dr. Michael Krutzen, a professor at the University of Zurich and a member of the research team. Researchers then conducted what they called the ""largest genomic study of wild orangutans to date,"" comparing the genes from the recovered orangutan with data collected in the past from other field sites on Sumatra. They found that the Tapanuli population had become isolated from other Sumatran orangutan populations sometime in the last 10,000 to 20,000 years.

They also found that the Tapanuli's orangutan's lineage was ancient -- between three and three and one-half million years old -- and that they appeared to be direct descendants of the orangutan ancestors that crossed into what is now Indonesia and Malaysia from mainland Asia. ""We have learned how little we actually knew about orangutan evolution despite many decades of research and how much more there is to learn,"" Dr. Meijaard said. ""Orangutans are ancient creatures, as old as the very first members of our own genus Homo.""

The researchers acknowledged that there are limitations in their study, as they had access to only a single skeleton and two individual genomes. But they noted that other species have been defined with a single specimen. Dr. Birute Mary Galdikas, a Canadian primatologist who has studied orangutans for 46 years and led conservation efforts on the neighboring island of Borneo, said she was pleased - but not necessarily surprised - by the announcement. ""It was the talk 50 years ago, that there were two types, including one that had long fingers,"" she said of descriptions made by residents of that area of Sumatra. . ""So what they have done is solidified the evidence, using anatomical evidence and genetic evidence, and evidence from the population.""","The scientists who identified the Tapanuli orangutan said there are only about 800 left, making them the most endangered of all great ape species.",d808183c-6d62-5d80-b158-bccb59b45d90,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/03/science/03TB-ORANGUTAN1/03TB-ORANGUTAN1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=a60e8ba9cba793d1ca53a8b1faaaafbade617f7993fbe087447cfadabeec224c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"An orangutan from the Batang Toru region of the island of Sumatra in Indonesia, which researchers say is a distinct, third species of great apes.",d808183c-6d62-5d80-b158-bccb59b45d90,N24News/imgs/d808183c-6d62-5d80-b158-bccb59b45d90.jpg,2
Movies,"'Phoenix, Oregon' Review: An Ode to Small-Town Joys",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/movies/phoenix-oregon-review.html,"Bobby (James Le Gros) lives in a trailer and, when he's not bartending at a failing Italian restaurant under a cheapskate boss, is working morosely on a sci-fi graphic novel about his divorce and mother's death. Then his high-school friend and co-worker Carlos (played with crackling enthusiasm by Jesse Borrego) pitches him an idea: What if they revived their beloved old bowling joint and served Carlos's world-class Neapolitan pizzas?

A few too many threads emerge for a film of such muted, low-key realism to tie together satisfactorily: Bobby's bowling and artistic ambitions, his romance with a wine dealer (Lisa Edelstein), the betrayals of a slimy investor (Reynaldo Gallegos). On occasion the movie detours into Bobby's graphic novel, illustrated beautifully by Vince Rush, but for the most part ""Phoenix, Oregon"" is plainly made with wide shots and talky scenes. The victories of its characters are humble, and their setbacks resolved fairly easily. It's all a bit uneventful, but it works as an endearing portrait of average life: sometimes up, sometimes down, but moving steadily along.

Real Estate,Stamford Plan Hits a Speed Bump,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/26/realestate/connecticut-in-the-region-stamford-development-hits-a-speed-bump.html,"SINCE taking on the rehab of Stamford's South End waterfront in 2008, Building and Land Technology has transformed 80 mostly blighted acres into what is beginning to resemble a livable community. Building at breakneck speed, and seemingly heedless of the deep recession, the Stamford-based developer has completed 900 apartments, half a million square feet of office space, 12 acres of parkland and 4 miles of new sidewalks and roadways on the long-neglected peninsula just south of the city's downtown. Called Harbor Point, the master-planned development has attracted the likes of Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, which relocated its headquarters to Stamford from White Plains, as well as Fairway Market, which chose the location for its first Connecticut store. A private school for low-income students has moved in, and several restaurants aren't far behind. Meanwhile, nearly 1,000 more apartments are under construction, as ""even in a difficult economy, given the design of the plan, it's been very, very popular on the residential side,"" said John Freeman, the general counsel for the development group.

One of the largest redevelopments in the country, Harbor Point has been roundly cheered by city boosters for reviving an area brought low by industrial decline. But now Building and Land is testing the extent of that good will with a plan for a 124-room hotel that has roused the ire of another powerful city stakeholder, the Downtown Special Services District, or as it is more commonly known, the D.S.S.D. The group, which looks out for the downtown's economic interests, has accused the developer of overstepping its bounds. The hotel plan calls for a 4,500-square-foot ballroom, an amenity the group says would drain vitality from the downtown area. Stamford's master plan, taken together with the zoning regulations adopted for the South End redevelopment, makes it clear that full-service hotels with banquet or convention facilities are allowed downtown only, says Sandy Goldstein, the downtown district's longtime president. ""The reason is that in the downtown you have all your restaurants within walking distance and your retail shops,"" she said. ""Those zoning regulations affirmed that intense development is to happen in the downtown, and stepped-down development will happen in the South End."" Yet when the city zoning board gave site plan approval for Harbor Point several years ago, the hotel in the plan included a ballroom. Ms. Goldstein, whose group became aware of the ballroom only late last year, says she believes it was approved in error.

But Mr. Freeman says he's surprised the D.S.S.D. is making such a fuss now. ""It couldn't be more clear on the plans going back three years,"" he said. Norman Cole, the city's acting director of planning and zoning, did not respond to requests for comment. The dispute is raging as the city's zoning board considers a Building and Land application to add seven floors to the previously approved 13-story hotel plan, with the goal of creating a thinner silhouette. The next public hearing on the application is scheduled March 5. The question of how a redeveloped South End ought to coexist alongside a downtown that was itself brought back from the brink over the last decade has been sensitive from the start. Stamford is not like Manhattan, or Philadelphia, or even Boston, whose much larger populations ""can therefore support multiple downtowns,"" Ms. Goldstein said. ""We have 120,000 people in Stamford,"" she said. ""It is a very small city."" The densely developed downtown district covers just 39 square blocks, 1 percent of the geography of the city, but, according to Ms. Goldstein, with real estate that accounts for 10 percent of the city's value. When the development group that pieced together the land for Harbor Point, a now-defunct partnership called Antares, began drawing up plans, the D.S.S.D. spent some eight months in intense negotiations over what types of uses it would support in the neighboring district.

Fashion & Style,"Anahi, a Steakhouse, Is the Toast of Paris Again",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/05/fashion/anahi-steakhouse-paris-fashion-week.html,"On the Saturday of Paris Men's Fashion Week last month, all 42 seats in a tiny restaurant just north of the Marais district were full, even those in the annex bar, where a couple in black Adidases and silver Louboutins were sharing guacamole with Kobe beef bacon.

In the main dining room, lit by votive candles, a group of 15 were celebrating the birthday of YSL's studio director, while waiters in tan hide aprons circulated with wine bottles and glasses. Every few minutes, someone got up for a cigarette, but not before a petite Spanish woman wearing a leopard-print blouse and chunky earrings and drinking white wine with ice stopped them for a double kiss and a ""bonsoir, ca va?""

At Anahi, everyone knows the lady of the house, Carmina Lebrero.

Economy,Will the Coronavirus Cause a Recession? Keep Your Eye on the Barbershops,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/business/economy/coronavirus-recession.html,"Will the Coronavirus Cause a Recession? Keep Your Eye on the Barbershops

Epidemiologists are nervously tracking signs that the coronavirus is spreading widely beyond its origins in China. Economists are watching for much the same thing when it comes to the economic damage. The global outbreak has caused upheaval in stock markets and disrupted supply chains around the world. On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve took aggressive steps to try to contain the damage, announcing that it would slash interest rates by half a percentage point. So far, there have been few signs of widespread economic damage, at least in the United States. Most employers aren't laying off workers. Consumers are still spending. Shops and restaurants remain open. The Fed's move is an effort to keep it that way. Economists say a pandemic could clearly cause a recession in the United States. But for that to happen, the effects would have to spread beyond manufacturing, travel and other sectors directly affected by the disease. The real sign of trouble, said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University, will be when companies with no direct connection to the virus start reporting a slump in business.

""The key is to watch big macro numbers rather than obsessively watching things tied to virus and supply chains,"" Ms. Sinclair said. ""If people aren't getting haircuts anymore, that's a bad sign."" The coronavirus epidemic is evolving rapidly, and no one can predict the economic impact with any confidence. Instead, analysts tend to think in terms of scenarios -- what are the different ways the situation could play out? And what are the risks that existed even before the virus struck? The coronavirus will damage the economy. The outbreak has already caused factories to be closed, flights grounded and events canceled. Entire cities in Asia and Europe are nearly shut down. Apple, Mastercard, United Airlines and dozens of other companies have warned that the virus will hurt profits. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Monday that global growth could be cut in half, to 1.5 percent in 2020, if the virus continues to spread. Laurence Boone, the group's chief economist, warned that the forecast was ""not a worst-case scenario."" The United States will not be immune. Goldman Sachs estimated over the weekend that the outbreak would reduce economic growth by a full percentage point in 2020.

The economy was growing at an annual rate of only around 2 percent before the virus hit. So if the outbreak worsens, it isn't hard to imagine that gross domestic product might fall outright. But a recession is more than just a dip in gross domestic product. As most economists think of it, a recession involves a cycle that feeds on itself: Job cuts lead to less income, which leads to less spending, which leads to more job cuts. (Of course, that doesn't go on indefinitely, especially if central banks and governments intervene forcefully to kick-start growth.) ""Consumer spending being 70 percent of the economy, you are going to have to see it on the consumer side for this to take the U.S. economy down,"" said Claudia Sahm, a former Fed official who is now director of macroeconomic policy for the Center for Equitable Growth, a progressive think tank. She noted that some researchers had studied how shocks spread through the economy, using methods originally developed to model the spread of disease. Think about hurricanes or earthquakes. A bad natural disaster can easily cause output to decline in one part of the country, as stores close, shipments are delayed and people stay in their homes or shelters. A really bad one might even cause a dip in G.D.P. But barring other factors, the economy should snap back once the water recedes or the ground stops shaking. In fact, natural disasters are often followed by a temporary increase in economic activity, as people rebuild. In that way, disasters are different from financial crises, for example, which don't just reduce spending and investment in the short term but also make people and companies less willing or able to spend for months or years.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. So far, the coronavirus outbreak looks more like a hurricane than like a financial crisis -- but that could change quickly.

Then, with less revenue and no certainty on when business will bounce back, companies start laying off employees. Newly unemployed workers pull back spending further, and others, fearful that their jobs could be next, do the same. That hurts demand for an even wider array of products, forcing more layoffs and pushing some companies into bankruptcy. Or imagine a slight twist: Supply-chain disruptions make it hard for manufacturers to get parts, and for retailers to stock shelves. With nothing to sell, they have to lay off workers, setting off the same cycle of job losses and reduced spending. The common element in both cases: Once the direct effects of the coronavirus spread to the job market, the ripples reach much further into the economy. If that happens, the economy might remain sluggish even after the outbreak is controlled. ""The question is whether it pushes firms so far that they go out of business or start laying employees off,"" said Karen Dynan, a Harvard economist and former official in the Treasury Department. ""That's where you can get the bigger impacts on the economy."" Numbers will begin to tell the story. The impact of the coronavirus won't show up in economic statistics right away. Hardly any data is available from February, when the virus began to spread widely beyond China, and its effect on jobs and spending might not be clear until the spring or summer. The few indicators that are available so far paint a mixed picture. In the University of Michigan's survey of consumer sentiment, 20 percent of respondents interviewed last week cited the coronavirus as a concern, and even they were relatively confident about the economy on average. Recent surveys from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and the Institute for Supply Management similarly found that companies were nervous about the virus but that business activity was still increasing.

Such sentiment indicators could be among the first to detect trouble. Economists will also be watching weekly claims for unemployment insurance to see if layoffs are picking up and monthly retail sales data for signs that consumers are deferring restaurant meals or other spending. Measures of financial conditions, such as an index from the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, should signal whether financial institutions become reluctant to lend, another way the outbreak could slow the broader economy. One indicator that economists do not recommend focusing on is the stock market. Yes, stocks just had their worst week since the 2008 financial crisis. And yes, the evaporation (at least on paper) of some $6 trillion in wealth could cause some people to reconsider buying new cars or splurging on vacations, a phenomenon economists call the ""wealth effect."" But the stock market is dominated by multinational corporations. Its drop -- at least before a resurgence on Monday -- reflected fears of what a pandemic could mean for Asia and Europe as well as the United States. And the wealth effect, though real, isn't that big -- most Americans don't own stocks outside of retirement accounts, so the effects of a short-term drop are limited. The economy has a cushion (but not a big one). Before the coronavirus spread, hardly any forecasters expected a recession in 2020. The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low. Inflation is tame. The housing market has been gaining strength, and job growth has been steady. That underlying momentum could help prevent a recession. Businesses that have been struggling to find enough workers may be reluctant to lay them off at the first sign of trouble. Households have relatively little debt, giving them a buffer during a slowdown. But many companies have heavy debt loads, which could make it harder for them to weather any virus-induced slowdown. Business investment was already falling, and President Trump's trade war has taken a toll on the manufacturing sector. Most economists already expected growth to slow enough this year to leave the economy vulnerable. ""A lot of forecasters have been saying, 'If we were to see a recession in the next year or two, it would be coming from some external shock,' and indeed that's just what we're getting,"" Ms. Dynan said.",The Fed reduced rates to keep the effects of the outbreak from spreading to sectors not directly affected by the virus.,24c0d4d7-5432-5360-8eac-1bbed3468751,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/03/business/03recession-risks1/03recession-risks1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=775c68bd88e3f12d307e18e4473d471e86265893d5f330be0da25adc67611aa1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"There is no evidence that consumer spending, which makes up about 70 percent of the American economy, has been affected by the coronavirus.",24c0d4d7-5432-5360-8eac-1bbed3468751,N24News/imgs/24c0d4d7-5432-5360-8eac-1bbed3468751.jpg,8
Economy,France's Macron Looks to Confront Eastern Europe Over Low-Cost Workers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/23/business/economy/france-emmanuel-macron-eastern-europe.html,"Visit nearly any big construction site in France, and chances are that many employees hail from low-wage East European countries. In Britain, farms employ labor from Poland, Romania or Bulgaria when the harvest comes. Nearly half of the drivers of trucks coming in and out of Spain are from nations to the east. The principle underpinning all of that -- the freedom of citizens from European Union countries to work anywhere in the 28-nation bloc -- is a pillar of the union itself. In theory, it allows workers to move across the region to find employment and benefits businesses by providing a wider talent pool. But companies have also long profited from rules that allow them to ""post"" workers from one country to another. Now, a backlash is growing across northern Europe amid increasing evidence that employers are taking advantage of the rules to hire low-wage foreigners rather than local citizens. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, who promised to protect his compatriots from ""unfair competition"" from the east, is moving aggressively to focus attention on these posted workers as he begins a three-day tour of Central and Eastern Europe on Wednesday.

The push comes as higher-salary countries like France, Austria and the Netherlands face political pressure to curb ""social dumping,"" a widespread practice in which companies hire subcontractors in lower-wage European Union member-states and post them in a more costly one. The practice increases profit margins, but often exploits the workers by keeping their wages and social protections low. Anxiety over the rising number of foreign workers, especially from Eastern Europe, who are posted to jobs in agriculture, construction and other labor-intensive sectors was a pivotal factor in Britain's vote last year to leave the European Union. That point is not lost on politicians, including Mr. Macron, whose public-approval rating has dropped precipitously in his first months in office. In an interview with several European newspapers in June, the French leader urged Eastern Europe not to treat the bloc as a ""supermarket,"" and warned that governments would face consequences if they flouted regional values. ""Do you think I can explain to the French that businesses are closing in France to move to Poland while construction firms in France are recruiting Polish workers because they are cheaper?"" he said during the interview. ""This system does not work right."" But the charge has infuriated the leaders of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, widening a rift with West European countries that broke out during the Continent's refugee crisis, when both sides clashed over plans to distribute asylum seekers across the region.

East European leaders accuse Mr. Macron of protectionism. They question why France and its neighbors have not cracked down on employers abusing the system. They argue that their countries, which joined the bloc in 2004 during the European Union's largest single expansion, should be allowed to compete on lower wages to stoke growth and catch up. When Poland and nine other Central and East European countries joined, many older members initially restricted access to their labor markets.
* Jeff Bezos gives $100 million to the Obama Foundation.
* Stocks rise after President Biden says Jerome Powell will stay atop the Fed. On Wednesday, Mr. Macron sought to smooth the frictions, saying he wanted to push for new rules to combat fraud and to limit to one year the length of time an employee could be posted to another European Union country. His three-day itinerary includes stops in Austria, Romania and Bulgaria, and meetings with the prime ministers of Slovakia and the Czech Republic while in Austria. ""I deeply believe,"" Mr. Macron said, ""the time of the European reconstruction has come."" ""The posting of workers directive, as it functions, is a betrayal of the European spirit,"" he added, during a joint news conference with Chancellor Christian Kern in Salzburg, Austria. While posted workers make up less than 1 percent of Europe's labor force, eastern bloc leaders have vowed to fight any efforts to restrict the rights of their citizens to work across the region. The European Parliament has found numerous questionable practices used by companies to recruit cheaper labor. These include setting up fake mailing addresses in low-cost member-states and bouncing workers between several countries to avoid the increased costs that permanent employment would bring. Other companies force workers to declare themselves as self-employed so the firms can avoid paying social security contributions. The practice can easily spiral into exploitation when posted workers lack the social protections given to local hires. The host country also loses tax revenue and social security deposits to the East European countries where the workers' pay slips are based.

The workers, who were enlisted to help build a nuclear power plant run by Electricite de France, known as EDF, in Flamanville, a town on the country's northwest coast, received little to no health care coverage from 2009 to 2011, when the facility was being constructed. The employment agencies were also charged with bilking the French state of social security contributions totaling nearly EUR12 million. Last year, the European Commission proposed reforming the system to require that posted workers be paid on par with local ones, and that any posting occur ""within a climate of fair competition and respect for the rights of workers."" But Central and East European countries halted the proposals, and asked Brussels for a further review. Some member-states are taking matters into their own hands. Austria recently tightened measures to deter domestic companies from contracting low-cost European laborers. This month, the government fined an Austrian engineering group, Andritz, EUR22 million for using a Croatia-based contractor to hire around 200 Croatian workers for a EUR7 million construction project, citing a violation of national fair labor laws. An Austrian industry body has appealed, saying the government crackdown violated European Union rules, hindered entrepreneurship and jeopardized jobs in Austria.","In the wake of Britain's vote to leave the European Union, a backlash is building in Western Europe against importing inexpensive labor from Eastern Europe.",379c8cc3-3f0e-56ab-a924-28ee6b5fc28c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/24/business/24DUMPING1/24DUMPING1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=9cd31e57bcccd473f168ac868b37a60e5f999944338ec0fe62f5667a35023220&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Emmanuel Macron, center, in May as a presidential candidate, touring a glassmaker in Albi, France.",379c8cc3-3f0e-56ab-a924-28ee6b5fc28c,N24News/imgs/379c8cc3-3f0e-56ab-a924-28ee6b5fc28c.jpg,8
Movies,Inside the Scramble to Make the Oscars Shorter,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/movies/academy-awards-broadcast.html,"A rendering of the stage design for the Oscars ceremony. ""It almost comes out and hugs you,"" one producer said.

LOS ANGELES -- The lead producer of the 91st Academy Awards, Donna Gigliotti, was in high spirits on Friday morning. Serena Williams had been confirmed to appear on the telecast in a moment involving ""A Star Is Born."" Thousands of red roses for the set were en route. With nine days until showtime, everything seemed to be coming together. Officials from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences were on the line. They told her that they were bowing to pressure and abandoning their plan to shorten the ceremony by awarding four trophies during commercial breaks, with the winning moments being edited and aired later in the show. Gigliotti would have to quickly retool the broadcast so that every Oscar was presented without edits, in the traditional manner. And the officials had a question: Could she still deliver a three-hour telecast -- max? Pretty please? ""The answer was no,"" Gigliotti said over the weekend. The film academy has been fighting over how to keep the Oscars to a reasonable running time since at least 1987. The reason is simple: protecting television ratings. After three hours, academy research has shown, people on the East Coast go to bed, dragging down overall viewership numbers. People on the West Coast also move on. Three hours of watching Hollywood celebrate itself -- last year's show was nearly four, not counting red-carpet coverage -- seems to be most people's limit.

The need to rethink the telecast has become a top priority since last year, when only 26.5 million people tuned in, a drop of nearly 20 percent from the previous year. Just a few years prior, the Academy Awards had an audience of 43.7 million viewers. Every potential solution the academy has announced, however, has gone down in flames. Plans to add a category for achievement in ""popular"" film were canceled after pushback from academy members. After cries of protest, the academy backtracked on its decision to rotate a few categories into the commercial breaks, as award shows like the Tonys have done in the past. So where does that leave Gigliotti? ""It would make for a good story if I had a nervous breakdown,"" said Gigliotti, who began her Hollywood career as an assistant to Martin Scorsese and went on to work for Harvey Weinstein and Barry Diller. ""But any producer worth her salt is used to these kinds of things. You find a new way."" She continued, ""We were hired to deliver a shortened show. How do we do that so you're not seeing award, award, commercial, award, commercial, award? So boring."" Dawn Hudson, the academy's chief executive, said in an email that the organization would ""continue to discuss how the Oscars can evolve -- to keep engagement strong, to reflect the increasingly global nature of the film business and our membership."" She added, ""If we have learned anything over the last few months it is that people feel very connected to the Oscars. Everyone has an opinion and a passion.""

Gigliotti and Glenn Weiss, the telecast's co-producer and director, would not estimate how long the Feb. 24 show would stretch, except that it would almost certainly be more than three hours. But the event (aired by ABC) will still move much faster than last year, they said, in part because there is no host. After an initial choice for the job, Dwayne Johnson, was unavailable, and their eventual selection, Kevin Hart, stepped down after his past anti-gay ramblings on Twitter were rediscovered, the producers decided to go hostless for the first time since 1989.

""Ultimately we decided to try and use the host situation as an opportunity -- a way to get to that three-hour mark,"" Weiss said. Last year, for instance, Jimmy Kimmel served as host and gave an 18-minute monologue, with commentary about the #MeToo movement and jibes about President Trump. This time around, the producers expect the first award to be handed out around the six- or seven-minute mark. The producers would not say how the show would open. ""We have a very strong plan,"" said Weiss, who won an Emmy in September -- and asked his girlfriend to marry him during his acceptance speech -- for having directed the 90th Oscars. But they did disclose a few tidbits about what to expect from the broadcast. Brief presentations of the eight best picture nominees, for instance, will be ""sprinkled"" throughout the show, Weiss said. (Last year, the best picture presentations were condensed into a single four-minute montage that aired just before that category was awarded.) Eight people from outside the world of entertainment will give the presentations, speaking about what the films mean to them; Williams will give the one for ""A Star Is Born.""

""Along with inclusion, which we definitely want to embrace, the big theme of the show is about movies connecting us -- not in this theater but in a big, sweeping, cultural way,"" Gigliotti said as she walked through a chilly Dolby Theater, wearing a puffy winter coat. ""There are so many things to balance. Some viewers want to see glamour. You have to pay attention to where there is humor and where there is music. When do we guess that people at home might get up to make popcorn in the kitchen, and what can we have on right after that to bring them back?"" Gigliotti, who won an Oscar for producing ""Shakespeare in Love"" and has been nominated three other times (""Hidden Figures,"" ""The Reader"" ""Silver Linings Playbook""), said that there were no plans to incorporate regular people into the show, as Kimmel did in recent years. ""I love everyday people,"" said Gigliotti, who lives in Manhattan. ""I ride the subway with them every day in New York. Everyday people don't get me ratings."" Stars like Angela Bassett, Melissa McCarthy, Jason Momoa, Chris Evans, Awkwafina, Charlize Theron, Chadwick Boseman and Daniel Craig have been lined up as presenters. Jennifer Hudson, Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper, Bette Midler, Gillian Welch and David Rawlings will perform nominated songs. Oscar viewers will also notice a very different stage design. Instead of the over-the-top jewel box look of recent years, the proscenium is one color -- gold -- and curves and swoops like a Frank Gehry building, extending out into the theater. It was designed by David Korins, who is best known for his work on Broadway (""Hamilton,"" ""Dear Evan Hansen""). ""We wanted it to feel different,"" Weiss said from Row C in the theater, gazing upward. ""It almost comes out and hugs you,"" Gigliotti said. Work to revamp the telecast so that all of the 24 Oscars are presented live started immediately on Friday afternoon, Gigliotti said. A couple staffers were ""running around with their heads spinning around,"" she said. ""But mostly we just got to work. It's just about rebalancing the flow.""

Music,"It's a TikTok! No, It's a Song! Drake and the Viral Feedback Loop",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/arts/music/drake-toosie-slide-tiktok.html,"""Toosie Slide"" is one of a few new hip-hop songs that weren't songs first -- they were ideas spreading on social media.

Drake's new single ""Toosie Slide"" was released on Friday, but that's only if you think of a song's release in an old-fashioned way -- which is to say, a full song and an accompanying official video put out by the artist himself. ""Toosie Slide"" was truly let loose a few days earlier, when a well-known viral hip-hop dancer named Toosie posted a clip of himself and some of his dance celebrity friends -- Ayo & Teo, Hiii Key -- doing a smooth floor routine to a small section of the then-unnamed song, including the crucial dance-instruction hook: ""Right foot up, left foot slide/Left foot up, right foot slide."" The voice was Drake's, but the track was a mystery. Instantly the snippet, and more crucially the dance step, entered the slipstream of content on TikTok, where it began to spread.

Drake, who has been in a symbiotic relationship with the viral internet for almost his entire career, had commissioned the dance clip, and by the time he made it official, ""Toosie Slide"" was already a hit. In the song's proper video, Drake saunters around his Toronto mansion in a balaclava and gloves -- a socially distanced lifestyle of the rich and famous -- and is sure to hit the essential step. But there's something uncanny happening: He's participating in a scheme of his own invention, but also is just another person emulating a popular dance step, as if he weren't both the alpha and the omega.

""Toosie Slide"" sets a low bar for participation -- it's a dance song that even those who can't really dance can dance to. It is marketing stratagem first, song second. Maybe this is inevitable, though. Attention spans are shrinking, and the most effective modes of distribution favor the brief and interactive. TikTok videos end up like the equivalent of a movie trailer released before the film's completion. The platform's power goes hand in hand with the rise of snippet culture, in which sections of songs played by rappers -- Playboi Carti and Lil Uzi Vert, among others -- on social media become cult favorites, and sometimes more popular than actual hits. Increasingly, the way to cut through the clutter is to do less, and leave behind a thirst -- and an opportunity -- for more. This has been happening organically on TikTok since the app's beginning: TikTokers mine music (new and old alike) for snippets they can reinvent as short dances or comic films. Look at recent popular dances, like the one-pose-per-mood routine to Megan Thee Stallion's ""Savage"" (""I'm a savage/Classy, bougie, ratchet/Sassy, moody, nasty""), or the soundtrack to the Renegade craze: ""Lottery,"" by K. Camp -- or at least the beginning of ""Lottery,"" a song that K. Camp eventually raps on. In the case of Jack Harlow's ""Whats Poppin,"" the clips don't feature a dance, but umpteen thousands of handsome young people shamelessly flirting with their phone cameras. ""Toosie Slide"" merely anticipates the response -- why not just cut to the chase? Drake had already done this, unintentionally, with ""Nonstop,"" his 2018 song that recently became the soundtrack to one of TikTok's funniest routines -- see Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez flipping the switch and swapping outfits.

And he is no stranger to feeding the viral maw. In 2015, the ""Hotline Bling"" video, with its lush neon-tone backgrounds and easily legible dance steps and facial expressions, was engineered for the meme era, every scene a potential GIF. But less well-known artists who are savvy enough to read online tea leaves can do something similar. For them, TikTok can also serve as a test run, a way to gauge potential interest in an idea, a sound or a lyric, before committing resources to it. Such is the case with The Kid Laroi, an Australian rapper who last month posted a snippet of a song on TikTok -- ""I need a bad bitch/Addison Rae/Shawty the baddest"" -- name-checking the TikTok superstar with 31 million followers, who's been part of the dominant Hype House collective.

With everyone in quarantine glued to their phones, a strategic @ mention can reach its intended recipient, no matter how famous that recipient is. On her Instagram story, Rae filmed herself listening to the clip, surprised, and then posted a clip of herself playing it for her mother on TikTok. Eventually Laroi and Rae spoke. ""She was like, 'Is this song, like, a real song?' and I was like yeah, it is, and it wasn't, but I was like yeah, it is,"" he said in an interview with Genius. And so, in short order, it became a real song -- keyword optimized, algorithm friendly, half-cooked but just cooked enough. Most newborn rap songs from relative unknowns have just the faintest chance at survival in the harsh digital clime. But a nurturing boost from one of the most famous young women on the internet might make it last.

Choosing to name your song after someone famous is something of a gimme, however. Taking less obvious source material and reframing it into a song requires a touch more improvisational savvy. That's not a phrase one has historically associated with Tyga, a genial hip-hop hanger-on for at least a couple of generations. But quarantine has extracted something strange, cheerful and winning from him. Curtis Roach, a TikTok comedian, posted a video at the beginning of March where he eye-rollingly rapped ""bored in the house and I'm in the house bored"" while banging out a beat on the floor. It was catchy, and just the right degree of comically exasperated.

Soon after, Tyga posted a clip of himself dancing in his kitchen and spinning on his hoverboard to Roach's audio (as have around 400,000 others). Before long, he posted a second clip, more ornate than the first -- jumping from couch to couch, dancing on his pool table, washing his hands, walking like a cat on the mantle in front of his television. (Tyga has a big house, too, though perhaps not quite so Brobdingnagian as Drake's.) He'd added a beat to Roach's words -- bubbly and light, like the jerk music that dominated Los Angeles hip-hop in the late 2000s -- and in the caption, announced that he'd made a song with Roach. For the song ""Bored in the House,"" both recorded humorous verses. Tyga: ""Tell the bitch chill like refrigerator doors/We can heat up some ramen, can't go to the store""; Roach: ""Locked down, I'ma stay stayin' in-in/Ramen noodles every night for my din-din/Hulu, binge watchin' episodes of 'Ben 10,'"" and so on. It is primo comedy rap, the stuff of morning-zoo radio, and an elegant example of spinning gold from hay. Where ""Toosie Slide"" plays like a royal benediction -- the world's most savvy and influential pop musician spinning an entire digital platform on his fingertip -- ""Bored in the House"" feels like from-the-ground-up playtime.

Television,"'The Walking Dead' Season 8, Episode 13 Recap: Suffer the Little Children",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/arts/television/the-walking-dead-recap-do-not-send-us-astray.html,"Morgan senses the futility of this enterprise, however. He knows what it is.

Rick knows what it is, too. He's still stunned by his son's sacrifice, unable to speak about Carl when Siddiq approaches him with a patient ear. It's been so long since the show treated a character's death with such gravity, that seeing Rick still hurting four episodes later is a welcome reprieve from the usual depravity-of-the-week showcase. The circumstances surrounding Carl and Henry's respective demises may differ, but speaking generally, the same thing happened to both of them. They are ancillary losses, caught up in the brutal riptide of combat.

This episode couldn't have ended anywhere but a graveyard, and sure enough, Carol and Rick gaze out over rows and rows of makeshift headstones in this week's final moments. Alongside them stands Maggie, who can do nothing but lament ""the cost,"" a universal umbrella term for everything precious they've lost. (Shades of Tony Soprano grumbling, ""How could this happen?"" to an absent God as he sits by his comatose nephew.) Maggie wrestles with self-doubt even as she continues to lust for vengeance against Negan, afraid that staying the course may imperil more innocent lives and wondering how many more they can lose while still considering this war worth fighting.

Because it's not slowing down any time soon. Having last been seen riding shotgun with a very angry Jadis, Negan is out of sight in this episode, and hardly out of mind. Simon's ill-advised power grab among the Saviors has been built entirely around the shaky notion that everything he wants also happens to be what Negan would have wanted. Simon is a persuasive enough public speaker that this manipulation works, for the most part -- though maybe it's just that commanding handlebar mustache -- but that will fall apart in undoubtedly violent fashion once Negan returns.

Simon cannot be entirely unaware of this, judging by the haste with which he accelerates the Savior counteroffensive. He knows enough to wield the power while he has it, and he won't let go of it without leaving a few claw marks. The show's ""all out war"" arc can't last forever, and discord among the Saviors could be the resolution Rick's coalition (and the writing staff) have been looking for.

""I don't think it ends,"" muses Carol in the episode's most telling moment. Her words can expand to cover the entire show, from the war raging around them to the endless cycle of Pyrrhic victories and crushing defeats that has given the show's entire run an orderly shape. This episode makes the heartening suggestion that she might not be correct. Whether it's enemy infighting or a surge of energy on the home front, something has to end all the bloodshed soon. Scanning their private cemetery as if it were a D.I.Y. Arlington, they realize that it has to. They have long since given up too much.",This week's episode brought several long-percolating situations to a head.,82d67d5d-f2a5-5b20-a6ad-1a32a7ecbd5f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/23/arts/25walkingdead-recap/25walkingdead-recap-slide-82PI-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=dd236afa34377d5b246fb49fd7dd0f7fd2691a344aa19361707ccf5f4e0a16b2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Khary Payton and Melissa McBride in ""The Walking Dead.""",82d67d5d-f2a5-5b20-a6ad-1a32a7ecbd5f,N24News/imgs/82d67d5d-f2a5-5b20-a6ad-1a32a7ecbd5f.jpg,3
Health,Vast Study Casts Doubts on Value of Mammograms,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/health/study-adds-new-doubts-about-value-of-mammograms.html,"One of the largest and most meticulous studies of mammography ever done, involving 90,000 women and lasting a quarter-century, has added powerful new doubts about the value of the screening test for women of any age. It found that the death rates from breast cancer and from all causes were the same in women who got mammograms and those who did not. And the screening had harms: One in five cancers found with mammography and treated was not a threat to the woman's health and did not need treatment such as chemotherapy, surgery or radiation. The study, published Tuesday in The British Medical Journal, is one of the few rigorous evaluations of mammograms conducted in the modern era of more effective breast cancer treatments. It randomly assigned Canadian women to have regular mammograms and breast exams by trained nurses or to have breast exams alone. Researchers sought to determine whether there was any advantage to finding breast cancers when they were too small to feel. The answer is no, the researchers report.

The study seems likely to lead to an even deeper polarization between those who believe that regular mammography saves lives, including many breast cancer patients and advocates for them, and a growing number of researchers who say the evidence is lacking or, at the very least, murky. ""It will make women uncomfortable, and they should be uncomfortable,"" said Dr. Russell P. Harris, a screening expert and professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who was not involved in the study. ""The decision to have a mammogram should not be a slam dunk."" The findings will not lead to any immediate change in guidelines for mammography, and many advocates and experts will almost certainly dispute the idea that mammograms are on balance useless, or even harmful.

Dr. Richard C. Wender, chief of cancer control for the American Cancer Society, said the society had convened an expert panel that was reviewing all studies on mammography, including the Canadian one, and would issue revised guidelines later this year. He added that combined data from clinical trials of mammography showed it reduces the death rate from breast cancer by at least 15 percent for women in their 40s and by at least 20 percent for older women.

That means that one woman in 1,000 who starts screening in her 40s, two who start in their 50s and three who start in their 60s will avoid a breast cancer death, Dr. Harris said. Dr. Wender added that while improved treatments clearly helped lower the breast cancer death rate, so did mammography, by catching cancers early. But an editorial accompanying the new study said that earlier studies that found mammograms helped women were done before the routine use of drugs like tamoxifen that sharply reduced the breast cancer death rate. In addition, many studies did not use the gold-standard methods of the clinical trial, randomly assigning women to be screened or not, noted the editorial's author, Dr. Mette Kalager, and other experts. Dr. Kalager, an epidemiologist and screening researcher at the University of Oslo and the Harvard School of Public Health, said there was a reason the results were unlike those of earlier studies. With better treatments, like tamoxifen, it was less important to find cancers early. Also, she said, women in the Canadian study were aware of breast cancer and its dangers, unlike women in earlier studies who were more likely to ignore lumps. ""It might be possible that mammography screening would work if you don't have any awareness of the disease,"" she said. The Canadian study reached the same conclusion about the lack of a benefit from mammograms after 11 to 16 years of follow-up, but some experts predicted that as time went on the advantages would emerge.

Many cancers, researchers now recognize, grow slowly, or not at all, and do not require treatment. Some cancers even shrink or disappear on their own. But once cancer is detected, it is impossible to know if it is dangerous, so doctors treat them all. If the researchers also included a precancerous condition called ductal carcinoma in situ, the overdiagnosis rate would be closer to one in three cancers, said Dr. Anthony B. Miller of the University of Toronto, the lead author of the paper. Ductal carcinoma in situ, or D.C.I.S., is found only with mammography, is confined to the milk duct and may or may not break out into the breast. But it is usually treated with surgery, including mastectomy, or removal of the breast. Mammography's benefits have long been debated, but no nations except Switzerland have suggested the screening be halted. In a recent report, the Swiss Medical Board, an expert panel established by regional ministers of public health, advised that no new mammography programs be started in that country and that those in existence have a limited, though unspecified, duration. Ten of 26 Swiss cantons, or districts, have regular mammography screening programs. Dr. Peter Juni, a member of the Swiss Medical Board until recently, said one concern was that mammography was not reducing the overall death rate from the disease, but increasing overdiagnosis and leading to false positives and needless biopsies. ""The mammography story is just not such an easy story,"" said Dr. Juni, a clinical epidemiologist at the University of Bern. Even experts like Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, a professor of medicine at Dartmouth, who have questioned mammography's benefits were surprised by Switzerland's steps to reconsider its widespread use.","A 25-year study involving 90,000 women has found that the breast-cancer screenings did not lower the death rate from the disease and had harms.",7faf0300-90df-537e-bf08-b152d9590072,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/12/world/MAMMOGRAM/MAMMOGRAM-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=421&w=600&s=c9c9ac2718a6f625aeba740af59d4d18579b5d530809a81b4bdb0630da414cef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Nearly 75 percent of American women 40 and over say they had a mammogram in the past year.,7faf0300-90df-537e-bf08-b152d9590072,N24News/imgs/7faf0300-90df-537e-bf08-b152d9590072.jpg,1

HOAX

Donald Trump, Fox News and the Dangerous Distortion of Truth

By Brian Stelter Just about everyone understands that Fox News is the cheerleader in chief for a TV-obsessed president. We know the channel traffics in misinformation. We've seen hosts lob softball questions during their regular interviews with President Trump. Was anyone really surprised to see Sean Hannity warming up the crowd at a Trump rally? Even so, it is easy to forget the full extent of the power that Fox News wields over the Trump administration. The channel has spawned some of the defining myths of this presidency and spurred Trump to adopt positions so hard-line as to be unpalatable even to congressional Republicans. A small sampling of Fox's fictions: The ""caravan"" of terrorists and criminals supposedly marching north to invade America. The debunked conspiracy theory that a Democratic National Committee staffer was murdered for leaking campaign emails. The false claim that Ukraine, not Russia, was interfering in the 2016 election. Most recently, the deadly notion that the coronavirus was no worse than the seasonal flu. One moment those falsehoods were being served up by Fox personalities. The next, the president was parroting them, embellishing them, amplifying them to his tens of millions of social media followers -- sometimes even plagiarizing Fox's parodical chyrons.

This is the value of ""Hoax,"" the new book by the CNN journalist Brian Stelter. It provides a thorough and damning exploration of the incestuous relationship between Trump and his favorite channel -- and of Fox's democracy-decaying role as a White House propaganda organ masquerading as conservative journalism.

""Hoax"" is not likely to change many readers' minds. Its basic thesis -- that Fox is powerful and toxic -- is already conventional wisdom, thanks in part to last year's authoritative New York Times expose of Rupert Murdoch, whose company owns Fox. (Also, let's be honest, not many Fox fans are likely to read this book.) Even so, Stelter's cataloging of the power and toxicity of Fox is an important addition to the growing library of books documenting this strange period in American history. Fox's clout extends far beyond warping people's understanding of the world. Stelter shows, for example, how spurious attacks by Fox hosts led Trump to fire cabinet secretaries and shut down the federal government. It is the type of old-school media muscle-flexing that would be impossible under a stronger president. Stelter is at his best when he is explaining the underlying forces that led Fox to embrace propaganda. (Once upon a time, he writes, Fox had a journalistic culture.) Part of the reason is money. Fox News makes nearly $2 billion a year. Its intensely loyal audience allows the channel to charge more for advertising and in fees assessed by cable companies. Inciting viewers is crucial for keeping ratings high.

But there is another force at play. Many Fox employees view their job as catering to the president. Nothing gets people buzzing like a @realDonaldTrump tweet. ""Everyone at Fox could see that the way to get attention, to get promoted, to get ahead was to hitch a ride with Trump and never look back,"" Stelter writes. Some Fox journalists -- yes, they still exist! -- find this troubling. Very few have the guts to say so publicly.

Stelter traces the Trump-Fox synergies to 2011, when Roger Ailes, the channel's longtime boss, gave Trump a weekly phone-in slot on the ""Fox & Friends"" morning show. The platform provided him a direct line into the brains of millions of Republican primary voters. For its part, Fox got someone whose penchant for bombast and demagogy proved a ratings winner. That symbiosis inspired other Fox hosts, none more so than Hannity. Pre-Trump, Hannity was in trouble. He was churning out bland, predictable screeds against President Obama. Some producers were considering pairing him with a female co-host to spice things up. In Trump, Hannity sensed a chance to turn things around. He glommed onto the ascendant candidate, stoking fears of rigged elections, violent immigrants and murderous Democrats, and pitching Trump as the panacea. By the time Trump was sworn in, Hannity's entwinement with the new president went far beyond sycophantic interviews and concocted conspiracies. On a near-daily basis, Hannity served as a presidential sounding board, and Stelter amusingly describes the TV star as exhausted by the round-the-clock counseling. Stelter is far from an impartial observer. He is the host of a CNN show about the media, and his regular criticisms of Fox have made him a popular punching bag for Hannity and others. Early on in ""Hoax,"" Stelter acknowledges that he is ""shocked and angry"" by what is going on at Fox, and his emotions sometimes seem to get the better of him. He resorts to name-calling and spreads gratuitous gossip about Fox personalities, at one point quoting an unnamed source's assertion that a female anchor ""knew how to use sex to get ahead."" Coming from a victim of Fox's smears, it feels a little retributive. Stelter also glosses over the fact that CNN is guilty of its own, Fox-lite version of partisan pandering. Certain hosts tend to ask leading, left-leaning questions. Everyone is incentivized to say things that go viral; hyperbole trumps nuance. This is not new. Tucker Carlson -- who has emerged as Fox's leading promoter of racist lies -- rose to notoriety as a flamethrower on the CNN show ""Crossfire.""

To be clear, there is no equivalence between the occasionally inaccurate and misleading ""liberal media,"" which generally owns up to its mistakes, and the highly productive factory of falsehoods at Fox. But in a polarized America, cable news networks reflect and to varying degrees contribute to that polarization. My biggest disappointment with ""Hoax"" is that Stelter doesn't unpack the greatest mystery of Fox's success: Why is the channel's unbridled demagogy so enticing? Do viewers realize they're getting played? Do they care? The book cites research that shows Fox viewers are especially likely to hold inaccurate views of important issues, but what is actually going on in their heads when they sit down in front of the TV? The closest Stelter comes to answering this question is when he asserts that for some, ""Fox is an identity. Almost a way of life."" That may be true, but I would be curious to hear from and better understand those viewers. There is no sign that Stelter spoke to any. Readers are left to look down on Fox's millions of loyalists as gullible members of an extremist cult. It is just the sort of easy-to-digest but unnuanced conclusion that would play well on cable news.","In his new book, ""Hoax,"" Brian Stelter examines Fox's role as a White House propaganda organ masquerading as conservative journalism.",a7f34a15-e1ff-5807-aaa4-caeab5d190b0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/23/books/23enrich/23enrich-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=4883cc30ea01ffa315cc47a497e830caa898527541e540acb13d7ae61ed6ff86&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sean Hannity, left, interviewed President Donald Trump before a campaign rally at the Las Vegas Convention Center in 2018.",a7f34a15-e1ff-5807-aaa4-caeab5d190b0,N24News/imgs/a7f34a15-e1ff-5807-aaa4-caeab5d190b0.jpg,13
Health,"Inhaled Ebola Vaccine Stops Virus in Monkeys, Study Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/14/health/inhaled-ebola-vaccine-stops-virus-in-monkeys-study-finds.html,"A single dose of a new Ebola vaccine that can be inhaled has been found to neutralize the deadly virus in monkeys, researchers reported on Monday. The study, published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, demonstrated that the aerosol Ebola vaccine activated immune cells in the respiratory system of rhesus macaques and provided full protection against the virus. The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston and the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. It was the first attempt to use an aerosol to vaccinate monkeys against a hemorrhagic viral fever, the study's authors said. ""The initial several decades of attempts to develop a vaccine against the Ebola virus were unsuccessful,"" said Alexander Bukreyev, a virologist from the University of Texas Medical Branch and one of the paper's authors. ""This is one of the few vaccines that works.""

""This is a positive step forward,"" said Dr. Daniel Bausch, a virologist from Tulane University. ""It's not a breakthrough or 'Eureka!' "" The new vaccine can be administered without help from a medical professional. So if it proves successful in humans, the vaccine will be particularly useful in developing countries where there is a severe scarcity of doctors and nurses, as there is in West Africa, where the worst Ebola epidemic in history has yet to be extinguished. ""The discussion in the field right now is if this Ebola outbreak will be some kind of game changer for vaccine development, or will it only be one more scare that will be forgotten,"" said Dr. Igor Lukashevich, a medical virologist from the University of Louisville, who was not involved with the study. ""This aerosolized form of the vaccine is really what the field needs right now."" The study's lead author, Michelle Meyer, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas Medical Branch, said the respiratory tract may serve as a portal for the Ebola virus if it is exposed to droplets of infected bodily fluids.

In the study, the aerosol vaccine generated substantially more Ebola-immunity cells in the lungs than in the blood and spleen. The cells ""in the lungs are acting as the first barrier for protection,"" Dr. Meyer said. ""That's ideal to combat the virus at the site of infection."" Four of the rhesus macaques used in the research were given one dose of the aerosol vaccine; four were given two doses; and two were given the vaccine in a liquid form. Two monkeys were not vaccinated, serving as controls. Four weeks after their treatments, all 12 monkeys were injected with 1,000 times the fatal dose of the Ebola virus. A little over a week later, the two unvaccinated monkeys succumbed to the disease and were euthanized, but the vaccinated monkeys stayed healthy. At the end of the study, the researchers euthanized the surviving monkeys, examined their blood and tissues, and found no traces of the Ebola virus. ""One aerosol dose of our vaccine was able to protect these animals from death and severe disease,"" Dr. Meyer said. The next step will be for the team's colleagues at the National Institutes of Health to perform clinical trials of the vaccine on humans.","A study released on Monday offered hope for immunizing a wide array of people, including those who live in places with limited professional medical care.",219c725d-3da4-57d3-b99c-0c02ff42e1ad,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/14/science/14vaccine1/14vaccine1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=b8e649d38cd435279df76f9b3f59b8b506a660934e3a95dd243dcfb8dd11c201&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Michelle Meyer, left, and Alexander Bukreyev conducted research on an inhaled Ebola vaccine.

Your Money,Economic Gravity in the Oil Industry: What Goes Up Comes Down,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/30/your-money/economic-gravity-in-the-oil-industry-what-goes-up-comes-down.html,"Economic Gravity in the Oil Industry: What Goes Up Comes Down

IT'S not rocket science. What shoots up quickly usually comes back to earth. But a lot of people who hold leases to drill for oil on their land forgot that. Clarke and Sally Keeshan, whose income from leases on their Texas ranches fell by 60 percent in the last two years, are an exception. So is John Baen, a college professor who moonlights as a negotiator of drilling leases. When oil prices were at their peak, he said, the 150 wells that were on his land or land where he had negotiated the prices were bringing in about $100,000 a month. Now, he said, the amount has fallen by 80 to 90 percent. But both the Keeshans and Mr. Baen said they had learned lessons from previous oil and gas cycles. They treated the money they were receiving from leases on wells on their land almost like found money. ""After 33 years in the oil and gas industry, I'm somewhat familiar with the up and down cycles,"" Mr. Keeshan said. ""We've always had other means of income. Those leases have been secondary. We always planned for the day when this was coming.""

But the low price of oil -- around $45 a barrel, up from the $30 range a few months ago but far from its $100-plus price two years ago -- and what it has done financially to people associated with the oil and gas industry serves as a reminder to the rest of us: Some planning and a bit of pessimism can go a long way in any career with inherent uncertainty, which is most of them. Before the advent of fracking, the drilling rights on many pieces of land -- including the Permian Basin in West Texas, Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and the Bakken Shale in North Dakota -- were worthless. But the same technology that led to booms in these areas, and large lease payments for the people who owned the mineral rights on the land, contributed to the glut of oil worldwide and today's low prices. That, in turn, means less drilling. ""Oil is too easy to get out of the ground and too easy to find,"" said Paul Midkiff, national director of the oil, gas and mineral management group at Wells Fargo Private Bank. ""I truly believe it won't go back up to $100 a barrel."" Mr. Midkiff said there was too much oversupply, which would be used up only ""if the global economy kicks it into high gear.""

Yet a great reduction in cash flow for leaseholders has given them an opportunity for estate planning, even if the opportunity is not as great as in past busts. Mr. Keeshan said his family had set up a family partnership to own its land and mineral holdings. These partnerships allow the people setting them up to get discounts on the assets they are putting in, in the belief that family members would struggle to sell shares in the partnership at full value to outsiders. Yet, he said, he recently had some of the family's 10,000 acres of ranch land valued and it did not reflect the drop in oil prices. ""The value is up on the land even though we're not removing any oil,"" he said. ""At some point, the commodity will come back to the point where it will be economical to remove it again."" And that has been a challenge for estate planners. The existence of fracking has reduced the ability of appraisers to justify a greatly discounted price for the land and the mineral rights. ""The drilling success for wildcat drilling was one in 10 wells,"" Mr. Midkiff said. ""When you're talking about shale drilling, you're not going to find dry holes any more. You're going to find it and frack it out and have success nine out of 10 times. That's changed how we value these things."" The lower cash flow, though, has scared off some people from estate planning, for fear that if they put the leases into irrevocable trusts, which require them to give up the cash flow, they will not have enough money to live on. That could be shortsighted.

Allison Elliott, senior wealth planning strategist for Wells Fargo Private Bank, said she worked with a couple in their 50s who were set to do extensive estate planning at the peak of the oil boom. But as oil prices fell, and their lease income with it, they went from wanting to use both estate tax exemptions, which were worth over $10 million, to using one, to not returning her calls. ""By the end of 2015, their net worth was about a third,"" she said. ""Their cash flow was also cut back by two-thirds. But they're still well above the estate tax limits."" Now, she said, they are looking to put $3.5 million worth of leases into trust for their heirs. They got to that point by realizing that even if prices stayed low, they would have enough to live on. ""As the money kept rolling in, they started buying things, but they had a safety net first,"" she said. ""That was where we showed them that their safety net was going to work even if they didn't get more cash flow."" Dane E. Crunk, managing director of Syntal Capital Partners, said that the people in the production and oil service industries best poised to make it through this downturn were the ones with the lowest debt. And low debt is usually sensible advice for anyone. But that was more difficult to do in this boom, where production companies asked servicing firms to quickly add employees and equipment, he said. ""Even some of our more savvy service business owners were forced to take on more debt and grow more quickly than they would have done,"" he said. ""It's a really sore subject right now, this idea of partnership."" For oil and gas executives, the drop has been a mixed bag. Jonathan A. Blumenthal, managing director at United Capital in Dallas, said he had clients who retired after working 35 years at companies like Exxon Mobil and their retirement packages were good. He said that because interest rates were so low, the sizes of lump sum pension payouts were as high as they had ever been.

But executives at other oil companies like Chevron and BP, which have not been doing as well and are laying off people before they have fully funded their pensions, may find themselves struggling. ""Those defined-benefit plans look like a hockey stick,"" he said. ""You miss those last five years and it's impactful."" For people who thought, seemingly rationally, that they could retire early and the lease income would replace their salaries, the shock has been mighty. In some cases, given their careers in the oil industry, these retirees had other money invested in oil producers and pipeline companies that have lost value. Mr. Blumenthal said the clients who managed the decline in oil prices best were the ones who could imagine other sectors, like rental real estate, where the cash flow dried up when those properties were no longer rented. ""You have to show them what it looks like if they don't have that income,"" he said. ""Our process is to show you how the decisions in your life impact the process. You have to make decisions based on the things you can control."" Yet the best attitude with fluctuating wealth in a cyclical business is to look at it as money to be saved first and spent slowly.

Science,"China's Ban on Wildlife Trade a Big Step, but Has Loopholes, Conservationists Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/science/coronavirus-pangolin-wildlife-ban-china.html,"China this week announced a permanent ban on wildlife trade and consumption that international conservationists greeted as a major step, but one with troublesome loopholes for trade in wild animals for medicinal uses.

A wild animal market in Wuhan may have been where the outbreak of Covid-19 began, and pangolins, in particular, have been proposed as a possible host of the virus before it jumped to people.

China had already banned the wildlife markets. The action on Monday by a standing committee of the 13th National People's Congress went further. The decision on ""Comprehensively Prohibiting the Illegal Trade of Wild Animals, Eliminating the Bad Habits of Wild Animal Consumption, and Protecting the Health and Safety of the People,"" bans all trade and eating of non-aquatic wild animals.

But, according to an analysis by the Wildlife Conservation Society, the decision does not ban trade for fur, medicine or research. ""This creates a potential loophole for traffickers who may exploit the nonfood exemptions to sell or trade live wildlife,"" the group said in a statement.","The coronavirus epidemic prompted China to permanently ban trade of wild animals as food, but not for medicinal use.",db88eea7-0634-5fd4-8cd4-f2ccbd47147b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/27/science/27VIRUS-WILDLIFE/27VIRUS-WILDLIFE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=8bf0c6a8165e1dbb055d688530ff7d4f773699f6048da7e45f591a7610c17989&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Pangolins in particular have been proposed as a possible host of the virus before it jumped to people.,db88eea7-0634-5fd4-8cd4-f2ccbd47147b,N24News/imgs/db88eea7-0634-5fd4-8cd4-f2ccbd47147b.jpg,2
Economy,How Trump's Attacks on the Fed Have Made Its Job Harder,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/business/economy/fed-powell-trump-mnuchin-response-coronavirus.html,"President Trump has threatened to demote Jerome H. Powell, right, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, even as the coronavirus crisis coursed through financial markets.





WASHINGTON -- President Trump has spent two years publicly attacking the Federal Reserve and undercutting its chair, Jerome H. Powell. That animosity is making it difficult for Washington to project a united front as it stares down the most significant economic threat since the Great Recession. The Fed has moved at breakneck speed to try to alleviate economic harm from the coronavirus pandemic, which is closing businesses, knocking workers off payrolls and almost surely plunging the economy into a downturn. Within weeks, the central bank has slashed rates to near-zero and enacted many of the programs developed during the 2008 financial crisis. That pervasive sense of insecurity comes in part as Americans struggle to decipher what kind of coordinated economic response Washington is staging. During the 2008 financial meltdown, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chair at the time, seemed to be moving in lock step with the Treasury Secretary and the White House. But that sort of comity has not been emanating from Washington during the current crisis. Instead, Mr. Trump increased his criticism, even threatening to demote Mr. Powell as the crisis coursed through financial markets.

""One way to read the markets is, the markets don't have confidence in governments to respond to this,"" said David Wessel, the director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ""President Trump's repeated attempts to attack Jay Powell can't help but have made that worse."" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Mr. Powell have a good relationship and talk daily. But the two have yet to appear together during the crisis, and Mr. Powell has not been at any of the White House events where Mr. Trump discussed the economic response to the virus. Mr. Powell has also been absent from the airwaves except for a call-in news conference on Sunday. That is strikingly different from 2008, when Mr. Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. coordinated closely with President George W. Bush to pass the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The trio were pictured together after key meetings, and a New York Times headline from early 2008 reads ""Bush and Bernanke back economic stimulus."" Later, Mr. Bernanke worked with President Barack Obama and his Treasury Secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, to deal with fallout from the crisis. ""Whatever differences they may have had in the past should be put behind them to deal with the war on corona,"" said Hal S. Scott, the director of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation. Mr. Scott said it was critical that Treasury and the Fed coordinate closely, adding that it was time for Mr. Powell to be more visible.

Many economic policymaking veterans from past administrations have privately criticized Mr. Mnuchin and other Trump advisers for mismanaging the crisis. Several of Mr. Trump's top aides publicly played down the threat that the virus posed to the economy, even as it began to spread rapidly in China, Italy and parts of the United States. Until recently, when the administration pivoted to proposing large doses of fiscal stimulus to fight a contraction in economic activity, many administration officials -- and, repeatedly, Mr. Trump -- placed the onus for action on Mr. Powell and the Fed. Mr. Trump suggested as recently as Saturday that he was still considering demoting Mr. Powell, and on March 10 he called the institution ""pathetic, slow moving."" Days later, he wrote on Twitter that ""The Federal Reserve must FINALLY lower the Fed Rate to something comparable to their competitor Central Banks."" After the Fed cut rates to near-zero on Sunday, Mr. Trump grudgingly congratulated the central bank.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""That brings us in line with what other countries are,"" he said. ""They actually have negative rates, but look, we got it down to potentially zero. That's a big step, and I'm very happy they did it, and you will not hear anything bad about me unless it's a month or two from now."" The current White House rarely communicates with Mr. Powell. Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, has a monthly lunch with the Fed chair, but he and Mr. Mnuchin have only tepidly defended Mr. Powell in the face of presidential criticism.

The crisis response has been further complicated by a lack of top staffers at Treasury, along with a dearth of expertise managing such crises. Currently, the department does not have officials overseeing two top divisions, domestic finance and sanctions. Treasury's acting assistant secretary for international finance, Geoffrey Okamoto, is departing to be the first deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund. And Brian McGuire, the assistant secretary for legislative affairs, is expected to leave this spring. A senior Treasury official noted that Mr. Mnuchin had been speaking with Mr. Powell by phone multiple times a day and into the evenings in recent weeks. His deputy, Justin Muzinich, has also been in regular communication with counterparts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Treasury has developed an internal task force to assess the economic fallout of the virus. Mr. Muzinich, who had been overseeing the terrorist and financial intelligence unit, has shifted much of his focus domestic finance. Treasury's markets room now has nine full-time staff members providing updates to the secretary and, according to the official, the department is open to bringing in additional reinforcements as needed. But the light staffing has made it hard for any one official to communicate to the American public that the nation's economic leaders stand ready to do what it takes to calm markets and safeguard prosperity. Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the administration was failing to bolster markets. ""Everywhere you would look for reassurance, for leadership, for policy action, for reliable information, all are absent,"" he said. Those perceptions have obscured what has been a fast-paced response from the central bank. The Fed is often a first responder when something goes wrong in the economy. It is able to change interest rates and buy bonds much faster than elected officials can pass legislation and mail out checks.

This time is no exception. The central bank has gone from making its first emergency rate cut on March 3 to slashing interest rates to near-zero. It has beefed up programs to keep money markets functioning and rolled out an emergency lending scheme to help businesses access short-term funding. Late Wednesday, the Fed said it would offer loans to money market mutual funds, the vehicles that millions of Americans use to save money that can be readily tapped. Those lending programs were done in coordination with Treasury, an indication that a partnership does exist, even if it is not readily apparent. On Thursday, the Fed said it would also extend currency swap lines to nine more countries -- on top of the five relationships it already has -- in an attempt to keep dollars flowing to banks around the world. Officials are ""completely willing to do what it takes, to do what is necessary"" to support the economy, said Mary C. Daly, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. ""We learned a lot during the financial crisis about what tools are at our disposal."" She added, ""But we did not stop learning."" The Fed is throwing a kitchen sink of policies at the financial system to keep it operating smoothly, because short-term economic pain could turn into long-term suffering if credit crunches prevent companies from getting the cash they need to continue operating. Markets are not yet soothed. Investors continue to sell everything to raise cash, roiling Treasury markets, making corporate debt more expensive and challenging state and local financing schemes. Some have questioned whether the Fed is falling behind. Officials point out that it takes some time to get programs in place, and it will take time for them to work. ""These facilities are hard work, to get all of the operational aspects correct,"" said Eric Rosengren, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and an overseer of the money market program.

The central bank is taking communication partly into its own hands. It held a media blitz on Wednesday and Thursday, with regional presidents on television and press calls to pound out with one key message: The Fed is moving quickly, and it stands ready to act and willing to get creative. ""We should keep an open mind as to what else we have to do,"" Mr. Rosengren said in an interview.","The Federal Reserve has moved quickly to combat economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, but President Trump's ongoing attacks may have weakened its message.",0fdda48e-3fc3-5d0a-86c1-3f34ebae71ff,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/20/business/19DC-FED1-print/merlin_160978086_5e4b6909-4991-4493-bcea-79c7a13281af-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=e386e6d923eea1e7f0066363a8f68240e210f1b76d4d2fd7067b3db1f1d59aac&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Federal Reserve building in Washington, D.C.",0fdda48e-3fc3-5d0a-86c1-3f34ebae71ff,N24News/imgs/0fdda48e-3fc3-5d0a-86c1-3f34ebae71ff.jpg,8
Opinion,"After the Pandemic, a Global Hunger Crisis",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/opinion/coronavirus-global-hunger.html,"ROME -- The coronavirus pandemic and its punitive economic effects are about to set off the next global hunger crisis. In the last four years, conflicts, climate change and economic instability raised the number of people suffering acute hunger -- when the absence of food endangers people's livelihoods and, in some cases, their lives -- from 80 million to 135 million people. The pandemic could drive 130 million more people into that state by December. More than a quarter of a billion people are likely to be acutely hungry in 2020.

Workers employed in the informal economy and in service and manufacturing sectors are particularly vulnerable. Many have already experienced job losses during extended lockdowns: A staggering 94 percent of the global work force live in countries where workplaces have been closed. According to the International Labor Organization, the pandemic will have caused a loss of working hours in April, May and June equivalent to that of 305 million full-time jobs.

What's more, economic contraction and job losses in major economies such as the United States, Russia and the Gulf countries deliver a serious financial blow to numerous countries that rely heavily on overseas remittances -- substantially threatening their food security. In Haiti, remittances mostly from the United States make up almost 37 percent of the gross domestic product. In Nepal, remittances form 27 percent of G.D.P., 67 percent of which comes from migrant workers in the Gulf countries. And in Tajikistan, where remittances are 28 percent of the G.D.P., 76 percent comes from migrant workers in Russia. As the economies of the host countries suffer, remittances to low- and middle-income countries could fall this year by 19.7 percent, according to the World Bank. It's not just remittances. The pandemic's effect on countries dependent on exports of crude oil, such as Venezuela, Angola and Nigeria, also exacerbates global hunger. Oil prices crashed in the third week of April when the markets realized the severity of the pandemic's economic consequences. The virus has suspended most transportation and grounded the airline industry, a major consumer of crude oil. And the expected global recession will shrink the industrial sector, another big consumer of oil, further slashing demand. Crude oil accounts for about 84 percent of Venezuela's merchandise exports, 96 percent in Angola and 94 percent in Nigeria. Given their reliance on oil, the fall in prices translates into lack of funding for infrastructure, health care and wages. And a consequent increase in hunger.

And then there are the wars. As the pandemic disrupts food supply chains, the effects on people trapped in war zones, who almost completely rely on humanitarian assistance, are likely to be catastrophic. In Syria, 6.6 million people were living with acute hunger at the end of 2019. An additional 2.7 million people, according to our data, joined their ranks in the first three months of this year. That makes 9.3 million Syrians struggling with the higher cost of food, mass unemployment and a destroyed health care system. On Tuesday, the Syrian pound hit a record low of 3,000 against the dollar in the black market. Almost 32 percent of Syrians are eating insufficient quantities of food or skipping meals. Our projections indicate that the conflict, combined with the effects of the pandemic, will force another half a million people in Syria into acute hunger by the end of the year. In countries already besieged by climate crises and economic instability, the pandemic is making hunger much worse. In Zimbabwe, about 3.6 million people were already facing acute hunger in December. By March, the number rose to 8.9 million, according to our data, because of an extreme drought and the country's economic crisis. The lockdown imposed to battle the virus crippled the informal sector in Zimbabwe, as elsewhere. The official unemployment rate has risen from 11 percent in December to a staggering 90 percent after the lockdown. By mid-May, nearly 5.6 million Zimbabweans were coping by reducing portion size or skipping meals. And at least 800,000 more will become food insecure by the end of the year because of the loss of purchasing power from unemployment and reduced remittances.

Throughout history, when people have faced wars, natural disasters and unbearable hunger, they have migrated in the hope of finding safety, food and opportunity. That's true today. There is a high probability that we will soon see a wave of refugees, compelled by the economic effects of the coronavirus, leaving their countries and trying to reach the United States and Europe. Syrian refugees in Europe and Central American refugees on the United States border are stark reminders that people will make arduous journeys in hopes of a better life when they are left with nothing at home. Analysis from the World Food Program shows that refugee outflows increase by 1.9 percent for each percentage increase in acute hunger. As acute hunger is set to rise by nearly 50 percent, the scale of global movement can barely be imagined. Famines are not about food availability; they are about physical and economic access to food. The pandemic has worsened both, placing commercial transport under severe pressure and reducing purchasing power. Governments need to ensure that the production and supply of food is not disrupted. If farmers can't plant or harvest, if seeds and fertilizer are not available, if agricultural produce cannot reach markets, it will create dangerous food shortages. We can stop the coming global hunger crisis from getting worse through global collective action to save lives and protect livelihoods. Political solutions to conflicts, climate adaptation on the ground and reducing income inequality will go a long way to building resilient communities and nations.

Economy,"Working, but Needing Public Assistance Anyway",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/13/business/economy/working-but-needing-public-assistance-anyway.html,"A home health care worker in Durham, N.C.; a McDonald's cashier in Chicago; a bank teller in New York; an adjunct professor in Maywood, Ill. They are all evidence of an improving economy, because they are working and not among the steadily declining ranks of the unemployed. Yet these same people also are on public assistance -- relying on food stamps, Medicaid or other stretches of the safety net to help cover basic expenses when their paychecks come up short. And they are not alone. Nearly three-quarters of the people helped by programs geared to the poor are members of a family headed by a worker, according to a new study by the Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education at the University of California. As a result, taxpayers are providing not only support to the poor but also, in effect, a huge subsidy for employers of low-wage workers, from giants like McDonald's and Walmart to mom-and-pop businesses. ""This is a hidden cost of low-wage work,"" said Ken Jacobs, chairman of the Berkeley center and a co-author of the report, which is scheduled for release on Monday.

Taxpayers pick up the difference, he said, between what employers pay and what is required to cover what most Americans consider essential living costs. The report estimates that state and federal governments spend more than $150 billion a year on four key antipoverty programs used by working families: Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps and the earned-income tax credit, which is specifically aimed at working families.

This disparity has helped propel the movement to raise the minimum wage and prompted efforts in a handful of states to recover public funds from employers of low-wage workers. In Connecticut, for example, a legislative proposal calls for large employers to pay a fee to the state for each worker who earns less than $15 an hour. In 2016, California will start publishing the names of employers that have more than 100 employees receiving Medicaid, and how much these companies cost the state in public assistance. ""The low-wage business model practiced by many of the largest and most profitable employers in the country not only leaves many working families unable to afford the basics, but also imposes significant costs on the public as a whole,"" Sarah Leberstein, a senior staff lawyer with the National Employment Law Project, testified recently before Connecticut lawmakers.

Other states, as well as several cities, including Washington, D.C., have moved to raise the minimum wage above $10, while local activists in fast food, retailing, home care, airport services and other low-wage industries have organized protests to demand $15 an hour. Organizers of the Fight for 15 movement are planning a nationwide wave of protests and strikes for this Wednesday -- April 15. Adriana Alvarez, a cashier at a McDonald's in Chicago, is among the people pushing for higher wages. After five years with the fast-food giant, Ms. Alvarez, 22, earns $10.50 an hour, well above the federal minimum wage of $7.25. Still, she depends on food stamps, Medicaid and a child-care subsidy to help get through the week. ""He eats a lot,"" Ms. Alvarez said of her 3-year-old son, Manny, with a laugh. He also drinks a lot of milk, she said -- ""a half-gallon every two days"" -- and because he is lactose intolerant, he requires a more expensive brand, using up most of her $80 allotment of food stamps. Most everyone else she works with -- including many 10-year-plus veterans of the franchise -- receives food stamps, said Ms. Alvarez, who started working at McDonald's full time when she was in high school.

A report issued last week by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland said that labor's share of overall income had fallen to record lows in recent years while profits have soared. A handful of powerhouse companies have cited a tightening labor market as the reason behind recent wage increases, including McDonald's, which recently announced a $1 bump over the local legal minimum for its corporate employees. (The announcement does not apply to the vast majority of McDonald's employees, who work in franchises.) Several economists, including the Nobel Prize winner Joseph E. Stiglitz, who has written extensively on inequality, credited political rather than competitive pressures for the decision by some larger fast-food and retail employers to raise wages. William E. Spriggs, chief economist at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said the McDonald's announcement was ""a response to worker campaigns to increase the minimum wage and what is going on in legislatures on the state and local levels.""

Denise Rush, a home health care worker in Durham, N.C., often works seven days a week, returning home near midnight after her two teenagers have already gone to bed. At $9.50 an hour, her biweekly paycheck totals just over $700, or the cost of her monthly rent. There is little left for other expenses. ""It's a crazy dilemma,"" she said. ""Do I pay the whole bill or do I gas up the car to go to work?"" Despite receiving coverage for her children's health care from Medicaid as well as about $300 a month in food stamps, Ms. Rush, 41, is still struggling. ""We're talking about basic needs,"" she said, including such staples of modern life as a cellphone to keep in touch with work and her children and a home Internet connection to allow her children to do their homework.

Her paycheck also fails to pay for the uniforms and fees for the lacrosse, basketball and soccer teams that Ms. Rush says she believes are essential to keep her son and daughter occupied and out of trouble while she is working. Fortunately, she said, the school has helped pick up that tab. About 48 percent of home health care workers are on public assistance, the Berkeley researchers found. So are 46 percent of child care workers and 52 percent of fast-food workers. Even some of the nation's best-educated workers have turned to taxpayers for support; a quarter of the families of part-time college faculty members are on public assistance, the Berkeley researchers found. ""I'm very proud of my doctorate, it was well-earned, but in terms of the work force, it's a penalty,"" said Wanda Brewer, who lives in Maywood, a Chicago suburb, and teaches at DeVry and Concordia colleges. She is paid $2,700 for each 15-week course she teaches. She and her 4-year-old daughter are both on Medicaid; they also receive $390 a month in food stamps and a child care subsidy. She has applied for other jobs at chains like Walmart, Home Depot and Menard's, but says she can't even get a call back because such employers consider her overqualified. ""When I apply for anything outside education, they laugh at me,"" Ms. Brewer said. ""The term professor immediately commands respect. The assumption is you're making a fair wage, a living wage, but that is not necessarily so.""",A University of California study finds that taxpayer money is effectively subsidizing employers who pay at or around the minimum wage.,8896c484-aee2-5197-b985-11529ba92847,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/13/business/Wage1/Wage1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=d74ead93d5ad98cff3d38eee4fcfceee42268bc8f2e067100bc28c823248c2fb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Denise Rush, a home health-care worker in Durham, N.C., often works seven days a week, but still relies on food stamps and Medicaid for her children.",8896c484-aee2-5197-b985-11529ba92847,N24News/imgs/8896c484-aee2-5197-b985-11529ba92847.jpg,8

Theater,Review: An Online Chat Turns Unnerving in 'The Thing With Feathers',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/theater/thing-with-feathers-review-scott-organ.html,"Part thriller, part coming-of-age story, ""The Thing With Feathers"" is about chickens coming home to roost. The play fatally falls apart at the end, but Mr. Organ keeps us entertained for a good long while before that, making us guess and guess again about what, exactly, is going on here.

At the start, Anna and her mother, Beth (DeAnna Lenhart), are thriving. On their own since Anna was little, they are unusually close. They seem to skirt the prickly confrontations that come with adolescence -- though Anna is, in the way of so many teenagers, a master of casually if affectionately withering condescension.

Beth, a real estate agent, has finally found a truly good man, a cop named Tim (Robert Manning Jr.) who is calm, dependable, strong -- and, she's certain, about to propose. Eric (Zachary Booth) has romantic intentions, too, but he is a far more damaged creature. When he shows up uninvited at their house, forcing a face-to-face meeting with Anna, what he wants and what kind of danger he poses are unclear. He has precisely calculated the detonating impact he intends to have.

About that title, though. ""The Thing With Feathers"" is also a Dickinson reference, and Mr. Organ is mistaken in clinging to it.

Theater,"Once Cryptic, 'The Treatment' Now Proves Trenchantly Funny",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/19/theater/london-theater-treatment-arturo-ui-salome.html,"LONDON -- What a difference decades and a fresh eye make. When I first encountered Martin Crimp's ""The Treatment"" at the Royal Court in 1993, the play seemed like a deliberately gnomic exercise in sidelong nihilism, and it was largely greeted as such when it appeared Off Broadway that same year. No longer. As directed by Lyndsey Turner in a mordantly funny revival at the Almeida Theater in London running through June 10, Mr. Crimp's study in storytelling -- story making, really -- courses with a prickly humor that proves crucial to the whole. Sure, the situation the seemingly hesitant Anne (Aisling Loftus) describes at the start sounds pretty grim: an episode of domestic abuse that two film-industry figures are eager to co-opt as the basis for a movie. (Mr. Crimp's title acquires multiple meanings as the play progresses.) But Ms. Turner's grip on the jagged landscape of a play nominally set in New York but inhabiting a netherworld of its own is so firm that you don't question how Vermeer can be dropped into the conversation as casually as is Shakespeare in the Park. That particular cultural touchstone provides comic grist for Anne's husband, Simon (Matthew Needham), who is as proudly philistine as he is threatening. There's more than a trace of Lewis Carroll crossed with Caryl Churchill in Mr. Crimp's cityscape, where, by play's end, the blind are literally leading the blind, nodding at one point at ""King Lear."" The Rodgers and Hart standard ""Where or When"" is heard in passing, the plaintive confusion of the line ""but who knows where or when"" well suited to the rabbit hole down which the characters have perhaps fallen. And whether predator, victim or hapless onlooker, they are accompanied at every turn by a spiky wit that may, among other things, make you reconsider how you order Japanese food.

A luxury (and large) cast includes two alternating groups of extras who draw from the Almeida's self-described ""community company"" and swell the ranks as needed. But the defining roles are shrewdly inhabited not just by Ms. Loftus and Mr. Needham, as the fractured couple whose private lives become a celluloid prospect, but also by Julian Ovenden and Indira Varma as the ""facilitators"" in their mercenary midst, and Ian Gelder as a onetime big-deal playwright who is seen in the closing moments on the road to nowhere. Which, in the world of ""The Treatment,"" could be anywhere, as well. Bertolt Brecht's ""Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui,"" at the Donmar Warehouse in a new version from the Tony and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Bruce Norris (""Clybourne Park""), looks and sounds in Simon Evans's lively if self-defeating production as if it were set in a Chicago speakeasy in the 1930s. Many in the audience are seated at ringside tables that recall the famous Sam Mendes production of ""Cabaret"" at the same venue, and several brave playgoers get roped into the action and even, ahem, bumped off (not really, of course) -- which probably isn't what they expected when they bought tickets for a springtime matinee.

But not content solely to have the actor-comedian Lenny Henry's capacious Ui parallel the rise of Hitler, as was Brecht's intent, the production, which runs through June 17, reaches in the direction of President Trump, complete with a ""Make This Country Great Again"" banner that drops obligingly into view. Alas, after a while, the anything-for-a-response aesthetic gives evidence of wear and tear, the prevailing impact less chilling than exhausting. The material feels like an assemblage of turns that are arguably more fun to perform than they are to watch, notwithstanding a game company that includes Giles Terera, Lucy Ellinson, and Justine Mitchell. At the climax, we're encouraged by Ui to vote either in support of or against his budding powers, but I and others near me chose to abstain. If politics is indeed theater, that presumably counts as a mixed review.

Passing references not to Mr. Trump but to ""this new wave of nationalism,"" and freighted use of the word ""refugee,"" would appear to tilt the new National Theater production of ""Salome"" toward the here and now, but think again. The atmosphere is admittedly striking, as one has come to expect from the work of the writer-director Yael Farber: shimmering veils of falling sand, billowing sheets, as well as lighting from Tim Lutkin that irradiates the vast reaches of the Olivier stage, where the play runs in repertory through July 15. (It will be broadcast via National Theater Live on June 22.) But once the cast starts moving, largely in slow motion, and intoning the language rather than speaking it, whatever idea Ms. Farber may have had about reclaiming a heroine who fed artists as diverse as Ken Russell, Richard Strauss and Oscar Wilde disappears in the black hole of pretension. I have rarely heard such tepid applause at a National opening night as I did when this tortuous evening (there is no break) crawled to a close. An earlier version of Ms. Farber's play was warmly received in Washington in late 2015, so one has to wonder what happened in the trans-Atlantic crossing. A playgoer's heart doesn't exactly leap at the division of the title character into two separate personages, who go by ""Salome so-called"" (played by Isabella Nefar) and, if you please, Nameless (Olwen Fouere). That second figure is, in fact, the portentously spoken, older Salome herself, who is seen here narrating a revisionist account of a time-honored slice of Judean history. The tale ""begins at the end,"" or so a ferret-like Ms. Fouere informs us, allowing Ms. Farber to grant a degree of revolutionary zeal and agency to the femme fatale who demanded the head of John the Baptist. So far, so right, you might think, were it not for the insistence on proclamation over conversation, and for language so overripe -- the saliva imagery is a doozy -- that the entire thing verges on the self-satiric. Ms. Farber has had success in London in the past, not least with a stunning version of Lorraine Hansberry's rarely seen ""Les Blancs"" on the Olivier stage last year. For now, chalk ""Salome"" up to a wrong-footed experiment in fictive reimagining. You can deconstruct material only so far before it evaporates not into namelessness, but into nothing.","A London revival makes a strong case for Martin Crimp's play, while versions of ""Arturo Ui"" and ""Salomé"" fall short.",ef3521b3-0af2-5593-9b1b-49dfb38dc7db,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/20/arts/20wolf-london2-inyt/20wolf-london2-inyt-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=44e175da8e1a1f7f3ede35f6f9907ea5533d3d8c3f529a6e8d4e38598768add2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Gloria Obianyo in ""The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui.""",ef3521b3-0af2-5593-9b1b-49dfb38dc7db,N24News/imgs/ef3521b3-0af2-5593-9b1b-49dfb38dc7db.jpg,10
Style,Business Casual? It's Robes and Slippers All Day Now,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/style/robes-pajamas-slippers-working-from-home.html,"When Dr. Denise McDermott, 49, isn't seeing patients for telehealth appointments, there's a good chance she's wearing a robe. In fact, as soon as she and her 11-year-old son finish the video portion of their work and school days, they both make the switch. ""It's become our joke during the pandemic: We're the robe family,"" said Dr. McDermott, a psychiatrist in Manhattan Beach, Calif. Now that many homes have become de facto offices for the foreseeable future, work wardrobes have adjusted accordingly. ""It's important to be mindful of what makes you feel good,"" said Dr. McDermott. ""Wearing a robe is almost like giving yourself permission to relax, but it also makes me feel powerful and confident."" The robe is just one of many cozy styles catching on in isolation; sweatsuits, pajamas and slippers have also seen an uptick in sales, and leggings have replaced structured pants for many people. But while form-fitting athleisure is intended (if not worn) for physical activity, pure leisure wear is an unabashed investment in time off.

""When I step into slippers and walk outside to check the mail, I feel like a hot, confident Upper East Side housewife,"" Ms. Lester, a painter in Brooklyn, added. In the 19th century, robes (or dressing gowns) were worn by men and women as a transitional garment. They also gave women the freedom to complete household tasks and activities unbound by restrictive corsets. Now celebrities such as Chrissy Teigen and Andy Cohen are embracing the robe for similar reasons and inspiring their followers to do the same. Retailers have reported a rise in sales from their leisure collections, which include robes and sleepwear. According to Jennifer Foyle, global brand president for Aerie, sales from the brand's ""Real Free Sleep Collection"" more than doubled between February and April 2020. Similarly, a rep for Lands' End said that sales of women's sleepwear are up more than 75 percent from last year.

Supportive slippers and house shoes are selling, too. For example, Vionic, which specializes in on-trend, podiatrist-approved footwear, has seen a 300 percent year-over-year increase in slipper sales, according to a representative for the brand. The shoe company Birdies's best-selling style used to be a classic black loafer; now it's a luxe satin slide. ""We've seen a significant shift in style preferences in recent weeks, with slide sales having increased by 200 percent since the beginning of April, once our customers knew they would be home for the foreseeable future,"" Bianca Gates, the co-founder and C.E.O. of Birdies, said. Instead of spending the summer in overly-air-conditioned offices, many will still be working from home, where staying cool will be a priority. Alexis Herb, 25, a geographic information system technician intern from Boston, recently ordered a silk robe to wear around the house because she wanted ""something that was light and comfortable -- especially when it's warmer out."" Similarly, Rachel Bolt, 24, a student nurse from Shasta County, Calif., is the proud owner of a new silk robe from Kim + Ono, which she wears with bedazzled slippers that feature Larry David's face to complete her ""quarantine uniform."" Ms. Bolt has endometriosis and said that the robe takes some pressure off her abdomen. ""It's incredibly comfortable,"" she said. ""I feel sexy, for lack of a better term, and in a weird way, I feel more put together.""

Helen Sharp, 34, who owns a P.R. agency in Austin, Texas, already had an extensive robe collection, but bought a Cleobella kimono when she realized she would be working from home. ""I feel elegant in a nice robe and wanted an extra colorful one to lift my spirits during these weird times,"" she said. ""I also feel like social norms have kind of hilariously flown out the window during the stay at home order, and wearing a robe just feels more natural and suitable to me than anything else.""

Men are embracing robe life, too. Matt Sarafa, 22, a designer specializing in gender-neutral fashion and a student at U.C.L.A., sees the robe as a garment that is not just flowing but gender-fluid. ""Men can be kind of weird about wearing things that don't fit the exact mold of masculinity, but I feel like robes are almost an exception to that because they kind of have a silhouette like a dress, but are still 'socially acceptable' in the very patriarchal society we live in,"" he said. His garment of choice these days is a black Versace robe with gold baroque sleeves. ""It's a little bougie,"" he said. ""Now that I'm home 24-7, I might as well be comfy and fly."" Michael James Nuells, 31, a professional actor and special events manager from Toluca Lake, Calif., made an investment in a silk smoking jacket (inspired by Hugh Hefner's) and a pair of blue velvet slippers to match. ""I can't lie,"" he said, ""being wrapped in my new jacket and strutting around my house in my new get-up makes me feel pretty fantastic, especially in these horribly uncertain times.""","Nonessential workers are embracing leisure wear, saying it makes them feel not just relaxed but powerful.",61e17b42-463b-5416-86a6-1567cebb0fef,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/21/fashion/25LOUNGEWEAR1/25LOUNGEWEAR1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=81d221a6fafe04176a448e0b6f8755e436043710331d8c68da995f3b29f73fbd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Michael James Nuells, a professional actor and special events manager in Toluca Lake, Calif., has become a lounge wear enthusiast since the pandemic sent him home for the foreseeable future.",61e17b42-463b-5416-86a6-1567cebb0fef,N24News/imgs/61e17b42-463b-5416-86a6-1567cebb0fef.jpg,15
Dance,French Olympic Ice Dancers Make Skating as Ethereal as Ballet,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/arts/dance/ice-dancing-gabriella-papadakis-guillaume-cizeron.html,"Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron, skating to Beethoven's ""Moonlight"" Sonata, expanded the idea of virtuosity with the way they completely tuned in to each other.

The Olympics ice dancing competition came down to a dress. On Monday night, the French team of Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron took the silver medal while Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir of Canada won the gold. The back story, which everyone probably knows by now, is that near the start of the French pair's short dance on Sunday, the top of Ms. Papadakis's halter dress became unfastened. As she explained afterward, there was nothing left for her to do but pray. But as their skate continued, her breast was briefly exposed. This wardrobe glitch cost the pair points and put them behind the Canadians going into the free dance. Skating, especially on the Olympic level, is a sport with a mystifying judging system. But as a dance critic, I judge skating by different rules, and to me, no team, gold medal or not, matches the artistry of Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron. When a free dance program shows two bodies moving as one, as Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron's did, it is just as ethereal as ballet. Suddenly, a competition is a conduit for more than skating. It's a window into another space and time: eerie, quiet, floating.

The women's singles event wraps up on Thursday night, but for me the real hero of the Olympic Games has been ice dancing. It has artistic breadth, and this year the talent ran deep. While the tricks in singles and pairs skating have become relentless -- you hold your breath in fear that a skater will fall -- ice dancing gets at the essence of skating. Yes, it's skating and yes, it's dance, but it's the combination of the two that captures the freedom of what skating can be.

While examples of gorgeous skaters abound in singles and pairs skating, ice dancing is a different beast. Self-expression is as worthy as a successfully executed twizzle sequence -- a series of multirotational turns on one foot. But the art of self-expression can be questionable, too. I still can't wrap my head around the decision by Maia and Alex Shibutani, who won the bronze medal, to skate to Coldplay's sensual ""Paradise."" This American brother and sister, revered for their precision and joie de vivre, are elite athletes. But when they pressed together in head-to-toe camel spins -- each holding onto the other's extended free leg and waist to the lyric ""Para-para-paradise"" -- it gave me pause. I couldn't have skated to that with one of my brothers. (And I know that reading this, they are relieved.) Ms. Virtue and Mr. Moir, this season's sentimental favorites -- they won silver four years ago and reunited for what was likely their last stab at the gold -- burn with a seething rapture that has become performative, distractingly so. I'll never tire of their skill -- their consummate speed and control -- but this year, as they swept across the ice with gaping mouths to music from the ""Moulin Rouge"" soundtrack, they ran my red light.

It's true that skating isn't pure dance. It is, though, extraordinary in its own right and can possess the quiet sophistication, musicality and nuance of dance. With Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron, skating has room to grow. They aren't merely ice dancers: They dance on the ice, showing how it's capable of becoming a living canvas, one that curves toward the skater as the skater curves back into it. In ice dance, there are no lifts above the head, no heroic jumps. Its power is rooted in a blade's deep etchings, the angle of plush knee bends and, despite those awkward boots, toes that point and extend the length of a leg to create fluent line. Arms lengthen from the back with fingers that grow along with them. If, in pairs and singles skating, it seems like the air is increasingly being sucked out of routines to make room for more jumps -- it's worse when they're crammed into the second half in order to score more points -- ice dance pushes skating to a more poetic place. How can skaters bring emotion to a blade? How does their musicality play into a seemingly simple essence of motion? A skater moves forward and backward on the inside or outside edge of a blade. In ice dance, this is not rushed but emphasized in strokes that lean and bend to propel a skater from one side of the rink to the other. In the singles and pairs world, pristine edges can be forsaken for jumps and lifts, but one skater who pays attention to the details in between is the American Adam Rippon. He has become a media sensation for his outspokenness, but what I love most about him is his skating. He moves like silk. He cares about line; his spins have an endearing lightness, as the arch of his back in his layback -- arguably the most beautiful spin in skating -- attests.

He skates for himself, the same way Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron skate -- as if they are in their own world. When I watch them, my mind goes to a Jerome Robbins quote about ""Dances at a Gathering,"" his sublime 1969 ensemble ballet. ""You should never dance anything for the audience,"" he said. ""It ruins it if you do. You should dance only to each other. As if the audience weren't there. It's very hard.""

In figure skating, it's a radical idea. But in their free skate program, set to Beethoven's ""Moonlight"" Sonata, Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron expanded the idea of virtuosity with the way they completely tuned in to each other. Often in ice dancing, you keep your eye on the woman; the man, as in the case of Mr. Moir, is there, in part, to show off the woman -- to spark her fire. But the lyrical and musical Ms. Papadakis and Mr. Cizeron are more of a slow boil. Moving as one, they are gossamer as they transform the ice into air. Their free dance unfurled gradually and hypnotically, building to feverish spin sequences. One, in which Mr. Cizeron rotated in a sit spin while holding Ms. Papadakis's extended leg as she opened her right shoulder and head to the ceiling, was a spectacle of position and daring. As soon as the piano became subdued and dreamy, their flurry of footwork returned to the quiet hush of the start. As they glided across the ice in whispering strokes, it seemed as if they were no longer skating in an arena, but on a pond. In that moment, at once bracing and luminous, the Olympics turned from being a competition into a performance. This year the silver was the gold.","A dance critic's take: They didn't win the gold, but no team matched the artistry of Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron.",f3944fdc-f3bf-55a3-ad1b-4ad50b6348c8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/22/arts/22ICESKATING-CUL1/22ICESKATING-CUL1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=4d32f56169793ee0790d3240c729943956525ac7d9ea8abf5d891bafd2caf50c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron, skating to Beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;Moonlight&rdquo; Sonata, expanded the idea of virtuosity with the way they completely tuned in to each other.",f3944fdc-f3bf-55a3-ad1b-4ad50b6348c8,N24News/imgs/f3944fdc-f3bf-55a3-ad1b-4ad50b6348c8.jpg,6
Science,"Congratulations, You Survived Black Hole Week",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/science/black-hole-week.html,"With everything else that has been going on lately down here on this planet, you might not have noticed that there has been a lot of news lately about black holes, those Einsteinian monsters that can swallow light and everything else, behaving badly. Black holes eating stars, or whole gangs of them. Black holes burping energy from the centers of galaxies. Black holes banging together in universe-shaking events. It sounds like cosmology according to Stephen King. Over the summer I was on a lake in Peru, where the water was boiling with feeding piranha, their little black fins furiously breaking the surface. I was safe in the boat. Then. Turns out that it has been Black Hole Week, complete with its own hashtag, according to NASA. ""I think they wanted to highlight all of the black-hole work that NASA telescopes have done and are doing, and combine it into a weeklong social-media event,"" Peter Edmonds, a spokesman for the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and the Chandra X-ray Observatory, wrote in an email. Indeed, telescopes on the ground and in space, scanning the sky in everything from X-rays to radio waves, have combined to tell some scary stories. Here are a few to get you in the mood.

With their sights set relatively close to home, astronomers from the University of California, Los Angeles, reported this month that the giant black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy had become inexplicably hungrier. The black hole, the abyssal grave of about 4.3 million suns worth of mass, usually emits a dull radio glow as gas and dust swirl in and heat up. This summer, however, it got so hot and bright that the astronomers mistook it for a real star. Andrea Ghez, a U.C.L.A. astrophysicist who has long monitored the object, which is known as Sagittarius A*, had never seen it so bright. ""It's usually a pretty quiet, wimpy black hole on a diet,"" she said in a news release. ""We don't know what is driving this big feast."" Maybe it swallowed an asteroid, or shredded and finally swallowed gas from a double star called G2 that passed close to the black hole in 2014.

Peering farther out, other astronomers spotted a black hole destroying and shredding a star in distant galaxy. It happened in January, in full view of a pair of NASA's space-based eyes -- a robotic telescope in South Africa that is part of a network called the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, or ASASSN (which is pronounced ""assassin""). Tom Holoien, of the Carnegie Observatories was surveying the sky as part of his work for the network from a telescope in Chile . He saw the sudden flash in a galaxy that lies 375 million light-years away behind the constellation Volans in the far southern sky. Dr. Holoien alerted the operators of NASA's Swift satellite, which monitors X-rays from violent high-energy events, and NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, which happened to be staring at that part of the sky looking for the blinks in starlight caused when exoplanets pass in front of them. As a result, TESS recorded the entire event in the background of its planet search.

Gradually the astronomers realized that the flash wasn't behaving like a supernova but rather like a tidal disruption event. In such a calamity, a star that wanders too close to a black hole experiences intense tidal forces that pull it apart. The star is reduced to spaghetti-like streams of gas that circle the black hole. Some gas eventually falls in and disappears, but a lot of it is tossed free and crashes into other gases. ""It's a messy process, where a lot of gas is flying in different directions at high speeds,"" Dr. Holoien said. Astronomers have seen this happen about two dozen times in other distant galaxies, but so far not in our own, Dr. Holoien said. He described the January event as a ""poster child"" for black-hole shredding. The mass of the object is about 6.3 million times greater than that of our sun, making it slightly more massive than the black hole squatting at the center of the Milky Way.

""We don't know as much about the star,"" Dr. Holoien said, although he says that it was probably ""pretty similar to our sun."" If there are any astronomers to be found in a faraway trio of galaxies collectively called SDSS J084905.51+111447.2, they likely are anxiously anticipating a display of fireworks that will unfortunately end their own existence. The three galaxies are circling each other in the slow dance of merging, and each harbors a supermassive black hole at its center. These gigantic, wheeling behemoths of nothing are on course to collide in about 1 billion years. Such a collision would rattle the bones of the cosmos and could shake apart nearby matter. One of the black holes is 460 million to 2.9 billion times more massive than the sun, according to radio and X-ray measurements, said Ryan Pfeifle of George Mason University and the lead author of a recent paper about the galaxies. The galaxies and their dense black hearts currently lie about 30,000 light-years apart, at least as viewed from Earth, which is about 1 billion light-years from the action. But nobody really knows what will happen when they get closer to one another. ""Not all galaxies that appear to be 'merging' will actually end up 'fully' merged,"" Dr. Pfeifle said in an email. ""Sometimes you have flyby interactions that look like an ongoing merger, but the galaxies never actually merge.""

""I would say at this point it is anyone's guess as to which, if any, of the black holes will be sling-shotted out,"" Dr. Pfeifle wrote. ""Simulations in the literature predict that it should happen when you have three supermassive black holes interacting."" But without more data on the orbits and energies of these objects, he added, it was impossible to predict how, when or if the apocalypse would happen. A collision between two or three supermassive black holes could light up gravitational wave detectors on Earth. In September of 2015, those observatories gave Einstein his greatest moment in a century when they recorded space-time ripples emanating from the collision of a pair of black holes. The data agreed perfectly with his prediction that enough matter and energy in one place would sink together endlessly, wrapping space and time like a glove around it -- a black hole. LIGO and its ilk have made clear that the universe is full of these beasts rumbling and bumping around in the dark. After a brief rest, the twin LIGO antennas and their European relation, VIRGO, resumed sentry duty this spring. Their watch has paid off. Last spring I downloaded a smartphone app called Gravitational Waves Events, which sends an alert every time LIGO or VIRGO detects a presumed gravitational wave. The alert arrives as a short chirp, the characteristic signal produced by a pair of colliding black holes as they speed up in the last seconds of their marriage. It's gone off some four dozen times since April. Sometimes I hear it in my sleep. Of course, black holes don't roam the universe like vampires looking for victims. They are as lazy as they are fat. They eat what the winds and currents of space and the dance of gravity bring to them. But that can be a lot. The more that astronomers learn about the universe, the more it seems that what goes around comes around, whether in the form of meteoroids from Mars or interstellar comets from other stars. Oblivion is random. The issues raised by black holes, of what might be delicately called the Ultimate State -- whatever it is that happens when you hit the bottom of a black hole -- are always with us.",Here are three cosmic events you may have missed and that fortunately missed you.,e80fd68b-bd6e-56ee-a8a1-9d77e02c6fb4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/science/27BLACKHOLEWEEK1/27BLACKHOLEWEEK1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=1ea28ee4905c121a4968a250cbfaea9da6f6a1290f1a418d03f66625c909cdef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A simulation of a black hole's accretion disk, where matter collects into a thin, hot, turbulent churn of gas as it is drawn in by the object's gravity.",e80fd68b-bd6e-56ee-a8a1-9d77e02c6fb4,N24News/imgs/e80fd68b-bd6e-56ee-a8a1-9d77e02c6fb4.jpg,2

212-219-1222, newmuseum.org 'HUMA BHABHA: WE COME IN PEACE' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 28). This spare and unsettling sculptural installation for the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Roof Garden Commission includes two figures: one that is somewhat humanoid but with a ferocious mask-face and that visually dwarfs the jagged Manhattan skyline behind it, and another bowing in supplication or prayer, with long cartoonish human hands and a scraggly tail emerging from its shiny, black drapery. The title is a variant on the line an alien uttered to an anxious crowd in the 1951 science-fiction movie ""The Day the Earth Stood Still,"" but it ripples with other associations: colonization, invasion, imperialism or missionaries and other foreigners whose intentions were not always innocent. The installation also feels like an extension of the complex, cross-cultural conversation going on downstairs, inside a museum packed with 5,000 years of art history. (Schwendener)

212-535-7710, metmuseum.org 'CANOVA'S GEORGE WASHINGTON' at the Frick Collection (through Sept. 23). When Canova's statue arrived in Raleigh, N.C., in 1821, the American press went wild for the likeness of the first president, wearing Roman military dress and drafting his farewell address, by the Italian neoclassical sculptor. Ten years later it was destroyed by fire -- but the Frick has brought the full-scale plaster model of the lost statue over from Italy for this smashing show that reveals how European artists were inspired by American revolutionary ideals. Canova's Washington, looming all alone over the Frick's circular gallery, wears thickly curled hair instead of the pulled-back style he sports on the dollar bill, and in both his costume (leather skirt, strappy sandals) and his bearing, he embodies the ideals of the new republic, where principles come before power. Supplementary materials include a life mask of Washington and several smaller Canova models, including a nude Washington with some rather nice pecs. (Jason Farago)

212-288-0700, frick.org 'THE FACE OF DYNASTY: ROYAL CRESTS FROM WESTERN CAMEROON' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Sept. 3). In the African wing, a show of just four commanding wooden crowns constitutes a blockbuster in its own right. These massive wooden crests -- in the form of stylized human faces with vast vertical brows -- served as markers of royal power among the Bamileke peoples of the Cameroonian grasslands, and the Met's recent acquisition of an 18th-century specimen is joined here by three later examples, each featuring sharply protruding cheeks, broadly smiling mouths and brows incised with involute geometric patterns. Ritual objects like these were decisive for the development of Western modernist painting, and a Cameroonian crest was even shown at MoMA in the 1930s, as a ""sculpture"" divorced from ethnography. But these crests had legal and diplomatic significance as well as aesthetic appeal, and their anonymous African creators had a political understanding of art not so far from our own. (Farago)

'GIACOMETTI' at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (through Sept. 12). This museum-filling outing for the signal sculptor of Western modernism is rather cautious -- but revisionism can wait another day when the art looks as good as it does here. The Swiss artist's witty and erotic early sculpture, such as the still-shocking ""Disagreeable Object"" (a phallic torture device with a spiked business end), enraptured the Surrealists in early 1930s Paris, but Giacometti was never content with an art of ideas, and in his filthy studio, he soon started making elongated, emaciated humanoids that have since become emblems of Europe's postwar trauma. If you know Giacometti best for the bronzes that now go for obscene sums at auction, it's a particular pleasure here to see his work in plaster, a medium he adored; the humility of the handwork testifies to his anxious mastery. (Farago)

212-423-3800, guggenheim.org 'HEAVENLY BODIES: FASHION AND THE CATHOLIC IMAGINATION' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Cloisters (through Oct. 8). Let us pray. After last year's stark exhibition of Rei Kawakubo's irregular apparel, the Met Costume Institute is back in blockbuster mode with this three-part blowout on the influence of Catholicism on haute couture of the last century. The trinity of fashion begins downstairs at the Met with the exceptional loans of vestments from the Vatican; upstairs are gowns fit for angels in heaven (by Lanvin, Thierry Mugler, Rodarte) or angels fallen to earth (such as slinky Versace sheaths garlanded with crosses). The scenography at the Met is willfully operatic -- spotlights, choir music -- which militates against serious thinking about fashion and religion, but up at the Cloisters, by far the strongest third of the show, you can commune more peacefully with an immaculate Balenciaga wedding gown or a divine Valentino gown embroidered with Cranach's Adam and Eve. (Farago)

212-535-7710, metmuseum.org 'THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION' at the Museum of the Moving Image. The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America's great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program ""Sam and Friends"" before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother's old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through ""Sesame Street"" and ""The Muppet Show,"" though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and storyboards and rediscover some old friends. (Farago)

718-784-0077, movingimage.us 'HISTORY REFUSED TO DIE: HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE SOULS GROWN DEEP FOUNDATION GIFT' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Sept. 23). This inspired foundation is dispersing around 1,200 works by black self-taught artists from the American South to museums across the country. The Met's exhibition of 29 of the 57 pieces it received proposes an exciting broadening of postwar art. It is dominated by the dialogue between the rough-hewed relief paintings of Thornton Dial and the geometrically, chromatically brilliant quilts of the Gee's Bend collective. But much else chimes in, including works by Purvis Young, Joe Minter and Lonnie Holley. (Roberta Smith)

212-535-7710, metmuseum.org 'ALEJANDRO G. INARRITU: CARNE Y ARENA' at 1611 Benning Road NE, Washington (through Aug. 31, 9 a.m.-9 p.m.). Perhaps the most technically accomplished endeavor yet in virtual reality -- but closer in form to immersive live theater, created by a two-time Oscar winner -- has arrived at a former church in Washington after outings in Cannes, Milan, Los Angeles and Mexico City. In ""Carne y Arena"" (""Flesh and Sand""), you explore the exhibition on your own with a motion-sensitive headset that transports you to Mexico's border with the United States; brutal encounters with border guards interweave with surreal dream sequences, which you can perceive in three dimensions. The characters are computer renderings of the bodies of actual migrants; the landscapes are photographed by Mr. Inarritu's brilliant longtime cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki. It remains too early to say whether virtual reality will reshape art institutions, but this is a rare achievement, and not only for its political urgency. Tickets will be released only on the website at 8 a.m. Eastern Time on the 1st and 15th of each month of the exhibition's duration. (Farago)

'THE LONG RUN' at the Museum of Modern Art (through Nov. 4). The museum upends its cherished Modern narrative of ceaseless progress by mostly young (white) men. Instead we see works by artists 45 and older who have just kept on keeping on, regardless of attention or reward, sometimes saving the best for last. Art here is an older person's game, a pursuit of a deepening personal vision over innovation. Winding through 17 galleries, the installation is alternatively visually or thematically acute and altogether inspiring. (Smith)

212-708-9400, moma.org 'GEORGIA O'KEEFFE: VISIONS OF HAWAI'I' at the New York Botanical Garden (through Oct. 28). Finding out O'Keeffe had a Hawaiian period is kind of like finding out Brian Wilson had a desert period. But here it is: 17 eye-popping paradisal paintings, produced in a nine-week visit in 1939. The paintings, and their almost psychedelic palette, are as fleshlike and physical as O'Keeffe's New Mexican work is stripped and metaphysical. The other star of the show, fittingly, is Hawaii, and the garden has mounted a living display of the subjects depicted in the artwork. As much as they might look like the products of an artist's imagination, the plants and flowers in the Enid Haupt Conservatory are boastfully real. On Aloha Nights every other Saturday in July and August, the garden is staging a cultural complement of activities, including lei making, hula lessons and ukulele performances. (William L. Hamilton)

718-817-8700, nybg.org 'RENOIR: FATHER AND SON/PAINTING AND CINEMA' at Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia (through Sept. 3). Jean Renoir transformed the history of cinema with humanistic, precisely edited films like ""The Grand Illusion,"" and especially ""The Rules of the Game"" -- considered one of the greatest films ever made, though it was a box-office flop on its release in 1939. Yet the critic he strove most to please was his father, the Impressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir. This terrific dad-and-lad exhibition, organized with Paris's Musee d'Orsay, interweaves painting and cinema into a heartfelt survey of Jean Renoir's career, and finds paternal influence in the pastoral romance of ""A Day in the Country"" or the bright landscapes of his 1959 color film ""Picnic on the Grass."" The irony? It is Jean Renoir who now seems the more inventive artist, even if he was convinced that ""I have always imitated my father."" (Farago)

'SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION' at the Jewish Museum. After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike -- Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilettantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago)

212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org 'THE SENSES: DESIGN BEYOND VISION' at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum (through Oct. 28). There's a serious, timely big idea at this exhibition: As social media, smartphones and virtual reality make us ever more ""ocularcentric,"" we have taken leave of our nonvisual senses -- and need to get back in touch, literally. Thus ""The Senses"" features multisensory adventures such as a portable-speaker-size contraption that emits odors, with titles like ""Surfside"" and ""Einstein,"" in timed combinations; hand-painted scratch-and-sniff wallpaper (think Warhol's patterned cows but with cherries -- cherry-scented, naturally); and a device that projects ultrasonic waves to simulate the touch and feel of virtual objects. The show also presents commissions, videos, products and prototypes from more than 65 designers and teams, some of which address sensory disabilities like blindness and deafness, including Vibeat, which can be worn as a bracelet, brooch or necklace and translates music into vibrations. And if you bring the kids, they will likely bliss out stroking a wavy, fur-lined installation that makes music as you rub it. (Michael Kimmelman)

212-849-8400, cooperhewitt.org 'CHAIM SOUTINE: FLESH' at the Jewish Museum (through Sept. 16). The Russian Jewish artist Chaim Soutine (1893-1943), who spent most of his life in Paris, is best known for bloody, ecstatic paintings of beef carcasses. But it wasn't death that interested him -- it was the immaterial life force of the material world. Along with an instructive lineup of naked fowl, silver herring and popeyed sardines, this indispensable tribute to the transcendent but still undervalued painter centers on a stupendous 1925 ""Carcass of Beef,"" glistening scarlet, streaked with orange fat and straddling a starry sky. (Will Heinrich)

212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org 'THROUGH A DIFFERENT LENS: STANLEY KUBRICK PHOTOGRAPHS' at the Museum of the City of New York (through Oct. 28). This exhibition of the great director's photography is essentially Kubrick before he became Kubrick. Starting in 1945, when he was 17 and living in the Bronx, he worked as a photographer for Look magazine, and the topics that he explored are chestnuts so old that they smell a little moldy: lovers embracing on a park bench as their neighbors gaze ostentatiously elsewhere, patients anxiously awaiting their doctors appointment, boxing hopefuls in the ring, celebrities at home, pampered dogs in the city. It probably helped that Kubrick was just a kid, so instead of inducing yawns, these magazine perennials struck him as novelties, and he in turn brought something fresh to them. Photographs that emphasize the mise-en-scene could be movie stills: a shouting circus executive who takes up the right side of the foreground while aerialists rehearse in the middle distance, a boy climbing to a roof with the city tenements surrounding him, a subway car filled with sleeping passengers. Looking at these pictures, you want to know what comes next. (Arthur Lubow)

212-534-1672, mcny.org 'WORLD ON THE HORIZON: SWAHILI ARTS ACROSS THE INDIAN OCEAN' at the National Museum of African Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington (through Sept. 3). The Swahili coast of East Africa is home to a crossroads culture. For millenniums, the port cities in Somalia, Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique have been centers of long-distance trade and cultural exchange from multiple directions. To the west, they were anciently connected by caravan with Central Africa; to the east, by ship with India, China and Japan; to the north, with an Arab world that included Oman, Iran and Yemen; and to the south, via roundabout shipping routes with Europe and the Americas. This exhibition makes evident both the great beauty and the deep disturbance of those connections -- East Africa was a nodal point on the international slave trade. (Holland Cotter)

202-633-4600, africa.si.edu 'DAVID BOWIE IS' at Brooklyn Museum (through July 15). After a little over four months in Brooklyn, this world-touring tribute to pop's original chameleon comes to an end. Though fashion is the focal point of each section of the show, meriting equal attention are scores of supplemental objects, like a trunk full of Bowie's favorite novels and the two-faced rag doll video sculpture Tony Oursler made him for his 50th birthday celebration. For this final stop of the exhibition, 100 items were added, Melena Ryzik wrote in The New York Times, ""some of which have never been publicly shown."" These visual pieces are complemented by a soundtrack of news reports, interviews and music, delivered through a device that syncs with the displays as you move through the exhibition. Tickets are no longer available online, but there's a slim chance of gaining access in person on a first-come-first-served basis. (Danielle Dowling)

'LIKE LIFE: SCULPTURE, COLOR AND THE BODY (1300 TO NOW)' at the Met Breuer (through July 22). Taking a second run at the splashy theme-show extravaganza, the Met Breuer has greater success. This one is certainly more coherent since it centers entirely on the body and its role in art, science, religion and entertainment. It gathers together some 120 sculptures, dolls, artist's dummies, effigies, crucifixes and automatons. Many are rarely lent and may not return anytime soon. (Smith)

212-731-1675, metmuseum.org 'PAINTED IN MEXICO, 1700-1790: PINXIT MEXICI' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through July 22). Most religious art is visual theater, none more so than the great Roman Catholic Church paintings of 18th-century Mexico, which are at the center of this extraordinary exhibition, one of the high points of the season. Only within the past few decades has Spanish colonial art been awarded anything like center-stage status, and for reasons of unfamiliarity alone, the show is not to be missed. However, the real attraction is drama. You don't have to be religious to respond to a painterly tour de force like ""Apotheosis of the Eucharist"" by Rodriguez Juarez, which, like an organ chord, opens the show. Commissioned for the convent of Corpus Christi in Mexico City, the work's inspiration was as much political as devotional. (The convent was founded for Indian women of noble birth, at a time when ""noble"" and ""Indian"" were mutually exclusive concepts in much of Europe.) But what most matters about it now -- and surely did when it was new -- is its visionary imagery: the swirling clouds, the fainting saints, the angel-borne host that beams like a high-power flashlight. The show also features unforgettable portraits and cityscapes, though heaven remains the focal point. (Cotter)

 'ADRIAN PIPER: A SYNTHESIS OF INTUITIONS, 1965-2016' at the Museum of Modern Art (through July 22). A clarifying and complicating 50-year view of a major American artist's career, this exhibition is also an image-altering event for MoMA itself. It makes the museum feel like a more life-engaged institution than the formally polished one we're accustomed to. For the first time it has given over all of its sixth-floor special exhibition space to a single living female artist who is best known for her art about racism, and for good reason: It's powerful work, brilliantly varied in form. She has also consistently used her own image in inventive, distanced, self-mocking ways, as in two well-known self-likenesses done several years apart: one, a pencil drawing titled ""Self-Portrait Exaggerating My Negroid Features"" (1981); the other, a crayon-enhanced photograph called ""Self-Portrait as a Nice White Lady"" (1995). In these images, as in all of her work, her aim is not to assert racial identity but to destabilize the very concept of it. (Cotter)

Opinion,"If We Can't Test Everyone for Coronavirus, This Is the Next Best Thing",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/opinion/coronavirus-testing.html,"If We Can't Test Everyone for Coronavirus, This Is the Next Best Thing

We are flying blind in the fight against Covid-19. The number of cases is surely much greater than what we see and what is being relied on to provide direction for devising and implementing policy. But is the true number two to three times higher, as some experts say? More like 10 times, as other analysts calculate? Or perhaps as much as 50 to 100 times higher, as indicated by early random testing in Iceland; a population study of Vo, Italy; and some recent results in California? Every day, national leaders, governors, mayors and public health officials are making decisions that are among the most consequential of our lives, with the agony compounded by the magnitude of the unknowns. If we knew more, we could markedly improve health resource allocation and decisions about where, when and how we can safely reopen parts of the economy. Random population testing is the key to unlocking the mysteries surrounding Covid-19. The quantity of current testing still does not tell us what we need to know. Think about it this way: No one would rely on a poll of the Trump-Biden race, even of a large number of individuals, if everyone was queried at a Trump rally. With the coronavirus, most current testing is skewed toward the symptomatic and the sickest -- those who show up in E.R.s or otherwise seek tests, a group significantly, perhaps wildly, unrepresentative of the population.

Given our current capacity, random testing is the quickest, most feasible and most effective means of assessing the U.S. population. Ideally, we could test every American today, or over the next month, but even tens of millions of test kits would not accomplish this. We could triple the current number of tests under existing protocols, but we would remain in the dark about future hospital needs and when and how to relax restrictions on economic activity. Random testing uses but a sliver of that capacity to deliver immense value. And it can be done now, using incremental new capacity or at hospitals and universities that have capacity that remains idle because it is not yet authorized. It is the only way to get a true picture of prevalence, hospitalization and fatality rates and more. The recent Nobel in economic science went to Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer, researchers using random control trials, the mainstay of scientific medicine. Their work dramatizes how misleading it can be, for example, to measure disease prevalence by reference to those who seek treatment at rural health clinics, omitting the multitudes who have no access. Local random tests should be undertaken immediately. University researchers, working with local governments or operating independently, could conduct simple randomization, testing perhaps 5,000 or 10,000 individuals. We would quickly learn whether total cases were five times or 50 times current estimates in those areas.

Large-scale national random testing should also be started, with the goal of covering 200,000 individuals. Here, the aim is to be more systematic, comprehensive and strategic. Stratified random sampling -- which would assure a representative cross section -- could be refined using census data to help match the demographic and geographic composition of the U.S. population. Both the local and national programs should follow individuals who test positive for two weeks. Because these follow-ups would be on random population samples, we would have the first significant, direct evidence of hospitalization, intensive care and fatality rates attributable to Covid-19. Keep in mind that all current measures are limited to those who are tested, a highly unrepresentative -- and, in particular, much sicker -- sample. These random tests should be repeated periodically. Seeing how the true number of cases changes over time, particularly as states vary the intensity of their distancing policies, would be highly informative about both the disease and the policies. Indications that it is safe to proceed or that relaxation has overshot the mark and will once again inundate health facilities would be obtained sooner -- in the latter case before as much damage has been done. Random tests should also be accompanied by questionnaires. Subjects should be asked about symptoms, pre-existing conditions, occupation, demographics and their recent distancing experience. This would indicate the true asymptomatic rate, who is at what risk, the effectiveness of distancing policies by occupation (highly relevant for deciding who may safely return to work) and more. It is also essential that the data (in anonymized form) be made publicly available. Government agencies and health facilities should also post what they can -- consistent with privacy and resource constraints -- about testing intensities, test results, hospitalizations and outcomes by date, location, shutdown intensity, occupation, age and preconditions. Researchers today are frustrated by the difficulty in obtaining the data behind most empirical claims about the disease. Making public all the data from the random population studies and much existing data would unleash a torrent of epidemiologists, social scientists and data professionals throughout the world, a powerful battalion whose ammunition is data. Random testing would provide invaluable policy guidance. First, it would enable far better prediction of peak health care needs. We have seen frequent, dramatic revisions of projections that run only a week ahead. Yet much planning -- ramping up supplies, transforming facilities, moving thousands of patients -- requires more advanced and accurate notice. Widely used prediction models diverge and have inherent limitations, but they all suffer from a lack of reliable data. Knowing the true state of prevalence and the associated medical resource requirements would enable planners to avoid gross underprovision in some places and unnecessary but huge disruptions in others.

In addition, the information from random testing would allow decision makers to calibrate shutdowns and reopenings, recognizing that the present and future livelihoods of a large part of the population is at stake and that there is a crushing, disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable. To illustrate, suppose we were to learn that true cases are 10 times currently reported totals. This finding would imply that Covid-19 fatality rates and hospitalization and I.C.U. rates are a 10th as high as reported. Moreover, such differentials are probably far greater (even than is currently believed) for younger adults because their predominantly asymptomatic and less severe cases are much less likely to be tested. Data from Imperial College London already indicate that symptomatic individuals in their 20s and 30s have roughly a one-in-1,000 need for critical care. If random testing revealed that the true number of total cases for this age group -- symptomatic plus infected but not symptomatic -- is actually 10 times greater than just the symptomatic cases, their acute care needs would be under one in 10,000 -- so perhaps these tens of millions could be sent back to work safely, without inundating hospitals. If 50 million working Americans in their 20s and 30s eventually became infected, 5,000 across the entire country would need critical care, and not all at once. Right now, we do not know the true number of total cases even approximately. Nor the true hospitalization or fatality rates. We do not have a good sense of how current shutdowns affect the totals or how infection rates differ across occupations, including those deemed essential, where work continues. Random population data, including knowledge of age, pre-existing conditions, occupation and current isolation, would greatly illuminate these and other important questions.

Ms. Berke, an adjunct professor at Yale since 1987, can't remember the name of the student who did the green-and-blue abstraction, but she liked it enough to include it, along with a lithograph of Robert Indiana's 1969 image ""Skid Row."" The author and artist Edwin Schlossberg, a friend, gave her a text piece. ""His work always has to do with words, and I like that it says 'structure' -- good for an architect,"" she said.

Art & Design,What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/arts/design/what-to-see-in-new-york-art-galleries-this-week.html,"These days, when an American brand wants to drum up publicity, it offers some free swag to Instagram micro-celebrities, happy to prettify their performed ""real life"" with whatever product comes their way. A century ago, it was safer to call up an artist. Harold Haliday Costain (1897--1994), trained as an illustrator, became one of the most adroit commercial photographers of the 1930s -- providing American corporations with a bold, modern image that appeared nearly heroic in the years of the Depression. ""Sugar & Salt: Vintage Industrial Photographs by Harold Haliday Costain,"" at this photography space in the gallery-rich Fuller Building, includes two suites of his crisp, propulsive images of American industry. In 1934, he was commissioned by the International Salt Company to photograph its operations in Avery Island, La.; there Costain turned his camera on an angle to shoot vigorous views of a bare-armed laborer handling a hulking metal wheel, or a pristine metal helix grinding its way through evaporated salt. He also used lamps and spotlights to produce a dramatic view of a worker beneath a towering cliff of salt, so denuded and striated it appears almost like a lunar landscape. The photos of salt ran in the fledgling Fortune magazine; ""a white thread through history's tapestry,"" wrote the magazine's overawed reporter. Costain brought the same high-velocity modernism -- skewed angles, high contrast, shifting depth of field -- to photographs he took the next year of the facilities of the National Sugar Refining Company in New York and New Jersey. Hundreds of sacks of sugar tower over a worker, recalling levees or even sandbags fronting the trenches of the Great War. A woman on the assembly line looks on beneficently as boxes charge diagonally across the composition. Far from the cautious boosterism of contemporary annual reports, these sugar photos bear a strong resemblance to Soviet photography of the period, by the likes of Boris Ignatovich and Vsevolod Tarasevich. That such similar imagery could advertise such divergent economic systems attests to the slipperiness of photographic style -- and to the importance of looking past surfaces, even on the feeds of buffed-to-shine Instagrammers.

A good conceptual art piece is not very different from a joke, and Karl Haendel's got a million of 'em. His show ""Masses & Mainstream,"" at Mitchell-Innes & Nash, is a torrent of pencil drawings large and small, and all of them revolve, in one way or another, around the artist's ability to make anything in the world into a kind of punch line merely by pointing it out. There are old-fashioned gags like ""Doorway in a Box,"" a framed drawing of a wooden cupboard that sits on two wooden blocks on the floor, and ironic jokes about conceptual art, like the winkingly dumb ""Baby With Question Mark."" Jokes that adeptly split the difference include ""Richard Nixon's Childhood Home Annotated by My Daughter"" and ""Am I Jared Kushner?"" The first of these, a meticulous, four-foot-wide drawing of a photograph ornamented with childish doodles, captures the weird disconnect we often feel between public figures and their private lives; the second, simply a cursive list of similarities and differences between the artist and the president's son-in-law, sounds the very special anger and despair that Mr. Kushner elicits in progressive Jewish men. But it's the straighter drawings, many of them hugely oversize, that offer the most alluring take on the transformative power of self-conscious looking. In them the viewer has room to appreciate Mr. Haendel's relaxed confidence as a draftsman as well as the understated beauty of the found photographs he often uses as source material and of the graphite itself. ""Stacked Lawnmowers"" pictures four humdrum machines forming an unlikely monolith, and in ""Down Box (Football #10),"" a dense tangle of football players highlights the sensual appeal of a solid black background.

Lynette Yiadom-Boakye has contributed to the renaissance in painting the black figure and has benefited from it. Her show, ""In Lieu of a Louder Love"" at both of Jack Shainman's galleries in Chelsea, follows Charles White's landmark retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art and a new MoMA publication, ""Among Others: Blackness at MoMA,"" which includes Ms. Yiadom-Boakye's work. The game-changing exhibition ""Posing Modernity: The Black Model From Manet and Matisse to Today"" at the Wallach Art Gallery at Columbia University is still on view for a few weeks . Despite this momentum, however, Ms. Yiadom-Boakye, who won top honors at the Carnegie International exhibition last fall, still has room to grow as a painter. Her coffee-brown portraits of fictional people register best as groups, like an arrangement of family portraits. They feature people reading, lounging and resting in traditional poses. Her dark palette and the stillness of the figures gives her work a sense of timelessness that has fast-tracked them into contemporary art history: The work already looks timeworn. The flip side of this, however, is a sense of familiarity and inertness; Her subjects can feel trapped in the canvas rather than liberated by it. The best work here features laughing subjects and a hint of movement. Multiple panels with a female dancer in a white leotard, or a singular canvas with male dancers, suggest something beyond the here and now, a perspective on people, history and looking that you expect painting to elicit.",Harold Haliday Costain photographs the sugar and salt industries; Karl Haendel creates artistic punch lines; and Lynette Yiadom-Boakye ignites the unexpected.,025fcf93-be74-5f1d-9ca2-0718a9bf1216,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/18/arts/18galleries-costain/18galleries-costain-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=412&w=788&s=fc89943d16dd26fb70b9d1c47a7d0ea2ff7dc59925a9214eddd45e639ed7a750&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Harold Haliday Costain's &ldquo;Untitled (Sugar Sacks),&rdquo; a chlorobromide print from 1935.",025fcf93-be74-5f1d-9ca2-0718a9bf1216,N24News/imgs/025fcf93-be74-5f1d-9ca2-0718a9bf1216.jpg,14
Technology,U.S. Fines ZTE of China $1.19 Billion for Breaching Sanctions,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/07/technology/zte-china-fine.html,"HONG KONG -- As one of China's few truly international technology companies, ZTE is often held up by Beijing as part of a new generation of firms that is able to compete beyond Chinese borders.

On Tuesday, the United States government made an example of ZTE in a different way.

As part of a settlement for breaking sanctions and selling electronics to Iran and North Korea, ZTE agreed to plead guilty and pay $1.19 billion in fines, the United States Department of Commerce said in an announcement. The penalty is the largest criminal fine in a United States sanctions case.

The action is the latest in a series of skirmishes between the United States and China over technology policy. It also offered a chance for President Trump's young administration to make a statement about the seriousness of United States sanctions. In addition to ZTE, the Commerce Department is also investigating the company's larger Chinese rival, Huawei, for violating United States sanctions.

""We are putting the world on notice: The games are over,"" said Commerce Secretary Wilbur L. Ross. ""Those who flout our economic sanctions and export control laws will not go unpunished -- they will suffer the harshest of consequences.""",The Chinese technology company agreed to plead guilty to charges that it broke United States sanctions and sold electronics to Iran and North Korea.,acbb1a9c-29b5-5f82-92ab-1b50ada032f5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/08/business/08chinasanctions1/08chinasanctions1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=9a946e9282e398217f0ba36b626288cd9544e76879b7a820486de09f12ed78b5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Visitors used ZTE devices during the Mobile World Congress 2017 on Feb. 27 in Barcelona.

Fashion & Style,"Diversity, of All Kinds, Is on the Rise at Fashion Shows",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/fashion/new-york-fashion-week-2017-diversity.html,"If it seemed as though the runways in New York, London, Milan and Paris were more diverse than usual this season, that's because they were. A new report compiled by The Fashion Spot, which assessed 241 shows, found that 27.9 percent of the models who walked the fall 2017 runways were minorities, the highest proportion recorded since The Fashion Spot began tracking the data two and a half years ago. New York, where 31.5 percent of the models were nonwhite, led the charge, and Milan came in last. All of the shows that the report looked at in New York included at least one model of color, and all five of the shows that ranked highest for racial diversity across the four cities were held in New York (Gypsy Sport, Chromat, Kimora Lee Simmons, Yeezy and Marc Jacobs).

In its first reports, The Fashion Spot looked only at racial diversity, but it later began assessing size, age and transgender identity as well. ""We kept adding categories as attitudes changed,"" Ms. Davidson said. ""As more calls for racial diversity started, there were calls also for different sizes. Age and transgender identity haven't gotten as much visibility, but we thought it was important to highlight those in order to make sure the runways become more representative of the population buying the clothes."" This season, there were 12 transgender models, and 21 women aged 50 or older. Thirty plus-size models walked the runways, up from 16 last season and six the season before that, though most of the appearances were in New York. Ashley Graham -- who is becoming something of a supermodel, with history-making appearances on the covers of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, and of British and American Vogue -- became the first plus-size model to walk in a Michael Kors show (she was also the only plus-size model in the show). Nonetheless, Sara Ziff, the founder of the Model Alliance, a labor advocacy organization that recently published a study on ""extreme thinness standards in the fashion industry,"" believes there is plenty of room for improvement across all of the categories.

After all, though the number of plus-size models has grown, it still makes up fewer than 1 percent of the castings. And though many labels featured at least some models of color, several -- Junya Watanabe, Undercover and Trussardi -- included none, and many others had just a few.

""There's still a lot of tokenism,"" Ms. Ziff said. ""It's the designer or casting director trying to check the inclusivity box, and that is problematic for the models. They go to a casting, and they're told, 'We've already cast a black model.'"" Tokenism can play out on a larger scale as well, giving the impression that the industry is transforming, when in reality, the changes are small. For example, in early March, Vogue published an article with the headline ""Was Fall 2017 the Season Curves Conquered the Runways?"" It was a record-breaking season, true, but only 11 shows included plus-size models (two of them, Christian Siriano and Chromat, accounted for half of those appearances), and three of them featured the same two women, Candice Huffine and Marquita Pring. Similarly, Ms. Aden made headlines for wearing a hijab while walking in several shows, including Yeezy and Max Mara. However, she was one model. Whether her appearance was an exception or a precursor to more inclusion is something only time will tell. Gilleon Smith, the casting director for Chromat, which had five plus-size and five transgender models (and more models of color than white models), thinks that there is plenty of talent for designers to choose from and that making the runways more inclusive is entirely within their power. ""Sometimes the line at our castings is wrapped around the block,"" she said. ""It's up to the designers to make those decisions. They drive the ship.""","More than a quarter of the models who walked in the fall 2017 shows were minorities, a report found.",df7c77bc-1b17-5bf5-ab4e-1c8ea9922c54,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/16/fashion/16DIVERSITY2/16DIVERSITY2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=76ba80ef739bafed4dbe3cbc821514ca906956ae5f27e6b9ce62ec6f92c79213&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Backstage at the fall 2017 Gypsy Sport show in New York.

Global Business,Book Publishers Scramble for Chinese Readers,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/22/business/global/22chinabook.html,"BEIJING -- Star-crossed love between Alexander the Great and his teenage male slave. Ferocious battles that defined an empire. The bloodshed and romance of Ancient Greece. The novel ""The Persian Boy,"" by Mary Renault, has it all. In the West, the book, which is filled with scenes of pederasty and homosexual passion, raises a few eyebrows nearly four decades after it was first published. But in China, where omnipotent censors regularly smother sensitive content and portrayals of sexuality are illegal, one would think a book like this would never make it to the bookstore shelf, let alone past a publisher's desk. Well, think again. When Zheng Yuantao, a 30-year-old translator, came upon the English version in 2005, he set out to bring this tale to the Chinese readership in a language they could understand. ""My goal was to translate a positive gay love story for Chinese people to see as a role model,"" he said on a recent afternoon near his home in Beijing.

Two years after he first approached a Chinese publisher, Horizon Media, with the project, he celebrated his success at the book's introductory party this past August, signing copies for a line of eager readers. A second printing of 5,000 copies ran in November following a first run of 10,000. Mr. Zheng's triumph marks a stunning shift in Chinese society as the country's headlong economic development has brought new liberalization and ideas to its shores. While film, radio and television remain squarely under the thumb of the Chinese government, the book industry has steadily become more open. With tastes growing more sophisticated and worldly, foreign book publishers have leapt at the opportunity to attract new readers among China's growing middle class. Although certain subjects like the Dalai Lama, Taiwan independence, dark episodes in Communist history and overtly religious themes remain verboten -- and are deleted from translated editions of foreign titles -- the hunger for literature, business advice and self-help books has fueled a scramble among Chinese publishers and their international counterparts to translate classics and the latest best sellers into Chinese, creating new opportunities for book agents and translators to help bridge the gap between East and West.

Horizon Media, part of the Shanghai Century Publishing Group, was founded in 2002 with a mission to publish social science books and had no literature department. But it has adapted deftly to the evolving demand, now publishing about 150 titles a year, 70 percent of which come from outside mainland China. The company sells novels for between 20 and 36 renminbi, or $3 and $5.40
* The head of Instagram agrees to testify as Congress probes the app's effects on young people.
* Today in On Tech: A fix-it job for government tech. Wang Ling, Horizon's chief literature editor, cites as a turning point the company's publishing of ""The Da Vinci Code"" in 2003, of which two million copies have been printed here, followed by the huge success of ""The Kite Runner,"" with 800,000 in print -- astronomical numbers in a country where, Ms. Wang says, only ""super-best sellers"" reach half a million copies. The quality of a translation plays a major role in a foreign title's success in China, so Horizon takes great care to hire someone with an ear for language and a contemporary voice that readers will enjoy. ""A good translator is not just fluent in the source language but must also know how to write an eloquent Chinese sentence,"" Ms. Wang said. Frequently, Horizon turns to Li Jihong, a 30-year-old from Shanghai who has translated 20 books, including ""The Kite Runner,"" ""A Thousand Splendid Suns"" and the ""Conversations With God"" series, as well as works by Clive Cussler and Margaret Atwood. He usually translates each book in a few days, with a dictionary by his side for obscure terms. ""You have to see through the words in the original language and get what the author wants to say, and then find an accurate and decent way of expressing it in Chinese,"" he said. Sometimes, however, an authentic translation runs afoul of the Chinese government, and then changes must be made. In ""The Kite Runner,"" references to the Soviets' disastrous meddling in Afghanistan were removed, as it was deemed to tarnish the Communist brand, as was a glowing mention of the government's arch-nemesis, the Dalai Lama, in the book ""Communion With God."" Mr. Li loved the ""Conversations With God"" series so much that he bought the Chinese rights, which also ensured that no editor could change his translation. The first book stayed on the Amazon China top-100 best-seller list for a year after it was first published. It is a constant affirmation to Mr. Li, who thinks these books can benefit Chinese society because they ""awaken the conscience of the powerful and bring consolation to the powerless,"" he said.

Of course, translators alone do not bring foreign books to China. The Big Apple agency, the mainland's largest, represents publishers and imprints from around the world seeking to license book titles to the more than 1,000 publishers it works with in China. Big Apple handles the legwork, which includes sending samples, negotiating offer terms and tracking royalty payments, for which it generally receives a 10 percent cut. The agency said it sealed more than 2,000 contracts in 2009 and expected that number to increase this year. Contracts can be lucrative -- last week Big Apple resold J.D. Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye"" for more than $200,000. Big Apple and other agencies also make sure publishers' intellectual property does not fall into the wrong hands in China, which has a notorious record for ignoring copyright laws. ""All too often do we hear stories where proprietors send book samples to publishers directly and never hear back from them,"" said Wendy King, vice president of Big Apple. To safeguard material, the agency keeps a log of lent review samples, sends out only partial electronic files of manuscripts for review and notes which publishers have bad credit or fail to promptly provide royalty statements. However, she says, the legal environment in China has improved, and ""following the copyright laws is now the norm rather than the exception."" Western publishers are flocking to China, with many opening offices in Beijing and Shanghai and mobbing Chinese publishers at international book fairs. HarperCollins says its number of deals and revenue from those sales have more than doubled over the last three years, mostly in the business and self-help categories: Donald Trump's ""Think Big in Business and Life"" and Jack Welch's ""Winning"" being two of the most successful titles. All this gives both foreign and domestic Chinese publishers confidence that the industry will become increasingly free and lucrative. That books like ""The Persian Boy,"" ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""The Kite Runner"" caused some jitters over their controversial themes yet were published and then became popular reveals a nation willing to push boundaries and a government growing more at ease with foreign ideas, says Ms. Wang, the Horizon Media editor. ""The industry is driven by a desire to pursue profit,"" she said. ""Because society at large is liberalizing, readers demand different books, so we take the risk and hope it pays off.""","With censorship easing and tastes growing more sophisticated, foreign book publishers have seized on an opportunity for readers in China's middle class.",b55c6239-7959-517f-aa9a-7a939ba40afc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/12/22/business/global/22chinabook-span/22chinabook-span-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=345&w=600&s=8da1ec25b539589110293616b5e28768023e831e662a1099b05264ca704e33cf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Wang Ling, chief literature editor of Horizon Media, which now publishes about 150 titles a year, 70 percent of which come from outside mainland China.",b55c6239-7959-517f-aa9a-7a939ba40afc,N24News/imgs/b55c6239-7959-517f-aa9a-7a939ba40afc.jpg,24
Movies,"'David Crosby: Remember My Name' Review: Highs, Lows and Hanging On",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/movies/david-crosby-remember-my-name-review.html,"The new documentary "" David Crosby: Remember My Name "" finds its subject in fine voice. A graying walrus of a man who favors knitted skullcaps and blue jeans held up with suspenders, he is a prodigious talker and still a terrific singer, having lost remarkably little of his vocal range after more than a half century of not always taking the best care of himself. The anxiety latent in the title of the film, directed by A.J. Eaton, seems misplaced. Crosby's name is affixed to two supergroups -- one with Neil Young, one without -- whose close harmonies and open-chord, acoustic-guitar-driven sound are fixtures of many a parental and grandparental playlist. Teach your children well!

You'll hear some of the classic CSN and CSNY hits, as well as some from the Byrds, Crosby's first important band, wrapped around stories and gossip from the old days. Monterey Pop. Woodstock. Laurel Canyon. Among Crosby's talents was a knack for being in the right place at the right time, surrounded by musicians and hangers-on who could be counted on to keep the jam sessions and parties going.

Though the camera follows him out on the road in 2017, during a solo concert tour, the emphasis is on the glory years of the late '60s and '70s, and on the train wreck that followed. The present-day interviews are conducted by Cameron Crowe (a producer of the film), who as a young music journalist was around for some of the highs and the lows. (At one point he plays a recording of a conversation with Crosby from 1974.)","Fans will enjoy the backstage access to a Rock Hall of Famer, but much about Crosby's life remains obscure in this documentary.",e8a2fb9a-825c-5264-8bea-a0fddc1b30c1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/17/arts/17davidcrosby1/merlin_157859052_1eacabd4-40ab-4cf8-855b-0a141d158c95-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=b2e1be268de9e195fe658bbad5b1b8b299330d80fd4be167d5031e32c5e4bc33&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A scene from ""David Crosby: Remember My Name,"" a documentary directed by A.J.

Music,A Singer for Whom Words Always Came First,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/arts/music/sanford-sylvan-appraisal.html,"On a late summer afternoon in 1993 at my house in Cambridge, Mass., the baritone Sanford Sylvan and I spent hours rehearsing a short piece: Virgil Thomson's ""Pigeons on the Grass Alas,"" with words by Gertrude Stein. The final section of this ""recitative and air,"" as Thomson called it, is like a nonsensical yet glorious religious proclamation: ""Foundationally marvelously aboundingly illimitably with it as a circumstance."" Sandy -- everyone who worked with him knew this most principled, compelling and collegial singer, who died last week at 65, as Sandy -- sang it just that way, lifting the words with robust sound and elation. After one run-through, during the final phrase, ""Fundamentally and saints,"" Sandy plunged down the scale to end on a sustained, hearty low C.

For a moment he was quiet. Then he said something curious: ""And people say I don't have low notes,"" speaking as much to himself as to me. Perhaps Sandy had gotten tired of hearing his eloquent lightness and clarity in the upper range praised. He was also commanding, both in voice and stage presence, and could summon bass power when called for, as he did that afternoon.

We were preparing ""Pigeons,"" for baritone and piano, for an album of Thomson vocal works, most of them little-known, that I was making for Northeastern Records with an excellent group of Boston-area singers. I listened to it again last week following the news of his death. I didn't know Sandy that well. We'd fallen out of touch in recent years. Yet making music together fosters a lasting intimacy between people.

I'll never forget his chillingly clear performance of the scene when romantic frustration drives Orlando to a harrowing mental breakdown. And I saw him in other landmark Sellars stagings: Mozart's ""Le Nozze di Figaro,"" set in Trump Tower in New York, and ""Cosi Fan Tutte,"" moved to a roadside diner. Sandy once told me that he felt ""born to do"" this kind of opera, to take part in productions that looked deep into standard works to find contemporary resonances. If he never performed at the Metropolitan Opera, he said, so be it. And he never did. What he was doing took courage and mattered just as much as the Met, if not more.

Before working together, we had mingled in Boston's close-knit musical community. He had heard me perform in concerts. Still, I was a little surprised that he jumped at my offer to participate in the Thomson project. One of his assignments was ""Capital Capitals,"" another Gertrude Stein setting, for four male singers and piano. With some 3,000 words, the text vaguely evokes the French region of Provence -- its landscape, food, and customs -- in the form of a conversation between four cities: Aix, Arles, Avignon and Les Baux. What drew him to our project? Words. It was always words with Sandy. Whether the texts were somber or fanciful, poignant or impish, words came first. This was clear when he spoke about John Adams's ""The Wound-Dresser,"" written for him in 1989. The text is a Walt Whitman poem, a reflection on tending sick and wounded soldiers during the Civil War.

Of course, he meant it was a privilege to sing Whitman's words as set to music by Mr. Adams, perhaps his most important collaborator; Sandy created the roles of Chou En-lai in ""Nixon in China"" and the title role in ""The Death of Klinghoffer."" But it was communicating the words that came first; after his death, Mr. Adams tellingly paid tribute to the way Sandy ""made our American language a thing of beauty whenever he sang it."" As a deeply spiritual person who took periodic sabbaticals to study Judaism and Buddhism, Sandy was touched by the hints of Christian mysticism that seem to run through ""Pigeons on the Grass Alas."" Thomson fashioned this concert piece from passages of his opera ""Four Saints in Three Acts."" The opera vaguely suggests the life of a group of 16th-century Spanish saints, and all the words for ""Pigeons"" come from lines that St. Ignatius sings. It begins with a solemn invocation. Over a low, soft D octave in the piano, the baritone sings a long melodic line that keeps leaping up and then descending on the notes of a D major scale, with what might seem baffling words: ""A scene and withers,"" ""Why when in lean fairly rejoin place dismiss calls."" Come again? But Sandy sang it as if it were a truth imparted to him directly from God.","Sanford Sylvan, the American baritone who died last week at 65, once worked with our critic on a recording of vocal pieces by Virgil Thomson.",805ea685-556a-5908-922a-48cd105102f1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/09/arts/09baritone1-print/09baritone-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=04d9983bd147a90d5392b7f4cbd38ee0afcdf896050ec425d5ae096b557d86f8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The baritone Sanford Sylvan, who died last week, was a principled, compelling and collegial singer, our critic writes.",805ea685-556a-5908-922a-48cd105102f1,N24News/imgs/805ea685-556a-5908-922a-48cd105102f1.jpg,12
Travel,"In Los Angeles, Ditching the Car for an Eco-Friendly Trip",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/24/travel/budget-travel-los-angeles.html,"Los Angeles may feature an abundance of holistic arts, yoga and macrobiotic diets, but it's probably not the first city that comes to mind when you hear the term ""eco-friendly."" You can largely thank the 900 miles of freeways and highways in Los Angeles County for that. Few would dispute that the city's culture is a car-dominated one, with an obsessive focus on driving routes, smog alerts and the best times of day to avoid traffic. It's an obsession that has been mocked on ""Saturday Night Live,"" captured in pop songs and recorded in academic essays. It's possible, though, to escape the routines of the typical visitor in the name of environmental friendliness. I set out to marry the city's organic cuisine and healthy, active lifestyle with something that it isn't widely associated with -- leaving a small carbon footprint -- by ditching the car and creature comforts of regular hotels. I discovered that it's possible to rely on the Metro, Los Angeles's imperfect but quite functional public transportation system, which includes buses, a light rail system and, yes, even a subway. I was able to find a comfortable yurt -- that's right, the traditional Central Asian round tent -- in a quiet, wooded part of the city accessible by light rail and just minutes from downtown. And all while saving some money in the process. My girlfriend, Brette, and I rode the long escalator into the bowels of the subway station at Santa Monica Boulevard and Vermont Avenue. ""Wow,"" she said, ""I can't believe this exists."" It does feel strange to ride the subway in Los Angeles because it dispels the one huge stereotype nearly everyone subscribes to: that you need a car to get around. ""And it's so quiet and clean,"" she said, touching her Metro Tap card to the turnstile (subtracting the $1.75 fare) and going through.

The platform was mostly empty. The limitations of the subway quickly become apparent in that there are only two lines, purple and red, which basically cover the same route. The red line goes from downtown through Koreatown, into Hollywood, before terminating in North Hollywood. If you happen to live within walking distance of one of the 14 stations on the line, and your destination is also on that line, then the subway is supremely useful. But most of the approximately 500 square miles of the city remain unserved by the lines. Bus and light rail lines are more comprehensive and help pick up the slack.

Pershing Square, in the heart of downtown, is, however, one of the subway stops, and it deposits you just a block or so from one of the city's major culinary destinations: Grand Central Market. It was founded as a large open-air arcade in 1917, and can still feel like a market at businesses like Torres Produce and Chiles Secos. But in recent years it's morphed into its current incarnation: a big, vibrant food hall peppered with a selection of popular restaurants. Opening a place or holding an event at Grand Central is an immediate notch in the belt of any Los Angeles chef. Food prices have naturally skyrocketed, but some good deals can be found. One of the best is the Fast Burger from Belcampo ($5), built in the In-N-Out style: American cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and a Thousand Island-style sauce. The quality of the grass-fed beef is what makes this burger a bargain; natural juices run immodestly from the freshly ground patty, perfectly complementing the vegetables.

The feel of downtown Los Angeles is unflinchingly urban -- mere miles away, though, lies an entirely different world. We made our way to Union Station, the city's rail hub and the largest railroad terminal in the Western United States. A gorgeous, soaring structure erected in the 1930s, its architecture mixes bits and pieces of Art Deco and Mission Revival styles. We found the Metro Gold Line (also $1.75 on the same Tap card), one of the city's four light rail lines. It was uncharacteristically drizzly, and those of us waiting for the Azusa-bound line squeezed under the shelter on the outdoor platform. The announcement board said the train would be arriving in four minutes. Four minutes passed, then another four. Then another four. The platform was becoming crowded. Finally, it arrived. About 15 minutes later, we stepped out in the Mount Washington neighborhood and began the 10-minute walk to our lodgings. I found our yurt on Airbnb for $98 a night. It's essentially a big, round tent with a front and back door; a latticelike structure braces the frame. Wooden ribs support the dome, and at the top is a covered translucent wheel, or crown, that acts like a circular skylight. It's quite beautiful, and the luxuries -- a proper queen-size bed, for example, as well as electricity -- give the illusion of camping without any of the real down-and-dirty stuff. It turns out that while I find saying the word ""glamping"" to be slightly nauseating, the actual act is very pleasant.

The yurt is set on a raised platform in a quiet, hilly section of Mount Washington, a neighborhood in northeast Los Angeles known for its steep and winding streets. The owners left the keys and some lovely touches: tea and coffee, an electric kettle, a French press, even a bottle of inexpensive wine. There were travel books in the night stand, as well as a small portable heater. The back door led to the outdoor bathroom and shower area, with a dry composting toilet (and instructions for how to use it) as well as a sink and shower with a ""gray water"" system (it runs off and feeds the plants in the garden; the hosts provide all-natural soap). Using the outdoor shower was one of the highlights of the stay: I was expecting to take a quick, freezing shower and immediately towel off and run back inside. But the water heater worked well, and I was able to take a relaxing, warm shower in the drizzly, 50-degree weather, right next to an enormous prickly pear cactus on the hillside.

While the city's public transit system proved mostly reliable, I decided to try other transportation options. CicLAvia is an initiative that creates daylong open-streets events for biking, skating and walking. The aim is to get people to explore their neighborhoods by means other than cars by creating large, open public spaces out of Los Angeles's streets. ""L.A. is mostly known for destination points -- you go from point A to point B,"" said Romel Pascual, executive director of CicLAvia. ""You do that in a car and you miss everything in between. This makes you slow down and appreciate the in-between moments."" My brother, Loren, in town for a visit, and I decided we would rent bikes and participate in the San Fernando Valley edition of CicLAvia. We met at Retro Xpress Bicycles on Victory Boulevard and asked for two day rentals. ""Well,"" the man behind the counter said, pursing his lips, ""we don't have many bikes left."" He stopped and pointed at two pink girls' bikes that were way too small. ""This is all we got left."" I couldn't tell if he was just trolling me or if he was serious. He was serious. We walked out with the two bright pink bikes and two helmets for $19.95 apiece. The ride up to the corner of Van Nuys and Roscoe, where the event began, was mostly uneventful -- we did get a few honks, hoots and hollers from passing cars. Once we were in the confines of the four-mile stretch of CicLAvia, no one cared. The entire boulevard was closed to traffic, and tents and food trucks were set up along the sidewalks. It was a giant street fair; there were lots of pets, children and residents of all ages. Many were biking, others conversing and getting to know one another. Mr. Pascual was right -- it was enlightening to slow down and get an up-close perspective on the neighborhood, all while strengthening a sense of community. I had covered four of the five major alternatives to cars in Los Angeles: foot, bike, subway, light rail. That left the bus. Brette and I embarked on an epic trip (Line 733) from downtown to Venice one afternoon -- it was a good 80 to 90 minutes to make the 14.5-mile haul and reach the big roundabout near Main Street and Venice Way, just steps from the Venice Boardwalk.","Contrary to reputation, it's possible to escape the routines of the typical visitor in the name of environmental friendliness.",e6662804-65f4-593e-aff4-6302808c64d9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/24/travel/24FRUGAL1/24FRUGAL1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=b982dbe8c6f4ad792a5ce7932b448f75d886084d33514105a46fa4eef71d3523&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Bikers at Venice Beach.,e6662804-65f4-593e-aff4-6302808c64d9,N24News/imgs/e6662804-65f4-593e-aff4-6302808c64d9.jpg,4
Movies,"'Police Story,' When Jackie Chan Swung Into Action",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/movies/jackie-chan-police-story-alamo-drafthouse.html,"Indeed, ""Police Story"" -- which Chan directed as well as starred in as a diligent but absent-minded cop -- would be little more than a bang-bang procedural were it not for a number of impossibly kinetic set pieces. The scene in which Chan, who did all of his own stunts, employs the handle of an umbrella to hang on to a moving bus is easier to describe than the gyrations he uses to confound six bad guys armed with clubs or ride a large shopping mall chandelier down to the ground. The sound of broken glass is Chan's theme song. His directorial stunts are epitomized by a choreographed sequence that destroys an entire hillside shantytown.

""Police Story"" is largely the sum of its action scenes although it's also enjoyable to watch the villains wield cellphones the size of cinder blocks, or see the very young Maggie Cheung as Chan's long-suffering girlfriend. (Brigitte Lin, another leading Hong Kong star, is also in the movie as the witness whom Chan's police officer must protect.)

""Police Story II,"" showing as a separate admission, appears never to have been reviewed in The Times. Production values are higher and the havoc quotient is lower, despite several elaborate explosions. The tiresome toilet humor is partly compensated for by some impressively orchestrated gags -- involving chain reactions worthy of Rube Goldberg -- and a fireworks display that brings down the abandoned factory where the final battle is staged.

The best part of a Chan production can be the humorous montage of outtakes that accompany the closing credits. As if to offset the diminished violence in ""Police Story II,"" the coda shows real injuries and actual blood.","The Asian action star, the Fred Astaire of outrageous mayhem, returns in his digitally restored breakthrough movies.",c6aa8c1c-4582-54c5-93f9-f2e42d0ee66d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/01/arts/01rewind1/merlin_149756217_bde61db3-58b7-4fd0-a369-d4c0a25b8b0d-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=c5d686bef79e8c1f5757e5cc6ca800ad912cac056fca3bac67fd951e49f8faa1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jackie Chan, who performed all of his own stunts, uses an umbrella to latch on to the outside of a moving bus in &ldquo;Police Story.&rdquo;",c6aa8c1c-4582-54c5-93f9-f2e42d0ee66d,N24News/imgs/c6aa8c1c-4582-54c5-93f9-f2e42d0ee66d.jpg,5
Real Estate,Reshaping Midtown East,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/02/realestate/new-condos-coming-to-midtown-east.html,"Every neighborhood has its stepchild, an overlooked swath that does not receive as much attention as surrounding blocks. For Midtown East, that area is around East 57th Street near Bloomingdale's, a strip with neither the commercial bustle found farther south, nor the rarefied character of its decidedly residential neighbors Sutton Place and the Upper East Side. But several new developments could soon give the area a residential flavor all its own. Spurred by the success of trophy skyscrapers like 432 Park Avenue, developers are planning luxury residential towers that could reshape the area between Park Avenue and Second Avenue from 57th Street to 60th Street. At the corner of Second Avenue, sales recently began at 252 East 57th Street, a 65-story residential tower. And at 520 Park Avenue, on the edge of the Upper East Side at 60th Street, a 54-story limestone tower designed by Robert A. M. Stern Architects is rising with a triplex penthouse priced at a jaw-dropping $130 million. Developers are also assembling parcels around Bloomingdale's while new developments rise in the lower 60s, blurring the boundary between Midtown East and the Upper East Side. ""It is an area that has kind of been forgotten and not developed as much in recent years,"" said Gabby Warshawer, the director of research and communications for CityRealty. ""It's finally having its day.""

The World Wide Group, which is developing 252 East 57th Street with Rose Associates, hopes to attract Upper East Side buyers looking for new construction, as well as international buyers. The 65-story tower will include 93 condominiums beginning on the 36th floor, so all these units will enjoy desirable city views. The lower half of the building will include 173 luxury rentals. Prices for condos start at $4.5 million for a two-bedroom, and the penthouse, which is not on the market yet, will be listed for $37.5 million. Other units include a five-bedroom listed for $21.25 million. For another $250,000, residents can buy a parking spot. Prices have not been set for the rentals, which will begin leasing closer to the time the building opens in late 2016. ""It's the new start of the Upper East Side,"" said Pamela D'Arc, an agent at Stribling and Associates who is marketing the development. The temptation to draw Midtown into the Upper East Side's fold can be hard to resist. After all, sellers obtain much higher prices for properties with Upper East Side addresses. In the third quarter, the average sale price for a residential property in Midtown East was $1.161 million, nearly half of the $2.236 million during the same period on the Upper East Side, according to data provided by CityRealty. ""At this point, East 57th Street is becoming the Upper East Side,"" said Tamir Shemesh, an agent at the Corcoran Group who is marketing several new developments in the vicinity. ""It's like Tokyo and Yokohama -- they used to be far from each other and now they're one big city."" The residential tower at 252 East 57th Street is the final stage of an effort by World Wide, starting in 2005, to redevelop a one-and-a-half-acre site that now includes two public schools and a Whole Foods. With three floors of retail planned for the tower, World Wide hopes the project will transform the unremarkable corner into the East Side's answer to the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle. Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, the architects for the Time Warner Center, also designed 252 East 57th Street, which will have an undulating glass curtain wall so every condo apartment and some rentals will have at least one window that curves inward. ""We see this as an eastern version"" of the Time Warner Center, said Julia Hodgson, the director of development for World Wide. ""It's all one residential corridor.""

Not everyone is convinced that a Whole Foods and a few more shops could reinvent Second Avenue the way that the Time Warner Center invigorated Columbus Circle when it opened in 2004. ""We've had such big hopes for that Whole Foods, but half of the time it's empty,"" said Victoria Vinokur, an agent with Halstead Property who also lives in Midtown East. ""There's nothing else in the radius."" A handful of restaurants like the Smith and Crave Fishbar have opened along Second Avenue around 50th Street, replacing check-cashing shops and unmemorable Irish pubs with more sophisticated eateries. But the blocks farther north still feel like an afterthought. ""It's not an easy street to maintain a business on, because it doesn't get the foot traffic and the rents are quite high,"" said Paul Anavian, the manager of Manhattan Arts and Antiques Center, which has been on Second Avenue since 1975.

Businesses have an easier time farther west. Tres Carnes, a popular downtown barbecue taco restaurant, opened an outpost on Third Avenue and 57th Street this spring. And Spa Castle Premier 57 plans to open a three-story luxury spa at 57th Street and Park Avenue in late November. On East 60th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, World Wide plans to build a residential development across from Bloomingdale's. ""That will also be a tall tower,"" said Ms. Hodgson, adding that it would ""be a similar type of development"" to the East 57th Street project. To make way for the tower, World Wide has been steadily assembling low-rise buildings on the block, including the building that houses the Subway Inn, a beloved dive bar that has been in its location for 77 years. But World Wide did not renew the bar's lease and on Dec. 2, the storied tavern is scheduled to close and later move to a new location on Second Avenue and 60th street, two blocks away. ""This whole block is changing left and right,"" said Steven Salinas, whose father, Arsemio, owns the Subway Inn. ""Everybody wants to make a lot of money and the city's letting them do that, and they don't care too much about the mom-and-pop places.""

More blocks might soon amass the ubiquitous sidewalk bridges and cranes that have come to symbolize an era of endless construction. On Third Avenue from 58th to 59th Streets, Harry Macklowe, the developer of 432 Park Avenue, bought three properties just north of the Decoration and Design Building earlier this year. He recently partnered with Keppel Land, a Singapore developer, to redevelop the parcel, which will include residential and retail. ""It's not going to be 432 Park,"" said Mr. Shemesh of Corcoran, who is familiar with the Third Avenue development. ""You can't compare a project on Third Avenue with Park Avenue, and it certainly won't be in that price level."" In the low East 60s, several residential developments are also underway, including a 30-story tower at 1059 Third Avenue and a 19-story residential development at 301 East 61st Street. Later this year, sales are expected to begin at 337 East 62nd Street, a seven-story, 22-unit boutique condo developed by Yeung Real Estate Development. Prices will start at around $700,000 for a 600-square-foot one-bedroom, and the largest apartment, a three-bedroom duplex with a garden, will be listed for around $3 million, according to Mr. Shemesh, who is marketing the property. Although developers insist they have discovered untapped potential in the area, others see it more as development following the path of least resistance. ""I don't think there's a strategy other than this is where we can assemble land,"" said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. ""It's the site first and concept later.""",Developers are planning luxury residential towers that may reshape Midtown East between Park Avenue and Second Avenue from 57th Street to 60th Street.,915a543a-498e-56d8-abd0-a4c9dc856544,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/02/realestate/02JPEAST1/02JPEAST1-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2014&h=335&w=600&s=bafd57a408df8a9c5335653430e5f28d324cffb04e9f75b8ef036c2fd033d722&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A 65-story glass tower, left, is rising at the scaffolded corner of Second Avenue and 57th Street.",915a543a-498e-56d8-abd0-a4c9dc856544,N24News/imgs/915a543a-498e-56d8-abd0-a4c9dc856544.jpg,7
Health,The Zika Virus Is Still a Threat. Here's What the Experts Know.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/health/zika-virus.html,"With measles and Ebola grabbing headlines, it is easy to forget the health panic of 2016, when Zika was linked to severe birth defects in thousands of Brazilian newborns whose mothers were infected while pregnant, striking fear across the country and much of the Americas. As health officials struggled to halt its spread, the virus galloped through Latin America and the Caribbean that spring and summer and eventually reached the United States, sickening more than 200 people in Florida and Texas and prompting countless travelers to cancel vacations in the tropics. Then, seemingly overnight, the epidemic evaporated and public attention moved on. But Zika, it turns out, did not vanish. ""Zika has completely fallen off the radar, but the lack of media attention doesn't mean it's disappeared,"" said Dr. Karin Nielson, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at U.C.L.A. who studies Zika's impact in Brazil. ""In some ways, the situation is a bit more dangerous because people aren't aware of it.""

The virus, which is mostly spread by mosquitoes but also through sex with an infected person, is still circulating in Brazil and other countries that were at the center of the epidemic, and two years ago the same strain from the Americas arrived in continental Africa for the first time. That strain, researchers recently discovered, had been causing birth defects in Asia long before the Zika epidemic of 2016. Another concern is over places where the mosquito that spreads the virus -- the female Aedes aegypti -- is endemic but have so far been spared locally transmitted cases of Zika. On Tuesday, the World Health Organization issued a report on Zika that listed 61 such countries, among them densely populated behemoths like China, Egypt and Pakistan as well as much of Africa. [Here's what you should know about Zika and travel.] Even Brazil remains vulnerable: The 2016 epidemic largely spared the country's south and most notably Sao Paulo, its biggest city. Warming temperatures associated with climate change are expected to expand the range of Aedes, according to a recent study, putting tens of millions more people at risk for Zika and other mosquito-borne diseases. ""The next outbreak is not a matter of if, but when,"" said Dr. Ernesto T.A. Marques, a public health researcher at The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro who is also an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh.

""It also helps that people in the U.S. tend to live fairly far apart in single-family homes,"" said Dr. Lyle R. Petersen, who oversees vector-borne diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""This is a mosquito that doesn't fly very far."" While the number of new cases of Zika so far is small -- last year there were nearly 20,000 infections in Brazil compared to more than 200,000 during the epidemic's peak -- countries like Angola, Thailand, Vietnam and Cape Verde have reported newborns with Zika-related microcephaly, the condition that leaves babies with the misshapen heads and profound neurological damage that stoked global anxiety. Zika has been taking a path similar to other viral infections that offer immunity to those who have fallen ill and recovered. In Brazil, Colombia, Puerto Rico and other places hard hit by the epidemic, so-called herd immunity may limit the potential for new outbreaks because the virus cannot gain enough traction to spread among those who have never been infected. But over time, the benefits of herd immunity wane as more children are born, providing fresh tinder for the next epidemiological wildfire. Researchers are also unsure whether those infected with Zika are immune for life, or just for a period of time. Public health officials have been frustrated by haphazard cooperation from countries worried about the stigma associated with Zika as well as those overwhelmed by other health crises. In Angola, the government did not initially report dozens of microcephaly cases that were first discovered by Portuguese researchers. Earlier this year, India protested its inclusion on the C.D.C.'s advisory list for pregnant women during a Zika outbreak in the country's northwest. In April, the C.D.C. modified its warning. Dr. Eve Lackritz, who leads W.H.O.'s Zika Task Force, said one of her main tasks is to keep up the sense of urgency. ""My biggest fear is complacency and lack of interest by the global community,"" she said.

In its new report, the W.H.O. conceded that there was no way to know with certainty whether Zika was still circulating in the 87 countries with previously recorded cases of transmission. Its advice for pregnant women seeking to travel reflects that ambiguity: cover up exposed skin with light colored clothing, use insect repellent and ""carefully consider the risks."" (It also advises men returning from areas with known Zika outbreaks to consider abstaining from sex for at least three months.) [The topics new parents are talking about. Evidence-based guidance. Personal stories that matter. Sign up for the NYT Parenting newsletter for the info you need about pregnancy and more.] Dr. Peterson of the C.D.C. and others who study Zika and closely related viruses, including dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya, say they are worried the world is unprepared for the next outbreak. For one, the underlying conditions that enabled the epidemic -- crowded urban neighborhoods whose residents are too poor to afford insect repellent or window screens -- remain a problem in much of the developing world. Aedes has developed a particular fondness for human blood and has adapted so well to urban living that it can quickly breed in overturned bottle caps and other refuse after a rainfall.

""Our biggest fear is that we will never get rid of Zika, just like we can't get rid of dengue,"" said Paolo Zanotto, a molecular virologist at the University of Sao Paulo. Compounding that fear, he said, is the possibility that Zika virus could find a host in animals, especially monkeys, making it even harder to control. Early hopes for a vaccine against Zika have also stumbled. Although a number of potential vaccines are in the pipeline, the ebbing of the epidemic has made it hard to test their efficacy in the field.

Arboviruses like dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever provide something of a template for the future of Zika. During the 1940s and 50s, successful eradication campaigns aimed at quelling deadly yellow fever outbreaks vanquished Aedes from Brazil and much of the region. But by the 1970s, as those efforts were abandoned, the mosquito quickly re-established itself, leading to increasingly intense outbreaks of dengue and yellow fever, and more recently the emergence of new arboviral pathogens like chikungunya and Zika. These days, dengue infects over 100 million people globally a year, killing 10,000. Until 2015, Zika was an obscure and fairly harmless virus that produced flulike symptoms. First identified in 1947 among monkeys in the Zika forest of Uganda, it later found a foothold in humans and then spread across Africa, Southeast Asia and the South Pacific. The virus is believed to have most likely arrived in Brazil with a traveler attending the World Cup there in the summer of 2014. Scientists are still stumped as to why Zika began causing birth defects. ""We thought of Zika as an inconsequential disease, but then it exploded in Brazil with devastating consequences,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""The larger lesson for us is that we have to always be prepared for the emergence and re-emergence of viruses and microbes."" Zika has presented health officials with a number of challenges. Tracking its spread has been difficult because many countries, especially those with weak public health systems, lack the ability to identify new cases. Compounding the problem is that the vast majority of people infected experience symptoms so mild they rarely seek medical care. And because Zika, dengue and chikungunya all produce fever, joint pain and rashes, Zika cases are often misdiagnosed. One of the biggest obstacles to better surveillance -- and to informing pregnant women that they've been infected -- is the lack of a rapid, inexpensive diagnostic test. ""At this point we can only guess the number of new infections,"" said Dr. Scott C. Weaver, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston who was among the first to predict Zika's arrival in the Americas. As public health experts across the world continue their prevention work, thousands of families here in Brazil are already struggling with Zika's impact. The first Zika babies are turning 3 and 4, and their families, many of them poor, are increasingly overwhelmed, said Dr. Marques, the researcher from Rio de Janeiro. ""It's a nightmare for these mothers,"" he said. ""And as the children grow older, it's not going to get any easier.""","The mosquito-transmitted virus, which can cause severe birth defects, faded after 2016, but it's still circulating and has now spread to other countries.",18e77596-63dc-5332-846e-bc60f3db6bb1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/02/science/02ZIKA1/02ZIKA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=c481634762c84839f5ad51806f26c119a169dff76460785d3a52ad591274b2b8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A Venezuelan health worker fumigating to help control mosquitoes in Caracas in 2016, at the height of the Zika epidemic.",18e77596-63dc-5332-846e-bc60f3db6bb1,N24News/imgs/18e77596-63dc-5332-846e-bc60f3db6bb1.jpg,1
