Music,2020 Is Chaotic. Clipping's New Horror-Rap Album Captures It.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/19/arts/music/clipping-daveed-diggs-chapter-319.html,"Jonathan Snipes, Daveed Diggs and William Hutson of Clipping, an art-rap trio that weaves themes of racial injustice through its members' obsessions.





LOS ANGELES -- On a sunny October afternoon, the producer Jonathan Snipes heard the distant bloop of a postal scanner and bounded to grab the day's mail: a box of eight blank cassettes for his Tascam Portastudio along with the comically complicated score to ""The People United Will Never Be Defeated!,"" from the American composer Frederic Rzewski. The adventurous contemporary-classical ensemble Alarm Will Sound had asked his noise-flecked rap group, Clipping, to submit an interpretation of the politically charged 1975 piano piece. ""If you really know a lot about, like, 20th-century piano technique, this is apparently just, like, nonstop inside jokes about Schoenberg,"" Snipes said, barefoot in a shady pocket outside his apartment's shared patio space. ""Oh really?"" said the producer and Clipping member William Hutson from about 12 feet away, his neck draped in a paisley bandanna. ""It's a gorgeous score, too, man,"" Snipes added. ""I can read some of it. I can't play any of it."" They both laughed.

A challenging, political assignment should be no match for Clipping. The group's sui generis art-rap weaves themes of racial injustice through its members' obsessions: contemporary-classical music, harsh-noise cassettes, horror movies, musique concrete, sci-fi novels, field recordings and the regional 1990s hip-hop scenes that thrived outside of New York and Los Angeles. Its lineup is rounded out by a Tony- and Grammy-award winning heartthrob, Daveed Diggs, famous for originating the roles of Marquis de Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson in the original Broadway run of ""Hamilton"" and for co-writing ""Blindspotting,"" the acclaimed 2018 film about gentrification. While the group has released three albums on the storied rock label Sub Pop since 2014, its music has become strikingly timely. If Run the Jewels are the polemicist poets facing America's racial reckoning with six-foot-high spray-painted lettering, Clipping's members are the academics connecting the horrors of the country's past with thumbtacks and string.

At first, Diggs was hesitant to record a track reacting to the spate of police killings of Black Americans this year. ""My DMs were sort of full of people asking me to say something, and I was deeply frustrated with that, because everything I could have said, I already made a movie about, I've been saying very openly for the last 10 to 15 years,"" Diggs said, video chatting from a nondescript rental in Vancouver, where he is filming the second season of the TV series ""Snowpiercer."" Hutson was struck by hearing pointed, political songs by the rapper YG at protests in Los Angeles, and suggested a track that felt ""like marching orders for like a march across a freeway."" Recorded separately in quarantine, ""Chapter 319"" poignantly samples Floyd himself, who made a few appearances in mid-90s Houston as Big Floyd, a rapper in the orbit of the mixtape pioneer DJ Screw. It's one of the rare songs in the Clipping catalog where Diggs uses the first person. ""I felt much lighter after we put that out,"" Diggs said. ""And then the fact that it proved to be useful for people was really also very heartening."" Clipping released its first mixtape eight years ago, but Diggs and Hutson go back much further than that. The two have been close since their days at Marin Elementary School in the Bay Area, bonding over Parliament-Funkadelic. Hutson had the most permissive parents in their friend group and held weekend-long hangouts where the young friends listened to abstract rap groups like Souls of Mischief and Freestyle Fellowship, and watched R-rated horror movies and John Waters films. Diggs went to Brown University on a track scholarship, and Hutson and Snipes met during their freshman year at U.C.L.A. -- all three would graduate with various theater degrees, foreshadowing Clipping's distinct sound design and deep plotlines. After graduation, Diggs returned to the Bay Area, where he released motor-mouthed rap mixtapes with his creative partner Rafael Casal and began writing the screenplay for ""Blindspotting."" He would visit Snipes and Hutson in Los Angeles, where they were remixing songs by Ludacris and Drake with the sounds of ""power electronics,"" a genre born in the early '80s in Britain in which a performer culls formless sheets of feedback. Intrigued, Diggs agreed to provide vocals.

After releasing its debut, the group toured relentlessly, but Diggs was also taking frequent trips to New York to workshop the project that would become ""Hamilton."" Diggs's work outside Clipping has made him a master of multitasking, but it's also pushed him to his limits. While starring in Suzan-Lori Parks's play ""White Noise"" during its 2019 run at the Public Theater, he recorded Clipping music at a nearby studio until call time and then performed in the physically taxing play. At one point, he fainted rehearsing a scene in which he attempted to bowl a perfect game. (""I'd never fainted before,"" Diggs said, ""and it freaked me out."") The two Clipping albums those sessions yielded -- ""There Existed an Addiction to Blood"" from 2019 and ""Visions of Bodies Being Burned"" -- sew the group's socially conscious threads through the gory narratives of '90s ""horrorcore"" rap artists like Brotha Lynch Hung and Ganksta N-I-P. Horrorcore is already somewhat political -- a genre that uses exaggeration to confront grim inner-city realities and spit blood in the face of white American morality. Clipping combines this classic formula with a love of industrial noise and its natural affinity toward sociopolitical commentary. Inspired by Octavia E. Butler's 2005 novel ""Fledgling,"" the 1973 art-horror film ""Ganja & Hess"" and the ""Blade"" comic books, ""Blood on the Fang"" is a vampire tale where Black revolutionaries like Bobby Hutton and George Jackson return as day-walkers fighting the police. ""Everybody wanna kill a movement 'fore the moment,"" Diggs raps, ""but they cannot kill what cannot die."" In true Clipping fashion, its horrorcore albums feature no shortage of adventurous recording experiments. The track ""Run for Your Life"" is made of multiple beats recorded from a moving van -- Diggs's raps change tempo to account for the Doppler effect. Snipes spent a week getting up before dawn and capturing field recordings from the site of the grisly Black Dahlia murder -- they ended up in a cover of Yoko Ono's 1953 composition ""Secret Piece."" ""They make it seem so easy, like 7/8 hip-hop,"" Michael Clayville, the trombonist and director of marketing for Alarm Will Sound, said about the odd meter that Clipping has used. ""Not an intuitive thing, and it just comes across as being natural.""","The trio featuring Daveed Diggs, William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes returns with another blast of political music that crosses genres and boundaries.",e3ac4521-411d-5dab-9b9a-f2a0758d2f92,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/19/arts/19clipping2/19clipping2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=dc4b1c0af26d4a7143e20d3f5a1e44e8bce49bf317209b1e24340024c21665b9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""A rap song hits when there's a part of it that you want to say,"" Diggs said of the success of ""Chapter 319.""",e3ac4521-411d-5dab-9b9a-f2a0758d2f92,N24News/imgs/e3ac4521-411d-5dab-9b9a-f2a0758d2f92.jpg,12
Food,"Eggplant Favorites, Rooted in Sicily",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/dining/eggplant-recipes.html,"Ingredients for pasta alla Norma, a dish that was a favorite of Vincenzo Bellini, the composer of the opera ""Norma."" Karsten Moran for The New York Times

It is always fascinating to see how cuisines and cultures collide. Sicily has been fought over and ruled by many peoples over the last 2,500 years, starting with the ancient Greeks. Each conquering group introduced ingredients from its home turf, adding layers to an ever-evolving local cuisine: The Greeks planted grapes and olives, the Romans contributed wheat.

But it wasn't until the early Middle Ages, under Byzantine and Muslim rule, that eggplant became part of the everyday Sicilian diet. Eggplant, originally cultivated in South Asia, had long been a staple of Arabic cookery; now it is popular throughout most of the Mediterranean. The Spanish introduced tomatoes and peppers from the New World, two other ingredients that now lie at the heart of Sicilian cooking.

Sicilian cuisine today is varied, with beloved regional recipes and all manner of extravagant food for feast days, as well as incredible fish and shellfish from the coastline. But a recurring theme in daily cooking is the use of a few inexpensive, common ingredients: olive oil, eggplant, tomato and pasta, usually with a pinch of peperoncino, crushed hot red pepper. These are down-home, primal flavors, emblematic of so-called cucina povera, in which simple and delicious meals are made on the cheap. Eggplant often stands in for meat. Slices dipped in bread crumbs and pan-fried in olive oil replace lamb chops, or are rolled with cheese to make involtini. Eggplant salads, eggplant pickles, eggplant-heavy pasta dishes, stewed eggplant, stuffed eggplant, grilled eggplant -- you find all these and more in Sicily.

Pasta alla Norma is humble, traditional and justly famous. The 19th-century composer Vincenzo Bellini is said to have adored it with such a passion (he ate it for lunch daily in his hometown, Catania) that the dish was eventually named after his opera ""Norma."" You make a simple basil-infused tomato sauce, fry eggplant cubes in olive oil, toss both with pasta and shower with grated ricotta salata and toasted bread crumbs. Or do you? Some cooks forgo the crumbs. Some fry large slices of eggplant and lay them over the pasta, or ring the platter with them instead.

Eggplant caponata is of Arabic origin, presumably, since it is stewed in oil, sweetened with sugar and spiked with vinegar. A kind of savory preserve, it is often made in quantity and stored in jars for use throughout the year. This one has capers and green olives, but other versions contain raisins and pine nuts; I know a cook who includes a pinch of saffron. Some cooks add a lot of tomatoes, but I prefer just a touch of tomato paste. The seasoning is sweet, sour and salty, like a good pickle. Wait to taste it a day or two after it is prepared, so the flavors can fully meld. Serve caponata on little toasts as an appetizer or to accompany a meal -- or as a picnic lunch with a loaf of crusty bread. Eggplant parmigiana is often blanketed in tomato sauce, which makes this tomato-free version, which I learned from a Sicilian cook in a small town outside Palermo, rather unusual. She makes it by layering thinly sliced eggplant with tuma (a fresh curd cheese), caciocavallo, pecorino and Parmesan; I use fresh ricotta and smoked mozzarella for a similar effect. It is a bit like a lasagna without pasta. A dozen anchovy fillets are scattered on top. Those anchovies, melted into the crisp bread-crumb-and-cheese topping, provide a sharp contrast to the sweetness of the eggplant. I like to serve it at room temperature, with a tomato salad alongside.","Pasta alla Norma, caponata and eggplant parmigiana: All hail from Sicily, where it's hard to imagine the cuisine without the humble eggplant.",679da1e5-f888-55e6-ac38-100e4c8b821c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/05/dining/05KITCHEN1/05KITCHEN1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=f558f24c30fbfa0a8067b532eaf38b6af5498c1f3262af67dae90814b80ceffe&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Pasta alla Norma is a humble dish, yet justly famous.

Fashion & Style,The British Fashion Council Names a New Chairman,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/fashion/british-fashion-council-stephanie-phair.html,"""I am honored and delighted to take on the role of chairman,"" Ms. Phair said. ""The British Fashion Council is in a strong position following the incredible work of Dame Natalie Massenet, Caroline Rush and the team, and my role will be to build on this and help drive continued innovation and new thinking in this fast paced, changing industry .""

Ms. Phair began her 13-year e-commerce career at Portero Luxury, the first pre-owned luxury marketplace. She then joined Net-a-Porter as president of the Outnet, which she introduced in 2009; she also sat on the board of the Net-a-Porter Group from 2009 to 2015, before moving to Farfetch. Ms. Massenet, her former boss at Net-a-Porter, joined the board of FarFetch last February, 18 months after she walked away from the company she created. She is likely to have had a firm hand in guiding the BFC toward a suitable successor.

The fact that Ms. Phair's reputation and experience stem largely from the digital world and C-suite would also indicate that the BFC is looking to continue on the course set by Ms. Massenet -- specifically, helping designers leverage the digital world to boost their international exposure and business growth, and cementing London as a fashion capital with events like the annual Fashion Awards.

Ms. Phair is also a member of the advisory board of Felix Capital, a venture capital company based in London, and sits on the board of the Italian luxury brand Moncler.

A statement from Ms. Rush, the fashion council's chief executive, said: ""On behalf of the Board of the British Fashion Council, I welcome the appointment of  as our incoming Chair and we all look forward to working with her on strengthening the opportunities for British fashion talent and businesses over the next few years.","The appointment of Stephanie Phair, a digital strategist, indicates that British fashion's governing body is continuing to focus on the future.",0ac5c804-c6e0-590e-ac01-b06e0522a1d7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/11/fashion/10bfcchair-A/10bfcchair-A-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=cf790fc463b2bb066f4c517879ee225df05456605c5886f06c8da8b5b66537b3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Stephanie Phair,0ac5c804-c6e0-590e-ac01-b06e0522a1d7,N24News/imgs/0ac5c804-c6e0-590e-ac01-b06e0522a1d7.jpg,19

Two years after Fox announced the cultural behemoth would come to a close after 15 seasons, here it is back again on ABC. Ryan Seacrest is still around despite a swirl of controversy, but the judges box looks decidedly different, with Katy Perry, Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan calling the shots. Ms. Perry will bring bursts of zaniness, while Mr. Richie will bring the sage perspective of an older generation. ""For two days a week, Professor Richie is going to talk about the reality of what it takes to be an artist,"" he said in an interview with The New York Times.

O.J. SIMPSON: THE LOST CONFESSION? 8 p.m. on Fox. In 2006, the editor and talk show host Judith Regan conducted an interview with O.J. Simpson in which he gave a hypothetical account of how he might have been involved in the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. But the interview -- and the accompanying book, ""If I Did It"" -- were pulled after an uproar. Now, Fox will run the interview, along with a panel segment with experts analyzing the footage. Ms. Regan will be on the panel, which will also include Christopher Darden, a prosecutor in the Simpson case. Soledad O'Brien hosts the two-hour special.

IHEARTRADIO MUSIC AWARDS 8 p.m. on TBS, TNT and TruTV. The iHeartRadio Music Awards are typically a breezy, bubbly and youthful affair, and this year should be no different, with the show anchored by performances from two of 2017's most explosive newcomers: Cardi B and Camila Cabello. Ed Sheeran, Eminem, N.E.R.D. and Kehlani will also perform, and Chance the Rapper will receive the Innovator Award. Taylor Swift, largely quiet since the release of her sixth album ""Reputation,"" will debut her music video for the slinky ""Delicate,"" from that album.

TIMELESS 10 p.m. on NBC. On Thursday, The Times published some obituaries for remarkable women as part of a series called ""Overlooked."" The second season of ""Timeless"" similarly sheds light on underappreciated women and people of color throughout history, using a time-travel premise to hop in and out of different eras. Abigail Spencer, Malcolm Barrett and Matt Lanter star as three people on a mission to stop a nefarious villain from changing the course of American history. In this episode, they find themselves alongside Marie Curie on the French battlefront during World War I, as she attempts to save as many lives as possible. NAKED AND AFRAID 10 p.m. on Discovery. There are plenty of batty premises in reality television, but perhaps none more so than ""Naked and Afraid,"" which is exactly what it sounds like: The show leaves two naked strangers in the wilderness to scavenge for food and survive for 21 days.

Automobiles,Amphibious Car Is Still Waiting to Catch a Wave,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/automobiles/amphibious-car-is-still-waiting-to-catch-a-wave.html,"IF all goes according to plan, the 2013 Quadski will be the first amphibious vehicle from the Gibbs companies to make it into the sales distribution chain.

Although it didn't meet United States environmental and safety standards, the Aquada did meet European requirements, according to Neil G. Jenkins, chairman of Gibbs.

The Aquada was, for the most part, well received. In Britain, the magazine Auto Express said it was ""more fun to drive than a lot of saloons,"" using the British term for sedans. Time Magazine named it to a list of the best inventions of 2003.

Opinion,Lord & Taylor Was More Than a Store,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/15/opinion/letters/lord-taylor-closing.html,"Re ""Goodbye to the Way We Used to Shop,"" by Sarah M. Seltzer (Sunday Review, Sept. 6):

One of the great ladies of retail is departing.

Five generations of my family have looked to Lord & Taylor as their mainstay, their ""go to"" store. My nana (receipts starting in 1905), mother and I shopped and lunched amid live parakeets and visited the real Santa there.

In the dressing room mirrors, I journeyed from young girl to old woman. I became the grandmother watching my daughters and granddaughters discover the delights of the store.

""Nanny, look at my shoes. The ones I got for prom.""

""Where did you get them?""

Somehow the answer didn't surprise me.

Yes, a lovely reminiscence about Lord & Taylor, an eternal place of comfort and familiarity. This was a go-to place for my mom in the 1940s. She would grab my hand and say, ""Come on, dear, we're heading uptown to shop at L.&T.""",Readers mourn the closing of the legendary department store.

Theater,Their Latest Risk: Household Objects Playing Shakespeare,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/theater/forced-entertainment-tim-etchells-table-top-shakespeare.html,"There are no small parts. There are some very small actors. In ""Complete Works: Table Top Shakespeare,"" which starts on Sept. 11 at N.Y.U. Skirball, the blazingly inventive English company Forced Entertainment will whiz through 36 Shakespeare plays. (Sorry, ""Henry VIII."") Each play is a solo show, abetted by armloads of household objects: cups, cans, kitchen twine, wood glue, gin. Juliet is a jar of marmalade. Hamlet is a bottle of vinegar. (Genius.) Six Exeter University drama students founded Forced Entertainment 34 years ago, and ""Complete Works"" is just one more appendage to its wriggly, wondrous, maddening body of work. To see a Forced Entertainment show is to ask what theater is. And why theater is. And how on earth am I still awake. A pioneer of durational performance, Forced Entertainment has created performances that last all night, all day and still never get where they're going. (Failure is an enduring, intended theme.) The curtain raiser for ""Complete Works"" is ""And on the Thousandth Night ... "" a storytelling marathon on Sept. 8 that starts at midnight and finishes at 6 a.m., without any of the stories ever reaching completion. (N.Y.U. Skirball will provide cocktails and beer. Also -- urgently -- coffee.) ""Both pieces take a simple idea and try to push it as far as we can go,"" said Tim Etchells, the company's artistic director. For this troupe, the only collective that has ever won the International Ibsen Award (other winners include Peter Brook and Ariane Mnouchkine), that is very, very far.

Speaking by telephone from Sheffield, England, Mr. Etchells, who appears in ""On the Thousandth Night ...,"" discussed inanimate objects, epic performances and why most Forced Entertainment shows -- the Skirball ones, too -- are built to fail. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Why Shakespeare? Why now? If you're based in the U.K., people are always saying, ""Would you ever do Shakespeare?"" For more than 30 years, our answer was, ""No, I don't think so."" What I like about this project is that we're sort of doing them all, and then, in another way, not quite. We really focus on the plot architecture. Mostly, it's very easygoing language, very everyday.

Are there any plays that don't work? Some of his later plays -- the plots are extremely rickety and chaotic. Something like ""Cymbeline,"" it's a bit of a mess. On the tabletop, that's quite fun. There's something about narrating it that allows it to breathe in a different way. Why stage the plays with household objects? I've always been interested in the way that, as an audience member, you're projecting, you're doing the work of the imagining. And here, because the actors on the tabletop are inanimate objects, they're perfect screens. You actually end up watching the last breath of Cordelia in ""King Lear"" and thinking: Oh, now she's died! That glass vial that was Cordelia for the 40 minutes -- there's no life in that thing any more. Theatrically, it works in quite a weird, magical, transformative kind of way, as well as being ridiculous.

Asking audiences to feel for a potato masher or marmalade seems like a generous challenge. Sometimes your work is less generous. What's your relationship to the audience? We're always trying to reinvent that relationship. We get bored of always railing at people or poking them. I think there is a challenge -- a huge challenge -- in this Shakespeare piece, but it's also built on this quite genial and quite open, quite everyday attempt to say, ""Let's be in this small space together and try to see if we can make this particular thing happen."" The possibility of it all falling to pieces seems really important in terms of what a live performance is. Both the Shakespeare and the long durational piece, they both have very clear ways in which they are always failing or might always fail. The vulnerability of that's interesting to me. It's human and it's got a kind of frailty to it. In ""And on the Thousandth Night ...,"" we're improvising stories, and a lot of the fun in that piece is just watching people get trapped, improvising things that they clearly have no possibility to successfully complete.

How did you develop ""And on the Thousandth Night ...""? We arrived slowly at the form of improvised story and the dynamic of interruption. Performers stop each other whenever they choose. It's a very playful piece. It can be quite delirious and unruly at times. There's a competitive, contradictory edge to it. Funny, but quite tough. Durational work breaks down some of the defenses that you have as a performer. The first hour is the hardest and the least interesting, because you're fully in control. In the later hours, your ability to stage-manage yourself gets weaker, your ability to hold it together starts to erode. You find a different energy. It's actually harder to stop than it is to carry on. The troupe has been going for 34 years. Do you still like one another? It's tough. Students come in to see us, thinking that it might be some sort of utopian, idyllic situation. It's not. It's a meeting of six very different people with very different takes on what we're doing.

Music,"A Memorial for Jessye Norman at the Met Opera, Where She Reigned",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/arts/music/jessye-norman-met-opera-memorial.html,"When major figures in opera die, the Metropolitan Opera sometimes pays tribute to them with memorials at the opera house. Among those honored there over the years have been the composer Giacomo Puccini and the singers Enrico Caruso, Luciano Pavarotti and Beverly Sills.

Now the majestic soprano Jessye Norman is joining their select ranks.

A memorial for Ms. Norman, who died Sept. 30 at 74, will be held at the Met on Nov. 24, the company said. It will feature performances, remarks and video highlights of her career. It will be free, and open to invited guests and members of the public.

""This has grown exponentially as we have been putting it together, which is fitting for a bigger-than-life-artist such as Jessye Norman,"" Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager, said.

The memorial will be held on the stage where Ms. Norman made her Met debut as Cassandre in Berlioz's ""Les Troyens"" in 1983 on opening night of the company's centennial season, and where she went on to sing more than 80 performances.","The soprano, who died in September, will be remembered on Nov. 24 with performances, remarks and video highlights of her storied career.",f88153aa-6b4b-55c1-9ce3-d70ec7481d29,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/06/arts/06norman-itemsub/06norman-itemsub-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=aa4c45926bf768db84da24d91e8344ecf8aa8c247d1b24e09d3370cb7228b582&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The soprano Jessye Norman in her Metropolitan Opera debut role of Cassandre in Berlioz's ""Les Troyens"" in 1983.",f88153aa-6b4b-55c1-9ce3-d70ec7481d29,N24News/imgs/f88153aa-6b4b-55c1-9ce3-d70ec7481d29.jpg,12
Opinion,We Can't Let Coronavirus Postpone Elections,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-election-primary-postpone.html,"Mr. Meacham is the author, most recently, of ""The Hope of Glory: Reflections on the Last Words of Jesus from the Cross.""

Darkness reigned. It was 1864, and the nation was split into two warring camps. Casualties rose steadily -- previously unimaginable numbers, ultimately reaching about 750,000 dead -- and fighting continued throughout the year. Gen. George McClellan, the Democratic nominee, posed a genuine threat to a second term for Abraham Lincoln. McClellan promised a quick, negotiated end to the war; a Lincoln defeat would have led to a permanently divided nation and the preservation of slavery in the Southern states. The fate of the war, the future of the Republic, the nature of the American experiment: Everything hung in the balance. And to preserve that experiment, Lincoln insisted that the presidential election go forward. The president was fully prepared to lose the election and, according to due constitutional form, to surrender power the following March. In August 1864, in a private note, he wrote, ""This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected."" But he would accept the verdict of the voters. Here was an incumbent president, the commander in chief of a nation facing a sustained armed rebellion, unilaterally subsuming his own ambitions and his own priorities to the very constitutional order then under siege. He was unwilling to sacrifice democracy to save it -- a lesson we need to bear in mind as the coronavirus pandemic threatens primaries in many states and could, in the Age of Trump, conceivably affect the general election in November.

Connecticut, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana and Ohio have postponed their state primaries because of concerns over the transmission of the coronavirus. Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island are scheduled for April 28 -- about the time the curve we are hoping to flatten may or may not be trending in the best of directions. It will be tempting for leaders in those states and others to postpone their primaries. Instead, in this hour of crisis, state officials -- understandably scrambling to secure their people -- should do all they can to hold their elections as soon as possible. The legitimacy of the eventual Democratic nominee could depend on it. History is on the side of proceeding in times of uncertainty. There's something in the American character that has long insisted on pressing ahead with democracy's fundamental task: the casting of ballots and the choosing of leaders. In addition to the Lincoln example, historians know that James Madison was re-elected amid the War of 1812; the midterm elections of 1814 took place not long after the British had invaded Washington; the 1918 balloting occurred despite the ravages of the Spanish flu; the 1932 election went forward in the face of the Great Depression; and Franklin Roosevelt was re-elected in 1944, during World War II. Even 9/11 delayed the New York City mayoral election only by a matter of weeks. We have world enough and time -- and, in several states, the experience -- to make the voting in November safe and secure. Colorado offers us perhaps the most promising model. A ""vote at home"" state (Hawaii, Oregon and Washington have forms of this, too), Colorado mails ballots to all registered voters well in advance of Election Day. Voters can either mail them back or drop them off at central locations at any point in the weeks-long window of time. Most people have chosen this option; think of it as curbside democracy. There are security issues, of course: ballots could be intercepted and illegally cast by people with access to a person's mail. There are, however, signature-checking safeguards in place. No system -- including the current one -- is perfect. But we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This coming Monday, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Ron Wyden are introducing legislation to make mail-in ballots available to every voter in America.

We need to have these kinds of conversations about the election honestly, rationally, and now. The sooner the better, for chaos could lead to a nightmare scenario: the possibility that President Trump might take advantage of the unfolding health crisis to delay the November election. Alarmist? Not for anyone who's paid even glancing attention to the president's will to power and contempt for constitutional convention. Though he's recently signaled that postponement isn't an issue, in the past he's also joked -- at least we think he was joking -- about blowing past the two-term limit imposed on presidents by the 22nd Amendment. He retweeted Jerry Falwell Jr.'s suggestion that Mr. Trump be given two additional years in office to make up for time lost to the Mueller inquiry. And he has long trafficked in conspiracy theories about unproven voter fraud in 2016. The good news is that the Constitution so ably defended by Lincoln gives the executive virtually no control over the timing of elections. Anxious about monarchal absolutism, the founders invested Congress, not the president, with the power to schedule the selection of presidential electors. In a 1934 decision, the Supreme Court held that Congress has every ""power essential to preserve the department and institutions of the general government from impairment or destruction, whether threatened by force or corruption."" By statute, Congress has set the date -- the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, every four years -- and the power to alter that date lies not with the branch established by Article II, the executive, but with the lawmakers whose authority is rooted in Article I. Scholars do not believe that even action by the president under national-emergency powers could postpone the quadrennial election unless Congress agreed -- which means the Democratic House may be the only bulwark against constitutional chaos come fall. These are early days in this crisis. We could do worse, though, than to look to Lincoln. When he wrote his letter about possible defeat in the summer of 1864, he said he would stay at his post until the last hour, true to his oath, making the best of things with President-elect McClellan to ""save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterwards."" In the gloom of disunion, a bit of light. May we find our way forward as Lincoln -- and all of us -- did in other days of darkness.

Theater,"West End Shows Announce a Return, Even as U.K. Coronavirus Cases Rise",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/theater/six-west-end-return-coronavirus.html,"Wax said he hoped that if the British government did order the show's closure, it would be for only two or three weeks. He is unable to get cancellation insurance, he added. The musical's return will benefit not just the actors and musicians, but also workers in the wider theater ecosystem such as wig makers, set builders and even accountants, Wax said. ""This is very much about jobs,"" he added. ""I'd need to start laying off staff in October if I don't get shows back on."" Wax said he would make a ""reasonable weekly profit"" if the run sold out. But he said he was keenly aware of the risks of trying to restart the show during a pandemic. In June, he said that ""Six"" would return for a series of drive-in events across Britain, but two weeks later the tour was canceled because of uncertainties around local lockdowns. Because the musical involves only six actors onstage, there will be few changes because of the virus. The choreography for one song will be rejigged so that the wives are not singing directly at one another, Wax said. Offstage, he said, numerous measures will be put in place to ensure staff safety. Cast members will probably be tested weekly during the run, although that will depend on government guidance and the availability of tests. The cast will not be barred from wider social interaction for the whole run -- as had been planned for the drive-in tour -- because of its length, Wax said, adding that isolating the cast would be ""prohibitively expensive.""

Audience-wise, the theater will operate at a reduced capacity of about 550, down from 967, to maintain social distancing and keep people at least three feet apart. All attendees will have to wear masks, as required by the British government. The production is one of several small-scale shows hoping to spark a revival of London's theater district this fall. ""The Mousetrap,"" which claims to be the world's longest-running play, said in July that it would return to the St. Martin's Theater on Oct. 23. And the British comedian Adam Kay said on Sunday that he would perform a six-week run of ""This is Going to Hurt,"" a show about his time as a doctor in Britain's National Health Service, at the Apollo Theater starting Oct. 22. Wax said he also intended to bring back two other West End shows -- ""The Play That Goes Wrong"" and ""Magic Goes Wrong"" -- in November and December. All of Wax's shows, as well as Kay's, will be at venues run by Nimax, a major theater group. It said on Sunday that it would reopen all six of its West End venues this fall. Britain's culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, wrote in The Mail on Sunday early this month that his staff was working on a project to alow full theaters to return by Christmas, based on measures such as rapid coronavirus testing of audience members. The project was called Operation Sleeping Beauty, he added. The ""Six"" announcement, and the other planned West End reopenings, are in stark contrast to the situation on Broadway, which is to remain closed for at least the rest of this year. Wax said he had his fingers crossed that ""Six"" would reopen successfully and not suffer the same fate as his planned tour of drive-in venues. ""It'd be really heartbreaking to get so close again and then have the whole thing called off,"" he said, adding: ""But I'd rather get on with things than wait this out.""","""Six,"" the hit musical, will start an 11-week run in November, with other shows including ""The Mousetrap"" also slated to resume soon.",01d508a6-dd90-50e0-bef5-461d19c6188e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/15/arts/14SIX-ITEM01/14SIX-ITEM01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=3a6b9fa8f41015f5b9d3d7dc4fffded648763cdcff3ae29246f481901fabafd1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Because &ldquo;Six&rdquo; involves only six people onstage, the show will need few changes because of the coronavirus.",01d508a6-dd90-50e0-bef5-461d19c6188e,N24News/imgs/01d508a6-dd90-50e0-bef5-461d19c6188e.jpg,10
Media,"In Watergate, One Set of Facts. In Trump Era, Take Your Pick.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/11/business/media/comey-trump-watergate.html,"In Watergate, One Set of Facts. In Trump Era, Take Your Pick.

It's a question that has hung out there throughout our hyper-driven, hyper-divided media era: What would Watergate look like if it were to happen now? We no longer have to wonder. Forget Deep Throat, the anonymous senior F.B.I. official whom history so fondly remembers for guiding Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward through the corruption scandal and cover-up that began with a break-in at the Democratic National Committee and ended with President Richard M. Nixon's resignation. We now have ""the deep state,"" the scheming coterie in the intelligence community supposedly seeking to take down the president to protect its own power, as the viral Web conspiracy goes. Once again, a senior F.B.I. official -- James B. Comey, fired by President Trump -- has played a central role in the drama by becoming a primary source for reporters covering an unfolding political scandal that is transfixing the nation and consuming a White House. (Deep Throat was the deputy F.B.I. director, W. Mark Felt.)

But whether Mr. Comey is bravely blowing the whistle on wrongdoing at the highest levels of government, a la Mr. Felt, or showboating on a nonstory is under intense debate in certain robust media quarters. So, too, is whether the latter-day Woodwards and Bernsteins covering the latest break-in at the Democratic National Committee -- this time, a suspected cyberattack by the Russians -- are worthy of Pulitzer Prizes or professional-wrestling-style body slams. Of course, Watergate unfolded in a much simpler time in the media industry. There were three major news networks and PBS; a major paper or three in every city; and a political dynamic in which leaders duked it out by day and dined together at night. They did so on a solid foundation of agreed-upon facts and a sense of right and wrong that was shared if not always followed. The Trump-Russia scandal is breaking during a time of informational chaos, when rival versions of reality are fighting for narrative supremacy. The causes are legion: The advent of right-wing talk radio and Fox News; the influence of social sites like Facebook, Twitter, Reddit; and the mainstreaming of conspiracy sites like InfoWars, which had almost five million visitors in the last month. By allowing partisans to live in their separate informational and misinformational bubbles, and, in some cases, to allow real news to be rendered as false -- and false news to be rendered as true -- they have all contributed to the calcification of the national divide.

Mainstream journalism, a shiny and ascendant conveyor of truth during Watergate, is in a battered state after decades of economic erosion, its own mistakes and the efforts of partisan wrecking crews to discredit its work, the most recent one led by the president himself. All of it gives the Trump White House something Nixon never had: a loyal media armada ready to attack inconvenient truths and the credibility of potentially damning witnesses and news reports while trumpeting the presidential counternarrative, at times with counterfactual versions of events. Review papers from the Nixon White House and you can see just how much Nixon and his team pined for a media environment resembling the one today. ""Nixon was always complaining that he had no defenders,"" John Dean, the former Nixon White House counsel, and current CNN contributor, told me Friday.
* Retail earnings and Black Friday: the week in business.
* Elizabeth Holmes will resume her testimony in her fraud trial. As a memo from one adviser read in 1970: ""The lens through which our message gets through is a distorted lens,"" therefore ""we ought to give consideration to ways and means if necessary to acquire either a government or other network through which we can tell our story."" When a separate memo presented a more detailed plan for a pro-administration news service, White House records show, another adviser, Roger E. Ailes, raised his hand to start it. The plan fizzled, but Mr. Ailes, who died last month, would start the Fox News Channel some 25 years later. With no counterinformational media cocoons on Nixon's side, his die-hard partisans had to watch as The Washington Post, followed by The New York Times and, eventually, television and the rest of the news media, pounded away at all the Watergate developments. ""It does affect public opinion, which affects Congress, which affects impeachment proceedings,"" Mr. Dean told me.

Mr. Dean became a star witness for Senate investigators in June 1973, describing in his nationally televised testimony how Nixon was complicit in the Watergate cover-up. But the White House did not present any sort of visibly aggressive defense until Mr. Nixon's onetime counsel, Charles W. Colson, got on the ""CBS Evening News"" at the end of Mr. Dean's second day of testimony, arguing that Mr. Dean was a liar out to cover his own hide. That kind of delayed response would be unthinkable today. The pro-Trump pushback on Mr. Comey's testimony was immediate, with the president's son, Donald Trump Jr., live-tweeting attacks on Mr. Comey while Mr. Comey testified; his father following up the next morning and through the weekend; and various Twitter followers piling on. While Mr. Colson had to go on the news program of Walter Cronkite, the ""most trusted man in America,"" Mr. Trump's son could make his case before Team Fox, populated as it is with friendlies like Sean Hannity and Jeanine Pirro -- whose interview with Donald Trump Jr. on Saturday coincided with her attendance at the baby shower for Mr. Trump's sister-in-law, Lara Trump. The most vital and trusted news source for a large percentage of ""consistent conservatives,"" according to Pew, Fox focused as much on Mr. Comey's potential motives and actions as it did on the substance of his central charge: that the president of the United States sought to derail an F.B.I. investigation into ties between Russia and his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, as Russia allegedly sought to influence an election. Mr. Comey's historic testimony exploded onto the front pages of The New York Times and The Washington Post, and drove ample discussion across the major news networks as well as on CNN, MSNBC and Fox News's straight-news programs like ""Shepard Smith Reporting"" and ""Special Report."" But where the ""darkening cloud"" metaphors piled up in those provinces, there were clearing skies Friday night on Fox, as the host Tucker Carlson assured his audience: ""This whole story is a hoax."" Then again, Rush Limbaugh and various other Trump-friendly media outlets and online freelancers had been saying the same for weeks, sometimes fed by whole-cloth tales bouncing around the Web. One of them, outlined by my Times colleague Jeremy W. Peters on Sunday, falsely asserted that Mr. Comey had previously claimed that Mr. Trump had not sought to impede the investigation. When I asked Mr. Woodward earlier this year if the Watergate charges would have forced a presidential resignation in this environment, he said he believed they would have. The strength of the evidence, including the Oval Office tapes of Nixon engaged in the plotting, was too overwhelming to be denied in any environment, he said.","Rival versions of the Trump-Russia scandal are fighting for narrative supremacy, leaving news veterans wondering, ""What if Watergate happened now?""",1d73305a-5185-5807-b61e-9538fbc3f6dd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/12/business/12RUTENBERG-combo/12RUTENBERG-combo-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=975a16e1df78fdd3e65ee16323270100d1f6db3e7b7c0af391d163b32c4911dd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"John Dean, left, testified before the Senate in 1973, as did James Comey in 2017.

Music,"A Pop-Up Shop That Offers Bach Preludes, Fugues and Condoms",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/arts/music/pop-up-bach-store.html,"A neon sign at a former bank branch on 56th Street and Broadway in Manhattan beckons passers-by to the ""Bach Store,"" where the pianist Evan Shinners is playing five hours of Bach every day for more than a month.

It looks like a typical pop-up shop: the spare but cool neon signs, the bare whitewashed walls, the table up front for sales. But the offerings at this temporary storefront in the heart of Manhattan are musical: the music of J.S. Bach. Inside the shop, a Juilliard-trained pianist, Evan Shinners, is playing five hours of Bach each and every day -- for more than 30 straight days, even on Thanksgiving -- and presenting evening concerts with guests. He calls it the Bach Store.

The sight of Mr. Shinners at a Yamaha grand piano behind the plate-glass windows of a former bank branch on 56th Street and Broadway, within view of the stage door of Carnegie Hall, is drawing a stream of listeners for short doses of Bach. Marica Coniglio, 33, a tourist from Sicily, stopped in after visiting the Museum of Modern Art (""It was very peaceful and unusual,"" she said). David Niles, 57, a New Yorker, was picking up a Citi Bike nearby when he ducked in. (""It was an unexpected surprise,"" he said.)

The Bach Store is both an effort to make live Bach more accessible and available and something of an inward journey for Mr. Shinners, who is 32. It is also a marathon. ""My arms are falling apart,"" he confessed on the 20th day as he took a break from playing preludes and fugues from ""The Well-Tempered Clavier"" to a small crowd ranging in age from toddlers to older adults who had paid the suggested $10 admission charge. He practices in the shop daily from noon to 5:30 p.m., and evening concerts are at 6:15.

There is merchandise, too: The shop sells T-shirts emblazoned with the name of Mr. Shinners' alter ego, W.T.F. Bach; Bach cigarette lighters; stress balls shaped like brains that say ""Yours  Bach's,"" and condoms that note on their wrappers that Bach had fathered 20 children. Mr. Shinners said the marathon was partly inspired by an experience he had seeking the tutelage of the French harpsichordist and great Bach interpreter Pierre Hantai, who rebuffed him with a deep, two-page letter that he wound up taking very much to heart. ""He had Googled me and dismissed me as of the generation that tries to make high art accessible through YouTube gimmicks and things like that -- and I was certainly guilty of that,"" said Mr. Shinners, who has made videos playing Bach on two different pianos at once, and who, as W.T.F. Bach, performs electronic arrangements of Bach. In declining to meet him, Mr. Shinners said, Mr. Hantai wrote that his concern was not a matter of style, but of spiritual elevation. ""I took it upon myself to face this quote for five hours a day and to try to elevate myself spiritually,"" he said. ""And to put myself in a public setting where I could expose myself in a way that I was probably previously afraid to expose myself.""

The project was supported by a $20,000 grant from Music Academy of the West -- which Mr. Shinners attended in 2009 -- as one of its inaugural Alumni Enterprise Awards, given to music projects with community impact. Scott Reed, the academy's president, said in an interview that Mr. Shinner's project was ""the ultimate accessibility of great music."" As the end approached, Mr. Shinners, who had initially envisioned playing only during the month of November, decided to extend the run into the first week of December. And he is already thinking about a reprise. ""So many people come in here and leave so exalted, and that's moving,"" he said. ""So I think I will have to do it again.""",The pianist Evan Shinners is drawing pedestrians into an empty Manhattan storefront where he is playing five hours of Bach each day for more than month.,877044f7-76ab-54bd-aa2a-498a2dba2012,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/26/arts/26popupbach2/26popupbach2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=deb6b6e26e8f76a14eb24bb635dc68da8f8f9b73bdff07372a32ff9a2f5c5256&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A neon sign at a former bank branch on 56th Street and Broadway in Manhattan beckons passers-by to the &ldquo;Bach Store,&rdquo; where the pianist Evan Shinners is playing five hours of Bach every day for more than a month.",877044f7-76ab-54bd-aa2a-498a2dba2012,N24News/imgs/877044f7-76ab-54bd-aa2a-498a2dba2012.jpg,12
Media,"Katie Hopkins, Conservative Provocateur, to Leave Radio Show After Tweet",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/26/business/media/uk-katie-hopkins-lbc.html,"LONDON -- An outspoken commentator who gained fame after appearing on ""The Apprentice"" will be leaving her job at the radio station LBC after a post on social media about the recent attack in Manchester.

The commentator, , a conservative provocateur in the mold of Ann Coulter, is to step down after calling on Twitter for a ""final solution"" to the terrorism problem, which some had interpreted as a call for genocide, echoing the Nazi euphemism for the Holocaust.

Global Business,"Easy Credit Dries Up, Choking Growth in China",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/business/global/easy-credit-dries-up-crippling-chinese-cities.html,"SHENMU, China -- As the Chinese economy boomed, few cities soared faster or higher than Shenmu, a community of nearly 500,000 in northwestern China. Top luxury clothing stores in this city's downtown were recording as much as $500,000 a day in sales. Tables at the best restaurants had to be reserved weeks in advance. The new Fortune Garden Club for the city's business elite made headlines by paying $1 million for a king-size mahogany bed, to be used by members and their companions. But a painful credit crisis is now spreading across Shenmu and cities nearby, as thousands of businesses have closed, fleets of BMWs and Audis have been repossessed and street protests have erupted. Now the leading purveyors of Western fashions are deserted, monthly sales at restaurants are down as much as 97 percent and the marble entrance to the Fortune Garden Club is shuttered. All but one of the city's car dealerships have failed.

The owner of the city's largest jewelry store was detained by the authorities a week ago after creditors found him secretly packing millions of dollars' worth of gold and jewels into cases and accused him of preparing to flee the city without settling his debts. A top restaurant closed a day earlier, and its owner left town, as have the founder of the Fortune Garden and many other executives. ""It's an economic crisis just like the United States has had; just like it,"" said Wang Ting, an operator of an illegal casino in Fugu, near Shenmu. ""There's no cash, everyone stays home without a job, there's no way the economy can recover."" Shenmu, and nearby cities like Ordos and Fugu, are at the leading edge of broader troubles that are beginning to afflict the entire Chinese economy. Across China, growth has slowed. With the slowdown have come rising defaults on loans made outside the conventional banking system, chronic overcapacity in many industries like coal mining and steel production and, in particularly troubled cities like Shenmu, a sharp decline in previously debt-fueled prices for real estate and other assets.

The cracks are showing in many sizable cities like coastal Wenzhou, where informal lending, a big part of so-called shadow banking, has dominated for a quarter-century. Cities with economies linked to commodities with falling prices have also been affected, as more people have defaulted on loans. The biggest, most economically diverse metropolitan areas like Beijing and Shanghai seem considerably less affected, but also have many small and medium-size businesses that depend on informal lending.

Lending has collapsed here in northern Shaanxi Province, where it was particularly speculative and frenzied, and where the local coal industry has also been crippled by steeply falling prices. As some borrowers began defaulting early this year, worried lenders in the informal sector raised interest rates for small and medium-size businesses, previously 25 to 40 percent a year, to as much as 125 percent a year. The increase set off a much broader wave of defaults in recent weeks, as owners found themselves unable to repay billions of dollars in bad debts, many of them handwritten and hard to enforce in court.
* Open or closed on Thanksgiving? Here are stores' plans for Thursday and Friday. ""Almost no one will give you a loan,"" said a construction executive who gave only his surname, Xie, as he stood next to his white Toyota Land Cruiser outside a project that had been halted. Although changes are being slowly introduced, state-owned banks have long been allowed to lend only at low, regulated rates barely above the inflation rate, with the total value of loans controlled by quarterly quotas. All over China, these loans go overwhelmingly to large state-owned businesses, government officials and politically connected individuals, who then relend the money at much higher interest rates to small and medium-size businesses in the private sector that need money to grow. Liu Linfei, a government official from nearby Yulin, stood on a Shenmu street corner in a T-shirt and shorts on a recent weekend afternoon, outside two high-rise hotels where construction had been stopped just before the windows could be installed. He said he had borrowed 600,000 renminbi, almost $100,000, from a bank shortly before the collapse, at an interest rate of 4.1 percent a year. Mr. Liu then lent the cash to moneylenders here at an interest rate of 10.4 percent, planning to pocket the difference.

The moneylenders who borrowed from Mr. Liu defaulted, and now he is struggling to repay the bank. ""I'm not going to lose my house, because I'm repaying it little by little with money I borrow from my relatives,"" he said. Shenmu, a city of 500,000, is plagued by economic ills. The Chinese are finding it harder to repay loans because the economy is slowing. Most analyses of China's economy look only at the real economic growth rate, around 7.5 percent this year. But for companies' sales and profits, which determine their ability to repay debts, what really matters is the nominal growth rate, which is real economic growth plus inflation. Private sector businesses could afford to borrow at double-digit interest rates because nominal growth of 16 to 23 percent a year from 2004 through 2011 exceeded the rates. But nominal growth slowed last year to 9.8 percent and fell again in the first half of this year, to an annual pace of 8.8 percent. At the same time, overinvestment led to overcapacity. Dozens of new mines opened around Shenmu in the last decade and older mines expanded. But demand has grown much more slowly than expected for electricity and steel, the two main users of coal. Coal prices have dropped by half in the last three years as a result. Now, out of 90 mines near Shenmu, practically the only ones still operating are nine that are state-owned and do not need to show a profit. The popping of the real estate bubble has been the most serious blow to the local economy. Real estate prices had soared in cities across China. In Shenmu, 1,200-square-foot apartments that sold for less than $20,000 a decade ago reached $330,000 by last winter. Local real estate brokers say that they are advising sellers to avoid price cuts of more than 10 percent. But local business owners who buy and sell apartments say that deals are now being done for as little as $115,000 for a 1,200-square-foot apartment, a decline of 65 percent.","Growth has slowed, causing an increase in defaults on unconventional loans, chronic overcapacity in many industries and other problems.",714e4811-714d-5725-8ebc-1c7ae3755488,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/16/business/Chinaecon/Chinaecon-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=5b388f1978a30e2af52dfc003f5f2120fb92bdbbbb61b8f4e87d4f430ba6f1eb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"A farmer at a housing project in Shenmu, China, that has been stalled by financial problems.",714e4811-714d-5725-8ebc-1c7ae3755488,N24News/imgs/714e4811-714d-5725-8ebc-1c7ae3755488.jpg,24
Real Estate,Stuart Siegel,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/realestate/commercial/thirty-minute-interview-stuart-siegel.html,"Mr. Siegel, 59, is the president of the recently established New York City brokerage office of Engel & Volkers, a real estate company based in Hamburg, Germany, with around 600 offices in 38 countries. Before starting Engel & Volkers New York in May, Mr. Siegel was a founder and principal of Ore Hill Advisors, and he served as the president and chief executive of Sotheby's International Realty from 1991 to 2006. Q. How is business so far at the new office? A. Things are going very well. The progress we have made has really exceeded expectations. We've had very strong results recruiting and bringing in seasoned sales associates. Q. How many sales associates do you have now? Q. Most of them have come from other brokerages. A. All of them except for two. They have come to us, in many cases, without a lot of real estate experience but spectacular international sales experience. One of our folks worked for a family watch company in Geneva and was head of marketing there.

Q. There's a tremendous amount of competition in New York, particularly in the luxury market, Engel & Volkers's main focus. Is there enough business to go around? A. There really is enough business to go around. This is a start-up, but it's a start-up that's part of a company that has spent the last 35 years building its brand globally. The client base basically created the opportunity and the need for a New York Engel & Volkers business. We are a global, European brand coming to the U.S. Q. Are most of your clients foreigners looking to buy in New York? A. One side of the transaction is usually with a non-New York buyer or seller. Q. How many transactions have you done so far? A. You know, we're a private company, so we don't release transaction volume or sales figures.

But we have had a number of transactions. If you had said to me at the end of February, ""Where would you be in November?"" I would have never imagined. We're working on several large listings, but we have a spectacular offering at 10 Gracie Square. It's on 84th, between East End and the river. That's $3.5 million. Q. Are you taking mainly luxury listings? A. I'll take anything that represents quality, and that represents realistic pricing and a motivated seller. There could be an extraordinary $250,000 studio in Williamsburg. Luxury for me is not automatically determined by price. We might have a client who'll say, I want a $250,000 studio either for my kids or as an investment. And we have this happening right now. That person is simultaneously looking at a $5 million to $7 million flat. Q. Can we expect to see other New York offices? A. Most definitely -- in Manhattan and the tristate area. Will we be thousands of agents? Absolutely not. Will we be 25, 30 offices? No. But we could be 10 offices. We could be 12 offices. Q. So why did you leave Sotheby's? A. We sold the company to Cendant, and the successor company became Realogy. I stayed with Realogy for over two years, but I had several opportunities to go out on my own and start this advisory business. I advised primarily families, family offices, private and very closely controlled companies -- primarily for investments in hospitality and luxury destination resorts. I worked for the Ferragamo family, for example.

The advisory firm is still in existence. It's being run by my partners. Q. What made you decide to return to the residential brokerage business? A. If you had asked me seven years ago: Would I be back in a founding brokerage role? I would say never. But it's in our gene pool. The brand represents a lot of opportunity that's not yet recognized in the New York market. and I wanted to be part of that. The relationship with Christian Volkers goes way back. And when I decided to move back to the U.S., he approached me. We actually ran into each other quite serendipitously on Columbus Circle Thanksgiving weekend. My wife and I are walking along Columbus Circle -- we live on 60th Street -- and my wife leaned to me and said, ""You know, I think somebody is staring at us."" And I turn around, and lo and behold, it's Christian. I said, ""Christian, what are you doing here?"" He said, ""What are you doing here? I thought you were in Switzerland."" I said, ""Well, I think I'm going to come back and see what's happening in the New York market."" And I said to him, ""What are you doing here in New York?"" He said, ""I'm looking for a C.E. ...""

Health,"Social Security Runs Short of Money, and Ideas Fly on How to Repair It",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/health/social-security.html,"Social Security Runs Short of Money, and Ideas Fly on How to Repair It

We've long heard warnings that the Social Security program that 52 million Americans rely on for their retirement benefits could one day run out of money. Analysts say that's not going to happen -- if only because older people are such a powerful voting force -- but this year the system has hit a worrisome milestone: the Social Security Administration reported that the retirement benefits paid out each month exceeded the tax revenues and interest that fund the program. That necessitated the first dip into the Social Security Trust Fund in 35 years. By 2034, the agency estimated, it will have depleted those reserves, and its revenues will cover only about four-fifths of its promised benefits. ""There's a problem, but not a crisis,"" said Andrew Eschtruth, a researcher at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. ""It's something policymakers have acted on before, and the program has always paid full benefits.""

Making adjustments to keep Social Security solvent, crucial as that is, represents only one of the issues confronting Congress. It could also correct outdated aspects of a program that serves nearly 90 percent of Americans over 65. ""It's a good time to step back and try to make Social Security more effective,"" said Richard Johnson of the Urban Institute, author of a new report on raising the program's retirement age. The fixes will likely include changes designed to bring more money in and pay less out. Imposing a higher payroll tax or raising the level of earnings subject to Social Security taxes (as of January 1, they will apply to the first $132,900, already an increase) would bolster revenues. Money-saving measures could include reducing benefits for high earners and trimming the number of years that workers collect benefits by raising eligibility ages. Typically, such changes phase in for younger workers, not those already receiving Social Security or on the cusp of qualifying for benefits. The demographic imperatives underlying these options are evident. With baby boomers retiring, the system has more beneficiaries to support. Longer life expectancies -- about five additional years over the past several decades -- and improved health have meant that ""people can certainly work longer than they could in 1960,"" Dr. Johnson said.

Social Security now allows workers to claim benefits at age 62, though they'll receive bigger checks if they wait until their full retirement ages (66 to 67) or beyond. The average monthly payment this year: $1347.46. Working longer and claiming benefits later -- trends already well underway -- pay off in ways that extend beyond Social Security itself. ""It's good for people, it's good for government tax revenues and it could fuel economic growth,"" Dr. Johnson said. But as his report points out, living longer doesn't always mean people can work longer. Higher-income professionals may opt to stay on the job, he said, but ""health problems are increasingly concentrated among less educated workers and they're falling further and further behind"" economically. Moreover, even those who could work often discover that ""employers don't seem eager to hire 62 year olds."" By their early sixties, his analysis of national survey data found, a quarter of high school graduates and 37 percent of those without a high school diploma report work limitations related to their health. Many say their jobs require substantial physical effort.
* Locast, a nonprofit streaming service for local TV, is shutting down
* Capital One's chief executive was fined after being called a 'repeat offender.' The Urban Institute report suggests raising the early entitlement age to 65 and the full retirement age to 70, but building in safeguards for those who can't work, perhaps through Social Security's other programs. The agency could provide a safety net by fattening benefits for the very low-income. It could expand its Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, restructure the way its disability insurance works or provide partial benefits for workers who aren't totally disabled. While some think tanks and congressional staffs are exploring ways to strengthen Social Security financially, others are looking into outmoded provisions that penalize beneficiaries, primarily women.

Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, has introduced legislation intended to help widows, widowers and divorced spouses qualify for higher payments and receive benefits earlier if they're disabled. ""This bill would boost the incomes of Social Security recipients who are most likely to be living in poverty, the majority of whom are women,"" Mr. Casey, ranking member of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, said in a statement. Speaking of women and Social Security, another effort would award work credit for those who temporarily leave the labor force because of caregiving responsibilities. In the 1930s, when the Social Security Act was passed and then amended, policymakers assumed that women stayed home while men worked. Spousal and survivors benefits represented an attempt to provide for wives (and minor children) who had no work histories of their own. ""Major demographic changes over 80 years have led to fewer women qualifying for spousal benefits,"" said Mr. Eschtruth, co-author of a recent international survey of caregiver credits. The researchers found that 23 percent of Social Security dollars went to spousal and widows' benefits in 1960, compared to only 11 percent in 2016. That's partly because a growing proportion of women no longer marry, or have marriages that don't last 10 years, the threshold to qualify for divorced spouse benefits. It also reflects the fact that as women have poured into the work force, they may qualify for Social Security retirement benefits based on their own work histories. But because women earn less and are more likely to have spent uncompensated years as caregivers, their retirement benefits can still suffer.","As Social Security dips into its trust fund, policymakers propose changes to fix the program's finances and strengthen its benefits, especially for women.",039e80de-c1e6-5473-abf3-ec3d969ff2ae,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/27/science/27SPANSOCIALSECURTIY/27SPANSOCIALSECURTIY-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=43b2967ff0dcb01e923d1b5863bc6199f4ba94104a48a0039d3ac8ffa66a82b0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,,039e80de-c1e6-5473-abf3-ec3d969ff2ae,N24News/imgs/039e80de-c1e6-5473-abf3-ec3d969ff2ae.jpg,1
Health,Hopeful Start for First Uterus Transplant Surgery in U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/08/health/uterus-transplant-cleveland-clinic.html,"CLEVELAND -- Just minutes after the patient's name was placed on the waiting list for a transplant, details about a matching donor popped up. ""I was shocked,"" said Dr. Andreas G. Tzakis, the director of solid organ transplantation at the Cleveland Clinic's hospital in Weston, Fla. ""I really considered it an act of God."" Less than 24 hours later, on Feb. 24, the patient, a 26-year-old woman from Texas, became the first in the United States to receive a uterus transplant, in a nine-hour operation here at the Cleveland Clinic. Born without a uterus, she hopes the transplant will enable her to become pregnant and give birth. ""I have prayed that God would allow me the opportunity to experience pregnancy, and here we are at the beginning of that journey,"" she said on Monday at a news conference, where doctors revealed details of her operation. She gave only her first name, Lindsey, to protect her family's privacy. She and her husband, Blake, also 26, have three adopted sons.

The New York Times interviewed Lindsey in November as a candidate for an experimental uterus transplant, but it was not clear then whether she would be selected. At that time she did not want even her first name to be mentioned. Uterus transplant surgery, still experimental, is meant to help women who want to become pregnant but cannot because they were born without a uterus, suffered damage to it or had to have it removed. Between 3 percent and 5 percent of women of childbearing age worldwide are estimated to be infertile for these reasons, and about 50,000 women in the United States are thought to be potential transplant candidates.

Dr. Andreas G. Tzakis from the Cleveland Clinic confirmed that the first uterus transplant performed in the United States was a success and that the patient was doing very well. (SOUNDBITE) (English) DOCTOR ANDREAS TZAKIS FROM THE MEDICAL TEAM AT CLEVELAND CLINIC SAYING: ""The surgery on the donor and the recipient, used techniques that have been well established through transplantation of the other solid organs. They're a little bit more complex for this particular transplant because the uterus lies deep inside the pelvis and is difficult to access and the vessels are all deep inside the pelvis as well. So it's a little bit more difficult that way. Our first uterine transplant took place on February 24th lasted approximately nine hours and I'm pleased to report to you that our patient is doing very well."" (SOUNDBITE) (English) LINDSEY, FIRST UTERUS TRANSPLANT PATIENT IN U.S., SAYING: ""First and foremost I would like to take a moment to express the immense gratitude I feel towards my donor's family. They have provided me with the gifts that I will never be able to pay and I am beyond thankful for them. However the reason I chose to speak today is that I want to be open and honest and to share my story and that when I was 16 and was told I would never have children. And from that moment on I have prayed that God would allow me the opportunity to experience pregnancy and here we are today at the beginning of that journey. I am so thankful to this amazing team of doctors and all the nurses and staff who worked around the clock to ensure my safety and I feel like I found a new family in all of them. I am a mother already to three beautiful little boys that Blake and I have adopted through the foster care system. Because of that I would ask that you would all please respect our privacy and we will give updates as we can."" Dr. Andreas G. Tzakis from the Cleveland Clinic confirmed that the first uterus transplant performed in the United States was a success and that the patient was doing very well. Dustin Franz for The New York Times

The Cleveland Clinic's ethics panel has given the hospital permission to perform 10 uterine transplants in women ages 21 to 39, as an experiment. Officials will then decide whether to continue. Another patient is on the waiting list, and the clinic is still screening possible candidates. So far, 250 women have been evaluated. Two other medical centers in the United States -- Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston -- have announced similar pilot programs, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, which vets transplant programs and oversees the nationwide distribution of organs from deceased donors.

If the first transplants succeed, the procedure could come into widespread use, said Dr. David K. Klassen, chief medical officer of the organ sharing network. At the news briefing in Cleveland, Lindsey expressed ""immense gratitude"" to the family of the deceased donor. The uterus is an organ not usually removed for transplantation, and donor families must be asked for special consent. The donor, healthy and in her 30s, had several children, and had died suddenly, said Dr. Tzakis, who did not give the cause. Dr. Tzakis said the call about Lindsey's donor had come in the middle of the night, and he and a gynecologic surgeon, Dr. Tommaso Falcone, had immediately flown to another city to remove the uterus. As soon as they determined that the organ was healthy, they notified surgeons back in Cleveland to begin preparing Lindsey, who had flown there with her husband. The transplant surgery took nine hours, longer than the doctors had expected, even though they had practiced on animals and cadavers.

Medically, uterus transplants are a new frontier. Ethically, they reflect an increasing acceptance that transplants are justified not only to save lives, but also to improve the quality of life. That belief has already led to hand and face transplants for people with horrific injuries. Penis transplants may be next: Doctors at Johns Hopkins University plan to perform them for men wounded in combat. The transplant is not without risk: Patients face the usual surgical hazards of bleeding and infection, and the increased odds of infection and possibly even cancer, from the anti-rejection drugs, which suppress the immune system. But the drug risks will be relatively short-lived, as will the transplants themselves. After the woman has had one or two babies, the uterus will be removed so that she can stop taking anti-rejection drugs. A woman who wants two babies would probably keep the transplanted uterus for about five years, doctors said. The program in Cleveland has been about 10 years in the making. Dr. Tzakis, who led the team, spent time in Sweden to learn from doctors at the University of Gothenburg, who are the only ones in the world to have performed successful uterine transplants. They have operated on nine women so far -- taking the uterus from a living donor, often the recipient's mother -- and five have given birth. The babies have been premature but healthy, according to Dr. Mats Brannstrom, the leader of the program. The Cleveland team is using dead donors, to avoid putting live ones at risk, but Dr. Falcone said the team might consider living donors in the future. Lindsey found out that she had been born without a uterus after a series of medical tests were performed to find out why, at 16, she still had not had menstrual periods. The news was devastating: She had always hoped to have a large family. Even though she has three adopted children, she said she still craved the experience of pregnancy and childbirth.

If the procedure succeeds, the soonest Lindsey can give birth is about two years from now. She will have to wait a year before trying to become pregnant, to heal from the surgery and let doctors adjust the medications she will need to prevent her immune system from rejecting the transplant. To become pregnant, she will need in vitro fertilization. The surgeons did not connect fallopian tubes, so it is not possible for her to conceive naturally. Before the transplant, Lindsey had eggs removed surgically, fertilized with her husband's sperm, and frozen. The team required six to 10 embryos; otherwise, it would not have performed the transplant. In about a year, the embryos will be thawed and transferred into Lindsey's uterus, one at a time, until she gets pregnant. If she does, the baby would be delivered by cesarean section; the strain of labor and vaginal delivery may be too much for a transplanted uterus, the doctors said. The Swedish patients have all given birth by cesarean. When a uterus is transplanted, blood vessels are connected, but nerves are not. As a result, patients do not feel sensations from the uterus itself, like menstrual cramps or contractions, according to Dr. Brannstrom. But when pregnant, the women do feel the fetus move, probably through sensations from the abdominal wall, he said. Transplant patients and the families of deceased donors normally do not find out each other's identity unless both sides agree to allow it. Lindsey has not been told who the donor was, a clinic spokeswoman said. But if the donor's relatives see Lindsey speaking out, they will realize that she received her transplant from their loved one. They will know because the death occurred just before Lindsey's surgery date, and she is the only recipient so far. Lindsey said she realized that the donor's family members would know who she was, and it did not trouble her. She said she thought of them every day, knowing that her opportunity had come from their loss.","The details of what led to a nine-hour operation, and what lies ahead for the recipient, were disclosed on Monday.",faee0af6-3894-5c34-b113-7f3e631e9236,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/08/us/08UTERUSalt/08UTERUSalt-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=6230cf3e14e96fa0affe218d2b73cabdb9fa713cf2f5e7e1f8c973e941207505&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Lindsey McFarland, 26, of Texas, with her husband and doctors at a news conference after she underwent a uterus transplant at the Cleveland Clinic.",faee0af6-3894-5c34-b113-7f3e631e9236,N24News/imgs/faee0af6-3894-5c34-b113-7f3e631e9236.jpg,1
Books,Presidential Memoirs Don't Always Take This Long to Write,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/21/books/barack-obama-promised-land-presidential-memoirs.html,"The wait is over for the first volume of Barack Obama's presidential memoirs, ""A Promised Land,"" which came out on Tuesday. But as a slew of articles calling the book's arrival ""long-awaited"" and ""highly anticipated"" suggest, it was a considerable wait. Obama took three years and 10 months to publish -- longer than any other American president in the last century. The chart below shows the history. With the exception of presidents who died in office and George H.W. Bush, who never wrote a standard presidential memoir, no modern president has taken as long to publish after leaving the White House.

First, Obama's book is long. While he ""initially planned to write a 500-page memoir and be done in a year,"" The Times's Jennifer Szalai explained in a review, the book ended up stretching nearly 800 pages and taking more than three times longer to complete. And that's just volume one; a second remains in the works. Even so, other presidents have published similarly lengthy memoirs in less time. Bill Clinton's ""My Life"" appeared less than three and a half years after he left the White House and weighed in at around 1,000 pages. Harry Truman published the first installment of his two-volume memoirs a full year faster than Obama published his. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books?

""Obama is a genuine literary stylist,"" said Jonathan Alter, the author of two books about the 44th president. ""And anybody who has ever tried to be one knows that it can be like squeezing blood from a stone."" In an Atlantic interview, Obama confessed to laboring for hours over single paragraphs. ""As I understand it, he writes in a very classic way,"" said Peter Osnos, who in 1995 published ""Dreams From My Father,"" Obama's first memoir, at Times Books, then an imprint of Random House. ""He sits down with a pen and a pad.""

Obama also seems to have eschewed tactics embraced by other presidents who also wrote their own books. He has admitted to struggling to keep a consistent diary while in the White House, a useful aid for past presidential memoirists. Jimmy Carter drew heavily on his diaries to write ""Keeping Faith,"" which came out a brisk 21 months after he left office. ""His discipline allowed him to write it quickly,"" said Alter, the author of a new biography of Carter. ""Diaries help you speed the completion of your memoirs, and what slows them down is writing them yourself."" Clinton took a different tack, hiring a former foreign policy speechwriter, the historian Ted Widmer, to interview him at length about his early life. Widmer then had the interviews transcribed and sent to Clinton, where they became grist as the former president wrote. ""It's hard to look at a blank piece of paper and wonder what to say, especially if you're a former president trying to write for millions of readers,"" said Widmer, a professor at the Macaulay Honors College at the City University of New York. ""He understood intuitively that talking was a great way to begin."" Other presidents, such as Lyndon Johnson and Ronald Reagan, were able to publish their books faster with the help of aides and ghostwriters. Obama's publisher, Crown, said aides assisted him with research, but he wrote the memoir himself. Reagan's ""An American Life,"" which appeared less than two years after he left office, was largely ghostwritten; Reagan had little zeal for the project. ""He used to jokingly refer to it as the monkey on his back,"" said Mark Weinberg, a former aide. ""He didn't want it to dominate his post-presidency life."" Richard Nixon came the closest to surpassing Obama's timeline, though for different reasons. Holed up in his San Clemente, Calif., property with the handful of aides who helped draft his 1978 memoir, ""RN,"" Nixon had to contend with litigation stemming from the Watergate scandal.

""There were lawsuits that he had to defend against, and the Congress was still tracking him down,"" said Ken Khachigian, a former staffer who assisted with both Nixon's book and his legal defense. ""The experience, day to day, was not fun."" Presidential memoirs are ""a really hard genre,"" said Craig Fehrman, the author of a history of presidential books. ""We've seen lots of presidents with lots of talented aides, and ghostwriters too, take swings at this genre and struggle."" Despite selling well, the books often resist lively prose, genuine introspection and fluid storytelling, he said, and they can quickly derail amid policy wonkery, self-justification or score-settling. Fehrman believes that Obama's book could be an exception. ""You don't have to look far to find a literary writer who misses deadlines and goes on long bouts of self-contemplation,"" he said. ""On paper, he seems like the president who could break the streak.""","Barack Obama's new book, ""A Promised Land,"" arrived nearly four years after he left the White House. A look at how he and other presidents approached their memoirs offers some clues about the timing.",22a64b2c-ebea-5deb-9939-88c23c493af7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/20/books/OBAMABOOKTIME1/OBAMABOOKTIME1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=8c6dfc81f5063427e4c4d00c65a537abaae4f62221d7b3d634362940d965c4c0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Barack Obama's book, ""A Promised Land,"" for sale in Washington.",22a64b2c-ebea-5deb-9939-88c23c493af7,N24News/imgs/22a64b2c-ebea-5deb-9939-88c23c493af7.jpg,13
Real Estate,Shopping for Coasters,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/realestate/shopping-for-coasters.html,"No one wants be that anxious host who hovers over guests in the living room, trying to slip coasters under their drinks when they're not looking. Then again, no one wants to see their furniture ruined by ring marks.

The solution? Invest in interesting, well-designed coasters that you'll be happy to leave lying around and guests will enjoy using.

As Jacob Briars, the global advocacy director at Bacardi, pointed out, coasters aren't just functional: ""They also have an aesthetic role, which is to frame the drink. It's a chance for you to show off with a little flourish.""

Given that, you may want to own several styles.

""You might think about changing up the coasters depending on the sorts of drinks you're serving,"" said Mr. Briars, who is also an owner of a travel-themed bar called Clipper, in Auckland, New Zealand, where bartenders have been known to match cocktails to coasters depicting the countries in which the drinks were created.","Sure, they protect your furniture.

Media,"Graydon Carter, Ex-Editor of Vanity Fair, Invests in an App",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/14/business/media/graydon-carter-vanity-fair-app-zig.html,"Graydon Carter, the former editor of Vanity Fair, was preparing coq au vin in Provence, France, the other day when he picked up a telephone call from back home. ""We're just cooking,"" Mr. Carter said, affably, as the sounds of family chimed in the background. This is what semiretirement looks like for Mr. Carter, a bon vivant who is taking what he has called a six-month ""garden leave"" in France after 25 years as one of America's most influential magazine editors. He keeps up with the news in the London dailies, has found himself bombarded by Johnny Hallyday tributes in the French press and started reading Michael Wolff's book, ""Fire & Fury: Inside the Trump White House,"" before giving up halfway through. ""It was too depressing,"" Mr. Carter said. ""It's what I got away from."" He is not, however, staying idle. Mr. Carter, who has produced films and opened restaurants, said he was exploring a suite of new ventures -- the first of which is set to debut on Monday.

The idea, said Joshua James, one of the founders, is to deliver useful news without making readers slog through a dozen sites. ""I had been going to the same 15 websites for years, and they never knew what I wanted when I got there,"" he said. Mr. Carter offered advice -- when the founders considered changing their logo, Mr. Carter said he liked the old one, so it stayed -- but his most significant contribution was financial. He is one of several high-profile investors in Zig, along with the music producer Quincy Jones, the Hollywood mogul Ron Meyer and the concert giant Live Nation. Zig declined to disclose how much it had raised. Mr. James and a co-founder, Adam Platzner, pitched the idea to Mr. Carter at a tech-industry conference hosted by Vanity Fair in 2016. (The third founder is John Tornow.) At the time, Mr. Carter was mulling the state of news; he recalled an assistant pointing out to him that millennials ""think in more visual terms, than in textual terms.""

The photos that appear in a Zig feed double as links to the underlying articles, a referral system that the founders say could lead to revenue-sharing agreements with news sites. Users can also flip through dozens of photos inside the app, an ad-free way to quickly consume pop culture slide shows from sites like T.M.Z. and PopSugar. The app was originally designed for entertainment news, but Mr. Carter suggested that the founders broaden the scope. ""People follow Kellyanne Conway the way they follow Kim Kardashian,"" Mr. James said, recalling a lesson from Mr. Carter. Each user's feed is customized, with the mix of subjects (politics, pop culture) and celebrities (movie stars, members of the Trump administration) determined by his social media activity. Users can also share articles with friends, superimposing a photograph of themselves reacting to a story -- a thumbs-up for a Time's Up pin, for instance.","The music producer Quincy Jones and the mogul Ron Meyer join Mr. Carter, who is now on 'garden leave,' in investing in an Instagram-style app called Zig.",4c60fd1a-de08-5afd-8c08-66922fd52a08,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/13/business/15GRAYDONAPP-1/15GRAYDONAPP-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=480f3ef5fa9e96ab349c232a631dd30a12d9da8656ffefb3bef9d4134a5bce35&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Joshua James, left, and Adam Platzner created an app called Zig that has attracted investors including Graydon Carter, the music producer Quincy Jones and the Hollywood mogul Ron Meyer.",4c60fd1a-de08-5afd-8c08-66922fd52a08,N24News/imgs/4c60fd1a-de08-5afd-8c08-66922fd52a08.jpg,16
Dance,Review: Camille A. Brown's Rousing and Incisive 'ink',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/arts/dance/ink-review-camille-a-brown.html,"The choreographer Camille A. Brown often talks about the struggles she faced with body image as a young dancer, when teachers told her that she didn't have the ""ideal"" dancer's physique. I hope those people have been following her career, because she has been proving them wrong for about two decades, and continued to do so on Tuesday at the Joyce Theater with the New York premiere of ""ink.""

The conclusion of her trilogy on African-American identity, with ""Mr. TOL E. RAncE"" (2012) and ""BLACK GIRL: Linguistic Play"" (2015), ""ink"" flies by, a rousing and incisive final statement. While she has branched out into Broadway and television in recent years -- choreographing ""Choir Boy,"" ""Once on This Island"" and NBC's ""Jesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert"" -- Ms. Brown appears as dedicated as ever to her own company, Camille A. Brown & Dancers, both as a performer and lead creator.

Building on ""BLACK GIRL: Linguistic Play,"" which depicted everyday activities of black American girlhood, ""ink"" mines its movement from gestures and rituals of the African diaspora -- a broad palette that Ms. Brown, who grew up in Jamaica, Queens, blends with precision and (what looks like) ease. Featuring a propulsive percussion ensemble led by Allison Miller, the show begins with the sound of a single drum and distant chant, a call to the Yoruba deity Elegba -- who, as Ms. Brown notes in the program, ""opens and clears the space as guardian, protector and communicator.""","Ms. Brown's superbly danced ""ink,"" the final piece in her trilogy on African-American identity, flies by — a conclusion and a conjuring.",cecbd4a2-d2a4-53ec-8b87-3db546073cce,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/07/arts/07camillebrown1-print/07camillebrown-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=61039ad6ddf3703f32d45cbb0f49be0948c4c29fd9627b09c22e7d14f09a7ab1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Camille A.

Economy,Income Inequality and the Ills Behind It,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/business/economy/income-inequality-and-the-problems-behind-it.html,"Tyler Cowen, a professor at George Mason University, said, ""Inequality itself is the wrong thing to look at."" The real problem is slow growth.

Is it time to stop obsessing about inequality? Perhaps it was President Obama's speech last December, calling the nation's vast income gap ""the defining challenge of our time."" The American publication of the French economist Thomas Piketty's blockbuster ""Capital in the Twenty-First Century"" must have helped. Whatever the reason, suddenly inequality seems to be not only at the top of the liberal agenda, but in the thoughts of concerned American voters. Yet amid the denunciations of inequity as the major evil of our era, persistent voices -- mostly but not exclusively from the political right -- have been nibbling away at the concern over distribution that is taking over the zeitgeist. Some of these counterclaims are somewhat dubious -- relying, for instance, on novel definitions of income and wealth to conclude that inequality is in fact declining.

Some find support in the ant and the grasshopper. As one reader articulated in a recent email: ""Those who deserve to be poor should be poor. Those who desire to be rich should be rich. That is what justice looks like."" Still, aside from these extreme views, the critique does add up to a coherent argument: The income gap cleaving society between the rich and the rest may, in fact, be a red herring. It is not only that the accumulation of income at the apex of the pyramid of success is not the nation's main problem. There is little we can do to redress it anyway. ""The returns to growth are going to people in other countries, most notably China, and generally to people with high I.Q., no matter where they live,"" said Tyler Cowen, a professor of economics at George Mason University and a contributor to the Economic View column in The New York Times. ""I don't really know how you could undermine this dynamic, short of wrecking the world. Trying to deny that logic is going to fail or worse, backfire."" Mr. Cowen, who describes himself as a libertarian with a lowercase ""l,"" is the author of ""Average Is Over: Powering America Beyond the Age of the Great Stagnation,"" (Dutton, 2013), which posits that technology and globalization have essentially split the labor market in two: high and low earners. Far fewer stable jobs are left over in the middle to support what through much of the 20th century we called the middle class.

In his view, the defining challenge of our era is that workers in the bottom half of the distribution can no longer trust that their living standard will double every generation. ""The right moral question is 'are poor people rising to a higher standard of living?' Inequality itself is the wrong thing to look at,"" he told me. The real problem is slow growth. There are nuances to this narrative. N. Gregory Mankiw, the Harvard economist who was a top economic adviser to President George W. Bush and the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, contends it would be better to live in a less lopsided society. ""More equality does probably mean greater social and political harmony,"" he told me. Mr. Cowen does not buy that, recalling his frequent trips to New York in the 1970s, when it was much more equal yet much less harmonious. But otherwise the analyses and the prescriptions are similar: Technological progress has benefited well-educated workers with skills that are not easily automated and who can profitably deploy advances in technology. It has undercut less skilled workers whose jobs could be performed cheaply with software or machines.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions. ""The best way to address rising inequality is to focus on increasing educational attainment,"" Professor Mankiw said. Mr. Cowen adds other potentially useful policies, like expanding the earned-income tax credit or using urban policy to, say, make it easier for people who are not rich to live in San Francisco. The arguments rest on broadly the same political philosophy. As Mr. Mankiw put it in a recent radio conversation with Professor Piketty, ""The question is, How do we help people at the bottom, rather than thwart people at the top?"" And neither Mr. Cowen nor Mr. Mankiw seems hopeful that the inequality dial will move significantly. ""Policies that address the symptom rather than the cause include higher taxes and a more generous social safety net,"" Mr. Mankiw said. ""The magnitude of what we can plausibly do with these policy tools is small compared to the size of the growing income gap.""

Mr. Cowen put it this way: ""We might take people who grow up poor and stay poor and turn them into the equivalent of a midlevel carpenter. We would have a better country. We would have less crime. But it wouldn't change the global distribution of gains."" There is evidence that inequality among the lower rungs of the socio-economic ladder can have deleterious consequences, stunting the ambition of the poor. But even avowedly liberal social scientists have had a tough time figuring out the negative consequences of the rise of the 1 percent. In fact, not that long ago, much of Mr. Mankiw's and Mr. Cowen's analysis was shared across the political spectrum. Just over two years ago, a substantial majority of economists polled by the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business agreed that ""one of the leading reasons for rising U.S. income inequality over the past three decades is that technological change has affected workers with some skill sets differently than others."" As inequality increased during the 1990s, President Bill Clinton proposed education -- rather than redistribution -- as the preferred prescription. And yet the American left has moved. ""I view opinion as in flux,"" Mr. Cowen said. ""I find that fewer and fewer people, especially outside of academia, accept the skill-biased technical change story and more and more look to politics, privilege, rent-seeking and the like."" So what happened? For starters, the concentration of income at the top has become even more pronounced than it was during the Clinton administration. At the same time, Supreme Court rulings allowing a rush of private money into political campaigns have underscored how plutocracy could purchase the policies it wants to maintain its privilege, locking inequity in forever.

Education, meanwhile, has not proved to be the silver bullet it once appeared to be, contributing to our stark inequities rather than mitigating them. The college graduation rate of Americans in the bottom fifth of the income distribution rose to 9 percent for those born between 1979 and 1982, from 5 percent for those born in the early 1960s. Among the richest fifth, the graduation rate rose to 54 percent from 36 percent, according to Martha J. Bailey and Susan M. Dynarski of the University of Michigan. What is more, workers with a college education may still earn substantially more than those without one. But the incomes of workers with a bachelor's degree have barely grown over the last four decades. ""Education isn't doing it,"" said Timothy Smeeding, an economist at the University of Wisconsin. The Great Recession seals the new narrative. If the financial crisis proved that bankers can easily bend policy in their favor, the sharp decline in the living standards of so many Americans reminded everybody that workers across much of the distribution have been losing ground for a long time, even as incomes at the very top have soared. Which gets to the nub of the issue, even for those most interested in defending the advantages of free-market capitalism. As the richest Americans capture a larger and larger share of the fruits of growth, for many people the essential economic question becomes: What is the point of creating a larger pie? ""As long as all the boats are rising that gives us some hope,"" Professor Smeeding said. ""The problem is that the middle class isn't getting that. That's the post-Great Recession reality.""",An argument can be made that the accumulation of income at the top of the success pyramid is not the nation's main problem and little can be done about it anyway.,921d8613-b957-5342-b177-468db3165d35,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/02/29/business/eduardo-porter/eduardo-porter-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2014&h=900&w=600&s=e0f5bc829638945c9b9699e41305b013e6fb17053b1c05c78d9b02c6891b47ef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Eduardo Porter,921d8613-b957-5342-b177-468db3165d35,N24News/imgs/921d8613-b957-5342-b177-468db3165d35.jpg,8
Opinion,"Rich New Yorkers, How's That Census Coming?",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/25/opinion/census-new-york.html,"You're a wealthy New Yorker who fled the city during the coronavirus pandemic, and you haven't yet filled out the census.

Listen, I understand why you left. We were all scared. Maybe you're older, or you have a compromised immune system. Maybe you have kids and needed access to schools, reliable child care and a backyard where they can run and play. Maybe you'd just rather be at your house in the Hamptons.

I'm not judging. I'm just asking you to do your civic duty and fill out the census.

It turns out that some of the lowest census response rates in New York City this year are in the wealthiest neighborhoods. Citywide, the response rate was 54 percent as of this week, according to city data. New York needs to improve that before the Oct. 31 deadline to ensure it gets the resources and congressional seats it deserves. But in SoHo, the response rate is only 44 percent. On the Upper East Side, it's 48 percent. In Midtown, it's 40 percent. Truly pathetic.

The man from the beginning (the taut, compact Luca Marazia) wanders through, occasionally threatened by the hordes, losing and regaining the light-of-humanity orb. But he keeps ceding the stage to some dumb tribal dance or an uninspired variation on the tired formula by which a woman is passed around and manipulated by a group of men. It's not a good sign when the most striking section involves dancers checking their own pulses.

Every so often, the lights brighten and the music swerves from minimalist strings by Alexander Balanescu or Philip Glass into club beats by the Danish electronic music producer Trentemoller. The soggy dancing this inspires, like a rave for the undead, is momentarily diverting. But the work takes itself seriously, reprising all of its weak motifs at the end, before topping off Mr. Rushton's male fantasy with some female nudity.

Television,Zendaya Jumps From Disney to Drug Binges in HBO's Graphic 'Euphoria',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/13/arts/television/zendaya-euphoria-hbo.html,"It's been only 16 months since Zendaya took her final bow on the Disney Channel, but her new HBO series, ""Euphoria,"" makes one thing clear: The parent-approved portion of her TV career is already ancient history. In the series, debuting Sunday, Zendaya stars as Rue, a high school junior committed to numbing herself with vodka and whatever drugs she can get her hands on, after a failed stint in rehab. Between bouts of unconsciousness, she narrates a dark, graphically-depicted world in which the local dealers have barely hit puberty, fentanyl is rampant and her classmates' sex is not only casual, but frequently documented. ""It's 2019: Nudes are the currency of love,"" Rue explains in the first episode. Based on the Israeli series of the same name and executive produced by Drake, ""Euphoria"" is a rare foray into teen drama for HBO. The creator and showrunner Sam Levinson (son of the filmmaker Barry) drew on his own troubled adolescence to tell the story, which channels earlier raw teen tales like ""Kids"" and ""Skins"" while tackling contemporary realities like active-shooter drills and revenge porn.

She is confident the ""Euphoria"" audience is unlikely to overlap with Disney's target demographic. ""I don't think any of my 8-year-old fans know"" that this show exists, she said, smiling. ""If they do, I don't think their parents will let them watch it."" Born in Oakland to schoolteacher parents, Zendaya (last name Coleman) landed her first Disney gig in 2010 at age 13. When she wasn't playing an aspiring dancer on ""Shake It Up,"" and later a spy in ""K.C. Undercover,"" she was busy building a slim but exciting resume. In ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017), her deceptively small part as Peter Parker's sarcastic classmate Michelle led to a third-act twist that unmasked her as the franchise's infamous love interest, MJ. Zendaya reignites the chemistry with her superhero co-star Tom Holland in the forthcoming sequel ""Spider-Man: Far From Home."" She also delivered a nimble, exuberant performance as a trapeze artist in the movie-musical ""The Greatest Showman"" (2017). By mid-2018, after wrapping her eight-year run on the Disney Channel with the ""K.C. Undercover"" finale, Zendaya found herself worried about her next project for the first time in almost a decade. Then she read the pilot script for ""Euphoria.""

""I knew if I wasn't a part of this show, I'd be miserable,"" she said. At the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills , Zendaya, 22, collapsed on a couch. The stylish actress had spent a long day in maroon velvet stilettos, but she was still eager to talk about why she wanted this role so badly and whether she would be able to break Rue's more vulgar habits in time for the ""Spider-Man"" press tour. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Did ""Euphoria"" appeal to you because it was such a break from Disney? There was no strategic plan. After shooting ""The Greatest Showman"" and ""Spider-Man,"" I went back to my Disney show, which is kind of like going to college and then having to go back and do the same grade over and over again. Not that I didn't appreciate having a job. But it's like you turn a switch on and do it, and then you get turned off and go home. I wanted more. Upon talking to Sam and finding out that Rue is really an incarnation of him and his battles with addiction and depression and a multitude of other things that everyone deals with, it made sense why I connected with her. You don't do drugs. What do you have in common with Rue? I feel like she's a version of myself with different choices and circumstances. Rue is a good person, she just doesn't know it. She's in pain. There's something innocent and redeeming about her that reminds you that she's a human first and an addict second.

Is the intent of the show to be deliberately provocative? I don't find it that shocking, to be honest. People will. I kind of accepted the fact that it would be polarizing. I found a little calm in that. Whether people like it or not, it's real. I'm telling somebody's story. Just because it's not happening to you doesn't mean it's not happening all the time, every day. It's hard for me to speak on addiction because it's not something I have dealt with directly. But I still had friends who were dealing with things, and I had to help them through it.

Were you nervous to step into a role this dark and occasionally graphic? I was really nervous because I wanted to do well. It's like going from nothing to everything -- there were no steps in between. That's why people think it's such a stretch for me to play this character. There's a lot of people who probably think I can't do it because they don't truly understand my personality. And I get it: I'm a Disney kid. There's a lot to prove. Sam told me I was on a mood board he made for Rue, and I didn't believe him because I felt like there's no way he's seen anything that I've done. He took a risk on me, but he doesn't see it that way. He would always say, ""Yo, Z, I'm not worried about you."" I appreciate that. How did you come to trust Sam to handle your onscreen relationship with Hunter Schafer, who plays Jules, one of the first major transgender characters to appear in a high school drama? Anybody who meets or talks to Sam feels a sense of comfort around him. He's a very open book. I'm glad that he wrote himself as me because he could've written it as a white dude, and then I would never have the opportunity to play a character like this. He directs most of the episodes, but if he's not directing, we have all female directors, which is great. He's also very collaborative and allowed us to fuse our experiences and our feelings into the character. Sam and Hunter have had long, in-depth conversations about life. And Hunter is an angel of a human. She's brilliant. It's not hard to be in love with her onscreen.

Yeah, I talked to the director [Jon Watts] prior to auditioning, and he said she gets bigger as the thing goes on. I was like: ""Dope. I'm here for the long game."" I didn't know she was going to be the sarcastic introvert. She's a very guarded person and she doesn't let a lot of people in. In the first movie, we just saw her shell. We kind of explore the softer sides of her in this upcoming one. Now she has to be more vulnerable because she likes Peter. You pushed back against the Disney Channel's original plan for ""K.C. Undercover"" -- you wanted to be a producer, you wanted the title changed from ""Super Awesome Katy,"" you wanted to feature a family of color. Did you feel Disney needed to develop more diverse female characters? Yeah, 1,000 percent. It was very necessary. It was either they did it, or I didn't do it. It's understanding your worth. If you're in a place where you can move the needle, then do it. I've been able to help show the young Disney kids other paths to go. So hopefully it makes it a little easier to make that kid-to-grown-up transition that everybody puts all this emphasis on. Have you already noticed a change in the types of roles you're being offered? I still get the corny stuff. It's cool. I feel like I can do [""Euphoria""] and still have another world outside of it where I can do family movies and fun things like that. I'm trying to break the habit of using the F-word now because I use it so much as Rue, and in life. I'm about to go on tour for ""Spider-Man."" It's a wonderful family movie. I can't be dropping F-bombs.","In an interview, the longtime Disney Channel star discusses her ""scary"" move into explicit, provocative television.",a8f55190-a9c7-5daf-988f-a53bd3e8e0fb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/16/arts/16zendaya1/16zendaya1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=fd56a363a9defcb1ed0f26d1e8125d8ad5144aedbf70a471d7def28d3d921f33&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Zendaya plays an addicted teen in HBO's ""Euphoria,"" which shares little with the family-friendly shows that made her famous.",a8f55190-a9c7-5daf-988f-a53bd3e8e0fb,N24News/imgs/a8f55190-a9c7-5daf-988f-a53bd3e8e0fb.jpg,3
Music,Virus Pushes the Bang on a Can Marathon Online,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/arts/music/bang-on-a-can-marathon-coronavirus.html,"It was already going to be a year of transformation for the beloved Bang on a Can Marathon. A New York new-music institution since 1987, the annual event was set to expand into a new three-day festival, Long Play, spread over several Brooklyn performance spaces. Then came the coronavirus pandemic. With Long Play canceled, the Bang on a Can collective's founders and leaders -- the composers David Lang, Michael Gordon and Julia Wolfe -- opted to try another first, if in a more familiar format: a six-hour livestreamed marathon, starting at 3 p.m. Eastern on Sunday, at marathon2020.bangonacan.org. Jazz figures like Vijay Iyer and Mary Halvorson will share a digital space with experimental-music veterans like Meredith Monk and George Lewis. Younger composers have had new pieces commissioned. The production values will be unpolished, but the marathon -- which has varied in venue and length over the years -- has never been too fancy. The emphasis on Sunday aims to be, as it always has been, on free-spirited variety, representation across musical generations and the intermingling of genres and artistic scenes.

How long did it take to reset the plans for this year? DAVID LANG It took us a while to reorient ourselves. We had this gigantic idea of how to expand the marathon into Long Play. I'm sure we'll do that again, should the world ever get back to normal. But we have these people who depend on us, who have no money. We have young people who are looking for opportunities. There are so many people who are in need of a venue. JULIA WOLFE It really came after a lot of discussion and soul-searching about what is important. Everyone's getting compensated. We talked about a lot of different approaches -- and came back to what we do. We started with a marathon in 1987. Over the years we've had so many amazing soloists; the Bang on a Can All-Stars [the collective's resident ensemble] is made up of people who appeared as soloists. So we're very oriented toward spectacular individual players. MICHAEL GORDON Part of the reason it takes so long to get a physical festival together is that everyone has to come to New York. And everyone has a different fee, and different requirements. You know, the classic thing: ""organic cherry tomatoes in my dressing room."" Less than a month ago, we were like: ""OK, we're going to do this."" And then all of a sudden you also realize no one's traveling. There's no conflicts. It's lightning speed, putting this together. There are a lot of distinct musical personalities on the schedule.

WOLFE Meredith kicking it off is very significant. First of all, we just made a beautiful recording with her, so we're really proud of that. And she has a long history with the organization. It was a curatorial decision, from early on, that this is multigenerational; it's multigenre. It's about the power of the music and the performers that engaged us.

What are you particularly looking forward to hearing on Sunday? WOLFE I'm particularly excited about the commissions. Dai Wei is writing a new piece for Todd Reynolds -- for his electronics, and for his incredible violin chops. LANG I have a category of highlights: the people who are pushing the boundaries of the worlds that they are in. I'm interested in people like Moor Mother. I'm interested in Ian Chang. Meara O'Reilly. Mary Halvorson.

GORDON When we first started the marathon, we asked George Lewis to come and perform. And he set up all these electronics and a Mac computer. And everything crashed. I thought, ""Oh, what's this going to be, a flop?"" And then he did the most incredible trombone solo. I was totally floored. And now here we are, a little more than 30 years later. To get to hear him, it's special. You come full circle.

There are also lots of artists on the schedule who are closer to the beginning of their careers, like Shelley Washington. WOLFE She has a really strong connection to playing the sax in bands, and playing jazz. She's a very broad musician. We have some great video shots of her, from a Bang on a Can summer festival, looking ecstatic. We stayed in touch. It's fun again to pair her with the Bang on a Can All-Star clarinetist Ken Thomson, because they worked so well together at the summer institute. LANG Eight of the younger composers -- I wouldn't call them ""young"" any more -- were people who came through our summer institute. When we started the marathon, we were trying to figure out people for whom Bang on a Can is central. Shelley Washington is a great example. She's an amazing person who would have been fine without us. But she found us. So we want to make sure we can help her, in this moment.","The beloved New York musical event was set to expand this year, but will instead be livestreamed on Sunday.",674c7050-a13b-5385-9bdd-f8dafc781441,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/02/arts/01marathon-1/01marathon-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=f613f01ef160fa580257add7334453943c8ce33ddefffebf5d54eece9efedee0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The composers David Lang, Julia Wolfe and Michael Gordon, the founders and leaders of the Bang on a Can collective, in 2017.",674c7050-a13b-5385-9bdd-f8dafc781441,N24News/imgs/674c7050-a13b-5385-9bdd-f8dafc781441.jpg,12
Movies,'Spice World' & Me,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/02/movies/spiceworld-me.html,"In the summer of 1998 ""Titanic"" was six months into its marathon run in theaters, revelations about President Bill Clinton's infidelity were hurtling him toward impeachment and I, a kid living in a small English village, was subjecting my younger brothers to weekly screenings of ""Spice World"" on DVD . I had recently turned 8 years old and believed, quite simply, that this film was the best thing adults had ever created. ""Spice mania"" was at its peak: A typical music magazine cover at that time shouted ""Spice Girls: We're the biggest pop band that ever lived!"" I was all in, playing Geri in schoolyard concerts and daydreaming about clomping around in platform shoes once I became old enough to be the mistress of my own wardrobe. I loved that they were also British, that they were cheeky, that they talked about being best friends. Their music itself was almost incidental to what they represented to me . Their first (and only) feature film was announced, shot and released in a span of eight months, coinciding with the group's second album, ""Spiceworld."" The music industry machine around the Girls was churning out content as fast as it could, and tastemakers were not wholly impressed. In his review for the British movie magazine Empire, Ian Nathan wrote, ""the shock here is sheer dullness."" The film critic Roger Ebert gave it half a star, musing, ""What can you say about five women whose principal distinguishing characteristic is that they have different names?""

Those searching for a definition of ""camp"" ahead of this year's Met Gala would have done well to watch ""Spice World."" There are dream sequences, an alien invasion, a boat accident and army drills ; they say things like ""Hold onto your knickers, girls"" and ""No more Mr. Nice Spice."" There's perhaps the greatest dress-up montage in movie history, with Mel C as Danny Zuko and Geri as Mel C; there's Meat Loaf as a bus driver and Roger Moore as a Bond-like villain with a pet piglet. There's Mel B wearing an astronaut suit over a tiger print bralette and Geri wearing a feathered bodysuit; there's liberal breaking of the fourth wall. This joyful pandemonium lit up all the pleasure receptors of my 8-year-old brain.

But first loves rarely last. As the years passed, my world -- and the lenses through which I understood it -- became more complicated. I took literary theory classes at university. I discovered feminism's overlapping waves, how ecological and human distress intersect, the way colonialism has shaped the world's imagination. The Spice Girls's relentless pep and revealing outfits became a little embarrassing, an easy shorthand for my childhood naivete. Who needs ""girl power"" when you have roll-up cigarettes and Luce Irigaray? This was England at the turn of the last decade, and the indie rock bands I loved were mostly made up of scrawny white men with artistic bangs. When people asked me which album I bought first, I was evasive, loathe to name the ""Spice"" cassette that I had played until it broke.

The Spice Girls was, after all, a pop group assembled by hungry music-industry executives, and managed, during the years of their stratospheric rise, by Simon Fuller, who went on to found the ""Idol"" reality competition franchise. They leaned into merchandising and endorsement deals with an intensity quite un like any group before them , putting their name on advertising campaigns for candy, soft drinks and even supermarkets. What did ""girl power"" even mean? Making as much money as possible? Now that I was firmly in that stage of life when you have ""lofty"" ideals and understand the world better than people both older and younger than you -- also known as your early 20s -- that hardly seemed original or feminist. When the group announced reunions in 2007, 2012 and 2016, I wondered what they really had to offer beyond nostalgia. Recently I spent a few weeks at my parents' house, and came across the beloved ""Spice World"" DVD . I watched it, surrendering to the same impulse that a few days earlier had led me to reread my teenage diaries. It was a delight -- a silly, uncomplicated delight that hit my brain like the first cool fall breeze. Directed by Bob Spiers, who also directed the original ""Absolutely Fabulous"" episodes, the film is much smarter and more self-aware than I once gave it credit for. It pokes fun at the mainstream cultural institutions the group's success brought them into contact with -- the movie industry (both Hollywood and independent filmmakers), London's tabloids, the music world, the British class structure. Best of all, ""Spice World"" satirizes the Spice Girls themselves.

The question always hovering around industry-manufactured pop acts -- especially female ones -- is the extent to which they're driving their own brand. In ""Spice World,"" the Girls want us to know that they are fully in on the joke. ""Do godmothers get stretch marks?"" Posh asks. ""Do you think I'm always going to be seen as Baby Spice?"" Emma asks, ""even when I'm [gulp] 30?"" The plot climaxes with Posh taking the wheel of their tour bus in her strappy stilettos, and saving the day. ( Despite this convincing show of unity, all was clearly not well in the real Spice world: Geri quit the band before the movie came to DVD, citing ""differences between us."" ) As the credits roll, we cut to the set of the movie we've just watche d with the cast members milling around, discussing their roles. ""They want me to play their road manager,"" Richard E. Grant says into his cellphone. ""Well, I don't want to end my career."" The Girls know all the reasons you dismiss them, and they're forcing you to laugh with them, instead.

The Spice Girls were absolutely working the (very sexist) system, and making a lot of money off it, but they were doing it slyly, with a wink and a grin. They were, I think, misunderstood at the time, and I wonder if an irreverent, breezy group like theirs could even exist today. So much of the conversation around present-day pop stardom has become serious and fraught, with debates over whether to ""cancel"" artists for saying the wrong thing. Mainstream feminism has morphed into yet another set of rituals for women to perform in public, another abstract standard by which to judge them. ""Spice World,"" speaking to me from the ancient pop past (a.k.a. the '90s) , was a reminder that there should be space for many ways of being a powerful woman in public. No, ""girl power"" is not going to fix structural gender inequality. But a fun film telling young girls to look after each other and beware of creepy men seems fine to me. And maybe fine is enough. Maybe it's disingenuous to demand more of our pop stars than that.","I went from loving the chaotic Spice Girls movie to dismissing it in college.

Real Estate,Midtown Condo With Views for $30.68 Million,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/realestate/one57-condo-sells-for-30683372-dollars.html,"A sprawling aerie on the 53rd floor of One57, the sky-piercing condominium that has attracted demigods of international business and finance, sold to a mystery buyer, one seemingly versed in the teachings of a much higher power, for $30,683,372.50 and was the most expensive closed sale of the week, according to city records.

The monthly charges for the 5,475-square-foot sponsor unit, No. 53B, which was combined early on with 53C for a total of five bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms, are $10,408.

The purchaser, who was brought to the deal by Raphael De Niro and Danielle Sevier of Douglas Elliman Real Estate, was shielded, like many of the building's buyers, under a limited liability company. This one is named Hebrews 3:4, an apparent reference to a passage in the New Testament of the Bible that reads in part: ""For every house is built by some man; but he that built all things is God.""

Mr. De Niro, citing a confidentiality agreement, said he could not disclose much about his client. But Gary Barnett, the founder and president of the Extell Development Company, which developed the 90-story skyscraper at 157 West 57th Street, said the buyer was domestic and, he believed, planned to live in the apartment with the family. Many buyers at One57 have been deep-pocketed foreigners, among them, Guoqing Chen, a founder of Hainan Airlines, part of the HNA Group, one of China's largest private airline companies, who recently bought a floor-through unit on the 57th floor for nearly $47.4 million.",A sprawling five-bedroom aerie on the 53rd floor of One57 was the sale of the week.,7447febb-1c8c-51dc-a2a4-11ca77be669f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/03/realestate/03TICKET/03TICKET-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=76b0f7ff315a904475426454a98d5c490876a45f1ac709ec25b9c16397449741&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The vitreous One57 condo tower,7447febb-1c8c-51dc-a2a4-11ca77be669f,N24News/imgs/7447febb-1c8c-51dc-a2a4-11ca77be669f.jpg,7
Media,"Netflix for Conservatives? Fox News Introduces Fox Nation, a Streaming App",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/business/media/fox-news-nation-streaming.html,"If you have ever wondered about the culinary skills of a ""Fox & Friends"" co-host, wonder no longer. On the new show ""Cooking With Steve Doocy,"" the pink-faced Fox News anchor makes chili with Dr. Oz, shares a kitchen with Kellyanne Conway and whips up stromboli with Anthony Scaramucci and his wife. ""Steve poured the wine!"" Mr. Scaramucci wrote in an email. ""It was an awesome time."" Fox News viewers are fiercely loyal to their network. But will they pay to watch a ""Fox & Friend"" work a griddle? That, in a gourmet nutshell, is the question for Fox Nation, the subscription-only streaming service -- think Netflix for conservatives -- that debuts on Tuesday and ushers the cable news business into a brave, uncertain new era. For $5.99 a month, viewers can purchase on-demand access to live political commentary and hundreds of hours of original programming from familiar Fox News faces. Another ""Fox & Friend,"" Brian Kilmeade, has a history show called ""What Made America Great."" Maria Bartiromo interviews Eric Trump for ""The First Family."" ""Borked"" covers the 1987 Supreme Court non-confirmation of Robert H. Bork.

True-crime enthusiasts can opt for ""The Fuhrman Diaries,"" in which famous cases are examined by Mark Fuhrman, the former Los Angeles police detective who was revealed as a racist during the O. J. Simpson trial. Fox Nation may be the id of Fox News, but it is also a potentially shrewd bet for the Murdoch family, which is testing the digital waters ahead of news rivals CNN and MSNBC. Networks like ESPN, CBS, and HBO have introduced stand-alone streaming apps as audiences move away from traditional TV. Lachlan Murdoch, who will oversee a reconstituted Fox empire after the company sells most of its entertainment assets to the Walt Disney Company, is ready to modernize. And Fox News, with juggernaut ratings and ad revenue, commands a devoted audience. ""We have fans,"" said John Finley, the executive overseeing Fox Nation. ""Other news organizations simply have viewers."" Still, every bet needs a hedge. Unlike HBO Now and CBS All Access, Fox Nation does not include any shows from the network's regular broadcast, and its news-side anchors, like Chris Wallace and Shepard Smith, are not participating. In an effort to make sure it does not sap the ratings of the prime-time shows, Fox Nation will end its live programming around 7 p.m., in time for viewers to switch to cable for Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham.

For now, Fox News is not divulging the number of subscribers who have signed on for Fox Nation, saying only that it was pleased by the initial response. About 70 percent of sign-ups came from a mobile device, Mr. Finley said, calling it a promising sign for the product's appeal to technologically adept consumers. About that: The median age of a Fox News viewer is 65, hardly the target audience for a streaming app. Even Mr. Kilmeade, in an interview last week, conceded that cable TV was becoming passe with a new generation.

""It's scary, right?"" Mr. Kilmeade said, recalling that his college-age son was the only student in his dormitory with a cable subscription. ""He's like, 'Dad, nobody's watching cable anymore.'"" Fox News, whose website has enormous traffic, is keen to point out that the median age of its TV viewers is a year younger than MSNBC's. The network also beats CNN and MSNBC in the coveted advertising demographic of 25- to 54-year-olds, although cable news viewership skews older over all.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG Research, said Fox News should not be concerned about its older audience. ""My mom's over 70, and she has a Roku,"" he said in an interview. ""These devices are becoming so easy."" But he faulted the network for wading, not diving, into the streaming sphere. ""They don't want to take Fox News and offer it directly to consumers; they want to see if they can skim off the top some incremental dollars from cord-cutters,"" Mr. Greenfield said. ""If these companies had guts, it wouldn't be ESPN Plus, it would be ESPN. It wouldn't be Fox Nation, it'd be Fox News.""

For now, Fox Nation is being pitched as complementary content for Fox News ""superfans,"" as the network likes to call them. ""They're all in; they feel like they know you,"" Mr. Kilmeade said.

Jesse Watters is planning a behind-the-scenes supplement for the panel discussion show ""The Five,"" and the archives of his man-on-the-street interviews, which originally aired on ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" will be available. ""They're going to have a warehouse of all the old 'Watters' World' segments,"" Mr. Watters said in an interview, pausing a moment before adding: ""Almost all of them."" A notorious segment set in New York's Chinatown, which was widely denounced as racist toward Asians, has been omitted. Mr. Watters, among the network's more youthful anchors, said he had a cable subscription at home but had trouble turning it on. ""I get frustrated, and I'll just watch Netflix instead,"" he said. ""I'm watching 'Making a Murderer.' I'm three episodes in, and I'm obsessed."" As for Mr. Fuhrman, he has been a regular Fox News analyst for years. Mr. Finley, the Fox executive, said he was not worried about granting the former detective a starring role. ""The Fox audience is long familiar with Mark and things that have been said about him in the past,"" he said. ""It was not a matter of concern."" Mr. Kilmeade, of ""Fox & Friends,"" said that ""What Made America Great"" was not a political show. But there is a Trump-y tinge to the proceedings: He tours the Hermitage, the former plantation of President Trump's favorite predecessor, Andrew Jackson; and climbs Mount Rushmore with Ryan Zinke, the president's interior secretary.","For viewers who can't get enough of ""Fox & Friends,"" a $5.99-a-month service courts the cable news network's superfans.",d3a4a970-6c7a-5ef8-a01a-9ff6168465ba,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/27/business/27FOXNATION-02/27FOXNATION-02-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=383b84a577a0a36313efc4c41e49a69e3a6d6eee5e575d0c946f33cab767e823&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jesse Watters, a host on Fox Nation, during a rehearsal.

Theater,"Broadway Sets Box-Office Record, Powered by 'Hamilton' and Springsteen",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/theater/broadway-sets-box-office-record.html,"A rapping Hamilton and a (quietly) rocking Boss propelled Broadway's box office to new heights over the past year, as rising demand and even faster-rising ticket prices shattered industry records. Over all, the 67 shows that ran over the last season brought in $1.7 billion from 13.8 million patrons, according to figures released Tuesday by the Broadway League. ""We've never had as many big hits,"" said Charlotte St. Martin, the president of the League, which represents producers and presenters. Broadway has been on an upswing for five years, powered by a surge in New York City tourism and a resurgence in enthusiasm for musical theater. Even so, the theater season that ended Sunday was remarkably lucrative, as producers have become more sophisticated -- and more aggressive -- about pricing.

The new pacesetter, ""Hamilton,"" benefiting from the first full season in which it regularly charged $849 for the best seats at the Richard Rodgers Theater, grossed $161 million in New York. The musical, about the life and death of the founding father Alexander Hamilton, grossed more than five other musicals that sold more tickets but charged lower prices, including ""Wicked,"" ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King."" At the same time, Bruce Springsteen, who can sell out arenas or stadiums, delivered a dramatic lesson on the economic value of scarcity, fetching a jaw-dropping $503 average ticket price for his ""Springsteen on Broadway,"" a blend of stripped-down songs and ruminative storytelling that he has been performing since October in the 948-seat Walter Kerr Theater. By contrast the average Broadway ticket was $123, and even at ""Hamilton"" it was only $282. [Sign up for Theater Update, a weekly email of news and features.] Because of a quirk in the way the trade association tracks data, this past season consisted of 53 weeks, making season-to-season comparisons imperfect, but for the first 52 weeks grosses were up an eye-popping 14.4 percent. Attendance crept up a far more modest 1.6 percent.

Dynamic pricing -- the practice of varying prices to reflect consumer demand -- is not new to Broadway. But this past season, producers became increasingly deft at it, and that's why revenue is growing so much faster than attendance. Theatergoers generally pay a premium for a seat in the center orchestra. It often costs less to see shows on a Tuesday night than on a Saturday, and more during the last week of December (Christmas!) than the first week of January (cold!). The three shows with the highest average prices this past season -- ""Hamilton,"" ""Springsteen"" and ""Dear Evan Hansen"" -- are all in midsize theaters, meaning they had a limited supply of tickets despite enormous demand. And the premiums they charged had an added benefit for producers -- helping reduce profiteering by resellers, and reclaiming money for investors and artists. ""Dynamic pricing is a reality today, not just in our industry, but in many,"" said Nick Scandalios, executive vice president of the Nederlander Organization, which operates nine Broadway theaters. ""There are many, many, many inexpensive tickets on Broadway, but there is no reason a Springsteen ticket or a 'Hamilton' ticket should be less than it is, from a supply and demand standpoint, because the price is reasonably matching what the consumer considers to be the value."" The most striking example this past season: The producers of ""Hello, Dolly!,"" recognizing the intense enthusiasm for Bette Midler's performance in the lead role, charged $998 for front row seats late last year, counting on her biggest fans to pay for the pleasure of proximity.

The top-grossing musicals were ""Hamilton"" ($161 million), ""The Lion King"" ($113 million), ""Wicked"" ($96 million), ""Hello, Dolly!"" ($91 million) and ""Dear Evan Hansen"" ($88 million). None of the season's new musicals opened early enough to outgross those longer-running hits, but some are off to a strong start, particularly ""Frozen"" and ""Mean Girls."" Plays generally gross much less than musicals because they tend to have shorter runs. Just 11 percent of the season's grosses went to plays; top-grossing among them was ""The Play That Goes Wrong,"" a British farce that was the only play to run all 53 weeks of the season, bringing in $19 million.

There has been much hand-wringing -- with good reason -- about the plight of plays on Broadway, where audiences tend to favor musicals. But this past season saw some remarkable signs of financial strength for plays with familiar titles, big stars or strong buzz. ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,"" a two-part drama that is a sequel to the enormously popular novels, is shaping up to be one of the top-grossing plays in Broadway history, bringing in $18 million in its first 10 weeks. And four play revivals have recently been selling strongly -- more strongly than many musicals: ""The Iceman Cometh,"" starring Denzel Washington; ""The Boys in the Band,"" starring Jim Parsons and Zachary Quinto; ""Angels in America,"" starring Andrew Garfield and Nathan Lane; and ""Three Tall Women,"" starring Glenda Jackson and Laurie Metcalf.","The theater season that just ended was remarkably lucrative as producers have become more sophisticated, and more aggressive, about setting prices.",5438ae8c-ee5c-5c1c-9641-2c423a3b9604,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/31/arts/31season/31season-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=2c87fc6de38517ea44cec647f4ad32ab3d1e75dc534401ca7b5ee85a97434401&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,What should we see?

Many threads of emo get woven together by the savvy pop producer Benny Blanco on the eerily effective ""Roses,"" from his new album ""Friends Keep Secrets."" First comes Juice WRLD, the leading petulant emoter in hip-hop, his voice an exhausted peal: ""Still feeling dead when I think about you/I can't do a damn thing when I'm without you."" Then comes Brendon Urie -- frontman for Panic! at the Disco -- who arrives with an almost sensual, R&B take on heartbreak, groaning, ""Every look you give it's like I'm see-through."" This successful collaboration across generations and styles is a reminder that they were never that far apart to begin with. JON CARAMANICA

A virtuoso singer and multi-instrumentalist, Jacob Collier raids musical tombs, yanking ideas from across the natural world. But he doesn't stir everything into a chilled-out groove; instead he shines a bold light on every trick he uses, moving from reference to reference as if flipping tabs on a browser. This is beat-driven music that's meant for headphone listening, not the dance floor. On ""With the Love in My Heart,"" you might catch a few direct references: to J Dilla-influenced jazz drumming, the wagging synths of 1980s funk (a la Zapp & Roger), high-school drumlines. The track comes from ""Djesse, Vol. 1,"" a new album he recorded with the Metropole Orkest. This is the first in a four-disc package that Collier plans to release, one album at a time, over the coming year. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

""Championships,"" Meek Mill's first full-length statement following his release from jail earlier this year, didn't fully capture what makes him so invigorating as a rapper. He's an orator, and anything that prevents him from talk-rapping -- namely, the dictates of song construction, especially when it comes to working within a melodic framework -- is a distraction. So it's appropriate that the most vital Meek Mill moment of this cycle comes on this freestyle, part of Funkmaster Flex's ongoing series. He begins with a stroke of comity, speaking about reconciling with Drake, and then exuberantly raps over ""Back to Back,"" the song Drake used to dismantle him so effectively three years ago: ""My old opps, they super mad, we left them pouring Henny up/'Cause they homies got whacked, we bought Maybachs/Came through they strip, no tint, laid back."" But it's later in the 10-minute performance that Meek Mill's talents truly shine through. He's become something of a cautionary tale, and he wants to warn others. For about five minutes, much of it aimed directly to the camera, he raps about the futility of the drug game, about the hopelessness that leads to poor decisions. ""They tried to bury us, ain't know that we was seeds/We had to trap, ain't get no toys on Christmas Eve/Play that corner made you rich, what we believed,"" he raps, with understanding and exhaustion. And then he goes on, telling people that there's another way. JON CARAMANICA

The sound is retro but the words are up-to-the-minute in ""Please Don't Call Me Crazy,"" by the Cactus Blossoms, who have the vocal harmonies, reverb guitars and rockabilly backbeat of the Everly Brothers but live in the present. Singing over echoey guitars and a few chords, they confront digital life as lived now: ""Computer in your pocket/Nobody has to know,"" they sing. ""What you want/not what you need."" PARELES

IFE is a Puerto Rican electronic group led by a high priest of the Afro-Caribbean religion of Santeria; a bembe is a drum-driven Santeria ritual. But ""The Tearer (Bembe)"" is far from folkloric. The steady but ever-varying beat mixes percussion, piano, synthesizer and quick hisses of white noise behind rapping, singing and, about halfway through, an Auto-Tuned woman's voice leading a traditional-sounding call-and-response. The song glances at current events as it praises Oya, ""she who tears,"" the Yoruba goddess of storms, winds and transformation; the video presents her Marvel Comics equivalent, Storm of the X-Men. But what makes the track compelling is the beat. PARELES

After the death of his wife, Iraida, Eddie Palmieri found himself revisiting the songs they had shared in their youth. Eventually, it led the Latin music eminence into his next project: ""Mi Luz Mayor,"" an agile record featuring big-band arrangements of old Afro-Caribbean dance numbers and boleros. At the center is Palmieri's scathing piano. On ""Quimbombo"" -- originally recorded by Willie Colon and Hector Lavoe -- the vocalist Herman Olivera volleys with his backing chorus in a gleeful paean to okra stew. The vocalists and orchestra offer a sunnier, smoother take than the original recording (closer to the Hermanos Moreno version), but Palmieri has another thing in mind. His piano teases against Olivera's vocals with subtle displacements until he finally breaks into a full-on solo, laying waste to the song's simple four-chord pattern.

Global Business,Safety Board Rules Out a Cause for 787 Battery Fire,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/business/global/ntsb-rules-out-a-cause-for-battery-fire-on-787-dreamliner.html,"Federal investigations said Sunday that they had ruled out excessive voltage as the cause of a battery fire on a Boeing 787 in Boston this month, widening the mystery into what led to the grounding of the world's most technologically advanced jet after a second battery-related problem last week.

With investigators focused on the plane's lithium-ion batteries, the National Transportation Safety Board said an examination of the data from the plane's flight recorder indicated that the battery ""did not exceed the designed voltage of 32 volts."" The fire aboard a Japan Airlines plane on Jan. 7 at Logan International Airport in Boston occurred after the passengers had gotten off.

Last week, a battery problem on another 787 forced an All Nippon Airways jetliner to make an emergency landing in Japan. That episode prompted aviation authorities around the world to ground the plane, also known as the Dreamliner. The Federal Aviation Administration said last week that it would not lift the ban until Boeing could show that the batteries were safe.

Food,The Kindest Cut of All: A Pork Rib With Slow-Cooked Comforts,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/dining/country-style-pork-ribs-recipes.html,"When it comes to pork, most home cooks know the chop, the tenderloin, the loin roast, even the Boston butt. But because I am a sucker for the underdog and the oddball, I have a new favorite cut of pork: the country-style rib. Why oddball? First, it suffers from something of an identity crisis, since despite its name it's not really a rib. Second, it has an indeterminate composition, consisting of both light and dark meat. Finally, it has a tendency to slide into disreputable territory, since its name is sometimes appropriated for less desirable cuts. But like any good antihero, the country-style rib has hidden virtues. It has rich, deep pork flavor; it is generally the most inexpensive cut of pork at the meat counter; and it is ideal for those slow-cooked dishes we crave in cool weather.

To understand this cut, you first need to know the blade pork chop. This chop is cut from the two ribs at the shoulder end of the pork loin. Because it comes from the intersection of the tender loin and the more fat-laden and gnarly shoulder, it has qualities of both.

Butchers used to have difficulty selling this chop, because it didn't look as lean and smooth as those from the center of the loin. So it generally ended up as an ingredient in sausages or, less reputably, secreted at the bottom of a wrapped package of ""loin chops."" Then sometime back in the late 1960s or early '70s, a Chicago-area butcher, Cliff Bowes, came up with the idea of taking advantage of the popularity of ribs by fashioning these lowly chops into strips that resembled ribs. To do so, he butterflied the chops and cut through the ribs. You can recognize these traditional country-style ribs by the slender section of rib that curves prettily along the bottom. I asked butchers in New York and Boston to cut me country-style ribs, and both did it this way. In a world in which everyone used the same words to mean the same thing, that would be the end of the story. But the approach of butchers tends to be more like that of Humpty Dumpty, who said in ""Through the Looking-Glass,"" ""When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean."" So it's not surprising that three other cuts are often marketed under this name.

Sometimes instead of a curving rib bone, you'll find a flat little two- or three-inch section of bone lurking along one edge of your country-style ribs. This means the chop was cut from the section of the shoulder just adjacent to the ribs; the bone is a piece of the scapula. But this is really not a big deal. Ribs fabricated in this fashion will have somewhat more fat and connective tissue and more dark meat, but are still close cousins of the more traditional cut, and cook up the same way. That's not the end of it, though. Some butchers will cut the lower part of the pork shoulder into strips and label them ""boneless country-style ribs."" They are still tasty and work well in long-cooking recipes, but you have to pay closer attention to what you're getting and avoid those with excess amounts of fat and gnarl. Then there's the higher-class impostor. Sometimes boneless rib-eye chops are fashioned into long, slender pieces and called country-style ribs. You can tell them clearly from their much lighter color and higher price -- usually twice as expensive as the real thing. But since this portion of the pig is much leaner and therefore cooks differently, we'll bypass these ersatz ribs for now. Any of the other versions, though, will work just fine, particularly in stews and braises. In addition to its proportion of lean meat to fat and collagen, the country-style rib also has a shape that makes it ideal for stews. It's hard to find pre-cut pork stew meat in the supermarket, and even if you do it's not a good idea to buy it, since it usually consists of ragged little odds and ends from around the pig.","Though mislabeled and misunderstood, the country-style rib has deep flavor, versatility and a friendly price.",0290d3b3-084d-56ec-aa63-634204f7ed93,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/03/dining/03COUNTRYRIBS/03COUNTRYRIBS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=8ac956f2eefff7cebf00b846c50c54d237f3ff88e9e745ddd1dcb60b637edb04&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"With its deep pork flavor, the country-style rib is ideal in slow-cooked winter dishes like this pork stew with pears and sweet potatoes.",0290d3b3-084d-56ec-aa63-634204f7ed93,N24News/imgs/0290d3b3-084d-56ec-aa63-634204f7ed93.jpg,17
Opinion,Trump's Taxes Were Not a Flaw in the System,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/opinion/trump-tax-code-reform.html,"When Americans recently learned how little President Trump has paid in taxes in the past 15 years and how he benefited from financial maneuvers, it reinforced the widespread belief that the rich don't pay their fair share. Lost in the outrage is the fact that the tax provisions that allowed Mr. Trump to trim his tax bill were probably not illegal or the results of tax schemes concocted by anti-tax legislators. Those provisions, and many others like them, delivered exactly what their drafters intended: They are engineered to benefit certain kinds of taxpayers -- and most Americans are not among them. There are many aspirational visions for the tax code. If yours is a wildly complex, 2,600-page code of rules and frustration, you win, because that's what we have now. If you desire a federal tax code that's an archaeological record of special-interest politics, chiseled out over time with giveaways under the cover of achieving social goals like subsidized child care, homeownership, health care, higher education and more, you win again. But if your vision is for a more equitable system that can actually be enforced by the I.R.S., what we really need is a simpler and fairer tax code. Some of the current rules are good, but many are political giveaways to special interests. Telling those rules apart is actually harder than it seems, but there are some obvious places to start.

The beneficiaries of the tax code's complexity are the well-to-do and well-connected individuals and corporations who work hard to create and expand loopholes -- and can afford accountants who can take advantage of the intricacies. Politicians, rewarded with campaign contributions, are clear beneficiaries, too. This results in hundreds of tax credits, deductions and special tax rates, including those used by Mr. Trump.
* Mark Penn and Andrew Stein write that ""only a broader course correction to the center will give Democrats a fighting chance in 2022"" and beyond.
* Tory Gavito and Adam Jentleson write that the Virgina loss should ""shock Democrats into confronting the powerful role that racially coded attacks play in American politics.""
* Ezra Klein speaks to David Shor, who discusses his fear that Democrats face electoral catastrophe unless they shift their messaging.
* Ross Douthat writes that the outcome of the Virginia gubernatorial race shows Democrats need a ""new way to talk about progressive ideology and education."" The losers are most Americans, who have no clue what's in the tax code and collectively spend about eight billion hours a year complying with its filing requirements. A good place to start simplifying is to get rid of tax privileges granted to politically favored special interests. Listing all of them would be an impossible task, but there are candidates for elimination that enjoy at least some degree of bipartisan support. Since 1913, interest on municipal bonds issued by state and local governments has been exempt from federal income taxation. It is a favorite loophole for wealthy taxpayers, who invest in them. It is also a delight for Wall Street, which profits from all the municipal-bond issuing and trading. Getting rid of even one of these deductions is hard. The state and local tax deduction (or SALT) deduction benefits mostly high-income taxpayers. Even many Democrats, who are quick to complain about the rich not paying their fair share, fervently support it.

In a rare exception, the Republican tax reform act of 2017 capped the SALT deduction at $10,000 (previously, more than 88 percent of the benefit flowed to people with incomes in excess of $100,000). But the fight isn't over. Covid-19 relief bills adopted in the Democratic House include a temporary repeal of the $10,000 SALT cap; it was not the only recent attempt by Democrats to give a billion-dollar tax break to high-earning households -- Senator Chuck Schumer of New York was part of a similar effort earlier this year. (Negotiations over a new relief bill that may or may not take up the SALT deduction continue.) Yet calls to end all tax deductions, credits and exemptions can be problematic, too. In some cases, what look like ""giveaways"" to businesses -- like a loss carryback, which allows them to smooth out their tax bills over multiple years -- actually represent good policy. In Mr. Trump's case, the public doesn't know enough to judge whether he abused the exemption or is simply a terrible businessman. But we wouldn't want to tax a business that made a $1 million profit this year if it lost $1 million annually over the previous two years. Since it's still losing money overall, it should be able to average its profits. And we wouldn't want to tax entrepreneurs and start-ups at higher rates than we tax established businesses like Amazon and Walmart. The same is true for those who assume it is easy to know which business expenses are acceptable or objectionable. For instance, if the C.E.O. of a company flies to Paris for a meeting with clients on Friday but decides to stay the weekend as a tourist, it seems wrong for this person to deduct the cost of extra hotel nights. But what if the cost of staying the weekend is actually less than the cost of staying for just one night? Which one does the C.E.O. deduct? Or how should we distinguish the cost of hair and makeup for a TV show from the cost of a hair stylist for everyday life? No matter what the tax system is, as long as we tax businesses, figuring out what counts as a legitimate expense and what doesn't will often create challenges. Yes, there will be some abuses, but alternatives to this model are also bound to be disastrous. And the incentives to take advantage of preferences (and the incentives for lobbyists to create them) are higher when tax rates go up -- something that Joe Biden and his team may want to keep in mind if they're in charge next year.

My ideal tax code would eliminate the double taxation of income -- taxing the same dollar of income twice (or more). A typical example: taxing corporate income first through the corporate income tax and second through the individual income tax on dividends and capital gains. My tax code would restore ""horizontal equity,"" meaning that taxpayers making the same income pay the same amount of taxes. It would also broaden the tax base and lower rates. Many of these goals can be achieved by eliminating tax preferences that tilt the playing field in favor of politically connected interest groups. Finally, this tax code wouldn't be used to incentivize certain behaviors, which is a poor way to achieve these goals. If we want to encourage certain objectives, do it transparently through subsidies. The sad truth is that we'll never have an honest conversation about taxes as long as we don't recognize that the tax code is an imperfect product of politics and so must also be reformed through the political process.

Food,6 Steps to the Best Barbecued Ribs,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/dining/bbq-ribs-recipe.html,"Ribs -- which take a few hours to cook and just 30 minutes of prep work -- are eminently worth the effort.





Let Texans brag about brisket and Carolinians extol pulled pork shoulder. For the rest of us, the ultimate emblem of barbecue -- and test of a grill master's mettle -- is ribs. Picture meaty slabs stung with spice, bronzed with smoke and slathered with sticky sweet barbecue sauce. The meat is tender, but not too tender, with a profound pork flavor enhanced by the pit master's art. You may have thought such alchemy possible only at the best barbecue joints. But great ribs are surprisingly easy to make at home, which is good news at a time when eating out can be fraught. Ribs are barbecue at its most primal and unadorned; indeed, that's the crux of their appeal. It's conceivable that you might eat brisket with a knife and fork, or more likely between two slices of white bread. Pork shoulder comes either shredded or chopped, and you always eat it on a bun.

Ribs, on the other hand, demand to be devoured caveman-style, ripped apart with bare hands and gnawed right off the bone. I won't say that cooking them is quick -- if you want speed, grill a steak. But if ribs take two to three hours in all, the actual prep can be done in 30 minutes. True, the process as I've laid it out here requires a homemade spice rub and barbecue sauce, and turning your grill into a smoker. But the results are achievable by all, and eminently worth the effort. Just follow these six steps, and the recipe I've provided. No special equipment is needed beyond the grill you probably already have in your backyard.

One of the secrets of great ribs -- indeed, great barbecue in general -- is a process that creates layers of flavors. I start with a slather, like Dijon mustard, that I brush on both sides of each rack of ribs. Next, I apply a rub -- in the recipe here, a fragrant amalgam of chile powder, brown sugar, salt and pepper, with celery seed added for spice. The third layer comes from apple cider, which you spritz on halfway through cooking. (This also helps keep the ribs moist.) The fourth layer -- the varnish, as it were -- takes the form of a chipotle bourbon barbecue sauce, which you sear into the meat over a hot fire, creating a glossy finish. The crowning touch is a light, fresh sprinkle of rub added right before serving the ribs to bring attention back to the spice.

Most professional pit masters cook ribs low and slow in a smoker. You're going to use a hotter and faster method called indirect grilling. In short, you cook the ribs next to, not directly over, the fire, with the grill lid closed and hardwood added to produce wood smoke. To set up a charcoal grill for indirect grilling, light the coals, then pour or rake them into two mounds at opposite sides of the grill. Place a foil pan in the center to catch the dripping rib fat. The ribs go onto the grate over this drip pan, away from the heat. To set up a two-burner gas grill for indirect grilling, light one side and cook the ribs on the unlit side. On a three-burner gas grill, light the outside or front and rear burners, and cook the ribs over the unlit burner in the center. On a four- to six-burner gas grill, light the outside burners and, again, cook the ribs in the center. On a kamado-style grill, insert the heat diffuser, a ceramic plate that separates the food from the fire. Pellet grills, by their very design, grill indirectly, so no special setup is needed. Note that with all these types of grills, the lid must be closed.

Wood smoke has been called the umami of barbecue. It is certainly barbecue's soul. While you can make delectable baby back ribs without wood smoke, as the French and Brazilians do, they won't taste like American barbecue. So which wood to use? Debate rages in barbecue circles over the superiority of apple versus cherry, hickory versus mesquite, or whether to employ a combination of several woods. Mesquite lends the strongest flavor, but any hardwood chunk or chip will deliver the requisite smokiness. I smoked the ribs in my recipe with cherry wood, simply because I had it on hand. To smoke ribs on a charcoal grill, add hardwood chunks or soaked, drained hardwood chips to the embers. (Soaking helps slow the rate of combustion, so the chips smolder and smoke before they catch fire.) In a kamado, intersperse the chunks or chips with the charcoal. A pellet grill has the wood, and smoke, built into the pellets. (Note: On a pellet grill you get more smoke flavor at lower temperatures, so lengthen the cooking time accordingly.) It's harder, but not impossible, to smoke on a gas grill. If your grill has a smoker box with a dedicated burner, add chunks or chips there. If not, place a few hardwood chunks under the grate, directly over the burners. Or make smoking pouches: Wrap soaked, drained wood chips in heavy-duty foil to form a flat pillow shape. Poke holes at one-inch intervals in the top with the tip of a meat thermometer, to release the smoke. Position the resulting pouches (two for the ribs here) under the grate, directly over the burners. Run the grill on high until you see smoke, then dial the temperature back to 300 degrees. What about smoking ribs indoors? Desperate times like these call for desperate measures. I know it smacks of heresy, but you can achieve a reasonable approximation of barbecued ribs in the oven. Cook them on a rack in a roasting pan at 300 degrees. To add a smoke flavor, mix one-half teaspoon liquid smoke with four tablespoons melted butter, and brush this mixture on both sides of the ribs a few times during the last hour of cooking.

While barbecue sauce isn't mandatory, for most Americans, ribs just don't taste complete without it. This version calls for one of my favorites -- a sweet, smoky blend of molasses, brown sugar and ketchup, with bourbon for kick and chipotle chiles to crank up the heat. Here, too, the sauce goes on in layers -- first brushed on and roasted into the ribs during the last 20 minutes of cooking, then applied again and seared into the meat over high heat, and finally served with the ribs for spooning or dipping. A crucial factor is the sizzle, which involves directly grilling the ribs (move them right over the fire or lit burners) for the final four minutes or so -- long enough to caramelize the brown sugar and molasses, and sear the sauce into the meat. Take care to avoid the cardinal sin of applying the sauce too early, when the ribs first go on the grill. That's what grown-ups did when I was young, and the sugar in the sauce invariably burned long before the meat was cooked. For many years, I thought barbecue was supposed to taste burned. 6. Know when your ribs are done.

Pork ribs come with their own version of the pop-up thermometer that signals that a turkey is done: The meat shrinks back from the ends of the bones. When you see a quarter- to a half-inch of clean bone at the end of each rib, it is ready. You should be able to pull the individual ribs apart with your fingers. The meat should resist, but just a little. Many Americans are accustomed to meat that falls off the bones -- a style that may have begun with the doleful practice of boiling or steaming ribs before grilling. The notion of soft (dare I say mushy?) ribs took root in our collective culinary consciousness. Root out that idea now. Yes, ribs should be tender, but they should definitely retain a little chew. That's why we have teeth.","A backyard grill can easily produce the spicy, smoky slabs that for many are barbecue's ultimate prize.",9b56f2f4-47b6-55de-9c03-fff3d0fdf99b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/29/dining/29Ribs4/29Ribs4-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=98443b3ac7b0ec1b788c136a38c284073408af37ec3c48696546ca0767f8b8a3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Indirect heat keeps the ribs from overcooking.,9b56f2f4-47b6-55de-9c03-fff3d0fdf99b,N24News/imgs/9b56f2f4-47b6-55de-9c03-fff3d0fdf99b.jpg,17

Travel,TripAdvisor Ends Ticket Sales to Attractions That Breed or Buy Dolphins and Whales,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/travel/tripadvisor-dolphins-whales.html,"TripAdvisor will no longer sell tickets to attractions that breed, import or capture whales, dolphins, porpoises and other cetaceans for public display, the company announced on Wednesday. The move will ban sales to attractions and events at parks and aquariums worldwide, including SeaWorld, which has locations in Florida, Texas and California, Loro Parque in Spain and the Georgia Aquarium. The policy is the latest addition to TripAdvisor's 2016 animal welfare policy, which ended sales of tickets to experiences where travelers have physical contact with captive wild animals, such as elephant riding and tiger petting. The policy, which includes the TripAdvisor subsidiary, Viator , comes a year after the company banned sales of tickets to performances and shows considered demeaning to animals, and it comes as concerns increase over animal tourism and animal welfare.

""Whales and dolphins do not thrive in limited captive environments, and we hope to see a future where they live as they should -- free and in the wild,"" said Dermot Halpin, TripAdvisor's president for experiences and rentals. ""We believe the current generation of whales and dolphins in captivity should be the last, and we look forward to seeing this position adopted more widely throughout the travel industry.""

The new rules focus on future generations of marine mammals because releasing those already in captivity would further endanger them, the company said. The new policy also focuses on improving the lives of the animals already in captivity. In order to be eligible for ticket sales on the platform, attractions must have a permanent seaside living environment. The company will also continue to sell tickets for commercial and nonprofit organizations that are developing alternate seaside sanctuaries for cetaceans in captivity, and have made a public commitment to rehouse them these environments. That could mean bays or coves that are close environments where cetaceans are found naturally. Animal conservation and protection groups lauded the move as a step in the right direction. ""This sends a clear message to other travel companies that we must end this cruel industry once and for all,"" said Nick Stewart, global head of wildlife and dolphins for World Animal Protection, an activist group. ""Together we can ensure this is the last generation of dolphins held captive for entertainment.""

In an email, SeaWorld's chief zoological officer, Chris Dold, said he was ""disappointed"" with TripAdvisor's policy. SeaWorld has long faced criticism of its marine-mammal shows, and faced heavy condemnation after the 2013 release of ""Blackfish,"" a documentary about its treatment of orcas. ""We are disappointed by TripAdvisor's new position that ignores the educational value and conservation mission of professionally accredited zoos and aquariums,"" he said. ""SeaWorld maintains the highest standards of care for all animals, including cetaceans. And regardless of TripAdvisor's position, SeaWorld will continue to advance education and animal conservation efforts."" 52 PLACES AND MUCH, MUCH MORE Follow our 52 Places traveler, Sebastian Modak, on Instagram as he travels the world, and discover more Travel coverage by following us on Twitter and Facebook.

Travel,"In Haiti, Tracing a Paradise Lost",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/travel/in-haiti-tourism-economy-caribbean.html,"Haiti is a fixture in my mind, as permanent as memories of high school graduation or the weekend I first met my wife. I lived there twice as an American diplomat for a total of four years since 2000, but its hold on me is not a function of time. Of all the countries I lived and worked in, Haiti stood out as the most beautiful, the most colorful and the poorest. It melds French, African and Caribbean cultures into something truly unique, less than two hours from Miami. Yet it also resists easy definition. It is an open, free place filled with secrets. Today there are conflicting signs about where Haiti is going. The U.N. Security Council decided recently to close down the peacekeeping mission it has maintained in Haiti since 2004. The U.N. Secretary-General's final report on the mission concluded: ""The many setbacks and challenges notwithstanding, including the disaster caused by the January 2010 earthquake and at least six major hurricanes, substantial headway was made, and today the Haitian people enjoy a considerable degree of security and greater stability.""

It has been several generations since Haiti was a major tourist destination, but it may become one again. International hotel chains have arrived, and the number of flights to the country has increased substantially. For years, American Airlines was the only U.S. carrier flying in or out but now JetBlue, Spirit and Delta also serve Port-au-Prince, and American has begun a daily flight to Cap Haitien. When I arrived this fall, my friend Pierre Esperance picked me up at the Port-au-Prince airport. I've known Pierre since 2000, a year after he was attacked and almost assassinated due to his occupation as Haiti's most prominent human rights activist. Despite the attack and other threats, he's still in the same line of work. Pierre is optimistic, even ebullient, yet also a cleareyed observer of Haiti's dysfunction. That evening, when I asked him to assess the country's current situation, his amiable disposition shifted to neutral. Haiti was in an uncertain place, he said, facing a mix of progress and setbacks. Road infrastructure had improved, as had the police, but Haiti's institutions were much too weak and the political will to support them did not exist. The justice and prison sectors were particularly problematic. We chatted on his terrace, filled with pink, white, red, and orange bougainvillea, and waited for the electricity to come on. Pierre's house gets power only a few hours every day, and he is one of the lucky ones. It is a stark reminder that in some ways Haiti has progressed very little. Pierre was born on nearby Gonave Island, and grew up without any electricity during the dictatorship of Jean-Claude Duvalier. Near the end of our evening together, I asked Pierre to compare that dictatorship to the current moment. He laughed and looked surprised. ""It's night and day,"" he said. ""Because today we have liberty of expression. Under Duvalier's regime, you could not come here to sit and talk, because there'd be people listening to us and they'd come to arrest us. But today you can walk down the street and speak however you want.""

The area improved since I last lived there, with recently paved streets and some new construction. The camps for earthquake victims, which used to cover every open space, were gone. Despite these improvements, though, it was clear that Port-au-Prince was not going to be a tourism hot spot for a long time to come. It is too difficult to move around, and security concerns dominate. If tourism ever returns to Haiti in a meaningful way, it will likely happen first in the provinces. For a road trip into the Haiti that exists outside of its capital, I turned to the driver I trust most in the world, Frantz Newbold. I met him in 2000, when he had started work as a driver for the U.S. Embassy, and I had just arrived for a two-year assignment. Frantz, the photographer Chris Miller and I started our road trip by heading south toward Saint Louis du Sud, a town on Haiti's southern coast. Inspired by the Bradt Haiti guide, I was looking for old forts. We found the first one, Fort Olivier, on the edge of a promontory near town, in a pleasant open area dotted with palm trees. By itself, it would be a worthy stop on any tourist excursion. The real masterpiece, though, was Fort Anglais, which occupied an entire island just offshore. We bargained with local fishermen to take us there, and climbed into their rickety dugout canoe, literally a floating mango tree trunk with its insides scooped out. It was brightly painted in the red and blue of the Haitian flag. Chris and I spent hours clambering through the fort, which was thickly covered in underbrush, banyan trees and guarded by suspicious goats. Built by the French in 1702, Fort Anglais was a spectacular find, the type of place that if properly restored, would undoubtedly be a top destination. There was even the beginning of tourist infrastructure, in the form of two concrete piers built to connect Fort Anglais to the mainland. For the time being, though, it sat in the middle of a gorgeous, white sand-lined Caribbean bay, largely ignored. While clawing through the fort's underbrush, I suddenly came upon a thick drapery of banyan roots covering the entrance to an intact room. Blue-tailed lizards congregated on the roots and I spent a few minutes just looking at them. When I finally pushed into the room, I discovered an alcove on the far side. Using my phone's flashlight, I realized that the alcove was actually a tunnel leading down and to the left. For a moment, I was an excited child. I climbed into the alcove and started down the tunnel.

I crept forward but the walls narrowed and the remaining space filled with even more insects. I held the flashlight out and saw the passageway curve down into another room. I wanted so badly to go, but I could almost feel the spider-crickets dropping onto my neck and crawling under my T-shirt. In the battle between exciting adventure and large, noisy insects, the insects won. I retreated back into the sun. To erase my skin's memory of this encounter, I walked to the sea-facing side of the island and found a spit of perfectly white sand. Remains of the fort's exterior walls stuck out of the ankle-high water, which was warm and crystal-clear. The beach was perfect, or at least it would be once the washed-up plastic bottles were removed. I snorkeled for a half-hour, finding coral and small fish, and glancing back now and then at the fort. This was an ideal area for tourism: perfect sand, warm water, and a massive, mysterious fort evoking pirates and buried treasure. Its future, however, was as uncertain as Haiti's. We continued exploring Haiti over the next two days as we raced across the southern coast. We found time to root around one of the many caves scattered throughout the mountainous country. Most have a cultural and historical resonance. Taino Indians, the first inhabitants in Haiti, as well as runaway slaves, used the caves to hide from their oppressors. Haiti's best known cave and one of its largest is Grotte Marie Jeanne. It has several levels, and certain areas remain unexplored. Guides from the nearby town of Port-a-Piment take visitors into deep areas, but many easily accessible caverns are on the surface. While clambering around one of them, we came across an underground chamber dotted with bottles of Barbancourt rum. Apparently, the cave is still used. We also stopped by the town of Jacmel, one of Haiti's top tourist destinations, mainly for the festivities and parades that culminate with the Feb. 4 carnival. Jacmel's walkable downtown is filled with buildings that evoke its 19th- and 20th-century role as a commercial and shipping hub.

The minister of tourism envisions Jacmel becoming a cruise ship stop too. It isn't hard to imagine the old pretty streets downtown and along the seaside boardwalk filled with tourists. Although some buildings in this historic commercial and shipping hub required work, some appeared to need nothing more than a coat of paint. Jacmel was an alluring a mix of history, culture, beaches and beauty. Nearby, it even boasts Haiti's first and only surf club. Surf Haiti is several miles outside of Jacmel, in the commune of Cayes-Jacmel. The thatched roof, beachfront restaurant called Le Cam's, where I met members of Surf Haiti, looked the part of a surfing hub. I was there to meet Lionel Andre Pierre, born in New York to Haitian parents. When he and his family moved to Jacmel several years ago, he fell in with the tiny surfing community that had started because of the presence of several international aid workers with a passion for surfing. The workers found local children already ""surfing on driftwood and plywood,"" he said. They gave the children surfing instruction and organized them, which led to the creation of Surf Haiti. Today, Surf Haiti is the country's only member of the International Surf Association, which functions as surfing's governing body. Some in Surf Haiti dream of competing in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, when surfing will make its debut as an Olympic sport. For the time being, though, the group is focused on more prosaic opportunities. Members teach surf and swimming lessons, and also run an eco guesthouse nearby. Surf Haiti gets about 5 to 10 requests for lessons a month, a small number but enough to imagine what larger-scale tourism could bring. An hourlong surf lesson costs between 8 and 15 US dollars, much more than Haiti's daily minimum wage of 290 gourdes ($4.55) for eight hours of work in hotels, restaurants and agriculture. Also soaking in Le Cam's relaxed Sunday atmosphere was Ericka Bourraine, director of the Ministry of Tourism in the Southeast Department. Like Lionel, Bourraine was born in the United States to Haitian parents and decided to return to Haiti in recent years. Her office supports major events each trimester, including a summer surfing and music festival in collaboration with Surf Haiti. She also is encouraging the development of excursions, like a day trip along the ""route du cafe"" to show how Haitian coffee is grown, harvested and prepared. Ms. Bourraine said the goal is to provide vacation options to potential tourists like the Haitian diaspora, although some fear their country's insecurity. Bourraine said she had heard those in the generation before her say, ""I'll never step foot in Haiti again. I'll never go back to that place."" However, Ms. Bourraine said the generation after that is very interested in seeing the country. ""It's just about making the connections and making those people feel safe and feel brave enough to venture out,"" she said.

There was no electricity, so I took a shower in darkening shadow. When I walked onto the hotel's veranda, the abundant tropical flowers glowed in the last rays of sun. WE SET OFF on an epic drive the next day from Cayes-Jacmel on the southern coast to Cap-Haitian on the northern coast. The distance is relatively modest in absolute terms, about 193 miles. That this journey seems so intimidating is due to two factors --- Haiti's mountainous interior and the lack of any bypass to avoid Port-au-Prince. It ended up taking over 10 hours, through the mountains along the southern coast, down into the broad plain of Port-au-Prince, then due north until we climbed into the mountains of Haiti's northern claw. We passed through forest stippled with thousands of shades of green. Thick clouds swirled around the car and hugged the road. At times the roads were wide and recently paved, the rust-red earth neatly graded and stacked on each side. In other moments, I gripped the dashboard with white knuckles. Weaving through Port-au-Prince, we took rutted gravel roads to avoid a demonstration. When we finally arrived in Cap Haitien, Frantz drove through torrential rain that poured across the streets and disabled several trucks. This was Haiti from south to north, its problems and promise on clear display. That evening, we unwound on the veranda of Cormier Plage, a beach hotel I had visited during my first assignment to the country. It is tucked between Cap Haitien and Labadee, a private beach resort closed-off peninsula leased by Royal Caribbean as a day stop for many of its cruise ships. At dinner, we sat in comfortable lounge chairs and listened to waves breaking on the beach only feet away. It was so dark that the lights above us shone like beacons. In the aftermath of that day's drive, I felt optimistic and wondered out loud whether Haiti had turned a corner.

Only skeletal walls remain of Sans Souci Palace, which was severely damaged by an earthquake in 1842. However, the Citadel still looks every bit as impressive as the statistics cited about it --- largest fortress in the Western Hemisphere, filled with original, French, English and Haitian built cannons, walls 13 feet thick and 131 feet tall. It took 20,000 people 14 years to build it. This complex has been a tourist attraction for a long time. In 1937, The New York Times announced a new steamship service that would make the Citadel more accessible. ""The main offering of the new tourist service is the chance of visiting the famous citadel, La Ferriere, sometimes rated among the ten wonders of the world."" My tour guide was Nicolas Antoine, a 62-year-old who has been showing people around the complex for 25 years. When he began, Antoine said, the Citadel was in poor shape, abandoned, with trees growing on and inside its walls. The task of ferrying up tourists was given to sure-footed donkeys climbing through scrub. His description reminded me of the current condition of Fort Anglais on the southern coast, another impressive site in a country filled with them. The complex was truly spectacular, a testament to Haiti's world-changing struggle for independence. When we arrived, it was late morning, blindingly hot and humid. I stepped across a crumbling wall of Sans Souci Palace into a field of tall grass. Chattering from the village of Milot below rose through the air. Facing me, on the other side of the village, was a steep mountain slope covered with rubber, mahogany, mango and palm trees. I greedily drank in the view. Haiti's struggle with deforestation is well known, making these types of unadulterated visions of nature all the more precious.

Turning in the other direction, I noticed a young man sitting nearby, intently staring at a piece of paper, his lips moving as if in prayer. I asked him what he was doing. He was studying for an economics test. In the distance stood a large school building, and I heard the chant of students repeating lessons. This moment occupied my thoughts on the climb up to the Citadel and while walking through the fortress's cool, mist-wreathed corridors. Finally, I realized why it resonated so strongly. I had witnessed a normal Tuesday morning: school, studying for a test, daily chatter, guides, shopkeepers looking for tourists, and tourists looking at the sights. It could have been any tourist destination anywhere in the world. But this time, it was in Haiti. Like many who have filtered through the country, I held memories of Haiti that were complicated, any happiness diluted by the things I lived through. But near the end of my road trip, in a grassy field alongside Sans Souci Palace, the power of these memories receded a bit. A new narrative began, in which it wasn't brave or unusual to see Haiti's sights, to eat its food, to interact with the people I came across, and to be a tourist. It was normal. At the Cap Haitien airport the next day, the waiting area was new and well maintained. As I waited for the flight, I thought about the last moments of our road trip and about saying goodbye to Frantz. We had stood in the airport parking lot under the shade of a big yellow school bus and ate lunch his mother had prepared for us --- Creole sauce, pan-fried fish, pickled vegetables, and Haitian rice. It was so delicious that I can still taste it. When we were done, he drove me to the departure area. I gave Frantz a picture I had recently come across. It was the two of us 17 years ago, on one of our first road trips through the country. Saying goodbye felt like the end of an era, one that expressed itself through silence rather than words. In the airport waiting area, the lights flickered and went out. The fast descending tropical sun threw broad shadows across the walls, but unlike past moments, I did not assume the worst. I figured the lights would come back on, and soon they did.","The U.N. says the country is now stable, and tourism is growing.

Media,Martin Sorrell Beats WPP in Bidding War for Dutch Marketing Firm,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/10/business/media/martin-sorrell-mediamonks-wpp.html,"Martin Sorrell, the former chief executive of the advertising giant WPP who is now trying to build a new ad company, beat out his former employer for the purchase of a Dutch marketing firm on Tuesday, a move that WPP claimed could endanger millions of dollars in his stock awards.

Mr. Sorrell's new firm, S4 Capital, said in a statement that it had bought MediaMonks, which has 11 offices and more than 750 employees. The marketing firm brings in about 110 million euros ($129 million) of annual revenue, and buying it is S4 Capital's first move in creating ""a new era, new media solution embracing data, content and technology,"" the statement said.

The purchase price was EUR300 million, or about $352 million, and will be paid in cash and stock, according to a person familiar with the deal who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss specific details.

The acquisition was contentious because WPP, which ousted Mr. Sorrell in April, was also bidding for MediaMonks. Last week, lawyers for WPP sent Mr. Sorrell, 73, a letter saying that he was risking his future stock awards, worth millions of dollars, by aiming to buy the firm.","Mr. Sorrell and his new firm, S4 Capital, beat out the advertising giant, his former company, for the purchase of MediaMonks.",3ac71bbb-6d5c-5b12-a319-fc0411c38928,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/11/business/11sorrell1/11sorrell1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=b56ebca834ca76a3a06a57388684e2ed29e27f48e6c012e9fd3b7b8eb751e2de&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Martin Sorrell's new firm said Tuesday that it had bought MediaMonks, which has more than 750 employees, three months after he stepped down as chief executive of WPP.",3ac71bbb-6d5c-5b12-a319-fc0411c38928,N24News/imgs/3ac71bbb-6d5c-5b12-a319-fc0411c38928.jpg,16
Science,"Lab Severs Ties With James Watson, Citing 'Unsubstantiated and Reckless' Remarks",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/science/watson-dna-genetics.html,"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory revoked the honorary titles held by its longtime leader James D. Watson on Friday, describing as ""unsubstantiated and reckless"" his recent remarks about genetic differences in intelligence among racial groups.

Dr. Watson, one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century, had apologized after making similar comments to a British newspaper in 2007. At the time, he was forced to retire from his job as chancellor at Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island, but he has retained his office there, as well as the titles of chancellor emeritus, Oliver R. Grace professor emeritus and honorary trustee. The graduate school of biological sciences at the research center is named for Dr. Watson, and the laboratory held a 90th birthday party for him last spring.

For the past decade the laboratory, like much of the scientific community, has engaged in a delicate balancing act with regard to Dr. Watson: holding him at arm's length for reinforcing unfounded racial stereotypes, while still honoring him for his contributions to science. Dr. Watson, with Francis Crick and Rosalind Franklin, helped discover the double-helix structure of DNA in 1953, and he went on to help to shape the subsequent revolution in molecular biology.

Economy,"California Rent Control Bill Advances, Fueled by Housing Crisis",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/business/economy/california-rent-control.html,"California's escalating housing costs have yielded epic commutes and a rising tide of homelessness. Now they are close to producing a political milestone: a vast expansion of tenant-protection laws that would cap rents statewide. On Tuesday, the State Senate voted to advance a bill to limit rent increases to 5 percent a year plus a cost-of-living adjustment. The State Assembly, the Legislature's lower house, could give final approval as early as Wednesday, though passage is uncertain. The legislation is the latest in a series of measures that have swept through state and local governments this year to regulate rents and strengthen tenant rights. For decades, such provisions have been mostly limited to a relative handful of apartments in the nation's big cities. ""Passing tenant legislation in Sacramento is incredibly difficult,"" said Assemblyman David Chiu, a San Francisco Democrat who is the bill's author. ""But we're in the midst of the worst housing crisis in our state's history, and I think my colleagues and policymakers understand we have to do something differently.""

All this has opened the door for rent control, historically a lost cause in Sacramento but a legislative priority of Gov. Gavin Newsom in his first year in office. Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, was previously mayor of San Francisco, where the housing pinch has been particularly acute. The bill is technically an anti-gouging measure that borrows language from the typically short-term price caps imposed after disasters like fires and floods. It would extend price protections to an estimated eight million tenants, though only a small fraction now face annual rent increases in excess of the bill's limit. [Read more: How older tenants on fixed incomes could remain vulnerable, even with rent caps.] ""California is at the doorstep of enacting strong, statewide renter protections -- safeguards that are critical to combating our state's housing and cost-of-living crisis,"" Mr. Newsom said after the Senate vote.

Normally a leader in progressive politics, California is something of a follower in this case. Earlier this year, Oregon limited rent increases for most tenants to 7 percent annually plus inflation. In New York, state lawmakers significantly strengthened regulations that dictate the rents of almost half of New York City's rental stock and allowed other cities to impose their own rent caps. Most states have laws that explicitly ban rent control, a century-old mechanism that has divided tenant activists, who argue that it is the most cost-effective way to quickly curb housing costs, and economists, who largely agree that it constrains the long-term housing supply. Only four states -- California, Maryland, New Jersey and New York -- have localities with rent control, along with Washington, D.C. But the idea of rent control is gaining steam, fueled by a far-reaching network of tenant unions and others organizing efforts to combat displacement and skyrocketing rents.

Washington, Colorado, Illinois and Florida are among the growing number of states where lawmakers are considering rent-control legislation.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""It's a way to confront the gentrification seeping across the country,"" said Kamau Walton, a national organizer at the Right to the City Alliance, a national coalition that supports universal rent control. ""Even in smaller towns, gentrification is definitely becoming an issue. And rent control is one of the ways people are pushing back."" California legislators have considered many bills in recent years to tackle the housing crisis, to little effect. A measure making it easier to build multiple-unit housing near transit was shelved in its final committee hearing this year, while a handful of tenant-friendly bills were similarly waylaid. Mr. Chiu's bill was the lone survivor, and backers have called its main provision a ""rent cap"" in hopes of improving its prospects and distinguishing it from more restrictive varieties of rent control.

Rent control, in some form, has long existed in several California cities, including Los Angeles and San Francisco. But under a 1995 state law, local governments have been prohibited from regulating the rent on vacant units, single-family homes and apartments built after that year. Tenants' rights groups have been pushing city-by-city ballot initiatives to extend rent control on pre-1995 housing. Those efforts have had mixed success, facing well-financed opposition from the California Apartment Association, which represents landlords. Mr. Chiu's bill aims to sidestep the 1995 law, which restricts only local governments, and apply rent regulations statewide. The bill exempts dwellings built within the last 15 years, but on a rolling basis, steadily expanding the price-regulated housing stock while providing an incentive for new construction.

In its initial draft, the bill covered every rental unit in the state, apartments and single-family homes alike. Then it was winnowed to a proposal that exempted most single-family homes and expired in three years. The rent cap was set at 7 percent plus inflation. But after leaving the Assembly, the bill was beefed up, requiring landlords to cite ""just cause"" for any eviction. And Mr. Newsom got involved, brokering a deal in which the rent cap was lowered to 5 percent after inflation and its term expanded to a decade. Landlords' groups were initially the bill's fiercest opponents but are now neutral, while the California Association of Realtors, whose support helped get the bill out of the Assembly, is fighting the latest version.",Millions of tenants would be covered by a measure championed by Gov.

Fashion & Style,There's Not That Much Fashion in FX's Big Versace Drama,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/fashion/versace-american-crime-story-fashion.html,"A highly anticipated follow-up to the ""The People vs. O.J. Simpson"" focuses on life in and out of the closet -- not as a shopper, but as a gay man.

LOS ANGELES -- Has fashion's big moment on television finally arrived with the docudrama ""The Assassination of Gianni Versace,"" the long-awaited installment of ""American Crime Story"" that begins airing on Wednesday on FX? This show centers not on Mr. Versace, the storied Italian designer fatally shot on his doorstep in Miami at age 50 on July 15, 1997, but on his killer, Andrew Cunanan, whose three-month murder spree culminated in his suicide at 27 a week later, leaving any motive a mystery. Mr. Versace doesn't even appear in some episodes. Much of the season is told backward, beginning with the murder, and then working through Mr. Cunanan's origin story, going back to his childhood. It's grittier and bloodier than its predecessor, ""The People vs. O.J. Simpson,"" which skipped the two gruesome murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman and focused instead on the madcap trial that followed, setting ratings records for FX and winning Emmys and Golden Globes aplenty. ""We knew we didn't want to do 'O.J.'-lite,"" said Brad Simpson, an executive producer of the series. ""We didn't want to have the exact same tone or vibe because we felt like that's something we couldn't match. This is much more about crime.""

""'O.J.' was very frenetic,"" said Ryan Murphy, another executive producer. ""'Versace' is lot slower and grander in its compositions. That's one of the turn-ons of the show for me. Every season, we're going to take on a crime, we're going to look at broader social issues, and every season will have a different tone."" This one is two-toned. There is the color of Mr. Versace (Edgar Ramirez), whose over-the-top sensibility brought celebrities to the front row, and who helped nurture his younger sister, Donatella (Penelope Cruz), into a star in her own right. In the series, life is getting better for Mr. Versace before his death: His fashion house is about to go public; he is out and proud, rare for high-profile gay men at the time; and though he is H.I.V. positive, new medication is making him stronger. Then there is the darkness of Mr. Cunanan (Darren Criss), who had a taste for the high life but appears to have made few earnest efforts to get there. The series focuses on his hideous unraveling from social climber to killer. In all, he murdered five people, including two friends, and at least three, and possibly four, gay men.

Regardless of its genre, ratings estimates indicate that roughly half the audience that tuned into ""The People vs. O.J. Simpson"" will not return for this season, said John Landgraf, the chief executive of FX, and he's just fine with that. ""We've made a show that by definition that a gay man that's lived through this experience is going to have a richer, deeper connection to this material than a straight guy who lived through that period of time,"" Mr. Landgraf said. ""That's probably not the most commercial choice you could make in America, but the way you get to great television is to ask people to go into experiences that are compelling but that are challenging."" Such experimentation makes FX an appealing line item on the slate of properties that the Walt Disney Company is looking to buy from 21st Century Fox, in a deal that will depend on regulatory approval. Mr. Murphy, a hitmaker whose contract expires later this year, has said he is not sure if he will stay with Fox after the Disney sale. He said he was inspired to do the show because he was living in Los Angeles at the time and gay men in all major national metropolises were transfixed by the story, and terrified Mr. Cunanan would be arriving in their city next. But when Mr. Murphy proposed a season about Mr. Cunanan three years ago -- well before the Simpson series debuted -- it gave his colleagues pause. Nina Jacobson, a producer of the series, politely nodded along before she went home to Google the killer. ""I was pretty much in the dark,"" she said. Brad Simpson, another producer, had a dim memory, too, and wondered if there was ""enough meat on the bone.""

Compared with the abundance of coverage around the O.J. Simpson case (tons of books, boundless archives of material), the public's fascination with Mr. Cunanan's murder spree was faded like a pair of acid-washed jeans. But the producers saw bigger themes in Ms. Orth's book. If Mr. Simpson's trial touched on racism and sexism, the Cunanan tale connected to something else: the shame of the closet, the remarkable difficulty of being openly gay in the 1990s. ""'American Crime Story' at its core only works if you're telling a bigger story about a societal ill,"" Mr. Murphy said. ""So I thought, 'Can we do something on homophobia in the '90s and the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policies at the time that I think and ruined so many lives?' And it's more topical than ever now with this president who is all about discrimination and exclusion.""

Mr. Martin said that his performance was informed by two things: just how much better it is to be proudly out now, and the embarrassment that he felt considering how he treated his former partners while he kept his sexuality secret. ""I went back to my life and what my life was in the '90s: big closet,"" he said. ""I made my lovers be like Antonio where he was kept in the shadows and kept in the dark back in the '90s. It took me back to a place, where, see, it was not necessary. I go back to Harvey Milk where he said everyone has to come out and we have to normalize this. So for me, I was playing both roles. I was playing the man coming out and the relief of it, and the lover, the victim."" It wasn't hard for Mr. Murphy to secure Mr. Martin's participation. ""I used to live in Miami when the actual crime happened,"" Mr. Martin said. ""Although I never met Gianni personally, I was invited to that house many, many times. And for some reason I never went. I had a Giorgio Armani campaign back in the day, so I'm sure that didn't help!"" Never one to miss a red-carpet opportunity, the house of Armani last week blasted out a news release announcing that it had dressed Mr. Martin, Mr. Criss and Finn Wittrock, the actor who plays one of the Cunanan victims, for the Los Angeles premiere of ""The Assassination of Gianni Versace.""","A highly anticipated follow-up to the ""The People vs. O.J.

The subtitle is no overstatement: In the early 1920s, first in Paris and then back home in Sao Paulo, Brazil, this painter really did lay the groundwork for the coming of modernism in Latin America's most populous nation. Tired of the European pretenders in Brazil's art academies, Tarsila (who was always called by her first name) began to intermingle Western, African and indigenous motifs into flowing, biomorphic paintings, and to theorize a new national culture fueled by the principle of antropofagia, or ""cannibalism."" Along with spare, assured drawings of Rio and the Brazilian countryside, this belated but very welcome show assembles Tarsila's three most important paintings, including the classic ""Abaporu"" (1928): a semi-human nude with a spindly nose and a comically swollen foot.

This small, hyper-specialized, stunning exhibition brings together a grand total of only 13 works -- a dozen shadow boxes by Joseph Cornell, the Queens-based assemblage artist, and the Cubist masterwork that he cited as their direct inspiration, Gris's ""Man at the Cafe"" (1914). It might seem like a surprising obsession for Cornell, who was not a painter nor a Frenchman. He and Gris never met. But Cornell was deeply moved by Gris, the overlooked, tag-along third wheel in the Cubist movement that also included Picasso and Braque, and the show succeeds in tracking the fluttery ways of artistic inspiration.

Mount Kumgang, or the ""Diamond Mountain,"" lies about 90 miles from Pyeongchang's Olympic Stadium, but it's a world away: The august, multipeaked range lies in North Korea and has been impossible to visit for most of the past seven decades. Featuring stunning loans from the National Museum of Korea and other institutions in Seoul, South Korea, this melancholy beauty of a show assembles three centuries' worth of paintings of the Diamond Mountain range, and explores how landscapes intermingle nostalgia, nationalism, legend and regret. The unmissable prizes here are the painstaking paintings of Jeong Seon, the 18th-century artist who is perhaps the greatest of all Korean painters. And later impressions of the mountains, including a blotchy vision from the Paris-based modernist Lee Ungno, give a deeper historical weight to very live geopolitics. (Farago)

In the African wing, a show of just four commanding wooden crowns constitutes a blockbuster in its own right. These massive wooden crests -- in the form of stylized human faces with vast vertical brows -- served as markers of royal power among the Bamileke peoples of the Cameroonian grasslands, and the Met's recent acquisition of an 18th-century specimen is joined here by three later examples, each featuring sharply protruding cheeks, broadly smiling mouths and brows incised with involute geometric patterns. Ritual objects like these were decisive for the development of Western modernist painting, and a Cameroonian crest was even shown at MoMA in the 1930s, as a ""sculpture"" divorced from ethnography. But these crests had legal and diplomatic significance as well as aesthetic appeal, and their anonymous African creators had a political understanding of art not so far from our own. (Farago)

'THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION' at the Museum of the Moving Image. The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America's great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program ""Sam and Friends"" before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother's old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through ""Sesame Street"" and ""The Muppet Show,"" though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and story boards and rediscover some old friends. (Farago)

718-784-0077, movingimage.us 'PETER HUJAR: SPEED OF LIFE' at the Morgan Library and Museum (through May 20). It's hard to say which is more surprising: that Peter Hujar's photographs of underground life in New York in the 1970s and '80s have found their way to the Morgan Library and Museum, or that the classically minded institution has become unbuttoned enough to exhibit them in this heartbreaker of a show. Hujar (1934-87) lived most of his professional life in the East Village and, through studio portraits and cityscapes, captured a downtown that has since been all but erased by time, gentrification and AIDS. Although he was little known by the mainstream art world in his lifetime, this show, startlingly tender, reveals him to be one of the major American photographers of the late 20th century.

It remains a bit of a tourist trap, but the for-profit Museum of Sex is making its most serious bid yet for artistic credibility with a two-floor exhibition of Japan's most prominent and controversial photographer. Nobuyoshi Araki has spent decades shooting Tokyo streetscapes, blossoming flowers and, notably, women trussed up in the baroque rope bondage technique known as kinbaku-bi, or ""the beauty of tight binding."" Given the venue, it's natural that this show concentrates on the erotic side of his art, but less lustful visitors can discover an ambitious cross section of Mr. Araki's omnivorous photography, including his lastingly moving ""Sentimental Journey,"" picturing his beloved wife, Yoko, from honeymoon to funeral.

It gathers together some 120 sculptures, dolls, artist's dummies, effigies, crucifixes and automatons. Many are rarely lent and may not return any time soon. (Roberta Smith)

'THE LONG RUN' at the Museum of Modern Art (through Nov. 4). The museum upends its cherished Modern narrative of ceaseless progress by mostly young (white) men. Instead we see works by artists 45 and older who have just kept on keeping on, regardless of attention or reward, sometimes saving the best for last. Art here is an older person's game, a pursuit of a deepening personal vision over innovation. Winding through 17 galleries, the installation is alternatively visually or thematically acute and altogether inspiring. (Smith)

212-708-9400, moma.org 'MILLENNIUM: LOWER MANHATTAN IN THE 1990S' at the Skyscraper Museum (through April). This plucky Battery Park institution transports us back to the years of Rudy Giuliani, Lauryn Hill and 128-kilobit modems to reveal the enduring urban legacy of a decade bookended by recession and terror. In the wake of the 1987 stock market crash, landlords in the financial district rezoned their old skyscrapers for residential occupancy, and more than 20 towers were declared landmarks, including the ornate Standard Oil building at 26 Broadway and the home of Delmonico's at 56 Beaver Street. Battery Park City flowered; yuppies priced out of TriBeCa came down to Wall Street; a new Guggenheim, designed by a fresh-from-Bilbao Frank Gehry, nearly arose by South Street Seaport. From this distance, the 1990s can seem almost like a golden age, not least given that, more than 16 years after Sept. 11, construction at the underwhelming new World Trade Center is still not finished.

'OUTLIERS AND AMERICAN VANGUARD ART' at the National Gallery of Art, Washington (through May 13). Tracing the interaction of taught and untaught artists over the past century, this exhibition tackles an impossibly immense subject and starts stronger than it finishes. But it presents quantities of stunning art in all mediums, revealing the vastness of American creativity and the many attempts by museums to do it justice. It proves more forcefully than ever that the distinction between the works of the self-taught and that of the professionals has outlived its relevance. (Smith)

202-737-4215, nga.gov 'REBEL SPIRITS: ROBERT F. KENNEDY AND MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.' at the New-York Historical Society (through May 20). Delve into the ties that bound these progressive standard-bearers through photographs that document their rise to the national stage in the 1950s and '60s and the struggle for the societal changes they championed, and ephemera such as magazines, campaign buttons, protest placards and an R.F.K.-M.L.K. spinning pendant. You can even listen on a transistor radio to the song Dick Holler wrote after their assassinations in 1968, ""Abraham, Martin and John."" (Danielle Dowling)

212-873-3400, nyhistory.org 'ALBERTO SAVINIO' at the Center for Italian Modern Art (through June 23). The paintings of this Italian polymath have long been overshadowed by the brilliant work of his older brother, Giorgio de Chirico. This show of more than 20 canvases from the late 1920s to the mid-'30s may not change that, but the mix of landscapes with bright patterns and several eerie portraits based on family photographs are surprisingly of the moment.

'SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION' at the Jewish Museum. After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike -- Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilletantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago)

212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org 'STEPHEN SHORE' at the Museum of Modern Art (through May 28). Not staged, not lit, not cropped, not retouched, the color photographs of this American master are feats of dispassionate representation. This must-see retrospective -- curated with real wit by Quentin Bajac, MoMA's photo chief -- opens with Mr. Shore's teenage snaps at Andy Warhol's Factory. Then it turns to the road-trip imagery of ""American Surfaces"" and the steely precision of ""Uncommon Places"" -- landmarks in photographic history that scandalized an establishment convinced the camera could find beauty solely in black-and-white. Mr. Shore is revealed not only as a peripatetic explorer but also a restless experimenter with new photographic technologies, from stereoscopic slide shows to print-on-demand books. The only flaw is his recent embrace of Instagram, allowing museumgoers to lazily flick through images on MoMA's smudged iPads. New technologies are great, but not at the expense of concentration.

212-708-9400, moma.org '2018 TRIENNIAL: SONGS FOR SABOTAGE' at the New Museum (through May 27). This Bowery museum's fourth triennial exhibition, ""Songs for Sabotage,"" is the smallest, tightest edition of the show so far. Immaculately installed, it's also the best looking. There's a lot of good work, which is global in scope and not by a list of prevetted up-and-comers. (Zhenya Machneva, Dalton Paula and Daniela Ortiz are artists to look for.) Less admirably, it's a safe and unchallenging show. Despite a politically demanding time, it acts as if ambiguity and discretion were automatically virtues. In an era when the market rules, it puts its money on the kind of art -- easily tradable, displayable, palette-tickling objects -- that art fairs suck up. (Cotter)

212-219-1222, newmuseum.org 'THE VIETNAM WAR: 1945-1975' at the New-York Historical Society (through April 22). In contrast to the PBS series ""The Vietnam War,"" this exhibition delivers historical data, a lot of it, quick and dirty, through labels, film and audio clips and objects, some of which fall under a broad definition of art. Along with paintings by contemporary Vietnamese artists, there's graffiti-style drawings on combat helmets and Zippo lighters, and period design in album covers and protest posters. Words and images work together in murals labeled ""Home Front"" and ""War Front"" that put you in the middle of the war's primary issues and events. (Cotter)

212-873-3400, nyhistory.org 'DAHN VO: TAKE MY BREATH AWAY' at the Guggenheim Museum (through May 9). This is the first museum survey of the Vietnam-born Danish artist, who draws his art from his life and the history he has lived through, recycling family mementos, found letters and artifacts, as well as random materials, into a very spare, poetic and astute study of power, colonialism, and the lives of refugees and of objects. The Guggenheim's rotunda looks nearly empty at times, and there are lots of labels to read, but it is ultimately worth it. (Smith) 

212-423-3500, guggenheim.org 'GRANT WOOD: AMERICAN GOTHIC AND OTHER FABLES' at the Whitney Museum of American Art (through June 10). This well-done survey begins with the American Regionalist's little-known efforts as an Arts and Crafts designer and touches just about every base. It includes his mural studies, book illustrations and most of his best-known paintings -- including ""American Gothic"" and ""The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere."" Best of all are Wood's smooth undulant landscapes with their plowmen and spongy trees and infectious serenity. (Smith)

'ZURBARAN'S JACOB AND HIS TWELVE SONS: PAINTINGS FROM AUCKLAND CASTLE' at the Frick Collection (through April 22). More devout than Velazquez, more shadowy than Murillo, Francisco de Zurbaran was little known outside Spain until the mid-19th century, when Manet and his friends found the seeds of modernism in his frisky, open brushwork and streamlined form. The Frick is now showing a baker's dozen of the Spaniard's biblical portraits, of an aged, hunched Jacob and the sons who would become the founders of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, with most of the paintings on loan from a castle that until recently belonged to the Church of England. The gents pose in a startling variety of crisp, supple fabrics, whose glamour or grittiness echoes Jacob's foretelling of their destinies in Genesis. Two are especially compelling: Judah, child No. 4, decked out in a fur-trimmed coat and vamping alongside a kindly lion, and Joseph, who forgoes the Technicolor dreamcoat for a blue sash and a belt stitched with gold.

212-288-0700, frick.org 'THE BEAUTIFUL BRAIN: THE DRAWINGS OF SANTIAGO RAMON Y CAJAL' at Grey Art Gallery (through March 31). The first United States museum exhibition devoted to the scientific illustrations of this Spanish giant of neuroscience is among the year's best so far. Its 80 freehand renderings of different brain cells, as viewed through a microscope, helped prove that they are unconnected, communicating across tiny gaps called synaptic clefts, which earned Cajal a Nobel Prize in 1906. His exquisite images, still used in textbooks, ignite synaptic charges throughout 20th-century art, from Surrealism onward. (Smith)

212-998-6780, greyartgallery.nyu.edu 'JOYCE J. SCOTT: HARRIET TUBMAN AND OTHER TRUTHS' at Grounds for Sculpture (through April 1). The work of this recent MacArthur fellowship winner, Nancy Princenthal wrote in The Times, ""proves just how sharp glass can get."" Ms. Scott uses hand-threaded beads and blown glass to create art that is ""a revelation, inviting covetous attention to what often turn out, on close inspection, to be brutal subjects: vicious racism, violent misogyny,"" Ms. Princenthal added. Among the exhibition's highlights are three sculptures of Harriet Tubman, including one armed with a flower-embossed rifle and one made of rammed earth that is meant to erode over time at this Hamilton, N.J., sculpture garden.

Theater,"For Early 'Jersey Boys' Investors, Oh, What a Run",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/14/theater/from-san-diego-to-broadway-by-way-of-jersey.html,"SAN DIEGO -- A local dentist put in $12,500. A venture capitalist was good for $1.4 million. There were a literary agent, a psychotherapist and a smattering of doctors, lawyers and academics, all investing together in a promising musical at their hometown theater that was seeking a shot at Broadway. That small posse from San Diego ended up pooling a significant portion of the $7.8 million necessary to deliver one of the most popular Broadway musicals in recent decades, ""Jersey Boys."" And these novices did something that most theater investors never do: Made big money. Roughly three out of four Broadway shows fail financially, even though many of them are backed by entertainment industry pros.

""I know every line of the show, and for a certain period of time, everything that would happen would remind me of a line in the show,"" said Kevin Kinsella, the San Diego venture capitalist who became the largest individual investor in ""Jersey Boys,"" a jukebox biomusical that tells the story of the Four Seasons, the 1960s pop band fronted by Frankie Valli. Mr. Kinsella had never invested in Broadway, but had a personal interest: His father, Walter A. Kinsella, played the bugle in a 1924 Broadway play, ""What Price Glory,"" and went on to act in others. Mr. Kinsella, who estimates that he has seen the show 130 times, used profits to purchase a private library in La Jolla where he installed a museum-style gallery of ""Jersey Boys"" memorabilia. And he embeds medallions featuring images of a grapevine's four seasons (Get it? Four Seasons?) in the bottles from his Sonoma winery (yes, he has a winery). Many of the investors put money not only into the Broadway show but also into subsequent productions, rolling a portion of their profits from one production into the next and making it difficult to estimate with any precision how much they ultimately made. Dr. Richard Harmetz, the dentist who started with a $12,500 investment and continued to put money into subsequent productions, estimated his profit at $250,000 to $300,000. Edward and Martha Dennis, a biochemistry professor and venture capitalist who started with a $10,000 investment, estimated a similar return.

A spokesman for the show said that profitability estimate was too high but did not offer an alternative figure. The lead producers, a New York-based partnership called the Dodgers, would not discuss their financing. ""Jersey Boys"" is in some ways an example of how Broadway shows are financed: The industry is rooted in New York, but many plays and musicals have financial backers who live around the world -- theater enthusiasts with an appetite for risk and a taste for show business. But ""Jersey Boys"" stands out for the size of its success and the concentration of its support in an affluent village, La Jolla, that is about as far from the Garden State Parkway as one can get in the mainland United States. It appears that as much as 40 percent of the show's financing was raised in San Diego -- almost all of it from people who had never previously invested in a Broadway show, and who encountered this one as patrons at the La Jolla Playhouse, where the musical was enormously popular and repeatedly extended. ""I wasn't looking for another project, but it was extremely compelling -- it was a moving, really smart show, and it was an easy jump to look at this and say, 'I want to help make that happen on Broadway,'"" said Gail Bryan, who invested with her husband, Ralph. At the time, Ms. Bryan was running a software business called Latitude Link; her experience with ""Jersey Boys"" was so encouraging that she repurposed the firm as a production company. It now has credits on 14 Broadway shows, including the 2015 Tony-winning musical ""Fun Home."" ""Jersey Boys,"" which opened in 2005 and overcame mixed critical reception to win the 2006 Tony Award for best new musical, has not only had a long-running production in New York, but has also been produced in Chicago, Las Vegas, London, San Francisco and Toronto and has been performed across Asia and elsewhere. A United States tour is continuing; a tour of Britain begins later this year, and one in Australia begins next year.

There is a shadow over the show's success: a federal jury in Nevada last year found against its creators in a copyright infringement case brought by the widow of a writer who had been working on a never-published autobiography of one of the band members. But the musical's creators are appealing the decision, and it is not clear whether the investors have any liability; the defendants are the show's writers and its director. For the investors, the experience was transformative, and not just because it generated a nice profit. Many have traveled around the world to see productions of the show. The Dennises took 40 people from Mr. Dennis's Yale alumni class to see the show in London. Marsi and Eric Gardiner moved to New York and show up every year at a party for the anniversary of opening night. Several investors will be at the final show this weekend. Those who have gone on to back other Broadway shows have learned the hard way that ""Jersey Boys"" was a rare exception. Mr. Kinsella sank $750,000 in a revival of ""Jesus Christ Superstar,"" which closed at a total loss three months after opening, and many others had similar experiences. ""We got a little overconfident,"" said Margret McBride, a literary agent who invested in ""Jersey Boys"" with her husband, Nevins, and then in a play that flopped. And Wanda Garner, a psychotherapist who invested in ""Jersey Boys"" with her husband, Cam, offered this bit of advice to would-be Broadway backers: ""If you're going to put your money down, you better be able to lose it all.""

Ivor Royston, a local biotech investor who raised about $1 million from about 20 San Diego friends to invest in ""Jersey Boys"" after a major backer dropped out, went on to back several other shows with the same partnership, the Pelican Group. The Pelican Group's biggest bet was on ""Doctor Zhivago,"" which had an early chapter in La Jolla, and, after that show's failure, Dr. Royston now doubts the very same instincts he thought were so great after he spotted ""Jersey Boys."" ""I'm done for a while -- I'm taking a rest,"" he said. ""It does show you how much of a crapshoot this thing is."" Despite the odds of failure, a few of the San Diegans have become Broadway regulars. The Gardiners, for example, have supported a half-dozen shows, even decorating their home with Playbills. Some of their picks have flopped, including ""Gigi"" and ""Allegiance,"" but they love supporting the art form and getting to know the players, and they were among the early producers of one of this season's most acclaimed new musicals, ""Dear Evan Hansen,"" which is shaping up to be a hit. ""Broadway is my passion and my hobby,"" Mr. Gardiner, who works in financial services, said. ""I'm really into stories."" ""Jersey Boys"" benefited not only the investors but also the La Jolla Playhouse, which is one of the nation's biggest regional theaters and regularly stages shows that wind up moving to Broadway -- this season's ""Come From Away"" and ""Indecent"" will be Nos. 27 and 28. The theater received 3 percent of the net profits from ""Jersey Boys,"" as well as a small royalty that increased slightly (to 1.25 percent of the gross from 1 percent) after the show recouped its capitalization costs. That money helped the theater weather the 2008-9 recession. The individual investors, meanwhile, are philosophical as the show's Broadway run comes to a close. Dr. Harmetz, who invested $12,500 on his own behalf, as well as $12,500 for his mother, which helped finance her end-of-life care, cherishes the framed Playbills and tickets and press clips he has saved from opening-night performances of ""Jersey Boys"" in New York, London and Las Vegas. He said the show had changed his life in small ways -- he and his wife go to the theater more often, in San Diego and New York, and donate more to the arts. And when they go out to dinner, he said, ""My wife will look at the menu, and I'll say: 'Pat, what are you worried about? We're Broadway producers!""","About three out of four Broadway shows lose money. But not ""Jersey Boys.""

Opinion,The Politics We Don't See Matter as Much as Those We Do,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/12/opinion/census-politics-gerrymandering-redistricting.html,"Party strategists pay a lot of attention to redrawing district maps -- and hope you won't bother to think about it.

The Politics We Don't See Matter as Much as Those We Do

Some of the most important developments in politics do not happen every election cycle, but every ten years, when politicians scrap the old battleground map and struggle to replace it with a new one more favorable to their interests. Steven Hill, a former fellow at New America, described how this works in his still pertinent 2003 book ""Fixing Elections: The Failure of America's Winner Take All Politics."" ""Beginning in early 2001, a great tragedy occurred in American politics,"" Hill wrote. As a result of that tragedy, ""most voters had their vote rendered nearly meaningless, almost as if it had been stolen from them"" as ""hallowed notions such as 'no taxation without representation' and 'one person, one vote' have been drained of their vitality, reduced to empty slogans."" Hill was referring to ""the process of redistricting"" that he argued was legalized ""theft"" engaged in by ""the two major political parties, their incumbents, and their consultants,"" which Hill said was ""part of the everyday give-and-take (mostly take) of America's winner-take-all politics.""

Hill first made his argument at a time when both parties were still colluding in developing new districts designed to protect incumbents, Republicans and Democrats alike. Since then, the parties have abandoned any semblance of bipartisanship and are now fully engaged in an all-out battle for control of state legislatures. A basic objective remains the same, however: to effectively disenfranchise key segments of the electorate. As Devin Caughey, a political scientist at M.I.T. and the lead author of ""Partisan Gerrymandering and the Political Process,"" explained in an email: The goal of partisan gerrymandering is to maximize one party's seat share given their vote share. The means to this end is drawing districts that waste as many votes for the opposing party as possible, while wasting as few votes as possible for one's own party. In addition to creating wasted votes -- thus undermining a key principle of democracy -- an additional consequence of gerrymandering is what Nicholas Stephanopoulos of Harvard Law School calls ""representational distortion"": the adoption of policies that do not have majority support in the electorate.
* Mark Penn and Andrew Stein write that ""only a broader course correction to the center will give Democrats a fighting chance in 2022"" and beyond.
* Tory Gavito and Adam Jentleson write that the Virgina loss should ""shock Democrats into confronting the powerful role that racially coded attacks play in American politics.""
* Ezra Klein speaks to David Shor, who discusses his fear that Democrats face electoral catastrophe unless they shift their messaging.
* Ross Douthat writes that the outcome of the Virginia gubernatorial race shows Democrats need a ""new way to talk about progressive ideology and education."" Stephanopoulos, the author of the 2018 paper ""The Causes and Consequences of Gerrymandering,"" described ""one glaring example,"" in an email: Democrats got more votes than Republicans in the 2012 and 2018 Wisconsin state legislative elections. So in a world without gerrymandering, Democrats would have been able to block all kinds of conservative policies between 2012 and 2014, including environmental deregulation, tax cuts, abortion restrictions, gun deregulation, etc. Instead, Republican majorities in both branches of the Wisconsin legislature enacted all of those policies, as well as a package of anti-union measures. In the 2018 election, Democrats won 53 percent of all votes cast in the Wisconsin State Assembly contests, but won 36 percent of the State Assembly seats.

What is undeniably a democratic malfunction, though, is representation that does not reflect the ideological preferences of the electorate -- representation that is much more liberal or much more conservative than voters actually want. Single-party control of redistricting fosters partisan unfairness more than any other variable, and that such unfairness translates directly into ideologically distorted representation. Caughey is also concerned about gerrymandering because it leads to a denial of political representation of the majority electorate: Our basic point about distortion of representation is that partisan gerrymandering pulls state policies in the ideological direction of the party that controls redistricting. This policy effect follows from two facts: (1) gerrymandering allows one party to capture more seats than it would otherwise control, and (2) the occupants of the extra seats vote very differently from the members of the opposite party who would otherwise have occupied those seats. Since the party in power can ""skew policies toward its preferences,"" Caughey continues, ""the policy effects of additional seats are greatest when party control hangs in the balance. Thus, gerrymandering is most consequential when it gives one party a majority of seats when it would otherwise have a minority."" Richard Pildes, a law professor at N.Y.U. and an outspoken critic of distorted legislative districts, wrote in an email: Gerrymandering is antithetical to democracy; politicians should have to compete for popular support under neutral, fair rules of engagement -- rather than being able to manipulate the playing field to entrench themselves and their allies in power. about as pure an example as we have of insiders rigging the system for their own benefit. It also poisons state legislatures, when the decade begins with one party ramming down the throat of the other a manipulative map that affects the state for a decade. The fight to control redistricting next year is taking place in relatively low visibility races for legislative seats in states ranging from Kansas to Texas to Minnesota.

The Princeton Election Consortium has produced a detailed analysis of those elections in six states, Texas, Minnesota, Connecticut, Kansas, Florida and North Carolina. The consortium, which is headed by Sam Wang, a professor of neuroscience at Princeton, identifies the key ""races where voters have the most leverage to prevent partisan gerrymandering in 2021. A few hundred voters mobilized in the right districts could bring bipartisan control of redistricting to a state, leading to fairer districts for a decade."" The consortium found, for example, that a cluster of eight Kansas state house districts in Johnson County, an affluent suburb of Kansas City, offers key opportunities for Democratic voters and donors to shift the balance of power statewide. In a reflection of partisan enthusiasm, in 2019, the first full year of the current election cycle, Johnson County Democrats outraised Johnson County Republicans $108,314 to $58,480. In North Carolina, the consortium identified three districts in the Highpoint-Greensboro-Winston Salem region as strong targets for Democrats seeking to wrest control of the North Carolina house.

Gerrymandering battlegrounds vary widely, both in terms of the parties' goals and strategies. In Kansas, for example, where Republicans overwhelmingly dominate both branches of the legislature, the Democratic goal is to pick up just one more seat in the Kansas House. That would give the party enough votes to block a Republican gerrymander by preventing the Republican majority from overriding a veto by the Democratic governor of a Republican redistricting plan. In other words, without veto-proof majorities in both branches, Republicans would be forced to work with Democrats in drawing both legislative and congressional district lines. In Minnesota, the Democratic goal is to gain a State Senate majority by winning at least two additional seats. If successful, Democrats would then have complete control over redistricting -- a so-called trifecta -- the governor, the State Senate and the state House, with Republicans left powerless. Republicans currently have trifectas in 21 states, Democrats in 15 -- the remaining states have divided government. Fourteen states, including California, Ohio and Michigan, have shifted control over redistricting from the state legislature to an independent commission. Eleven others use independent commissions either to advise legislatures or to step in when no agreement can be reached. Republicans control both branches of the legislature in 29 states to the Democrats 19, with the only split in Minnesota. (Nebraska's state government is unicameral.) For partisans engaged in state legislative battles, anti-democratic concerns over gerrymandering fall on largely deaf ears -- these activists are forced by the rules of the game to compete in redistricting contests because the stakes are so high. Take the issue of voting rights and the sustained efforts by Republicans to suppress turnout, especially among pro-Democratic minorities. Richard Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California-Irvine, wrote by email: The trend at the Supreme Court and in the lower courts, increasingly stacked with Trump appointees, is a pullback on federal protection of voting rights. That means that many voting rights struggles will begin and end with what state legislatures -- and in some cases state supreme courts applying state constitutions -- say the rules will be. Fredrick Cornelius Harris, a professor of political science and director of the Center on African-American Politics and Society at Columbia, warned that current developments -- the likely census undercount of minorities and the poor and the Trump administration's discouragement of immigrants from filling out census forms, together with the Covid-19 pandemic -- will weaken the political leverage of minorities post-2021 redistricting. These factors, Harris wrote by email, ""could impact the reapportionment of seats in state legislatures,"" before adding that A weakened voting rights act -- this will be the first reapportionment since Shelby County vs. Holder -- could have an impact on the number of majority-minority districts in the South. Since Republicans run state houses in the Deep South, there can be a potential loss of seats for Democrats and Black/Latino legislators in some of those states if Republicans choose to do so. In many of the key states where state legislative contests are fought most intensely, Democrats are generally on offense and Republican on defense. A major factor driving this difference is the continuing suburban animosity toward Trump that is pushing many independents and nominally Republican voters toward the Democratic Party, as the 2018 election demonstrated.

This pattern of Republican vulnerability has proved especially true in Texas, where Democrats are determined to capitalize on the major gains they have made in state and federal contests in the suburbs of Dallas, Houston and other cities. Robert M. Stein, a political scientist at Rice University who has been closely following contests in Texas where Democrats need to gain nine seats to take control of the state house, wrote me: The polling I am seeing and expect to see in the next few weeks suggests the Democrats have a better than even chance -- 55 percent likelihood -- of picking up more than nine seats. the registration numbers are moving away from the Republicans' previous 1 million voter advantage. Since 2017, 5 percent more Democrats registered to vote in Texas than Republicans and this advantage appears to be widening since the first of the year. The demographic shift is bearing fruit for Texas Democrats and in a predictable fashion. In the national fund-raising competition, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee is slightly behind the Republican State Leadership Committee for the period from January 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020, according to I.R.S. records, $28.1 million to $32.8 million. These figures do not, however, take into account the surge in support of other Democratic groups involved in state legislative contests. The most important of these is the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, headed by former Attorney General Eric Holder, which has raised more than $50 million since its founding in 2017. The committee backs Democratic legislative candidates but requires them to support efforts to restrict gerrymandering, including the creation of independent redistricting commissions. While Democrats are on the offensive, especially in suburban legislative seats across the county, the party is fighting an uphill battle overall. Charles Nuttycombe, director of CNalysis, an election forecasting firm, assessed the likely outcomes of state legislative races in ""The State of the States: The Legislatures,"" an essay published at Crystal Ball, the political website run by Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia. Nuttycombe's conclusion is best summarized in the sub-headline: ""Don't expect much overall change even as many chambers are competitive."" One of the major problems Democrats face is the unexpected resilience of a $30 million 2010 Republican program called Redmap -- the Redistricting Majority Project. This exceptionally successful initiative was developed by Ed Gillespie and Karl Rove, who recognized the crucial role of state legislatures in determining the balance of power in Congress. As Reuters reported, in the 2010 election, the Republican Redmap project netted some 700 state seats, increasing its share of state House and Senate seats by almost 10 percent, from approximately 3200 to over 3900. It took over both legislative chambers in 25 states and won total control of 21 states (legislature and governorship) -- the greatest such victory since 1928. Christopher Warshaw, a political scientist at George Washington University, is a co-author with Devin Caughey and Chris Tausanovitch, a political scientist at U.C.L.A., of ""Partisan Gerrymandering and the Political Process,"" which I mentioned earlier. Warshaw emailed me about the continued success of Redmap: It's really remarkable how extreme and durable some of the gerrymanders from 2011-12 have been. A number of studies have shown that the Republican gerrymanders in places like Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin were among the most extreme in history. In Congress, these gerrymandered maps probably gained Republicans at least a dozen seats. One study recently estimated that Republicans gained 27 seats in Congress from the 2011 maps. In the case of Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin, Warshaw pointed out, Republicans have continued to control the majority of seats year after year in both chambers of the state legislatures. This is despite the fact that Democrats received a majority of the votes in state legislative elections in all three states in 2018. In some of these states, Democrats would probably need to win the popular vote by more than 10 percent to win control of the state legislature. So while I do think that Democrats will win control of a couple more chambers in 2020 if Biden continues to have an 8+ point lead over President Trump, it's going to be very difficult for Democrats to overcome the Republican gerrymanders in places like Michigan, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. In other words, Democrats may have the wind at their backs this year, but the roadblocks Republicans have constructed over the course of the past decade are quite likely to prove insurmountable, for quite some time, no matter which party takes the White House, no matter how meaningless voters find the ballots they cast and no matter how many American voters are deprived of a voice.

Sports,"A Long Trip, a U.S. Open Bubble and a Terrible Luck of the Draw",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/01/sports/tennis/us-open-draw-loss.html,"Anhelina Kalinina thought she had hit the jackpot just by playing in the United States Open. When tennis officials first announced the initial field of 128 total players in the men's and women's singles draws, Kalinina did not make the cut. But then, players kept dropping out, mostly because they did not want to deal with the dangers of the coronavirus pandemic and the hassles of traveling, including being confined to a Long Island hotel for several weeks. Players in the U.S. Open had to agree to a lengthy set of restrictions as the tournament's organizers attempted to create a so-called bubble, an environment that would be mostly self-contained to help prevent the spread of the virus. Kalinina, who lives in Kyiv, Ukraine, kept climbing up the list of alternates. Then, a little more than a week before the tournament, she got in. She flew 5,000 miles, landed in New York last Monday and began practicing the next day. By Thursday, her luck had turned. She drew the No. 1 seed, Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic, as her first-round opponent. Their match lasted 62 minutes, with Pliskova winning 6-4, 6-0.

""A little tough to go out and play the top seed in my first match,"" said Kalinina, who struggled to find hitting partners over the past five months in Ukraine. Damir Dzumhur's luck was nearly as bad. After more than two weeks in New York, the Bosnian's stay was cut short after the world No. 1 Novak Djokovic sent him out in straight sets in the first round on Monday. ""My friends were telling me how lucky I was to be in New York,"" Dzumhur said after his loss. ""I keep telling them, 'Don't be jealous.'"" The health crisis has wreaked havoc on sports and life in countless ways. At the U.S. Open, it is making tough first-round matchups and quick exits feel especially cruel. In normal years, a tournament entry, even for those who do not last very long, comes with a free room at a Midtown Manhattan hotel and a chance to enjoy the city's nightlife and shopping during any downtime. But this year, for most participants, an entry has meant at least two weeks at a hotel in the middle of parking lot in Uniondale on Long Island and few extracurricular options other than arcades and cafe areas at the hotel or the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.

Dzumhur traveled from Belgrade and spent 16 days in the bubble. He lost in the second round in the Western & Southern Open, which preceded the U.S. Open and was held on the same site. His U.S. Open run ended in one hour, 58 minutes. For three total matches in New York, Dzumhur will have ultimately spent two-plus weeks in relative seclusion and traveled 9,000 miles in the air. That sort of Grand Slam experience is getting old for Dzumhur, ranked 109th in the world. His last three Grand Slam tournaments he drew Roger Federer, then Stan Wawrinka and Djokovic in the first round. Three champions right off the bat -- the tennis equivalent of being dealt a 16 at the blackjack table. Dzumhur said he has no regrets about this trip, though. During his time in the bubble he burned through nearly all five seasons of ""Breaking Bad,"" which he enjoyed, and got to be back at work, an opportunity not lost on many tennis players who have been without their primary source of income since March. He had his chances, too, against Djokovic, missing a handful of break points in the second set before Djokovic pulled away to win 6-1, 6-4, 6-1. ""I don't mind playing Nole,"" Dzumhur said, using the nickname of his good friend, Djokovic, ""but maybe next time I can get him in a third or a fourth round.""

Ironically, Dzumhur probably came into this tournament as well prepared as any other journeyman following the long layoff. Belgrade, where he lives, is a hotbed of tennis talent. He hit often with the gaggle of pros who live or spend time in and around the city -- Viktor Troicki, Filip Krajinovic, and occasionally Djokovic -- at a club owned by a friend. Even though the club was closed to the public, the friend opened it for the local professionals so they could stay in shape.",Anhelina Kalinina and Damir Dzumhur traveled from Eastern Europe to get to the United States Open.

In trousers and tailcoat, she'd make her way through Europe, and make a name for herself in the bargain. She'd ""become Shakespeare and Dickens and Thackeray,"" she tells her sisters, who have much tamer dreams.

For some of us, Jo has always been the most compelling character by far in Louisa May Alcott's coming-of-age novel ""Little Women."" In reworking it for the stage, Kate Hamill (best known for her smart, sprightly Jane Austen adaptations) has done the dramatically sensible thing and placed Jo at the center -- along with Laurie, the spirited boy next door, who loves Jo in a way that she can't return.

""You can be lonely in a crowd, if it's not the right crowd,"" Jo tells the girls, and so she is, stuck in a world of women when her every fiber yearns to adventure alongside the men. All the nonsense restrictions of ladylike behavior -- and feminine dress -- only make her struggle harder.

From the opening moments of the play, directed by Sarna Lapine and presented by Primary Stages at the Cherry Lane Theater, Kristolyn Lloyd makes a charming and entirely sympathetic Jo.

""Politics has a bigger influence on markets than any time I've known.""

""Whatever your views of the world are, even putting a portfolio together is quite tricky,"" he said.

Mr. O'Connor, a native of Dundalk, Ireland, who first began working in the financial district in 1995 after a career as a management consultant, rattled off a list of issues that could affect prices on financial markets: unrest in the Middle East, instability in Turkey, risks in Russia.

Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain has said she will begin formal talks on the country's exit from the European Union by March.

Style,Are Manhattanites Becoming Brooklyn's Bridge-and-Tunnel Crowd?,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/05/style/are-manhattanites-becoming-brooklyns-bridge-and-tunnel-crowd.html,"The scene at Otter Box , a Sunday-night party at the Flat in Williamsburg.

I'm a two-time bridge-and-tunnel person. Having regularly fled my native Brooklyn because it wasn't fun enough, I'm now insinuating my way back in there because my adopted borough isn't fun enough. My first bridge-and-tunnel phase happened in the 1970s, after I graduated from Columbia College and shacked up with my parents in the humble home in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, I'd grown up in. But having tasted Manhattan glamour for four years, I wasn't exactly going to stay in Brooklyn. Drawn to Manhattan's limitless entertainment options, I'd ride the subway at night and go to disco hot spots like Studio 54, the home of fizzy, celebrity-filled evenings of twinkle-toed euphoria. Sometimes I even got in, though I was never considered A-list. I was bridge-and-tunnel -- the lowest of the low -- and everyone knew it, from the second I crawled out of the subway, to the moment I ran back there to try to get home by 5 a.m.

For decades after that, bridge-and-tunnel people were considered a necessary evil. While we were deemed tasteless outcasts who brought down a crowd because we refused to find lodging in the only borough that counted, B&T, as it is often abbreviated, actually paid for admission and drinks. Well, now, a perverse twist of fate has returned me to that awful status. In a reversal I never saw coming, Brooklyn is now the place to go for bohemia, performance art and off-center clubbing, all of those disciplines seeming to move over the bridge, where the setting is more affordable. Savvier Manhattanites have been swarming there for years, and as I frantically leave the East Side to join them, I hopelessly find that I'm bridge-and-tunnel all over again! In a weird ""Planet of the Apes"" plot turn, the hairier primates are suddenly in charge, and I'm begging them for guest-list action.

Apparently I couldn't be a B&T, even if I wanted to. Last summer, I did make it to Bushwig, a two-day drag festival in Bushwick, Brooklyn, held at the arts center Secret Project Robot. But it wasn't easy, and once I arrived, I didn't generate much excitement from the locals. I guess I am bridge-and-tunnel, after all. Things were so much smoother when the original drag festival Wigstock took place in downtown Manhattan. I could ride my bike there, and get the crowd's attention. But that's when I was considered a scene maker, not a traveling trashionista hitching a ride to a diet soda and a dream. I've tried other ways of getting out there. In January, I heard about Otter Box, a new Sunday-night party at the Flat in Williamsburg, so a friend and I feverishly ordered a car service. But the first car came an hour early, and didn't return. A different car service did get us there and back, but the whole thing was such an ordeal that it took the sparkle out of the proceedings. Uber is a more reliable way to go, so one time, I got a friend to take a bunch of us to Verboten, a large Brooklyn dance club of the type that's become rare in Manhattan. It was fab, and I was comforted to see other Manhattanites there.","A native Brooklynite who moved to Manhattan grouses about becoming bridge-and-tunnel again, as the downtown scene shifts to the outer boroughs.",3a23d5cb-3b1f-524c-b5a7-a7a1bf57d454,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/05/fashion/04BRIDGE2/04BRIDGE2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=ca9ab7f024a514fdf34d96a55aa8507d34e16d7adfe1f75b75e1e94591e58e6a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The scene at Otter Box, a Sunday-night party at the Flat in Williamsburg.",3a23d5cb-3b1f-524c-b5a7-a7a1bf57d454,N24News/imgs/3a23d5cb-3b1f-524c-b5a7-a7a1bf57d454.jpg,15
Health,"Effective Ovarian Cancer Treatment Is Underused, Study Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/04/health/ovarian-cancer-abdominal-chemotherapy-underused.html,"In 2006, the National Cancer Institute took the rare step of issuing a ""clinical announcement,"" a special alert it holds in reserve for advances so important that they should change medical practice. In this case, the subject was ovarian cancer. A major study had just proved that pumping chemotherapy directly into the abdomen, along with the usual intravenous method, could add 16 months or more to women's lives. Cancer experts agreed that medical practice should change -- immediately. Nearly a decade later, doctors report that fewer than half of ovarian cancer patients at American hospitals are receiving the abdominal treatment. ""It's very unfortunate, but it's the real world,"" said Dr. Maurie Markman, the president of medicine and science at Cancer Treatment Centers of America. He added, ""The word 'tragic' would be fair.""

Experts suggest a variety of reasons that the treatment is so underused: It is harder to administer than intravenous therapy, and some doctors may still doubt its benefits or think it is too toxic. Some may also see it as a drain on their income, because it is time-consuming and uses generic drugs on which oncologists make little money. Dr. Markman said that when a treatment involves a new drug or a new device, manufacturers eagerly offer doctors advice and instructions on its use. But this treatment involves no new drugs or devices, so no one is clamoring to educate doctors about it. They are on their own to learn, and to train their nurses, a commitment that will take time and money. This year, 21,290 new cases of ovarian cancer are expected in the United States, and 14,180 deaths. Dr. Markman said that for now, a patient's best option is to ask whether her doctor offers the treatment, and if the answer is no, to find a doctor who does. Some experts say that the ability to offer abdominal chemotherapy for ovarian cancer should be added to the list of basic ""quality measures"" -- such as making sure all heart attack patients receive certain drugs -- that Medicare and other payers use to evaluate hospital performance. A study published on Monday in The Journal of Clinical Oncology looked at the use of the abdominal treatment, known as intraperitoneal, or IP, treatment at six cancer hospitals from 2003 to 2012, and at patient survival rates. The six hospitals were all members of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, an alliance of 26 cancer centers that calls itself ""the arbiter of high quality cancer care"" and creates widely used practice guidelines for cancer treatment, which include the use of IP.

But even at these elite centers, IP treatment did not take off as much as experts thought it should. From 2003 to 2006, as research began showing it had benefits, overall use of the treatment rose from zero to 33 percent of patients. From 2007 to 2008 -- after the major, landmark study and the alert from the cancer institute -- the use rose to 50 percent of eligible patients. But then it reached a plateau. Rates varied from one hospital to the next, with 4 percent to 67 percent of patients receiving IP treatment. Researchers say that at smaller, less prestigious hospitals, the rates are even worse. The hospitals that participated in the study were named in the journal article, but their individual rates were not disclosed. ""We suspected that even at the best centers there would be low integration of IP chemotherapy, but we were surprised to see how low it was across academic centers, and also to see how much variation there was between centers,"" said Dr. Alexi A. Wright, the first author of the study and a medical oncologist at the Dana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center in Boston. ""It's the best data we have for improving survival among patients with this cancer."" Deborah Dennehy, 58, a second-grade teacher from Amesbury, Mass., had IP treatment two years ago at Dana-Farber. She said she gained as much as 10 pounds with each treatment from all the fluid infused, and felt like a ""beached whale"" for a few days afterward. She lost her hair and temporarily had some numbing in her fingertips from the chemotherapy, but medication prevented nausea. Now, she said, ""I feel great."" And given the data on the treatment, she said, ""I felt it was totally worth the inconvenience."" The new study confirmed earlier findings that IP treatment helps women live longer. Among women who had IP treatment, 81 percent were still alive three years later, compared with 71 percent in women who had only intravenous chemotherapy. The findings are based on the records of about 500 women. Another study, also published in The Journal of Clinical Oncology, in May, found that the benefits of IP therapy are long-lasting: among women followed for 10 years, the risk of death was 23 percent less in those who had IP therapy.

Ovarian cancer is usually not found until it has reached Stage 3, when it has begun to spread inside the abdomen. Studies find that two factors have the greatest impact on survival: removing every visible trace of the tumor with meticulous ""debulking"" surgery, and finishing the recommended amount of chemotherapy. Studies have found that many women do not have adequate surgery, because they are operated on by doctors who do not specialize in gynecologic cancer. IP treatment requires that a port be surgically implanted in the abdominal wall so that the drugs can be infused. At many centers, the patients are rolled back and forth on a bed to slosh the chemotherapy around inside them. The treatment is thought to work so well because it essentially soaks any cancer cells that remain after surgery in a highly concentrated bath of cancer-killing drugs. Dr. Wright said her study was the first to analyze outcomes from IP treatment that was given as part of regular medical practice, and not part of a clinical trial. The results are important because doctors sometimes worry that findings from clinical trials will not hold up in routine medical practice because patients in the trials are carefully selected and may be healthier, more rigorously monitored and given more help with side effects than those in real-world oncology practices. In this case, Dr. Wright said, the survival benefit proved that women do not have to be in a clinical trial to benefit from IP treatment, and that it can be given successfully in more ordinary settings. Her study also addressed another concern that some oncologists have raised -- the toxicity of IP treatment, which had led some women in the clinical trial to stop treatment without finishing it. In Dr. Wright's study, side effects were less severe and the rates of completing treatment were similar: 89 percent of women who received IP treatment finished the planned course, compared with 91 percent who received only intravenous treatment. Dr. Deborah K. Armstrong, a professor at Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center, and the leader of the 2006 study that proved the large survival benefit, attributed the failure of the therapy to catch on to reluctance by oncologists, especially senior ones who might influence colleagues. She said the cumulative data are so strong that oncologists have ""no more excuses"" for disregarding it. But to bring about change, patients will have to speak up, she said, adding: ""I think it's going to have to be the advocate community, since they're the ones who have the most skin in the game, and can put the money where the mouth is, and say, 'If you can't give me the best treatment I'll go someplace else.' ""","The treatment, known as IP, in which chemotherapy is pumped directly into the abdomen, could add 16 months or more to women's lives, researchers say.",ebddfbf7-562a-56a5-a593-ab22d0c422f9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/04/science/04ovary/04ovary-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=4320819df6cc58a6413ed081d3450aad5f8c0421bbcc45d4faeafbdfa86d9636&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Deborah Denehy received chemotherapy directly to her abdomen to treat ovarian cancer, a treatment that remains underused in the United States.",ebddfbf7-562a-56a5-a593-ab22d0c422f9,N24News/imgs/ebddfbf7-562a-56a5-a593-ab22d0c422f9.jpg,1
Technology,Amazon Said to Be Under Scrutiny in 2 States for Abuse of Power,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/technology/state-inquiry-antitrust-amazon.html,"SEATTLE -- State investigators in California and Washington have been looking into whether Amazon abuses its power over sellers on the tech giant's site, according to people involved with the inquiry.

In the last several months, California has asked about the company's private label products and whether it uses data from sellers to inform which products it sells, according to two people, who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution by the company.

The Washington attorney general's office has also been interested in whether Amazon makes it harder for sellers to list their products on other websites, according to correspondence viewed by The New York Times.

The people said that the inquiries did not appear to be in advanced stages.

The interest in Amazon's lucrative marketplace is a signal that scrutiny of the company is widening, including criticism of the working conditions in its warehouses and accusations that it boxes out small business and competitors. Liberal politicians have singled out the company and its founder, Jeff Bezos, the wealthiest person in the world, as examples of out-of-control corporate power.",Inquiries in California and Washington are a sign that the scrutiny of the tech giant continues to intensify.,5e2f4a29-a0f6-562f-bb30-f0862d108bdb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/12/business/12antitrust/12antitrust-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=8aafea8d2ad57c70d4f52f68b6aa91f661e4e38a0f34bc547d741c97b3025630&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Amazon is among several tech giants facing antitrust investigations into its market power.,5e2f4a29-a0f6-562f-bb30-f0862d108bdb,N24News/imgs/5e2f4a29-a0f6-562f-bb30-f0862d108bdb.jpg,20
Movies,"Animated Movies Give Women More Leadership Roles, Study Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/movies/animated-movies-women.html,"The movie business has been famously tough on women, who have found themselves excluded from key roles throughout the decision-making and creative processes.

But in parts of the animation industry, women have thrived. Women hold half of the leadership positions at the major film animation companies, new research has found. And, of the top 120 animated films over the last dozen years, nearly four in 10 had female producers, which is more than double the number of women who produced live-action films in that time.

Still, the study, released by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative at the University of Southern California, showed a mixed bag, especially for women of color, who accounted for just 5 percent of producers on those top animated films.

Women also remained the minority in a slew of key roles elsewhere in animation.

As cherished as such animated characters as Moana, Elsa (""Frozen"") and Judy Hopps (""Zootopia"") are, they are also rarities. Less than a fifth -- 17 percent -- of the 120 top animated movies from 2007 to 2018 had female leads.","Nearly four in 10 of the top toons had female producers, but women of color still found it hard to get a foothold.",b7aa7f1d-777d-5787-b080-21c44bb8a5b9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/10/arts/10animation-item2/10animation-item2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=e429b90884a15ea9eed269eb6ce090fbf4d270e8d8d7459b3553e31ff1b08280&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Moana was among the 17 percent of lead female characters in top animated films.,b7aa7f1d-777d-5787-b080-21c44bb8a5b9,N24News/imgs/b7aa7f1d-777d-5787-b080-21c44bb8a5b9.jpg,5
Style,"Julia Fox, Diamond in the Rough of 'Uncut Gems'",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/09/style/julia-fox-uncut-gems.html,"Going up? Strolling old haunts in the East Village neighborhood of New York City.



Julia Fox's progression from downtown Manhattan persona to actress in the new Adam Sandler movie ""Uncut Gems"" might sound like an impressive run of luck. Ms. Fox, 29, says she manifested the entire thing. Manifestation, she reminded while waiting in line at the East Village pastry shop Veniero's on a Sunday afternoon last month, is when something that you say will happen, happens. Like the time two years ago when Ms. Fox and her best friend went on a road trip to the desert looking to participate in a peyote ceremony with the first spirit guide they encountered. The guide, they stipulated, had to be a woman. After several hours of driving around the Navajo Nation reservation at the border of Arizona and New Mexico with no leads, tripping lightly on mushrooms, and nearly ready to call off the search, Ms. Fox declared that not only were the pair going to find their female shaman, she'd be waiting for them.

Ms. Fox paused for dramatic effect against the chatter of customers anxiously awaiting their Italian pastry. ""And the woman said: 'For you.'"" Did this really happen? Maybe that matters less than the fact that Ms. Fox sees her whole life as playing out under the terms of a self-willed destiny. And that at this juncture, tapping at a glass case of ricotta cannoli in the bakery where she once worked for a brief spell in high school, that destiny appears both inexplicable and inevitable. Or at least: she's just signed with a Hollywood agent. Directed by Josh and Benny Safdie, ""Uncut Gems"" takes place in Manhattan's diamond district circa 2012, a strange moment in time when The Weeknd (who has a small cameo in the film) was a budding superstar and Apple's iPhone 5 was a signifier of financial excess. The story follows an erratic, Gucci-wearing jewelry dealer named Howard Ratner (Mr. Sandler) whose compulsive gambling habits create comic misery for those around him. Ms. Fox plays the part of Howard's high-dollar showroom saleswoman and mistress, who also happens to be named Julia.

Many involved with the film, along with most of Ms. Fox's friends, insist that the Julia of the film is based intimately on Julia Fox, with the same habits, energy, tendency to ""always have a scandal,"" as she put it, and even style. ""She is that real New York City girl that this film needed,"" said Miyako Bellizi, the film's costume designer and a longtime friend of Ms. Fox's. ""She deserves a lot of credit for the film, especially the look for it. Everyone's been asking me about Howard, and it's like, 'but what about Julia?'"" Ms. Fox was born in Italy, but raised in Yorkville, an Upper East Side neighborhood east of the posher Park Avenue. Girls from this neighborhood, Ms. Fox said, can be summed up as such: ""Cute. Doesn't look like a mess but actually is a mess. Always carrying a nice bag, but no money in it."" And: ""Not to be messed with,"" she said, using a more vulgar word, ""but we look nice, and we sound like we're from Long Island."" Like the onscreen Julia, Ms. Fox is a no-nonsense city girl, unguarded lover, valuable henchwoman, and worthy sparring partner with a fondness for brightly colored Versace and of course, diamonds. (She wore $300,000 worth from TraxNYC, a 47th Street jeweler whose owner also has a role, to the film's New York premiere.)

In one of the more brilliant sequences of ""Uncut Gems,"" Ms. Fox and Mr. Sandler's characters have a couple's brawl set off by Howard's bullish jealousy outside of the nightclub 1 Oak. In a single tracking shot that runs down West 17th Street, the pair howls profanities at each other like a blacked-out couple on spring break. As Mr. Sandler's character attempts to escape in a cab, Julia throws herself in front of the moving vehicle, twice, before giving up the chase with a defeated, and elongated, four-letter word. ""I mean, that's Julia,"" said Briana Andalore, one of Ms. Fox's closest friends. The pair met over a decade ago at a party in the East Village, to which Ms. Fox arrived with a cat in her arms. ""I don't know even know how to say it other than, that is her. We've had those moments. We've actually been outside of 1 Oak, screaming at a car. It's like the time we once stopped to yell at my stepdad's car in the middle of Bleecker Street.""

The Safdie brothers encountered Ms. Fox at Jack's Wife Freda, a cafe in SoHo (shades of Lana Turner at Schwab's). Josh Safdie said any similarities between her and the character were purely coincidental, at first. Then he let her read the script. ""When she finished, Julia asked me if I had been spying on her because she thought that there were so many strange similarities with the character,"" Mr. Safdie said. ""But she gave me good feedback, so I would call her on a whim when I had writer's block, and I would ask her for advice. The character was just kind of constantly evolving to become more specific to her.""

Before her film debut, depending on whom you ask, Ms. Fox could have been described as a clothing designer (she ran a knitwear brand with Ms. Andalore) or as a model, having posed for Playboy's ""last"" nude issue in 2015. Others still might know her best as a sporadically exhibiting painter and photographer. In a 2017 gallery show, ""R.I.P. Julia Fox"" she claimed to have used her own blood as paint for her canvases. She has published two books of photography that quickly became cult items on the independent book fairs circuit. Ms. Fox could be called an activist, too, having driven a carful of supplies to the Standing Rock tribe's 2016 protests of the Dakota Access pipeline and helping clean up afterward. ""I remember stumbling into her universe through a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend,"" Josh Safdie said. ""And at first, you couldn't quite figure out the type of person that she was, and it was very, very alluring. It was exciting. She was constantly redefining who you thought you were talking to."" Richie Shazam, a longtime friend of Ms. Fox's and a photographer who curated her 2016 exhibition, ""PTSD,"" said: ""Julia's able to be, like, this scientist who's able to experiment with all the ways she envisions beauty in her brain. Through her stimulation, she's able to concoct all of these different products that can be euphoric or completely dark and dystopian."" The photos were taken during a period in which Ms. Fox briefly lived in New Orleans, and document a tempestuous relationship in harshly lit scenes where drug use, blood, and sex is paired with tranquil suburban landscapes, like a white cat crossing a street. ""She has this way of creating a synergy between the two, which is very mystifying to me, because so few people can do that so well.""

""It was fantasy role play. I'd have one minute before a session. They'd give you a piece of paper with the guy's info. 'O.K., he wants me to be like his angry mother. Got it. Boom.' And, you've got two seconds to get in that mind-set."" Ms. Fox added: ""I went in there insecure and with low self-worth. I didn't understand my value. I left with too much self-esteem. Nobody was going to ever cross me again."" Sometimes a listener might wonder if Ms. Fox is exaggerating, especially when she is offering her story in quick summary, as she did earlier that day at Lucien, a bistro and longtime haunt of hers. Before she could take off her fur-lined leather coat, she was greeted by two of the three diners sitting inside the virtually empty restaurant. ""I'm not going to lie, I woke up at noon, and I was like, 'I'm going to have to shower and plan an outfit.' So, this is what you guys got,"" Ms. Fox said, glancing down at her sheer silver top. She ordered cauliflower soup and, festively, oysters, It was her one-year anniversary of marriage to Peter Artemiev, who works in private aviation in Brighton Beach, and whom she met through Lucien's proprietor, Zac Bahaj. ""We actually both forgot because I got one of those alerts on my phone."" She said she manifested him, too. (""Like ticking off boxes on a checklist, he was everything I said I wanted."") Two months later, they were married. Ms. Fox wasn't a lock for the role she had shaped. The addition of Mr. Sandler and the powerful producer Scott Rudin to the project meant that beyond manifesting her acting career, she'd also had to earn it with a screen test. ""Pretty much every single girl in New York auditioned for the role of Julia,"" Ms. Fox said -- around 200 by the Safdies' count, and some very well-known. ""And they all knew that it was my role. It was so awkward to run into these girls: 'Hey, I think I just auditioned for this movie that's based on you.' They thought it was a movie about my life.""",The role of a young lifetime: oneself.,e78743cd-dfbe-5b59-89d0-e77c958762eb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/08/fashion/08JULIAFOX2/08JULIAFOX2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=7e7fa68f53620c192287a942185229f17b4eca88605aaab67de0a849a951c3ea&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Blooming: Ms. Fox mid-sentence at Lucien, a restaurant.",e78743cd-dfbe-5b59-89d0-e77c958762eb,N24News/imgs/e78743cd-dfbe-5b59-89d0-e77c958762eb.jpg,15
Music,Holly Humberstone Wants Her Songs to Last a Lifetime,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/arts/music/holly-humberstone-falling-asleep-at-the-wheel.html,"When the singer and songwriter Holly Humberstone began working with the writer and producer Rob Milton on her debut EP, they quickly arrived at a shorthand for the kinds of lyrics they were aiming for. ""When we write together, we're like, we need to make these lyrics really very personal and heartbreaking. Like they have to be lyrics that someone would get tattooed on their skin for life,"" she said in an interview last month. ""If they're not tattoo lyrics, then they don't make the record."" What they land on, in song after song, is a striking blend of offhand conversation and acutely detailed storytelling, verses that feel like whispers into the ear of an intimate.

""You never smoked this much before we met/Light up, light up another cigarette,"" she laments at the beginning of the ethereal ""Falling Asleep at the Wheel,"" a song that begins as an indictment of a partner before the scrutiny turns inward: ""I can tell you're drinking only to forget/Don't know how I got you in such a mess.""

Humberstone, 20, will release her debut EP, also called ""Falling Asleep at the Wheel,"" on Friday -- it's an absorbing affair. Her lovely voice is fluttery and precise, and also oozy, hanging over her songs like low, enveloping fog. And while she sings with pop-soul swing, her music, full of haunted piano and parched indie rock guitar, has gravity and stickiness. ""I'm still trying to figure out what kind of genre I am, to be honest,"" she said, speaking over Zoom from her family's home in the countryside outside Grantham, in England's East Midlands. She'd been holed up there since the beginning of the pandemic, right after she finished opening on tour for the Scottish pop crooner Lewis Capaldi. Spiritually, she's in the tradition of recent stars like Lorde and Billie Eilish, who have extremely sturdy pop savvy but whose emotional interests are complicated and sometimes gloomy, and whose music blurs aesthetics borrowed from rock, dance music and beyond. What unites Humberstone's songs, though, is a heavy emotional ballast, making for an almost physical warmth. That's true when she's writing about relationships, like on the title track, which even though it shifts from piano march to dance thump, is actually a ""dance song for people who don't bother going out,"" Milton joked. On ""Livewire,"" about how nothing gold can stay, Humberstone sings with an almost hymnal reverence: ""Maybe we took things just one little step too far/Coming home late and waking your neighbors/At least there'll be no more destruction now we're apart.""

The cocoon-like ""Deep End"" is about a challenging stretch Humberstone's younger sister was enduring. ""I find it really hard to get words out and some things get jumbled between my brain and coming out of my mouth,"" Humberstone said. ""For some reason if I put something in a song, it's such a simple format and I can just say what I really struggled to say."" Humberstone is the third youngest of four sisters. Her parents are doctors with Britain's National Health Service, and both passed down creative passions: her mother played cello in a youth orchestra, and her father kept a cabinet full of poetry books that Humberstone would peruse and sometimes accompany with music. As a teenager, Humberstone played violin, unhappily, in the Lincolnshire Youth Symphony Orchestra. When she was around 16, she uploaded demos she made with GarageBand on her father's Mac to the BBC Music Introducing website, a talent discovery vehicle. That led to one of them -- ""Hit and Run,"" inspired by the movie ""Baby Driver"" -- being played on local radio, which led to meeting her manager. After high school, she spent a year at a performing arts college in Liverpool before dropping out to move back home. By that time, though, she was already beginning to work on her own music, commuting to London for her burgeoning career.

""She has this ability to write pop songs, but that's not necessarily what she wants to make,"" Milton said in a phone interview. ""She just was desperate not to write obvious lyrics."" For songwriting, she's partial to the detailed approach of the indie singer and songwriter Phoebe Bridgers; in quarantine, Humberstone said, the release of Bridgers's latest album ""Punisher"" ""literally saved me."" And Humberstone gravitates toward musicians like Bon Iver, Frank Ocean and James Blake, who slather their intuitive melodies under layers of abstraction. Milton said that they listened to a lot of Elliott Smith and Simon & Garfunkel, drawn to the thickness of the vocal layering -- ""a magical freaky element."" ""We detuned the guitars to fit with the melodies,"" he added. ""All the tunings of the guitars are just complete nonsense. It's some kind of Slipknot heavy metal tuning."" Rather than signing to a label, Humberstone made a deal with Platoon, an artist services company that also placed early bets on Jorja Smith and Eilish. ""I do think Holly is a lot like Billie,"" said Denzyl Feigelson, Platoon's founder, in a phone interview. ""They have a sense about them as to their mood and their emotions and how they write their songs."" During the months that Humberstone has been back at home, she's been chipping away at promotional work -- music videos, social media clips -- sometimes with her family helping out behind the scenes.","The young British singer, who writes conversationally intimate pop music, is about to release her debut EP.",e25e3447-fca9-53e0-b30c-df8eaa9c9aae,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/05/arts/05HUMBERSTONE1/05HUMBERSTONE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a7396474a0d9402073452ff7d1b3695a8a9edbd65e1792136bd4885e4329342a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The singer and songwriter Holly Humberstone says she aims to write ""lyrics that someone would get tattooed on their skin for life.""",e25e3447-fca9-53e0-b30c-df8eaa9c9aae,N24News/imgs/e25e3447-fca9-53e0-b30c-df8eaa9c9aae.jpg,12
Real Estate,How Sticker Shock Led to a Sale,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/realestate/from-hawaii-to-a-chelsea-studio.html,"For the first of her four years at Parsons the New School for Design, Sabrina Banta lived in a siren-tormented dorm on East 15th Street near a hospital. She later moved to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, for three years, sharing two different light-deprived rentals with several roommates. The commute between Williamsburg and school or internship -- she had a total of five internships during her photography studies -- took its toll. If she didn't have to awaken early and be on site at 6 a.m., she braved the L train, so jammed during the morning rush that she often let several trains pass before shoving her way in. With assorted retail, restaurant, babysitting and freelance jobs, she found herself constantly on the run. When she graduated in the spring, her family flew out from Honolulu, where Ms. Banta, now 21, grew up. After the commencement, her father, Norman Banta, returned home with her brother, while her mother, Liza Nordin, remained for a few weeks to help her figure out where to live.

""We knew we had to do something about permanent housing, because we knew she was not coming back to Hawaii,"" Ms. Nordin said. ""She was spending an obscene amount of money on cabs because she was always running late."" WEST 72ND STREET A studio in the Bancroft, a large prewar building, took one-room living a bit far for the prospective buyer's taste. Ms. Banta's parents are both real estate agents in Hawaii, yet they were shocked at New York's tiny studios, high prices and unheard-of broker fees. A rental budget of $2,000 a month didn't go far. ""We were just horrified,"" Ms. Nordin said. For a similar monthly cost, they could buy a nicer place. So Ms. Banta and her mother went on the hunt for a studio co-op costing up to $300,000. They found candidates like a rectangular room in a large prewar elevator building on West 72nd Street near Central Park West. At just under $300,000, with monthly maintenance in the mid-$800s, the place was more of an eat-in bedroom than an apartment. Ms. Banta found it ""kind of scary"" that for a moment she actually thought, ""I could live here."" (It sold for $285,000.) A $269,000 studio on East 18th Street was in contract when they saw the listing, but the ad connected them with an agent, Angela Britzman of Bond New York.

WEST 34th STREET Another studio was a possibility, but it was near the Hudson Yards development, still a long way from completion. They soon arrived at a studio with a loft sleeping area in a five-story walk-up in Chelsea. The price was $299,000, with monthly maintenance of $500. The 450-square-foot studio was in good shape, with high ceilings, an exposed brick wall, a large closet and a quiet back view. A partial wall separated the kitchen from the living/bedroom. Ms. Banta climbed into the loft. ""When you know, you know,"" she said. ""I loved the way the apartment felt to me. I didn't want to see anything else. There was something so comforting about it."" The studio was in a small, self-managed building in a Housing Development Fund Corporation co-op with a household income restriction of around $50,000 a year. But the building also required a down payment of at least 50 percent. ""I've never heard of such a thing,"" Ms. Nordin said. ""It's just weird. If you're young, where are you going to get the money to put down, unless a parent or somebody is helping you?"" WEST 85TH STREET The open house for a studio in a small walk-up was a mob scene. But why join the fray when downtown is where you want to be? But the family fit that narrow category. ""We were in a position to help Sabrina and believe this is an investment in her, because I want her to be settled and safe and start her career,"" Ms. Nordin said. ""I am 5,000 miles away.""

The family put in an offer. But because of the financial requirements, ""I thought we had to have some backup,"" Ms. Britzman said. She lined up other places to see. Ms. Banta, busy with work, had no time. So her mother went ""and ruled them out for me,"" she said. Madison Gardens, a small postwar elevator building on far West 34th Street, had a rectangular studio, over budget at $399,000, with monthly maintenance of around $600. Ms. Nordin thought the place was nice, but decided the nearby Hudson Yards area ""was very industrial and had no neighborhood feeling."" On West 85th Street, Ms. Nordin saw a cute renovated studio with a loft on the ground floor of a small walk-up. The price was nearly $300,000, with monthly maintenance in the low $600s. CHELSEA A studio in an income-restricted prewar building in the West 20s seemed to have the buyer's name on it. The open house was crowded, and ""it seemed like it was going to go really fast,"" Ms. Britzman said. And Ms. Banta preferred to remain downtown, on familiar turf. (Both it and the Madison Gardens studio are now in contract.) Meanwhile, the application for the Chelsea studio went forward. ""That was a steep learning curve. It was very nerve-racking and stressful,"" Ms. Nordin said. She even blogged about it for her Hawaii readers. The family bought the studio for $294,000. ""Sabrina fit the profile of the building, and it was love at first sight,"" said Neil Tilbury of Halstead Property, the selling agent. ""For her, it was a rare opportunity to find something downtown in a lower price range.""","Sabrina Banta, a recent college graduate, bought a studio with help from a housing program and her family.",e860f6a1-8b1e-525d-bfe5-12770ff63f2e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/07/realestate/07HUNT-MAIN/07HUNT-MAIN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=37dfa54edff432d4e6d6c95c1ffd6117876d5b6979cce0a1857420d94efc8eb1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,THE BUYER Sabrina Banta removed a sleeping loft after she moved into her new studio.,e860f6a1-8b1e-525d-bfe5-12770ff63f2e,N24News/imgs/e860f6a1-8b1e-525d-bfe5-12770ff63f2e.jpg,7
Art & Design,My Bill Viola Video Marathon,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/arts/design/bill-viola-barnes-video.html,"A scene from Bill Viola's ""Ascension"" (2000) in the exhibition ""I Do Not Know What It Is I Am Like: The Art of Bill Viola,"" at the Barnes Foundation.



PHILADELPHIA -- When rereading a classic novel many years after college, one finds that greater maturity often deepens the experience, bringing more insight into the author's objective. Recently, I had a similar reaction in viewing 10 videos of varying length, several for the second time, by the artist Bill Viola during a daylong marathon among three museums here. Engrossed in the humanistic spiritualism that permeates Mr. Viola's work, blended with his idiosyncratic imagination about the activities of daily life, I emerged with a fresh understanding of how his representation of a singular instance stands for a timeless worldview of both people and nature. Mr. Viola, 68, a New Yorker by birth and Californian since 1980, now lives in Long Beach with his wife and collaborator, Kira Perov. Coming from what he calls a TV childhood, he discovered video in 1969 when someone staged a video camera in his high school classroom. When he arrived at Syracuse University, he immediately signed up for the video workshop and has been experimenting and developing new techniques ever since in what was then a nascent art. [Read about exhibitions in the Hudson Valley, north of New York City.] In paving the way for video innovation, he has produced challenging art works based on medical imaging technologies of the human body and animal behavior as well as scripted moving scenarios filmed with performers. As proof that video is now mainstream in the art world, all four of the finalists on view for the 2018 Turner Prize, sponsored by Tate Britain, were practitioners of video art with digitally driven, hyper-political themes.

Often museums may show a few Viola videos at onetime, but here the Barnes Foundation takes the lead in an exhibition of eight videos, titled ""I Do Not Know What It Is I Am Like,"" curated with a catalog by John G. Hanhardt and other writers. Both the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the Fabric Workshop and Museum around the corner joined in with one video each from their permanent collections. Together the works span the years 1976 to 2009.

When I walked into the gallery at the Pennsylvania Academy to see ""Ocean Without a Shore,"" I was immediately taken back to that hot day in 2007 at the Venice Biennale when I stood in line in the campo outside the 15th-century Church of San Gallo to see it for the first time. Inside, screens were recessed above three ornate altars, and the videos were synchronized at different stages. In each, a person seen in grainy black and white would come from a distance and break through a sheet of transparent water emerging in full color expressing fear, anguish or joy . (His innovative use of new technologies includes a water wall, a laser-cut, razor-precise edge that creates a sheet of water that looked like glass.) I have learned since that Mr. Viola was assigned this space and created the video of the dead coming back temporarily to our world. He deemed the altars as a cross between tombs and places to pray. Unfortunately, in that crowded space no one could stay for long. How fortunate then to enter its present space arranged in the same configuration, with the suggestion of the altars. Here I saw the entire sequence representing people of many ethnic and cultural backgrounds exploring, in the artist's words, ""the fragility of the border between life and death.""

The sequence had a rhythm to it broken by the different personalities and expressions, until a young girl, seen as a shadow, puts her hand through the water and then turns back, the only one not to break through. This powerful moment, which I missed the first time, immediately reminded me of Emily in Thornton Wilder's ""Our Town,"" who returns painfully to a day in her life. Mr. Viola is influenced by mystic religions; the title comes from the Andalusian Sufi Ibn Arabi: ""The Self is an ocean without a shore. Gazing upon it has no beginning or end, in this world and the next."" ""The Veiling,"" at the Fabric Workshop, where Mr. Viola was artist in residence in the early 1990s, was also first shown at a Venice Biennale (1995), one of five video and sound installations that he created to occupy the five rooms of the United States Pavilion. Nine parallel scrims of sheer Italian curtain cloth serve as continuous screens for a slow-motion episode of a man and woman meeting and separating in a nocturnal woodland scene, with projections coming from both ends. Its ethereal quality captures the viewer's own imagination almost as a participant. Still it was sometimes difficult to focus on images between the slightly waving sheets. Among t he artist's myriad technological feats, slow motion is one feature that draws attention to dramatic details that would be missed if shown in real time. Moving to the Barnes, this was most evident in ""The Greeting"" inspired by the Mannerist painting ""The Visitation"" (circa 1528-29) by Jacopo da Pontormo that serves as the altarpiece for a church in Carmignano, Italy. After seeing it on loan last year at the Morgan Library & Museum, I was captured here not only by the elegance of Mr. Viola's scene, with its expressions of anticipation and fulfillment, but by the setting of similar Italianate buildings with mysterious characters in the background and, above all, the draping and flow of fabrics that conveyed the original without losing the modernity of, say, shoulder bags on the present performers.

In a simple room based on a nun's cell, the performer, Weba Garretson, goes about her daily routine -- yoga in the morning, sewing at midday, writing with frustration in the afternoon, a ritualistic lighting of candles at night, and finally preparing for bed. But the singular window in each panel enlarges the story with a view of a tree passing through the seasons. Here on first take, it seemed to me a whole life lived ending in death, and I succumbed to what I call the dollhouse theory of seeing myself in the interior and living the experience. It was sobering to feel life fleeting by. Finally, there is Mr. Viola's fascination with water. He has often spoken of his discovery of a magical underwater world in a near-drowning accident at age 6. In the film, ""I Do Not Know What It Is I Am Like,"" the enigmatic title drawn from the Rig-Veda, the opening sequence conveys this sensation. Completed in 1986, after three years of recording and editing, it is both a surreal and specific rendering of the fragility and intermingling of animal and human life, from extreme close-ups of birds in zoos and of underground caves to a fire-walking ceremony in a Hindu community in Fiji. As he zeros in on the eye of an owl, suddenly I could see the artist reflected in its black pupil. By the end of the marathon, I had had an illuminating encounter with life, death and consciousness through Bill Viola's own experimental and farseeing eye.

Travel,"Have Work, Will Travel",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/travel/travel-temporary-jobs.html,"Tim Justice took a cross-country road trip and earned $2,000 along the way by making pickups and drop-offs for a delivery service. ""I was itching to do a road trip,"" said Mr. Justice, 41, a Phoenix-based flight attendant. ""Forget getting on a plane if I don't have to."" Mr. Justice's trip, which was funded by work he picked up on Roadie, an app that coordinates drivers and people or businesses looking to ship items, is just one example of how people with flexible day jobs and a little know-how can stretch their travel dollars by joining the gig economy. The proliferation of apps and websites that aim to link employers with temporary workers has only made things easier. Some jobs require specific skills, such as bartending at a music festival or teaching snowboarding. But other opportunities only require good timing.

Mr. Justice had already done some deliveries for Roadie, so he kept an eye open for long-distance gigs. He jumped at one that offered $1,200 to transport a bonsai tree and a dozen other houseplants from Los Angeles to New York City. Then he found another he could tack on, delivering a vintage garden windmill from Akron, Ohio, to Atlanta for $300. He got an unexpected $500 tip from the plants' owner when he delivered them healthy and three days ahead of schedule. Mr. Justice and an unemployed friend traveled 6,200 miles in a week, doing tag-team driving. The money he made covered his costs, he said, and he had a great time ""on the open road with good company and good laughs."" Here are some other ways for United States residents to mix work with travel without having to worry about a working visa for a foreign country. Music festivals and other temporary events need a lot of low-wage workers. And though you might spend a good part of your time tending bar or being a cashier, you can still take part. The Music Festival Wizard website offers a list of events , and you can check the individual festival sites for job postings if a location is appealing.

Another good place to look is the Indeed.com job board, where a recent search for the word ""festival"" turned up an assortment of positions, including bartending at the Under the Big Sky Music Festival, July 13 to 14, in Whitefish, Mont. ($10 an hour). Applicants need to have a Montana alcohol-serving certificate, which can be obtained online. Workers were also needed for retail sales at the Musikfest in Bethlehem, Pa., with dates for training, the event and teardown stretching from July 16 to Aug. 18 (pay not specified); and as scorekeepers for two-day Lacrosse America tournaments near Chicago July 13 -- 14 and Madison, Wis., July 20 -- 21 ($10 an hour). A two-day music festival in Butler, Ohio, was offering $13 to $15 an hour for workers to move boxes, put on wristbands, handle crowd flow, and scan tickets and parking passes. The festival isn't named in the posting, but organizers of the E.S.T. Fest, which runs Aug. 2 to 3, confirmed the listing.

For higher paying positions at music festivals, arena events, fashion shows and cruise ships, those with medical training might apply to ParaDocs Worldwide. Emergency medical technicians, paramedics, nurses and emergency room doctors need to be licensed in the same state as the event. They get an hourly wage and virtually all expenses are paid. The days can be long, and partying on the job isn't allowed. But while ""the music festivals are super busy, sometimes you can be placed right in the pit,"" Alex Pollak, ParaDocs' founder and a trained paramedic, said in an telephone interview from Pryor, Okla., where he was working the Rocklahoma festival. Many years ago, my friend and I applied to an agency to work as vacation nannies over winter break. I was placed with a family that stayed home. My friend, on the other hand, got to go on a family ski vacation to Val d'Isere, in the French Alps. Susan McCloskey, owner of Nanny Poppinz, a nationwide agency that places nannies with at least three years of experience, said opportunities to travel still exist. In general, the employee should get about $20 per hour, a travel bonus of $50 to $100 per day and expenses, she said. The nanny should also negotiate for some time off.

""Most of the big ski resorts are pretty much always hiring. they are never at full employment,"" said Dave Belin, a market research consultant for the Professional Ski Instructors of America and the American Association of Snowboard Instructors (PSIA-AASI). Vail Resorts has a ""holiday help"" tab in its job pull-down menu. A job as a rental technician at Breckenridge Resort in Colorado has a minimum 10-day commitment, while teaching as a ski instructor at Colorado's Beaver Creek Resort requires at least 15 days of work during peak periods, plus training days. ""We have some instructors that will come out and spend spring break with us and complete all 15 days of teaching during that period,"" said Greg Willis, the senior director of Beaver Creek's Skier Services. Sometimes, businesses need an item ASAP, and so they turn to an air courier to get it hand-delivered.

One company, Airmule, pays $150 to travelers with a visa for China who are willing to ""sell"" a luggage slot on their flight there from the United States, or on a flight to India, Thailand or South Korea that stops in China. (Flights back to the United States pay $100.) There are downsides, however: Couriers need to be at the airport up to three hours ahead of their flights, and they have to pay any baggage fees for the Airmule luggage, as well as their own. They also need to pay any duty that might be charged on the items they are carrying in advance. (The company advertises it will reimburse any duty as long as the courier submits the paperwork.) It's unclear what sort of support the company offers. Several calls weeks apart to the customer service number during advertised business hours only reached voice mail. Sean Yang, the founder, responded to an email requesting comment, saying he was traveling and didn't have time for an interview. Still, a few bloggers who have tried Airmule have given it generally good reviews. Though one did note that a certain amount of trust is involved. Another well-established air courier, Chapman Freeborn OBC (On Board Courier), addresses many of the Airmule shortfalls, but has its own limitations. OBC books and pays for an economy plane ticket, as well as any luggage fees. It also pays a daily sum to the courier, and it has customs brokers to help at the destination, though the process can still take many hours, said Mr. Nikolai Bergmann, director of the OBC program. It's not for the casual traveler, however. The company chooses the destination and the flights, and usually gives couriers only a few hours' notice of a job. And it's generally a quick out and back, even on international flights. ""You really need to be an aviation nerd. You need to love airports and flying in order to enjoy this kind of work,"" Mr. Bergmann said.

Travelers who want to pick up some shifts and potentially meet locals might look to Wonolo (Work. Now. Locally.), which offers access to on-demand jobs in about a dozen cities in the United States through its app. Positions might include event staffing, brand ambassadors, catering, theme park work, sales and warehouse fulfillment, among others. Job seekers download the app, then create a profile and answer questions related to location (which can be updated while on vacation), and preferred payment method. A background check is required before the user can start signing up for jobs, so initial approval can take a few days. Those willing to commit to at least a few weeks can find seasonal jobs at resorts and parks at CoolWorks, a website whose slogan is ""jobs in great places."" Current postings include jobs in Grand Canyon National Park, where Bright Angels Bicycles and Cafe needs a bike mechanic, shuttle van drivers, a barista, bike tour guides and more through Nov. 1. An Alaskan adventure can be had with Allen Marine Tours, which runs day cruises in Juneau, Ketchikan, Sitka and Glacier Bay through the fall. In Yellowstone National Park, some lodges are looking for people to work part time for five weeks in September and early October. ""The low unemployment rate has created a very competitive work environment, with a smaller pool of candidates interested in seasonal work,"" said Rick Hoeninghausen, director of sales and marketing for the lodges, which are part of the Xanterra Travel Collection.

Several park properties, including the Lake Yellowstone Hotel and the Old Faithful Inn, are hiring people to work during the shoulder season, after college students have returned to school, as part of Xanterra's ""Helping Hands"" program. It requires a minimum of 20 hours per week at a starting wage of $10.10 per hour for duties such as light housekeeping, kitchen prep, busing tables or washing dishes, usually for four to eight hours per day. Employees live in the park in basic dorm rooms that generally have two to three people per room, and shared or private baths. The cost of the accommodation and cafeteria-style meals are subsidized based on hours worked, but typically average about $45 per week. Participants also receive complimentary uniforms, laundry, parking, a park entrance pass and free park tours when space is available. Erica Brown, 62, a retired dental hygienist from Atlanta, worked last year at Yellowstone's Lake Lodge Cabins and the Lake Yellowstone Hotel. She said some of the jobs were physically demanding, but she loved getting to meet people from around the world, and having a chance to photograph the scenery and wildlife. ""The best part was the opportunity to live in one of earth's most amazing places for five weeks,"" she said. 52 PLACES AND MUCH, MUCH MORE Follow our 52 Places traveler, Sebastian Modak, on Instagram as he travels the world, and discover more Travel coverage by following us on Twitter and Facebook.

Art & Design,"Don't Call Her a Victim: After Surviving Opioids, Nan Goldin Goes After the Makers",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/arts/design/nan-goldin-oxycontin-addiction-opioid.html,"Nan Goldin shuddered as she recalled her anguish in early 2017 while kicking a three-year OxyContin habit. She pulled the long sleeves of her black shirt down to her wrists, then wrung her hands. ""Your own skin revolts against you,"" she said. ""Every part of yourself is in terrible pain."" The celebrated photographer was sitting in the press room of the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building, a spot that she suggested because of her love of crime dramas and, perhaps, out of a long interest in bearing witness to parts of life often relegated to the shadowy margins.

She began taking the powerful painkiller in 2014 to alleviate wrist pain and quickly became addicted, increasing her intake of pills, seeking out black market sources and finally moving to other drugs. At one point she overdosed from a mixture of heroin and fentanyl, another narcotic. Now she has been clean for a year. Ms. Goldin is still feeling her way back into a world filled with ghostly reminders of addiction, but she decided that she was strong enough for a new battle. That began recently when, in her most personal project yet, she publicly confronted OxyContin's manufacturer, Purdue Pharma, and that company's longtime owners, who are also prominent art patrons: the descendants of Mortimer and Raymond Sackler, two of three physician brothers who built Purdue Pharma into a pharmaceutical behemoth.

The January issue of Artforum published photographs by Ms. Goldin, including searing self-portraits, that depicted her life while addicted. They were accompanied by an essay in which she described her constant search for drugs: ""I went from three pills a day, as prescribed, to eighteen. I got a private endowment and spent it all. Like all opiate addicts my crippling fear of withdrawal was my guiding force."" She went on to announce the formation of an advocacy group and pressed the Sackler family and company -- who, she wrote, ""built their empire with the lives of hundreds of thousands"" -- to fund addiction treatment and education.

""I realized that I wasn't alone and that I had to help people,"" she said inside the courthouse. ""I always do what's closest to me. This is what I've lived through. And I'm a survivor of OxyContin -- talk about hell."" Elizabeth A. Sackler, the founder of a center for feminist art at the Brooklyn Museum, responded to her essay with a statement pointing out that her father, Arthur M. Sackler, who had owned Purdue Pharma with his brothers, Mortimer and Raymond, died in 1987, before OxyContin existed. (It was approved for use in 1995.) No money from the drug had gone to his descendants, she added. ""The opioid epidemic is a national crisis and Purdue Pharma's role in it is morally abhorrent to me,"" Ms. Sackler continued. ""I admire Nan Goldin's commitment to take action and her courage to tell her story.""

A spokeswoman for other members of the Sackler family did not comment. But in a statement to The New York Times, Robert Josephson, a spokesman for Purdue Pharma, said, ""We are deeply troubled by the prescription and illicit opioid abuse crisis, and we would welcome an opportunity to sit down with Ms. Goldin to discuss her ideas."" Ms. Goldin elaborated on those ideas during an evening-long interview in Lower Manhattan that began at a cafe on West Broadway and moved to the courthouse on Centre Street, its cinder block walls plastered with old tabloid covers about the accused East Village murderer Daniel Rakowitz (""The Monster of Tompkins Square"" ) and the patrician Sydney Biddle Barrows (the Mayflower Madam). ""I love this place,"" she said. ""It's the most New York place left in New York."" The conversation lasted until 10 p.m. Dinner was a Diet Pepsi, pretzels and peanut butter crackers, which Ms. Goldin selected from a courthouse vending machine.

Ms. Goldin said that her OxyContin addiction began with a prescription. In 2014, while she was living in Berlin, doctors prescribed 40 milligrams a day for tendinitis in her wrist, which later required surgery. Ms. Goldin said she ended up using 450 milligrams of the drug each day, seeking prescriptions from multiple doctors and finally turning to a dealer in New York who shipped her pills via FedEx. After years of OxyContin she moved to street drugs including heroin, which deliver a comparable high for much less money, a pattern that experts say has created the public health crisis that has terrified the nation. Ms. Goldin, who is 64, kept working throughout, even preparing a major show at the Museum of Modern Art. But she said that the drug sealed her off from the rest of the world, leaving her dulled and depressed. ""It's not a party drug. It's not a social drug."" Addiction, she said, is ""a heavy foot on your head.""

The overdose helped push her to finally confront her fear of withdrawal. She entered McLean Hospital's Fernside treatment program in rural Massachusetts, where, over two months, Ms. Goldin got clean. She began researching OxyContin and learned that Purdue's parent company had pleaded guilty in 2007 to a federal felony charge of misbranding the drug. Since then, a new federal investigation has begun and lawsuits have accused Purdue of deceptive marketing. Asked about those assertions in November, shortly after they were made, a company spokesman said, ""We vigorously deny these allegations and look forward to the opportunity to present our defense."" The deaths related to opioids, some 200,000 from 1999 to 2016, remind Ms. Goldin of H.I.V. ""In the '80s I lost a whole community and to my mind there's a generation missing,"" she said. ""So are we going to watch now while another generation is being wiped out?"" Ms. Goldin's new group, Prescription Addiction Intervention Now, or P.A.I.N. -- urged museums to reject future donations from the Sackler family. Its focus so far has been a petition on change.org demanding that ""the Sackler family and Purdue Pharma"" fund rehabilitation centers, relapse prevention and holistic approaches; advertise the dangers of opioids; and re-educate doctors to stop overprescribing.",A photographer who kicked her OxyContin addiction fights on the front lines against the scourge that recalls H.I.V.

Dance,Paul Taylor Season's Premieres Lack the Luster of Its Revivals,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/arts/dance/paul-taylor-american-modern-dance-premieres.html,"What are we to make of the choreographer Paul Taylor and his annual three-week New York season? His dancers -- the company is based here -- are among the city's most accomplished, personable and sensuous; his repertory includes many of the world's most oddly imaginative masterpieces. In 2014 Mr. Taylor announced, and in 2015 began to realize, his plan to turn his company -- before that, almost invariably a vehicle for his own work -- into a repertory troupe that honored both previous and later generations of American modern dance. Nobody has ever been so well placed to advance such a project. It has often seemed that the mainstream of American modern dance tradition passes through Mr. Taylor. In the 1950s, he danced for the choreographers Merce Cunningham and Martha Graham. He began to choreograph in 1954, went independent with his own company in 1962, and for decades produced many classics. Pina Bausch and Twyla Tharp are just two of the choreographers who danced in his company early in their careers; Taylorisms are to be found in many of the best dances by the choreographer Mark Morris. A central problem, though, is that Mr. Taylor, 86, is a master choreographer -- singular in both compositional canniness and idiosyncratic imagination -- who, paradoxically, keeps forgetting the secrets of his mastery. Since 1986, there have been periods when his work has lacked any fertilizing inspiration; none of the dances he has made since 2010 have been important.

His company has opened its season with characteristic abundance: nine works, including three premieres, in the first three performances, with 13 other pieces to follow. The many revivals are where the season's heart beats most strongly. Wednesday brought the world premiere of his ""Ports of Call,"" a complete embarrassment; Thursday's gala featured the New York premiere of his ""The Open Door,"" half-baked at best. Both are comedies; in each case the comedy fails. Both show the bold peculiarity of conception that characterizes many of Mr. Taylor's finest works, but there's none of the Taylor dance poetry that might make them airborne. ""The Open Door"" is set to Elgar's ""Enigma Variations,"" but Elgar wrote 14 variations, and Taylor brings the curtain down after No. 10. There have been other Taylor creations in recent years that have seemed unfinished; this one, truncating a musical masterpiece, is the most obviously so. You can easily see the originality of Mr. Taylor's idea, which derives from Elgar's music (and maybe from Frederick Ashton's 1968 ballet for that). The Host (Michael Novak) invites a wonderfully motley gathering of eccentrics into his home, sets them performing and even quarreling, and then, when they are gone, starts to create dance poetry. Both with them and alone, Mr. Novak has rapturous gestures, as if building castles in the air, that begin to make magic; they lead nowhere. William Ivey Long's set and costumes, which place ""The Open Door"" in an early-20th-century country house with a lazy green landscape outside, have a lot more detail and fun than Mr. Taylor's dance. ""Ports of Call"" is set to two works by Jacques Ibert: ""Escales"" (which means ""Ports of Call"") and ""Divertissement""; the ports, according to the program, are in Africa, Hawaii, Alaska and the American Midwest. It's a piece of cartoon craziness whose fun goes nowhere. Again, the designer -- here, Mr. Taylor's long-term colleague Santo Loquasto -- has provided much more vitality than the choreography, as does Ibert's potently colorful music.

""The Open Door"" began Thursday's gala, whose centerpiece was the world premiere of Lila York's ""Continuum."" Ms. York, a Taylor dancer for 12 years, is a prolific choreographer. Her opening tableau in ""Continuum"" handsomely paid tribute to the way many of Mr. Taylor's pure-dance works start with an immobile nucleus that we know will soon burst forth into dance life like a seed head. All of ""Continuum"" showed Taylorian dance skill, energy, form, contrast. Dances for Laura Halzack, Sean Mahoney, Mr. Novak and Michael Trusnovec, among others, demonstrated Ms. York's appreciation of these artists' talent. Yet the score she chose, Max Richter's ""Recompose: The Four Seasons,"" feels to me entirely synthetic (Vivaldi meets minimalism), and so does this dance. It's a skillful Taylor pastiche, reminding us of the real Taylor experience without challenging it or making it fresh.

His company now has two personas. On tour outside New York, it remains the Paul Taylor Dance Company, performing an exclusively Taylor repertory; it arrived in New York fresh from a successful four-performance engagement in Sarasota, Fla. In this annual New York season (at the David H. Koch Theater since 2011), it's called Paul Taylor American Modern Dance. This New York experiment still feels different at every performance. Some works project fully into the depths and breadths of the Koch space, but not all. Mr. Trusnovec, the company's foremost dancer, now seems to lack the juice for the sensuously textured ""Brandenburgs."" But most of these dancers are in their prime; every part of their bodies seems to sing with rich, bright depth of tone.","Our chief dance critic on premieres at the Paul Taylor American Modern Dance season, including new works by Mr. Taylor, who is still prolific at 86.",ed07e16d-e7f1-537e-950a-61482ea30b2e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/11/arts/11PAULTAYLOR1/11PAULTAYLOR1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=19d86ce4e4f2e7d3395684fae988dcc38be74319b7c024409f4def091e105453&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Michael Apuzzo, left, and Francisco Graciano of Paul Taylor American Modern Dance in the world premiere of ""Ports of Call"" at the David H.

Sports,"Rafael Nadal, After a Late Night at the French Open, Will Face Diego Schwartzman in the Semifinals",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/sports/tennis/french-open-diego-schwartzman-dominic-thiem.html,"Rafael Nadal, After a Late Night at the French Open, Will Face Diego Schwartzman in the Semifinals

Diego Schwartzman had to play for more than five hours to defeat the third-seeded Dominic Thiem in five sets at Roland Garros, while Rafael Nadal required just three sets to beat Jannik Sinner, an unseeded 19-year-old Italian. But Nadal and Schwartzman, who will play in the semifinals on Friday, both had to overcome significant obstacles during the longest session of tennis ever at the French Open. It began on Tuesday morning and ended Wednesday at nearly 1:30 a.m. Paris time as Nadal finished off Sinner with a leaping overhead, 7-6 (4), 6-4, 6-1. By then, Schwartzman was back in the players' hotel near the Eiffel Tower, recovering from his grueling duel with Thiem.

For quite some time, Schwartzman kept cracking. With Thiem serving at 4-5 in the second set, Schwartzman had a straightforward forehand near the net that he would typically have smacked for a winner to take a 15-40 lead and give himself two set points. Instead, Schwartzman missed into the net and Thiem went on to hold and even the match at one set apiece. Schwartzman also served for the third set at 5-3, only to be broken at love, making four unforced errors. ""I was so nervous,"" Schwartzman said. ""I saw a chance today, and I didn't take it in the second and third sets."" It looked as though he might not be able to break the bad habit when he served for the fourth set at 5-4 and took a 40-love lead. Thiem saved all three set points, the last with a forehand winner on the run, and broke Schwartzman's serve. But Schwartzman, often frustrated with himself and his team after Tuesday's earlier disappointments, smiled through the pain this time. ""He played three unreal points, amazing points, because he's one of the best and he can do it,"" Schwartzman said of Thiem. ""At that time I was thinking, 'OK, come on, today is not going to happen.' I had a lot of opportunities, easy, tough ones, hard. Every single opportunity was different. I didn't take it."" That premonition proved false. Schwartzman recovered and fought back to win the fourth-set tiebreaker after Thiem was two points from winning the match with a 5-4 lead. He then broke Thiem's serve twice in the fifth set, and the friendly rivals were soon chatting and grinning at the net, their 5-hour-8-minute test complete.

""I just told him that he deserves it,"" Thiem said. So there will be no U.S. Open-French Open double champion in singles for this unique season. Thiem, a finalist at Roland Garros the last two years, tried to recover from his breakthrough victory in New York by taking two weeks off before the French Open, which was postponed from its usual dates in May and June because of the coronavirus pandemic. But Thiem was pushed to five sets in the fourth round by the French wild-card entry Hugo Gaston and was pushed even harder by Schwartzman in cool, heavy conditions that made clean winners a challenge. Thiem at times looked as weary as a man who had finished a marathon rather than one who was still in the middle of one. ""To be honest, I was over the limit today,"" Thiem said. ""Maybe I would have recovered. Even though I'm physically and mentally on the edge, you never know in a Slam, especially with Wednesday and Thursday off, two full days to recover. You never know what's happening. But at the end, I gave everything I had out there. It was an amazing match."" This year at Roland Garros, it will be up to Schwartzman, not Thiem, to face Nadal, whom Schwartzman defeated for the first time in the Italian Open last month. Nadal, the 12-time French Open champion, is a creature of ritual, but this year's autumnal edition of his signature tournament has pushed him far outside his comfort zone. With a roof on the main Philippe Chatrier Court, as well as floodlights, night matches are now possible. The conditions have blunted some of the pace of Nadal's whipping forehand and left it bouncing on average three and a half inches lower than in 2019, according to Tennis Channel. On Tuesday, that often put the ball right in the gifted Sinner's strike zone during the first two sets, and the teenager held his own for nearly two hours. He served for the first set and won a surprising share of the baseline duels with his clean, relatively flat hitting. His feathery footwork and ability to open up the court with power and sharp angles were all remarkable.

Collins, a fiery competitor and a two-time N.C.A.A. singles champion at the University of Virginia, was a surprise semifinalist at the 2019 Australian Open. Now she is a surprise quarterfinalist at another major, after falling back in the rankings in the past year.

Movies,'My Darling Vivian' Review: The Forgotten Wife of Johnny Cash,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/movies/my-darling-vivian-review.html,"In the mythologized version of the Johnny Cash story, his wife and collaborator, June Carter, is portrayed as the saintly woman who rescued the country singer from the dark side of fame. That story was immortalized in the 2005 film ""Walk the Line,"" for which Reese Witherspoon won the Oscar for best actress. Cash's first wife, Vivian Liberto (played in that film by Ginnifer Goodwin), on the other hand, was made to look like a petty shrew on the sidelines when really she was the inspiration for the song ""I Walk the Line.""

The documentary ""My Darling Vivian"" attempts to salvage the reputation of a woman believed to be misconstrued and shoved into obscurity. Directed by Matt Riddlehoover and produced by his husband, Dustin Tittle (a grandson of Cash and Liberto's), this may be the most comprehensive film portrait of Liberto yet, but the absence of her own voice is still achingly felt. (She died in 2005.)","The singer-songwriter's romance with June Carter is well-known, but this new documentary shines the spotlight on Cash's first wife, Vivian Liberto.",8fbf626b-acf2-5265-8b67-2df59a80490c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/18/arts/18mydarling/18mydarling-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=9aab43f2c35070002ae7b8d5af2347370d68997e636f6803027428b5157fd351&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Vivian Liberto and Johnny Cash in the documentary ""My Darling Vivian,"" directed by Matt Riddlehoover.",8fbf626b-acf2-5265-8b67-2df59a80490c,N24News/imgs/8fbf626b-acf2-5265-8b67-2df59a80490c.jpg,5
Your Money,"For Workers Without Retirement Savings, State-Run I.R.A.s Can Pay Off",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/your-money/state-retirement-accounts.html,"A new breed of state-based savings accounts can help workers prepare for retirement, in part by allowing them to push back the time when they file for Social Security payments, a new analysis suggests.

Half of all states have considered plans to offer automatic individual retirement accounts, and at least five (California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maryland and Oregon) have begun offering them or have taken steps toward doing so. The plans vary in their details but, in general, are for workers at private-sector employers that don't offer retirement plans. Those workers are automatically enrolled in the state I.R.A. program and have contributions withdrawn from their paychecks, although they can choose to opt out or change their contribution.

Many people think they must start receiving Social Security as soon as they retire, but the two steps don't have to be done simultaneously. People can start claiming their federal benefits at age 62, but waiting at least a year or two to collect means their monthly payments will be larger because of the way the federal program is structured.

Those enrolled in the new state-sponsored accounts could, instead, use that money to temporarily cover their expenses after they retire, allowing them to delay claiming their Social Security benefits for a year or more, the report from the Pew Charitable Trusts said.",A Pew study found that people could use the money in their state accounts to delay taking Social Security benefits. That would lead to higher federal payments.,4b0af568-d350-5e23-af73-b46d44dff495,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/21/business/21adviser/21adviser-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=05dc304cf3117b0e91ff62f5e15dd2064925d4b31721520f8ba56a9b88f3c824&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Retirees could use money from their state-sponsored accounts to cover a year or more of costs, delaying — and thereby increasing — monthly Social Security benefits.",4b0af568-d350-5e23-af73-b46d44dff495,N24News/imgs/4b0af568-d350-5e23-af73-b46d44dff495.jpg,21
Art & Design,'Desert X' Treats Arid Space as a Rich Canvas,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/arts/desert-x-turns-an-arid-space-into-a-canvas.html,"PALM SPRINGS, Calif. -- Roaming off-road through sandy, rock-studded terrain in view of mountain peaks and windmill farms, a six-wheeled rover about the size of a milk crate backed up and sped away from its creator. With infrared detectors to elude heat-producing objects and other sensors to identify solid forms, the bot is in effect programmed to avoid human interaction. She's known as a ""shy bot."" ""She doesn't have consciousness in the classical way, but she is sensitive,"" said the Italian artist behind the bot who, seeking to avoid celebrity himself, goes by the name Norma Jeane. ""She does not want to be bothered.""

The shy bot is one of 16 art projects spread across the Palm Springs, Calif., area from Desert Hot Springs to Coachella as part of the sprawling new exhibition ""Desert X,"" running Saturday through April 30. The bot is also one of several artworks in the show that play with fantasies of the desert as a great existential escape: a refuge for anyone (or anything) seeking to shed the straitjacket of civilization, to vanish from sight or just be left alone under the purportedly sheltering sky.

Other disappearing acts include a mirror-clad ranch house designed by Doug Aitken to reflect and dissolve into its surroundings, a nuclear bunker by Will Boone buried in the sand that holds a sculpture of John F. Kennedy inside and photo-billboards positioned by Jennifer Bolande along the road in such a way so they blend into the mountain landscape behind them around dusk. (All works are free to the public, but some have limited hours.) ""The mythology is the desert is a place to go to find yourself, but in order to do so you have to lose yourself,"" said Neville Wakefield, the New York curator who directed this inaugural show. ""It's about letting everything go in order to find something."" (He said the ""Desert X"" board, which includes local cultural leaders trying to boost the region's reputation as a visual art destination, has not committed to any schedule yet -- ""biennial, triennial or unpredictable."") The Marlboro Man of appropriation art, Richard Prince, found in the desert a bastion of lawlessness as wild as the internet he so often trolls for images. He has taken over an old home in Desert Hot Springs so derelict that it looks like it might have been a meth den in better days. He has not cleaned up the place so much as trashed it with his own art: printing on paper and vinyl sheets images of his Twitter posts about fictional lowlife relatives -- ""family tweets,"" he calls the series -- and plastering them throughout the property. Tweets are stapled to walls, pinned to the floor with rocks and tossed on the scrubby grounds outside, beside soda cups and dirty diapers. Those crumpled-up papers blowing across the front yard like tumbleweed? Yes, those are family tweets, too. One reads: ""I put an ad in a swingers magazine and my mother answered."" The photos printed beneath the tweets range from tacky to pornography. Mr. Wakefield sees it as ""a portrait of American family dysfunction"" but also a self-portrait of the artist. ""The house is the home is the head,"" he quipped.

Of the 16 artists in ""Desert X,"" there are only four women -- ""and too many machos,"" Norma Jeane offered when explaining the female gender he assigned to his bot. Asked about the imbalance, Mr. Wakefield said, ""I'm not a quota curator."" ""The balance was more even at the early stages of conversation, but this is somehow what came out of it,"" he said. ""I don't know if there's a gender affinity with the desert, but historically a lot of the mythologies of the desert -- starting with biblical examples of being cast into the wilderness -- are male."" As it turns out, the work made by women in Desert X proved less spectacle-driven and more contemplative. A sound installation by Lita Albuquerque (with performances not seen by this reporter) centers on a blue female sculpture with her ear to the ground.

The work of the Swiss artist Claudia Comte, a wall nearly 10 feet high and 100 feet long at the base of hiking trails in Palm Desert, might at a distance seem a critique of President Trump's plans for reinforcing the border. But up close, it's clear that the artwork is a painting as much as a wall, covered with repeating black S-patterns that gradually sharpen into zigzags as you walk along it. The wall appears to bulge in spots because of the curves, an optical effect that nods to Op Art painting as well as to heat haze, the shimmering visual distortion that can occur in the desert. At another trailhead further west, near the base of the Whitewater Preserve, the Los Angeles-based Sherin Guirguis has built a domed, earthen sculpture like the pigeon towers popular in Egypt, where she grew up. The towers are typically used to breed the birds for food or sport (and, more rarely, for espionage missions). Her sculpture has niches for birds, but she doesn't expect any to actually use it; she wants viewers to wonder about its significance.","This exhibition, featuring 16 art projects across the Palm Springs, Calif., area, plays off the desert as a great escape.",a070d9e1-a4c0-5400-91f0-c2c021e2216e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/24/arts/25DESERTART5/24DESERTART5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=7ea103fdc8fce340bf94acacc21b8f4640af6ac5994b2e0c1726783c321db779&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The artist Norma Jeane with a bot that will be part of the ""Desert X"" exhibition in California.",a070d9e1-a4c0-5400-91f0-c2c021e2216e,N24News/imgs/a070d9e1-a4c0-5400-91f0-c2c021e2216e.jpg,14
Dance,Twyla Tharp's Troupe Prepares for a Milestone Tour,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/06/arts/dance/twyla-tharps-troupe-prepares-for-a-milestone-tour.html,"Nothing Twyla Tharp does is casual, especially when it comes to the cultivation of a dancer. ""We have to establish our own identity together,"" she said in an interview, in advance of her 50th-anniversary tour. ""That takes time."" Throughout her career, Ms. Tharp has put in that time with dozens of dancers, many of whom -- like Savannah Lowery, a soloist with New York City Ballet -- have chosen to work with her during time off without a performance in sight. Along with the veterans Matthew Dibble, Rika Okamoto, John Selya and Ron Todorowski, Ms. Tharp has rounded out her new group with dancers from ""Come Fly Away"" (set to the songs of Frank Sinatra), like Ramona Kelley, as well as from those hailing from companies that have performed her ballets. Ms. Lowery -- taking a short leave from City Ballet -- has signed on, along with Kaitlyn Gilliland, whose career has grown exponentially since she left City Ballet. And finally, there is Reed Tankersley -- the baby of the group -- who just graduated from Juilliard. As Ms. Tharp prepares for her tour highlighting two new works, ""Preludes and Fugues"" (set to Bach) and ""Yowzie"" (to American jazz), she is aware of those who have graced her works. ""Obviously,"" she said, ""the dancers are at the heart of the whole matter."" But she also knows that they're only human -- and that 10 weeks on the road has its risks. ""Every single one of these people has taken a pledge on a stack of Bibles: I am not going down, I am not going down, I will not go down,"" Ms. Tharp said. (They'd better not: There is a sole understudy, Eric Otto.) That mantra must carry them to the final shows at the David H. Koch Theater in November. In the meantime, we put a selection of her crew under the spotlight.

At just five feet tall, Ramona Kelley may be tiny, but she moves big -- a lingering quality, perhaps, from her early years as a hip-hop dancer. At 13, she began studying ballet with Sally Streets -- for City Ballet fans, that's Kyra Nichols's mother -- to supplement her hip-hop dancing. ""I wanted to be in music videos,"" said the raven-haired dancer. ""It was hard to catch up with my peers in terms of ballet, but in hip-hop you have to pay attention to the little details. It's very similar to ballet."" Ms. Kelley came to Ms. Tharp's attention when she won the role of Betsy, the innocent girl who falls in love with a waiter, in the touring show of ""Come Fly Away."" This summer, she took over Ms. Tharp's part in ""The One Hundreds"" with all the clarity you could want. As Betsy, she moved fast; the new works, she said, are even faster. ""She gives it to you, and you think, How could I possibly do that many steps in that amount of time and get there?"" Ms. Kelley asked. ""It doesn't feel like it's ever going to happen. She knows it will.""

Reed Tankersley wasn't alive when Ms. Tharp's ""Baker's Dozen"" was unveiled at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1979. Nor was he around when she conceived much of its material: unused choreography from the film ""Hair."" Mr. Tankersley, a dancer with as much power as silkiness, performed ""Baker's Dozen"" as part of Juilliard Dances Repertory in 2014. Immediately he felt at home. ""I like movement that is technically driven, but not necessarily academic or pure technique,"" he said. ""That's not really my thing. She has so much style and groove to everything she does. But then you still hit a line."" Mr. Tankersley began dancing at 6; his training was a mix of concert dance and competitions. Ballet, at least its terminology, can be more of a head-scratcher for Mr. Tankersley, who performs a section of the humorous ""Yowzie"" with Ms. Gilliland and Ms. Lowery. ""There are things I've done my whole life, like sliding and floor work or just being barefoot -- those are so natural to me."" Then the ballet comes in. ""Twyla says a move like 'Tour de la ...' and I'm like, wait what? Savannah! What is that one?""

John Selya's first encounter with Twyla Tharp is still etched in his mind. It was 1989, and he was in a men's class at American Ballet Theater. After, she approached him with some pointers on his grand jete en croisee. He has since appeared in dozens of Ms. Tharp's works, from ballets to all of her Broadway shows. ""I'm a ballet dancer, but I try to camouflage that a lot of the time,"" he said. ""I love the underlying technique of ballet, but I hate the kind of constipation and preciousness of it.""

A fluid, athletic dancer with a steely core, Mr. Selya has a passion for surfing that gives him a profound center of gravity, allowing his limbs freedom to roam. Even so, becoming a Tharp dancer takes time, and for Mr. Selya, it occurred in 1994 when he was on tour with a group of dancers culled from several companies. ""She was so clear in her teaching and her choreography -- even though they were short works, they covered the spectrum: There was classical comedy, neoclassical, an African-influenced dance."" He learned that he could move in control of his rhythm while being irregular with it. ""Before then, I was like, I'm on the music -- isn't that good enough? And she's like, 'Get off the music and start doing your thing.' ""

""There's nothing magical about chemistry,"" Ms. Tharp said. ""I mean there is and there isn't. Sometimes you get lucky."" The statuesque pairing of Kaitlyn Gilliland and Savannah Lowery, who both trained at the School of American Ballet before joining City Ballet, is anything but. Ms. Gilliland was called to a Tharp audition, which she said that she ""bombed."" Several months later she attended a class, after which Ms. Tharp told her: ""You're very tall. All right. Do you want to work?"" Ms. Lowery, a powerful dancer reminiscent of the City Ballet soloist Gloria Govrin, was originally encouraged to dance with Ms. Tharp by Mr. Selya. ""I showed up at her apartment one afternoon,"" Ms. Lowery said, ""and I remember her opening the door and going, 'You're a big, tall girl.' I said, 'Yes I am.' "" For Ms. Tharp, it's a privilege to have them. ""They have a common technique -- ish,"" she said. ""They have an overlap of experience. They work together uncommonly well. They can do things, because they're so fast, that you wouldn't be able to do otherwise. If you had to drag it out of two dancers, everybody would be labored and exhausted, but because these guys get it, you can go boom, boom, boom."" Q. You're both tall in the tradition of the Tharp dancer Rose Marie Wright (Big Rose). Have you watched her dance on video? GILLILAND I've seen footage of Twyla and Rose doing ""The One Hundreds."" That's phenomenal! It almost looks like it's coming to them in the moment except that it can't possibly be because they're dancing completely in unison.","As Ms. Tharp works on the tour, which highlights two new works, she is aware that ""the dancers are at the heart of the whole matter.""",25aa3ae9-135f-561f-aa3c-a10cd4269e8c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/06/arts/06THARP-DANCERSWEB/06THARP-DANCERSWEB-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=d1d3868ba3512d5a7f2bc30e697a017cb9b5247b4087367c94f2b516a4bac2d9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Twyla Tharp, center, with dancers in rehearsal at the Baryshnikov Arts Center.",25aa3ae9-135f-561f-aa3c-a10cd4269e8c,N24News/imgs/25aa3ae9-135f-561f-aa3c-a10cd4269e8c.jpg,6
Dance,Simplicity in the Midst of Complexity,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/03/arts/dance/new-york-city-ballet-features-festival-of-choreographers.html,"Let's take a moment to consider the 10 artists in New York City Ballet's exciting Festival of 21st-Century Choreographers at the David H. Koch Theater: Mauro Bigonzetti, William Forsythe, Benjamin Millepied, Justin Peck, Angelin Preljocaj, Alexei Ratmansky, Liam Scarlett, Richard Tanner, Christopher Wheeldon and the company's ballet master in chief, Peter Martins. (Does the French street artist J R, the mind behind the flashy new ""Les Bosquets,"" make 11?)

If you've been following the development of ballet in the 21st century, it is unfortunately no surprise that the lineup includes no women. Here we are in 2014, still having to ask one of ballet's biggest and, in many ways, most forward-thinking institutions, Where are the female choreographers? Imagine if, instead of (or in addition to) luring J R's Instagram followers to the theater, Mr. Martins had commissioned a female artist, an overdue step toward closing this archaic and widely discussed gap. Crystal Pite? Pam Tanowitz? It's not as if they weren't out there (though there could certainly be more), making work as good as, if not better than, some of the choreographers on that list.

Yet even while bemoaning this perennial imbalance, it was hard to remain too frustrated on Wednesday, when the company radiated its customary excellence in works by Mr. Peck, Mr. Preljocaj and Mr. Wheeldon.

The program also included an elucidating ""See the Music"" demonstration. The interim music director, Andrews Sill, guided us through Sufjan Stevens's score for Mr. Peck's ""Year of the Rabbit,"" as arranged for strings by Michael P. Atkinson.

Fashion & Style,Ava Nirui Gives Bootleg a Fashion Twist,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/fashion/ava-nirui-designer-knockoffs.html,"Now Lives: In a modern three-bedroom apartment in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn that she shares with two friends. Claim to Fame: Ms. Nirui is a self-described ""luxury remixer"" known for putting a D.I.Y. spin on designer labels, like a tank top made from Gucci garment bags and an asthma inhaler bedazzled with the Dior logo. Her high-low creations have won her fashion fans, including Marc Jacobs, who hired her to create a bootleg hoodie that purposely misspelled his name as ""Mark Jacobes."" The $125 hoodies sold out in a single day last December. Ms. Nirui is also a writer, photographer and the digital editor at Helmut Lang. ""I've kind of become obsessed with customizing things and the fact that I can pay $5 for a Chinatown hoodie and change the context so it has the same value as a $900 sweatshirt,"" she said.

Big Break: In 2015, the designer Demna Gvasalia was making waves with his Vetements x Champion capsule collection. Not wanting to spend $1,100 on a sweatshirt, Ms. Nirui dreamed up her own version: a black Champion hoodie with the Comme des Garcons logo embroidered using the hoodie's iconic C. ""I remember thinking it was so absurd that it was so expensive,"" Ms. Nirui said. ""So I decided, 'No way. I'm just going to do my own.'"" She posted her creation to Instagram and was flooded with messages from people wanting to buy it, including Chance the Rapper. She declined to sell it, which only stoked demand further. ""It wasn't about making money,"" she said. ""It was about taking a piece of history and reworking it into something nobody else could have.""

Latest Project: In January, the Museum of Modern Art enlisted Ms. Nirui to make a limited-edition hoodie for the closing of its exhibit ""Items: Is Fashion Modern?"" The hoodies were based on Maison Margiela's numerical logo, and were given out to museumgoers for free. Next Thing: While Ms. Nirui is planning more hoodies (she declined to name the designers she is collaborating with), she is branching into zines and other creative forms. Most recently, she created a line of Barbie doll outfits for the Miami street wear brand Stray Rats. Bootleg for the Masses: Ms. Nirui doesn't consider her work as ""ripping off other designers,"" but as homage. ""Brands like Louis Vuitton and Chanel, they're the pinnacle of luxury, and things like that should be available to everyone,"" she said. ""If you can't afford it, make it. If that's what you want to wear, do it yourself.""",The 26-year-old artist puts a D.I.Y. spin on designer knockoffs.,24b4ac24-17a3-5d38-8c66-5e2d7bbd7aa9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/25/fashion/25UPNEXT1/25UPNEXT1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=77927271d1d3527f82dd098cde740b10c9a59be69255a7b035f6294de8f08f44&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ava Nirui, a D.I.Y. fashion bootlegger, in the meatpacking district in Manhattan.",24b4ac24-17a3-5d38-8c66-5e2d7bbd7aa9,N24News/imgs/24b4ac24-17a3-5d38-8c66-5e2d7bbd7aa9.jpg,19
Real Estate,"A Place in Brooklyn, the 'Hot Borough'",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/01/realestate/a-place-in-brooklyn-the-hot-borough.html,"Suzanne Cooke bought a large and sunny one-bedroom in the Clinton Hill Co-ops in Brooklyn in 2000. She lived there happily while working in the television field. In 2007, when she took a job in Chicago producing promos for ""The Oprah Winfrey Show,"" she sublet the apartment. A few years later, because of the co-op's sublet policy, she was forced to sell it, ""which sometimes I regret,"" she said. She hadn't thought she would be returning to New York. After the Oprah show ended, however, she changed her mind.

She hoped to find a two- or three-family brownstone, where she would live in the owner's unit and rent out the rest. She assumed that a price in the $600,000s would land a place near the A train in or near Bedford-Stuyvesant. ""You can get anywhere in no time flat on the A train,"" she said. Still, knowing a brownstone might not be feasible, she kept an eye out for two-bedrooms, at a top price of $440,000. She wanted a second bathroom, a doorman, a washer-dryer and a dishwasher. A view wasn't important. ""I knew I would never get a view that would compete with the view in Clinton Hill,"" she said. She didn't much like new construction, although the duplexes in a new condominium building on Gates Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant were an exception. ""I felt like it was my time to have stairs,"" she said. At that point, a two-bedroom there was around $450,000 with monthly charges in the mid-$500s. Ultimately, though, Ms. Cooke decided she preferred a prewar building.

As for the brownstones she saw, many were in grave disrepair, and some were snapped up by investors before she could consider them. One of the few that seemed suitable was a two-family on Hawthorne Street in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens, with a big skylight that ""lit up the entire house,"" Ms. Cooke said. The house needed ""a lot of work and a lot of love.""

It had two parking spots in front. Ms. Cooke doesn't drive, but she knew she could rent out the spots. She offered the asking price, $640,000. But another party offered cash. That happened a few times. And, though Ms. Cooke's experience subletting her Clinton Hill co-op had been good, ""I thought the brownstone maybe wasn't the best option,"" Ms. Ebanks said. ""What if the boiler isn't working and at the same time there is breaking news?"" So Ms. Cooke relinquished the brownstone idea. She liked a spacious and high-ceilinged two-bedroom co-op on Ocean Avenue in Prospect Park South. It, too, was in need of work. The price was $395,000, monthly maintenance in the high-$500s. ""You couldn't tell which bedroom was the master"" because both were equally big, Ms. Ebanks said. But the owner decided not to sell and took the apartment off the market. Ms. Cooke was in no rush, but prices were rising and her frustration was growing. At a beautifully restored Crown Heights two-bedroom, a fourth-floor walk-up, ""there was a line down the stairs waiting,"" she said. ""I knew I didn't stand a chance.""

She often ran into ""the same people I was competing with,"" she said. She was once stuck in an elevator with other apartment-hunters. ""We were talking about how infuriating it was, buying an apartment in Brooklyn, the new Brooklyn, the new hot borough,"" she said. The apartment was small -- and the group collectively decided that ""the price was outrageous."" Because a friend in a six-story 1940 building on Hawthorne Street kept singing its praises, she found herself back in that area, taking a look. The friend had also mentioned an appealing fact: ""She would talk about how many retired West Indian nurses were in her neighborhood,"" Ms. Cooke said, ""and my mom happens to be a retired West Indian nurse.""

Fashion & Style,The Men's Shows Roll Into Paris. Ho-hum or Quite Good?,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/fashion/mens-style/men-fashion-spring-2017-paris.html,"PARIS -- It is a telling detail that at fashion shows, critics and retailers tend to sit on opposite sides of the runway. Agreement on the merits or failings of any individual collection, or the fashion season as a whole, is as hard to come by in this world as accord across the aisle is in politics. A few collections manage the feat of pleasing everyone, but many others are critically beloved while impossibly unsalable, or till-ringingly commercial but poorly or begrudgingly reviewed.

With the men's fashion season now past the halfway point, it is a fine time to take the temperature of the season. The international scrum of editors, journalists and retailers (and the usual few drop-in celebrities) have come and gone to London, Florence (for the Pitti Uomo fair) and Milan and have arrived in Paris for the final leg of the twice-yearly tour, packing and repacking their oversized and often overweight luggage four times.

It is a transitional moment. Brands are grappling with whether to adopt a see-now, buy-now schedule of showing just before product arrives in stores. Several are between named designers (Calvin Klein Collection, Salvatore Ferragamo, Berluti) and others are not on the schedule, having combined their men's shows with their women's or elected to take a season off to give their new designers time to prepare (Burberry, Ermenegildo Zegna, Bottega Veneta, Saint Laurent).","Some critics have been grumbling but retailers, focusing on standouts like Gucci, look at the sunny side of sales.",02bc66d9-1539-52b8-8a96-535b11a98b58,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/22/fashion/23paris/23paris-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=5e4a5838378581cd2efb4c153242edba89b2950c40708edf591f087ed0cd0ad4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Starting off the Paris men's shows: the Balenciaga collection for spring 2017.,02bc66d9-1539-52b8-8a96-535b11a98b58,N24News/imgs/02bc66d9-1539-52b8-8a96-535b11a98b58.jpg,19
Health,Dementia on the Retreat in the U.S. and Europe,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/health/alzheimers-dementia-rates.html,"Dementia on the Retreat in the U.S. and Europe 
* None  

Despite the lack of effective treatments or preventive strategies, the dementia epidemic is on the wane in the United States and Europe, scientists reported on Monday. The risk for a person to develop dementia over a lifetime is now 13 percent lower than it was in 2010. Incidence rates at every age have steadily declined over the past quarter-century. If the trend continues, the paper's authors note, there will be 15 million fewer people in Europe and the United States with dementia than there are now. The study is the most definitive yet to document a decline in dementia rates. Its findings counter warnings from advocacy groups of a coming tsunami of Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, said Dr. John Morris, director of the Center for Aging at Washington University in St. Louis. It is correct that there are now more people than ever with dementia, but that is because there are more and more older people in the population. The new incidence data are ""hopeful,"" Dr. Morris said. ""It is such a strong study and such a powerful message. It suggests that the risk is modifiable."" Researchers at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass., reviewed data from seven large studies with a total of 49,202 individuals. The studies followed men and women aged 65 and older for at least 15 years, and included in-person exams and, in many cases, genetic data, brain scans and information on participants' risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The data also include a separate assessment of Alzheimer's disease. Its incidence, too, has steadily fallen, at a rate of 16 percent per decade, the researchers found. Their study was published in the journal Neurology. In 1995, a 75-year-old man had about a 25 percent chance of developing dementia in his remaining lifetime. Now that man's chance declined to 18 percent, said Dr. Albert Hofman, chairman of the department of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health and the lead author of the new paper. Although it is often said that women are more likely to get dementia than men, Dr. Hofman and his colleagues found that men and women have equal dementia rates. The reason for the confusion appears to be that there are more older women than older men in the population. At any age when dementia is likely, there will be more women with dementia in the population than men. One puzzling aspect of the decline is that it seems to be confined to Europe and the United States -- it was not seen in Asia, South America or, from limited data, in Africa. There have been reports of increasing dementia rates in Japan, China and Nigeria, the paper's authors note. Those increases are puzzling, Dr. Hofman said. The trend may be related to higher rates of smoking, which makes dementia more likely, in those countries. One leading hypothesis for the decline in the United States and Europe is improved control of cardiovascular risk factors, especially blood pressure and cholesterol. Nearly all dementia patients have other brain abnormalities, including blood vessel damage likely to be the result of high blood pressure. High blood pressure seems to be most damaging in middle age, Dr. Hofman said. Those with lower blood pressure earlier in life but higher blood pressure later tend to have reduced chances of dementia. Large swings in blood pressure are a risk at any age, he added. Another possible reason for declining dementia rates might be better education, which is thought to have a protective effect by giving the brain more capacity -- for example, a memory cache of more synonyms for words that were forgotten. Like control of blood pressure and cholesterol, education levels have gradually improved over the past few decades. ""There is a theory, but still not much evidence, that education shifts dementia to a later age,"" Dr. Hofman said. The genetic risk factors for dementia cannot have changed, said Dr. Richard Hodes, director of the National Institute on Aging. ""That means something in the environment has occurred,"" he added, which ""has to encourage us."" But if improved education is the answer, the decline in dementia rates may be nearing its end, Dr. Hodes noted. He also cautioned against assuming that factors like blood pressure or education, linked in observational studies to dementia, might signal cause and effect. Neither can scientists yet assume that various lifestyle factors linked to a lower risk of dementia mean they are protective. ""Many are using these reports to recommend better diets and more exercise,"" Dr. Hodes said. ""I couldn't possibly be opposed to more social interactions, more activity, better diets, better control of blood pressure."" ""But we need more research for a greater degree of certainty.""","Rates of dementia have steadily fallen over the past 25 years, a new study finds.

Books,A Fresh Look at How Poets Evolve Over the Course of a Career,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/books/review/craig-morgan-teicher-we-begin-in-gladness.html,"The title of Craig Morgan Teicher's new book, ""We Begin in Gladness,"" comes from a poem by William Wordsworth: ""We Poets in our youth begin in gladness; / But thereof come in the end despondency and madness."" These lines have come to embody a cliche about poets' downward emotional trajectories over the course of their careers, as if, writes Teicher, himself an accomplished poet, ""writing poems and looking too long at the trials of the human mind and heart in a troubled world beckon poets to their undoing."" He acknowledges the great poets of the last century who ""met terrible ends"" at the mercy of deteriorating mental health (among them Sylvia Plath, Randall Jarrell and John Berryman), but insists, quoting the critic Joan Acocella, that ""it is a species of sentimentality to think that the end of something tells the truth about it."" Teicher proposes a well-reasoned alternative: to read poets not so much by their experiences but by the evolution of their words -- ""by their journeys, by how their art grew and changed over the course of their writing lives.""

In this thoughtful book, he does just that, contemplating a range of poets, from Plath (whose work he wants to rescue from the retrospective weight of her suicide) to francine j. harris (whose experimental verse, often about racism and her life in Detroit, frequently avoids conventions of grammar and punctuation and can have an improvised feel). Early on, Teicher declares that to truly understand poets' work, we need to ""become them, or, more impossibly, to have been them."" He has to settle for less intimate modes of comprehension, including, for instance, the concept of ""apprenticeship,"" which provides a useful lens for considering questions of influence and transformation. Teicher frames the experimental poet Brenda Hillman's forays into Gnostic philosophy -- an ancient mystical tradition within Christianity -- as the impetus for a poetic breakthrough that allowed her to become ""the metaphysical poet she was striving to be, and also to think deeply about the relationship between the realms of imagination and of experience."" And he excavates the collision of influences in W. S. Merwin's work, which range from ancient Chinese poetry to Pre-Raphaelite painting and culminate in the masterly late poems of ""The Shadow of Sirius,"" a meditation on the nature of time. ""Merwin locates himself in an ongoing stream of losses,"" Teicher observes, taking ""a wide view of time, the kind of wide view one would need a lifetime to take.""

Teicher perceptively identifies the philosophical undercurrents in much of 20th- and 21st-century poetry and highlights important patterns of poetic influence. Yet he tends to neglect another key part of any poet's development: the awakening of his or her political sensibility. He overlooks, for example, the fact that for poets like Plath and Louise Gluck and Susan Wheeler, inhabiting -- and substantively revising -- a predominantly masculine creative tradition was itself a political act. For francine j. harris, politics are inextricable from her work's philosophical concerns. Since the publication of her first book, ""allegiance,"" harris has been praised for her attention to (and criticism of) the aesthetics of violation. In her poem ""katherine with the lazy eye. short. and not a good poet,"" she writes in the voice of a young woman addressing an acquaintance -- a fellow poet -- who has been found dead: ""i didn't like you. this is the first i remembered your name.""","In ""We Begin in Gladness,"" the poet and critic Craig Morgan Teicher considers poets from W.S. Merwin to francine j. harris, in light of changes in their language and their influence on one another.",16eee4c3-7d86-5705-97db-49decc2b4938,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/09/books/review/09Darling/09Darling-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=371&w=708&s=2d942303c7820ef6857391588da09fb2b9625604fd0a99dba37d8f39454a44e2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The poet Brenda Hillman.,16eee4c3-7d86-5705-97db-49decc2b4938,N24News/imgs/16eee4c3-7d86-5705-97db-49decc2b4938.jpg,13
Sports,"Astros Fire Two, but That Won't Clean Out Baseball's Den of Thieves",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/14/sports/baseball/astros-cheating-scandal.html,"The Houston Astros have offered us all a lesson this week in legal and illegal baseball, and the oh-so-thin membrane between the two. An Astros hitter can line a hit and motor into second base. From that perch he can stare at the opposing catcher and set to stealing pitching signs. Then he can break dance or do jumping jacks or anything else he can contrive to let the batter know the identity of the next pitch. That is baseball legal, and worth a giggle. By contrast, a team apparatchik can sit in an airless office and stare at the television screen and decipher those same pitching signs. He can relay his findings to the bench, where players proceed with yips and howls and thumping of garbage cans to communicate to their batter that a fastball is a-coming.

On Monday, we learned the Astros committed many high crimes during the 2017 and 2018 seasons. Infamy was instantaneous. Major League Baseball released a blistering report, and the Astros owner Jim Crane fired his general manager, Jeff Luhnow, and his field manager, A.J. Hinch, less than an hour after baseball's commissioner had suspended them for a year. The team was stripped of top draft picks and will pay a large fine. In one afternoon, the Astros went from colorfully outfitted darlings who played in the World Series last autumn to cheats living in shadowed ignominy. I balk at playing defense lawyer, as my clients are not invariably appetizing. Luhnow, in particular, tended to groove on arrogance; he was the sort of cat who could tip his old employer, McKinsey & Company, to just how difficult it was for a clever fellow like him in this primitive industry. ""You've got 150 people working in baseball operations, 200 players in a system, some of them have no high school education, some don't speak English,"" he explained to McKinsey in an interview in 2018. ""You're dealing with a very difficult population to implement new things that are not normal to them."" Luhnow offered this lament even as the Astros were filching pitching signs like itchy-fingered bank robbers.

* Phillie Phavorite: Bryce Harper truly committed to Philadelphia and now he's back on top of baseball, winning the N.L. M.V.P.

* Baseball Is Stuck in Neutral: The potential of a lockout has a star-studded group of free agents waiting for the dust to settle.
* Free-Agency Tracker: Get the latest updates on signings, contract extensions and trades. Hinch seemed a better-balanced man, but he can lay no claim to plausible surprise. Late in the 2017 season, Robert Manfred, the league commissioner, caught the Red Sox and the Yankees stealing signals, and he levied fines and made it clear he had grown weary of high-tech thievery. The Astros paid no heed, and so we now devote ourselves to damn, denounce and deprecate.

First, though, let's note countervailing facts. Stealing signs is an ancient art. A New York Giant named Bobby Thomson hit a famous home run to give the Giants a win over the Brooklyn Dodgers in the third game of a three-game playoff in 1951, a shot that broke hearts and lifted spirits and that lives on in music and literature. As The Wall Street Journal reported five decades later, it turned out that Giants Manager Leo Durocher, who is known for the famous sports quotation ""Nice guys finish last,"" had installed a coach far in the manager's office in center field and handed him binoculars. When he had decoded the pitching signs, he put his thumb on a buzzer that sounded in the Giants' bullpen, and players there signaled the hitter. Perhaps Thomson's homer was a pickpocket's reward. Just last summer, the Mets' manager, Mickey Callaway, and his bench coach, Jim Riggleman, leveled an accusation at the Los Angeles Dodgers, who lost the 2017 World Series to the Astros. ""I think they have a system that helps them get signals and stuff,"" Riggleman told reporters in May. There was no proof, but then again there rarely is. Let's move beyond mere pilferage. Tony La Russa presided as manager over the birth of the sluggo steroids era in Oakland and then served as manager at its apogee in St. Louis, when Mark McGwire made like Popeye and swatted home runs toward the Mississippi. Through it all, La Russa waved off any suggestion that his sluggers were doping, and he was later admitted to the Baseball Hall of Fame. A scandal that leads players to inject illegal steroids to compete with absurdly muscled competitors is worse than banging like a banshee on a garbage can in hopes you can communicate to a hitter that a 93 miles-per-hour slider will arrive in the next 1.1 seconds. Professional athletes are stunning creatures, though, and so I would not rule out that such information might confer an edge. In 2017, the Astros hit .279 at home with 115 home runs and a .472 slugging average. On the road, where a pitch-stealing scam was more difficult to pull off, the Astros hit .284 with 123 home runs and a .483 slugging average. That was not a one-off. In 2018, the Astros hit .248 at home with 92 home runs; on the road, the Astros hit .262 with 113 home runs.

I was more intrigued on Monday by Manfred's logic in meting out punishment. He found that Hinch knew cheating was afoot and that although Hinch disliked it, he did not stamp it out. Hinch was the dugout boss, Manfred reasoned, and so he deserved a yearlong suspension. Crane, the Astros owner, fired him instead. As for Luhnow, Manfred noted the great innovator ""adamantly"" denied knowing anything about the sophisticated theft operation. But ""documentary"" evidence, Manfred said, gave lie to his protestations. He, too, was suspended for a year by M.L.B. -- and then fired by the Astros. That brings us to Crane, who has had his own troubles. In 2000, long before he purchased the Astros, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission found that his company tried to avoid hiring and promoting black and Latino employees. ""Once you hire blacks,"" Crane was accused of saying, ""you can never fire them."" Crane is the Astros' boss of bosses. He was presumably aware of the loud rumors that his team had made a science of plundering pitching signals. Manfred, however, showed solicitude for a man who, by the by, was one of his bosses. Crane, Manfred said, was ""extraordinarily troubled and upset by the conduct of members of his organization."" He was aware of nothing. Manfred's care in establishing Crane's ignorance was touching. I was more struck by something else Luhnow told McKinsey in that 2018 interview. ""As our people see that the decisions that the organization did make was actually better than the decision they would've made had they been in charge,"" he boasted, ""that's when you start to build up confidence."" It's a fair guess organizational confidence is at a low just about now.",One takeaway from the Astros' sign-stealing scandal is the cheating is ignored until the moment it isn't.,23c155ee-7bf1-5639-ab84-87c0ff8e2c6f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/14/sports/14powell/14powell-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=2b5639b3a426204541518a2ab55a0f8c03cf326e61f737f7149ec666654ebdea&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Astros Manager A.J.

Art & Design,"It Didn't Hit $1 Billion, but Rockefeller Sale Still Set High",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/11/arts/design/it-didnt-hit-1-billion-but-rockefeller-sale-still-set-a-record.html,"""The Collection of Peggy and David Rockefeller"" included many furnishings from the couple's homes in town and country.

No, the Rockefeller trove didn't bring $1 billion this week, despite industry speculation that it might reach that historic high. The total fell considerably shy at nearly $833 million. But the treasures of David and Peggy Rockefeller still set a high for the most valuable private collection sold at auction, surpassing the $443 million total (revised in 2013) for the Yves Saint Laurent collection in 2009. And the vigorous buying this week for everything from a Monet to a money clip nevertheless surprised many art experts. Collectors and dealers generally agreed that the provenance of the prominent couple, together with Christie's savvy marketing campaign (""Live Like a Rockefeller""), amounted to a magical alchemy of sorts that resulted in strong sales across the board.

""Whether you've been in the market forever or you're coming into the market today, you really do have to honor the history here,"" said the art adviser Sandy Heller. ""It's like things coming out of Buckingham Palace -- this is what they were for this country and culture.""

And for some, there was the additional satisfaction of knowing that the proceeds would go to various charities, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Maine Coast Heritage Trust. Art market veterans were particularly struck by the strength of bidding for Impressionist lots like Monet's ""Nympheas en Fleur"" (""Water Lilies in Bloom""), given the current cultural focus on contemporary art (and the consensus that the work was not one of the artist's best water lilies pieces). Nevertheless, the painting prompted frenzied activity in the room and on the phones, ultimately selling for $85 million with fees, a considerable jump from its $50 million estimate. The winning bid was placed on the phone by Xin Li Cohen, the deputy chairman of Christie's Asia. ""I was very reassured by it,"" said Melanie Clore, a veteran Sotheby's specialist who recently became an art adviser. ""The traditional Impressionist pictures made good prices. It confirmed there is still a market for those paintings.""

There was the usual post-sale speculation about who bought what, with Christie's reporting that a sprinkling of buyers were institutions. Because Gary Tinterow, director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, was the successful bidder on Georges Seurat's ""La Rade de Grandcamp (Le Port de Grandcamp),"" which sold for $34 million, many assumed he had bought it for his own museum. Mr. Tinterow, in a telephone interview, said he had bought it for a Houston collector. The Rockefellers' place settings and collectibles also brought huge prices, including the 14-karat-gold money clip -- depicting Rockefeller Center -- which sold for a whopping $75,000 with fees (against an estimate of about $1,200). ""I am surprised at how much more the decorative arts are making than estimate,"" Marc Porter, the chairman of Christie's Americas, said. ""I expected some Rockefeller premium, but not the multiples of five and 10."" The ""Rockefeller Money Clip,"" an openwork gold plaque depicting Rockefeller Center, originally belonged to Laurance Rockefeller and brought $75,000 at auction. Mr. Porter said the $1 billion figure was promoted by the press and not Christie's. ""I never thought it could make a billion dollars,"" he said. Speaking of Tuesday night's $646 million auction of 19th and 20th century art, he said, ""You would have to have added another $200 million to that evening sale, which was beyond anyone's expectation."" Still, had bidding taken off for the highest-priced lot of the week, ""Fillette a la Corbeille Fleurie"" (Young Girl With Basket of Flowers), Christie's might have come close. Instead, the painting sold on one bid to its guarantor for $115 million, with fees. But Mr. Porter said the work was always a gamble, given that it depicts a naked teenage girl and is not easily recognizable as a Picasso.

""It's a tough picture,"" Mr. Porter said. ""It's tough in subject matter and it's tough in that it's not graphically readable."" The lot was purchased by the Nahmad family, according to two sources close to the sale -- one a former auction executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect business relationships. Helly Nahmad, a dealer, would not confirm this, saying only that ""it's a great painting."" He added, ""It's being loaned to the Musee d'Orsay."" Needless to say, the Rockefeller family, which had been guaranteed $650 million by Christie's, was pleased with the results, with members of the family attending the live auctions and hosting a toast for Christie's after Wednesday evening's ""Art of the Americas"" sale. Diego Rivera's ""The Rivals"" -- depicting a traditional Oaxacan festival -- brought nearly $10 million, an auction high for the artist, that night. Abby Aldrich Rockefeller commissioned it in 1931. ""There is some sentimentality about seeing a collection that was so tightly together and in four different houses split apart,"" David Rockefeller Jr. said in a telephone interview. ""It's a great mixture of anticipation of exhilaration and some sadness."" Asked if there was a particular artwork for sale Tuesday that conjured his father, Mr. Rockefeller said it was Matisse's ""Odalisque Couchee aux Magnolias,"" painted in Nice in 1923 and set against a richly decorated background.",The art and decorative objects of one of the dynasties of American royalty did not disappoint at Christie's.,5420af0c-bbe2-53aa-a162-b86a60d8f207,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/12/arts/12auction1/12auction1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=ebf7a56d33bf60223996c1204eb2ef8c7095fffdf9acff404c4e7b9fa7dd47dc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,&ldquo;The Collection of Peggy and David Rockefeller&rdquo; included many furnishings from the couple&rsquo;s homes in town and country.,5420af0c-bbe2-53aa-a162-b86a60d8f207,N24News/imgs/5420af0c-bbe2-53aa-a162-b86a60d8f207.jpg,14

Sports,"A Week Later, a Blown Call Is Still Topic A",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/sports/nickell-robey-coleman-los-angeles-rams-super-bowl.html,"ATLANTA -- At N.F.L. media nights, the biggest stars speak at podiums, and this year was no different. When the Los Angeles Rams took the floor, quarterback Jared Goff, running back Todd Gurley II and Coach Sean McVay drew big crowds.

But cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman drew equally large crowds. A week ago, Robey-Coleman was just a former undrafted free agent finishing his sixth season. Now, he needed media minders to keep reporters from digging too deeply into a play that may have altered the Super Bowl.

Media,"In Beating Disney for Sky, Comcast Remains in the Game",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/23/business/media/comcast-disney-sky.html,"Comcast and the Walt Disney Company have long been rivals. But Brian L. Roberts, who runs Comcast, has recently become the Magic Kingdom's nemesis in chief. He waged an unrelenting fight for 21st Century Fox over the summer, forcing Disney to pay about $18 billion more than it had planned in order to secure Rupert Murdoch's entertainment empire. Then, on Saturday, Comcast emerged as the decisive victor in a battle with Disney for control of the British pay-television company Sky. In a deal valued at $39 billion, Comcast bid PS17.28 per Sky share, while Fox -- bidding on behalf of its soon-to-be owner, Disney -- bid PS15.67 a share. For Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, the loss of Sky and its vast European customer base to Mr. Roberts has to sting. It was perhaps the first time during his ultrasuccessful 13-year tenure that Mr. Iger was denied such a prize, one he called ""a crown jewel"" when first pursuing it. But the realities of the entertainment business make the outcome more complicated. ""I am happy that Disney didn't get it,"" Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, said in an email. ""Comcast paid a very expensive price for this, and I think it's hard to justify.""

Comcast's offer for the majority stake in Sky puts that total value of the company at $48 billion including assumed debt, or 15 times expected 2018 earnings. Disney will own 39 percent of Sky through its 21st Century Fox acquisition. Mr. Iger can hold on to those shares or sell them to Comcast. Disney's stake in Sky would be valued at about $15 billion in such a deal, money that could be used to pay down debt associated with the Fox purchase. Mr. Iger could also refuse to sell, which would put more pressure on Mr. Roberts because there will be a smaller pool of Sky investors from which to cobble together a majority stake. Sky shareholders must agree to sell their stock to Comcast in the weeks ahead. Comcast needs more than 50 percent of shares to complete its offer. Hulu could emerge as another chess piece. Disney is poised to own about 60 percent of that service after it closes the deal for 21st Century Fox, but Comcast would remain a minority shareholder with 30 percent. Hulu, which has over 20 million subscribers, is a pillar in Mr. Iger's new strategy to sell Disney's shows and films directly to consumers.

Comcast, however, is keen on keeping its Hulu investment and would be willing to continue selling streaming rights for its NBC series to the service, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions. That stance could change, they acknowledged. Analysts have bandied about the possibility that Disney could sell its 39 percent stake in Sky if Comcast were willing to sell its 30 percent ownership of Hulu. British takeover laws, however, would forbid such a tit-for-tat maneuver. A Hulu transaction would have to be a parallel deal and not contingent on the Sky stake. In the battle with Mr. Roberts, Mr. Iger won the big prize: 21st Century Fox. That's a purchase that, in addition to Hulu and the Sky stake, includes assets like a leading TV studio with more than 30 series in production, the ""X-Men"" and ""Avatar"" franchises and overseas TV providers like Star of India. Absorbing those businesses -- a huge task given disparate corporate cultures -- will allow Disney to become one of the few traditional media companies with enough scale and intellectual property to compete against Netflix and tech giants like Apple and Amazon, both of which are moving aggressively in Hollywood.

In fighting to the end for Sky, Disney forced Comcast to pay 27 percent more than it initially offered, essentially returning the favor for driving up the 21st Century Fox price. Comcast expects cost savings of about $600 million after folding Sky into its business.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Mr. Iger can still use his world-class collection of content rights -- Marvel superheroes, the Disney Princesses, ""Star Wars,"" Pixar's beloved characters -- to roll out Disney's planned streaming service (known in industry parlance as an ""over the top"" business) in Europe. ""They can use their rights to go over the top in the long run in Europe,"" Mr. Nathanson said. In Sky, Comcast gets one of Europe's largest media companies, with nearly 23 million customers across five countries, including Britain, Germany and Italy. For British viewers used to living in a media universe long dominated by the Murdoch family, the potential Comcast takeover signals a notable shift in ownership.

Indeed, the most stinging loss may belong to the Murdoch family, which has been fighting for control of Sky for the better part of a decade. Mr. Murdoch, 87, co-founded the satellite TV company in 1989 to compete with the British Broadcasting Corporation. Sky, which has 31,000 employees and generated about $17 billion in revenue last year, ranks as one of the most popular TV brands in Europe. It creates its own original shows, runs an influential news channel and has exclusive partnerships in Europe with HBO, Showtime and Warner Bros. After losing out to Disney in the battle for 21st Century Fox, getting Sky became an imperative for Comcast. It was, by some measures, the only way for the Philadelphia-based cable company to stay squarely in a media game now dominated by supertankers like Disney-Fox and AT&T, which recently completed its $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner. Mr. Roberts and his advisers began looking at Sky as an acquisition as early as July 2017, long before engaging in the bidding war against Disney for 21st Century Fox assets. Fox's 39 percent stake in Sky was the primary reason that Mr. Roberts went after the company, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy. For Comcast, pursuing Fox was always about building its international businesses. Mr. Roberts cared much less about other assets that the Murdoch family was selling, including the FX and National Geographic cable networks. Cable companies like Comcast, which primarily operates in the United States, have grappled with a decline in pay-TV subscribers who have flocked to streaming services like Netflix. Mr. Roberts, who fashions himself as his company's principal dealmaker, identified Sky as one way to keep Comcast growing. He was particularly taken with Sky's technology. The British broadcaster sells a set-top box that streams its programming over a broadband connection and includes apps like Netflix or Spotify. Sky built the technology to become its key engine for delivering programming, a setup similar to Comcast's Xfinity program. Sky also owns valuable sports rights, including a large chunk of the English Premier League. That was seen as a nice fit with Comcast since its NBCUniversal division owns the American rights to those matches. In addition to sports, the deal gives Comcast some Disney and Fox content. Sky owns streaming rights to films from both studios for the European markets in which it operates for the next two to three years. The British government supervised the weekend auction for Sky, which involved three rounds of blind bidding. Going into the process, analysts like Amy Yong of Macquarie Research put the chances for each side to succeed at 50-50. Commentators on Twitter debated whether the better moniker was SkyBattle or BattleSky.","Gaining control of the British pay-TV company was key for Comcast's future plans, but it came at a steep price and Disney still has 21st Century Fox's assets.",8362f276-4d8a-5c88-8894-83bce7c0ac6d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/24/business/24SKY-web/merlin_80823670_8165ef77-7b6e-4e78-9ebc-a8aa70c86cca-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=f9ac792e49050401fc9520140a92788438ba1ab1c520a53dd9f0a7386c0f406b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Brian L.

Media,Fox News Sexual Harassment Inquiry Is Said to Look at What Others Knew,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/business/media/fox-news-sexual-harassment-inquiry-is-said-to-look-at-what-others-knew.html,"Investigators looking into sexual harassment accusations against the former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes are also examining whether other executives knew of alleged improper behavior by Mr. Ailes and failed to act on it, people briefed on the inquiry said on Wednesday.

The investigation, focused on accusations against Mr. Ailes, has not broadened into a comprehensive look at the workplace culture at Fox News, these people said. But investigators will pursue information presented in interviews about others at the company who might have effectively enabled Mr. Ailes's reported behavior.

The inquiry is continuing, these people said, with more current and former Fox News employees scheduled for interviews. As of last week, nearly 20 women had reported inappropriate behavior by Mr. Ailes, according to one of the people. The accounts, though unverified, led the leadership of 21st Century Fox, Fox News's parent, to determine that Mr. Ailes could not stay on, this person said.

The investigation by the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison began on July 6, the day that Gretchen Carlson, a former Fox News anchor, filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Mr. Ailes. Mr. Ailes, who denied the allegations, stepped down 14 days ago.","Investigators are examining whether other executives failed to report improper behavior by Roger Ailes, the network's former chairman, people briefed on the inquiry said.",1dca4227-ef77-5635-a3f2-23262aec01b5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/04/business/04FOX/04FOX-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=e0d6bbef398f831ef77aef0c2c4a076aa7151c634162ba7e41dd9550633c0eb1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Fox News broadcast booth last week at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.,1dca4227-ef77-5635-a3f2-23262aec01b5,N24News/imgs/1dca4227-ef77-5635-a3f2-23262aec01b5.jpg,16
Automobiles,Triumph Stag: Some Didn't Like It Hot,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/22/automobiles/22RUST.html,"WHAT WAS IT? 1971-73 Triumph Stag.

WHAT WAS THE POINT? In the early 1970s, Triumph tried to go up-market from its Spitfire and TR series and compete with Mercedes-Benz. Like the Mercedes SL, the Stag was a convertible with a removable hardtop and V-8 engine, though the level of its engineering and the quality of its assembly were much inferior.

LABOR PAINS At the time, the British sports car maker was in the grasp of British Leyland, a corporate combine better known for producing labor strife than automobiles. The Stag's problems included its 3-liter Triumph V-8, a virtual hand grenade that routinely overheated and suffered timing-chain failures. Few Stags exist with the original engines.

WHAT THE ADS SAID Triumph advertisements described the engine as ""a big smooth V-8"" whereas it was actually about half the size of a Detroit V-8 of the time. Nor was there much about it that was smooth.

WHAT THE CRITICS SAID In a 1971 test, Road & Track noted that the similarities between the Mercedes and the Triumph ended when one tried to use the car. ""On the Stag, nothing quite works right,"" the magazine reported, noting that the test car had so many examples of poor assembly and shoddy design, ""to enumerate them all would be to belabor the point that true quality of assembly was not one of the Stag's outstanding features.""","In the 1970s, Triumph tried to go up-market with the Stag and compete with Mercedes-Benz, but similarities between the Stag and a Mercedes ended when one actually started driving the Stag.",176d405f-6bd0-5d88-911e-6af57fd8258f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/05/22/automobiles/RUST/RUST-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=302&w=600&s=ee9d675409e733cc51178e7ea523d5434d3674f75f419b5c102a0eb74bd00085&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"MUCH LAMPOONED It is hard to find a Triumph Stag with its original V-8 engine, which was famously troublesome.

Music,Review: The Philharmonic Points a Trippy Kaleidoscope at the Past,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/arts/music/review-new-york-philharmonic-berio-sinfonia.html,"Led here by Semyon Bychkov -- a longtime friend of Berio, who died in 2003 -- ""Sinfonia"" isn't all whimsy. Apart from that riotous patchwork third of its five movements, it's often more soberly unsettled in feel. Within its erratic textures, the vocal octet (here the flexible Roomful of Teeth, in its Philharmonic debut) makes chattering, drooping, bending sounds, and speaks texts by Samuel Beckett and the anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss.

In the second section, ""O King,"" a slightly earlier work repurposed by Berio, the singers softly, unintelligibly enunciate the phonemes of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s name, punctuated by instrumental stabs. Written as a tribute, it became, after King's assassination, an elegy.

""But now it's done, it's over, we've had our chance,"" one of the vocalists says in the third section. ""There was even, for a second, hope of resurrection."" That captures both the witty and wistful sides of the work: It's simultaneously a wink at Mahler's ""Resurrection"" Symphony, which ""Sinfonia"" quotes extensively, and, perhaps, a poignant admission of the darkness into the which the '60s had by then fallen.

The Philharmonic gave a tight performance of the sprawling piece, set -- in an inspired pairing -- alongside Strauss's similarly larger-yet-more-compressed-than-life tone poem ""An Alpine Symphony,"" an evocation of a mountain hike that moves with dizzying facility from boisterous energy to autumnal glow to pummeling darkness. Mr. Bychkov led an easygoing, unpressured -- indeed, often delicate and poised -- voluptuous performance, though the Philharmonic's most distinctive sound remains a hotly screaming super-loudness.","Luciano Berio's ""Sinfonia,"" written for the orchestra in the late 1960s, returned for a run of performances alongside a teeming work by Strauss.",787b2c03-a713-5e63-9d4c-638ee5557ad0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/26/arts/26nyphil1/26nyphil1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=7880110b0f358f33484be9ba05f8809e6653eb7869316fc67d2ebe847a5c1707&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Semyon Bychkov leading the vocal ensemble Roomful of Teeth (inner circle) and the New York Philharmonic in Berio's ""Sinfonia.""",787b2c03-a713-5e63-9d4c-638ee5557ad0,N24News/imgs/787b2c03-a713-5e63-9d4c-638ee5557ad0.jpg,12
Theater,Review: Writer of 'Nassim' Makes a New Best Friend at Every Show,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/theater/nassim-review.html,"When you move to a new city, it's tough to make friends. You can search online communities for meet-ups, strike up fumbling conversations in coffee shops or bother friends of friends, or friends of friends of friends, until they extend invitations. Or you can rent a small theater for four or five months and cajole a bunch of famous and almost-famous actors to hang out onstage with you. You'll even provide snacks.

That is the singular strategy adopted by the Iranian playwright Nassim Soleimanpour. In ""Nassim,"" produced by Barrow Street Theatricals, a different actor bounds onstage every night to open an envelope stashed inside a banker's box. The actor doesn't know what the envelope contains, but I'll give it away: It's the first page of the script, which will eventually unite Mr. Soleimanpour and the actor (some early volunteers include Michael Urie, Michael Shannon, Tracy Letts and Cush Jumbo) in an affectionate double act. Mr. Soleimanpour, who begins his role offstage, is the silent partner.

On the night I attended, the Broadway actress Linda Emond (""Cabaret,"" ""Death of a Salesman""), agreeable and plucky, opened that box. She read the script out loud -- its pages are projected onto a large screen so that the audience can follow along -- and obeyed its stage directions. When prompted, she told some stories. She learned some Farsi. She shared her favorite curse word, ""slutty."" (Does Ms. Emond understand how curse words work?) Occasionally, she ate a cherry tomato.

Mr. Soleimanpour's theatrical style first came to New York a couple of years ago with ""White Rabbit Red Rabbit,"" a play that shares this cold-read conceit. An allegory about authoritarianism, it eventually asks the invited actor to drink from a possibly poisoned goblet. Let's lean on that ""possibly"": Even if you suspend your disbelief from some very sturdy rigging, the likelihood that Mr. Soleimanpour will actually kill off a cluster of Tony nominees seems slim, which gives the play a deceitful, self-congratulatory vibe.","Nassim Soleimanpour, who remains silent throughout, invites a different actor to join him onstage at each performance and star in his unrehearsed play.",a53ccbc9-e9c6-5c80-b9e9-e0cd8e1ce1d5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/18/arts/18NASSIM/17NASSIM-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=6cd8226c4717a633f84fd2ae2dc4f0950e6b466c17bdb38d4a8fa10676b19fba&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Nassim Soleimanpour in his new play, &ldquo;Nassim,&rdquo; now running at City Center Stage II.",a53ccbc9-e9c6-5c80-b9e9-e0cd8e1ce1d5,N24News/imgs/a53ccbc9-e9c6-5c80-b9e9-e0cd8e1ce1d5.jpg,10

Opinion,U.S. Arms Sales and the Yemen War,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/opinion/letters/yemen-arms-trump.html,"Re ""Why U.S. Arms Take Grim Toll in Yemen War"" (front page, May 17):

Jobs tied to arms sales should never be used as an excuse to fuel mass slaughter, as the Trump administration has done with respect to the sale of Raytheon bombs to Saudi Arabia for use in the war in Yemen. But if the president wants to raise jobs as an issue, he should at least get his facts straight.

Arms sales to Saudi Arabia have created 20,000 to 40,000 jobs in recent years, well under one-tenth of 1 percent of total U.S. employment. That's a far cry from the 500,000 jobs tied to Saudi sales claimed by President Trump. Virtually any other expenditure of the same funds -- or any other export -- would create far more jobs than spending on weapons.

Selling arms to repressive regimes is bad foreign policy and bad economic policy. It's time to end U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia, once and for all.

Style,A Panorama of Design,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/style/design-products.html,"This article is part of our latest special report on Design, which is about getting personal with customization. Many regard kudzu as a monster -- an invasive vine that envelops trees and everything else in its path, smothering native species as it spreads. But students at the University of Tennessee's College of Architecture and Design, in Knoxville, recently found uses for the plant and other invasives. In a class led by two architectural designers, Katie MacDonald and Kyle Schumann, the students experimented with turning invasives, which can be harvested during remediation efforts, into building materials. Three students steam-bent the branches of burning bush into curved shapes and then lashed them together with kudzu fibers to create an arched structure. Two others gathered dropped branches of Bradford pear trees and, using the 3-D scanning capability of a smart-phone app, obtained their precise dimensions so they could create custom steel connecting joints, enabling the branches to be assembled into an airy form.

For Ms. MacDonald and Mr. Schumann, the husband-and-wife co-founders of the design studio After Architecture, the class explorations were part of their ongoing research into using technology to transform biological matter into building materials that minimize environmental costs. Milling a tree trunk into standardized lumber uses energy and wastes much of the tree. At the same time, producing molds to create custom forms can be prohibitively expensive. Instead, Mr. Schumann said in a phone interview, the idea is ""to make a customized form informed by the irregularity of the available materials."" JANE MARGOLIES

The theatrical reimagining of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's British decorative arts and design wing was all about thinking creatively, said Wolf Burchard, the collection's associate curator. The interior design firm Roman and Williams, which won a competition for the project, transformed the 10 rooms that make up the Annie Laurie Aitken and Josephine Mercy Heathcote Galleries from neutral white containers to stage sets for 700 objects dating from 1500 to 1900, almost a third of which are new acquisitions. Color (brown aubergine, cloud lavender, straw) and architectural details (arches of different periods divide the centuries) create fresh ways of seeing. Visitors can mount a 17th-century staircase acquired from Cassiobury House, a now-lost Tudor manor, to gaze at the spread of riches from a balcony. And defying convention, three grand 18th-century rooms have not been roped off but may be contemplated from newly designed benches. Referring not just to the glass-and-steel towers holding a dazzling array of 17th-century teapots, Robin Standefer, Roman and Williams's co-founder, said, ""We wanted to let the objects breathe."" The galleries opened on March 2 at 1000 Fifth Avenue; 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org. ARLENE HIRST

The architect and designer Eileen Gray frustrated researchers by burning her diaries and letters, but enough archival material has survived to inform 21st-century exhibitions, films and books. ""Eileen Gray,"" her first major American show since 1980, is on view at the Bard Graduate Center Gallery in Manhattan (with a catalog from Yale University Press). It has been organized with the Centre Pompidou in Paris, which held a Gray retrospective in 2013. Nina Stritzler-Levine, the Bard gallery's director, said the team had dug into Gray's versatility in many mediums and her underappreciated architectural output.

Gray, a scion of Irish aristocracy, spent most of her life in France, where she died in 1976, age 98. She is best remembered for innovative furniture; her 1910s chair with dragon arms sold for about $28 million in 2009 at one of Yves Saint Laurent's estate auctions at Christie's in Paris. E 1027, a modernist vacation house in southern France that she shared with the Romanian-born architect and editor Jean Badovici, has been restored as a museum. She worked on dozens of other architectural commissions as far away as Senegal, Morocco and Mexico, mostly unbuilt, including apartment towers, galleries, theaters, park pavilions and the occasional hotel room and ocean-liner stateroom. Bard is displaying lacquered panels that depict figures in fantastical garb, fringed wool rugs in rectilinear and bull's-eye patterns, metal-and-wood side tables with pivoting drawers, a rocket-shaped floor lamp and architectural drawings and models for an elliptical house and a humpbacked tent. Recently rediscovered film footage in the galleries shows Gray in 1973, reflecting on her works. Given her decades of experimenting and globe trotting, Ms. Stritzler-Levine said, ""She had to have been fearless."" Through July 12, 18 West 86th Street, 212-501-3023; bgc.bard.edu/gallery EVE M.

Travel,36 Hours in Napa Valley,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/travel/what-to-do-in-napa-valley.html,"The venerable vineyards and Michelin-starred restaurants in this California enclave are what everyone comes for. But there are also craft beer breweries, upstart restaurants and, yes , new wineries to explore.

Napa Valley, a delightful landscape of wildflowers and grapevines spread across miles of rolling hills, has been immortalized in film, literature and European wine competitions. As the first and only Agricultural Preserve in the United States, and the first officially designated viticultural area, this small section of Northern California harbors some of the most hallowed wineries and restaurants in the country. But don't call Napa starchy. Along with a cluster of century-old palazzos and chateaus, the area features a growing array of contemporary tasting rooms, hotels, spas and food establishments, many of them opened or refurbished within the last two years. This wave of renewal was delayed in October, when deadly wildfires burned across the North Coast. The majority of Napa's wineries and vineyards (which served as firebreaks) were spared. Some travelers stayed away in the aftermath of the fires, but the valley was soon back on its feet, flaunting a more dynamic and fashionable face than ever.

In Napa County, permits are required to serve food during tastings, which explains why most wineries dispense little more than crackers during their wine flights. But a handful of estates are offering more substantial pairings. At B Cellars, an Oakville winery that unveiled state-of-the-art facilities in 2014, the glass-walled tasting room surrounds a big open kitchen doling out small plates like rabbit rillettes and roasted squash with pickled beets and ricotta. Each dish complements a specific wine; the lineup includes single varietals and blends made from top vineyards within the valley (tour and pairings from $80; by appointment). In nearby Rutherford, Round Pond Estate has several food-and-wine options, from a boozy multicourse Sunday brunch to a lighter pairing showcasing vegetables plucked from the winery's gardens (pairings from $65; by appointment).

Yountville may be the most picturesque small town in the valley, with its pruned trees and brick buildings housing boutiques, bakeries and Michelin-starred restaurants. You may not have a reservation at Thomas Keller's The French Laundry (spots are almost impossible to come by) but you can admire the restaurant's famous vegetable gardens across the street. Then walk over to another Yountville classic, V Marketplace, an enclosed market with cobblestone walkways and shops selling local goods and art. If you're still hungry (or just perennially hungry), grab a quick burger at Platform 8, opened in December by the chef and TV personality Michael Chiarello. And if you want more wine, one of California's most attractive tasting rooms is right in town. At Stewart Cellars' recently opened guest hall, the designer Ken Fulk created a residential atmosphere that displays a mix of vintage finds and custom furnishings (tastings from $30). Napa is no hotbed of discotheques, but the area's night life is getting livelier. Blue Note Napa, a spinoff of New York City's well-known jazz club, opened in late 2016 inside a venerable opera house in downtown Napa. The venue books acts like the Japanese pianist Keiko Matsui and the Hawaiian guitar virtuoso Willie K, and offers stage time to emerging local musicians. An eclectic menu that spotlights California's agricultural bounty is on the playbill too. For a slightly quieter night out, head to nearby Gran Electrica, another East Coast transplant. This new restaurant and bar serves traditional Mexican bites and creative margaritas in a festive space featuring art inspired by Mexico's Day of the Dead holiday. A few blocks away, Miminashi offers wines, sakes and Japanese whiskeys, along with a Rolodex of 125 cocktails.

Napa has a longstanding spa scene. Calistoga, at the northern end of the region, has been drawing mud-bath enthusiasts for decades to its geothermal springs. If you want to relax the old-fashioned way (submerged in a pool of warm mud), your best option is Indian Springs, a Mission Revival lodge and spa whose mud pools contain volcanic ash (baths from $80). For a more modern experience, book a treatment at the Calistoga Motor Lodge and Spa. This midcentury hotel, rejuvenated by the Manhattan design firm AvroKO, has a chic, pastel-hued spa with claw foot tubs for salt baths and a mud bar where you can mix your own concoction before slathering it on and reposing on a gardenside chaise (treatments from $70). Farther south in St. Helena, The Meadowood Spa is one of the most elegant wellness facilities in California (treatments from $225).

The Culinary Institute of America at Copia, planned by the Napa pioneers Robert and Margrit Mondavi, and Julia Child, reopened in late 2016 after an eight-year closure. Visitors to the 80,000-square-foot foodie wonderland can take cooking and wine-tasting classes, get a sneak peek at the personal cookware collection of Williams-Sonoma's founder, Chuck Williams (the full exhibition, consisting of 4,000 pieces, will open next month), or kick back at the restaurant, where a team of chefs behind a sleek open kitchen prepare American classics like steak Diane, pan-seared sirloins served with a deglazed sauce made of shallots, mushrooms, cognac, veal stock and cream ($28). Drive up to Mount Veeder, about 20 minutes from the town of Napa, to see impressive contemporary art at The Hess Collection winery. The founder, Donald Hess, a Swiss businessman and wine producer who began collecting art in the 1960s, was an early patron of several blue-chip artists. His museum, on the second and third floors of the boulder-walled winery (free admission), displays works by the likes of Francis Bacon, Gerhard Richter, Anselm Kiefer and Robert Motherwell.

Craft beers are cropping up in wine country. At least four taprooms have opened in Downtown Napa, including Trade Brewing, a laid-back bar with 14 brews on tap. Try the Bricklayer ($6), a hop-forward American pale ale, or the sturdier Pile Driver ($7), a double I.P.A. with hints of papaya and pineapple. Tannery Bend Beerworks, a nanobrewery and tasting room inside a refurbished tannery, makes tiny batches of classic ales and pilsners as well as experimental varieties. Recently on the menu: a bourbon barrel-aged stout with aromas of figs, plums and vanilla undertones. The San Diego brewery Stone Brewing has unveiled an offshoot in Napa; its new home is the 19th-Century Borreo Building, a stonewalled landmark that had been empty for 15 years. Northern California was at the forefront of the farm-to-table movement that flourished in the early 2000s, and is still a haven for sustainably produced, locally sourced food. The Charter Oak in St. Helena is part of a new generation of restaurants that are honoring this now traditional formula. Christopher Kostow, best known as the executive chef at the three-Michelin-starred Restaurant at Meadowood, is responsible for the approachable menu at this casual yet polished restaurant (interiors display a calibrated hodgepodge of warm wood, exposed brick and tan leather). Much of the food, served family-style, comes from a huge open-flame grill, including beef ribs grilled over cabernet barrel wood, and served with beets ($28).

Downtown Napa once played second fiddle to more scenic locales such as Yountville and St. Helena, but this small city bordering the Napa River has come into its own in the last decade. The Oxbow Public Market is a must-see destination. Few food markets can compete with the variety and quality of the offerings inside this light-filled, 40,000-square-foot structure, where you can see bakers, chocolatiers, butchers and fishmongers at work. Start your tour at Ritual Coffee Roasters, where baristas lavish care on every cup they pour. Then grab a seriously good cinnamon bun at Model Bakery. For a breakfast with views, head to the rooftop restaurant at the Archer Hotel, a much talked-about newcomer. Helmed by the celebrity chef Charlie Palmer, The Sky & Vine Rooftop Bar offers contemporary American fare along with sweeping vistas. Say farewell to Napa with a glass of cabernet or chardonnay at one of the valley's newer wineries. Ashes & Diamonds, owned by the former music producer Kashy Khaledi, has a retro-modern vibe. Already beloved by Instagrammers, the year-old venture off Highway 29 isn't just about looks: Khaledi works with top local grape growers to make wines the old-school way (tastings from $40). In the Stags Leap District, Odette Estate occupies a futuristic recycled steel building that appears to be tucked inside a hill. This environmentally responsible winery specializes in the kind of full-bodied reds that can only come from Napa (tastings from $40). Rancho Caymus Inn (1140 Rutherford Road, Rutherford; from $195), a boutique hotel in Rutherford, unveiled major renovations last summer. The hacienda-style property, built in 1914 by a scion of the Morton Salt family, still features original design elements, including 19th-century white oak beams in its updated rooms and common areas. A pool and a small spa are among the hotel's recent additions. Right outside the town of Napa, Senza Hotel (4066 Howard Lane, Napa; from $300) occupies a newly restored Victorian mansion from the 1870s. The pet-friendly property has 41 guest rooms decorated in a soothing neutral palette, most of them with vineyard views. Senza's heated pool is surrounded by gardens dotted with contemporary sculptures from the personal collection of the owners Craig and Kathryn Hall, the family behind Hall Wines.

Sports,Basketball Is Beside the Point During N.B.A. All-Star Weekend,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/sports/basketball/nba-all-star-charlotte-parties.html,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Consider the following scenes from the N.B.A.'s annual bacchanal/business convention known as All-Star weekend: Spike Lee standing on a street corner waiting for the crosswalk signal. Stan Kroenke, whose family owns the Denver Nuggets, holding court in a hotel lobby. Joel Embiid, the star center of the Philadelphia 76ers, making small talk with the governor of North Carolina. An army of personal stylists waiting to be summoned by their clients for some of the flashiest events of the year. And then there were the agents and league officials and sneakerheads and reporters, some of whom traveled great distances to make unconventional requests of the weekend's main attractions. ""Shout out to my fans in Mongolia!"" John Collins of the Atlanta Hawks yelled into a camera the morning before his appearance in the Saturday slam dunk contest. [Slam Dunk Contest: Hamidou Diallo's Dunk Is Even Better Viewed Frame by Frame] All-Star weekend tends to be a blend of basketball and branding, business and pleasure -- a showcase for a powerful league whose global influence continues to expand.

""The whole weekend,"" Mike Conley of the Memphis Grizzlies said, ""is just a big party."" The All-Star Game itself, scheduled for Sunday night, felt secondary to just about everything else in the host city, as it has for many years. Daryl Morey, the general manager of the Houston Rockets, recalled waiting in line in 2006 for one of the more popular parties at All-Star weekend in Houston, where he watched Maciej Lampe -- a center from Poland who appeared in 64 career games over parts of three seasons -- bypass the line so that he could immediately be waved inside by security. ""And I'm like, 'Man, I'm behind Maciej Lampe?'"" said Morey, who would officially join the front office of the Rockets a little more than six weeks later. All-Star weekend has only grown in recent years. One spreadsheet making the rounds in Charlotte listed more than 100 parties, and that did not include many of the more exclusive events. (Michael Jordan hosted a big one.) Thanks to a change in the league schedule, there is more partying and less deal-making than there used to be. Last year, the league moved the trade deadline up so that it preceded All-Star weekend. In the past, the deadline came a few days after the game, a sequence which helped create its share of absurdity. One of the more notorious examples came in 2017, when word leaked during the fourth quarter of the All-Star Game that the New Orleans Pelicans had struck a deal to acquire DeMarcus Cousins from the Sacramento Kings. Cousins learned of the trade during postgame interviews.

In the corner, a disc jockey who appeared to be in his 60s spun tunes in a Hawaiian shirt and red-tinted glasses, while women wearing bright red dresses passed out hors d'oeuvres. Agents, clients and marketing honchos milled about the room. But none of this is meant to suggest that deals do not get done. On Thursday night, at a downtown hotel bar where patrons sipped $25 cocktails, a crowd of very tall men gathered as a private event wound down at a nearby steakhouse. Among the luminaries who emerged from the event: Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner; Kroenke, who also owns the Los Angeles Rams; Brian Rolapp, the N.F.L.'s chief media and business officer; Bill Simmons, the founder of The Ringer; Connor Schell, ESPN's executive vice president for content; and Bob Myers, the general manager of the Golden State Warriors. ""There are definitely conversations happening,"" Morey said. ""And there's serendipity involved. You're always bumping into people."" Morey was finishing lunch at an upscale restaurant. Warren LeGarie, a longtime agent to many coaches and executives, and Kiki Vandeweghe, the league's executive vice president for basketball operations, were dining at nearby tables. Morey was about to head into a meeting with Vandeweghe and Monty McCutchen, who supervises the league's referees. ""Obviously, we care deeply about where the league is going,"" Morey said, ""so talking to Adam Silver about strategy or Monty McCutchen about changing how they might call certain things -- all that kind of stuff could impact our franchise moving forward, so I try to be involved."" The atmosphere may seem more relaxed than it was two years ago, when most team executives and agents were focused on the trade deadline, but the shift in the schedule has not pushed aside the league's most pressing issues.

In Charlotte, a cloud loomed over the festivities, and it came in the shape of a unibrow. Perhaps you have heard? Anthony Davis, the star center for the Pelicans, requested a trade 10 days before the deadline. The Pelicans, though, rejected all trade offers for him and instead hope to reap better players and draft picks in a deal this summer. Last week, Pelicans Coach Alvin Gentry called the drama of it all a ""dumpster fire."" On Friday, the Pelicans fired their general manager. On Saturday, Davis told reporters that his list of preferred destinations included the Knicks and the Los Angeles Lakers. Hours later, Silver said he would like trade demands and discussions to remain behind closed doors. In any case, the Davis situation only underscored how much the topic of player movement dominates the league -- even in the middle of the season, and even after the trade deadline. Everyone here was fixated on what could happen just over four months from now -- at the start of free agency. Will Kevin Durant leave the Warriors? Will Kawhi Leonard spurn the Toronto Raptors? Will Kyrie Irving bolt from the Boston Celtics? And, again, what about Davis?","At the league's annual showcase, players should bring their sneakers — as long as they match their ties.

Music,"Jan Howard, Singer and Writer of Country Hits, Dies at 91",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/arts/music/jan-howard-dead.html,"Jan Howard performing in 1974 at the Grand Ole Opry's last show at the Ryman Auditorium. She was a member of the Opry cast for 49 years.





NASHVILLE -- Jan Howard, a pioneering woman in country music who wrote and sang about heartache and experienced it herself, died on Saturday at her home in Gallatin, Tenn., near Nashville. She was 91. Her son, Carter, said the cause was pneumonia. Ms. Howard broke into country music at a time when scarcely a handful of women -- Kitty Wells, Patsy Cline and Loretta Lynn among them -- were consistently placing singles on the charts. Originally a demo singer for songs intended for the likes of Ms. Wells and Ms. Cline, Ms. Howard had 20 hit singles in the country Top 40 from 1960 to 1972. Most were made for Decca Records under the renowned producer Owen Bradley.

Although Ms. Howard's biggest hits were recorded with a male duet partner, she cultivated a plucky, resilient persona as a solo artist, singing about infidelity and marital strife at a time when such things were not addressed as frankly as they are now. One of her two Top 10 hits from 1966, ""Evil on Your Mind,"" found Ms. Howard assuming the role of a woman whose husband is trying to ship her off with girlfriends for the weekend so he can be with his mistress. Ms. Howard's character has her doubts. ""Us women are suspicious things,"" she cautions him in a feisty drawl. ""We know that men aren't born with wings."" Later, turning the tables on him, she gives her husband even more to think about, adding: ""Don't think that other men don't look at me that certain way from time to time/Don't think you're the only one who must contend with evil on your mind.""

In a case of life imitating art, ""Evil on Your Mind,"" written by her husband at the time, the country songwriter Harlan Howard, captured the betrayal Ms. Howard would later feel when she found Mr. Howard in bed with another woman. The Howards divorced in 1968, but not before Ms. Howard had established her own voice on dauntless, outspoken hits like ""Bad Seed"" and her own composition, ""Marriage Has Ruined More Good Love Affairs."" Ms. Howard with Bill Anderson, left, and Johnny Cash at a taping of ""The Johnny Cash Show"" in 1971. Ms. Howard and Mr. Anderson recorded four duets that reached the country Top 10. Jan Howard was born Lula Grace Johnson on March 13, 1929, in West Plains, Mo., the eighth of Rolla and Linnie (Shirley) Johnson's 11 children. The Johnsons were a poor farming family; Ms. Howard's father also worked as a brick mason through the Depression-era Works Progress Administration. Raped at the age of 8 by a friend of her father's, she kept the ordeal from her family until she discussed it in ""Sunshine and Shadow,"" her autobiography, published in 1987. ""My body was violated and my mind was damaged in a way I wasn't to know the full extent of for years to come,"" she wrote.

Ms. Howard experienced trauma throughout her life, including the violent deaths of two of her sons. Jimmy, her eldest, was killed by a land mine in Vietnam shortly after Ms. Howard had converted a letter she had written to him, expressing concern for his safety, into a 1968 recording for Decca called ""My Son."" David, her youngest, committed suicide in 1973. Ms. Howard first married at 16 and by 20 had become the mother of three. Divorced at 24 (a brief second marriage was annulled), she moved to Los Angeles in the mid-1950s and married Mr. Howard in 1957. Painfully shy, Ms. Howard always dreamed of singing but lacked the courage to do so in front of an audience. It was only when her husband heard her singing while she was washing dishes that he discovered she had an appealing voice. Mr. Howard soon asked her to sing the demo for ""Mommy for a Day,"" a song he and Buck Owens had written for Kitty Wells, who had a Top 10 hit with it in 1959. Ms. Howard then signed a recording contract with Gene Autry's Challenge label, for which she had two Top 40 country hits. In 1960 ""The One You Slip Around With"" earned her ""most promising country female"" honors from the Jukebox Operators of America. The Howards moved to Nashville later that year. Ms. Howard also signed with Capitol Records but, after one minor hit, switched to Decca, where she would achieve her greatest success, both as a solo artist and with Mr. Anderson.

""So I made the demo on it, and then Harlan came home one day and said, 'Guess who's gonna record ""I Fall to Pieces""?' I said, 'I am,' and he said, 'No, Patsy.' I can't repeat here what I said, but it was not good. And I said I should have divorced him then, but I didn't. ""But Patsy did a great job on it, and I guess it was meant to be.""","A female star in Nashville when there weren't many others, she found success as Bill Anderson's duet partner and as a solo artist singing about the heartache she knew all too well.",25a4ddbe-d329-556c-979c-e3a4d819d2bd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/02/obituaries/31Howard1/31Howard1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=cb0862e06ef7dd0ee1adc9baebadb323bfb896f683cf34c73a829187a95c18cc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Jan Howard performing in 1974 at the Grand Ole Opry&rsquo;s last show at the Ryman Auditorium.

Economy,"Fewer Americans Strike Out for New Jobs, Crimping the Recovery",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/25/business/economy/fewer-workers-choose-to-move-to-new-pastures.html,"A wagon train of American homesteaders moves westward across the open plains, circa 1885. In recent years, fewer people are picking up stakes to seek fresh opportunity, a factor economists say may be weighing on the recovery.

By covered wagon and jetliner, from East Coast to West, Rust Belt to Sun Belt, Americans' propensity to be on the move - to new jobs and new places - has historically provided the economy with a critical dose of oomph. But as fewer and fewer Americans are loading up the moving van in search of opportunity, that advantage may be slipping away. In recent years, economists have become increasingly worried that a slide in job turnover and relocation rates is undermining the economy's dynamism, damping productivity and wages while making it more difficult for sidelined workers to find their way back into the labor force. ""It's possible that one reason people aren't changing jobs is because they've all found jobs that are great for them and they're happy,"" Betsey Stevenson, an economist at the University of Michigan and a former member of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, said. ""But the other possibility is that people stay in jobs that aren't as good for them because they're terrified of changing, and that's bad for the overall economy."" Staying put can mean that workers are not moving to jobs where they would be more productive. At the same time, many are forgoing the raises and ascents on the career ladder that often come with a job switch. Fewer openings can also have a ripple effect, shrinking the bargaining power of workers in general, making it tougher to ask for a bump up in pay.

""It also stinks if you lose your job,"" Ms. Stevenson said of reduced turnover. ""It's like a game of musical chairs where only half the people get up."" The declining churn in the labor market may surprise those who assumed that the era of lifelong employment capped by a gold watch had given way to serial job-hopping. But the reality is more complicated, said Abigail Wozniak, an economist at the University of Notre Dame and one of the authors of a new report on the subject. While it is true that fewer people have very long tenures at a single company, she said, that trend has been swamped by a countervailing one: People are not moving as much out of what used to be entry-level and temporary jobs. Such road-testing of jobs was once very common, particularly for young workers. But now, ""quick turnover jobs are declining across the board,"" Ms. Wozniak said. ""It's not as easy to try things out."" A new analysis by Ms. Wozniak and economists at the Federal Reserve Board to be published soon by the Brookings Institution used a combination of factors -- job shifts, movement in and out of the labor force, interstate migration, job creation and destruction, among others -- to measure what they called fluidity or dynamism in the labor market.

Mobility normally drops during downturns, and that was the case during the Great Recession. Millions of jobs vanished, and those fortunate enough to be working were less inclined to give up the one they had. But even as much of the wreckage wrought by the crash has been cleared, fluidity has not bounced back to prerecession levels. Although there was a common perception that the mortgage crisis had stranded many Americans in place, economists found scant evidence to support that notion. Moving declined similarly among both renters and homeowners. Something else appears to be going on. Moreover, when it comes to mobility, figuring out which is the chicken and which is the egg is not so easy. Is a less fluid labor market causing the economy to be more sluggish or is a sluggish economy causing the labor market to be less fluid? Certainly, movement has declined as the population ages. Older people are less likely to switch jobs and resettle than younger people. The addition of career-minded women into the work force may also make it harder for couples and families to move if only one spouse can find a new job. In addition, fewer new companies are being created over all, and the ones that exist are growing more slowly on average. Still, those explanations don't account for the steep drops in mobility and job turnover found across every age group, educational level and industry. One of the more intriguing findings was the role of declining social trust and what is known as social capital -- the web of family, friends and professional contacts. For example, the proportion of people who agree with the statement, ""Most people can be trusted,"" has been shrinking for more than three decades. Researchers found that states with larger declines in social trust also had larger declines in labor market fluidity. The lack of trust may increase the cost of job-hunting and make both employees and employers more risk-averse.

""The cost of conducting these kinds of checks has declined,"" said Steven J. Davis, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, who has separately researched fluidity. Employers may like it because it helps them more efficiently screen candidates, but it also can make it harder for some potential workers. ""You get fewer second chances now,"" Mr. Davis said.

That can particularly hurt young black men, he said, who have disproportionate contact with the criminal justice system.

Automobiles,"At the Auto Show, Vehicles With a New York Connection",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/automobiles/new-york-state-museum-presents-some-vehicles-at-the-auto-show.html,"Most of the spotlight at the New York auto show is, of course, on the new models on the floor of the Jacob K.

According to the museum, Franklin D. Roosevelt bought the 1932 Packard phaeton that was included in the display to use during his second term as governor. But Governor Roosevelt soon became President Roosevelt, so the car was absorbed into the state's fleet. The museum says the car has been kept in running condition since it was new, although after Gov. Thomas Dewey bought a Cadillac in 1942, it wasn't used much anymore. Gov.

Dance,"Graham, Taylor, Cunningham: Three Titans. One Stage. One Night.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/arts/dance/graham-taylor-cunningham-three-titans-one-stage-one-night.html,"The modern dance tree has many branches, but three of its sturdiest belong to the groundbreaking choreographers Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham and Paul Taylor. Their influence -- on stages, in studios and in schools -- is just as crucial as ever. Squabbles aside -- and, yes, they've had a few -- Graham, Cunningham and Mr. Taylor are tied by choreographic blood. On Sunday, March 19, Paul Taylor American Modern Dance's ""Icons: Graham, Cunningham, Taylor"" grants audiences what seems -- incredibly -- like the first chance to see their work back to back to back. In this one-off program, Mr. Taylor's ""Promethean Fire"" (2002) will be performed alongside Graham's ""Diversion of Angels"" (1948) and Cunningham's ""Summerspace"" (1958). How are the dances related? How did these choreographers forge individual paths? Both Cunningham and Mr. Taylor danced with Graham, who based her vocabulary on the body's expressive reach as it originated in the pelvis. Cunningham, a proponent of using chance operations in his choreographic process, paved the way for explorations of nonrepresentational dance. Mr. Taylor bridges the two worlds, with dances that invest as much in emotion as they do in structure. So why these pieces? Of ""Diversion,"" Mr. Taylor said: ""I knew it was a big one and they could do it."" But he added that neither his dancers nor the Graham company's current ones can perform the contraction, a deep movement initiated in the pelvis, the way it was originally. ""It was deeper and more central,"" he said. ""In the groin, really.""

'DIVERSION OF ANGELS': LOVE IS ALL AROUND As a Graham dancer, Mr. Taylor performed ""Diversion of Angels,"" a rare Graham piece that is light on anguish. Instead, it focuses on three aspects of love: adolescent (represented by a woman in yellow), passionate (a woman in red) and mature (in white). The dance is open to interpretation: Are these three individuals or the same woman at different points in her life? ""Diversion"" begins with the woman in white standing in majestic profile with her lover behind her. The pace picks up quickly as the woman in yellow skims across the floor with the light, darting speed of a butterfly. Linda Hodes, who danced with Graham and Mr. Taylor and staged ""Diversion"" for the Taylor company, gave the cast the imagery of dancing on air. As the Taylor dancer Michael Novak explained: ""She talked about how she feels this dance exists within the ether. Almost to imagine it like you are above the clouds, and you are dancing through them.""

'SUMMERSPACE': AFTERNOON DELIGHT Mr. Taylor's accessibility has often been at odds with the boundary-breaking Cunningham. When Mr. Taylor danced for Cunningham, he said he became disgruntled when Cunningham asked his dancers to choose an object out of a hat. ""According to what object it was, it said who was going to be in the dance,"" Mr. Taylor recalled. ""My object was never picked, so I never got to dance that dance. Afterward I said, 'Merce, is it going to always be this way?' And he said, 'Well, if you don't like it ...' so I said, 'No I don't like it. I'm leaving.' ""

Subtitled ""a lyric dance"" and set to a score by Morton Feldman that shimmers like a summer day, the work transforms the dancers into something more like insects roaming under a warm sky. Each dancer follows a specific path, giving their journeys a feeling of isolation. At certain points, when a trio of women extend their legs in the air and slowly rotate, it takes on an underwater quality. And there are turns. Banu Ogan, the former Cunningham dancer who staged it, said the spine is more vertical in ""Summerspace"" than in later Cunningham dances, which became more complex and technically challenging over time.

""It felt very sparse compared to '90s Cunningham,"" Ms. Ogan said. ""Very few people onstage, very simple movements; yes, it's Cunningham, but there is meant to be a kind of lightness about it. That was a new idea to bring into the work."" Ms. Ogan said she never felt so exposed. ""It's like a poem, where nothing is out of place.""

Its architecture is astounding. Set to Bach, with 16 dancers in black velvet, the work opens on a stark note: Quick falls, strident arms and runs dotted with tiny hops send lines of dancers spinning in agitated coils. Midway through, they raise their arms one by one and fall into a pile; from it emerge a man and a woman. This central duet isn't romantic, but shows how destruction and conflict can morph into hope. A climax comes in a daring leap. Ms. Khobdeh, who hurls herself at Michael Trusnovec, must first run from him. The more distance there is, the more thrilling the jump. ""There's a part of me that feels like I'm trying to escape, like I'm rushing to darkness,"" she said. ""But the moment I turn back and see him, he's this magnet. He wills me to him. It's bringing the darkness into the light."" Mr. Taylor -- at 86, he's the only one living of the three -- has yet to name a successor to lead his company, saying only, ""There's a couple of good possibilities."" The Cunningham company was disbanded after his death in 2009 (its last performance was in 2011), yet his choreography is still being performed. And last month, the Graham company presented, along with repertory by its founder, four new or recent works; three were by European men. Are Graham and Cunningham rolling in their graves? ""I think they may be,"" Mr. Taylor said, with a devilish smile. ""Yep. But you know, their dances were worth seeing and should be seen. So let 'em roll.""",Paul Taylor American Modern Dance is presenting a program featuring these three groundbreaking modern choreographers.,5b1d60f8-b760-5242-bf21-4ddb964f88a1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/19/arts/19TITANS1/19TITANS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=89b15b0d74129ce8ff4679cfb8fa685473c19b89952096a930c5eb3a94c2bb24&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Paul Taylor during a rehearsal with his dance company in 2008.,5b1d60f8-b760-5242-bf21-4ddb964f88a1,N24News/imgs/5b1d60f8-b760-5242-bf21-4ddb964f88a1.jpg,6
Education,"Seeing the Toll, Schools Revise Zero Tolerance",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/03/education/seeing-the-toll-schools-revisit-zero-tolerance.html,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Faced with mounting evidence that get-tough policies in schools are leading to arrest records, low academic achievement and high dropout rates that especially affect minority students, cities and school districts around the country are rethinking their approach to minor offenses. Perhaps nowhere has the shift been more pronounced than in Broward County's public schools. Two years ago, the school district achieved an ignominious Florida record: More students were arrested on school campuses here than in any other state district, the vast majority for misdemeanors like possessing marijuana or spraying graffiti. The Florida district, the sixth largest in the nation, was far from an outlier. In the past two decades, schools around the country have seen suspensions, expulsions and arrests for minor nonviolent offenses climb together with the number of police officers stationed at schools. The policy, called zero tolerance, first grew out of the war on drugs in the 1990s and became more aggressive in the wake of school shootings like the one at Columbine High School in Colorado. But in November, Broward veered in a different direction, joining other large school districts, including Los Angeles, Baltimore, Chicago and Denver, in backing away from the get-tough approach.

Rather than push children out of school, districts like Broward are now doing the opposite: choosing to keep lawbreaking students in school, away from trouble on the streets, and offering them counseling and other assistance aimed at changing behavior. These alternative efforts are increasingly supported, sometimes even led, by state juvenile justice directors, judges and police officers. In Broward, which had more than 1,000 arrests in the 2011 school year, the school district entered into a wide-ranging agreement last month with local law enforcement, the juvenile justice department and civil rights groups like the N.A.A.C.P. to overhaul its disciplinary policies and de-emphasize punishment. Some states, prodded by parents and student groups, are similarly moving to change the laws; in 2009, Florida amended its laws to allow school administrators greater discretion in disciplining students. ""A knee-jerk reaction for minor offenses, suspending and expelling students, this is not the business we should be in,"" said Robert W. Runcie, the Broward County Schools superintendent, who took the job in late 2011. ""We are not accepting that we need to have hundreds of students getting arrested and getting records that impact their lifelong chances to get a job, go into the military, get financial aid.""

Nationwide, more than 70 percent of students involved in arrests or referrals to court are black or Hispanic, according to federal data. ""What you see is the beginning of a national trend here,"" said Michael Thompson, the director of the Council of State Governments Justice Center. ""Everybody recognizes right now that if we want to really find ways to close the achievement gap, we are really going to need to look at the huge number of kids being removed from school campuses who are not receiving any classroom time."" Pressure to change has come from the Obama administration, too. Beginning in 2009, the Department of Justice and the Department of Education aggressively began to encourage schools to think twice before arresting and pushing children out of school. In some cases, as in Meridian, Miss., the federal government has sued to force change in schools. Some view the shift as politically driven and worry that the pendulum may swing too far in the other direction. Ken Trump, a school security consultant, said that while existing policies are at times misused by school staffs and officers, the policies mostly work well, offering schools the right amount of discretion.

""We are not taking these tools out of the toolbox,"" said Russell Skiba, a school psychology professor at Indiana University who promotes disciplinary changes. ""We are saying these should be tools of last resort."" In Broward County, the shift has shown immediate results, although it is too early to predict overall success. School-based arrests have dropped by 41 percent, and suspensions, which in 2011 added up to 87,000 out of 258,000 students, are down 66 percent from the same period in 2012, school data shows. Under the new agreement, students caught for the first time committing any of 11 nonviolent misdemeanors are no longer arrested and sent to court. Rather, they attend counseling and perform community service. Nor do students face suspension for minor infractions. Instead, they also attend a program called Promise for three days or more. Repeat offenders get several chances to change their behavior before more punitive measures kick in. One recent afternoon, an 18-year-old senior sat in the cafeteria at the Pine Ridge Alternative Center, where students are sent in lieu of a suspension, and spoke with a family therapy graduate student on a counseling team. The girl had been caught with a small amount of marijuana in her car on her high school campus, a misdemeanor that would have led to a suspension or arrest in the past. It was the first time she had gotten in trouble at school. ""I was freaking out,"" she said. Her first fear was that she would be barred from prom. Here, though, she saw the larger picture and came to view the incident as ""her second chance."" She learned about bullying and drugs and alcohol. ""It was a slap in the face,"" she said. ""I don't even want to smoke anymore.""",School districts around the country are rethinking their responses to minor offenses by students amid mounting evidence of the downside of get-tough policies.,19b644ce-ee7d-5336-a4d5-64b780bbfc52,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/03/us/jp-03punish/jp-03punish-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=834&w=600&s=e8e5ab65845ceb8895e61dcaa18d7a0f2a274befa3fabc3e84af23865530b0f1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Belinda Hope, principal at the Pine Ridge Alternative Center in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.",19b644ce-ee7d-5336-a4d5-64b780bbfc52,N24News/imgs/19b644ce-ee7d-5336-a4d5-64b780bbfc52.jpg,22
Technology,Amazon's Jobs Fair Sends Clear Message: Now Hiring Thousands,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/technology/amazons-jobs-fair-sends-clear-message-now-hiring-thousands.html,"ROMEOVILLE, Ill. -- Brandon Williams arrived at an Amazon fulfillment center here, about an hour outside of Chicago, around 7:30 a.m. on Wednesday, one of thousands across the country who turned up for the company's first Jobs Day. While he appeared to wilt slightly during the five hours he waited before an M.C. summoned him for a tour, his enthusiasm did not wane. ""What's not great about a company that keeps building?"" he said, seated in a huge tent the company erected in the parking lot as a kind of makeshift waiting room. The event was a vivid illustration of the ascendance of Amazon, the online retail company that, to a far greater extent than others in the tech industry, has a seemingly insatiable need for human labor to fuel its explosive growth. Like other tech giants, Amazon is recruiting thousands of people with engineering and business degrees for high-paying jobs. But the vast majority of Amazon's hiring is for what the company calls its ""fulfillment network"" -- the armies of people who pick and pack orders in warehouses and unload and drive delivery trucks, and who take home considerably smaller incomes.

The event on Wednesday, held at a dozen locations including Romeoville, Ill., was intended to help fill 50,000 of those lower-paying positions, 40,000 of them full-time jobs. Those high-low distinctions did not seem to bother the attendees of the jobs fair, many of them united in the conviction that Amazon represented untapped opportunity -- that a foot in the door could lead to a career of better-compensated, more satisfying work, whether in fulfillment, I.T., marketing or even fashion. Mr. Williams, a military veteran studying computer network security at a nearby community college, said he hoped to eventually work his way up to an I.T. job with Amazon. But even those whose ambitions were more in line with the vast majority of available jobs could not hide their excitement. Victor Salgado, who makes $9 per hour with no benefits doing maintenance at an aerosol company and spent three years before that grouting floors, said he was attracted by the promise of an upgrade in pay and benefits. He said he would be willing to ""do anything"" at Amazon.

Filling so many jobs is challenging, which partly explains the jamboree at Amazon's warehouses on Wednesday. The company's warehouse jobs, which typically pay $12 to $15 an hour, have a reputation as physically demanding and repetitive, with high rates of burnout. Amazon has successfully resisted union organizing that might introduce more worker protections. Amazon has said its wages and benefits are attractive. Five years ago, it introduced a program called Career Choice that pays tuition costs for employees seeking training to join higher-paid professions, like airline mechanics, medical lab workers and computer-aided design technicians. Jack Chasteen, who recently finished high school and is still living at home, said he had been planning to seek a job as a pizza deliveryman but that his parents urged him to turn up at Jobs Day instead. ""They said it would be a good building block for stuff in the future,"" he said, citing Amazon's tuition assistance program, which he hoped might help him pursue a nursing degree. It is indisputable that the growth of e-commerce, which Amazon captures a big chunk of, has devastated many physical retailers, leading to store closures and layoffs. There is debate, though, about how much the corresponding expansion of jobs related to e-commerce has offset the decline in employment at physical stores. Amazon's remarkable head count growth stands in sharp contrast to its image as a job killer. It was the fastest American company in history to employ 300,000 people globally, crossing that threshold last year, its 20th as a public company, according to a paper published this year by the Progressive Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank. Walmart reached that milestone 21 years after it went public, the paper said.

Amazon now has more than 382,000 employees globally. In January, it vowed to create 100,000 jobs over the next 18 months in the United States. It increased its domestic work force from 30,000 employees in 2011 to over 180,000 at the end of 2016. The figures do not include the thousands of seasonal workers that join the company to help it with the crush of holiday shopping. Some come in R.V.s as part of a group Amazon called CamperForce. The company pays for their campsites.

Amazon hired 30,000 new employees in its last quarter alone. Facebook, in contrast, employed just under 21,000 people at the end of June, while Alphabet, the parent company of Google, employed about 76,000. Arun Sundararajan, a professor of information, operations and management sciences at New York University's Stern School of Business, said Amazon's employment needs are unique among tech companies. ""Their business has always been a meld of the digital and physical,"" he said. ""Retail is very different from digital products or music or social networking. The other tech platforms are, at their core, selling tech products."" But there are questions about how long Amazon's fulfillment jobs will exist, as robots and other forms of automation become more capable at doing the jobs that now require humans.",Amazon's nationwide jobs fair on Wednesday offered a vivid illustration of its ascendance and seemingly insatiable need for workers to fuel its growth.,afe5f9e9-9887-5b83-9a60-d91bdf8e916a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/03/business/03AMAZON1/03AMAZON1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=3b163d985591a2d0e5b8620aa9ff38711e5c67f6844bfee811b875cb636e60ef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"In Romeoville, Ill., many people who showed up for Amazon's job fair waited for their turn in a huge tent.",afe5f9e9-9887-5b83-9a60-d91bdf8e916a,N24News/imgs/afe5f9e9-9887-5b83-9a60-d91bdf8e916a.jpg,20
Well,What Donkeys Know About Autism,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/08/well/move/what-donkeys-know-about-autism.html,"Hal Walter always loved donkeys a little more than they loved him. For over 30 years, they've fought, kicked, and confused him -- and for that, he's truly grateful. Donkeys have made his temples throb with fury, but they've also prepared him for the most perplexing challenge of his life: a boy named Harrison. I traveled to Colorado for a tutorial from Hal in the art of burro racing, the old Rocky Mountain sport of running marathon distances alongside a trotting donkey. I became interested in all things burro by necessity, after we adopted a neglected donkey named Sherman and had to figure out what to do with him. When I heard about burro racing, I was intrigued by three mysteries: How has it survived as America's second-oldest marathon, right behind Boston? Why do women and older runners often defeat younger men? And most of all, how do you persuade nature's most obstinate creation that it really wants to run with you? When I arrive at Hal's home among the ranches of Westcliffe, Colo., a fourth item shoots to the top of the list: Why are donkeys so amazing with challenged kids? Harrison Walter thrives in the outdoors, where he spends time with the family donkeys who have adjusted to the special needs of a child with autism. Because as soon as I get out of the car, a curly-blond blur bursts out the door and barrels straight at me. Hal is behind him, calling ""Son. Son. Harrison,"" but nothing about Harrison suggests he's about to listen or ever has.

Harrison is 12 years old and has autism, meaning on his best days he'll sing and tell stories and charm you stupid, and on his worst... well, often that's the same day. A few weeks ago, Harrison was doing great in a middle-school cross-country race when his classmates burst into cheers. Upset by the noise, Harrison veered away from the finish line with 10 yards to go and hid in the bushes. A kind bystander used her golden retriever to lead Harrison to the finish line, which he crossed by rolling over it sideways. At another race, Harrison waded into the spectators, swinging his fists.

Harrison sprints straight past me, a kid on a mission, but that mission, I realize with a jolt of panic, might involve those three mammoth donkeys at the paddock gate. The bars are wide enough for Harrison to dive right through, and judging by his speed, that's exactly where he's headed. Donkeys are notoriously skittish about sudden moves, and their natural reaction is to hammer away with their hooves until the threat is pummeled into the dirt. Donkeys have fought off mountain lions, and even Hal, a seasoned and careful pro, got a nasty nip near his neck last year. But before I can react, Harrison hits the gate. I brace for carnage -- And find Hal reaching out for a handshake.

""I can't explain it except that in their way, donkeys think faster than we do,"" says Mary, Hal's wife. Mary is a nurse and for years was a superb burro racer herself until she was badly hurt in a ""wreck"": her legs got tangled in the lead rope during a race and she fell, spooking her donkey into dragging her through a boulder field. She's learned firsthand that donkeys can bloody you badly without even trying, so she marvels at how protective they are around her son. ""We base our decisions on logic. Theirs are based on sensory perception,"" she explains. ""While we're assembling information in our brains, they're relying on a really keen sense of smell and hearing. Their judgment is amazing and lightning fast.""

Three hours away near Denver, the parents of an epileptic boy wondered if burros could help their 10-year-old son, Ben. After Ben suffered a seizure so severe he had to be hospitalized for a week, his parents, Brad and Amber Wann tracked down Hal's mentor, Curtis Imrie, who invited them to his little ranch outside Buena Vista. ""First time we get there, he takes us five miles straight the hell up Mt. Harvard,"" says Brad, still a little annoyed that he had to walk while Ben got to ride McMurphy, Curtis's most-trusted donkey. ""Fourteen thousand feet!"" ""Why did you name him McMurphy?"" Amber asked. ""After the crazy guy in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'"" Curtis replied, which didn't alarm Amber as much as it should have.

""In my gut, I knew it was O.K.,"" Amber told me. ""As soon as Benjamin was on his back, that burro's ears went up. He looked regal. Like he had a purpose: 'I have this special package to carry.'"" Amber was also thrilled to see Ben so happy. ""I was this depressed mom at home with an epileptic child, and now I'm thinking, This could be it. This animal therapy is for real -- "" ""Craziest thing,"" Curtis says. ""McMurphy goes down in the dirt. I knew what was going to happen next 'cause I've seen it a thousand times. Animal falls, rolls over, comes back up on its feet. That's why so many horse riders break a leg: from the horse rolling over them. But you should have seen McMurphy. He's about to roll and somehow he stops and fights his body back the other way. Some DNA in him to protect that child."" ""It's like he suddenly remembered Ben and went 'Whoops,' and put himself in reverse,"" Brad says. ""I wanted to kiss him."" For the Wanns, that tumble sealed the deal. It's been four years and they've been a dedicated burro clan ever since. They show up at every race, three generations strong; Amber's parents even got a pair of mini-donkeys so they can hike along behind the grandkids. ""Our family doesn't do other sports on the weekend,"" Brad says. ""We do this."" Ben's seizures have disappeared for as long as six months at a time, his parents are delighted to report. ""It's been so cool to see the joy in Ben's face as he gets off the meds,"" says Curtis. ""Burros have brought a measure of sanity to that family."" Like acupuncture and meditation, equine therapy lives in that anecdotal world where plenty of credible people are convinced it works but science can't yet prove why. Curtis Imrie has his own theory. ""Everything about burros is rhythmic. Their breathing, their movements, all 1-2-3-4... 1-2-3-4.... Like the perfect waltz partner. They're desert animals, so that's the way it has to be. Keep your rhythm, keep your cool,"" Curtis explains. ""So Ben comes along and his heart, his breath, all slow to the rhythm. You become what you behold. How's that for a little cowboy philosophy? It's really Huxley but sounds like something from the range.""

Curtis Imrie is considered the dean of burro racing. He hasn't missed a championship race in 40 years. To be fair, Hal Walter has to admit that the burros have helped him as much as his son. ""Pack burro racing was my training for fatherhood,"" says Hal, a seven-time titleholder who still wins at age 56. For years, Hal was a newspaper reporter, and he's captured his evolution as a dad and donkey trainer in two books, ""Full Tilt Boogie"" and ""Endurance."" Burros, he believes, led him to insights he might never have discovered. #1: The only thing you need to do is the thing you're doing: ""Laredo and Boogie taught me the best lesson for dealing with a child like Harrison: You have to have more time than they do. If you're in a rush, you lose."" #2: Lead from the rear: ""You're asking a burro to do something very unnatural. Leave his buddies, leave his food and shelter, and run 30 miles into the mountains. You have to make it seem like it's their idea."" But just when you think you've got things figured out, the rope is ripped out of your hand and you've got an ache in your chest that feels like a kick and you realize that you -- Father of the Year, Mr. Seven-Time Champion -- don't know jack. That's when your old pal Curtis reminds you of the one you forgot: #3: You don't train them. They train you. ""Donkeys know their rights and they can shut you down fast,"" says Curtis.

Movies,'The Platform' Review: An Accidentally Timely Political Allegory,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/movies/the-platform-review.html,"Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia's horror thriller ""The Platform"" has been a regular fixture on Netflix's daily Top 10 since it hit the streaming service last Friday, and no wonder: with its generous helpings of cannibalism, suicide, starvation, blood, guts and feces, how could it not be a crowd-pleaser? A gnarly mash-up of midnight movie and social commentary, the picture is overly overt but undeniably effective, delivering genre jolts and broad messaging in equal measure.

David Desola and Pedro Rivero's screenplay focuses on a brutal experiment in social conditioning and blunt Darwinism. In a vast, vertical prison, each floor consists of a single, small room, inhabited by two cellmates. In the middle of each room, down the center of the building, is a giant hole where a descending meal platform -- a kind of mass dumbwaiter -- stops once a day, for the briefest interval. It is loaded with food and drink at the beginning of its descent, and ""if everyone ate only what they needed,"" an administrator explains, ""the food would reach the lowest levels."" But this is a 200-story prison, so if those on the higher floors stuff their faces (and they all do), things can get more than a little desperate down below.",Netflix's gnarly class commentary certainly isn't subtle.

Theater,Casting Controversy Derailed a High School Play. Then Came the Threats.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/theater/hunchback-of-notre-dame-ithaca-high-school.html,"Ciara Renee as Esmeralda in a 2015 production of ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey.

It started as a local debate over a New York high school production of the musical ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame."" A white teenager was cast in the lead role of Esmeralda, a 15th-century Roma woman, spurring young student activists to object. Last month, after much discussion in the community, Ithaca High School pulled the show, aiming to replace it with something else. But the story doesn't end there. Those same students are now besieged by an online mob targeting them with threats and racial epithets after the incident was reported in right-wing publications like Breitbart News, then spread to the neo-Nazi site The Daily Stormer. Via Facebook, the students received pictures of themselves with swastikas plastered on their faces. One parent had what was thought to be her home address (it wasn't) posted online with a comment seeming to encourage harassment: ""Do your thing social media."" Another parent received a profane email, assailing her for embracing ""anti-white racism,"" adding: ""I feel sorry for your brainwashed child.""

Ithaca High School, in upstate New York, was to stage the musical, based on the 1831 novel by Victor Hugo and the 1996 Disney animated film, in mid-April. In Hugo's book, it is unclear whether both parents of Esmeralda are Roma. Also known as Gypsies, Roma are descendants of migrants who arrived in Europe from India more than a millennium ago. They have historically been disparaged across the continent, with many remaining impoverished to this day. And while two productions of the new musical -- its premiere at the La Jolla Playhouse in California in 2014 and one in 2015 at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey -- gave the part to a woman of color, Ciara Renee, the casting calls for those shows invited actresses of all ethnicities to audition for the role. Music Theatre International, the licensing company that holds the rights to ""Hunchback,"" says that Esmeralda is a female, aged between 20 and 30, and that she is a ""beautiful and free-spirited gypsy who possesses the strong sense of justice and morality."" But in the Disney film, Esmeralda has a dark complexion. And that is the version that Ithaca High School students grew up watching. That depiction, plus the precedent of Ms. Renee's casting, led some to believe the part would go to one of the high school's students of color, who make up 34 percent of the student body. Maddi Carroll, a 17-year-old African-American senior, said the high school's staging of ""Hunchback"" was initially exciting to her ""because we didn't feel like our high school usually put on productions with women of color in starring roles."" ""We were talking about us being younger and thinking about Disney princesses we had to look up to. For us, we really had Jasmine and Esmeralda,"" she added, referring also to the ""Aladdin"" character.

In January, Annabella Mead-VanCort, a senior who did not audition for the play, wrote a letter to Tompkins Weekly, a local publication, and had more than two dozen co-signers. It asserted that Esmeralda was accurately depicted in the Disney film and that the part was written for a young woman of color. ""Esmeralda is a Roma, part of an oppressed class of people,"" she wrote. ""It is her oppression, and that of her people, which allows her to better understand the perspective of the Hunchback and to ultimately advocate for him."" After the outcry, the school board held a community meeting on Jan. 23, when a number of students showed up wearing black in solidarity with the young activists, including Prachi Ruina, who had auditioned for the musical, and was cast in the ensemble. ""I call upon you to stop this musical now,"" she said to the board. ""You tear a community apart if you don't."" The next day, the school board announced that ""Hunchback"" would be pulled and a new production would be proposed. Mike Ellis, the father of the young actress who was originally cast as Esmeralda, said in an interview about the students' protest: ""Even though it involved a sacrifice on my daughter's part, I think the questions that they're asking are good, important questions that any school should want to ask itself.""

The events were reported on Jan. 29 in The Ithaca Journal. On Feb. 5, Breitbart picked up the news, writing that Esmeralda's race ""shouldn't matter."" The publication has covered Hollywood's recent casting controversies, including accusations of whitewashing when a white actor was cast in the film ""Hellboy"" to play a character portrayed as Asian in the original comic book. The Daily Stormer published a post about the high school's decision. Mainstream national outlets, including Fox News and The Washington Times, amplified the conversation. The comments online became ugly. On a 4chan, an anonymous message board, one post said that the students ""need to be 'dealt' with."" The Students United Ithaca Facebook page was particularly vitriolic, with some members receiving private messages saying, ""You are the real Nazis of this country,"" and ""You're a pathetic racist scum group."" Ms. Ruina was told to go back to India. On Facebook, one African-American student's personal page was tagged in a public comment that used a racial epithet, saying he ""is the reason we are looking for trees."" The student interpreted this as a threat of lynching. The Ithaca High School principal didn't respond to a request for comment, nor did the school district's superintendent. Dr. Sean Eversley Bradwell, vice president of the Ithaca Board of Education, wrote in an email that the board was ""very concerned about the level of vitriol directed at our students."" He also said the district had received more than 100 angry voice mail messages and 50 emails. The trolling has been taxing for the students. ""This is very, very surreal,"" Ms. Carroll said, adding, ""It's a lot to handle as a 17-year-old who is in high school right now, applying to college, trying to get ready for that stuff.""","After Ithaca High School canceled its production of ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" because of students' pushback, an online mob targeted the town.",5e9cdcd4-69a6-5ae5-807d-67d52aedb164,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/09/arts/09hunchback-3/merlin_93374896_e7c2e8ea-6643-4e68-b21b-af3d7773f2f5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=adfc626e85af050a7f6a4fb603c8813e958fc5b941a0e8888b54615924302c7b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ciara Renée as Esmeralda in a 2015 production of ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey.",5e9cdcd4-69a6-5ae5-807d-67d52aedb164,N24News/imgs/5e9cdcd4-69a6-5ae5-807d-67d52aedb164.jpg,10
Science,Fossils on an Australian Beach Reveal a Shark-Eat-Shark World,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/09/science/sharks-fossils-australia.html,"In 2015 Philip Mullaly was strolling along a beach in Victoria, Australia, when he spotted what looked like a shining serrated blade stuck in a boulder. Using his car keys, Mr. Mullaly carefully pried from the rock a shark tooth about the size of his palm. He didn't know it at the time, but the tooth he uncovered once belonged in the mouth of a 25-million-year-old giant shark that was twice the size of a great white.

""It was an awesome creature, it would have been terrifying to come across,"" Mr. Mullaly said.

Though Mr. Mullaly, who is a schoolteacher and amateur fossil hunter, has collected more than a hundred fossils, he never before found a prehistoric shark tooth. He returned to the boulder a few weeks later and to his surprise dug up several more three-inch teeth.

""It dawned on me when I found the second, third and fourth tooth that this was a really big deal,"" said Mr. Mullaly.

Real Estate,Act III for a Lower Manhattan Landmark,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/realestate/act-iii-for-a-lower-manhattan-landmark.html,"Plenty of historic office buildings have been converted to residential use in recent years -- especially in Lower Manhattan, where some of the oldest commercial structures in New York stand. The latest building to undergo such a transformation is the Clock Tower Building, which is now being called 108 Leonard. Completed in 1898 as the headquarters of the New York Life Insurance Company, the 16-story building occupies an entire city block with its grandest portion, fronting on Broadway, designed by McKim, Mead & White -- the starchitects of their day. The white marble facade is lavished with lion heads, balustrades and other flourishes drawn from Italian Renaissance palazzos, and the whole thing is topped by a three-story pavilion with a mechanical timepiece that gave the structure its nickname.

""The building is a significant, massive work of art,"" said John H. Beyer, a founding partner of the architectural firm Beyer Blinder Belle, which has worked on restoring several McKim, Mead & White structures. His practice has been involved in the restoration and renovation of 108 Leonard, which will yield more than 160 condos and a raft of amenities, from an underground motor court to a rooftop Zen garden.

Not that the process has been easy. After New York Life moved to Madison Square in the late 1920s, the City of New York acquired the building, also known as 346 Broadway, to house courts and government agencies. By the time a partnership involving developers Elad Group and the Peebles Corporation bought the building in 2013 for $145 million, it had been declared a national and city landmark. New York City's Landmark Preservation Commission extended landmark status to 10 distinct portions of the interior, including the president's suite on the fourth floor, with its nearly 500-square-foot anteroom paneled in gray-veined marble.

In its reimagining of most of the interior for residential use, Beyer Blinder Belle decided to relocate the anteroom. With the blessing of the landmarks commission, the developers had the room dismantled and the pieces sent off-site for refurbishment. They will be returned to the building and fitted back together -- but on the ground level, where the space will be ""a library/working area /entertaining area,"" said Samantha Sax, chief marketing and design officer for Elad. How does Broadway rebound? Join us virtually as we visit the now bustling theaters to find out. Go inside rehearsal of the Tony Award-winning ""Hadestown,"" enjoy ""Girl From the North Country"" songs and more. Under city law, an interior landmark is supposed to be open or accessible to the general public regularly. But the ante room and some other interior landmark spaces will only be open to residents.

The Clock Tower in particular has been a sticking point for the developers, because they have sought to turn it, with its landmark mechanical works, into a condo unit. Their plan would involve electrifying the iconic four-sided timepiece -- which was rewound weekly by a small, dedicated group of clock aficionados after the clock was restored in 1980 -- so no one need intrude on what would be a private home. While the Landmarks Preservation Commission supports the plan, opponents to the clock tower conversion sued and won a 2016 court ruling that said the mechanical works must be kept in their original condition. The city's law department has appealed on behalf of the landmarks commission, which has also agreed to let the developers turn the rest of the elaborately paneled president's suite into a private apartment.

Meanwhile, work continues. The exterior restoration firm HLZA used nylon brushes to scrub the facade of the building, which extends east to Lafayette Street, south to Catherine Lane, and north to Leonard Street, where the building's main entrance will be. They replaced damaged portions of the roof parapet, repaired scars left after old metal fire escapes were removed (in favor of new code-compliant staircase cores) and restored the fierce-looking 7,000-pound eagles that perch on the roof.

On the floors above, space is being divided into apartments -- with ceiling heights that far exceed the norm. On most floors they range from over nine and a half feet to over 14 feet, and Jeffrey Beers International, which is in charge of interior design, is adding tray ceilings with cove lighting in nearly all units, which is sure to make them look even higher. In the most luxurious apartments, on the top three floors, the ceilings can be up to 15 feet, and most units have terraces. Sales began in February, and buyers should be able to begin moving in the spring of 2019, according to Ms. Sax. Units range from $1.435 million for a one-bedroom to over $20 million for a 5-bedroom, 6-bath triplex penthouse -- and a chance to own a piece of New York history.","It was originally home to an insurance company, then to city courts.

NEW YORK AFRICAN FILM FESTIVAL at various locations (through June 9). After starting on May 23 with a program at BAM, the 26th edition of the annual New York African Film Festival expands to Film at Lincoln Center in the coming week before concluding at the Maysles Cinema in June. Among the highlights are screenings of the Malian director Souleymane Cisse's ""Baara"" (on Monday), first shown in 1980, about a factory manager who has a crisis of conscience, and ""Sarraounia"" (on Tuesday), directed by the Mauritania-born filmmaker Med Hondo, who died in February.

JULIA REICHERT: 50 YEARS IN FILM at the Museum of Modern Art (through June 8). ""American Factory"" (on June 7), a look at what happened when the Chinese glass company Fuyao took over a closed General Motors factory near Dayton, Ohio, was a highlight of this year's Sundance Film Festival. But that film, directed by Reichert and Steven Bognar, is just one entry point into Reichert's long career as a documentarian, and this retrospective is a cross-section of American social issues. ""Methadone: An American Way of Dealing"" (on Saturday and Thursday), co-directed with Jim Klein, centers on the clients of a Dayton methadone clinic, many of them factory workers who have turned to drugs as a coping mechanism. Reichert's debut, ""Growing Up Female"" (also with Klein, showing on Saturday and June 8), examines the gender stereotypes applied to women in the early 1970s.

Books,"Martin Mayer, Prolific and Protean Author and Critic, Dies at 91",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/books/martin-mayer-dead.html,"Martin Mayer, an author, journalist and critic of remarkable diversity who wrote more than 40 books and hundreds of articles for laymen that demystified lawyers, banking, thorny school problems and the raptures of classical music, died on Thursday at his home on Shelter Island, N.Y. He was 91. Mr. Mayer's son Thomas said the cause was respiratory complications of Parkinson's disease. Martin Mayer called himself an old-time freelancer, batting out 1,000 words a night before dawn. But for a half-century, Mr. Mayer was a Renaissance man of letters, taking readers on behind-the-scene tours of Wall Street, Madison Avenue, the practice of law, the solemn delights of a Spanish guitar and the tangles of a racially divisive New York City teachers strike. Along the way, he churned out three novels; wrote columns for Esquire magazine; was a music critic for a British journal; wrote for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and a dozen other periodicals; composed reports for the Ford, Carnegie and Kettering Foundations; was chairman of a local school board in New York; and served on White House panels in the Kennedy and Reagan administrations. A free-spirited son of two New York City lawyers, Mr. Mayer entered Harvard in 1943 at age 15 under an experimental program. It was a mistake. He and his roommate exploded a chemical concoction outside a college gymnasium as Naval trainees ran up one morning. (No one was hurt.)

""Dad was a terrible student,"" Thomas Mayer wrote in an email. ""He said they canceled the program after he was admitted. He played way too much poker and bridge, paid attention only to courses that interested him, almost never got out of bed before noon, and wrote for The Harvard Crimson under an assumed name (I think Moriarty) because he was almost always on probation."" He did not graduate with the class of 1947, as listed in biographies. ""He failed to pass the requirement of a foreign language and left without a degree,"" his son said. ""First he tried Russian, then he tried German, and finally passed Italian and got his degree two years late."" In a 1966 autobiographical sketch, Mr. Mayer acknowledged his academic shortcomings. ""My field was economics and I also worked in philosophy and music,"" he said. ""But such statements give an inaccurate impression: most of my time went to the wartime version of The Harvard Crimson, to tournament bridge, poker, horse racing, one or two young ladies and totally unsupervised reading."" Mr. Mayer explored banking in a 1975 best seller. He produced a sequel about banking in the computer age in 1997, ""The Bankers: The Next Generation."" After college, he edited a scholarly labor publication, a pulp detective magazine and paperback Westerns. Landing at Esquire in 1951, he edited fiction, wrote articles and finished his first novel, ""The Experts"" (1955), about the intrigues of an ambitious politician. Then he embarked on what he called the nonfiction writer's dream -- ""writing pretty much what I want to write, as I want to write it.""

Many of his books examined familiar professions and institutions, with titles like ""Madison Avenue, U.S.A."" (1958), ""Wall Street: Men and Money"" (1960), ""The Schools"" (1961), ""The Lawyers"" (1967), ""About Television"" (1972), ""The Bankers"" (1974), ""The Builders: Houses, People, Neighborhoods, Governments, Money"" (1978) and ""The Diplomats"" (1983). The titles made them sound perhaps like quickie surveys, but they proved to be serious books, often years in the making, that treated complex subjects with respect if not total justice. Reviewers and professionals often cited oversimplifications and said readers might be misled. The very title of ""The Lawyers,"" for example, suggested to one reviewer a wallow into the murkier gimmicks of the legal profession. ""It is nothing of the kind,"" Thomas Lask observed in The Times, noting that the author devoted five years to the book. ""It is a highly researched, many-faceted presentation of what a lawyer is, how he is trained, what he does to earn his money, how many different kinds there are, what opportunities are open to him and how he makes out financially in comparison to the rest of us."" Mr. Mayer's dissection of Madison Avenue won The New Yorker's nod of approval for his ""skill in assimilating his findings, organizing his material and presenting it, with a nice leavening of anecdote, illuminating shoptalk and fascinating lore."" One of Mr. Mayer's most ambitious projects detailed New York's 1968 teachers strike, a crisis over decentralization that closed the city's public schools when a newly created community school board in the largely black Ocean Hill-Brownsville section of Brooklyn fired many white, mostly Jewish teachers and administrators. The teachers' union demanded reinstatements. Families boycotted the schools. Chaos and violence erupted, and accusations of racism and anti-Semitism swirled for months. Mr. Mayer's 23,000-word recapitulation in The New York Times Magazine, and a follow-up book, ""The Teachers Strike: New York, 1968"" (1969), were largely criticized along partisan lines. But Murray Kempton, in a New York Post column, ""Homage to Martin Mayer,"" wrote, ""What counts is that Mayer has pursued the details; even those of us who argue with him are in his debt for that risk."" Despite some negative reviews, Mr. Mayer's ""The Bankers"" was a best seller in 1975, and his computer-age update, ""The Bankers: The Next Generation"" (1997), was a hit with readers and critics. Jennifer Kingson Bloom, in The American Banker, called the sequel ""the first popular book to examine what it means to be a banker in the age of electronics and mergers.""

And Peter Passell, in The Times, hailed Mr. Mayer's ""erudite, witty and only occasionally jargon-choked observations."" The book, he said, ""can be heavy going for the uninitiated. But that's just Mr. Mayer showing off. Follow his usually delightful ramble through the boardrooms and byways of high finance, and you'll learn more than you ever thought you wanted to know."" Martin Prager Mayer was born in Manhattan on Jan. 14, 1928, the only child of Henry and Ruby (Prager) Mayer. His parents represented labor unions and left-wing causes. Martin attended public elementary schools and McBurney, a now-defunct prep school for boys run by the Y.M.C.A. ""I literally cannot remember a time when I was not writing something essentially for my own satisfaction, but also with confidence of the grace that others were going to read it,"" Mr. Mayer told World Authors. ""Politically I was brought up on the non-Communist left, and I stay there, though sometimes uneasily."" In 1949, Mr. Mayer married Ellen Moers, an author and professor of literature. She died in 1979. In 1980, Mr. Mayer married Karin Lissakers, a Swedish-born writer and former State Department official who subsequently became the United States executive director of the International Monetary Fund. In addition to his son Thomas, from his first marriage, Mr. Mayer is survived by his wife; another son from his first marriage, James; two children from his second marriage, Fredrica and Henry; and five grandchildren. Mr. Mayer, who also had a home in Manhattan, golfed and swam for years, reserving late nights for writing. Often that writing was about music.","In dozens of books and a torrent of articles, writing into the wee hours, he demystified lawyers, banking, advertising, builders, classical music and much more.",5a8a3c7a-3c67-5d4c-a46b-04cab514e0a9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/02/pageoneplus/02mayer-printSUB/02mayer-printSUB-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=f4884a8581af03c41da200a7239675dc742bbaa8cdbaf7c6f926c29205e591dd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Martin Mayer in 1988.

Music,Grammys President Faces Backlash After Saying Women Need to 'Step Up',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/arts/music/grammys-step-up-neil-portnow-backlash.html,"In the days after the Grammy Awards, some griping about the winners can always be expected, with debates in recent years focusing on racial diversity and the institution's relationship with hip-hop. But following the 60th annual Grammys on Sunday, two words uttered backstage by Neil Portnow, the president of the Recording Academy, ignited a controversy that has drawn rebukes from some of the most powerful women in music at a particularly fraught time, amid the #MeToo and Time's Up movements against harassment and professional inequality. Asked about the gender representation among winners on the televised portion of the awards, during which just one woman was given a solo Grammy, Mr. Portnow told reporters that ""women who have the creativity in their hearts and souls, who want to be musicians, who want to be engineers, producers, and want to be part of the industry on the executive level"" need to ""step up."" The comments, first reported by Variety, spread quickly online and gave a viral push to the budding hashtag #GrammysSoMale.

Others even called for Mr. Portnow, who assumed his position in 2002, to step down, leading to its own hashtag. The rapper Iggy Azalea also raised the possibility of a Grammys boycott, writing on Twitter that ""women should consider if we NEED to take firmer action and stay at home in PJs next year... see how that works out for Neil.""

In a statement sent to The New York Times on Tuesday, Mr. Portnow clarified the comments, which he said were taken out of context and ""do not convey my beliefs and the point I was trying to make."" ""Our industry must recognize that women who dream of careers in music face barriers that men have never faced,"" he said. ""We must actively work to eliminate these barriers and encourage women to live their dreams and express their passion and creativity through music. We must welcome, mentor and empower them. Our community will be richer for it. ""I regret that I wasn't as articulate as I should have been in conveying this thought,"" Mr. Portnow added. ""I remain committed to doing everything I can to make our music community a better, safer and more representative place for everyone.""

Concerns over gender diversity in the industry were brought to the forefront just before the Grammys, with the release of a report by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative at the University of Southern California. The report found that of the 899 people nominated in the last six Grammy Awards, just 9 percent were women. And in analyzing the top Billboard songs from 2012 to 2017, the group reported that women made up only 12 percent of songwriters and 2 percent of producers. Helienne Lindvall, a songwriter and former columnist for The Guardian, where she wrote about the changing music industry, said in an interview that women in the business need to be not only encouraged, but promoted. ""When I look at the generation coming up, there are women in more technical positions, like remixers and producers,"" she said. ""We need to show that it is not a strange thing for a woman to be a producer.""

The diversity report's stark statistics were borne out at Sunday's ceremony, when Alessia Cara became the only woman to collect her own trophy on stage, for best new artist. (Rihanna won as a featured artist on the Kendrick Lamar song ""Loyalty."") Lorde, the only woman nominated for album of the year, which ultimately went to Bruno Mars, did not perform or appear onstage. And the televised category featuring the most female nominees, best pop solo performance, went to Ed Sheeran, who was not present, over Pink, Lady Gaga, Kesha and Kelly Clarkson.

George Howard, an associate professor of music business and management at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, said in an interview that the music industry could be seen as ""a microcosm of our country"": ""Any institution that is founded upon a firmament of endemic racism and misogyny ultimately crumbles,"" he said. ""The institution of the Grammys has to have its day of reckoning,"" he added. ""But more importantly, the music industry itself has to have its day of reckoning.""","Neil Portnow, the president of the Recording Academy, said his comments were taken out of context, but Pink, Katy Perry and Sheryl Crow had already responded.",342c51d4-43bd-59d2-985c-013855f69409,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/31/arts/31grammy-portnow/31grammy-portnow-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=d0b8fe5ad03d56c35caa10b93195bb398299b509dded6cb8fadad6d024e1ebd9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Recording Academy president Neil Portnow, right, with Grammys host James Corden.

Fashion & Style,The Latest Piece of Alexander McQueen Memorabilia: A London Penthouse,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/fashion/alexander-mcqueen-penthouse-london.html,"The enduring fascination with the life of Alexander McQueen shows no signs of slowing, more than six years after his death and five years after ""Savage Beauty,"" the blockbuster retrospective exhibition of his work at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute.

Last month, the announcement of an as-yet untitled movie on Mr. McQueen, the British designer who committed suicide in 2010, and his penultimate catwalk collection generated great fanfare, in part because the rising star, Jack O'Connell, will be taking the title role. And this past summer, news that a Central St. Martins student was working on a project that could use Mr. McQueen's DNA to grow skin for an artificial leather goods range, again stoked interest in a man who loved to shock, one of the most feted and contentious designers of his generation.

""People remain completely intrigued about Lee, partly because of the drama, excitement and tragedy that whirled around him in both life and death, but also because he was a rare genius -- one of a handful of designers, alongside Martin Margiela and Rei Kawakubo, whose first collection set the mood of the wider industry for years afterwards,"" Tony Glenville, creative director at London College of Fashion, said, referring to the designer by his first name. ""People recognize that he had a creative flair that changed the fashion industry forever. It's not surprising so many people want to find ways to keep experiencing that force in some way.""","A duplex in the Mayfair neighborhood, decorated in homage to Mr. McQueen, is on the market for $10.6 million — even though he never lived there.",ea2211ae-0c9a-5ef7-bb6d-0311dd706d2b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/16/fashion/16OTR-01web/16OTR-01web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=b2eaebad611976e65933740b4facbc69d41a061e78084d83612ef60248898f11&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The reception room of the Mayfair penthouse formerly owned by Alexander McQueen.,ea2211ae-0c9a-5ef7-bb6d-0311dd706d2b,N24News/imgs/ea2211ae-0c9a-5ef7-bb6d-0311dd706d2b.jpg,19
Art & Design,Russ & Daughters History Goes on Display,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/arts/design/russ-daughters-center-for-jewish-history.html,"Don't expect a platter of herring and bialys. But prepare to be hungry anyway at the new ""Russ & Daughters: An Appetizing Story"" exhibition produced by the American Jewish Historical Society at the Center for Jewish History in Manhattan.

The exhibition, which is free and opens to the public on Friday , aims to teach visitors about the Russ & Daughters appetizing shop on the Lower East Side and its impact on New York's rich food and cultural history.

Joel Russ's first shop opened on Orchard Street in 1914. A few years later, he moved the store to its current location on East Houston Street. He had no sons and eventually named his three daughters as partners -- changing the name J.R. Russ Cut Rate Appetizers to Russ & Daughters. The fourth generation of Russes now operates that shop and others.

Annie Polland, the executive director of the A.J.H.S., said she wanted to create an exhibition to share the Russ family's archives, as well as artifacts from the historical society's collection.","""Russ & Daughters: An Appetizing Story,"" from the American Jewish Historical Society, offers a taste of New York's rich food and cultural history.",fd2f50e4-04b8-54c2-98d7-218613bffddb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/12/arts/12russ-daughters-item/12russ-daughters-item-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=864a2e9c5057d35c2dadc5590c5f8195fc0958a82f470481edca5bac281a6459&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Nina Gold, daughter of Joel Russ's daughter Hattie, at the Russ &amp; Daughters shop.",fd2f50e4-04b8-54c2-98d7-218613bffddb,N24News/imgs/fd2f50e4-04b8-54c2-98d7-218613bffddb.jpg,14
Fashion & Style,Grateful for a Wedding in Prison,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/fashion/weddings/grateful-for-a-wedding-in-prison.html,"On the day Chelsea Moore got married, it had been six months since she last saw her fiance, Christopher Blackwell. But now Ms. Moore, wearing a mask assigned to her, stood on a designated spot six feet from her soon-to-be husband. The room was empty save for a few chairs and tables and other seemingly storage-bound items haphazardly strewn about and a backdrop depicting a walking bridge in the woods in the early fall. On Sept. 18, Ms. Moore and Mr. Blackwell were married in the visitors' room at the Washington State Reformatory in the Monroe Correctional Complex, where he is a prisoner.

Mr. Blackwell, 39, is serving two sentences. The first is for a robbery, for which he was convicted in 2003 and sentenced to eight years. The second is for the murder of 17-year-old Joshua May during a home invasion in 2003. Mr. Blackwell was convicted of first-degree murder and received a 38-year prison sentence in 2007. There is no parole in Washington State. He will be released in 2045. He grew up in the Hilltop neighborhood of Tacoma, Wash., which was known for its gang violence in the late 1980s and is now being gentrified. He was incarcerated for the first time when he was 12 for stealing a car and would spend the next six years of his life in and out of jail. While incarcerated, Mr. Blackwell has received a general associate degree from Seattle Central College and is several classes away from a bachelor's degree in political science from Adams State University, which is in Alamosa, Colo. He writes about his experiences in prison and his work has appeared in BuzzFeed, the Marshall Project and Jewish Currents. Ms. Moore, 32, who grew up in the wealthy community of Ojai, Calif., which she describes as ""hippie town nestled in the mountains and known for being a geomagnetic vortex that attracts eccentrics and mystics,"" is a Ph.D. candidate in political science at the University of Washington. She expects to complete her degree in the next couple of months. Ms. Moore also just started law school at the University of Washington where she is also an instructor and teaching assistant.

It is her aim, she said, to use her education to ""do post-conviction review work for people with long sentences."" The pair first crossed paths when Ms. Moore volunteered to teach a constitutional law civil liberties class at the prison in the summer of 2017. Mr. Blackwell was in the class. Ms. Moore was still finishing her dissertation and interested in criminal justice work when she met his mother, Connie Palmersheim, in February 2019 at a community meeting in Seattle for those interested in sentence reform and parole legislation. The random connection seemed like kismet to Ms. Moore. ""She told me a bit about what Chris was up to and encouraged me to reach out to see if I could help at all,"" Ms. Moore said in reference to his writing.

Their friendship grew through prison email, but, ""really it was snail mail where we first started to fall in love,"" she said. ""We have binders and binders full of letters we've written to one another."" Their connection grew over music, movies and books. ""We'd send each other songs to listen to that remind us of each other. We sometimes do a book club. We can watch movies together over cable and will write back and forth about them."" After they had begun corresponding, the pair were disheartened to learn there was a Washington Department of Corrections policy that did not allow former volunteers to be on a prisoner's visitation list for three years after the date they stopped volunteering. They set out to change the policy. ""Through a lot of advocacy and persistence we were able to change the wait to a year instead of three years,"" Ms. Moore said. The new policy went into effect in November 2019, though it has not been posted on the D.O.C. website. Although neither can remember the precise moment they knew they were in love, both were sure that's precisely what it was. Mr. Blackwell says knowing that Ms. Moore had read through his 360-plus-page juvenile record, and still wanted to be with him, made him sure she was the one. There was no formal proposal, although she said he did ""kind of"" propose after writing a list of the 50 things he loved about her. They decided in January 2020 that they wanted to get married.

Megan Rose Donovan has been a close friend of Ms. Moore since 2008, when both were at Occidental College. She said what Ms. Moore needs now ""is a friend to confide in and someone who won't pass immediate judgment."" ""I also understood that Chelsea's decision to marry Chris would likely create tension in some of her other relationships with friends and family,"" she added. ""So when she told me that they would be getting married I thought, ""OK, pretty much everyone in this woman's life is going to have a negative reaction to their relationship."" That very same month, the couple began the long process of applying with the corrections department to get married. But then the coronavirus pandemic struck and a difficult process became a near impossible one. No prison visitation was allowed -- just three months after she had begun regularly visiting him -- and virtual marriages were not legal in the State of Washington at the time.

In May, they received and signed a marriage packet (which was separate from a marriage license) from the Department of Corrections. ""The D.O.C. application requires me to say whether or not I've ever been abused and also that I restate all of Chris's criminal history,"" Ms. Moore said. Because of the coronavirus, she felt it was urgent to speed the process. Should they fall ill, they would have no rights in regard to the other without being married. ""Incarcerated people are 550 percent more likely to get Covid-19 and 300 percent more likely to die of it,"" she said. On May 18, Ms. Moore reached out to the D.O.C., including Robert Herzog, the assistant secretary of the Washington State Department of Corrections Prisons Division, and the associate superintendent of the Monroe complex, John Padilla, to inquire about getting married. They were denied at every turn. Emails were exchanged until mid-June. Her knowledge of the law and the system was invaluable during what she called a stressful process. Ms. Moore soon learned that the Washington Supreme Court had already proclaimed video marriages were legal on May 29 but had not issued a public statement about it.

Finally, on Aug. 18, after more calls and emails, Mr. Herzog, who had been contacted by State Senator Joe Nguyen at Ms. Moore's request, responded to Ms. Moore. He told her that the prison would allow a virtual ceremony. The next day, much to her surprise, she was notified that the ceremony could be done in person after all. The couple received a document that laid out the rules for the in-person ceremony including, ""There will be no physical contact at any time between any parties, to include the bride and groom. Failure to follow this expectation will result in immediate termination of the marriage ceremony, an infraction for the incarcerated individual, and suspension/termination of the visitor's visiting privileges."" On the day of their wedding, Mr. Blackwell was taken to the visitation room, wearing his assigned prison uniform and a mask that he had beaded himself with the letters BLM. (Mr. Blackwell is a bead artist, and sold some of the works he has made while in prison to buy Ms. Moore's engagement ring. ""Chris worked hard to sell his beadwork and make enough money to buy me a ring, a yellow diamond ring that has two crescent moons and one full moon in it,"" she said.) Ms. Moore's arrival to her wedding was delayed 40 minutes because of the prison's entry process, which she described as humiliating. Ms. Moore wore a long, sheer, white dress that had a knee-length slip beneath it. After prison officials measured the hem length, and then the height of her heels, she was then told the dress showed too much cleavage. ""So I had to zip up my jacket,"" she said. ""These are just some of the small indignities that someone who visits an incarcerated person has to suffer."" When she did finally walk in the room, the bride and groom had tears in their eyes.

""We were in constant fear of retribution,"" Mr. Blackwell said, ""of me being put in the hole, of the ceremony being stopped, of Chelsea losing her visitation rights."" Ms. Donovan, who served as the one witness Ms. Moore was allowed to have in attendance, said the ceremony ""was surreal."" She stood more than six feet away from the couple as the bride read her vows. ""I know our life together will not be easy, but loving you is,"" Ms. Moore said through her mask. ""And I promise to love you without regards to convenience or circumstance. This marriage is not the first mountain we have had to move to be together and it will not be the last."" Both said the ceremony, led by a prison chaplain, Brian Henry, passed in what felt like an instant. ""We signed the papers, took a few photos, and then we were told the ceremony was over,"" Mr. Blackwell said. ""It makes me tear up now because I have no idea when we'll see each other again."" Mr. Blackwell's mother said the years her son has spent behind bars have changed him.

Mr. Herzog of the D.O.C. said he was appreciative of the couple for working within the system. ""We are grateful to Ms. Moore and Mr. Blackwell for helping us work through the challenges to find a safe way to facilitate their marriage and we thank them for helping us define clear protocols to ensure all involved would be safe and secure,"" he said via email. ""We wish them a long and happy marriage."" The couple are in the early stages of forming a nonprofit group, Look2Justice, which will work for comprehensive sentencing reform in Washington, especially for people who committed crimes as young adults. ""We have a clear passion for the same things,"" Mr. Blackwell said by phone. ""We care about people. We care about equality."" In an email, Ms. Moore cites current brain science, which, she said, ""tells us that an individual's brain is not fully developed until around their 25th birthday. In Washington, people can't even buy tobacco until they're 21, yet in sentencing we treat anyone above the age of 18 the same. This legislation would provide people who received long sentences before the age of 25 to eventually be considered for parole."" Mr. Blackwell has said that he believes his juvenile convictions prejudiced his sentencing. Ms. Moore spoke to her family after the ceremony. ""They're not excited, but they're supportive, which is what I expected,"" she said. ""I'm so happy. I love him so immensely. I can't picture a life without him and I don't want to. Any life can turn difficult at any moment. I just followed my heart on this one.""","Chelsea Moore, a law student, married Christopher Blackwell, who is incarcerated, at the Monroe Correctional Complex in Washington State.

Education,The Critter People,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/education/edlife/edl-24naturalhistory-t.html,"Beyond the noisy throngs marveling at the dinosaurs, the dioramas and the immense blue whale, up on the fifth floor where visitors are not allowed, the American Museum of Natural History takes on an entirely different character. The neatly labeled metal lockers that line the hallway are much like the stacks of a research library, except that instead of books there are many of the museum's millions of specimens, from ants in amber to dry-mounted birds. Signs point the way to invertebrates, entomology, ornithology. Here, it is the quiet home of the Richard Gilder Graduate School, whose 13 students are earning doctorates in the specialized field of comparative biology, teasing out what fossils from the Gobi Desert and leeches and frogs have to reveal about the evolutionary tree of life. The museum is the first in the nation accredited to offer a doctorate in its own name. But around the country, all kinds of museums are venturing deeper into the world of education, finding new ways to use their collections in research and teacher training, and bringing in more students, in person and virtually. Many have entered into partnerships with local universities. Last year, Chicago's Museum of Science and Industry introduced a master's in science education with the Illinois Institute of Technology. The Getty Conservation Institute is in partnership with the University of California, Los Angeles, in a master's in conservation of ethnographic and archeological materials. The Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York joins with Parsons, the New School for Design, in a master's in the history of decorative arts and design. And it may not be long before others try to follow the Natural History Museum's lead in offering their own degree. ""We've had inquiries from quite a few other museums, and they're watching what we're doing with interest,"" says John Flynn, the paleontologist who is dean of the Gilder Graduate School, in its third year and accredited since 2009. ""Many museums already have a lot of what you need -- the collections, the curators, the libraries, the tradition of research.""

""There's been a redefinition of the schoolhouse, as the roles of different institutions are being blurred,"" says Ellen V. Futter, the president of the museum. All told, about 100 graduate students, including visiting students from the museum's longtime partner universities and postdoctoral fellows, roam the fifth floor. Gilder itself accepts only four or five students a year, an eclectic group of American and international scholars, some straight from college, some with master's degrees and years of work experience as a veterinary technician or a high school biology teacher. On a sunny morning this spring, the four first-years -- and two visiting students from other New York grad schools -- gathered for their ""Evolution"" seminar in a cozy classroom that reflects the museum's Victorian character. It has a fireplace, bay window with window seats, and huge mounted caribou head with elaborately arching antlers. ""Evolution"" is one of only three required classes. (The others are ""Grantsmanship, Ethics and Communications,"" in which students write grant proposals -- and sometimes get money -- and ""Systematics and Biogeography,"" which deals with the relationships among species and organization of life, past and present.)

For an hour and a half, Jin Meng, a paleontology curator who team-teaches the class, talked about the morphological differences between New World and Old World monkeys, the history of the research and fossil finds, and how delicately Darwin had to approach the new concept of human evolution. In many ways, it could have been a graduate seminar at any research university. But the Natural History Museum's program has some real differences. It is four years instead of the usual five. And most students go on extended field trips around the globe.

For Shaena Montanari, a third-year paleontology student interested in chemically analyzing dinosaur fossils to learn what they ate, the Gobi Desert has been a trove of specimens. ""The Gobi is very fossiliferous,"" she says. ""That's a word, right? Anyway, there's a lot of fossils there, very well preserved. You can even find a dinosaur brooding on a nest of eggs."" The quest to map and fill in the evolutionary tree of life is both the hallmark of the museum's scientific program and the focus of most of the students' research. How are frogs that burrow related to frogs that climb trees? How have leeches adapted to survive exclusively on blood? Dawn Roje, a first-year student researching flatfish, says that having that common interest is one of the pleasures of the program. ""I've done the university thing, and in a big biology department my interests wouldn't be in the mainstream,"" says Ms. Roje, who is going to Madagascar in the fall to gather tissue samples. ""Here we all share an interest in phylogenetics. We're all into that tree-of-life thing. I like being one of the white sheep, not the black sheep in the group."" Elective courses change from year to year, depending on students' interest. This year's offerings include a field course in Mexico on parasitology and another on major events in vertebrate evolution. And because many will move on to academia, students are required to complete two teaching stints, one as a teaching assistant in a university course and another that can be in a less formal setting, like one of the museum's education programs.

For his informal teaching, Mr. Kvist worked with a student in the museum's undergraduate research program, a 10-week summer internship. He taught her DNA extraction and sequencing, and she was listed as an author on an article, ""Teaching Biodiversity and Evolutionary Biology,"" published this year in The American Biology Teacher. ""The saying 'see one, do one, teach one' really became evident to me,"" Mr. Kvist says. ""It's true that you never fully understand something unless you've taught it to someone else."" Given the size of the program, with 50 or more applicants a year, it is an achievement just to be admitted. The doctoral students get full support -- tuition, a stipend and at least $2,000 of unrestricted research money, which can be supplemented by grants or further support from the school. Mr. Gilder, the brokerage founder who is the museum's largest donor, provided a $50 million endowment for the school. The students get to work closely with the curators -- the museum's tenured scientists, the equivalent of full professors at a university. And they have access to the specimens gathered over the 142 years of the museum's history, shelves crammed with wet samples and jars of iguanas, floor space taken up with large tanks for alligator and komodo dragon specimens. There are endless halls of insect specimens, and rooms where fossils are carefully brushed out of the sand they were buried in. There are state-of-the-art molecular labs and an imaging lab in which students can take CT scans of a rotating specimen and magnify them -- the better to count how many scales a lizard has on its legs. Several of the graduate students say they have always been critter people -- as interested in ants and bees and leeches as in more cuddly mammals. Phil Barden, a first-year student who studies fossil ants in amber, confessed wistfully that he sometimes misses live ants and watching the way they move. ""I'm going to set up a live colony in my office,"" he says. ""I just have to go out and collect a few queens.""","Dinosaur eggs, iguanas and ooh, look, a grad student.

Books,The Legacy of Slavery in Two Novels of the American South,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/books/review/deshawn-charles-winslow-west-mills-chanelle-benz-gone-dead.html,"De'Shawn Charles Winslow's ""In West Mills"" and Chanelle Benz's ""The Gone Dead"" both ponder secrets: what drives some people to guard them with their lives and others to risk everything to uncover them.

""In West Mills"" explores the textured inner world of a fictionalized black community in North Carolina between 1941 and 1987. The story circles around Azalea Centre, or Knot, a teacher who finds comfort in corn liquor, men, and friends like Otis Lee and Valley, who care for her even as her decisions beget pain.

From the first page, Winslow establishes an uncanny authority and profound tone that belie the book's debut status. The precision and charm of his language lure us in and soothe us, as in his description of a ""hot biscuit that looked like it could be melted down and used to make a necklace and a pair of matching ear bobs."" Or when he compares the full moon above Knot's head as she walks a lover home to ""an usher leading the way down an aisle.""

He paints a community so tightknit and thorough it becomes easy to forget the people in it don't exist, that no one will be playing music later tonight at Miss Goldie's barnhouse juke joint, or traveling upbridge to Manning's General Store for candy. Knot is as complex and endearing a protagonist as Zora Neale Hurston's Janie. And Winslow is capable of retreating into the quiet of all of his characters' minds and hearts and sharing the contents with us, as when Knot decides to create for herself a sense of safety, ""the only kind of safe Knot felt all right with. Safe by not having to worry about hurting a child's feelings, the way her mother had hurt hers. Safe by not becoming someone's wife just to figure out, years later, that she didn't want him.

Automobiles,The Extra-Spicy Sauce Is Back on Audi's Table,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/20/automobiles/autoreviews/tt-rs-extra-spicy-sauce-is-back-on-audis-table.html,"THE TT RS is a significant addition to the 2012 Audi line, and not just because this juiced-up little sports coupe is seductively quick and agile. The car also marks the return, after a short hiatus, of the RS badge that signifies ultrahigh performance. It also signals Audi's intention to finally get serious, after years of off-again, on-again production of RS models, about competing against the likes of BMW's M performance line and Mercedes-Benz's AMG division. Many automakers have special departments or subsidiaries that produce very powerful ""halo"" versions of their most sporty models. Audi's equivalent unit, called quattro, has generally taken a more conservative route with its RS enhancements, eschewing the sportiest cars while hot-rodding relatively mundane sedans and station wagons. Despite steep prices for these wolves in sheep's clothing, Audi says the RS models always sell well. Audi says about 56,000 RS models have been sold worldwide since 1994.

But the TT RS is what quattro calls ""our first thoroughbred sports car."" For now, it's a model lineup of one, but a veritable stampede of RS thoroughbreds will be coming. The company has set a goal of a ""100 percent increase in sales by 2015. New top models. New projects. New technologies."" While the A5 coupe and convertible might seem leading candidates for an RS makeover, Audi has declined to say which models will get the treatment. An RS transformation principally takes place in the engine compartment, although the chassis, suspension, wheels, tires, brakes and aerodynamics also receive a tweak or two. For the TT's RS makeover, the 2-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder motor has been replaced by a racing-derived 2.5-liter in-line 5, also turbocharged. Horsepower output -- just 211 in the base model, 265 in the S version -- is increased mightily to 360. Peak torque, which is 258 pound-feet in the base model, jumps to 343. Zero to 60 m.p.h. acceleration times contract to 4.1 seconds, Audi says, from 5.3 seconds. Despite the power surge, mileage is still respectable enough -- 18 city, 25 highway -- for the TT RS to serve as an everyday driver.

The all-wheel-drive setup includes the latest version of the Haldex multiplate-clutch torque-distributing system, which gives the TT RS the feel of a rear-drive car until there is need for more grip. The system is said to be proactive rather than reactive: it anticipates wheel slippage and reapportions torque to the wheels that need it most, even before traction is lost. During a day of Audi-sponsored testing on a racetrack here, the TT RS resisted attempts to unsettle it. Even driven sloppily -- a personal specialty -- the all-wheel-drive system seemed to sense which wheel would need maximum torque to keep the car from losing traction. Getting the tail to step out at all was a challenge. At the ragged edge of control, there was only the slightest sign of understeer; it was more of a four-wheel drift. The magnetic ride system uses ride-leveling magneto-rheological shocks to keep the car's angle of attack dead flat, even when it is pitched violently -- another specialty of the writer -- into the sharpest turns. The system includes a Sport setting that enlivens throttle response in track-day competition and opens the exhaust for lower back-pressure, greater horsepower and more of a grumpy, growly sound. From 60 m.p.h., huge 14.6-inch front brake discs help to yank the TT RS to a stop in a jolting 114 feet. There was little evidence of brake fade, and scant change in the feel of the pedal, even after the car was thrashed around on black asphalt for several hours in 104-degree heat. The performance modifications add about 150 pounds over the base TT. But the unloaded weight of 3,306 pounds makes the TT RS feel substantial rather than sloppy. Because the four-wheel independent suspension has been retuned, the car rides slightly lower than other TTs. Other visual differences include a rear diffuser, a blacked-out grille, alloy wheels and other small modifications. Inside, the most notable difference is a pair of really well-bolstered sport seats. The performance steering wheel has additional functionality, like a lap timer.

After the transcendent performance of the RS, returning to the merely mortal TT, or even the somewhat rowdier TT S, is a bit of a letdown. The throttle response of the TT S can seem almost indifferent to the driver's prompting, compared with the eagerly responsive TT RS. The RS performance enhancements come with a $10,000 markup over the TT S (which at $47,875 is about $9,000 more than the base TT). Mark Dahncke, an Audi spokesman, said the primary competitors were the highest-performing versions of the BMW Z4, Mercedes-Benz SLK and the Porsche Cayman R. Against those comparisons, the TT RS comes out as not only a more powerful choice, but also, at $57,725, a more cost-effective one. The BMW and Benz, however, offer a retractable hardtop. But the TT RS is making itself scarce. Audi says only 1,000 are being produced each model year and only 200 of those -- all coupes -- are allotted to the United States. The initial allotment is spoken for, the company says, and perhaps that level of buyer interest will persuade the company to make the roadster more widely available.","The juiced-up TT RS is a significant addition to the 2012 Audi line because it marks the return of the RS badge, the brand's ultrahigh performance line.",c50b4f57-064f-57ed-a54c-45f43f4e08d2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/11/20/automobiles/20AUDI2/20AUDI2-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=300&w=600&s=1948f447bf15865d0472d0ad0ed88294916f4787fb6e5a03b4dea6009dd694d3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,RELABELED A 2012 version of the TT wears the high-performance RS badge.,c50b4f57-064f-57ed-a54c-45f43f4e08d2,N24News/imgs/c50b4f57-064f-57ed-a54c-45f43f4e08d2.jpg,23
Television,Trevor Noah Says Trump Should Embrace 'Fire and Fury' Book,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/arts/television/trevor-noah-trump-fire-fury-.html,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown that lets you sleep -- and lets us get paid to watch comedy. What do you think of it? What else are you interested in? Let us know: thearts@nytimes.com. Why Collude, if You Don't Want to Win? Late-night hosts on Thursday pored over the bombshell accounts of the Trump administration's first year contained in ""Fire and Fury,"" a forthcoming book by the journalist Michael Wolff. A major assertion is that President Trump was disappointed when he won the 2016 election. Trevor Noah said Mr. Trump might actually want to embrace that narrative. ""I will say this: If you believe that he didn't want to win, then it's hard to believe that he colluded with the Russians, right? If anything, instead of trying to shut this book down, Trump should be sending a copy to Robert Mueller to be like, 'You see? It exonerates me!' 'The part where it says you're an idiot?' 'No, no, go on further!'"" -- TREVOR NOAH

Stephen Colbert pointed out that Steve Bannon, the president's former chief strategist, is in hot water with allies after being shown roundly criticizing Mr. Trump in the book. ""Bannon has caught holy hell from his own supporters. In the last 24 hours alone, candidates he has endorsed have abandoned him; he lost his biggest billionaire donor; even the alt-right is turning its back on Steve Bannon. It's true, they're so embarrassed of Bannon that a lot of the alt-right have started covering their faces with hoods!"" -- STEPHEN COLBERT

The Trump administration on Thursday authorized prosecutors to go after marijuana offenders even in states where consumption of the drug is legal. Mr. Colbert said the decision revealed something about Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who spearheaded the move. ""This new directive from Sessions can mean only one thing: He still doesn't know that white people smoke pot, too. 'We can't expose our delicate young ladies to the jazzman's reefer stick. I said good day, sir! Beauregard, bring the horses around!' I'm paraphrasing, obviously."" -- STEPHEN COLBERT Senator Bernie Sanders criticized Mr. Sessions, but even he came in for some ridicule. ""Sanders was critical of treating pot smokers as criminals, saying: Marijuana isn't heroin. It's true, marijuana is not heroin. And for the record, Senator Sanders, a spoon is not a comb."" -- STEPHEN COLBERT ""There is a whopper of a storm hitting the East Coast right now. There hasn't been such an aggressive onslaught of white since Trump took office."" -- STEPHEN COLBERT ""Like all massive snowstorms, the Weather Channel has given this one a name. They're calling it Winter Storm Grayson -- making it the first storm named after a child throwing a tantrum in line at Whole Foods."" -- STEPHEN COLBERT Desus and Mero think Mr. Bannon is right about one thing: Donald Trump Jr. would ""crack like an egg"" under a congressional inquiry.","Mr. Noah said that President Trump ought to welcome reports that he didn't really want to be president.

Technology,Uber's Self-Driving Cars Are Valued at $7.25 Billion by Investors,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/technology/uber-atg-autonomous-cars-investment.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Uber's autonomous vehicle unit is receiving a new investment, the company said late Thursday, just days before it begins pitching its business to public investors.

SoftBank, Toyota and the Japanese automaker Denso will put $1 billion toward Uber's effort to develop autonomous cars. As Uber marches toward an I.P.O., the deal will help shield the company from tough questions about how the money-losing endeavor is harming its profit prospects.

The self-driving unit, known as the Autonomous Technology Group, or A.T.G., will be restructured as part of the deal, allowing for a targeted investment rather than a broad investment in Uber, a ride-hailing giant with a number of smaller businesses. The self-driving group will answer to its own corporate board, made up of representatives from Uber, SoftBank and Toyota, with Uber maintaining majority control.

The deal values this unit at $7.25 billion, the company said. Toyota and Denso's investment totals $667 million, while SoftBank's is $333 million.",A billion-dollar investment is meant to prop up a money-losing unit before Uber makes its pitches ahead of a planned I.P.O.,b40ee9b1-78af-5162-9322-2a3c33ef9b8c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/18/world/18uber/merlin_151606002_0842f07e-49a3-4823-9600-fb0740880958-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=db4230efe3288650b9fa0da30d44ac04cf19c996723fbe73bc7ab9b24e875f9e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"An autonomous Volvo being developed by Uber.

Style,"Your New Home: Ready to See Now, via Virtual Reality",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/style/virtual-reality-interior-design.html,"Interior design projects that don't go well, or don't happen at all, tend to have one thing in common: a failure of vision. You may fail to envision what you want, and do nothing. Or your vision, when completed, fails to match your fantasy. You live surrounded by your regret or spend even more to fix it. But increasingly, technology offers ways to better visualize, say, how a costly couch would look in your living room or how a proposed kitchen renovation would come together. Virtual reality, augmented reality and 3D renderings are the latest tools designers and retailers are using to give clients a clearer vision of projects and purchases before they commit. ""A lot of design is trying to explain yourself,"" said Kevin Hecker of Sea Cliff, N.Y., a software engineer who needed help furnishing the living room of the Victorian-style house he shares with his wife and three children. ""You have a feeling of what you want, but it's hard to articulate. You just know it when you see it."" That's why last fall he chose Decorilla, an online interior design service that offers virtual reality depictions of room redesigns. After sending photographs and dimensions of his living room and discussing his style preferences with a Decorilla designer, Mr. Hecker inserted his smartphone into virtual reality goggles he received in the mail to view the designer's proposal.

""It really looked like our living room,"" Mr. Hecker said. ""It's wild. With virtual reality, you can see how multiple pieces go together and from different views, as if you're walking around."" He liked what he saw so much, he ended up buying everything (aside from the fur-covered ottoman, because he and his wife were morally opposed) and arranging it just as the designer had suggested. Most of the items came from familiar retailers like West Elm and Crate & Barrel. Mr. Hecker said the discounts he received by buying through Decorilla more than paid for the $445 design fee.

Decorilla's prices range from $400 to $1,300, depending on the size of the room and the designer's experience. Alternatively, the online interior design service Havenly charges a flat $199 per room, which includes emailed 3D visualizations of proposed designs. Three-dimensional plans are not as immersive or as cool as virtual reality, but they do give you a pretty good sense of what your space would look like. Havenly's renderings are created from photographs of your room overlaid with suggested furnishings, paint color, window treatments, accessories and other additions. Everything is to scale, giving you a sense of depth and proportion.

""We do a lot of testing around here and tried providing the service without the visualization piece,"" said Lee Mayer, a co-founder and the chief executive of Havenly. ""But when you get a rendering of your space, it creates a 15 to 20 percent lift in your likelihood to purchase through us the furnishings our designer suggested."" It's not surprising, then, that some retailers have started developing visualization apps to help customers be more comfortable buying furnishings online. Because of the expense and level of difficulty, only a few are experimenting with virtual reality. Examples include the Swedish furniture maker Ikea and Doing It Right This Time, or DIRTT, a Canadian company that builds prefab office and residential interiors, including cabinetry, bookshelves and partitions. Others, like FabIndia, an Indian home and lifestyle brand, are testing augmented reality, often described as ""virtual reality lite,"" because rather than wearing special goggles, you hold your phone or tablet as if you were about to take a picture of your room and then dynamically bring into view objects such as sofas, tables and chairs from retail catalogs. ""Our products are a significant investment, so we want people to know what to expect before it's shipped and delivered,"" said Calvin Haggard, the chief executive of United States Stove Company, explaining why the nearly 150-year-old manufacturing business began offering an augmented reality app. ""The items shown on the app are to scale, so you're not guessing if things will fit. And you can try out enameled or cast iron and various colors, so you can see what matches your decor."" There are also free D.I.Y. interior design apps that use augmented reality, including Adornably, Homestyler, Virtual Interior Home Decoration Tool and iStaging. But they are more difficult to use, and offer only a limited (and not that appealing) selection of items.

Although virtual reality, augmented reality and 3D renderings have varying degrees of verisimilitude, many design experts and homeowners agree that they are better than leaving things to the imagination, and they are much easier to decipher than a blueprint. ""It's definitely the wave of the future, because it allows the general population to make design decisions without feeling hesitant or insecure,"" said Khoi Vo, a professor and the chair of the department of interior design at Savannah College of Art and Design. ""These programs allow us to not only show, 'Here's what a design will look like,' but 'Here's what it will look like at night during a full moon and here's what it will look like during the day.'"" But, he said, the expense and expertise required to create virtual reality renderings that are lifelike rather than cartoonish remain high hurdles. For some, a 3D rendering may be just as good.

Kathryn Schmahl, a health care marketing consultant in River Forest, Ill., found 3D renderings from Havenly more than adequate for redesigning the circa 1879 wood-plank farmhouse she shares with her husband and two young sons. And they were much more helpful, she said, than the collages of proposed items provided by an interior designer with whom she had worked and had paid nearly $10,000. ""It was amazing to me that I could send pictures and describe what I wanted and get emailed to me my room redesigned exactly how it would look -- even down to what's behind the windows, like I'd see a tree if there was a tree,"" said Ms. Schmahl, who over the last year has used Havenly to redo almost every room in her house.",New interior design tools help clients visualize how their redecorated homes will look.,1868c44c-df49-594b-9b2c-3937694a3e9c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/12/fashion/12HOMEVIRTUAL-WEB4/12HOMEVIRTUAL-WEB4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=a207227617e550f867010c801c348794dabad610435ef03bb7aba2182c9b1f9c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Marsha Keskinen, center left, of Time Warner with Drew Groeger of DIRTT, tour and modify an office design inside the ICE 3d software using virtual reality.",1868c44c-df49-594b-9b2c-3937694a3e9c,N24News/imgs/1868c44c-df49-594b-9b2c-3937694a3e9c.jpg,15

We're all stuck at home at the moment, so here are the 50 best movies on Netflix right now.

Some have suggested holding it outdoors; if that happens, Trump's got a name picked out, Jimmy Fallon said on Tuesday: ""He's going to call it 'Covid-chella.'""

In an editorial yesterday, Tulsa's largest newspaper, The Tulsa World, opined, 'This is the wrong time and Tulsa is the wrong place for the Trump rally.' But you know what they say, two wrongs make a rally full of whites."" -- STEPHEN COLBERT

""The paper explained, 'The city and state have authorized reopening, but that doesn't make a mass indoor gathering of people pressed closely together and cheering a good idea.' Yes, it's not. Otherwise, I would still be doing it in the Ed Sullivan Theater. I have forgotten what laughter sounds like, and it is killing me -- but not as fast as having an audience would kill them. That's why I'm sitting in my study, shouting jokes into the draperies."" -- STEPHEN COLBERT

""This is an interesting sign of the times, a small show of progress, perhaps. Johnson and Johnson announced via Instagram their plan to help heal our nation's wounds, a line of racially inclusive Band-Aids. The Johnsons wrote: 'We hear you. We see you. We're listening to you.  We stand in solidarity with our Black colleagues, collaborators and community in the fight against racism, violence and injustice.' They are literally putting a Band-Aid on the problem of racism."" -- JIMMY KIMMEL ""Now, don't get me wrong: I think it's long overdue for racial minorities to have products that recognize their existence.

Style,"From Plagues to Floods to Black Tuesday, Fashion Goes On",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/style/louis-vuitton-chanel-alexander-mcqueen-paris-fashion-week.html,"The shows ended with a clash of the centuries at Louis Vuitton, heroics at Alexander McQueen and -- hot pants at Chanel?

The last show of the season was held at the shuttered Louvre, which has been closed to tourists and art lovers alike because of staff fears over the virus, but not, apparently, to Louis Vuitton (at least not its courtyards). In trooped the bedraggled fashion folk as always, but the mood was not the same as always. They went past the sunset-dusted pyramid, sure, but also past the groups of police in black riot gear with articulated leather armor and plastic shields, past the dozen police vans idling nearby. Instead of the usual giddy relief because the fashion circus was almost over, there was a barely restrained desire to flee. Get me out of here! Now we can get back to -- self quarantine.

But, ""you can't run away from things,"" Sarah Burton said backstage a day earlier at Alexander McQueen, just before a show she called ""a love letter to other women, my team, our children,"" rooted in the history of Wales: its red houses, poetry, quilts, landscapes, ""togetherness."" ""You have to be present,"" Ms. Burton said. ""We have to be bold,"" even when we are feeling fragile. Or at least dress as if we are. Ms. Burton's tailoring -- in gray and black lines meant to mimic a blown-up quilting pattern that slashed across the body in graphic detail, often with a swallowtail hem at the back -- is all that. So are her draped blanket dresses in leather and wool, worn over one shoulder; and her intricately beaded dresses worn over slick leather leggings and falling somewhere between spider web and chain mail, plus a little more: look closer and there were hearts embedded in the embroidery. That's what fashion can give you: a way to be in the world. A way to move through the day however unsettlingly that day evolves because -- well, it's got you covered.

Pun intended. A little humor is no bad thing at the moment. Witness Glenn Martens of Y/Project, who is a dab hand at twisting the basics of everyday to continually challenge what is revealed, what is concealed, and what makes you blink and look again. Like jeans and other trousers cut into a deep V at the front so they seemed perennially unzipped, worn over a variety of bodysuits, like some form of perverse chaps. Now you see it -- what exactly do you see?

A way to suggest we've all come undone, perhaps. And that despite it all, you don't actually have to worry that your pants will fall down. There's an internal waistband. In the end, we figure it out. Hopefully. Mostly. Chitose Abe at Sacai usually does, setting herself a puzzle every season -- how to combine disparate and oppositional elements into an elevated whole -- and then solving it. This time it was Chesterfields and tuxedos (masculine cliches) and lingerie (feminine ones), and the result, which could easily have been lumpy, was instead elegantly liberated.

At Miu Miu, Miuccia Prada may have eschewed her usual post-show press meet-and-greet-and-kiss-and-ruminate but her runway ruminated for her in a highly idiosyncratic game of silver screen dress-up: crushed silk sheaths in circus brights, taffeta poufs, 1940s suiting with skirts slit to the thigh; sheer slips dripping crystal drops. As she said via email, clothes ""not only impress on others, but help reframe a perception of the wearer in their own mind."" And at Chanel, Virginie Viard continued her ever-so-gentle lightening up of the Karl Lagerfeld legacy. Her main innovation thus far has been pockets (that's not sarcasm; pockets are great) but this time she also forewent the elaborate sets Mr. Lagerfeld made famous in favor of a mirrored floor and a few halfhearted smoke machines, across which her models ambled, sometimes in pairs, sometimes in threes, chatting away, as if they had forgotten they were on a runway.

It was charming, in a voyeuristic way, but the stripped-down set also had the side effect of focusing attention on the clothes, which were -- not. There was the usual boucle, mostly in knee-length skirt suits and coats in citrine and watermelon. There were some little black dresses with the requisite white lace collar and cuffs. There was a nod to Mr. Lagerfeld's love of a Belle Epoque frock: a strapless taffeta number with detached puffed sleeves. Every look came paired with fairy-tale ""seven league boots,"" as Ms. Viard called them in her show notes, which were cool. But there were also hot pants over sheer logo tights and cropped white cotton dickeys. Blouson gray boucle high-waist sweats and a matching bandeau top. A ruffled wrestling pinafore over a white lace tee. And lots and lots of jodhpurs that looked more like very wide track pants with snaps -- brass, diamante -- up the side, most of which had been popped open so the pant legs flapped awkwardly around the calves and knees. Mr. Lagerfeld often had similar clunkers in his shows, but they were obscured by the supermarkets and airplanes that surrounded them. Ms. Viard left hers front and center. That's both brave and foolhardy.

Perhaps she was nostalgic for earlier days when the next gen (because these could only have been directed at the youth vote) could mosey along the streets in their Chanel without running into a protest and fearing they would be Marie Antoinette'd in their double Cs (the former French queen is the muse of the season). But while there's nothing wrong with a little yen for ye olden days -- fashion was built on it -- you can't ignore the reality of right now. After all, the past is how we got to here: this weird, confused, end-of-days moment. That was the point of Nicolas Ghesquiere's Vuitton show, which began in the gloom of a black box stuck in that deserted Louvre courtyard.

Style,"Gossip From the Liz Smith Memorial, Just the Way She'd Want It",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/style/liz-smith-memorial.html,"Gossip From the Liz Smith Memorial, Just the Way She'd Want It

""I am a garbage pail,"" the gossip columnist Liz Smith once said. ""My best stories come from other newspaper people and media people. My best stories come from people at The New York Times and CBS and NBC and ABC and Time and Newsweek. People who are frustrated by what they know and don't have a place to print."" Her favorite foods were fried, her favorite exercise was none, and when she dined at restaurants -- which was pretty much all the time -- she left inordinately large tips, saying, ""no one ever got rich stiffing a waiter."" Although she never won a Pulitzer Prize, Mike Wallace once said she was more widely read (and better paid) than almost anyone who did. She trafficked in gossip, but knew ""The Odyssey"" backward and forward. And, somewhat counterintuitively, she regarded benevolence as an essential requirement of her job.

The crowd included people from virtually every sector of media and entertainment. Toward the front on the left was Gay Talese. Just behind was the film producer Jean Doumanian. A ways over was Tom Wolfe. Cynthia McFadden, a correspondent at NBC, was the first speaker and said that Ms. Smith had at first been against having a memorial. ""But with a little loving encouragement, she seemed to soften,"" Ms. McFadden said. So much so, in fact, that by the time she died, there was an exit note left in her sofa with detailed instructions to friends that included the request (""in all caps,"" Ms. McFadden noted) that they hold this posthumous event at a Shubert Theater. Barry Diller spoke after Ms. McFadden and talked about how he shared a birthday with Ms. Smith and Elaine Stritch.

One year, Mr. Diller, Ms. Stritch and Ms. Smith decided to celebrate at the 21 Club. That excursion came to an end after the third oyster, when Ms. Stritch said, ""this place is a dump,"" grabbed everyone's coats and took them to 3 Guys. In the late 1980s, Mr. Diller worked as an executive at Fox, where one of his responsibilities was starting what he described as an ""'Entertainment Tonight""-type show. ""Liz introduced me to a producer she had known and who I had never met before,"" Mr. Diller said. ""He'd come from political campaigning, and I thought he'd be great. He was, but not for this show. We became friends, and later I introduced him to Rupert Murdoch. His name was Roger Ailes. So, Liz, it's all your fault."" Other speakers included the actors Renee Zellweger (who described Ms. Smith traveling to Austin, Tex., in 2011, despite a hip injury, so she could accompany her to a film festival), Bruce Willis (who recalled Ms. Smith's habit of using her column for charitable causes) and Holland Taylor (who met Ms. Smith back in the mid-'70s and received her last email from Ms. Smith around Nov. 5, a week before her death).

Had Ms. Taylor and Ms. Smith enjoyed a summer romance back at the beginning of their relationship? Ms. Taylor alluded to that possibility from the stage, but said that what really endured between them was a friendship that ""was for me the single safe harbor in what has always seemed a storm-tossed scattered life in, let's not kid ourselves, the mean old world."" The writer Billy Norwich said he owed his name to Ms. Smith. She had been a mentor to him when he was young, broke and looking to break into the publishing business. ""'Honey,'"" he recalled her telling him, ""'the first thing we need to do is get you a better name if you're going to be a writer.' I was born Billy Goldberg in Norwich, Conn., and one day over lunch I became Billy Norwich from Goldberg, Conn. Which is very useful because you get the anti-Semitism direct that way."" Over the years, Ms. Smith promoted Mr. Norwich relentlessly to colleagues. She also admonished him for misspelling people's names in his columns at The New York Observer and The New York Daily News, advised him to always have two drinks before he went reporting at society functions, and stepped in front of Oscar de la Renta the night he was about to knock Mr. Norwich out for something he'd written.

Long before President Trump began calling CNN ""fake news,"" Ms. Stahl said he vowed to purchase The Daily News merely so he could fire Ms. Smith, who had written disparagingly about him during his divorce from Ivana Trump. And Ms. Smith did have a few shortcomings. For example, Ms. McFadden said, ""she was not good at keeping a secret. Professional liability, I guess."" Yet she rarely lost friends. ""If she did, she would woo them and get them back,"" Ms. Stahl said. I can attest to both of these things being true. For many years, Ms. Smith was a close friend of my mother, Nora Ephron.

I'm sure Ms. Smith was devastated by the loss, but her claim that she thought my mother had died when she posted the piece made no sense. In the piece itself, she said my mother hadn't died. But I couldn't stay mad at her. She was too kind. She was too smart. She was too much fun. And it was precisely the sort of thing my mother would have found amusing, had it happened to anyone else. (I could almost see my mother saying: ""Well, what did you expect?"" A scary thing about storytellers is that their central allegiance is to the story.) So seven weeks later, I called Ms. Smith for help on an article and stayed friendly with her until her death. Bygones. The world was a better place with her in it.","Liz Smith was one of the most famous gossip columnists of the last 50 years.

Books,The Man Who Stole Bird Feathers,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/books/review/kirk-wallace-johnson-feather-thief.html,"THE FEATHER THIEF

Beauty, Obsession, and the Natural History Heist of the Century

By Kirk Wallace Johnson

Illustrated. 308 pp. Viking. $27.

In June 2009, , a 20-year-old American flutist studying at the Royal Academy of Music, smashed a window at the Museum of Natural History in Tring, near London, and pulled off one of the more bizarre robberies of recent decades. Under the nose of a hapless security guard, Rist ransacked storage drawers and absconded with the preserved skins of 299 tropical birds, including specimens collected by the legendary naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace in the mid-19th century. He intended to fence the birds' extravagantly colored plumage at high prices to fellow aficionados in hopes of raising enough cash to support both his musical career and his parents' struggling Labradoodle-breeding business in the Hudson Valley.

Kirk Wallace Johnson's ""The Feather Thief: Beauty, Obsession, and the Natural History Heist of the Century"" recounts Rist's odd crime and its even more curious aftermath. Johnson, a former U.S.A.I.D. employee in Falluja, Iraq, and the founder of the List Project (a nonprofit organization that resettles Iraqis marked for death after working with the American military), first heard about Rist's robbery during a trout-fishing holiday in New Mexico: ""I don't know if it was Edwin's Victorian sounding name, the sheer weirdness of the story or the fact that I was in desperate need of a new direction in life, but I became obsessed with the crime within moments."" So he set out to learn all he could about Rist, unspooling a complex tale of greed, deception and ornithological sabotage.

Rist's feather obsession turns out to have rich antecedents. Johnson describes Wallace's 1854 expedition through the Malaysian jungle in pursuit of the Bird of Paradise, which ""had an otherworldly beauty. ... From its tail emerged two wiry feathers that spiraled tightly into two glittering emerald coins."" Walter Rothschild, the eccentric scion of the banking family, eagerly took in the specimens from the expedition and assembled the largest private collection of bird skins in the world at his Tring mansion, which later became a branch of the Natural History Museum.","Kirk Wallace Johnson's ""The Feather Thief"" recounts ""the natural history heist of the century.""",7b9e84fc-a8e4-5fd4-9fce-90ac2799c487,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/03/books/review/03HAMMER/merlin_138486585_57c0532d-009a-4cac-998f-74cee60a3411-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=f574038ea0a0751585dbf2a8ab0ea1f75cc0a84a54356d2cc625cf4ee3a4f056&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Edwin Rist,7b9e84fc-a8e4-5fd4-9fce-90ac2799c487,N24News/imgs/7b9e84fc-a8e4-5fd4-9fce-90ac2799c487.jpg,13
Art & Design,"The Art of Caribbean Exchange, in Gold, Stone or Hardwood",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/arts/design/arte-del-mar-caribbean-art.html,"If you want to make sense of the Caribbean, you had better prepare for some island-hopping: This is a place where not just people but ideas and images are constantly on the move. That's the premise and the appeal of ""Arte del Mar: Art of the Caribbean,"" a concentrated showcase at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that plunges visitors into a sea of archipelagic thinking. It is the Met's first show to reckon with the Caribbean as its own zone of contact, and includes not only art from the West Indies -- specifically on the island of Hispaniola, now divided between Haiti and the Dominican Republic; Puerto Rico; Cuba and the Turks and Caicos -- but also from the Caribbean-facing coasts of mainland Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia. It's only the size of a single gallery, and almost everything here dates from before the colonial era, some of it centuries before, or from the first years after European contact. And yet ""Arte del Mar,"" if its Spanish-language title suggests the colonial violence to come, reveals that ideas and images were crossing the sea long before Christopher Columbus misunderstood ""Caribs"" as meaning ""cannibals."" By the time the first slave ships arrived, the Caribbean region was well-established as a zone of exchange and hybridity.

The Taino were organized into multiple polities, each governed by a leader known as a cacique, and each showcasing its wealth and strength through carved stones, wooden and woven furniture and luxuries obtained through trade with societies from Mexico to Venezuela. (Bartolome de las Casas, the Spanish colonist, reported in 1542 that among the Taino on Hispaniola there were ""five very large principal kingdoms and five very powerful kings, whom almost all the other lords, who were numerous, obeyed."") One portable wooden throne here, dating to the early 15th century and produced by a Taino artisan in what's now the Turks and Caicos, swoops as gently as a hammock (a word borrowed from the Taino ""hamaka""), while the seat features a zoomorphic figurehead with bared teeth. You'll also see finely hewed three-pointed stones, from the area that is present-day Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, that are carved with the faces of humans and animals. While they appear to have some connection to yuca and cassava production, they were probably meant for spiritual rather than practical use. Central to Taino metaphysics was ""zemi,"" a spiritual power that circulated from gods and ancestors into the natural environment: the sea, the forest, the stones. A Taino leader would have perceived the presence of a zemi in the tree that was carved into this show's most exquisite object: a ritual vessel in the form of a crouching, grimacing deity, standing a little over two feet tall and meant to hold a hallucinogenic powder known as cohoba. His ears have been elongated with plugs, while on his head he wears a woven skullcap of an intricate geometric design. Look closely and you'll see that the artist (or artists) who carved this zemi took care to groove its face with two wide, vertical ridges that extend down from his eyes to his chin. This god is crying his eyes out.

Historians estimate that people probably first settled the Antilles in the fifth millennium B.C.; archaeological evidence of these earliest arrivals is scarce, though the word ""canoe"" is also of Taino origin. Yet the ceramics and stone carvings found there affirm cultural and economic exchange between island societies and those on the Caribbean mainland. Check out the three extravagant gold pendants here, hammered at the start of the last millennium in what today is Panama: symmetrical, supernatural birds, their wings splayed out flat, their necks ringed with zigzagging necklaces. They would have had religious but also diplomatic uses, to judge by how far they traveled. Some of these Panamanian birds fluttered to the Antilles and as far as Guyana.

By the 16th century, after the Spanish brought their weapons and their diseases to the New World, the Taino had almost completely died out. Their ceremonies were supplanted by Christian worship, their zemi statues by crucifixes and saints. ""Arte del Mar"" might have been more illuminating if it were a bit larger, and extended past the pre-Columbian tradition to include the art of colonial settlers and of Afro-Caribbean populations. Yet Mr. Doyle has provided a sharp modern coda with the Cuban artist Wifredo Lam's ""Rumor de la Tierra"" (""Rumblings of the Earth""), a 1950 painting on loan from the Guggenheim that depicts angular, mostly headless humanoids dancing or charging through a sea of brown. The placement of the figures is explicitly indebted to Picasso's ""Guernica,"" but also draws on the forms of the Afro-Cuban religion known as Santeria -- and the prehistoric bird at the center bears a passing resemblance to the avian statuary elsewhere in this show. Alongside ""Rumor de la Tierra,"" you can read on the wall a few lines from the Martinican philosopher Edouard Glissant, who argued that Lam's art embodied a particularly Caribbean aesthetic. The painting allows African, indigenous, and European forms to jostle with and transform one another without losing their cultural specificity. It's encouraging to discover the voice of Glissant, perhaps the last century's most profound thinker on global culture and identity, in galleries that were not too long ago designated for ""primitive art."" Unlike the Mediterranean Sea, he proposed in his classic ""Poetics of Relation"" (1990), the Caribbean is ""a sea that explodes the scattered lands into an arc. A sea that diffracts."" It's not a melting pot, but a web of lived relations, where the Old World's absolute categories of race, language or religion mix and mingle. In that way, Glissant understood the Caribbean as a paradigm for a contemporary global citizenship, a way to understand identity in an era of constant motion. As the Met prepares a major renovation of its Rockefeller Wing, where some of this show's Taino artworks have been on view for a generation, the best thing its curators can do now is to learn from these Caribbean examples, and to map the objects in its collection as links in an infinite, nonhierarchial chain of human encounters. (Montreal's Museum of Fine Arts, incidentally, has recently rehung its collection in explicit tribute to Glissant, uniting all its departments into a single ""Arts of One World."")","""Arte del Mar,"" an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum, shows that the West Indies were a meeting point of cultures long before the European arrival.",9f7c1f7d-849a-50f5-aa48-a7208bc552d3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/23/arts/23artedelmar-review3/23artedelmar-review3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=514cfe55e4cb764aacbff9f3e675fc847d86dd0eec35707e2b75378d84cc3d53&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Gold figure pendant made by the Tairona people in north Colombia, 10th-16th century.",9f7c1f7d-849a-50f5-aa48-a7208bc552d3,N24News/imgs/9f7c1f7d-849a-50f5-aa48-a7208bc552d3.jpg,14

Television,'Game of Thrones' Is Ending. But You Can Still Visit Westeros.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/arts/television/game-of-thrones-locations.html,"'Game of Thrones' Is Ending. But You Can Still Visit Westeros.

CUSHENDUN, Northern Ireland -- The many marvels dotting the dramatic Antrim Coast of Northern Ireland include a cluster of eerily beautiful caves in this tidy village, around 45 miles north of Belfast. Formed by 400 million years of shifting red stone and the surging slate-blue Irish Sea, the caves inspire awed reflection upon the raw power of nature and the irresistible imprint of time, among other musings on the mystic. A voice whispered into my ear: ""That's where Melisandre gave birth to the shadow monster."" So it was -- I knew it was around there somewhere, as did the dozens of ""Game of Thrones"" fans surrounding me, feverishly snapping selfies before returning to their tour bus in a nearby parking lot. The voice belonged to my own guide, Flip Robinson, a 6-foot-8, magnificently bearded man who previously parlayed his stature into a gig as a stand-in for behemoth characters like Hodor and the Mountain. He waved to a colleague as she led her group away as suddenly as it had arrived, and off toward Braavos or the Iron Islands or some other ""Thrones"" location down the road.

Nowhere is that dynamic more visible and tangible than the production's former home, which, as the series kicks off its final season on HBO on April 14, is poised to serve as the keeper of the ""Thrones"" flame. ""Game of Thrones"" has filmed all over the globe, including in Croatia, Spain, Morocco, Iceland and Malta, and other locations have become synonymous with the show, for better and worse. But as the home of not only the production, in Belfast's Titanic Studios, but also Westeros itself, Northern Ireland has been transformed in fact and figment. As the series altered the TV landscape, it also altered actual landscapes: For millions of viewers all over the world, this country has been redefined and remade in the show's image.

In the process, Belfast's filmmaking industry has gone from a sleepy endeavor to a powerhouse. ""'Game of Thrones' changed everything,"" said Richard Williams, the chief executive of Northern Ireland Screen, which promotes film and television production in the country. ""We are relevant -- it is basically night and day."" The region has also built a tourism economy on the back of the show, especially on the coast, which provided much of the outdoor scenery. This majestic stretch of landscape and its famously scenic Causeway Coastal Route is now crisscrossed with motor coaches bearing ""Thrones"" pilgrims. Elsewhere, spots like the Castle Ward estate, near Strangford, site of the original Winterfell, have seen crowds swell with thousands of fans each year. All told, ""Thrones"" has funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into the region. But the financial benefit might actually pale compared with a more existential one in a place that for decades was known internationally mostly for sectarian violence. ""Twenty years ago, you would have been here writing about the Troubles, not a TV show,"" Gary Hawthorne, one of my drivers, told me during my visit. Robinson said, ""Fake violence has helped bring us back from the real violence.""

""We had 63 locations in 10 years, every single one of them within and hour and a half of Belfast,"" said Robert Boake, the supervising location manager in Northern Ireland. This became apparent on the afternoon I spent driving with Robinson along the causeway, a twisting roadway that hugs the U-shaped glens of the coa st, the Irish Sea on one side and villages and vertiginous green hillsides, strewn with sheep, on the other. In mere hours, we spanned Westeros and beyond, moving from the Wall and Castle Black (Magheramorne quarry), to the stairs where Arya crawled out of the Braavos canal (Carnlough Harbor) to the rocky shoreline in Pyke (Ballintoy) where the Greyjoys did nutty Greyjoy stuff. We also closed the shadow-baby loop, strolling around the Stormlands meadow (near Murlough Bay) where Renly made camp until Melisandre's monster got ahold of him. Occasionally we stopped to walk around and by turns get lashed with rain, pummeled by wind and caressed by crystalline sunshine. (""In Northern Ireland, you get four seasons in one day,"" Robinson told me, which I eventually came to realize is a national slogan.) At Fair Head outside Ballycastle, we parked in a muddy lot, dropped a few pounds in the honor box and walked uphill through a horizontal downpour. About 20 minutes later, the rain was gone and the sun dried our faces as gale-force gusts threatened to blow us over the edge of a sheer cliff dropping hundreds of feet to the rocky coast. We'd arrived at Dragonstone, or the dazzling headland the Targaryen family stronghold was C.G.I.'d upon, anyway. To stand where the impossibly green meadow gives way to gray granite cliffs plummeting toward the sea, as you note the spot where Tyrion and Daenerys argued over strategy, where Jon Snow met Drogon, is to feel the frisson of an epic story meeting an epic landscape.

This reciprocity between project and place extends beyond the countryside. Another reason the marriage between ""Thrones"" and the region has been happier than any on the show is that the production's material needs -- armor, medieval weapons, elaborate costumes and jewelry -- meshed well with the area's longstanding artisanal traditions. ""We're good at that stuff,"" Williams said. Even when a fight was filmed in a place like Morocco, the spears were almost always built in Belfast. Fans who would like to try on a replica of Cersei's crown can often do so at Steensons jewelers in Ballymena, because that's where the original and other Westerosi finery were designed and made. (Though when I stopped in, I was told that the show had commandeered it for Season 8 -- spoiler alert, I guess?) This may be one explanation for the general lack of resentment evident in other locations besieged by ""Thrones"" tourists, like Dubrovnik, the exterior home of King's Landing, which has been almost totally overrun. ""There are not many people in this country who haven't been involved in some direct capacity,"" Boake said. ""Their brother made something for the show, or their sister was an extra, or their cousin worked on an episode."" As we drove along the coast, Robinson reminisced about his time as Hodor's double, dodging White Walker stuntmen in the Three-Eyed Raven's cave as he dragged Bran's double toward a green screen, in one of the show's most famous scenes. ""Then Kristian Nairn held the door,"" he said. ""He did the easy bit."" Robinson, 52, was a former carpenter laid low by the global financial crisis, working as a tour guide when he applied to be a ""Thrones"" extra. Soon he was facing off with the likes of Lena Headey and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as a stand-in for the undead Mountain, a stint that became the hook for his Giant Tours, which takes small groups of ""Thrones"" fans up and down the coast.

The show has done the same for the region's movie industry. A few films had been shot in Belfast's cavernous old ship painting hall, now part of Titanic Studios (so named because it's near where the doomed ocean liner, the city's other most famous export , was built). But since ""Thrones"" took up residence there, it has turbocharged the business, conferring the credibility that comes from hosting the most elaborate TV series in history and training a generation of crew and craftspeople. Belfast has since added another enormous studio complex, Belfast Harbour Studios, the current home of Syfy's Superman prequel series ""Krypton,"" and postproduction houses like Yellowmoon, which worked on ""Thrones,"" have significantly expanded. Then there's the measurable financial impact: Over eight seasons, ""Game of Thrones"" has spent more than $275 million in the region, according to Northern Ireland Screen. Of course, two big questions hang over all the success. One involves how Brexit might affect the industry, though Williams notes that for the large-scale productions that are Belfast's bread and butter, significantly more production spending comes from the United States than the European Union. The other: What happens now that ""Thrones"" is over? While everyone is cautiously optimistic that the planned ""Thrones"" prequel will go forward as a series, especially given the interest HBO's new owner, AT&T, will have in extending such a lucrative franchise, they aren't reliant upon it. ""We're getting calls every week,"" Williams said.

The most common analogy holds that ""Thrones"" is to Northern Ireland what the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies were to New Zealand -- a pop culture phenomenon that showcased a wondrous land for a global audience. But one difference is that ""Thrones"" has helped to redefine a city once known as one of the most dangerous places on earth. From the late 1960s to the late 1990s, the Troubles, which pit Protestant paramilitary groups loyal to the Crown against Catholic ones in favor of a unified, independent Ireland, claimed some 3,600 lives in bombings, sniper attacks and bloody street battles that ripped Belfast apart. Old divisions remain and have been infused with new anxiety by Brexit, because its unclear how it will affect the open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. But the show has helped ""continue our peace process,"" said Conleth Hill, better known to ""Thrones"" fans as the cunning Varys. As one of the few actors from Northern Ireland in the cast -- he grew up and still lives in Ballycastle -- Hill has observed the show's impact from both inside and out. ""Before the Troubles, there was loads of tourists coming through my town,"" he said. ""Now they're coming again.""

A still more immersive wallow in ""Thrones""dom awaited me at Castle Ward, about an hour south of the city. The guide William Van der Kells greeted me in full Northern regalia: a black cloak and faux fur collar with a shiny gauntlet on one hand, holding a large sword made of ""the finest Valyrian rubber."" A longtime National Trust site, Castle Ward added a ""Winterfell tour"" after the show shot much of the first season on the property, and promptly brought in more than 25,000 additional visitors a year. The Stark castle was based around the 1610 tower house, the same one Bran climbed to discover Jaime and Cersei in flagrante twincestus. We shot arrows on the spot in the courtyard the Stark children did in one of the first scenes of the series, a few yards from where Tyrion smacked Joffrey in one of the show's most GIF-able moments. Then we drove through a driving rain to other locations on the property, like the tree where Robb Stark and Talisa fatefully tied the knot, before taking cover beneath an old castle near the site of Walder Frey's (digitally projected) one, where it all ended badly. ""Around here you get all four seasons in a day,"" Van der Kells said. By then, I was wearing the cloak and snapping my own selfies to send to my daughter. The only shadow monster in evidence was the storm cloud dumping rain on me. But as I peered through the gloom and fog at the choppy Strangford Lough, it occurred to me that while I'd come to see how ""Game of Thrones"" had redefined Northern Ireland, what struck me most was how Northern Ireland had defined it.","As the spiritual and production home of HBO's sprawling fantasy drama, Northern Ireland has been transformed by the show.

Also, ""the light is lower, a little more discreet and softer.""

For maximum impact, he suggested using them in multiples.

Opinion,This Is One Anxiety We Should Eliminate for the Coronavirus Outbreak,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/opinion/surprise-billing-coronavirus-.html,"This Is One Anxiety We Should Eliminate for the Coronavirus Outbreak

In his recent Oval Office speech, President Trump pledged that Americans won't receive surprise bills for their coronavirus testing. The goal is good; we need people who are lightly symptomatic to be tested without fear of high personal costs. But it was an empty promise. Unless swift action is taken, surprise bills are coming. And they could exacerbate a public health crisis that is already threatening to spiral out of control. As demand for coronavirus testing surges and beds start to fill with the sick, hospitals and clinics will roll out contingency plans that call on any available resources in their communities. Test samples will be sent to whichever private laboratories have capacity, patients will be transferred from overloaded hospitals to less-crowded locations and physicians and nurses will make greater use of telemedicine. Emergency rooms will be slammed with visits from the worried well and the dangerously sick alike. College students are already being sent home and will seek treatment far from the universities that offer them health insurance.

All of this will be chaotic. To their credit, health insurers recognize the need to eliminate out-of-pocket spending that might discourage people from seeking care. At a meeting earlier this week with Vice President Mike Pence, they publicly committed to eliminating deductibles and co-pays for coronavirus testing. The federal government is also taking some needed steps to eliminate or ease cost-sharing. But insurance companies aren't the ones sending surprise bills. They're coming from private labs and emergency-room doctors and other providers of health care services -- and they weren't at Vice President Pence's meeting. A patient with insurance through work or the health-insurance exchanges can be surprise-billed when she seeks medical care at a hospital or clinic that's in her insurance ""network"" -- but then receives medical care from a person or an institution that's outside the network. That out-of-network provider will first send a bill to the patient's insurer. But if the insurer doesn't pay the full amount, the provider may bill the patient directly for the remaining balance. Because the provider is basically free to name its own price, these surprise bills can be wildly inflated. In a coronavirus pandemic, a patient can do everything right and still face substantial surprise bills. Take someone who fears that she may have contracted Covid-19. After self-quarantining for a week, she develops severe shortness of breath. Her partner rushes her to the nearest in-network emergency room. But she's actually seen by an out-of-network doctor -- who may soon send her a hefty bill for the visit.

Matters get worse if the in-network hospital is approaching capacity and the patient is healthy enough to be sent to a hospital across town with spare beds. If the second hospital is outside her insurance network, she could potentially receive a second surprise bill. A third could come from the ambulance that transfers her -- it too might not be in-network, and no one will think to check during a crisis. She could get a fourth surprise bill if her coronavirus tests are sent to an out-of-network lab. And so on. Even in normal times, patients with private insurance receive roughly one surprise bill for every 10 inpatient hospital admissions. These are not normal times. Federal law currently provides little protection. The Affordable Care Act does cap an individual's out-of-pocket spending -- but the cap only applies to in-network care. For surprise bills, the sky is the limit. Reputable providers will appreciate that now is not the time for price gouging. But many won't and will seek to exploit people's medical needs for financial gain, much as they did before the coronavirus began to spread. They may calculate that can collect enough money charging exorbitant fees for out-of-network services -- and still make it to an airport ahead of a mob carrying pitchforks and torches. We need more than gauzy commitments from the president. We need a law to ban bills incurred from out-of-network providers for medical care associated with the coronavirus outbreak. Unless that commitment is ironclad, people may not believe it. And if they don't believe it, they won't get tested. To date, Congress -- cowed by a furious public relations campaign led by private equity and specialty physicians -- has been unable to pass a law banning routine surprise billing. Though Congress has moved closer to a watered-down deal in recent months, neither the House nor the Senate has actually passed a bill. The coronavirus should refocus Congress's attention. At a minimum, the legislature should quickly pass a temporary measure to limit out-of-network charges for coronavirus testing and treatment.

In the meantime, states can take action. About half have already passed surprise-billing laws, including California and New York, two of the hardest-hit states. But the laws in many states are patchy: Some cover only emergency room care, others don't contain a legal mechanism for cutting back on excessive bills, and none are tailored for the current outbreak. Already, reports of people who have received eye-popping bills for coronavirus testing or emergency room visits are circulating. As these stories proliferate, people will become even more reluctant to get tested or treated when they should. That will obscure the spread of the virus, complicate efforts to adopt measures for social distancing, and lead to unnecessary deaths. It's a national disgrace that the United States didn't ban surprise bills in a time of relative prosperity and security. It could become a public health calamity if we do not end them in a world with coronavirus.",A patient can do everything right and still face substantial surprise medical bills.,46b46fb5-4f9a-580d-ba86-8592c58bb5b3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/15/opinion/15anderson-bagley-1/15anderson-bagley-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=878b53fa8584055dfd346b116181778f00b9466830b9296207b3de9ad4806436&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A lab test at the Northwell Health Labs in Lake Success, N.Y., this week.",46b46fb5-4f9a-580d-ba86-8592c58bb5b3,N24News/imgs/46b46fb5-4f9a-580d-ba86-8592c58bb5b3.jpg,11
Health,How to Quarantine Yourself,https://www.nytimes.com/article/quarantine-coronavirus.html,"Stay home unless you must see a doctor. No trips to the office or school, no shopping. If you must come out of your room, wear a mask. And don't share towels. If you are among the thousands of Americans now self-quarantined because of possible infection with the coronavirus, these are a few of the new house rules, courtesy of your local health officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Self-quarantine and self-isolation are different. The first measure is for the large numbers of healthy people who may fall sick following possible exposure. The second is for people who are ill with the coronavirus -- they are a danger to their family and visitors, and must be watched carefully in case they deteriorate. At the moment, with testing still scarce in much of the country, it is hard for many Americans to know whether they are infected or just being prudent.

State and local governments generally have the power not just to advise quarantine but to order it. The circumstances under which they do so may change frequently, as the perceived threats change. Countries around the world have instituted bans for travelers, many of which include requiring or requesting that travelers self-quarantine on their arrival. (In the United States, state-by-state travel is also being scrutinized.) A growing number of people are self-quarantining because they were exposed to a friend or colleague who is sick. Millions of other Americans have also been asked to stay in and venture out only for necessities in an effort to stem the disease's spread. It may sound like a vacation from reality, an ideal time to binge on Netflix and catch up on sleep. In fact, it's not easy to lock yourself away from family and friends. There are practical and logistical challenges, and yawning gaps in the official advice that make it even harder. Home quarantine can be unpleasant and will probably last for two weeks, which is the presumed incubation period for the virus. It is especially challenging if you have young children or elderly relatives to care for, or live in cramped quarters with a lot of roommates.

Separation If you are potentially infectious, it is important that you separate yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your elderly aunt. To be on the safe side, you shouldn't even pet your dog, according to the C.D.C., although pets are not known to transmit the coronavirus. A room must be designated for your exclusive use. A bathroom should be, too, if possible. Every surface you cough on or touch could become contaminated with the virus. You should have no visitors, and keep three to six feet away from others. Don't take the bus or subway, or even a taxi. Masks If you must be around other people -- in your home, or in a car, because you're on your way to see a doctor (only after you have called) -- you should wear a mask, and everyone else should, too. But first, you or one of your friends or family members have to find masks, which are sold out almost everywhere. If you can't, you can create a makeshift one from a scarf or other garment. Hygiene If you cough or sneeze, you should cover your mouth and nose with a tissue, and discard the used tissue in a lined trash can. Then you must immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

Disinfect Don't share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels or bedding with anyone (including your pets). Wash these items after you use them. Countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathroom fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables are considered ""high-touch surfaces"" -- wipe them often with a household cleanser. Frequently wipe down surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids, including blood and stool. Monitoring Keep an eye on your health and call a doctor if you develop symptoms or if they worsen. Make sure to tell the medical staff that you are at risk of infection with the coronavirus. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Household members Housemates can go to work or school, but it's going to be their job to stock up on groceries, pick up prescriptions, take care of the quarantined and keep the place clean. They'll be wiping down doorknobs and countertops, doing loads of laundry and washing their hands -- a lot. Family members and other occupants should monitor the patient's symptoms and call a health provider if they see a turn for the worse.

When around a symptomatic patient, household members must wear a face mask, as well as gloves if they have contact with his or her bodily fluids. These should be thrown away immediately, never reused. Elderly members of the household and those with chronic medical conditions risk severe complications, even death, if they become infected. Pregnant women may also be at particular risk, although the data aren't clear. Contact with the secluded individual should be minimized. In China, 70 to 80 percent of transmission occurred within family clusters, according to the World Health Organization. Local governments there were forced to set up isolation wards with thousands of beds in gymnasiums and stadiums to care for people who lived alone or were at risk of infecting their families. Family members should monitor their own health, and contact a doctor if they develop a cough, fever or shortness of breath, signs of Covid-19, the technical name of the illness caused by the coronavirus. Please call first, so the office can prepare for your visit or direct you to a more appropriate site for care. Not everyone can work remotely, and a two-week absence from work can take an enormous financial toll on hourly wage workers who have to clock in and show up to get paid, or who are part of the gig economy with no single employer. However, included in the new $2 trillion stimulus package is jobless aid for many of those required to quarantine. (Who qualifies, how much aid can be collected and more information about the stimulus plan can be found here.)

There is no reimbursement for products you may need, no government home aide to stop by and help out. (Some states, like Washington, are attempting to provide limited assistance.) Self-quarantine is a hardship, both emotional and financial, for those who have families and those who live alone. ""We have to have social interventions to incentivize and support isolation, or we are doomed,"" said Arthur Caplan, professor of bioethics at New York University Langone Medical Center. People with no health insurance, inadequate insurance or no regular doctor will be reluctant to seek care if they have symptoms, fearing steep medical bills, he noted. Undocumented individuals, fearful of being discovered and deported, may avoid diagnosis and care. Major health insurers have said they will waive out of pocket costs for testing and treatment, according to administration officials, and Medicare and Medicaid also will cover the costs. Providing for people who make sacrifices for the greater good is crucial, said Lawrence Gostin, a law professor at Georgetown University and director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. ""We ought to have a social compact: If you're sick, whether you've got Covid-19 or not, you should separate yourself from society,"" Mr. Gostin said. ""That's your part of the bargain, you're doing it for your neighbors, your family and your community.""",Thousands who may have been exposed to the coronavirus have been asked to seclude themselves.

Along with Troy Schumacher, he has worked frequently with Mr. Peck, who has featured him in all of his works for the company and has called him ""one of the purest interpreters of movement that I've come across.""

Mr. Stanley started studying ballet at 3 in West Chester, Pa., where he trained at the Rock School for Dance Education and also studied tap and jazz. He has always picked up movement quickly, he said; even as a child, he could instantly mimic what he had just seen onstage. ""Maybe that's part of my hard-wiring,"" he said. ""But I could write you a list of things I'm not fast in to make up for it.""

Economy,"Still Reeling From Oil Plunge, Texas Faces New Threat: Surge in Virus Cases",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/business/economy/texas-economy-oil-coronavirus.html,"HOUSTON -- Things were looking up for Texas in recent weeks. Oil prices had managed an impressive rebound, more than doubling to just above $40 a barrel. Restaurants and small businesses were opening up in Houston, Dallas and elsewhere. And tens of thousands of people were getting back to work. But a recent surge in coronavirus cases in the state is messing up that neat recovery story. Small businesses that had just reopened are closing again and oil prices have slid below $40 a barrel after weeks of gains. Energy executives say they remain optimistic, but some analysts are worried about the Texas economy, which would be the world's 10th biggest if the state were a country. Since businesses began reopening in early May, after a four-week statewide stay-at-home order by Gov. Greg Abbott that was only loosely enforced in some areas, optimism spread that the coronavirus pandemic was under control. People returned to their dentist offices, gyms and hair salons, and bars began doing brisk business, especially in the oil production hub of West Texas. Many residents of the state, which last backed a Democratic presidential candidate in 1976, considered mask wearing a form of opposition to President Trump. And many business owners were reluctant to force their customers to cover their faces or stay apart.

But starting just after Memorial Day, Texas began to report a rise in coronavirus cases, a trend that has accelerated over the last 10 days. The state has recorded 130,000 cases, and nearly 3,000 deaths. Hospitalizations are on the rise. Fears of the disease spread as grocery stores and restaurants reported that employees were getting sick, and Apple this week closed seven stores in Houston again. Other large retail chains like J.C. Penney, Ikea and Nordstrom said on Thursday that they were monitoring the situation but were keeping their Texas stores open. Restaurant reservations on OpenTable have been dropping in recent days. Data from another online platform, the Home Base scheduling app, showed total hours worked by employees at small businesses were rising until Monday, but then stalled as the week progressed, according to analysts at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. On Friday, Governor Abbott ordered all bars to close effective 12 p.m.

On Thursday, Governor Abbott issued an executive order suspending elective surgery in four populous counties to ensure that hospitals have the space to care for coronavirus patients. He also paused further business reopenings. William Presta, a barbershop owner in the Houston suburb of Bellaire, closed on March 22 and reopened on May 12. Business was going well until this week when demand suddenly dried up, he said, so he has decided to close the shop next week and take a vacation. ""I'm just being conscious and smart and trying to keep out of harm's way,"" he said. Texans are accustomed to a gyrating economy that has long soared and tanked along with oil and natural gas prices. There have been four steep oil downturns in the last four decades. In the 1980s, for example, a sharp drop in oil prices devastated the state's energy companies and banks. Three out of every four petroleum worker lost their jobs. Over the years the state economy has diversified, with medical centers mushrooming in Houston and Dallas, and Austin becoming a technology hub. But energy remains a critical part of the state's economy. The shale fracking revolution has made Texas the leader of a national energy boom and fueled an expansion of petrochemical plants and natural gas export terminals.

* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. At the start of the year, Texas oil and gas companies appeared to be doing OK. The U.S. benchmark oil price hovered around $60 a barrel. When the pandemic took hold, and Russia and Saudi Arabia briefly flooded the market with oil, the price dropped to $20 a barrel in March, and then, in a first, briefly dropped to more than $37 below zero. Oil companies shut down wells and stopped new drilling except when companies were legally obligated to employ rigs under contract. More than 26,000 Texas oil workers -- roughly one in four -- lost their jobs in April, according to state employment data. That was the largest single month of oil and gas layoffs. But the impacts were far greater, rippling across the state, hurting businesses that serve the energy industry and its workers. Regional banks, many of which have large oil-company loan portfolios, are being strained, and investments in pipelines are being delayed.

But oil prices recovered faster than most analysts had expected as producers in the United States, Saudi Arabia, Russia and other countries cut back production. And as many states opened up their economies, gasoline demand started climbing. National average prices at the pump for regular gasoline have increased roughly 10 percent, or 20 cents a gallon, over the last month, according to the AAA motor club. Texas added 237,800 jobs in May, a monthly record, as businesses reopened and oil companies slowly began sending workers into the field to revive shale wells. At nearly $40 barrel, oil is now expensive enough for producers to reopen some wells they had shut. ""The near-term situation in oil markets is undeniably severe, but it is a temporary aberration stemming from an unprecedented health issue,"" said Ray Perryman, an economic consultant in Waco. But despite his overall optimism, Mr. Perryman remains cautious because of the recent surge in coronavirus infections, which he said should have been avoided. ""The spike is higher than necessary due to lack of adherence to safety recommendations and is becoming alarming,"" he said. ""You can't fix the economy if you don't get to a sustainable place on the health crisis."" The Texas oil industry is marked by wildcatters who wear optimism on their sleeves whatever the oil price, in part because low oil prices typically stimulate demand, which in turn pushes prices back up. But the current crisis is fundamentally different because the pandemic has kept demand suppressed even at low prices. Demand for jet fuel, for example, is still subdued because airlines are flying far fewer flights than they normally do this time of the year.

Energy executives say that at $40 a barrel, the U.S. oil price is not high enough for them to hire more workers and drill more wells. They say the price needs to approach $50 a barrel, but few experts expect that to happen until the pandemic is largely under control or an effective vaccine is widely available. ""I'm optimistic to a point,"" said Scott D. Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, a leading Texas oil company. ""If the infection numbers don't level back, it's going to be a tough decision for the governor as to whether or not to put back in place 'shelter in place,' which would be an economic disaster for the state."" Even if the governor does not issue another stay-at-home order, many businesses could decide they have no choice but to shut down because they cannot afford to pay employees with few or no customers coming in the door. Some say closing again would be devastating but not doing so could be, too. Mithu and Shammi Malik had been hoping to open Musaafer, a new Indian restaurant in Houston three years in the making, in March. Instead, the married couple had to wait until May 18 because of state and local public health restrictions. Roughly two weeks after they opened, a few of their employees tested positive for the virus, forcing them to shut down again. The couple decided to give it another shot, and reopened on June 12, and are now nervously monitoring the rise in coronavirus cases and wondering if they will be forced to close their doors yet again. ""You can't ignore that Covid itself is spreading quickly,"" Mr. Malik said. ""We are very much aware that cases are going up.""

Food,Utica Greens: A Central New York Staple With Multiple Identities,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/dining/utica-greens-recipe-italian-american.html,"Sal Borruso, left, and Joe Morelle with a plate of greens Morelle at the Chesterfield Restaurant.

They don't normally call Utica greens Utica greens in Utica. ""Somebody calls here and says they want Utica greens, I tell them we don't have those,"" said Sal Borruso, owner of the Chesterfield Restaurant in this city of 60,000 in central New York. In 1988, Chesterfield's began serving the hearty dish of escarole, fried prosciutto, hot cherry peppers, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and bread crumbs. It went on to become one of those American specialties that are beloved as a regional staple without reaching much further. From Albany to Syracuse, the dish is served in Italian-American restaurants as Utica greens.

""Us being Italian, our grandmothers all made greens,"" Mr. Morelle said. ""They would call it 'scarole. Just sauteed with garlic and olive oil."" Some Uticans remember a more elaborate version of the dish that was served at home tables. Others recall them as Mr. Morelle does: simple, with the possible addition of chickpeas or sausage. ""I did something different with them,"" he said. ""You can't really say invent. But I will take credit for popularizing them."" Escarole is a leafy, slightly bitter winter green in the endive family. Its heads typically weigh more than a pound, and its firm leaves range from dark green to pale white. It was a staple in the backyard gardens of East Utica, where, beginning in the late 1800s, immigrants from southern Italy arrived to work in the mills and on the railroad.

Utica became renowned for its Italian-American cuisine, with specialties that include fried meatballs, sausage rolls, tomato pie and a mildly spicy pasta dish called chicken riggies. In the 1980s, Mr. Morelle was a chef at Grimaldi's Restaurant, a venerated spot that is now closed, where the greens were served as an occasional special. He observed a chef making them, and when he started at Chesterfield's in 1988, he tweaked the dish and put it on the menu as a regular appetizer. It was an immediate hit.

""The place was packed,"" Mr. Borruso recalled. Referring to those days, when Utica was known as Sin City for its political corruption, Mr. Morelle said: ""You knew everybody. On this half was the F.B.I. That half, wiseguys."" The dish varies from menu to menu. Potatoes are added here, salami replaces prosciutto there. In Utica, the name often honors the chef or the house: greens Trunfio, Georgio greens, greens alla Ventura. Local residents frequently call them fried greens or just greens. Versions have popped up at a few restaurants in New York City, Las Vegas and Florida. Years ago, Mr. Morelle quit the restaurant business to work as a postman. He still makes greens, but only on request -- huge trays of them for weddings, birthdays and holidays. As he nursed his drink at Chesterfield's, Mr. Morelle was asked to try the restaurant's version. He took a bite, then another. ""They taste pretty close to mine,"" he said. ""The bread crumb mixture is a little different. A little drier. But they're good. Really good.""","Tracing the origins of an Italian-American dish beloved in the central part of the state, but not much beyond.",27c7f8b8-62a4-59dc-a8e2-352f96e4a6c3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/01/dining/01UTICA2/01UTICA2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=0316aaa68b0d7fd09a93a1a8a4dbd6e18fb8125f17fdabe70aca550f242256d6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Greens Morelle includes escarole, fried prosciutto, hot cherry peppers, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and bread crumbs.",27c7f8b8-62a4-59dc-a8e2-352f96e4a6c3,N24News/imgs/27c7f8b8-62a4-59dc-a8e2-352f96e4a6c3.jpg,17
Theater,"Review: In 'Eddie and Dave,' Van Halen Gets a Makeover",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/theater/eddie-and-dave-review-van-halen-atlantic-theater-company.html,"When it comes to glamorous drag, men who impersonate women have traditionally had an unfair advantage over their female counterparts. Just think of the boundlessly flamboyant options available for guys to transform into gals: baubles, boas, high heels, bouffants, ad infinitum.

As for women doing men, what's their choice, really, beyond business suits and sloppy sweats?

""Eddie and Dave,"" the larky if bloated sketch of a bio-comedy that opened on Tuesday at Stage 2 of the Atlantic Theater Company, helps to correct that imbalance. Its title characters, based on the original guitarist and lead singer of the chart-topping band Van Halen, are indeed men portrayed by women.

But these figures hail from the 1980s, a decade in which big hair and glam metal rock ruled the airwaves. The professional (and often offstage) attire of the male musicians who practiced this earsplitting art embraced a peacock panoply of baubles, boas, high heels and, yes, bouffant coiffures. And it was a look worn not with Dietrich-style elegance, but with swaggering and sweaty machismo.

The female cast members of ""Eddie and Dave,"" written by Amy Staats and directed by Margot Bordelon, appear to be having a high old time finding the testosterone within their characters' teased hair. Swathed in costumes (by Montana Levi Blanco) that might have come from a Ziegfeld girl's trunk and wigs (by Cookie Jordan) that could house a family of squirrels, the angry young rockers of this rambunctious play demonstrate that wearing sequins and fishnets is no guarantee against bad-boy behavior.",Amy Staats's tale of the rowdy rise (and fall and rise and fall) of the rock band lets women loose in the glam metal boys' club.,88c1e575-8c26-53d7-9b85-021cead12624,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/23/arts/23eddiedave1/23eddiedave1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=bf6e8e1bc28de1f06ba892d2b97be35355c6abed954e450d1abeb6a557f20354&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Might as well jump: from left, Adina Verson as Al, Amy Staats as Eddie and Megan Hill as Dave in ""Eddie and Dave"" at the Atlantic Theater Company's Stage 2.",88c1e575-8c26-53d7-9b85-021cead12624,N24News/imgs/88c1e575-8c26-53d7-9b85-021cead12624.jpg,10
Dance,"Sara Mearns, an Explorer Way Beyond Ballet",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/09/arts/dance/sara-mearns-jacobs-pillow.html,"Earlier this summer, Sara Mearns came to a shocking realization: She hadn't worn a pair of point shoes in four and a half weeks. For a ballerina, a point shoe is a second skin. ""I wasn't even thinking about it, because I was dancing,"" Ms. Mearns said. ""Someone joked with me and said, 'You become a modern dancer on your layoffs.'"" Ms. Mearns, a principal with New York City Ballet, sprawled out on a floor in a downtown studio after a recent rehearsal for yet another new project -- a dance in sneakers -- and laughed. ""I do,"" she said. ""I never think twice about, 'oh, God, I'm not doing ballet.' It's always about the people I'm working with and the project.""

To find another ballet dancer who expanded his or her range with such fortitude and ferocity, you'd have to go back to Mikhail Baryshnikov. But he transitioned into modern dance after his ballet career ended. Ms. Mearns is still going strong as a classical dancer. Beginning Wednesday, she will show off her contemporary side in ""Beyond Ballet,"" a program presented by Jacob's Pillow, that includes ""Opulence,"" a new duet by Jodi Melnick; ""No. 1,"" a duet with Honji Wang of the French hip-hop duo Wang Ramirez; and ""Ekstasis,"" a 1933 solo by Martha Graham, reimagined by Virginie Mecene, the former Graham company principal. For Pamela Tatge, the Pillow's director, Ms. Mearns is ""a rare dancer,"" one who is ""able to realize any movement that a choreographer -- as far as I've seen -- puts in front of her."" It's getting to the point where Ms. Mearns could have her own branch on the modern dance tree. So far, her repertory has included dances by modern masters like Graham, Isadora Duncan and Merce Cunningham, and contemporary choreographers including Jodi Melnick, Pam Tanowitz and Christopher Williams.

""Every time I say yes,"" Ms. Mearns said, ""I'm like, I don't know if I can do this, but I'm not going to say no. I'm not going to say no to Cunningham. I'm not going to say no to Martha Graham. I'm just going to try and do my best."" As a classical dancer, Ms. Mearns has a power and command that few share; in modern works, she is more contained, but still glitteringly present. The only thing that seems to scare her is the possibility of not trying hard enough. For ""Night of 100 Solos: A Centennial Event,"" which celebrated the centenary of Merce Cunningham, Ms. Mearns shared the stage with accomplished contemporary dancers. From the start, she was remarkable in material that is almost impossible to master -- her fearlessness and precision shifted the mood: Suddenly, the stage was a place of a heightened, incandescent alertness. After performing her third solo, Ms. Mearns went into the hallway and cried. (She isn't the type to hide her emotions on or off the stage.) ""It was out of pure joy,"" she said. ""I put everything I could into it and I took chances, and I couldn't believe it when I came off. I haven't had that feeling in a very long time.""

As she looks beyond ballet, Ms. Mearns's artistic path is more internal, more personal. ""It's not a P.R. thing, it's not a way to get attention. It's, 'What is a collaboration that no one has done before?' It doesn't have to be commercial and it doesn't have to make money for it to be successful."" She would rather unleash her creativity with choreographers like Ms. Melnick, who inspired Ms. Mearns to expand her dance horizons in the first place. (They met at Danspace Project in a 2015 platform that paired contemporary dance artists and those with backgrounds with Cunningham and City Ballet.) Ms. Melnick comes out of postmodern dance and has worked with artists including Twyla Tharp, Trisha Brown, Sara Rudner and Mr. Baryshnikov. Her finely wrought movement is a chain of complex articulations and shifts of weight that have an effortless way of peeling or slipping silkily off the body. Ms. Melnick's sophisticated choreography is neither flashy nor full of the indistinguishable posturing often found in contemporary ballet, and Ms. Mearns is obsessed with it. But it's not just the dancing: Through her exposure to Ms. Melnick, Ms. Mearns's taste has become more refined .

After they collaborated on ""Working in Process/New Bodies"" for Works and & Process at the Guggenheim, Ms. Mearns asked Ms. Melnick to choreograph a duet for the two of them. ""She was very adamant and serious about dancing with me,"" Ms. Melnick said. Though she prefers to work alone at the start of any process -- ""that loneliness factor is really important to me,"" Ms. Melnick said -- Ms. Mearns wore her down, and she had a partner in the studio last fall. As they worked together, Ms. Mearns would follow along behind Ms. Melnick. ""When something happened that I felt was of interest to her or to me, I would stop and teach it to her,"" Ms. Melnick said. ""It kind of reminded me of processes that I've been in with other choreographers where you don't question or judge."" But in late December, Ms. Melnick was involved in a motorcycle accident; her ankle was severely damaged. She didn't start walking again until the end of March and remains in considerable pain. ""I was like, O.K.,"" Ms. Melnick said. ""Kind of like, game over, and then after talking to my surgeons and Sara -- she was like, 'Don't make a decision, let's just get back into the studio and see what happens.' If it wasn't for her, I'd probably still be not dancing or not even doing this well in my recovery."" For the duet, ""Opulence,"" they will perform in sneakers; Ms. Melnick is exploring how seemingly simple movement can have many facets. ""There's something that feels very opulent in cutting things down and keeping it very minimal,"" she said.

Ms. Mearns loves challenges, and Ms. Melnick's work is full of them. ""She's helped me be more in tune in my own body and to not just move through things and throw things away -- because she never does that ever,"" Ms. Mearns said. ""It helps me move better in ballet. After doing all of this, I feel like I am feeling things differently and improving as I'm getting older."" And they have become friends. ""Half of our rehearsals are therapy sessions and then we dance at the end,"" Ms. Mearns said. And Ms. Melnick's influence expands beyond her own work. Now, in both her work at City Ballet and beyond, Ms. Mearns can grasp the allure and power of simplicity. She also relishes the ability to stay open, which, for her, is what any ballerina should be in the modern age. But what is not on her list at all? Broadway -- though she starred last spring in the Encores! production of ""I Married an Angel,"" which was choreographed and directed by her husband, Joshua Bergasse, who works in musical theater. That was a labor of love and, it turned out, an important step in her artistic development: She learned that she can speak onstage, and that she has comic timing. ""When you hear that laugh, you're just like, that's good,"" she said, her deep voice lowering another octave for emphasis. ""That is good."" But the politics and the commercial aspect of the Broadway world trouble her. ""It's not successful unless you make money, unless your investors are happy and unless you get a laugh out of the audience,"" she said. ""That, for me, is not fulfilling. But my husband loves it, and that's what he grew up on. And also he likes to make good theater. He doesn't just want to do huge moneymakers. Right now that is really hard because everything is just taking movies and making them into musicals.""

In the coming months, she will perform a new duet by Kim Brandstrup alongside her City Ballet colleague Taylor Stanley at the Fall for Dance Festival and work with Ms. Melnick and the filmmaker Charles Atlas as part of a residency at Baryshnikov Arts Center. There's more; she just can't talk about it yet. But she did bring up an ultimate dream: to work with Mr. Baryshnikov. ""I don't even know how that would happen or how that would work,"" she said. ""We chat and we talk, but I don't even know what it would be."" She paused and a panicked expression washed over her face: ""How do I make that happen?"" Ms. Mearns will stay open.

Health,Considering the Side Effects of Drugmakers' Money-Back Guarantees,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/health/prescription-drugs-cost.html,"This article is a collaboration between The Times and ProPublica, the independent nonprofit investigative-journalism organization. More than a decade ago, Italy tried a novel approach to help bring down drug costs: asking pharmaceutical companies to return money to the national health system if some of their medicines failed to work as expected. The effort largely flopped. The Trump administration is now considering whether to encourage a similar approach. Pharmaceutical executives presented the idea to President Trump at a meeting in January, and the general concept was raised last month in a draft executive order aimed at combating rising drug prices. A number of drug companies have recently entered into such deals, which they call outcomes-based contracts. Merck has done so for its diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet, promising to return money if patients' diabetes did not meet goals for control. And Novartis, which makes the heart failure treatment Entresto, is refunding money if too many patients taking the drug are hospitalized. In more typical deals, drugmakers pay rebates to insurers based on the number of drugs sold and to gain easier access for members to their products.

But there is scant evidence this new approach lowers costs. Pharmaceutical companies still set the drug's list price and have to agree to the criteria upon which they will be measured. Some experts say such arrangements are a ploy to deflect attention from substantive changes that could hurt companies' bottom lines, such as allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Moreover, the savings don't always trickle down to consumers. ""Most of them get launched with great fanfare,"" said Dr. Steve Miller, the chief medical officer at Express Scripts, which manages the drug benefits of more than 80 million Americans. ""But then you never hear anything about it after the launch because most of them collapse under their own weight."" In a recent note to investors, David Maris, an analyst at Wells Fargo, described the approach as a ""carnival game"" and said he did not know of any such arrangements ""where a drug company did not consider it a win for them."" Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry trade group, said the approach was in keeping with a trend toward paying doctors and hospitals for the quality of care they deliver rather than the number of services they provide.

To understand how these deals work, consider the one that the drugmaker Amgen made with Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a nonprofit insurer in Massachusetts and one of the insurers to most aggressively test the concept. It has entered into at least eight such deals over the past two years. This spring, Amgen agreed to pay a full refund to Harvard Pilgrim if patients who took its pricey new cholesterol drug, Repatha, suffered a heart attack or stroke. Repatha is intended for patients with very high cholesterol levels, for which cheaper drugs, known as statins, do not work. As part of such deals, insurers eased restrictions on which patients could gain access to the drug, said Dr. Joshua J. Ofman, a senior vice president at Amgen. Sales of Repatha and similar drugs have disappointed in part because insurers have been reluctant to pay for them given their price. If Harvard Pilgrim patients taking Repatha have a heart attack or stroke, they share in the refund, getting back all out-of-pocket payments that they have made toward the drug, said Dr. Michael Sherman, chief medical officer at Harvard Pilgrim. Doctors who prescribe Repatha said the deals do not affect how they treat patients. ""We're completely agnostic to it,"" said Dr. Frederic S. Resnic, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Lahey Hospital & Medical Center in Burlington, Mass., who sees patients with Harvard Pilgrim insurance. The drugs are so costly that doctors still only prescribe them when patients really need them, he said. Dr. Peter B. Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, is skeptical. He said the pharmaceutical industry is conflating setting drug prices based on the value they bring to patients and the health care system, which he supports, with negotiating givebacks when patients don't respond to drugs, which he sees as too little, too late. The arrangements, he said, carried ""bells and whistles"" that made them look good in theory. ""But as long as you control all the contract terms, it can be a lot of optics but no substance,"" he said.

Dr. Bach and others say the pharmaceutical industry is using this approach to justify seeking major changes to federal regulations that could benefit them even more -- including rolling back a requirement that Medicaid programs for the poor get the lowest drug prices, and another that bars companies from giving kickbacks to health providers. The industry says the changes are needed to allow more flexibility in the type of deals they can offer. Drug companies and insurers touted these contracts when they were announced, but participants in several deals either declined to comment recently or provided little information about their programs.

At a conference last month in Virginia, a senior director with Prime Therapeutics, a pharmacy benefit manager, offered a blunt assessment of such contracts, saying they were not cost-effective. But in a phone interview, his boss, David Lassen, the chief clinical officer, was a bit more measured, saying that though the deals carry promise, the work to track patient outcomes is expensive and burdensome. ""In their current state, where they're falling short is where you look at the return on investment,"" Mr. Lassen said. Dr. Sherman at Harvard Pilgrim said the deals would not work for every drug and that drugmakers typically showed no interest when there were no competing brand-name drugs that worked in a similar way. Some pharmaceutical executives acknowledge the model should not be seen as a panacea. Leonard S. Schleifer, the chief executive of Regeneron, questioned how such pricing would work for a drug like Dupixent, an eczema drug his company makes that was approved this year. ""Are we going to start calculating the surface area of the rash that's improved?"" said Dr. Schleifer, whose company has entered into some outcomes-based deals for Praluent, a competitor to Repatha.","The Trump administration is considering encouraging lowering drug costs through outcome-based contracts, but there is little evidence the approach works.",6f304f03-3b81-501d-95af-598a9009858e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/08/science/11DRUGPRICING1/11DRUGPRICING1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=76d7bcdf09e60c996ed6d494ce7d073e0228b5301d0dee74bdc02a4f259a0356&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Tablets of Januvia, a diabetes medicine created by Merck.

Food,My Favorite New Recipe!,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/dining/my-favorite-new-recipe.html,"Good morning. We're three weeks from Black Friday, and the time before Thanksgiving is going to go very slowly until it takes off like a scalded dog. Smarties should lay down a few plans this weekend against the surety that they will change in coming days -- as when news arrives that your aunt is coming in from Chicago for the holiday. Read the rider: She doesn't eat turkey, doesn't care for the taste; wants an oaky chardonnay regardless and quite a bit of it; she will bring her own pillows.

O.K., so! Make a guest list this weekend. Inquire about dietary restrictions. See what you're going to do about rustling up a turkey, and then either order it from your butcher or farmers' market, or set an alarm on your phone so you don't miss the pickup at the cash-only, no-reservations spot 60 miles away. Don't have a slow cooker? Wirecutter has a favorite, and it's an invaluable Thanksgiving addition when the oven's jammed with bird and fixings, useful for keeping mashed potatoes warm, or dressing, or a huge vat of gravy.

You have enough chairs? The table large enough? You need a loving cup? Et cetera. I know these are early days yet, but it's like Eisenhower said about war. Plans are useless. It's the planning that's indispensable.

And then for the rest of the weekend, have fun. For The New York Times Magazine this week I wrote about the brilliant culinary historian and cook Toni Tipton-Martin, whose ""Jubilee: Recipes From Two Centuries of African-American Cooking"" was published on Tuesday. To go with the column, I highlighted Tipton-Martin's recipe for pork chops in a roux-thickened lemon-caper sauce (above), which has been one of the highlights of my cooking exploits this fall. I hope it will become one of yours as well. It's just fantastic: tangy and rich and comforting, a total delight to cook and to eat.","Make Toni Tipton-Martin's pork chops in a roux-thickened lemon-caper sauce, a total delight to cook and eat.",5b8c24a3-0faf-56d8-ac6a-5ea329aeadec,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/10/magazine/10mag-eat-copy/10mag-eat-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=492350fb3448e5e549d5575bed58076473d59b5238280f49494c778854ed203f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Sam Sifton's pork chops in lemon-caper sauce.,5b8c24a3-0faf-56d8-ac6a-5ea329aeadec,N24News/imgs/5b8c24a3-0faf-56d8-ac6a-5ea329aeadec.jpg,17
Health,Kentucky Rushes to Remake Medicaid as Other States Prepare to Follow,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/health/kentucky-medicaid-work-requirement.html,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- With approval from the Trump administration fresh in hand, Kentucky is rushing to roll out its first-in-the-nation plan to require many Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer or train for a job -- even as critics mount a legal challenge to stop it on the grounds that it violates the basic tenets of the program. At least eight other Republican-led states are hoping to follow -- a ninth, Indiana, has already won permission to do so -- and some want to go even further by imposing time limits on coverage. Such restrictions are central to Republican efforts to profoundly change Medicaid, the safety net program that has provided free health insurance to tens of millions of low-income Americans for more than 50 years. The ballooning deficits created by the budget deal that President Trump signed into law Friday and the recent tax bill are likely to add urgency to the party's attempts to wring savings from entitlement programs. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said Thursday that addressing entitlement spending is ""what you need to do to fully deal with this debt crisis,"" though Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader from Kentucky, said he has ruled out doing so this year.

The ""rewards dollars"" that many will need to earn to get their teeth cleaned or their vision checked? They'll be tracked through a new online platform, where Medicaid recipients will also be expected to upload their work, volunteer or training hours. ""I know it sounds a little bit complicated,"" Ms. Putnam conceded as the group meeting with her, which has overseen efforts to enroll Louisville residents in health insurance in the Obamacare era, jotted notes. Someone heaved a sigh. After four years of signing up thousands of people for coverage under the health law's expansion of the Medicaid program, Mr. Wagner told the room, ""We're shifting our focus from helping people gain coverage to helping people keep it.""

The rationale of Gov. Matt Bevin and other supporters is that Medicaid was created for the most vulnerable citizens -- those who aren't only poor, but pregnant, elderly, children or disabled -- and that for everyone else, working or otherwise engaging in their community will provide dignity and better health. About 500,000 Kentuckians have joined the Medicaid rolls under the Obamacare expansion, and the state estimates some 350,000 will be subject to the new work rules. While the work requirement is unprecedented in the history of Medicaid, Mr. Wagner and others say they're just as concerned about other new rules that will be confusing and hard to follow. For example, many adults who don't pay their small premiums can be locked out of Medicaid for six months, unless they complete a financial or health literacy course. Others will lose access to dental and vision care. Critics of the plan point to Indiana, which dropped about 25,000 adults from its Medicaid program from 2015 through 2017 for failing to pay premiums there. About half found other coverage, according to state surveys, typically through a job.

Mark Lee Coleman, a diabetic who was visiting a busy clinic run by Family Health Centers, the nonprofit network that Mr. Wagner heads, one recent morning, had heard next to nothing about the new rules. He needed refills on his medications; his blood sugar level had climbed so high without them that he risked falling into a diabetic coma. But first Mr. Coleman needed help figuring out why his Medicaid coverage had been canceled late last year, even before the new rules kicked in. A counselor at the clinic called the state Medicaid office and found out Mr. Coleman, 49, had forgotten to report a change in income last July, when he switched from a higher-paying job at an Amazon warehouse to a less physically demanding job as a parts driver for Pep Boys, the automotive chain. After she helped him email a pay stub to the office, his coverage was set to be reinstated within a few days. Once Kentucky's new rules take effect this spring and summer, Mr. Coleman will also have to report a monthly tally of his work hours to keep his coverage.

He now works 20 hours a week, but he has neuropathy, a numbness and tingling in his hands and feet, and sometimes has trouble walking. Should he cut back his hours, he'd either have to try to get classified as ""medically frail,"" which would exempt him from the work rule, or lose his coverage. He hasn't thought all that through yet. In concept, though, he supports work requirements -- as do most voters, polls have found. ""That's not bad, to tell you the truth,"" he said. ""If you're working, that's good for your health."" As he spoke, he gulped water from a bottle he kept refilling -- his extreme thirst a sign of his health crisis. Kara Peers, a case worker at Family Health Centers, tried to gauge what other challenges he and his wife and four children might be facing that could interfere with his ability to manage his disease.

""Utilities -- are you able to pay the bill?"" He left with a month's worth of medications -- three for diabetes, one for high blood pressure, paid for by the clinic -- and the reassurance that his Medicaid would soon be reinstated. Melissa Mather, the communications director at Family Health Centers, said she worried that patients like him, who already stumble over Medicaid's paperwork requirements, will be more lost under the new rules. She and Mr. Wagner are also worried about their homeless patients, who will be subject to the rules unless they meet the federal definition of ""chronically homeless"" and get an exemption. ""This is a very, very big concern from my perspective -- talking about the complexity of these changes when a lot of the folks we deal with have lives that are in chaos already,"" she said.

For now, there are more questions than answers, as state workers like Ms. Putnam hustle to iron out all the details, let alone explain them. Sarah and Matt Burress got Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act after Mr. Burress left a factory job to start his own business. The new coverage may have saved Mr. Burress's eyesight -- though only 29, he was diagnosed with glaucoma when he went for a routine eye check shortly after becoming insured in 2016. Now he's worried about keeping his coverage because he runs his own small lawn care business, working irregular hours with a hiatus that lasts all winter. ""We haven't heard how it will work for seasonal self-employed workers,"" said Ms. Burress, who works part time as an office manager. ""Do his clients have to say, 'Yeah, he mowed my grass this week?' Part of it feels like they're trying to catch you, by burying people in paperwork and making it a huge inconvenience.""

She added that she and her husband plan to remain on Medicaid only until his business starts turning a profit. ""This was never meant to be our permanent fix,"" she said, not the ""dead-end entitlement trap"" that Mr. Bevin rails against. Most people on Medicaid do work, research has found; Those who don't often are disabled, even though they may not qualify for Social Security Disability Insurance. Sheila Penney, 54, has cycled in and out of jobs for years with chronic depression and anxiety that started when she lost her father at 16. She has worked as a package handler, a boat reservations manager and even a health insurance enrollment counselor, helping patients at Family Health Centers sign up for Medicaid back in 2014. But she has not worked at all for the last two years, focusing instead on getting her mental health problems under control and relying on her mother to pay her rent. Now she's a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed last month to stop Kentucky's new requirements from taking effect. With Medicaid, she is able to go weekly to a therapist and monthly to a psychiatric nurse practitioner who adjusts her medication, she said.

""I'm wanting to go back to work, but if I was told, 'You have to go back,' I do think that would step up my anxiety,"" Ms. Penney said. ""Volunteering would be less pressure, but you would still want to be consistent and reliable."" Caring full time for a child or other family member can also count toward the work requirement, as can going to school full time, though neither will apply to Ms. Penney. She expects she will find a way to pay the new premiums she'll owe under the plan -- $4 a month -- but predicts it will mean going without other necessities at times. (She is poor enough under the new rules that if she fails to pay them, she will lose access to dental and vision coverage but not be dropped from coverage altogether.)

""I was at the store yesterday, looking in my wallet and going, 'Do I have enough money for dog food?"" she said. ""The thought of taking on even one more expense feels overwhelming."" For Kimberly Dandridge, who overcame breast cancer and addiction to crack cocaine earlier in her life, Medicaid is a bridge while she works toward a job that comes with benefits. Ms. Dandridge, 53, works 30 hours a week as an administrative assistant, and said she would have no trouble meeting the premium and work requirements -- but could relate to those who might. ""I remember there was a time I was just down, in the gutter, so low and broken,"" she said. ""If people like that need medical attention, just let them get it.""","The state will require many people to work, volunteer or train for a job to qualify for coverage — and to prove it with frequent documentation.",b92950a5-55f2-59be-9834-ecd4243d51b0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/06/science/00KENTUCKY1/00KENTUCKY1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=b3104061d17bbad9677a2b835862678b9305e06aeb49f3c2868782a24d035b89&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mark Lee Coleman, right, getting blood work done at the Family Health Centers in Louisville.

Art & Design,"Highway 61 Revisited, With Jessica Lange",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/25/arts/design/jessica-lange-photography.html,"Jessica Lange in Netflix's Manhattan office. Ms. Lange, who is appearing in Netflix's new series, ""The Politician,"" is publishing a book of photographs, titled ""Highway 61.""





DULUTH, Minn. -- When Jessica Lange finally admitted that her driving was a bit unpredictable it came as a relief. I was afraid to bring it up from the passenger seat. ""My kids used to say, 'Mom, pick a lane!'"" the two-time Oscar winner said, chuckling. On a day with silvery light coming through clouds and Lake Superior to our right, she was piloting us northward from Duluth , on Highway 61. We had a perfect car for an August road trip: her green 1967 Mercedes-Benz 250S, heavy as a tank and with seatbelts of questionable functionality. But Ms. Lange exuded confidence and so I didn't worry too much. She knew where she was going. For her, a Minnesota native who summers in what she called a cabin an hour or so away , Highway 61 was more than a conveyance; it was a creative wellspring dating back to her childhood. In fact, this was Ms. Lange's third trip along this route over the summer, toward towns with names like Castle Danger and Beaver Bay, past dense stands of trees and signs for smoked fish and homemade pies. The road itself is the subject of her latest book of photographs, ""Highway 61,"" which comes out Oct. 1.

Inside, the 84 black-and-white photographs document all manner of life along 61, which runs -- first as a state road, then for most of its route as a United States highway -- from the Canadian border down to New Orleans, a city where she lived and owned a home for a time. She was born in the town of Cloquet, Minn., and the route was a central artery for her family, but the book also chronicles the changes she has witnessed -- stretches of the road that she describes as ""empty, forlorn, as if in mourning for what has gone missing."" It's not that Ms. Lange, 70, who starred in ""Tootsie,"" ""Grey Gardens"" and dozens of other movies and TV shows, has given up acting. Her latest production from Ryan Murphy -- who kept her busy through many seasons of ""American Horror Story,"" which earned her two of her three Emmys -- is ""The Politician,"" which debuts Friday on Netflix. But photography is much more than a hobby for her, as I discovered over our four-hour road trip. Wherever we stopped, she paused to take photographs.

Ms. Lange, though now based in New York, has spent time over the last six years documenting all eight states where Highway 61 unfolds. In the book's afterword, Ms. Lange writes about how her first album purchase was ""Highway 61 Revisited,"" released in 1965 by Bob Dylan, a fellow Minnesotan. When she left home at 18, she hit the road, ""headed south out of town,"" she wrote, ""on my way to Europe and beyond, the start of a new life."" The photographs themselves are grainy, suffused with intense light and shadow, capturing small moments featuring people, road signs, horizons, carnivals, diners. The book's cover has one of her most striking images, an African-American child looking right at the camera with an intense gaze. ""It's expressive, emotional street photography,"" said the veteran dealer Howard Greenberg, who is giving Ms. Lange a show of the Highway 61 images from Nov. 21 to Jan. 18 in his New York gallery. ""It's not a tourist view. She gets close to her subjects.""

But her favorite practitioner is someone less famous, the Czech photographer Josef Koudelka, noted for his work with the Magnum agency and high-contrast, black-and-white images, as in his seminal ""Gypsies"" series. ""I never use a flash or carry lights or anything,"" Ms. Lange said when we stopped for lunch and a beer in the town of Beaver Bay. A few people registered that a famous person was in their midst, but Ms. Lange was unfazed. ""I never crop,"" Ms. Lange added. ""I think it's a conceit. I always loved that Henri Cartier-Bresson showed you the whole image."" Ms. Lange reads up on photography -- she said she had been reading Roland Barthes's ""Camera Lucida"" that very week -- but her take on the medium is more instinctual than theoretical.

""When you're seeing through Jessica's lens, it's immediate and feels visceral,"" Ms. Paulson said. ""It's the same alchemy that makes her so extraordinarily powerful as an actress."" Anne Morin, whose company, diChroma Photography, produces traveling photography exhibitions, met Ms. Lange through Mr. Greenberg and became enough of a fan to send her work on tour. Ms. Lange can be ""as quick as Garry Winogrand,"" Ms. Morin said. It's true. When we arrived at Black Beach Park in Silver Bay -- so named for its tiny black stones -- Ms. Lange at first took a few pictures of moody Lake Superior, but she seemed uninspired by the landscape. Too generic. After we greeted a mother and two children who had braved the lake's cold water for a dip, her camera suddenly was up and she snapped several pictures of the family as they walked away, cloaked in towels. ""The boy turned as I was taking it, and it produced a great shape,"" she said.

At the University of Minnesota, photography accidentally ended up in her curriculum when she couldn't get into a painting class. She met a group of photographers through her professors there, including Daniel Seymour and Paco Grande. She married Mr. Grande in 1970, but not before ditching school to travel to Europe with them , including to Paris during the May 1968 protests. Once she moved to New York, she found herself living in a loft on the Bowery with Robert Frank (Mr. Seymour's collaborator in a 1972 documentary about the Rolling Stones on tour). She recalled Mr. Frank taking stills of her for a film she was working on at the time.

In the age of Instagram, when ""everyone is a photographer,"" as she put it, it's a treat for her to take control of the lens. It's a break from fretting that someone is taking her picture in a supermarket: ""I don't have to worry about being absurd."" Once we were heading back south to Duluth, I wondered, given her success as an actor, exactly how seriously she wanted to be taken as a photographer. ""You know how this works,"" she said, sounding not bitter but realistic. ""You're an actress, therefore you're not considered a photographer. So you're an actress who photographs. It's a kind of mindless categorizing; if you're one thing, you can't be another."" But Midwestern optimism, and what I gleaned was one of Ms. Lange's core personality traits -- what Ms. Paulson called her sense of ""freedom and abandon"" -- won the day, as the clouds actually parted for the return home. ""I've got a day job,"" she said, and laughed again. ""I just love taking photographs. That's the only reason I do it.""","With a new book of her photographs and a gallery show to follow, the two-time Oscar winner talks about her passion for being behind the camera.",8439dc6b-49bc-56c0-90d3-54b5edbcec3a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/29/arts/29jessica-lange6/29jessica-lange6-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=270870b7e4997002eb6fd35371ee420375d8fbf3b47448df1075be821b061086&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""What's wonderful is the anonymity of it,"" Ms. Lange says of switching sides from the object of the camera's gaze to the director of it.

Automobiles,Vintage VW Is Now a Wiener Wagon With All the Fixings,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/06/automobiles/vintage-vw-is-now-a-wiener-wagon-with-all-the-fixings.html,"BIRMINGHAM, Mich. -- His name is Bill Loizon, but everyone calls him Frank. For more than a decade, he has catered events from an old Volkswagen Pickup he turned into a mobile hot-dog stand -- Franks Anatra, he called it. A couple of years ago, the name of the wiener wagon had to be changed, by court order, and the business was grudgingly rechristened Franks Etc. Yet Bill's customers still call him Frank, and the red-hot catering and food truck business he operates with his wife, Mary Cay, has continued to grow. The enterprise is built, literally, on the back of a 1965 Volkswagen ""Dropside"" Pickup, a vehicle based on the automaker's original Transporter. The Pickup, with a bed that can be configured in a variety of ways, is well suited for on-the-move hot-dog sales. In an interview at the farmers market here in the northern Detroit suburbs, Mr. Loizon said he grew up in the food business, helping his mother run her fast-food business. He owned a Greek restaurant in downtown Detroit in the 1980s, but when that business failed he became an out-of-work food guy -- and an out-of-work car guy as well. The seeds of his automotive interests sprouted early, here in Birmingham. His boyhood home backed up to Woodward Avenue, a thoroughfare famous far from Michigan for its cruising scene and impromptu street races.

In a high school shop class, while other students made ashtrays and candleholders, he built a Volkswagen-based dune buggy with an aluminum beer keg for a gas tank and green plastic kitchen chairs for seating. That would be the first of several VWs and VW-like things he would own, including an early Microbus, a 1954 Beetle convertible and a Porsche Speedster replica built from a kit. After high school, Mr. Loizon put in time washing cars and doing odd jobs for a VW dealer, and it was there that he discovered the quirky yet practical Pickup. He knew it would be absolutely perfect for something, though at the time it wasn't exactly clear for what. A subsequent chance encounter with a 1940 Ford that had been converted to a barbecue grill provided a clue -- one that he would remember later. After the failure of his Greek restaurant, Mr. Loizon built a business selling souvenirs of the annual Woodward Dream Cruise, which attracts more than a million spectators each August. But he couldn't keep his mind off food, so he sold that enterprise and talked the owner of a home-improvement store into letting him open a hot-dog stand in the lobby. The stand, with a cooker and bun bin, was built on a pushcart. Its portability allowed Mr. Loizon to cater hot dogs at events throughout the area, as long as he had the energy to push the cart up on a trailer and haul it to the venue. He needed something that was easier to move, bigger and faster. Mr. Loizon eventually connected the dots and realized that serving hot dogs was a job for which the quirky Volkswagen Pickup was well qualified. After an Internet search, he found one in Los Angeles that had been fully restored. The price was $10,000, and within days it was his. Now that his hot-dog business had a home of sorts, it needed an identity. So when Mr. Loizon and an old pal stopped for lunch at a Woodward diner, they discussed possible names for the fledgling business.

After ""Frank N Stein"" was floated, then rejected, Mr. Loizon came up with an inspiration: ""Franks Anatra,"" he remembers saying. ""Anatra is the island nation where all my recipes come from."" So Franks Anatra was emblazoned on the flanks of the VW Pickup in big block letters. On his website, Mr. Loizon displayed pictures of the imaginary nation Anatra, and on the VW's door he painted the island's great seal. The entertaining mythology added a twist to the more obvious connotations of the name. The Pickup proved an ideal hot-dog stand, in part because the bed walls can be folded down flush against the vehicle's flanks -- hence the Dropside label these trucks acquired. Mr. Loizon installed chains on the ends of one bed wall so it would drop halfway, providing a counter. He had a two-burner propane cooker installed in the bed and later replaced it with a four-burner cooker. Propane and water tanks were mounted below the bed. ""The truck was made for this kind of thing,"" Mr. Loizon said. The Pickup was first manufactured in 1952 as a supplement to the Transporter line that had made its debut two years earlier. While the Pickup was purely practical, and proved popular in overseas markets, it didn't sell well in the United States and was a rare sight in the Detroit area. The truck's distinctiveness is a plus for an attention-seeking business. At open-air events like the farmers market, where Mr. Loizon has been a regular for years, shoppers stop to see the truck and end up buying lunch. Mr. Loizon said the vehicle's appeal had helped to create demand for the on-site hot-dog parties that he caters for corporate clients, including General Motors and the local NBC affiliate. The menu has expanded beyond hot dogs to include a variety of sausages. Mr. Loizon has taken good care of the pickup that has been so good to him. He had it fully restored in 2012 by a VW restoration specialist, John Bickel. This past winter, the truck was fitted with 4-wheel disc brakes, an air suspension and a 2-liter 4-cylinder boxer engine that generates more than 100 horsepower. (The stock 1.5-liter engine was rated at 44 horsepower.) That extra power comes in handy, because the VW tows a small camper trailer that serves as a soft-drink stand.",A Detroit-area man has turned an old Volkswagen Pickup into a mobile hot-dog stand.,8a351525-e0fb-5c51-aed7-3b17bacb9f72,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/06/automobiles/FRANKS1/FRANKS1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=429&w=600&s=86372dd6f37d977417ab769182d4ffd9a207d55a209e962bc8ca7cc8c4218896&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Bill Loizon and his wife, Mary Cay, with the 1965 VW Pickup that he converted into a food truck.",8a351525-e0fb-5c51-aed7-3b17bacb9f72,N24News/imgs/8a351525-e0fb-5c51-aed7-3b17bacb9f72.jpg,23

Sports,"Tiger Woods, Injured Grinder, Makes Cut at the Memorial",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/sports/golf/tiger-woods-memorial-tournament-score.html,"DUBLIN, Ohio -- When he was younger, Tiger Woods looked forward to getting older. ""Because I was getting better and better and better,"" he said Friday. Life is tricky. Woods, 44, no longer thinks so highly of the passage of time. ""Aging is not fun,"" he said. ""Now I'm just trying to hold on."" Well before dawn Friday, Woods awoke for his 8:17 a.m. tee time. The fused vertebrae in his surgically reconstructed back felt good and he was eager to build on his solid opening round on Thursday at the Memorial Tournament -- his first appearance on the PGA Tour since mid-February. Arriving at the Muirfield Village Golf Club, with a bright sun at his back that cast a glow across the practice range, Woods began to warm up with some carefree swings of a wedge. But in the progression to faster swings with more stress-inducing clubs, especially his woods, something went wrong.

His goal had been to loosen up, but in the tangled web of reshaped bone, scar tissue, musculature and arthritis that is now Woods's lower back, an opposite result unfolded. He felt more tight and his movements grew more restricted. Woods was asked Friday if that kind of double-cross happened very often. A follow-up question: ""So you never know exactly what you're going to have each day?"" Woods smiled broadly and replied: ""It's going to happen more times than not."" By the end of Friday's second round, Woods gingerly walked off the golf course having spent 18 holes wincing, flinching, limping and ardently pressing his hands against his lower back. With a round of 76 that left him three-over-par for the tournament, it appeared that the highly anticipated return of Woods was only going to last two days. But golf can be as fickle as a bad back. A host of golfers struggled Friday -- Bryson DeChambeau made a quintuple-bogey 10 on one hole -- and Woods survived the two-day cut of the field by one stroke. Woods finished Friday 12 strokes behind the second-round leaders Tony Finau and Ryan Palmer and hardly in contention. But as Woods said hours before the cut line was established: ""I would like to have the opportunity to play tomorrow.""

It was a gutsy proclamation after the discomfort Woods had clearly endured. Throughout the latter half of his round, Woods had difficulty making a full backswing on tee shots with a driver or a 3-wood, and when trying to unleash his typically powerful swipe at the ball, he was unable to hold the club with both hands. With his right hand coming off the club grip, he repeatedly hit weaker shots that faded to the right. Eventually, he seemed to start aiming to the left to compensate.

""It was a bit of struggle,"" he said, adding: ""I'm a lot older now, so things change, they evolve. You try to suck it up as best you can and get through it."" Woods's playing partner, Rory McIlroy, saw what was happening. ""Yeah, you could sort of tell when we made the turn, he hit a couple fairway wood shots off the tee that he sort of quit on,"" said McIlroy, the No. 1 ranked golfer on the tour. ""He wasn't quite moving as well."" During those holes, there was a post-swing scene that recurred for Woods: With a pained expression, he would watch a wayward tee shot land in deep rough, then sigh and softly mumble something to himself under his breath. McIlroy was asked if Woods said anything about his back troubling him. ""No, not really, I mean, you can tell -- he might make a bit of a grimace after a shot,"" McIlroy said. He continued: ""He's never been one to make excuses, right? So, no, he's never going to do that."" In the end, Woods gave himself a chance to make the cut by finding the resolve to shoot two-under par on his final three holes. On the par-5 seventh hole -- his 16th hole of the day because he began his round on the 10th tee -- Woods's spectacular recovery from a greenside bunker left a two-foot birdie putt. He then sank a 20-foot birdie putt on the 209-yard, par-3 eighth hole after an impressive tee shot to an elevated green.","Woods slogged through back pain to birdie two of his final three holes on Friday, surviving the cut by one stroke.",f859b4ee-0ebe-5aa1-aa30-2f63e0907c90,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/17/sports/17tiger-1/17tiger-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=c13091fac7968ae1df90637866995953bc30253a94f8aca4589178774702c276&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""It was a bit of struggle,"" Tiger Woods said of his second round at the Memorial Tournament.

Art & Design,Is That Yayoi Kusama Selfie Worth the Wait?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/arts/design/kusama-exhibit-dc.html,"WASHINGTON -- I had been waiting in line for one of the six dazzling mirrored rooms at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden's ""Yayoi Kusama: Infinity Mirrors"" exhibition for 15 minutes when I noticed the sign: ""How would you describe this room in three words?"" The show promises an immersive, transcendental experience in which viewers -- typically three at a time -- step inside mirrored rooms alternately covered with dangling lanterns and floating globes. We were among the 14,000 visitors trying to push through the exhibition of the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama's work in its opening week late last month. Like many others, we came with our phones out, seeking the perfect shot, depicting captivated bliss reflected thousands of times over. But instead: ""Keep it moving,"" guards yelled as visitors lingering in front of Ms. Kusama's canvases of hypnotic nets and dots. Visitors who had stood for hours in lines looping around the building discovered more of the same inside.

Some scrolled through their phones. A cry of outrage came from one woman in line, snugged against a wall with diminished cellphone service. ""I can't even get on Instagram,"" she wailed. ""Who here is by themselves?"" one attendant asked, and singles, realizing they could jump ahead, rushed to the front to join strangers.

Attendants announced artist-approved time limits in each space: 20 or 30 seconds for each group of three. By the time we had snapped a blurry selfie, we were shooed out. And then, of course, there was another line to rush into. ""We have to up our game,"" my friend said. The museum encouraged social media in the infinity rooms, using the hashtag #InfiniteKusama. So were we the only ones failing on that front?

Derek Debruce, 26, also came for the Instagram photo. ""I didn't get the shots that I wanted, but I got a little something-something,"" he said. Mr. Debruce, of Northern Virginia, became a member so he could skip the long lines outside. But he still found himself waiting in the gallery -- in lines so long that The Washington Post published a survival guide to the show. ""I thought the member pass would give me my privilege,"" said Linda Simplicio, another new member, laughing. ""But it hasn't."" As of Saturday, the museum had a record 170,000 visitors -- the highest attendance in 40 years for the period of Feb. 23 (the show's opening) through March 25. About a third of those people have toured the show. Melissa Chiu, the museum's director, said that although Ms. Kusama has been recognized throughout her career, ""it has only been in recent years that exhibitions have consistently broken museum attendance records and attracted enormous attention."" She credited social media for the increased interest.

Ms. Donnally, 61, and her husband, from Washington, were turned away from the show on their first try. On their second attempt, they arrived more than an hour before the museum opened at 10 a.m. They did not get all the way through ""Infinity Mirrors"" until 4 p.m. ""I hadn't realized it would take all day,"" Ms. Donnally said. Waiting in line for the last infinity room, my friend and I planned the perfect boomerang shot. Among dangling golden lanterns, we aimed the phone at mirrors reflecting a thousand jazz hands. We had 15 seconds left. ""Let's just look,"" she said, putting away her phone. Those last moments were the most entrancing. To accommodate the crowds, the museum has extended hours, from 10 a.m. until 8 p.m. on Wednesdays through May 3. And for the first time in its history, the museum also offers timed passes, which are available online a week in advance or given away at the museum for same-day visits, allowing the museum to reassess visitor limits every week, said Elizabeth Duggal, the museum's deputy director. Since opening week, the museum has reduced the number of daily visitors allowed inside to what Ms. Duggal called a ""sweet spot"" of about 1,600 to 1,700 people -- helping to improve the lines.",Long lines and big crowds to see this artist's show at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington make you wonder.,e3527740-5143-5a66-8619-cf5d9558e407,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/15/arts/15kusama-selfie/15kusama-selfie-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=d25210eb337ddda29afc9677aa31feda79360b50bc4165ff565c9cc71c2c1f36&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Zipporah Miles, Jolene Rencher and Alicia Simmons angling for the perfect shot at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden's ""Yayoi Kusama: Infinity Mirrors.""",e3527740-5143-5a66-8619-cf5d9558e407,N24News/imgs/e3527740-5143-5a66-8619-cf5d9558e407.jpg,14
Opinion,Think This Pandemic Is Bad? We Have Another Crisis Coming,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/opinion/sunday/climate-change-covid-economy.html,"On the last Friday in March, I lost hope.

I have always believed in America: not in our inherent goodness -- I am too black for that -- but in our sheer animal will to survive. Crisis after crisis, our country has evolved to meet the moment, even if that meant changing the way we thought the world worked or striving to upend the imbalance of power. But on that Friday, I was on my couch working when the messages started to pour in. Friends sent me video after video of Republican senators debating stimulus measures to address the coronavirus crisis, standing in the Senate chamber, saying that the Green New Deal -- a proposal that I helped create -- was the reason millions of Americans would not receive the help that they need.

I was furious. Of the nearly $2 trillion in aid proposed in that first version of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, known as the CARES Act, $500 billion went toward a business-relief fund with little to no oversight. Fifty-eight billion of this was earmarked for airlines, and a lax definition of eligible businesses created a loophole for oil and gas. The bill included no climate protections, so the claim that it was being held up over Green New Deal provisions was absurd. And the changes proposed by Democrats -- emissions reductions for airlines, limiting bailouts for fossil fuel industries, protections for airline workers -- were modest.

The senators I saw did not mention those things. Nor did they mention that the airlines had requested $50 billion after spending $45 billion on stock buybacks over the past five years. They did not mention that emissions reductions requested would not be required until 2025 or that when they were, the reductions would be less than 3 percent per year. And no one stood up and asked why corporations should be exempt from loan terms when the rest of us are not. Why is it ""opportunism"" when we try to design policy that would address more than one problem at a time, but it's ""efficiency"" when businesses do the same? (The final version of the CARES Act does not provide targeted funding for fossil fuels and reduced the aid for passenger airlines to $25 billion. None of the climate policies mentioned were included in the final version of the bill.)

Covid-19 and the economic collapse it has caused have laid bare how connected our problems are. Congress and the Federal Reserve are not going to lay out trillions of dollars, over and over, in perpetuity. Refusing to include measures related to climate and environmental justice in economic stimulus packages related to the coronavirus is not neutral when there is no guarantee of other opportunities to do so later. We need to design the stimulus not only to help the U.S. economy recover but to also become more resilient to the climate crisis, the next multitrillion-dollar crisis headed our way.",Addressing climate change is a big enough idea to revive the economy.,303b63aa-47bb-5c5b-9ef8-88a0548b145c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/09/opinion/sunday/15-inequality-climate_/15-inequality-climate_-facebookJumbo-v10.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=2e7cf43df4e899c7b85d67e8dadb82d102ba86e9e979582a216c00a03535f256&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A home in Baton Rouge, La., near an ExxonMobile oil refinery",303b63aa-47bb-5c5b-9ef8-88a0548b145c,N24News/imgs/303b63aa-47bb-5c5b-9ef8-88a0548b145c.jpg,11
Sports,N.F.L. Mock Draft 2020: Here's What the Experts' Picks Are,https://www.nytimes.com/article/nfl-mock-draft-predictions.html,"The N.F.L. draft, the league's biggest spectacle besides the Super Bowl, is a famously unpredictable affair that can humble even the most accurate forecasters. And yet, many football fans find mock drafts irresistible. Especially this year, when it's not as if you could be watching real sports instead. A team's draft selections are usually the culmination of countless hours spent scouting on the road, the strategies of coaches and the calculations of team executives -- a mix that produces surprises every year and draws millions of viewers. That coordination has been thrown out of whack this year, as coronavirus guidelines have forced team personnel to scout prospects without being able to travel or conduct in-person interviews. Mock drafts are always speculative, and their vast popularity suggests fans consume them the way they're intended: as jumping-off points for debates, rather than predictions you can take to the bank. According to The Huddle Report, which scores mock drafts after the real one takes place, last year's best forecasts nailed just 11 of the 32 first-round picks. It's largely guesswork meant for entertainment.

""Assuming the Redskins do not get a can't-refuse offer to trade back, they should jump at the chance to get this cornerstone talent for the team's defensive rebuild under defensive-minded Ron Rivera,"" Vinnie Iyer wrote of Young at The Sporting News. Other names often seen in the top 10 of mock drafts include Isaiah Simmons, a linebacker from Clemson; and Derrick Brown, a defensive tackle from Auburn. Wide receivers will fall out of the top 10. Many analysts consider the wide receiver crop to be among the deepest in years, led by Alabama's Jerry Jeudy and Henry Ruggs III, and Oklahoma's CeeDee Lamb. But the teams at the top of the draft are believed to have more pressing needs. The mock drafts largely have a rapid run on receivers beginning as early as the 11th pick by the New York Jets. Some receiver-needy teams with picks in the 20s, like the Philadelphia Eagles and the Minnesota Vikings, could move up to pass other teams that may select receivers, including the Las Vegas Raiders, San Francisco 49ers, Denver Broncos and Dallas Cowboys. But the sense that teams could find first-round talent at the receiving position in the second round has some forecasters suspecting teams could look to other positions early on. ""Sometimes the draft falls weird, and the incredible excess at receiver in this draft makes so many teams with wideout needs say they'll wait till the second and third rounds,"" Peter King wrote at NBC Sports. There won't be a running back taken early. There's no Ezekiel Elliott or Saquon Barkley in this draft. NFL.com's four mock drafters don't have a running back going before the Miami Dolphins' 26th pick; Georgia's D'Andre Swift, Wisconsin's Jonathan Taylor and Ohio State's J.K. Dobbins are considered the top candidates.","Though professional and armchair analysts probably won't get many picks correct, mock drafts sometimes consolidate around a few safe bets.",ae8a507b-dc0f-5319-a9a7-e4dc3e2e02e1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/22/multimedia/22xp-mockdraft/22xp-mockdraft-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Your top pick: Joe Burrow, the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback from Louisiana State University.",ae8a507b-dc0f-5319-a9a7-e4dc3e2e02e1,N24News/imgs/ae8a507b-dc0f-5319-a9a7-e4dc3e2e02e1.jpg,9
Television,CNN Arrest Is What Actual Censorship Looks Like,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/arts/television/cnn-arrest.html,"For days, President Trump has been on a rampage against Twitter for its treatment of him, and it's easy to see why. Early Friday morning, after a tweet from him about the violence in Minneapolis declared, ""When the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" Twitter dispatched police officers to the White House, who handcuffed Mr. Trump and took him into custody on live television in view of the entire nation. Oh, sorry, quick fact-check: That did not happen at all. The president remains free and tweeting. Twitter, a private company, remains free to set rules on the use of its service. The president's flagged tweets -- the ""shooting"" remark and a misleading attack on mail-in voting -- remain available to read, the first behind a notice that it violates the service's rules on glorifying violence, the second with a fact-checking link appended. The arrest on live TV Friday was of Omar Jimenez, a CNN reporter, and his crew, who were handcuffed and walked off down a ravaged Minneapolis block, where they'd been covering protests and violence after the killing of a black man, George Floyd, in police custody.

It looked like world news footage from a police state. Mr. Jimenez, wearing a mask in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, calmly negotiates with officers, visored and bunched in around the camera. He tells them they are live on the air, and he offers to get out of their way: ""Put us back where you want us."" He asks why and gets no answer. And he's walked off, to the stunned play-by-play of the anchors in the CNN studio. (Mr. Jimenez is black and Latino. Notably, given the racial dynamics of the Minneapolis protests, a white CNN reporter also covering the story said he was treated much more politely.) Then the producer is arrested, then the cameraman, until finally an officer picks up the camera and walks it off, the screen jostling into motion as if we, the audience, were being taken into custody, for getting too close, for seeing too much, for looking at someone the wrong way.

The official explanation for the arrest was that the CNN crew refused to move on police orders, an absurdity given what the world saw and heard live. ""I've never seen anything like this,"" the network anchor John Berman said. But we have seen things like this, not long ago, if not so flagrantly and shamelessly. Police in Ferguson, Mo., gave a similar rationalization in 2014 for arresting two journalists -- ordering one to ""Stop videotaping!"" as he recorded his arrest -- during the unrest after the police shooting of Michael Brown. In the past, though, the arrest did not happen to journalists who work for a news organization that the president had designated the ""enemy of the people."" It did not happen under a president who once retweeted a doctored video that showed him beating on a person with the CNN logo covering his face. And it did not happen in a week when that president threatened punitive measures against a private social-media platform for suggesting that the misinformation he tweeted was misinformation. The president, it seems, considers his inconvenience to be a violation of freedom, and actual press freedom to be an inconvenience. Which in the end is the only real connection between Mr. Trump's claims of oppression and the violation we watched on morning cable TV. Actual censorship happens when a government acts to suppress protected speech, not when a private company sets rules for using its platform.

Just hours before the arrest, Mr. Trump posted his tweet with the ""shooting"" line, which the Miami police chief Walter Headley used in 1967 to justify crackdowns on civil rights protesters. And for years, he has used his speech, copious and unfiltered, to argue that the police should have a free hand in dealing with threats, and that among the greatest threats are news outlets like CNN. By noon on Friday, the president was still freely grousing about Twitter, on Twitter. His account made no mention of the CNN arrests. That morning, Mr. Jimenez and his crew were released, with an apology from Minnesota's governor. But the messages had already been sent. The arrest told all media that there are people within law enforcement who now feel empowered enough to shut down coverage of unrest -- unrest resulting from police violence -- flat out in the open.

Style,Are Hippies the New Goths?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/style/hippies-manson-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-midsommar.html,"All smiles in their ribbon-and-lace-trimmed mini-dresses, the three winsome young women could not have been more eye-catching. That they were members of the Manson clan, photographed, hair swinging, on their way to court, is chilling of course. But fashion, perversely, cannot look away.

Like the culture at large, the style world has been fixated of late on these and other profoundly unsettling representations of the 1960s counterculture, designers and marketers viscerally drawn to hippiedom's sketchily improvised manner and style, intent, it would seem, on exploring its dark side.

Indeed, there's a lot to suggest that, to some minds at least, hippies are fashion's new Goths.

Sports,The Bridge Between Michael Jordan and LeBron James: Kobe Bryant,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/sports/lebron-kobe.html,"LOS ANGELES -- Late Saturday night, after he had passed Kobe Bryant for third place on the N.B.A.'s career scoring list, LeBron James got a phone call from Bryant, who had already tweeted his congratulations but wanted to reach out anyway. For two iconic figures who had mastered their craft in the shadow of Michael Jordan, their conversation was warm and celebratory. Between them, there was mutual respect and admiration, a friendship that had grown stronger in recent years. James had paid tribute to Bryant during the Lakers' loss to the Philadelphia 76ers that night by writing the phrase ""Mamba 4 Life"" on his sneakers, a reference to Bryant's self-styled nickname. James reflected on their relationship afterward. ""It's surreal,"" he told reporters. ""It doesn't make no sense, but the universe just puts things in your life."" The next day, Bryant and eight others, including his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, died in a helicopter crash near Los Angeles. It brought to an abrupt end a friendship between icons, Bryant and James, who have each dominated the N.B.A. as the apparent heirs of Jordan, channeling his drive and talent and championship pedigree to become distinctive greats with legacies of their own.

At 41, Bryant was just six years older than James -- but Bryant came from a different generation, from an era that overlapped with the late stages of Jordan's career. In that sense, Bryant was the bridge that linked Jordan to James, who entered the N.B.A. the season after Jordan retired but has always worn the No. 23 as homage to him. As a teenage prodigy, James sought to emulate Bryant from a distance: his preparation, his approach and, perhaps above all, his supreme confidence. James was still in high school when Bryant, then one of the N.B.A.'s youngest stars, spoke at an ABCD Basketball Camp for elite prospects. Bryant emphasized the value of hard work. ""I was just listening,"" James told reporters last week. ""I was just trying to soak everything up that I could.""

As a high school junior, James met Bryant for the first time. It was February 2002, and James had a game outside of Philadelphia, which happened to be the site of N.B.A. All-Star weekend. James and one of his friends went to an InterContinental Hotel so they could chat with Bryant for a few minutes. Bryant presented James with a pair of his sneakers. They were size 14 -- one size too small -- but James said he ""rocked them"" in his game that night anyway. James also mimicked Bryant's path to stardom, jumping straight to the N.B.A. out of high school. Bryant's success, James said, had helped embolden him to do the same. When Bryant had made the leap in 1996, most teams were reluctant to draft a high school player, and Bryant slipped to No. 13. By the time James entered his name in the draft in 2003, the league had no such qualms, due in no small measure to Bryant. James went No. 1 over all to the Cleveland Cavaliers. A few years later, James had a formative experience alongside Bryant as a member of the United States men's basketball team. During the summer of 2007, the team gathered in Las Vegas for an Olympic qualifying game. Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim, one of the team's assistants, recalled that Bryant showed up a day early to work out on his own. He proceeded to treat practice the following day like it was Game 7 of the N.B.A. finals. ""He was going after people,"" Boeheim said in a telephone interview on Monday, ""and LeBron and all these younger guys were looking around like, 'What's he doing?' I don't think it gets talked about a lot, but I think he made a difference in how they approached the game. LeBron was not a great defensive player in those days, and Kobe had a huge influence on him.""

At the time, James was just 22 and still considered by most to be a ""young phenom,"" Michael Redd, one of the more experienced players on that national team roster, said in a telephone interview on Monday. But it was clear to teammates that James was absorbing lessons from Bryant, big and small, that he was watching the way Bryant went about his business, especially on defense. ""I think LeBron had a tremendous amount of respect for Kobe at that time,"" Redd said. ""And Kobe did, too, for LeBron.""

In group play of its qualifying tournament, the United States built an enormous lead against Venezuela. But late in the second half, Bryant was still playing full-court defense against Greivis Vasquez, Venezuela's point guard. Bryant picked up a couple of steals before going to the bench, where Boeheim reminded him that the win was in hand. ""I said, 'Kobe, we're up 49,'"" Boeheim recalled. ""And he goes: 'That don't matter. I'm getting him, coach.'"" The United States went on to win a gold medal at the Beijing Games, and Bryant played again in 2012 during the team's gold-medal run in London. By then, Bryant was one of the roster's elder statesmen, a five-time N.B.A. champion who was content to take on more of a mentorship role. But the fire was still there. ""Kobe's leadership and fierce determination is unmatched by anyone I've ever seen,"" Boeheim said. ""I think Jordan was that way. I didn't get to coach him, but I saw him, and I think he was the same way. Every day, every practice, he's going full out."" As opponents, Bryant and James were hypercompetitive. But as Bryant neared retirement, their relationship seemed to become more close-knit. Both men had won championships. Both had built legacies that were secure. Both, like Jordan before them, had signature-sneaker deals with Nike. Both were businessmen with growing off-court ambitions, and both were raising young daughters. After Bryant stepped away from the game for good in 2016 and James signed with the Lakers two years later, the connection between them grew stronger. In the curiously intense world of Lakers fandom, some of the team's most ardent supporters -- so-called Kobe stans to the core -- were outraged that James, a player who they felt had hopscotched from team to team, would be wearing purple and gold. But Bryant, who had spent his entire 20-year career with the Lakers, expressed support for James from the very start. It was as if the high priest of the Lakers church were offering the sacrament to the team's newest marquee star, and it went a long way toward softening some fans' hard feelings.","Bryant became the new giant after Jordan and then passed the torch to James, who developed a special bond with the retired Lakers star.",c748f0b7-1ccc-5c09-a511-c124dfe931e8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/28/sports/28KOBE-LEBRON-1/28KOBE-LEBRON-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=1256022d8be4e43a04f4284dd6554c9bf4c3c49e96cfd06afa57b5f1ef7f74aa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"LeBron James, left, and Kobe Bryant were friends and the apparent heirs to Michael Jordan's throne.",c748f0b7-1ccc-5c09-a511-c124dfe931e8,N24News/imgs/c748f0b7-1ccc-5c09-a511-c124dfe931e8.jpg,9
Science,"Some Meteorites Are Million-Dollar Finds, Others Are 'Meteorwrongs'",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/science/some-meteorites-are-million-dollar-finds-others-are-meteorwrongs.html,"This polished sphere was fashioned from a meteorite that crash-landed into a dry riverbed in Russia. On Wednesday it soared again, not through space but at an auction house, snagging $130,000 -- nine times its asking price. The meteorite was a part of a cosmic collection put up for sale at Christie's in London. But it was one of only a few space rocks to take off. The meteorite encrusted in extraterrestrial gemstones, given a high valuation of $1.1 million, did not sell. Neither did some of the other heavy hitters such as the $639,000 Martian meteorite, a $426,600 chunk of the Chelyabinsk fireball that exploded over Russia in 2013 nor the $355,500 rock that looks like a metallic screaming face.

James Hyslop, Christie's specialist in science and natural history, said in a video accompanying the auction that he priced meteorites based on their size, where they came from, their scientific importance and the story behind their discovery. Fragments that were once part of the moon or Mars are of particular value, he said.

In an email after the auction, Mr. Hyslop offered his reasons for why some items sold and some didn't. ""We saw in the sale that lots with lower estimates sparked particularly competitive bidding and sold well,"" he said. He added that the size and weight of the more expensive meteorites might have made them somewhat less accessible than the smaller, less expensive lots, which may be why many did not find buyers. But before you go hunting for the next million-dollar meteorite, know that it's rare to unearth a space rock. In fact, most of the things that people think are meteorites are not meteorites at all. Many are ""meteorwrongs"": chunks of rock and metal that masquerade as meteorites.

Just ask Randy Korotev, a lunar geochemist from Washington University in St. Louis, who has come across countless cases of mistaken identity while studying moon rocks. Or better yet, don't ask Dr. Korotev, as his email has been clogged with meteorite identification requests for more than a decade. Since 2006 he has received nearly 18,000 emails from people asking him whether they have found a space rock, including more than 1,280 requests so far in 2016. ""It's becoming overwhelming,"" Dr. Korotev said. ""I spend several hours every week answering email."" Only about one in every 1,000 finds turns out to be an actual meteorite, he said. Most of the ""meteorwrongs"" are actually masses of iron, glassy byproducts from smelting ore called slags, or igneous rocks with small cavities called vesicular rocks. But he has also come across musket balls, grinding balls and bowling balls. Dr. Korotev's personal website now carries a disclaimer for people who think they have found a meteorite that could make them rich. His advice: Turn to his self-test checklist and meteorite realities list before pressing send on that email.","A meteorite found in Russia fetched a big price at auction, but most ""space rocks"" turn out to be just rocks.",e959f6bd-533a-5cee-925c-d4ad1808b3f3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/21/science/21auction/21auction-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=3f9f0efb0828ba72ba6c69ef62d6a87fa1ebd2c5330dfeead988be7093e4d997&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A sphere made of a Seymchan meteorite that was ground and polished to show its olivine crystals, sold for about $130,000 at auction.",e959f6bd-533a-5cee-925c-d4ad1808b3f3,N24News/imgs/e959f6bd-533a-5cee-925c-d4ad1808b3f3.jpg,2

Style,What Does Being Best Dressed Mean?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/16/style/International-best-dressed-list-goodbye.html,"This weekend, the International Best-Dressed List was released -- its 79th iteration, but the first under its new caretaker, Air Mail, the Graydon Carter newsletter/zine. Did you notice? Once upon a time the crowning of a new set of style royalty was so newsworthy that reporters from The Rocky Mountain News to The Daily Mail in England would vie for the scoop. And yet this year, the announcement that Cate Blanchett and Roger Federer had taken top honors, that Janelle Monae, Zoe Kravitz, LeBron James and Zac Posen (among others -- 30 in all, from 16 countries) had also been recognized, feels more anticlimactic than edge-of-the-seat anticipatory. Despite our seeming unending appetite for ""best of"" lists (which this year has taken an even more extreme turn thanks to the end of the decade), all of them apparently read and pored over and shared until they trend on a variety of metrics, are we, actually, over the best-dressed list? The one that was among the first of them all? I am beginning to think the answer is yes. In our fractured world, where the individual has become ascendant and the digital sphere has elevated the obscure to the influential, where trends have devolved into everything you want all the time, and formality has become a choice rather than a professional diktat, the idea of an unnamed group of people ruling on who is ""best dressed"" seems increasingly as anachronistic as ""no white after Labor Day."" (Tell that to Nancy Pelosi.)

""Best dressed"" has become an empty term. This is a time of ""viral dress"" and ""influential dress,"" ideas that often have little do with the subjective value judgment attached to the word ""best,"" and which are measurable in some objective way. But ""best,"" with all its implications of a certain elite and ineffable -- what? style, good taste, elegance? -- seems tied to another era, one in which a small group acted as gatekeepers of power, not to mention of social and cultural capital. It is an era chronicled extensively in a book by Amy Fine Collins, a journalist who is herself in the Best-Dressed Hall of Fame, published earlier this fall by Rizzoli (and who is part of the governing body of the current International Best-Dressed List). Though it is not the first book about the list -- in 2004, Eleanor Lambert, the founder of the list, was a co-author of ""Ultimate Style: The Best of the Best-Dressed List"" -- it is the most comprehensive.

Founded in 1940 by Ms. Lambert, a publicist, as a scheme to draw attention to the American fashion industry, the best-dressed list aimed to celebrate both individual style and those who invested in a more classic elegance: the looks of singularities like Diana Vreeland and China Chow, as well as famous designer champions like C.Z. Guest and the Duchess of Windsor. They were women (and latterly men) who went to the sort of events that were often photographed, thus putting them in a position to influence other people's choices. It has changed with the times, no question. Attempted to stay current. Diversified. Youthquaked. Celebrated celebrities who became style setters when, as Ms. Fine Collins said in an interview over tea at the Carlyle, ""the fashion and entertainment industries began to converge.""

As you go through the decades, you see figures emerge on the list as they emerged on the pop culture scene: Mary Tyler Moore, Diahann Carroll, Mikhail Baryshnikov. The list tried to fight against some of the worst evolutions in fashion. In 2003, after Ms. Lambert retired and ""bequeathed"" her invention to four editors -- Mr. Carter, Ms. Fine Collins, Reinaldo Herrera and Aimee Bell -- it moved, with some fanfare, to Vanity Fair. At the time, Ms. Bell told The Times, ""Those who are dressed by stylists are banned from the list."" (That notion obviously didn't last long, since it would have taken every celeb off the table, which was not a tenable proposition for the magazine.) But as much as it has changed and been, as Ms. Fine Collins said, ""elastic and flexible and able to adapt to what is happening in the zeitgeist,"" it has also relied largely on certain commonalities: access, privilege, the ability to go out a lot. Even as it became more diverse, it became more diverse within certain very limited paradigms, chief among them fame and money. And it has spawned an entire sector.

We can thank the International Best-Dressed List for Mr. Blackwell's Worst-Dressed list, founded in 1964. For the fact that almost every magazine now has its own best-dressed list, including People (Best-Dressed Stars), GQ (Best-Dressed Men) and Sports Illustrated (Best-Dressed Athletes). For Vogue one-upping them all with Best-Dressed of the Week and for Vanity Fair further clouding the issue by continuing to curate its own best-dressed list even after Mr. Carter, Ms. Fine Collins and Ms. Bell left in 2017 and 2018, Ms. Lambert's list in hand. For the Oscars and the Met gala getting their own best- and worst-dressed lists -- multiple versions. For Roger Stone, the clotheshorse and political operative convicted of witness tampering and lying to Congress, creating his own: Mr. Stone's Best and Worst Dressed List (presumably not anymore). For the fact that there is now a best-dressed list for pretty much anyone's liking. Indeed, if I were making a list, it would include, say, the women in white at the State of the Union. The woman in Sudan (also in white). The yellow vests. Billy Porter in a dress at the Oscars. Lizzo with her little bag. In other words, the moments in fashion this year when dress became a symbol of social and political change. But that's me. You try! (It's both a fun and difficult exercise.) And though the caretakers of the International List claim theirs is the only true list, since it was the first, there's nothing that says primogeniture equals ownership in this particular case. Which is why, though the book was conceived in part as an argument that said list -- the original one, with past and pedigree -- can be seen as a mirror held up to society, a history in chiffon and silk, it functions less as a case for the list's continued relevance than as a very well-accessorized memorial. That's why the unveiling of the latest iteration of the list seems like the echo of a coda to a symphony heard long ago.

After all, if there is one truism of today it is that everyone can take pictures of themselves in their bedrooms (or on the street or outside a space they may not actually have access to) and have their photos reach a million people -- thus, potentially, changing how others dress. And those people don't need the approval of the insiders to do it. In fact, the lack of approval of insiders is part of their appeal.

Theater,Review: 'A Small Oak Tree Runs Red' Unties a Century-Old Noose,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/theater/review-a-small-oak-tree-runs-red.html,"In rural Georgia, 100 years ago this spring, Mary Turner, eight months pregnant, made what a newspaper called ""unwise remarks"" about the lynching of her husband. So a mob came for her, too. They tied her by the ankles. They hung her upside down from a tree. They doused her dress with gasoline and lit a match. That wasn't the worst.

As a reporter for The Crisis, a magazine published by the NAACP, wrote, while Turner writhed, a man took a hog-butchering knife and cut the baby out of her belly. ""The infant, prematurely born, gave two feeble cries and then its head was crushed by a member of the mob with his heel,"" the article says.

I didn't know this particular story before I saw ""A Small Oak Tree Runs Red,"" written by Lekethia Dalcoe and directed by Harry Lennix at the Billie Holiday Theater.

Travel,New Cruise Ships to Set Sail for Antarctica,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/travel/antarctica-cruises.html,"As the number of travelers cruising Antarctica swells, polar expedition companies are launching sustainable vessels designed for these bucket-list trips. According to the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators, approximately 56,000 tourists visited Antarctica in the 2018-2019 season, a 53 percent increase from the 2014-2015 season. ""Climate change is a chief reason for the increased interest in visiting Antarctica,"" said Mary Curry, a small ship cruise specialist and travel planner at Adventure Life. ""We truly don't know if the region will ever be as magnificent as it is now."" ""Antarctica itineraries often sell out one or two years in advance, so travelers should be prepared to book early,"" she advised.

Interested in seeing the southernmost continent? Here's a roundup of some of the tour operators planning itineraries for this year and next. In November, Antarctica21 debuted the world's first vessel purpose-built for Antarctic tourism: the 73-passenger Magellan Explorer, equipped with ice-detecting radar technology, a heat recycling system and a fleet of 10 Zodiac boats. A forward-facing observation deck and glass-enclosed lounge offer prime wildlife viewing, while designer guest rooms feature balconies and single cabins. Most itineraries, including the 8-day Classic Antarctica Air-Cruise, bypass the turbulent waters of the Drake Passage by flying from Punta Arenas to King George Island. From there, travelers cruise the South Shetland Islands and west coast of Antarctica to spot penguins, whales and other marine wildlife. Full board rates begin at $13,995 per person and include Antarctic flights and activities.

""We want to take conscious travelers closer to nature with a footprint we're proud of,"" said Daniel Skjeldam, the company's chief executive. The MS Fridtjof Nansen's Highlights of the Frozen Continent, a 12-day journey, explores some 20 sites across the Antarctic Peninsula, where guests can take a polar plunge and enter a lottery to camp overnight on the ice. Prices start at $7,875 per person with eight sailings from November 2020 to January 2021. In April, Lindblad Expeditions' new National Geographic Endurance vessel will hit the seas featuring 69 cabins, a science command center and a PC5 ice class -- it's the strongest ice-breaking expedition ship of its kind based on an international rating system for polar vessels. Additional amenities include two observation ""igloos,"" a spa with infinity Jacuzzis and a permanent polar art installation. The new 35-day Epic Antarctica voyage traverses the Antarctic Peninsula, the 200-foot Ross Ice Shelf and UNESCO sites on Australia and New Zealand's sub-Antarctic islands. Guests travel with a crew of veteran naturalists, a certified photo instructor, and an undersea specialist equipped with a hydrophone and underwater video camera. ""Travelers will encounter almost every imaginable form of ice and observe endemic species found nowhere else on earth,"" said Trey Byus, the company's chief expedition officer. All-inclusive rates from $48,800 with departures on December 27, 2021 and January 26, 2022. Astronomy buffs should keep their eyes on the 93-cabin Ocean Victory, launching this December. The travel outfitter Adventure Life is taking guests to witness next year's total solar eclipse on Dec. 4 at a prime position just east of South Orkney Island.

Media,Netflix Reports a Subscriber Bump as Disney Poses a New Threat,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/21/business/media/netflix-q4-2019-earnings-nflx.html,"Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, has grown used to going up against Amazon, Hulu and YouTube. But the Walt Disney Company's entry into the streaming industry, with Disney Plus, caught his attention. After Netflix released its earnings figures for the fourth quarter of 2019 on Tuesday, Mr. Hastings noted his new rival's ""great"" content lineup, including ""The Mandalorian,"" a ""Star Wars"" series featuring the character known as Baby Yoda. And in a rare acknowledgment of a competitor's strength, he added that the emergence of Disney in streaming ""takes away a little from us."" Disney Plus started strong in November, signing up 10 million customers on its first day, and industry insiders wondered how much Disney might have dinged Netflix. Turns out, a little bit, according to Netflix's latest results. The streaming giant signed up 420,000 new customers in the United States during the last three months of 2019, the company reported. That fell shy of the 600,000 it had expected.

Netflix misses its estimates about half the time, but the company suggested that, for this quarter, Disney Plus might have had a moderate impact. But in Mr. Hastings's view, Disney is more of a threat to traditional television. ""Most of their growth in the future is coming out of linear TV,"" he said in a call with investors after the earnings announcement. Netflix now has 61 million customers across the country.Its slowing growth in the United States is nothing new. The service is still the dominant streaming company in the nation and expects to top out at 90 million total domestic customers.

Internationally, the results were more impressive. Netflix added about 8.4 million subscribers outside the United States in the last quarter, exceeding the seven million it had anticipated. Record additions in Latin America, Asia and Europe have given the company a total of 167.1 million subscribers around the world, a 5.5 percent bump from the end of September. Netflix's stock rose more than 2 percent in after-hours trading following its fourth-quarter earnings report.

The new subscriptions abroad underscored Netflix's status as a largely international business, putting it in a good position to counter the pending arrival of domestic streaming entrants like NBCUniversal's Peacock (April) and AT&T's HBO Max (May). About 90 percent of Netflix's new business comes from outside the United States, and Mr. Hastings spends more of his time managing its overseas strategy than on domestic content.

* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The company on Tuesday also reported a significant change in how it counts viewership. Netflix used to tally accounts that watched at least 70 percent of a show or film to generate its version of a ratings figure. Now, it will consider a ""view"" to be any account that has watched at least two minutes of a series or a film. Some Hollywood players have expressed frustration with the meager viewership data provided by Netflix. Nielsen, a third-party research firm, provides ratings but only to clients, such as producers and studios. In its latest report, Netflix played up some of its new programming, including ""The Witcher,"" a fantasy epic starring Henry Cavill. The company said it had been viewed by 76 million households within four weeks of its release under the new measurement system. But the new system inflates viewership data by as much as 35 percent, according to the company. Netflix said the new method was fair because it treated short and long pieces of content equally. The new count reveals a viewer's ""requests,"" the company said, akin to the ""most popular"" section of a news site. Netflix anticipates adding seven million total customers for the first three months of 2020, down from the 9.6 million it added in the same period last year. That has partly to do with the competitive landscape and a price increase Netflix instituted last year. The company's balance sheet is also improving. For the current year Netflix anticipates it will have to spend $2.5 billion more in cash than it takes in -- a financial metric known as cash flow -- which would be an improvement over last year, when it burned through more than $3 billion.","The streaming giant behind ""The Crown"" and ""The Irishman"" now has more than 167 million subscribers around the world.",7ba85a5e-bcd6-51c3-b68c-c62b3766f744,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/21/business/21NETFLIX-witcher/21NETFLIX-witcher-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=0d9f1003516531b78d4cd745e6fb60ebe867489b5243d6b1f0041c39780a1dc0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Henry Cavill in a new Netflix series, ""The Witcher.""",7ba85a5e-bcd6-51c3-b68c-c62b3766f744,N24News/imgs/7ba85a5e-bcd6-51c3-b68c-c62b3766f744.jpg,16
Travel,"In Tucson, an Unsung Architectural Oasis",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/travel/in-tucson-an-unsung-architectural-oasis.html,"Credit...John Burcham for The New York Times



""People tend to come to Tucson to figure something out,"" Demion Clinco remarked one cool desert evening, beneath a sky so boundless it made all things seem possible. We were seated on the terrace of the 85-year-old Arizona Inn, drinking anachronistic cocktails. The cocktails produced an optimism of their own. Pulling on his bourbon old-fashioned, Mr. Clinco, a native Tucsonan and former member of the state House of Representatives, added a fillip, ""When they do, they tend to leave."" That I had come to Tucson to figure something out was evident. It remained to be seen precisely what. I arrived -- as snowbirds have for much of the state's recent history -- fleeing a bitter and prolonged East Coast winter, a season during which the blackened mounds of ice blocking city streets and crosswalks, when they finally melted, left behind a tideline of crud. Somehow that trash felt metaphoric. The varied detritus of urban living also clusters in your psyche: small angers, embedded resentments, everyday slights, the guy looking cross-eyed at you on the E train. Like street trash, this stuff is hard to recycle; I needed, as we all occasionally do, to flee the bedeviling daily issues and light out.

Escape is what led me to Tucson, a fact unlikely to bring joy to the hearts of its civic boosters, who would perhaps prefer visitors to focus on the positive aspects of this midsize Southwestern city. I am, assuredly, mindful of those -- aware that Tucson is well situated in a valley basin geologically lofted to an altitude (2,600 feet) that in my mind qualifies it as high desert; that its signal feature is a series of jagged mountain ranges enclosing its flanks like a palisade; that its extravagant skies, particularly at twilight, have a way of vaulting the spirits in a manner I have seldom experienced anyplace else besides Rome. Tucson is no Rome, however. It is a dusty outpost on the fringes of the Sonoran Desert, a cyclical boomtown that suffered badly in the financial crash of 2008 and that, even beforehand, had in many ways seen better days. It is a grid city of long avenues and abundant strip malls; a place whose largest employers are a university, the military, the government and a maker of missile systems. It is a mini-metropolis whose proximity to the Mexican border has resulted not only in a shadow economy but also some fairly stark racial and economic bifurcations. It is a blue dot in a red state, a college town whose seasonal population of students and retirees departs this month in a mass migration that leaves tumbleweed vacancies in its wake. It is also a city whose loopy retail landscape skews heavily toward yoga studios, thrift shops and vape stores. And one of the city's better-kept secrets is how often these places occupy structures that could easily be counted among the more significant examples of mid-20th century architecture in the country. That is, if anyone were bothering to look. I had first taken note of this curiosity some years back when attending the annual American Gem Trade Association fair in Tucson. In reality one central fair and an agglomeration of 40 or so satellites, where dealers trade in the countless minerals of which the earth is formed (and also a certain amount of random space flotsam), the fair is the place to be if you are ever in the market for an eight-carat Mozambique ruby, a Brazilian rock crystal carved like a phallus or a fragment of a meteorite.

I reflect on how deeply I enjoy the ramshackle dispersion of the city and on the fact that I now know which Mexican handicrafts store to visit if I am ever in need of a six-foot ceramic pineapple from Michoacan. I think about a photo gallery I like as much for its location near a funky tattoo parlor as for its adventurous exhibitions, a diner in a movie-ready structure unaltered since the 1960s, and the thrift shops of which Tucson boasts more than it has hipster brunch spots. I recall, too, the pleasures of ordering a heaping platter of huevos rancheros at my favorite hipster brunch spot, the Five Points Market, situated on an intersection whose other notable landmarks include a florist selling $1 roses and a used-car dealership with the motto ""Ugly but Honest."" By the time Clyde Wanslee came up with that memorable slogan in the 1930s, the old pioneer town of Tucson had already entered a period of unprecedented expansion. Figures compiled by the Tucson Historic Preservation Foundation peg Tucson's 1940 population at 35,000, a figure that by 1960 had soared to 212,000. While it's not surprising that housing starts flourished along with a rapidly growing city, what strikes a visitor now is how little the accompanying boom owed to structural archetypes then dominating postwar development back East. While builders on the Eastern Seaboard assembled cookie-cutter colonials by the thousands, Tucson developers instead adapted the austerities of International Style Modernism to their city's magnificent though challenging terrain. Some preservationists claim Tucson possesses some of the densest concentrations of midcentury Modernist architecture in the Southwest, reluctantly conceding that the finest examples are not nearly as easy to find as similar ones clustered throughout entire midcentury neighborhoods in Phoenix, just two hours away. Even Mr. Clinco -- who was instrumental in resuscitating the drowsy Tucson Historic Preservation Foundation in 2008 -- grants that about the only way to eyeball prime Modernist gems by architects like Tom Gist, Anne Rysdale, Robert Swaim or Arthur T. Brown that lie scattered in the foothills or secluded in stands of saguaro is on one of the guided tours his group conducts every autumn during its Tucson Modernism Week. Yet they're quick to note that plenty of astonishingly individualistic architecture lies scattered throughout the city. All that is needed to find them are wheels and a map.

To guide me I used a slick, informative foldout called ""Broadway: Born Modern,"" which is one in a series of fine guides the preservationist group has produced to find Tucson's varied wonders, from its bars and drive-ins to its houses of worship, and also the city's abundant neon signage (Dirk J. Arnold's ""Gateway Saguaro"" on the Miracle Mile being perhaps the most emblematic example). The specific focus of ""Broadway: Born Modern"" is a checkerboard assortment of midcentury holdouts still standing lonely but proud amid the big-box stores and stucco strip malls on a stretch of Broadway from Euclid Avenue to Country Club Road. Here, on the two-mile Sunshine Mile -- linking what was once the city's suburban eastern reaches to its historic downtown -- desert Modernists evolved a quirky utilitarian vernacular all their own. Cantilevered roofs canopy glass curtain walls, shading them from the harsh summer sun. Blank fieldstone walls form the facades of cool interior caves. Soaring organic shapes vault sculpturally from the sere landscape like the ramparts of a cathedral consecrated to some wacko progressive religion. One such structure, created in 1971 by Bernard Friedman and John Whitmire of Friedman and Jobusch Architects, stands sentry at a corner of Broadway and Country Club Road. Directly opposite it on Broadway is the historic Broadway Village, a gentle ensemble of brick hacienda-style structures designed in the 1930s by the Swiss-born Josias Joesler, arguably Tucson's most celebrated architect. In the contrast between the two can be traced a shift in a city's ambitions and a radical progression away from Tucson's pueblo past toward an undefined future in the space age. The more recent of the two is a stark white, cast-concrete building set back from a broad plaza ornamented with a large sculptural amoeba; it has a high columned overhang, a soaring glazed expressionist frieze to bring in light and overall an air of unassailable exuberance.

I feel expansive making an A.T.M. withdrawal. And ""expansiveness and optimism,"" as Andie Zelnio, of the Tucson Historic Preservation Foundation, once told me, are signal characteristics of 20th-century boomtowns of the American West. ""Partly what attracted many of us to the West in the first place is that sense of space and possibility,"" said Ms. Zelnio, an Illinois native and architect who lived in New York and Los Angeles before relocating to Tucson permanently in 2004. Add to that an unfettered ability to think and design in novel ways, as many architects did when faced with a landscape both wondrous and seemingly inhospitable. The results of their experiments stud Broadway for most of its length, delightful and largely unremarked. Among my favorites are Ms. Rysdale's elegantly restrained geometric Haas Building of 1957; Juan Worner y Bas's quirky 1961 Murphey Building, with its scalloped parapet and terra-cotta statues of philosophers and saints; the adobe brick Broadmoor Medical Center; and the classic open-front facade Mr. Friedman designed in 1954 to house Hirsh's Shoes. ""In 1954 we stood alone,"" read a tagline in an advertisement for Hirsh's Shoes I came across in a program printed to accompany Tucson Modernism Week. ""Sixty years later, we still stand alone."" Happily for Hirsh's Shoes and other imperiled local landmarks, that is not altogether the case. Since being restarted, the Tucson Historic Preservation Foundation has committed passionately to identifying, recording and conserving unsung local treasures, from a historic courtyard motel to a refined and much degraded center city park by the landscape architect Garrett Eckbo. ""The first thing people want to know when they come here is, 'Where is the historic area?' That's what they want to see,"" said Hannah Glasston, a preservationist and director of the estimable Etherton Gallery, whose inventory includes both contemporary photography and vintage works by photographers as disparate as Weegee, Edward Sheriff Curtis and Ansel Adams. When she first came to Tucson from upstate New York to attend college in the 1970s, ""I was attracted to obvious historic buildings,"" Ms. Glasston said, referring to guidebook destinations like the Cathedral of St. Augustine, a stupefying encrusted monument to the Mexican Baroque. ""But then I started to see stuff that made me think, 'What are these things?' "" Once her eye adjusted to the determined quiddities of her adopted hometown, she said, ""Even weird cinder-block strange things from the 1950s started to look fabulous.""

Though on recent trips I've made it a modest goal to seek out some of Tucson's more oddball Modernist structures, I tend to lodge at one of its gentler traditional ones. Built in 1930 by Isabella Greenway, Arizona's first congresswoman and a lifelong friend of Eleanor Roosevelt, the Arizona Inn was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 and is now run by Will Conroy, Ms. Greenway's grandson. Like much of the city, the Arizona Inn was hit hard by the 2008 crash, which obliged Mr. Conroy to lay off more than a third of his staff. Despite that, this unlikely hotelier (a Brooklyn-born screenwriter, he is the son of the novelist Frank Conroy) has somehow found the means and contrived a way to preserve the civilizing dimensions of this 14-acre oasis, with its manicured lawns, walled patios, book-filled guest rooms, beds of heirloom roses and an overall air of assiduously maintained gentility. Dirk J. Arnold's ""Gateway Saguaro,"" on the Miracle Mile is among the neon signage in the city. John Burcham for The New York Times Whether most contemporary visitors find time to use the folding card tables tucked into each commodious guest room closet, their presence conjures up an era when people arrived at the inn by rail each winter, their trunks filled with the many costume changes required for daily rubbers of bridge, croquet matches or afternoon teas. With little to impinge on the fantasy of living like Gary and Rocky Cooper or the East Coast swells who routinely lodged at the Inn, I slow down there and fall into lazy routine. Yet while most guests tend to venture only rarely from the hotel's seductive confines, I head out routinely on daily excursions to check out an eccentric city I've increasingly come to love. I get my daily breakfast of poached eggs and bacon at Chaffin's Family Restaurant -- little changed except in name since it was erected in the Googie architecture style in 1964 as Sambo's Pancake House -- or else at another venerable greasy spoon called Bobo's. At Bobo's, the clientele seems about evenly divided between solid middle-class locals, pajama-clad University of Arizona students soaking up last night's toxins with cartwheel-size banana pancakes and heavily inked characters who look as if they had scraped up just enough change for a cup of Joe after posting bail.

I stop in at Bon, a boutique that the mother-and-daughter team of Bonnie and Crystal Flynt operate at the historic Five Points intersection to check out an always-evolving selection of design objects that meet their quirkily refined tastes. I troll the city's many thrift stores, following the advice of my pal Laura Wills, a part-time Tucsonan whose Screaming Mimi's vintage store in Manhattan is a way station in the life of 1960s satin sheaths or pearl-snap cowboy shirts unearthed at a Tucson Goodwill store and heading next to Burning Man. I stop into Tom's Fine Furniture and Collectables, an antiques mall whispered about by midcentury furniture dealers all over the country, who threaten those who reveal their secret source with bodily harm. Come lunchtime, I drive beneath Interstate 10 to the arid west side of the city, where hillsides are spiked with saguaros and where I once spotted a man at a roadside stand advertising his wares with a sign reading ""Honey & Knives."" My destination is Teresa's Mosaic Cafe, a Mexican restaurant unpromisingly set behind a McDonald's parking lot. Although, as Stephen Paul, the founder of Whiskey Del Bac, an award-winning mesquite-smoked single-malt distilled in Tucson, once authoritatively pointed out, ""the best Mexican food in the country"" is to be found on the city's largely Latino south side, I remain a Teresa's loyalist. The reasons are simple. Despite its unpromising location this 31-year-old restaurant offers surprising vistas from the windows of the circular structure it occupies and serves huevos rancheros good enough that Bobby Flay once chose the place for a Food Network throw-down. I prefer it at lunch, though, because by then Dora Robles has set up at a griddle near the center of the restaurant and begun patting and toasting the 500 or so tortillas she makes fresh daily: delicious wheat or corn wraps that provide packaging for Teresa's brightly spiced enchiladas, the most efficient lunch-delivery system ever devised. Heading out afterward, I often turn west onto Oracle Drive toward the Oro Valley and Tohono Chul Park, a small botanical garden on a patch of desert bought in the '60s by Jean and Richard Wilson (a Yale-trained geologist) and later established as a nonprofit to save the land from mall developers. Not the least of the things I like about this ingeniously designed garden of arid zone flora are the rattlesnake warnings posted along its paths. Yet the real reason I visit is the center's exhibition space, partly to check one of its fine and constantly changing art installations, but more candidly to pretend the Santa Fe-style adobe structure housing it is mine.

The menu at the landmark Hotel Congress (311 East Congress Street, 520-622-8848) is solidly if blandly confined to American standards whereas Maynards Market & Kitchen (400 North Toole Avenue, 520-545-0557), in the old train station, favors American cooking and locally sourced ingredients inflected with a French accent. Five Points Market & Restaurant (756 South Stone Avenue, 520-623-3888) is like a bit of Williamsburg dropped into a historic intersection in a funky but fast-developing part of town. When Bobby Flay decided to stage a huevos rancheros throwdown for the Food Network, he chose Teresa's Mosaic Cafe(2455 North Silverbell Road -- behind McDonald's -- 520-624-4512) on the city's arid west side. Super fresh and brightly spiced, the fare here is consistently tasty if not destined to set the culinary world on fire. In addition, Dora Robles stands at an exposed griddle set in the middle of the place, patting out and toasting 500 fresh tortillas by hand every day. The Arizona Inn also has a restaurant, bar and terrace where it serves uncontroversial if uninspiring country-club type fare. What to Do A prominent fixture on the international art scene and one of the pre-eminent art and photo galleries in the Southwest, the Etherton Gallery(135 South Sixth Avenue, 520-624-7370) shows works of fine art photographers, paintings, prints, sculpture and mixed media by local and regional artists, and offers a wide selection of works by masters of photography like Ansel Adams, Edward Sheriff Curtis and Weegee. At Bon, (760 South Stone Avenue, 520-795-2272, adjacent to the Five Points Market & Restaurant) the mother-and-daughter team of Bonnie and Crystal Flynt offer what their website calls a ""selection of our favorite things,"" including a well-edited array of clothes and candles and vintage textiles and greeting cards that could easily enough become your favorite things, as well.",One of the city's better-kept secrets is how often you can find significant examples of mid-20th century architecture.,5157a6bf-2987-5d00-9dca-99b0989cf5c1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/14/travel/14ARIZONAJP1/14ARIZONAJP1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=eec04d379e3029c12d4cdef3e9a9dacca62b36936233d49f0f71df78a5bebc17&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A neon sign on the Miracle Mile in Tucson.,5157a6bf-2987-5d00-9dca-99b0989cf5c1,N24News/imgs/5157a6bf-2987-5d00-9dca-99b0989cf5c1.jpg,4

Now the mayor has given Mr. Casals a new title: New York City's Cultural Affairs Commissioner, for the largest local funder of arts and culture in the United States.

""Art and culture should enrich the lives of all New Yorkers -- not just a select few,"" Mayor de Blasio said in a statement. ""Gonzalo understands how to uplift the experiences of New Yorkers from all five boroughs.""

Mr. Casals is an immigrant from Argentina who identifies as queer.

Books,Fluid Friendships: A Literary Ode to the Shifting Nature of Human Bonds,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/books/review/christina-hesselholdt-companions.html,"The protagonists of her novel are Camilla, Charles, Alma, Edward, Alwilda and Kristian, a cluster of friends in their 30s and 40s, three men and three women, all well educated and well mannered, and also well-off enough that they can afford to worry about an uncommon moment of melancholy and stillness in a garden rather than the grim business of making rent each month. At the novel's start, all six are paired up with other members of the group, but as time passes, divorce and illness drive wedges between existing couples and open spaces within which new romantic connections flourish. Camilla, who has nursed Charles through a long convalescence, is uneasily liberated when he severs the ties of their marriage, and copes by buying a discounted thoroughbred horse. Alwilda leaves Edward for a life of greater independence, free of his sensitivity and moping, while Alma leaves Kristian for similar reasons and later finds love with the discarded Edward.

These ruptures are overt signs of more subtle shifts the characters undergo as they live, love and grow older, but Hesselholdt's most penetrating insights into the texture of lived experience come in moments of vivid imagery and unexpected humor, which bridge the weight of biography and the lightness of an instant. Baby sharks in a pet-store aquarium ""are gray and look like ferocious anchors""; a red leaf is ""a slice of autumn."" In a breathtaking and inexplicably memorable scene, Alwilda parts ways with a young American she has met at a bar. Suddenly he reappears with his friends, all of them on bikes. ""Without stopping he reached out a long arm and grabbed my head and kissed me, impressively well coordinated,"" Alwilda recounts. ""He is far too young. I won't call him.""

Not every reader will find the dense, intricate mundanity of these interlinked monologues easy to appreciate. As in actual life, it can sometimes be difficult to tell whether something crucial is happening, or nothing at all. But those who find connections among these disparate moments will be rewarded with a rare and fragile experience: a rediscovery of the strength of narrative bonds, impossible to dissolve and difficult to forget, a miraculous substance that links the characters to one another and holds them in companionable relation.","Six friends pair off, split up and regroup in ""Companions,"" a light-footed novel by the Danish writer Christina Hesselholdt.",7acb0d1b-77b7-5916-94a9-fddc497271f2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/10/books/review/10Kleeman/10Kleeman-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=234&w=448&s=c6f14179dfebd008825548e42b2c4a66b3d662226a33d80c1762d932863703be&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Christina Hesselholdt,7acb0d1b-77b7-5916-94a9-fddc497271f2,N24News/imgs/7acb0d1b-77b7-5916-94a9-fddc497271f2.jpg,13
Books,"Shirley Ann Grau, Writer Whose Focus Was the South, Dies at 91",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/08/books/shirley-ann-grau-dead.html,"In the heat of the civil rights struggle, the Ku Klux Klan tried to intimidate Shirley Ann Grau, a white Southerner who had written about interracial marriage, by burning a cross on her front lawn. But they forgot to bring a proper shovel. Unable to plant the cross upright in the hard ground, they laid it down instead, and the flames soon sputtered out. As it happened, Ms. Grau (rhymes with prow) wasn't even home. And on hearing of the incident, she was more amused than distraught. ""It scorched a few feet of grass and it scared the neighbors,"" she told The Associated Press in 2003. ""It all had kind of a Groucho Marx ending to it.""

Her response typified her unflappable nature. ""She didn't hesitate to tackle controversial subjects, and she certainly wasn't going to be intimidated by the Klan,"" her daughter Katherine F. Miner said in an interview. Ms. Grau died on Monday at an assisted-living facility in Kenner, La., a suburb of New Orleans. She was 91. Ms. Miner said the cause was complications of a stroke. The object of the Klan's ire back in 1965 was Ms. Grau's novel ""The Keepers of the House,"" the story of a wealthy white widower and his 30-year relationship with his Black housekeeper, whom he secretly marries and with whom he has three children. Most of Ms. Grau's six novels and four story collections explored themes of race, power, class and love. They were deeply atmospheric, lyrical tales, most of them set in the Deep South, in worlds unto themselves. ""Shirley Ann Grau writes of our most sublimated and shameful prejudices, about how miscegenation infiltrates every level of society, and about how racial harmony is a pretense that integration alone is unable to address,"" Alison Bertolini, the author of ""Vigilante Women in Contemporary American Fiction"" (2011), told Deep South Magazine in 2013.

""The sounds and smells and folkways of the Deep South are conjured up and the onerous burden of the South's heritage of violence and of racial neurosis is dramatized in the lives of a few unhappy people,"" Orville Prescott wrote in a review in The New York Times. ""It is all an old and familiar story,"" he added, ""but seldom has it been told so well."" Many agreed. ""The Keepers of the House"" won the 1965 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. That was the last thing Ms. Grau expected. When the Pulitzer representative called to tell her she had won, she thought a friend was pulling a prank. ""Yeah, and I'm the queen of England,"" she replied, and hung up. Ms. Grau was pleased, of course, but not overly impressed with herself. She hung the award inconspicuously over the closet in her study, where few would see it. Along with attacks from the Klan, her work drew threatening phone calls from white supremacists. She took those calls in stride, undaunted, partly because she knew she could defend herself -- she had spent time in her youth hunting rabbits and squirrels with a .22-caliber rifle in Alabama. ""I remind the people,"" she told The A.P. of those callers, ""that I'm probably a better shot than they are.""

Shirley Ann Grau was born on July 8, 1929, in New Orleans. Her father, Adolph Eugene Grau, was a dentist, and her mother, Katherine (Onions) Grau, was a homemaker. She grew up in New Orleans and spent part of her childhood in Montgomery, Ala. She attended Newcomb College, the women's affiliate of Tulane University, where she majored in English and graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1950. She pursued graduate studies in literature at Tulane with the goal of teaching and writing. But, she told Deep South, when the English department chairman said he wouldn't hire women as teaching assistants, she dropped out before earning a higher degree. It was about that time that her short stories started to sell -- to The New Yorker, Redbook, The Saturday Evening Post, Vogue, Southern Review and Cosmopolitan, among other magazines. She married James Kern Feibleman, a philosophy professor at Tulane, in 1955. He died in 1987. In addition to Ms. Miner, Ms. Grau is survived by another daughter, Nora F. McAlister; two sons, Ian J. and William L. Feibleman; and six grandchildren.

Her story collections -- the others were ""The Wind Shifting West"" (1973), ""Nine Women"" (1985) and ""Selected Stories"" (2003) -- generally received more favorable reviews than her novels, though Jonathan Yardley of The Washington Post, among other critics, had a fondness for her novel ""The House on Coliseum Street"" (1961), about a young woman who has an abortion after an affair with a professor. If some faulted her novels for not presenting an overarching vision or unifying theme, others said that that was not her goal. ""She had no agenda,"" her friend Maurice duQuesnay, an associate professor of English at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, said in an email. Her interest, he said, was human nature and in creating a sense of place. She had told him, he recalled, that she viewed life as ""a muddle"" and that she wanted to show characters struggling to free themselves from the past and forging their own identities. Ms. Grau put it this way, when discussing ""The Keepers of the House"" with The New York Post in 1965: ""Somewhere in the book I try to say that no person in the rural South is really an individual. He or she is a composite of himself and his past. The Southerner has been bred with so many memories that it's almost as if memory outreaches life.""","In books like her novel ""The Keepers of The House,"" which won a Pulitzer Prize, Ms. Grau wrote unsparingly about race relations.",f44c3d28-f513-5ec4-b872-fe36312d0ce4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/11/obituaries/07Grau1/07Grau1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=497&w=950&s=c729dae5b5d9a205015e2ed3449b1283f12186643294b0ad2b1391abf6d68029&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The writer Shirley Ann Grau in 1992.

Real Estate,Chelsea Condo for $45 Million,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/realestate/chelsea-condo-for-45-million.html,"A full-floor penthouse at the Walker Tower, a 24-story Art Deco condominium conversion in Chelsea, where a record-breaking sale took place more than two years ago, sold in a private deal for $45,000,000, according to city records, and was the week's most expensive closed transaction.

The sale of PH2, at 212 West 18th Street, was nearly $6 million below the downtown record of $50.91 million that was paid for a neighboring penthouse in January 2014. But it still generated a relatively quick and hefty profit for the owner, who used the limited liability company BBC Chelsea; the apartment was bought from the sponsor for $40.73 million about 18 months ago and was used as a pied-a-terre.

Monthly carrying costs total $14,385, according to the Corcoran Group, whose agents handled both sides of the transaction for the unlisted property. Carrie Chiang represented the seller, while Jerry Huang brought the buyer, whose identity was also shielded by a limited liability company -- Walker Tower 1-8.

The penthouse has 6,738 square feet that includes five bedrooms and five and a half baths, along with a spacious north-facing terrace off the enormous living room and dining space. There are three wood-burning fireplaces and floor-to-ceiling windows that provide panoramic vistas of the harbor and cityscape.",A full-floor penthouse at the Walker Tower sold in a private deal and was the week's most expensive closed transaction.,d68a3d54-ed32-5831-a263-b86337b0f929,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/03/realestate/03TICKET/03TICKET-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=2562d5b8a0ca4ffcc00e80721abb85ea0071206dd39d953d19843bdf1af7d51c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Art Deco-style Walker Tower once served as home to the New York Telephone Company.,d68a3d54-ed32-5831-a263-b86337b0f929,N24News/imgs/d68a3d54-ed32-5831-a263-b86337b0f929.jpg,7
Art & Design,5 Art Accounts to Follow on Instagram Now,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/arts/design/instagram-art-accounts.html,"Every month or so, when it's been my turn to write this series, I've searched for a way to fit a comical, high-concept art project called Foodmasku into my theme -- but I never succeeded. So this time, I'm ditching the theme and presenting Foodmasku; a brilliant repost account called Black Rhizomes, whose curator I couldn't quite get ahold of; and three other, unrelated accounts that consistently entertain me, instruct me and cheer me up, but which haven't quite fit till now.

The New York artist Antonius Oki Wiriadjaja had four shows canceled this year, as well as a long-planned trip to Indonesia to work with shadow puppeteers. But after a chance conversation at a virtual meetup of the arts collective The Weekly Weekly, he decided to spend his spring lockdown making face masks, instead -- out of food. Every day he posted a new headshot of himself wearing fried tempeh, a watermelon helmet, quail eggs or a grilled cheese sandwich. It's a silly idea. But carried out and presented seriously, as Mr. Wiriadjaja did, it's an inspiring response to the anxiety and isolation of American life in 2020 -- or to the anxiety and isolation of virtual life in general. (It's also a great flashback to the ""big broccoli ocarina"" that Junji Koyama posted on YouTube in 2006.)

The Dutch photographer Rob Hornstra has a knack for taking beautiful pictures of desolation. He's done lush portraits of highly decorated veterans in the contaminated town of Argayash, Russia, and a long series about a troubled neighbor in Utrecht, the Netherlands. But most recently I've been wading through his documentary shots of the breakaway region of Abkhazia. (It is recognized as independent from Georgia only by Russia and a handful of other countries.) Part of the appeal, of course, is seeing a place I'll likely never visit. But there's also the special fascination of life in an improvised state: How do they manage to send mail abroad? Will these young wrestlers ever be able to compete under their own flag? It all seems strangely familiar.

A repost account loosely centered on Black music, art and history, Black Rhizomes is extraordinary both in its depth and its range. In one quick scroll you might find an incredible clip of the proto-hip-hop pioneers the Original Last Poets performing on a New York rooftop at the turn of the 1970s; a broadside from India's Dalit Panther Party, inspired by the Black Panthers; a photo of Carnival in Trinidad, by Maria Nunes, which leads to more photos of the Carnival band Vulgar Fraction; the sculptor Jack Whitten talking about the color of marble in ancient Greece; or a pair of tarot-card-style portraits of two members of the Sun Ra Arkestra. But what makes the feed a creative achievement in its own right is that -- like its architecturally themed sister account, Magnetic Ground -- it fits every find and quotation in its own consistent aesthetic.

In beach, street or travel scenes, mostly in and around Turkey, Ozcan Agaoglu captures the unmistakable rhythm of jostling elbows. He's not always shooting a party, necessarily -- for every extended family eating watermelon in the country or busy cafe that appears in his feed, there's a solitary swimmer, too, or a man riding the train with a pocketful of mint. But whatever the driving action of a photograph is, Mr. Agaoglu is comfortable leaving it off center, so that you feel as if you're peering across a crowded room to see what's happening on the other side. If there's a woman entering an apartment building with a handful of balloons, you must be headed for the very same party, right behind her; if the scene is a rainy outdoor cafe in Istanbul, you're drinking coffee just across the street. Those rhythmically jostling elbows, in other words, are your own.","Wearable cookies, rooftop poets and life in the breakaway region of Abkhazia: Here are some of the Instagram accounts brightening our art critic's daily feed.",7897c0cb-1078-506c-aa14-81a07636e441,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/16/arts/16instagram-art/16instagram-art-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=e490b6ab05522aa42ffa13822eee972b85ea37cd6a81962b83ac62e30ebff311&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"An untitled portrait from 2018 by the photographer Sarah Waiswa, who works out of Nairobi, Kenya.",7897c0cb-1078-506c-aa14-81a07636e441,N24News/imgs/7897c0cb-1078-506c-aa14-81a07636e441.jpg,14
Music,Europe's 'Rising Star' Musicians Give as Much as They Get,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/arts/music/echo-rising-stars.html,"The Rising Stars program puts young musicians on European tour. This season's class includes, clockwise from top left, the violist Ellen Nisbeth, the trumpeter Tamas Palfalvi, the violinist Emmanuel Tjeknavorian and the soprano Nora Fischer.

HAMBURG -- ""It's good if you keep clapping,"" the percussionist Christoph Sietzen told the audience at the Elbphilharmonie concert hall here on a recent evening, ""because the next piece is extremely quiet and I need to catch my breath."" Mr. Sietzen had just completed a fiercely athletic rendition of ""Rebonds"" by Iannis Xenakis and was composing himself for the crystalline stillness of Arvo Part's ""Variations for the Healing of Arinushka."" (The combination is a percussionist's equivalent of the Olympic biathlon.) When the applause, now even louder and mixed with laughter, had died down, he took up position at a marimba and coaxed from it sounds of rapturous fragility. He was performing as one of the Rising Stars, an initiative of the European Concert Hall Organization (ECHO). A loose confederation of 21 of the Continent's premier performance spaces, ECHO has been boosting the careers of young soloists and chamber groups since 1995 by sponsoring tours through its constituent halls.

Each hall may nominate one artist or ensemble per season, but because logistics make it necessary to limit the number of ""stars"" each year to six or seven, halls sometimes join forces to push for a performer -- often, though not always, with a national connection. (Mr. Sietzen, who is from Luxembourg and lives in Austria, was nominated by the Philharmonie Luxembourg.) The final crop is selected after a round of sometimes heated negotiations among ECHO representatives who try to come up with a mix of nationalities and instruments.

""They actually fight over you,"" the Hungarian trumpeter Tamas Palfalvi said in a phone interview. For audiences, the program offers a chance to catch musicians on the cusp of major careers. Past participants include the pianist Igor Levit, the violinist Patricia Kopatchinskaja and the cellist Jean-Guihen Queyras -- all artists with an appetite for adventure and wide-ranging collaboration. That innovative spirit has been increasingly emphasized by ECHO through the addition of a robust commissioning program that allows the ""rising stars"" to have a work tailored to them by a composer of their choice. Over the past five years, a professional development aspect has been added, too, offering targeted coaching in engaging with listeners. ""It's important for them to learn from the beginning that it is part of their job to communicate with the public,"" the general and artistic director of the Elbphilharmonie, Christoph Lieben-Seutter, said in an interview. Indeed, the program's ambitions are high. ""We ask existential questions,"" said Andrew Manning, the secretary general of ECHO. ""Why this art form? Why do we do what we do? What is the vision of these artists? And how can I use the prestige of this wonderful range of concert halls, from the 19th-century Concertgebouw to the Elbphilharmonie, to enable that vision?"" The resulting concerts -- I saw four of the six presented in one week in Hamburg -- weld outstanding musicianship to charisma, humor and a twist of the unexpected. By the end of the festival I started to wonder who the true beneficiaries of the initiative were: It seemed quite possible that these young musicians and their fresh ideas were throwing a lifeline to the venerable concert halls, rather than vice versa.

Mr. Palfalvi, the trumpeter, brought juicy tone and chiseled passagework to works by Bartok, Enescu and Sarasate. His natural showmanship came through, especially in Peter Eotvos's ""Sentimental,"" in which Mr. Palfalvi created an imaginary dialogue between Miles Davis and Chet Baker, sometimes holding a cornet and a fluegelhorn simultaneously. The soprano Nora Fischer, who lives in Amsterdam and is the daughter of the Hungarian conductor Ivan Fischer, divided her recital into halves. One was performed with piano, with aphoristic songs by Poulenc and Messiaen; the other, accompanied by a theorbist, was devoted to early Baroque composers, including Monteverdi and Barbara Strozzi. Female composers were also integrated into recitals I didn't catch: The Swedish violist Ellen Nisbeth performed works by Kaija Saariaho and Katarina Leyman; the Van Kuijk Quartet, founded in Paris, a new commission by Edith Canat de Chizy. Mr. Palfalvi spoke enthusiastically of the educational outreach that is part of each stop. He has spoken to high school graduates about music careers, taught 6-year-olds to get a sound from a trumpet, and is learning to give master classes to conservatory-level musicians. That kind of educational work, he said, ""is not often our strong side when all you've learned is how to play on stage."" Some participants already come with a demonstrated passion for engaging new audiences: Mr. Tjeknavorian has a radio show in Austria; Ms. Fischer once performed a recital during which she cooked for and fed her audience. But the Rising Stars tour tests communication in different cultural and linguistic settings.

Along the way, the musicians hone their crafts, learning to adjust to different acoustics and to audiences with different expectations, etiquette and even clapping habits. Mr. Sietzen recalled a performance in Budapest, where the audience was more reticent than any he had so far encountered. Even after the bravura finish of ""Rebonds"" there was only polite applause. But later, following an especially subtle and dreamy tango by Astor Piazzolla arranged for the all-marimba Wave Quartet, of which he is a member, the audience expressed its enthusiasm with sustained clapping in unison. ""It was especially beautiful that this came after a piece that wasn't fireworks but something touching,"" Mr. Sietzen said, ""where only the music convinces.""",The Continent's premier concert halls pick a small class to go on tour.

The play is an experimental comedy that imagines a conversation between a maid and a clown left to clean up the dead bodies after the bloodshed that roils the ruling class in Shakespeare's gory tragedy.

An unusual project for Broadway, it marked the arrival of Mr. Mac to the commercial stage. His previous works, in which he often starred, were produced in nonprofit spaces. His best-known project, ""A 24-Decade History of Popular Music,"" has been presented to acclaim around the world.

Travel,Five Destinations That Call for Caution,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/travel/most-dangerous-destinations.html,"A recent report finds that visiting cities like Karachi , Pakistan, and Caracas, Venezuela, can be risky for travelers.

Staying safe while traveling is a topic which continues to be relevant as terrorist attacks are no longer a surprise and mass shootings seem to be increasingly common. Is almost every destination in the world a potential danger? In fact, according to the latest Safe Cities Index, some places pose considerably more risk than others. The report was released late last year by The Economist Intelligence Unit, the research and analysis division of The Economist Group, a London-based company that specializes in international business. The index ranked the safety of 60 international cities across four categories, including personal security, which scored each city on factors such as the number of terrorist attacks, crime rates, threat of military conflict and threat of civil unrest. The Safe Cities Index was first published in 2015, and the not-so-good news in the second version released in 2017 is that levels of personal security appear to have declined in the past two years, said Christopher Clague, a managing editor at The Economist Intelligence Unit and the creator of the index.

Below, according to the Safe Cities Index, are the five most dangerous destinations in the world right now. Karachi, Pakistan The port city of Karachi has ongoing security issues, including ethnic, political and sectarian violence, a high crime rate and terrorism, said Matthew Bradley, the regional director of security for International SOS, a travel risk management company. ""Karachi is not a city where you should go unless you absolutely have to,"" he said. Greg Boles, an associate managing director for Kroll, a security consulting company, said that Karachi is subject to a high number of terrorist attacks from both foreign and indigenous terrorist groups, including the Pakistani Taliban. ""U. S. citizens are a target in Karachi and can get kidnapped for ransom,"" he said. Mr. Boles also said that because Pakistan borders Afghanistan, the Taliban and its well-established networks can transport United States citizens from Pakistan to that country. Caracas, Venezuela Venezuela's capital is unsafe when it comes to personal security, Mr. Bradley said, because of the prevalence of violent crime and frequency of sexual assaults on women. ""Crime is endemic, and opportunistic street crime and more serious offenses such as kidnapping, carjacking and armed robbery have become increasingly common,"" he said.

Mr. Boles, who has previously worked in Caracas, said that the city has a food and medicine shortage, which causes social unrest and protests. ""The general population doesn't have access to basic necessities and can act out in frustration,"" he said. ""If you're visiting, you can easily become a part of the mess and may be detained without access to clean water or food."" Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam It may seem surprising to see this French colonial metropolis, formerly known as Saigon and popular with tourists, ranked among the top five dangerous destinations, but Mr. Boles said that crime is an issue there, including violent, organized and petty offenses. Ho Chi Minh City's dense population makes active policing a challenge, and because bicycles and scooters are a common mode of transportation, perpetrators can quickly flee. Mr. Bradley said that visitors, particularly when in tourist areas such as those around Pham Ngu Lao and Dong Khoi, shouldn't display any valuable items like jewelry or cellphones, or walk alone after dark. Additionally, they should be aware that drinks and food may be drugged. Yangon, Myanmar The tension between Myanmar's Muslim and Buddhist communities makes Yangon an unsafe place to be, said Mr. Boles. ""The fighting between the two ethnic groups can be violent and unpredictable,"" he said. ""From a tourist perspective, it's an unstable city because you don't know what's going to happen next."" Rohingya, a predominantly Muslim ethnic group, has been subject to serious human rights abuses, including murder and rape, according to international human right groups like Amnesty International. Quito, Ecuador Yes, it's a tourist destination, but crime, including pickpocketing, robbery and thefts in hotel rooms, is a significant concern, according to both Mr. Bradley and Mr. Boles. Mr. Boles said that tourists have been robbed when they're out and about in the city while Mr. Bradley said that Quito has a problem with what are known as ""express"" kidnappings. ""Travelers perceived to be wealthy have been seized and forced to withdraw large sums of money from their A.T.M. accounts,"" he said. ""While most express kidnappings end in the release of the abductee, in some cases, they have resulted in the death of the targeted individual."" The State Department's site says that ""crime is a widespread problem in Ecuador"" and also warns of express kidnappings.","A recent report finds that visiting cities like Karachi, Pakistan, and Caracas, Venezuela, can be risky for travelers.",64483c4b-3ee2-58b4-99f5-9448e985e56e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/11/travel/11dangerous/merlin_115863467_48343c6e-9e5c-4523-aea8-9674a2542dd9-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=fa885a71dc243acb27ed0118c15a36ea1b21233a1e3c35deb15340295184610e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Violent crime and the frequency of sexual assaults on women are among the reasons travelers may want to avoid travel to Caracas, the capital of Venezuela.",64483c4b-3ee2-58b4-99f5-9448e985e56e,N24News/imgs/64483c4b-3ee2-58b4-99f5-9448e985e56e.jpg,4
Sports,Tina Charles Is a W.N.B.A. Superstar Hiding in Plain Sight,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/sports/basketball/tina-charles-liberty-mystics-wnba.html,"Even if Tina Charles never plays another basketball game, she's bound to be a Hall of Famer. That's according to UConn's Geno Auriemma, her already-inducted former coach -- but it doesn't take winning 11 national championships to see that her enshrinement is inevitable. Some of her numerous accolades, though, already have a public place of honor. At Charlie's Records on Fulton Street in Brooklyn, a banner that's several feet tall bears a photo of Charles shooting in her Connecticut Sun uniform. It hangs above racks of calypso, soca and dancehall records, and next to several signs printed with Charles's No. 31 and ""MVP."" A large adjacent banner reads ""Bud Light Salutes Tina Charles, 2012 Olympic Gold Medalist."" Smaller photos and news clippings complete the tribute. About a half-hour walk away is Barclays Center, where the New York native might have continued chasing a W.N.B.A. championship, one of the few awards missing from what must be straining shelves of trophies. The accomplishment would certainly be recognized prominently at Charlie's Records, her father Rawlston Charles's decades-old Bedford-Stuyvesant record shop. In spite of Tina Charles's many rings and medals, her lack of deep postseason runs in the world's best women's basketball league has made her an all-time talent who's inexplicably hiding in plain sight.

""I think that eats at her,"" Washington Mystics Coach Mike Thibault said. ""I think she wants to re-establish that, 'Look, I'm one of the top players and I can help a team win a championship.' That was her big goal when she went to New York, and it didn't work."" Charles, who leveraged her franchise player status to get back to her hometown from the Connecticut Sun in 2014, was traded by the Liberty to the Washington Mystics earlier this year when the team hit a hard reset, liquidating almost all of its veteran talent. Instead of winning a title at Madison Square Garden for the team she grew up watching, Charles had been relegated to playing at the 5,000-seat Westchester County Center after James L. Dolan put the Liberty up for sale in late 2017. Joe Tsai, who owns the N.B.A.'s Nets, purchased the Liberty, giving them a new home at Barclays. Along with a new general manager, chief executive and head coach, the Liberty now have a young, development-oriented roster framed around their 2020 No. 1 draft pick Sabrina Ionescu. ""I was very thankful to play for the hometown team. Not a lot of people get that opportunity,"" Charles, 31, said in an interview. ""That's where I'm leaving it."" The Liberty declined to comment on the trade, instead sharing a statement from their chief executive, Keia Clarke: ""While she is no longer part of the team, her name will forever be synonymous with New York basketball.""

Charles was traded to the reigning W.N.B.A. champion Mystics, which also meant reuniting with Thibault -- who coached Charles after the Sun picked her first over all in the 2010 draft. Thibault helped her win awards like the rookie of the year (2010) and most valuable player (2012). ""He was the first person to believe in me,"" Charles said of Thibault. ""When you're consistent as a coach, you know how to get the best out of your players regardless of who's on your roster."" What the Mystics also have is an established group of top-tier players, something that has eluded Charles for much of her professional career. The Mystics have struggled to a 5-13 record in the W.N.B.A. bubble in Bradenton, Fla. without key starters like reigning M.V.P. Elena Delle Donne and Natasha Cloud. Charles is not with the team after receiving a medical exemption this season because she has extrinsic asthma and is at high risk of having complications from Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus. Thibault said that although Charles is on a one-year deal, she has verbally committed to returning to the Mystics next year. The 6-foot-4 center has the fifth most rebounds and the 11th-most points in W.N.B.A. history -- both because of her exceptional ability and because she's more or less had to shoulder that much of the load to keep her teams afloat. ""She's always been the one, not one of,"" said Bill Laimbeer, who coached the Liberty during four of the six seasons Charles played for the team and now coaches the Las Vegas Aces. ""She's been put in these situations where she has to be the standard-bearer without other Olympians around her; she was carrying us so heavily, she just ran out of gas.""

Being the one is familiar for Charles. In New York's always-competitive amateur basketball scene she was center stage, playing at the Garden with her Amateur Athletic Union team during Liberty halftimes and then again as the star player of the No. 1-ranked Christ the King team in 2006 (naturally, she hit the game-winner). As the best high school player in the country, she went to UConn, the best women's basketball program in the country. There, she became the best college player in the country, leading that team to two more titles.

""The expectations are so high for a kid like that, that I don't know that there's any way you could have said she exceeded expectations,"" Auriemma said. ""That would be impossible."" Charles has at least met, if not surpassed, those sky-high expectations at every level on the court, without necessarily getting much attention for doing so. Whether that's because of her lack of W.N.B.A. titles or her generally understated demeanor, Charles is unbothered by so often being in the background. ""It doesn't make me feel any type of way,"" Charles said. ""If your team isn't successful, you're not going to get individual success. I know it has nothing to do with my skill or anything I've been able to put out on the court."" Since 2013, Charles has donated her W.N.B.A. salary to her Hopey's Heart Foundation, which supplies automated external defibrillators to schools and recreational centers. This year, she's shifting that donation to organizations that support the Black Lives Matter movement, Black-owned businesses and Covid-19 relief. Her contributions will be in $846 increments, in recognition of the eight minutes and 46 seconds that have come to symbolize how long the police in Minneapolis pressed a knee into the neck of George Floyd, killing him. Charles attended a memorial service for Floyd in Brooklyn's Cadman Square Plaza. ""It's gotten overlooked that us W.N.B.A. players were the ones who were really on the front lines, who were always very vocal,"" Charles said. She and her Liberty teammates were initially fined for wearing T-shirts that bore the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter in 2016; even after being warned by the league about violating uniform policies, she wore her warm-up shirt inside out in protest. ""We didn't really have the support of the W.N.B.A. when Philando Castile and Alton Sterling's lives were lost,"" she said. ""It was totally different. So it's definitely very beautiful to see them support this cause just as they support breast cancer awareness, Pride, any other cause -- you know? It's really important.""","Charles has stacks of awards and eye-popping stats from her run with the Liberty. But a W.N.B.A. championship, and the spotlight, have eluded her.",8642edfe-e836-5c4d-a4b7-3446fbdb35cb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/07/sports/07wnba-charles-1/07wnba-charles-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=98bca6cdf3a9a9d3714b6cc3b0a790ee2f4ecd3c9fd28d6959d4461adfdd41e9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Tina Charles played six seasons with her hometown team, the Liberty.

Real Estate,Choosing Jersey Over the City,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/realestate/choosing-jersey-over-new-york-city.html,"College friends Lina Dorkhman and Olivia Zhang spent the first few years after graduating from New York University living at home, saving for what they assumed would be an eventual move back to the city. But after starting their apartment hunt from their respective New Jersey perches -- Ms. Dorkhman was living at her parents' house in Old Bridge, in Middlesex County, and Ms. Zhang was staying with family friends in the Newport neighborhood of Jersey City -- the women decided that, in fact, they would rather be in Jersey. Ms. Dorkhman and Ms. Zhang, both 25, reached that conclusion one afternoon in the fall of 2016, after touring their fifteenth Jersey City apartment of the day. It was a two-bedroom walk-up, on a corner Grove Street lot, and it was flooded with light. The apartment was both bigger and cheaper -- $2,550 a month -- than another place they had been seriously considering a few blocks away, and it was no-fee. The exposed brick in the kitchen, the spacious living room, the in-building washer and dryer, and the recent renovation were all strong points in the apartment's favor. And then they saw the bathroom.

The women, who moved in last January, said there hasn't been one -- besides a few pretentious college friends who were surprised that they would choose to live in New Jersey for reasons other than financial necessity. ""People crap on it all the time, but I love New Jersey,"" said Ms. Dorkhman, who, truth be told, had been leaning toward her home state the entire time. She keeps a map of Cape May on her bedroom wall and two paintings by a local Jersey artist, Steve Cote, hanging above the couch. Even their dish dryer, a gift from her mother, is shaped like New Jersey. ""I think Lina's love of New Jersey has influenced me as well,"" said Ms. Zhang, who grew up in Shanghai, Washington, D.C., and Southern California.

Having lived in Manhattan during college, neither had a strong desire to return. ""I knew that I'd be able to find a place in my price range, but I also knew the kind of places you can get for that,"" said Ms. Zhang, who lived in a two-bedroom share in Yorkville during her last two years of college, paying $1,300 a month. ""I'd rather have more space. I don't remember anyone ever really having a living room in the city."" As for Ms. Dorkhman, her last Manhattan apartment was a windowless closet in an East Village share for which she paid $1,250 a month. Brooklyn was more appealing, but they soon discovered that the apartments they could afford there weren't close to transportation or, more crucially, to neighborhood amenities like stores and restaurants. ""In Bed-Stuy we saw a couple nice buildings, but in our budget we were looking on the outskirts,"" Ms. Zhang said. ""It's not like here, where you walk downstairs and there's a coffee shop and grocery store.""

Their location in downtown Jersey City, by contrast, is prime. The PATH train station is just a four-minute walk away; also nearby is a park with a farmers' market on Sundays and 99 Ranch Market, a Chinese grocery where Ms. Zhang often shops. Razza, the pizza shop on their block, has been attracting hordes from across the Hudson ever since The New York Times's restaurant critic, Pete Wells, claimed in a September review that the best pizza in New York was in New Jersey. ""I like that it feels like a community here,"" Ms. Dorkhman said. ""There are parades, fall festivals, kids walking around in Halloween costumes. Sometimes I walk down the street and it feels like I'm in 'Beauty and the Beast': 'Bonjour, Bonjour.'""","After saving to move back to New York City, two recent graduates decide they'd rather live in Jersey City.",29c12c23-abd7-599c-99c6-08f289038591,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/03/realestate/03renters3/03renters3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=4a69c339ff85db83253537102ca50ab19c35615303dec31b97a6a4672ec90575&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"After graduating from New York University, Lina Dorkhman and Olivia Zhang moved home so they could save enough to return to the city.

Opinion,Gay Rights Are Civil Rights,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/opinion/lgbt-supreme-court-ruling.html,"That's true, of course. They also could not have imagined that it would cover sexual harassment of male employees -- and yet in 1998 the Supreme Court found unanimously that it did. ""Statutory prohibitions often go beyond the principal evil to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed,"" the court said then, in an opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia.

Justice Gorsuch, who succeeded Justice Scalia on the bench, reiterated this basic concept on Monday: ""The limits of the drafters' imagination supply no reason to ignore the law's demands. When the express terms of a statute give us one answer and extratextual considerations suggest another, it's no contest. Only the written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to its benefit.""

While we're on the subject of legislators' intentions, it is worth noting the historical irony behind the inclusion of ""sex"" in the civil rights law -- which was, after all, targeted primarily at racial discrimination. The term was added at the last minute by Representative Howard Smith, a staunch segregationist from Virginia, in the hope that lawmakers would see it as a bridge too far and vote down the entire bill. Mr. Smith's failed gambit continues to pay off in ways that he surely never could have dreamed.

Still, there are reasons to be cautious.

Justice Gorsuch's commitment to textualism, a method of interpreting laws by looking solely to their plain words, achieved a just result in this case, but when applied too rigidly it can lead to very unjust results. In his previous job on a federal appeals court, then-Judge Gorsuch wrote an opinion holding that a trucker could legally be fired for abandoning his broken-down truck in subzero temperatures -- based on a wooden reading of the word ""operate."" In short, this particular victory for gay rights was based not on the fundamental equality or dignity of gay and transgender Americans, as previous Supreme Court decisions have been; it was based on the meaning of a single word.

The opinion also hints at a potentially serious obstacle on the horizon: claims by employers that being prohibited from discriminating against gay and transgender workers violates their religious convictions. Such claims are likely to find a sympathetic ear among this Supreme Court's conservative majority, which has repeatedly voted to protect if not promote religion and religious objectors.

For now, however, Monday's decision is a victory to savor, the next major step in a line of gay rights decisions stretching back nearly a quarter century, and until now written solely by Justice Anthony Kennedy.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who succeeded Justice Kennedy in 2018, graciously admitted as much in his own dissent. Although he disagreed with the majority's opinion, he wrote: ""It is appropriate to acknowledge the important victory achieved today by gay and lesbian Americans. Millions of gay and lesbian Americans have worked hard for many decades to achieve equal treatment in fact and in law. They have exhibited extraordinary vision, tenacity and grit -- battling often steep odds in the legislative and judicial arenas, not to mention in their daily lives. They have advanced powerful policy arguments and can take pride in today's result.""",The Supreme Court says you can't be fired for being gay or transgender.,88b3b922-ecb8-5f01-8127-282d8549fa7b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/15/opinion/15scotus1/15scotus1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=4933e6460f07543a43f1d0ec0366df1cd539b76ca7b581808487aa90d622b8fc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Protesters gathered outside of the Brooklyn Museum for a rally and silent march on Sunday.,88b3b922-ecb8-5f01-8127-282d8549fa7b,N24News/imgs/88b3b922-ecb8-5f01-8127-282d8549fa7b.jpg,11
Movies,'The Harder They Come': A Pop Classic That Has Hardly Faded,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/movies/the-harder-they-come-returns.html,"A brash bumpkin from the countryside comes to the city, dreaming of stardom. He cuts a record, gets ripped off, turns to trafficking drugs, is betrayed, and dies a folk hero at the hands of the police as his song becomes an anthem. ""The Harder They Come,"" currently being revived at BAM Rose Cinemas and Metrograph, is a universal story set in a highly specific milieu. Powered by one of the most infectious scores in the history of cinema, it is also a pop classic -- the movie that brought reggae to America and ""launched a thousand spliffs,"" as the New York Times critic Ben Brantley joked in a 2008 review of a theatrical version in London. Inspired by the life of the Jamaican outlaw Ivanhoe ""Rhygin"" Martin, credited with the line that gives the movie its title, ""The Harder They Come"" was a vehicle for the reggae star Jimmy Cliff. It was independent Jamaica's first homemade feature, as well as the first film directed by Perry Henzell, a scion of that nation's white planter class. The distinguished black playwright Trevor Rhone co-wrote the script . (""The Harder They Come"" is being shown in conjunction with the theatrical release of Henzell's long-delayed follow-up, ""No Place Like Home,"" which is also at BAM.)

Beginner's luck -- or lack of same -- might almost be the movie's subject. Robbed upon arrival in Kingston, Ivan Martin (Cliff) founders at first in the urban maelstrom. Social conditions are manifest in documentary -type shots, filmed in 16 millimeter, of poverty and desperation. Ivan finds his footing only to mix it up with an assortment of predatory preachers, mercenary record producers, corrupt cops and miscellaneous hustlers. In the background, Toots & the Maytals, Desmond Dekker, Cliff and others sing a collective siren song of fame . Chased by the police, Ivan creates his own legend, leaving graffiti (""I am here -- I am everywhere"") and imagining an audience for his last stand.

A movie of abrupt transitions, ""The Harder They Come"" appears to have been assembled piecemeal and shot off the cuff. Cliff, who wrote the title song, has described the film changing direction while in production. In an article published in The Caribbean Quarterly in 2015, the cinematographer Franklyn St. Juste said he never saw a script: ""I really didn't know what was happening -- and what was going to happen from one scene to the next or from one setup to the next."" But the spontaneity proved a recipe for what St. Juste termed ""happy accidents."" The timing was also fortuitous . The film arrived on the international scene in the wake of ""Shaft"" (1971) and ""Superfly"" (1972), with a hero akin to the righteous outlaws in films like the Brazilian director Glauber Rocha's ""Antonio das Mortes"" (1969), Melvin Van Peebles's ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song"" (1971) and numerous Italian westerns. (It's hardly coincidental that Ivan goes to see ""Django,"" Sergio Corbucci's 1966 evergreen.) For early audiences, Ivan's willingness to defy authority at the cost of his life evoked Bonnie and Clyde, the Black Panthers and Che Guevara. After making a splash at the 1972 Venice Film Festival, ""The Harder They Come"" was picked up by Roger Corman's New World Pictures; it opened (with English subtitles, because of the particularly thick Jamaican patois) to some success at a Broadway theater in February 1973 and enjoyed a second run as an exploitation film. (I saw it that summer in Florida on a double bill with the Pam Grier prison movie ""Black Mama, White Mama."") It would soon have a third life. In a 1974 piece titled ""Films That Refuse to Fade Away,"" the New York Times critic Vincent Canby noted the movie's popularity as a midnight attraction. As reported by Canby, ""The Harder They Come"" ran for 26 weeks at the Orson Welles Cinema in Cambridge, Mass., in 1973. A true cult film, it was brought back in 1974, where, as Jonathan Rosenbaum and I wrote in our book ""Midnight Movies,"" it remained another seven years. In April 1976, The Times ran an article, noting that ""The Harder They Come"" had played 80 consecutive weekends at the Elgin Theater in Chelsea. (The run would continue there for months.)

In his enthusiasm, Canby called ""The Harder They Come"" ""a more revolutionary black film than any number of American efforts, including 'Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song.'"" In any case, ""The Harder They Come"" provided a model for later movies, most notably the 1980 British film ""Babylon,"" which belatedly opened in New York this spring and itself became a cult film. (It is on the Criterion Channel and can be streamed elsewhere.) That film's director, Franco Rosso, named ""The Harder They Come"" as his inspiration. ""Babylon"" (1980) might be a sequel, focusing on West Indian life in London. An immersive, verite-style movie following a disaffected young singer of a homegrown reggae group, it uses a constant flow of music to animate the struggle for survival in a hostile white world. ""The movie is more interested in what feels right than what seems right,"" the critic Wesley Morris wrote in his review for The Times. See one and stream the other. Even more than the program I caught in Florida, they make a sensational double bill.

Books,"As London Bookstores Reopen, Eager Readers Return",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/books/london-bookstores-reopen-coronavirus.html,"LONDON -- Just after 10 a.m. on Monday, Cathy Slater, the owner of Dulwich Books, stood waiting to welcome her first customers into the store in months. Bookstores in England were allowed to open their premises on Monday for the first time since the country went into lockdown in March. Slater said she was overjoyed to be back and had prepared especially: There was a vase of flowers on a table by the entrance, and a huge bottle of hand sanitizer on the counter. The first customer wasn't what she had hoped for. About 20 minutes after opening, a man stuck his head around the front door, and shouted, ""Do you sell Post-it Notes?""

Within minutes, Olivia Holmes walked in wearing a face mask. She was looking for ""The Redeemed,"" by Tim Pears, the final part of a trilogy set during World War I. Then another customer arrived, and a fourth loitered at the door: A sign in the window said, ""Maximum of three people in the shop."" The atmosphere was vibrant, if a little constrained. And it was a vibe that echoed at five other booksellers in the capital.

On Monday morning, Patrick Kelly, the owner of the used-book store Bookmongers of Brixton, sat behind a see-through plastic screen, looking at his store's heaving shelves. He was worried about the future, he said, because the neighborhood around the store had gentrified so much over the past decade and he'd become reliant on ""tourists and day trippers"" to get by. ""We can reopen today, but when we see a tourist again is anybody's guess,"" he said. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

But soon, a trickle of customers started buying. Paulo Sousa, 40, bought a medical textbook, though he said he didn't actually want to read it. Instead, he said, he was going to cut a shape in its pages and hide a present for his brother inside. At the back of the store, Matthew Nsubuga, 28, was staring intently at a shelf of science fiction books called S.F. Masterworks, with vivid yellow spines. ""I've been waiting for the shop to reopen, as I knew they had a lot,"" he said. Nsubuga said that he'd been reading science fiction during the lockdown -- including ""Dune"" by Frank Herbert -- and that books had ""helped me survive."" ""Reading kept my mind off all of the other issues in the world,"" he added. He left the store with six books costing 27 pounds, about $34, in total. Kelly smiled. ""This has been fantastic,"" he said, sounding surprised at the quick sales. ""The doom and gloom is going a little.""

In May, Waterstones, Britain's largest book chain, with over 280 stores, announced a new safety measure for reopening. Any book that a customer touched but didn't buy would be put away for 72 hours to cut the infection risk. At midday Monday, staff at the bright and spacious High Street Kensington branch were putting the policy into practice, having placed about 30 books -- including several by Jean-Paul Sartre, the author of ""Nausea"" -- onto a cart that would be wheeled into isolation. Many staff members wore plastic face shields but none of the half-dozen or so customers seemed to mind. ""I've been missing bookshops more than anything else,"" said Jeremy Smith, 54, a charity administrator who was clutching a notebook containing the titles of dozens of books he wanted to buy. He'd already found one: Angie Cruz's ""Dominicana,"" about an 11-year-old child forced into marriage. What book would he recommend people read to celebrate coming out of lockdown? ""I'd just recommend people keep reading,"" he said.

Daunt Books, in the Marylebone district of Central London, was conceived as a bookstore for travelers, with many of its shelves arranged by country so customers can find books about places they'll be visiting. James Thornington, a bookseller there, said on Monday that he hoped people would still want to buy them even if they couldn't go abroad -- maybe just to dream a little. That has been his approach to reading during lockdown, he said. He'd reread Gerald Durell's ""My Family and Other Animals,"" about a British writer's ramshackle childhood on a Greek island. ""It made me feel like I wanted to go right away,"" he added. Few of Daunt's customers seemed to be buying travel books on Monday, though some of their choices showed a desire for escape. Sally-Anne Stein, 57, had bought ""The Glossy Years,"" an autobiography by Nicholas Coleridge, the British magazine executive. ""It's the complete opposite of what's going on at the moment,"" Stein said. ""It's the '80s, '90s, everything's fake and nothing's miserable or bad."" Then she walked off, smiling broadly.

Jo Heygate, the manager of Pages of Hackney, stood behind the counter, looking out at an empty shop floor, and said that she had decided to stay closed to browsers, for now. That was partly because her store is tiny, she said: To comply with Britain's social-distancing rules, which require people to stay about six feet apart, she could only have admitted one customer at a time.

But it was also because her store had, somehow, made a success of the lockdown, she added. At first, the staff had panicked, thinking they wouldn't sell anything at all. But around a month in, Pages of Hackney began an online store -- something Heygate said the business probably should have done several years earlier. ""I sold two books about transgender resistance in half an hour of the store going up,"" she said. ""Those would normally have taken a month to sell."" She put the success down to the shop's loyal local customer base, as well as how interested people were to read books on issues about race at the moment, a subject the store had always pushed. Layla F. Saad's ""Me and White Supremacy"" was a big seller, Heygate said; so was Jeffrey Boakye's ""Black, Listed."" On Monday afternoon, there were almost 80 bags of books piled on the floor awaiting customer collection, and two boxes of mail orders ready to be sent out. A cycle courier was also careering around East London making deliveries. The fact that people wanted books on vital topics was great, Heygate said. But she really wanted to get customers in the store again, to talk about the issues and to attend events. ""It's like a boring, lonely, mail order business, which isn't what a bookshop's about,"" she said. ""A bookshop's a living thing.""","Charming neighborhood shops and slick chain outlets welcomed back customers, who snatched up titles as eclectic as the city itself.",ae3cf01e-65c1-53f7-b09e-290cfc7be85b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/17/arts/17bookstores8/17bookstores8-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=38beccd4e97f2c954c5e0f2b92b4cbf16f08f05582c8ce11fded8f61ee161d79&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Daunt Books, which first opened in 1912, reopened on Monday for the first time since London went into lockdown in March.",ae3cf01e-65c1-53f7-b09e-290cfc7be85b,N24News/imgs/ae3cf01e-65c1-53f7-b09e-290cfc7be85b.jpg,13
Fashion & Style,Their Relationship Morphed From Dislike to Inseparable,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/27/fashion/weddings/their-relationship-morphed-from-dislike-to-inseparable.html,"Because marriage is an ever-evolving experience, we constantly shift, change and, in some cases, start over. In It's No Secret, couples share thoughts about commitment and tell us what they have learned along the way. Occupations She is the founder of Nest Fragrances; he is the owner and chairman of HomeWorx. Both companies sell home fragrances and scented candles. Together they founded Next for Autism, an organization dedicated to supporting those affected by autism. They also created the NYC Autism Charter School in Harlem and Bronx, which recently opened. The couple married Sept. 17, 1992 at Temple Emanu-El in New York before 70 guests. A reception at Le Cirque followed. Together they have 19-year-old twins, Ali and David, who is autistic. ""When I first met Harry in 1989, I was renting a house in Quogue. We were both working on Wall Street and we disliked each other,"" said Ms. Slatkin, who was then 29. ""I didn't think much about him until a year later. A friend asked me to co-chair a charity called Henry Street. She told me we needed someone else to help and mentioned Harry.""

At the time, both were single. They decided to meet at the Regency Hotel bar. Ms. Slatkin arrived first. ""He walked in wearing a navy blue suit, a beautiful pale blue shirt and had dark hair. He looked amazing,"" she said. ""I thought, 'I can't stand him, but if I had to pick the perfect person to marry he would look like that.'"" Mr. Slatkin accepted the co-chairman position, and dislike morphed into friendship. Friendship turned into being inseparable. ""I developed a huge crush on him nine months into our friendship,"" Ms. Slatkin said. A year later when he invited her to go to Atlantic City, she assumed he would confess similar feelings. ""I thought this was a date situation,"" she said. ""I got a manicure and pedicure. I bought lingerie. Nothing happened. So I put my feelings in a safe and locked it."" Months later, when he asked her to accompany him again to Atlantic City, she had no expectations. ""During the evening, he put his arm around me and said, 'Want to go upstairs to get into something more comfortable?'"" she said. ""We lied on the beds frozen in our robes until morning, afraid of what the future held for our friendship. Both of us were afraid of taking that next step."" On the way home they stopped for gas. A blind man was selling heart-shaped rubber key chains that had the words ""I love you"" printed in red. Mr. Slatkin bought one. ""When he gave it to me I knew this was real, that we'd get married,"" she said. ""I still have it. It's in our safe.""

I've learned to be more positive because he is. He takes everything I want to do seriously. He makes me feel important, empowered and confident. That's changed my life and has given me the encouragement to create my own company and start our foundation for autism. To have a successful marriage you have to be flexible. I've learned to let the stupid things go and to accept him for who he is. One time we got into an argument and I got very upset. Harry told me to put everything that's good on one side of the scale, and what just happened on the other. He was right. When you look at it that way, we have so much that works, so much goodness. Doing that puts everything in perspective. I've also learned sometimes you don't have to win or make your point. My life changed when he walked into the bar that night. We're never apart. I don't go out with my girlfriends and he doesn't go out with his friends. We are very devoted to pleasing each other, that's the secret to our marriage. I'm very traditional. His opinion matters greatly. It's a way of telling him that he's important to me. Mr. Slatkin My mother gave me advice in the beginning of my relationship, ""You give 110 percent and expect zero back. If you do this, you won't be disappointed."" Laura doesn't give zero; she gives you everything. I'm a Leo. I'm stubborn. I have a big roar. We argue. I've tried to change and it's not going to happen. I'm neurotically neurotic about everything being in its place; Laura is not. She could talk on the phone and drive into the carwash. But we make it work. She's a good balance. I deal with her issues; she deals with mine. I've learned to be more accepting. To relax and let things go. To be more complimentary and less negative. There are things we don't agree on. I've learned to come back and listen to her.","""We are very devoted to pleasing each other, that's the secret to our marriage.""",304bc439-1145-55ce-9632-590613dc7f4a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/30/fashion/weddings/30NOSecret-Slatkin1/30NOSecret-Slatkin1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=8b32d08182afe28170c7a9f67f2dbb55814e0505660c97aa1dabf4a886065c3a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Laura and Harry Slatkin at their home in Manhattan.

Theaters closed in March because of the pandemic, and studios delayed the release of several much-anticipated films till the fall or even 2021. So you'd think there might not be much to recommend so far this year. But our chief critics, Manohla Dargis and A.O. Scott, are having none of that: they are championing several movies that hit theaters before the shutdown or were released online afterward. If you're looking for new movies that will challenge you, here are their picks.

The story: Set in Leningrad just after World War II, the freakishly tall nurse of the title tends to wounded soldiers in a hospital. But Beanpole fought in the war as well, and struggles, alongside her friend Masha, to overcome traumas of her own. What we said: ""This is only the second feature from the sensationally talented Russian director Kantemir Balagov (who was born in 1991), and it's a gut punch,"" Manohla Dargis wrote. ""It's also a brilliantly told, deeply moving story about love -- in all its manifestations, perversity and obstinacy.""

The story: A riff on ""Cyrano de Bergerac,"" the movie stars Leah Lewis as high schooler Ellie Chu, an outsider several times over in her small town: she's an Asian-American lesbian who's also a gifted writer. She unexpectedly bonds with a star football player (Daniel Diemer) who has a crush on the same girl she does. What we said: The film, directed by Alice Wu, ""transcends the limitations that frequently serve as obstacles to ingenuity in young adult movies,"" Kyle Turner wrote. ""By exploring issues of race and queerness with emotional complexity, it treats teenagers with the sophistication they deserve.""

The story: The Swedish abstract painter Hilma af Klint (1862-1944) was a trailblazer whose reputation was eclipsed by that of male artists. But in 2018 a career survey that stopped at museums including the Guggenheim tried to rectify that, and so does this documentary by Halina Dyrschka. What we said: ""'Beyond the Visible' bristles with the excitement of discovery and also with the impatience that recognition has taken so long,"" A.O. Scott wrote. ""It refreshes the eyes and the mind."" Watch the movie: Via Kino Marquee, a video on demand service that benefits local theaters.

The story: Tommaso Buscetta was a real-life member of the Sicilian Cosa Nostra who turned on his partners in crime in the 1980s, ultimately testifying in open court. In Marco Bellocchio's feature, he's played by Pierfrancesco Favino as a not entirely admirable figure out for revenge. What we said: ""Bellocchio's approach to the story is at once coolly objective -- the movie is part biopic, part courtroom procedural -- and almost feverishly intense,"" Scott wrote. ""He has a historian's analytical detachment, a novelist's compassion for his characters and a citizen's outrage at the cruelty and corruption that have festered in his country for so long.""

The story: Spike Jonze directs a cinematic version of the 2018 ""Beastie Boys Book,"" the tale of how Ad-Rock, Mike D and MCA morphed from punk rockers into best-selling rappers. What we said: The film ""has its own kind of beauty, even if the aesthetic is more dad rock than hip-hop,"" Scott wrote, adding, ""It's a jaunt down memory lane and also a moving and generous elegy."" Stream it: On Apple TV Plus.

The story: In near-future Brazil, a small town mourns the death of a matriarch. Then the town disappears from the map. The filmmakers Kleber Mendonca Filho and Juliano Dornelles mix elements from westerns and science fiction to create a wholly new story. What we said: ""An exhilarating fusion of high and low, the movie takes a shopworn premise -- townsfolk facing a violent threat -- and bats it around until it all goes ka-boom,"" Dargis wrote.

The story: Ricky Turner drives for a delivery company dropping off packages ordered online (the title refers to the note he leaves for absent owners), and his wife, Abby, works for a subcontractor providing home health care in Ken Loach's moving British drama about the gig economy. What we said: Loach is ""almost without peer as a filmmaker formidably committed to exposing the sins of our wages,"" Wesley Morris wrote, adding, ""He knows you're unlikely to cancel anything. But he damn sure wants you to think long and hard about that next one-click buy."" Watch the movie: Via Zeitgeist Films, which offers a list of online options.","Yes, it's been a weird year for movies, but our chief critics have still found plenty of gems.

Travel,36 Hours in Thessaloniki,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/travel/what-to-do-in-thessaloniki.html,"Frequently outshone by the idyllic Aegean Islands, and overshadowed by the ancient glories of Athens, Greece's second-largest city is hardly a household name. But the buzzing metropolis in the country's northern mainland doesn't need to trade on its looks or fame to earn respect. The once-powerful port is still filled with the Unesco-listed remains of the three empires that ruled it -- the Romans, the Byzantines and the Ottomans -- as well as many traces of its multireligious past, which saw Muslims, Christians and Jews living side by side. (Two world wars, a Turkish-Greek population exchange in the 1920s and the deportation of the Jews in the 1940s effectively ended the ""Jerusalem of the Balkans."") Sprinkled among those monuments are impressive contemporary restaurants, vintage shops, a notable C.P.C. (cafes per capita) ratio and a staggering B.P.P. (bars per person) quotient. So here's some rare advice for a weekend in Greece: Forget your swimsuit and leave your copies of Plato and Socrates at home.

2) 7 p.m. THE TOWER AND THE GLORY A Greek flag flutters atop the crenelated battlements of the circular White Tower, but the structure was actually built by the Ottomans, who captured Thessaloniki from the Byzantine Empire in 1430. (They built the tower later that century and ruled the region until the Greek state captured it in 1912.) The interactive exhibitions about city history are a bit mysterious to anyone who can't read Greek, but the glorious 360-degree view from the summit requires no translation. Admission, 4 to 8 euros, depending on season. Each level of The Aficionados, an elegant townhouse and restaurant, offers a distinctive temptation. On the ground floor, Dimitris Pamporis (a veteran of the three-Michelin-star restaurant l'Auberge de l'Ill in France) serves a multicourse tasting menu (90 euros), while the top story houses a plush cocktail bar. On the floor between, neo-Greek cuisine with Asian infusions is the star. Meat mavens can experiment with the ""Chinese Hot Dog"" (Iberian pork and Chinese cabbage) followed by a veal filet or rib-eye. For an Aegean evening, trawl the seafood side of the card. Among appetizers, thin crunchy discs of kohlrabi sculpturally enfold an excellent tuna tartare flavored with soy sauce, sesame oil and an inspired puree of beetroot and peanut butter. More Asian accents follow with a thick slab of cod atop a velvety potato puree tinged with yuzu and truffle. A three-course meal for two is around 100 euros. Middle Eastern music drifts from the sound system while smoke from silvery water pipes fills the air. Are we still in Greece? Yes and no. Built in the 16th century as a Turkish bath, the Aigli Geni Hamam is now an indoor-outdoor bar and nightclub where the lofty stone domes shimmer with disco balls, and the soaring pointed arches glow with colored lights. Complete the Greco-Ottoman fantasia with a mix of raki and honey (5.50 euros) or a Mythos beer (4 euros).

A vigorous uphill walk (or take the number 23 bus) leads you to the Ana Polis, or Upper Town, where the orderly grid of busy streets and dense apartment blocks gives way to peaceful winding lanes of small houses. You would need wax wings for a better view than the one afforded by the 15th-century Trigoniou Tower, while the nearby 14th-century Vlatadon Monastery ushers you into an intimate dark chapel decorated with wood-panel paintings, medieval Christian frescoes and a sign bearing an extraordinary message: ""At this place St. Paul preached to Thessalonians at his second missionary journey (51 A.D.)."" A bit downhill, the ancient Church of Hosios David contains two masterworks of early Byzantine art: colorful interlocking frescoes and a dazzling, radiant mosaic in the half-dome depicting a young Christ, a scroll in his hand, surrounded by rainbows, animals, fish and rivers. All are free.

Overlooking the centuries-old city wall, the two-story building housing Radikal restaurant is an Old World blend of stone, brick, planks and plaster embellished with contemporary sculptural lighting and Edison bulbs. The menu follows the same recipe, melding classic ingredients and 21st-century elements. No Greek meal is complete without feta cheese, which might arrive in a deep-fried grain coating, and drizzled with honey and pistachios. The exotic notes in the aubergine puree that accompanies the robust veal ragout come from touches of ginger and orange. Staying local, the wine list includes a Thessaloniki chardonnay that is a slimmer, softer iteration of its global cousins. Lunch for two: around 50 euros.

If the venerable Modiano covered market is still under renovation, follow your nose to nearby Kapani Market, a warren of bustling lanes lined with stalls selling everything from fresh fish to dried herbs to Orthodox icons. Hidden amid the skinned lambs and mountains of olives, Semente Cafe is a new espresso bar where you can grab a cappuccino (1.20 euros), along with teas, chocolate bars and packets of nuts and grains. For something more intoxicating, To Laikon is a house of spirits: bottles of wine, ouzo and fruit brandy line the walls. Helmets, uniforms, medals, boots, gas masks and deactivated grenades are among the offerings at John's Military, one of the many antique, vintage and junk shops along Tositsa and Karmpola streets, near the Roman Agora. (Old bands never die there either, as witnessed by the shop's vinyl albums by Midnight Oil, The Hooters and other acts you had almost forgotten.) To resurrect women's fashion of bygone decades, ring the bell at Vaudeville.room and enter a small apartment full of steamer trunks, flapper caps, leather handbags, 1970s glitter tops and other castoffs from Greece's hipper great-grandmothers. The circular domed monument known as the Rotunda is Thessaloniki's answer to Rome's Pantheon, and the structure's story is the story of the city itself: Built by the Romans in the early fourth century, the soaring space became a church under the Byzantine Empire and then a mosque during Ottoman rule. The marquee attractions are the remarkably intact fourth- to sixth-century paleo-Christian mosaics of archangels, saints, religious officials and ancient buildings that decorate the lofty dome, glittering and sublime. Admission, 2 euros.

The brilliant workmanship from the region's Roman period comes vividly to life in the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki, one of the few things open on Sunday. Every material has its exemplar. Gold? Exquisitely wrought myrtle wreaths of ultrafine gold leaf shimmer with delicate power. Glass? Tiny perfume vessels in rich blues and greens show remarkable prowess with the delicate material. Textile? Admire the purple silk with gold embroidery found in the tomb of the noblewoman, whose skeleton lies just alongside. And stone? From huge detailed floor mosaics with mythological scenes to intricate chiseled reliefs of battles and bacchanals, the rich colors and fine details awe in equal measure. Admission, 8 euros. Goodbye, drunk satyrs. Goodbye, naked Venuses. Goodbye, orgiastic ebullience. Crossing the street, you cross into the next era of Thessaloniki history at the Museum of Byzantine Culture, a modernist Le Corbusier-inspired building where long ramps slope upward through dark galleries of somber Christian creations. In addition to barrel-vaulted stone tombs painted with biblical scenes (Abraham's sacrifice, Lazarus's resurrection), the most moving items are the many wood-panel paintings: melancholy Christs, Madonnas and saints with long narrow faces and richly colored robes against glorious gold backgrounds. Admission 4 to 8 euros, depending on season. Situated in the heart of the Ladadika dining and nightlife district, the new 16-room Bahar Boutique Hotel (Edessis 10; baharboutiquehotel.com) occupies an elegantly renovated 1931 townhouse, with its own classy cafe-bar just next door. Doubles from 90 euros. The cafe-bar of The Caravan (1 Rebelou; thecaravan.gr) is more colorful, funky and kid-friendly -- thanks to an assortment of toys and games -- while the 13 rooms are done in a mix of retro and contemporary style. Doubles from 75 euros.","Greece's second city is filled with remnants of its multilayered past, but sprinkled among the monuments are plenty of modern diversions.",7abed963-f9e0-5a1e-965e-e411d520014b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/02/travel/02HOURS5/02HOURS5-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=a021dc9cd56b80748a085ae9e02d31560e99adfabdba3cdc00d9b2b020a63922&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A view of Thessaloniki and the Aegean Sea from the 15th-century Trigoniou Tower.,7abed963-f9e0-5a1e-965e-e411d520014b,N24News/imgs/7abed963-f9e0-5a1e-965e-e411d520014b.jpg,4
Real Estate,A Quiet Condo in the Financial District,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/realestate/a-quiet-condo-in-the-financial-district.html,"A decade ago, when Harris Melmed's company moved him to Manhattan from the Philadelphia area, he rented a one-bedroom in a Hell's Kitchen tower. When the rent rose, he moved to another one-bedroom in a newer building nearby.

Mr. Melmed, now 40, works for a pharmaceutical company. Four years ago, he met Eric Hannah, 45, a personal trainer, at an ""Out at Night"" event at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey. Two years ago, Mr. Hannah moved from Philadelphia to be with Mr. Melmed.

The couple lived in a two-bedroom rental in the West 50s, with the second bedroom for Mr. Hannah's daughter, who visits often. Their apartment overlooked Eighth Avenue, which, although convenient, turned out to be loud. They could set their watches by the arrival of sanitation trucks at the hotel across the street in the middle of the night. Cars sat at the corner with music blaring.

Economy,'Staggeringly High': U.S. Jobless Claims Remained Elevated Last Week,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/business/economy/unemployment-jobless-claims-coronavirus.html,"Applications for jobless benefits remained high last week, even as the collapse of stimulus talks in Washington raised fears of a new wave of layoffs. Unemployment filings have fallen swiftly from their peak of more than six million last spring. But that progress has recently stalled at a level far higher than the worst weeks of past recessions. That pattern continued last week, the Labor Department said Thursday: More than 800,000 Americans filed new applications for state benefits, before adjusting for seasonal variations, roughly in line with where the total has been since early August. ""The level of claims is still staggeringly high,"" said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at the career site Glassdoor. ""We're seeing evidence that the recovery is slowing down, whether it's in slowing payroll gains or in the sluggish improvement in jobless claims."" That slowdown comes as trillions of dollars in government aid to households and businesses has dried up. Prospects for a new stimulus package, already dubious in a divided Washington, appeared to fall apart this week when President Trump said he was pulling out of negotiations. Economists across the ideological spectrum warn that the loss of federal help will lead to more layoffs and business failures, and more pain for families.

The continued high level of jobless claims, combined with large monthly job gains, highlights the remarkable level of churn still roiling the U.S. labor market. Companies are continuing to rehire workers as they reopen, even as other companies cut jobs in response to still-depressed demand for goods and services. The result is a job market that is being pulled in two directions at once -- and economic data that can appear to tell contradictory stories. Adding to the challenge for analysts and forecasters, the pandemic has thrown the data itself into disarray. For the second week in a row, the jobless claims data carried a Golden-State-size asterisk: California last month announced that it would temporarily stop accepting new unemployment applications while it addressed a huge processing backlog and installed procedures to weed out fraud. In the absence of up-to-date data, the Labor Department is assuming California's claim number was unchanged from its pre-shutdown figure of more than 225,000 applications, or more than a quarter of the national total. The state began accepting new filings this week, and is expected to resume reporting data in time for next week's report. While the lack of data from California makes week-to-week comparisons difficult, the bigger picture is clear: The economic recovery is losing momentum, even as millions of Americans remain out of work. Monthly jobs data released last week showed that job growth slowed sharply in September, and that last spring's temporary furloughs are increasingly turning into permanent job losses. Major corporations like Disney and Allstate have announced thousands of new job cuts. And with winter approaching, restaurants and other businesses that were able to shift operations outdoors during warmer weather could be forced to pull back anew.

Separate data from the Census Bureau on Wednesday showed that 8.3 million Americans reported being behind on rent in mid-September, and 3.8 million reported that they were likely to be evicted in the next two months. Both figures have changed little since August.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""It seems increasingly unlikely that we'll have a deal before the election, and bills are due now,"" Mr. Zhao said. ""Every week that passes puts extra pressure on workers' households and small businesses, so any delay in the stimulus is going to have a meaningful impact on Americans."" The situation is particularly dire for people who lost their jobs early in the pandemic, many of whom are now nearing the end of their unemployment benefits. Last week was the 29th week since mass layoffs began in March. In most states, regular unemployment benefits last just 26 weeks, meaning that many people have already exhausted their benefits. In March, Congress created a program funded by the federal government for people whose state benefits have expired. The number of recipients under that program, Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, swelled to nearly two million in mid-September, up from 1.4 million a month earlier. The program adds only 13 weeks of additional benefits, however, so people who lost their jobs in March will receive those benefits only until mid-December. And the entire program will expire at the end of the year if Congress doesn't extend it. A separate program, which existed before the pandemic, offers an additional 13 to 20 weeks of benefits, depending on the state. But the benefits are based on state economic conditions, and the rapid decline in the unemployment rate means that workers in several states, including Idaho, Wyoming and Utah, would no longer qualify for it. Missouri will join their ranks next week.","More than 800,000 Americans filed new applications for state unemployment benefits.",345d7ba7-6dc1-5d86-b1c9-d897cdf42d3c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/10/business/08markets-brf-jobless/10markets-brf-jobless1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=45a33d5054706f3f78b0ba6a4f9e74d7c61454237d3411b6eb56f87e3d1e2d30&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"An empty retail space on Madison Avenue in New York.

Music,A Young Composer Takes On Opera's Oldest Myth,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/arts/music/eurydice-opera-aucoin-ruhl.html,"Credit...Emily Berl for The New York Times





LOS ANGELES -- It wouldn't be a new opera without a little drama. In the days leading up to the premiere of ""Eurydice,"" Matthew Aucoin's operatic adaptation of Sarah Ruhl's play, the lead soprano couldn't sing. (Doctor's orders.) The baritone playing her father was getting over a cough. As if there weren't enough pressure on this production already. Opening at Los Angeles Opera on Saturday, ""Eurydice"" is a big work, with a big cast and chorus, and the baggage of big expectations: It will head to the Metropolitan Opera next year. Given the circumstances, Mr. Aucoin -- the opera's 29-year-old composer and conductor -- was surprisingly cool. Adjusting his best-laid plans with each opening-week surprise, he seemed more at ease than ever before in his young yet prodigious career. You got the sense that, in the years he's been working on ""Eurydice,"" he's grown up. Sure, there's still youthful brashness in the very idea of producing a new version of the Orpheus story -- the subject of the oldest surviving opera as well as the earliest one still regularly performed. (And also the Broadway hit ""Hadestown."") But ""Eurydice"" reduces the myth to intimate scale for a spare, poetic, magic-tinged meditation on loss and remembrance, told primarily from the perspective of Orpheus's wife.

But it was by no means an unimpressive debut; Anthony Tommasini, reviewing the premiere for The New York Times, described it as ""taut, teeming and inspired."" The baritone Rod Gilfry, who starred as Whitman and has returned to play the heroine's father in ""Eurydice,"" said he admired that Mr. Aucoin was already ""keenly tuned to what a voice can do."" And it taught Mr. Aucoin a lot about himself. ""It's quite challenging to be your own librettist,"" he said. ""You have to be your own harshest critic and enemy, and you really have to bisect your brain: You work as a playwright first to create something that has a bone structure, and then return to it with a composer's eyes. And I learned over the course of creating 'Crossing,' I have an instinct for musical form and poetic form. But I'm not a playwright."" That feeling changed the course of his next opera. He knew he wanted to expand on his Orpheus-theme cantata, ""The Orphic Moment."" But that 17-minute piece, with his own text, is a dark consideration of whether Orpheus looks back at Eurydice -- and damns her to a second death -- because it might be fruitful inspiration for his music. The full operatic version was shaping up to be just as cynical. ""It's a quite twisted view of their relationship, and it felt like a difficult place to live in for two hours,"" he said. ""Also, the tortured-male-artist perspective became more depressing for me."" Then Mr. Aucoin read Ms. Ruhl's ""Eurydice,"" first performed in 2003. He didn't think it would take much to turn it into a libretto: The script is plain-spoken, concise and naturally musical. (In an interview, Ms. Ruhl recalled a phrase she once wrote in a poem: ""small words with purpose."") ""When you think whether something can be set to music,"" Mr. Aucoin said, you ""tap"" it to test its acoustics. ""That has to do with the emotion behind it and what happens in the silences, and Sarah's text has the acoustic of a cathedral. You tap almost any word, and there are wells of emotion underneath it. It's aware of what it can't say, and that invites music to complete the sentence.""

Mr. Aucoin and Ms. Ruhl met through Andre Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater (the Met's partner in a program that developed ""Eurydice""), and quickly decided to collaborate. She appreciated that he was roughly the same age as she was when she wrote the play, and said she was fascinated by the line between poetry and song, and the question ""of where a phrase can lift off and become music."" Her libretto has expanded Mr. Aucoin's expressive palette. He said that ""Crossing,"" like so much of contemporary American opera, had a darkness that verged on ""self-seriousness and monochromaticism."" But Ms. Ruhl's text for ""Eurydice"" can be laugh-out-loud funny and surreal, with sly turns toward heartbreak and horror. Mr. Aucoin has aimed for his score to be a musical analogue.

""I was sort of attracted to the idea of the underworld being like a dentist's waiting office, but I knew that wasn't right and not of Sarah's world of the original play,"" she said, adding that future productions could reimagine the settings: ""Down the line, people can envision the underworld as a dentist's waiting office or a library or a street corner."" Mr. Aucoin has written a score with shifting tones and feelings, and so Ms. Zimmerman developed an aesthetic vocabulary that is at once literal -- ""A beach is a beach,"" she said -- and whimsical. She has also kept the chorus offstage, to maintain the story's intimacy. This week, she was still making adjustments. At first she wanted to project supertitles on the set: ""I think the gaze of the audience member to the stage should be that of a lover,"" she said, ""that unbroken staring into the face and loss of self."" But after the dress rehearsal -- in which Erica Petrocelli sang Eurydice while Danielle de Niese continued to recover from a neck injury -- Ms. Zimmerman took them out. In the orchestra pit, Mr. Aucoin had his own refinements. He was often self-deprecating, correcting the players while also placing the blame on himself: ""This is my fault as an orchestrator,"" ""I may have been a little too enthusiastic."" His demeanor at the podium has evolved since he started conducting his work. By his own description, he was once ""a full-body conductor, to an egregious extent""; when he led a performance of ""The Orphic Moment"" in 2016, his arms swung as he breathed heavily and vocalized with the instrumentalists. Now he is more restrained and practical in his movements, more confident. This change, from a young artist with something to prove to one increasingly comfortable in his own skin, is in the score for ""Eurydice,"" as well. Mr. Gilfry said it's ""on a whole other level, a quantum leap from his other writing.""

Well,More Young People Are Dying of Colon Cancer,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/well/live/more-young-people-are-dying-of-colon-cancer.html,"When researchers reported earlier this year that colorectal cancer rates were rising in adults as young as their 20s and 30s, some scientists were skeptical. The spike in figures, they suggested, might not reflect a real increase in disease incidence but earlier detection, which can be a good thing. Now a sobering new study has found that younger Americans aren't just getting cancer diagnoses earlier. They are dying of colorectal cancer at slightly higher rates than in previous decades, and no one really knows why. ""This is real,"" said Rebecca L. Siegel, an epidemiologist with the American Cancer Society and the lead author of the current study, published as a research letter in JAMA, as well as of the earlier report. ""It's a small increase, and it is a trend that emerged only in the past decade, but I don't think it's a blip. The burden of disease is shifting to younger people."" The study found that even though the risk of dying from colon and rectal cancers has been declining in the population over all, death rates among adults aged 20 to 54 had increased slightly, to 4.3 deaths per 100,000 people in 2014, up from 3.9 per 100,000 in 2004.

""This is not merely a phenomenon of picking up more small cancers,"" said Dr.Thomas Weber, who was not involved in the study but is a member of the steering committee of the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable. ""There is something else going on that's truly important."" No one knows what underlying lifestyle, environmental or genetic factors may be driving the rise in cases. While rates of cancers tied to human papillomavirus, or HPV, have been rising in recent years, that virus causes cancers mainly of the cervix, back of the throat and anus, and scientists do not believe sexual behaviors or HPV are driving the increase in colon or rectal cancer (anal and rectal cancers are distinct). Obesity, a diet high in red or processed meats and lack of physical activity are among the factors tied to increased risk, but new research is looking at other possible causes. One recent study found, for example, that prolonged use of antibiotics during adulthood was associated with a greater risk of developing precancerous polyps, possibly because antibiotics can alter the makeup of the gut microbiome. Scientists are also exploring whether the colorectal cancers emerging in younger adults are different from those seen in older people -- and whether they can be detected and treated with the same tools. There is some evidence that young people are more likely to have precancerous polyps that are harder to see and remove during a colonoscopy because of their location in the colon or because they are flat rather than tubular, according to Dr. Otis Brawley, who is chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society.

The findings add to the urgency to find reliable ways to detect colorectal cancer early in young people. Most medical groups have for years recommended people start routine screening only at age 50 unless they have specific risk factors, like a family history of the disease or chronic conditions like inflammatory bowel disease that raise the risk. One organization, the American College of Gastroenterology, recommends that African-Americans start routine screening at 45 because they are at higher risk for colorectal cancer than whites. Any proposal to expand universal screening, however, will be both controversial and potentially costly, since the vast majority of colorectal cancer deaths still occur among older adults. ""I don't know that this very small uptick in mortality means we ought to start doing colonoscopies on 20-year-olds as a routine matter,"" said Dr. Michael Potter, a professor of family and community medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. More lives would be saved by increasing screening at age 50, he said, adding, ""It's worth doing research in this area to determine whether lowering the age of colorectal cancer screening would yield more benefits than harms. These are not risk-free procedures."" Screening tests are also expensive, though cost is not the driving issue. Looking for colon cancer in young people is like looking for a needle in a haystack -- you'd have to screen a lot of people to detect even a small number of cancers or precancerous polyps. Most young people would go through the process for no good reason, and some would sustain injuries or other harms. Complications from colonoscopy, considered the gold-standard test, are fairly frequent. A study of over 300,000 healthy Medicare patients who had colonoscopies found that nearly 2 percent wound up in an emergency room or hospital within a week of the procedure because of complications such as tears in the wall of the colon or rectum, which can be life-threatening. But while some organizations specifically state that colonoscopy is the preferred screening method, the United States Preventive Services Task Force endorses a variety of screening tests, including some that are less expensive or noninvasive, though they may not be as effective in finding and preventing cancers. Stool tests that examine fecal samples for microscopic amounts of blood and DNA changes, for example, can indicate the presence of a tumor or polyp, but such tests need to be done more frequently and may have to be followed up with a colonoscopy if the result is positive. All of the testing options have pros and cons, and some may yield a false positive test, subjecting someone to additional testing for no reason, or a falsely reassuring negative result.

But Dr. Brawley said there is good scientific data to show that stool sample tests save lives, and added that some patients may be better served by these noninvasive tests. ""In the U.S., we have all gravitated toward the new high-tech screening methods, and we may be leaving old technology that is still very good,"" he said. Screening guidelines aside, people concerned about colorectal cancer at any age should talk to their doctor, said Dr. Douglas Owens, vice chairman of the Preventive Services Task Force. ""There are always circumstances in which individual decision making is appropriate,"" he said. Many physicians may be reluctant to order screening tests for younger adults, because they are also unaccustomed to seeing this cancer in younger people, Dr. Weber said. He said efforts are being made to raise awareness in physicians as well as patients, adding, ""We need to set the trigger much lower to investigate these symptoms and rule out malignancy."" Warning signs of colorectal cancer include rectal bleeding, bloody stools, unexplained weight loss, fatigue and digestive complaints, or persistent changes in bathroom behavior. Anemia in men is also a warning sign and should be explored further, and while many doctors typically attribute anemia in a premenopausal woman to menstruation, experts say that if a woman is experiencing any other symptoms, doctors should assess her for colon cancer. Make sure you know your family's medical history -- including not only whether any close relatives had colorectal cancer, but whether they had benign polyps, which can be precancerous. Tell your physician of any medical conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, that may increase your risk. Doctors say you may be able to reduce your risk of colorectal cancer if you maintain a healthy weight, get a lot of physical activity, eat a healthy diet, don't smoke and avoid excessive use of alcohol.","Younger Americans aren't just getting cancer diagnoses earlier.

Automobiles,"In Classic Car Auctions, Value Is Subjective",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/06/automobiles/collectibles/in-classic-car-auctions-value-is-subjective.html,"It can be difficult to tell when a classic car is going to make a lot of money at auction and when it will fail to meet the seller's expectations. So much of it is subjective -- a mixture formed of buyer whim, fickle market conditions and black magic. A perfect example of that concept is the one of a kind 1941 Cadillac limousine once owned by the Duke of Windsor to use while he was in New York City. The car's current owner may have figured that by selling it at RM Auctions' Art of the Automobile sale in Manhattan last month, buyers would see that it had had regal owners, a strong connection to the city and a top-notch restoration. Conditions thus, the stars would align and someone would buy it for more than $500,000.

""It has a great story, important owners and a great connection to New York City,"" Mark Hyman, who owns a dealership in St. Louis that specializes in prewar cars, said in a telephone interview. ""How much value can be attributed to the story depends upon how much someone is willing to pay for it. I think the fact that it didn't sell in the auction supports the fact that it isn't worth half a million dollars."" For its part, RM Auctions alluded to the unpredictability of customer excitement on auction day as a possible cause for the disappointing sale.

""With a car of such outstanding provenance, it remains entirely possible for it to sell for in excess of its presale estimate,"" Ian Kelleher, a spokesman for RM Auctions, said in an email. ""We did have a good degree of presale interest, however, it would appear the client level of interest that day was at a different price level."" Despite the current owner's failure to sell, the car -- known as the Duchess -- does have an interesting history. Custom built by Cadillac for the Duke of Windsor and his wife -- for whom he abdicated the crown -- the car is a veritable grab-bag of General Motors innovations, some of which didn't show up on production cars until almost a decade later.

G.M. built the Duchess in that last year before the United States and its industrial powerhouse poured their resources into World War II. Mr. Earl's design team put together a car that was at least several years ahead of its time, and, whether intentionally or not, a harbinger of the styling that was to come to the company's cars during the postwar years. The fenders flow together, a look that did not become popular until nearly 1950. Cadillacs of the era had thick chrome headlamp bezels, but the duke's car had body-color headlamp and indicator light bezels. The smooth look they provided melded well with the gutterless door frames and continuous fender lines. Inside was a humidor for the duke's cigars, a jewelry case, an AM radio with a vacuum-operated retractable antenna, satin curtains and a rack for pipes. The limo also had a custom-assembled V-8 engine, made from the best parts G.M. had in the factory at the time, as well as automatic heating, stabilized independent front suspension and an automatic transmission. According to ""American Cars, 1946-1959, Every Model, Year by Year"" by J. Flory, fully automatic transmissions -- the Hydra-Matic models -- were introduced for upper-end G.M. cars only two years earlier, showing up on Cadillacs as a $125 option. It was a strongly selling feature, but it hadn't yet become standard, even on Cadillacs.

Roy A. Schneider said in his book, ""Cadillacs of the Forties,"" that the Duke of Windsor had paid $14,000 for the one-off Cadillac, or more than $222,000 in today's dollars. That may not sound like much in terms of today's bespoke cars, which often go for upward of half a million dollars, but in 1941, people did not spend that much on cars.

According to RM Auctions, the duke sold the car in 1952, and it made its way to a series of collectors before being acquired by its current owner -- Morgan Murphy -- in 2009. Mr. Murphy had the car restored from top to bottom. Everything, including the tags behind the seats and the markings on the light bulbs, is either original or period correct, and RM says the car's engine runs quietly, idling at 400 revolutions per minute. Regardless of how distinct and how fine it was, the Duchess could not command regal prices. But then, the antique car market can be fickle. ""It's hard to put a number on a car like that,"" Mr. Hyman said. ""This weekend in London, for example, Bonhams sold Ringo Starr's Facel Vega for $550,000. The question posed is how much of that was the car and how much was that Ringo Starr owned it? That's not an easy question to answer; it's open to interpretation.""","The Duke of Windsor's one of a kind 1941 Cadillac limo has a great history and is in beautiful condition, but it wasn't enough to bring $500,000 at auction.",9ffdb914-b180-5dfb-bbed-e59606c57624,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/05/automobiles/05CADILLAC-1/05CADILLAC-1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=337&w=600&s=f92720d6dd29bc63db86daa3266ffd433eacb29cddfdb045b613a08017368cd8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,The Duke of Windsor's one-off 1941 Cadillac limousine is known as the Duchess.,9ffdb914-b180-5dfb-bbed-e59606c57624,N24News/imgs/9ffdb914-b180-5dfb-bbed-e59606c57624.jpg,23
Health,Therapy for Victims of Sexual Violence Shows Promise in Congo,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/06/health/therapy-for-rape-victims-shows-promise.html,"A type of group therapy designed for trauma victims has proved extraordinarily helpful for survivors of sexual violence in Democratic Republic of Congo, enabling women to overcome the shame, nightmares and terrifying flashbacks that had left them unable to work or take care of their families or themselves, researchers report. An article about the therapy, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, is a rare event: a rigorous study of a treatment meant to heal the mental and emotional scars of women in a part of Africa where rape has become a routine weapon of war. Congo, with two decades of civil war, has been called the rape capital of the world by the United Nations. The country has little or no treatment for those with mental health problems. A team of researchers from Johns Hopkins University, the University of Washington in Seattle and the International Rescue Committee brought a type of treatment called cognitive processing therapy to Congo. They adapted the method to treat women who could not read or write, and taught it to local health workers who had a high school education or less. The workers then conducted group therapy sessions in five languages with survivors of sexual attacks who had severe anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. In Swahili, the treatment was called ""mind and heart"" therapy. Hundreds of thousands of Congolese females, from toddlers to grandmothers -- possibly as many as two million, according to one study -- have been raped by rebel fighters or government troops. Notoriously brutal attacks have included gang rapes and penetration with guns, knives and other objects that have torn apart women's reproductive systems and intestines, sometimes beyond repair.

The study included women from 15 rural villages in eastern Congo, an area of rolling green hills and farmland bordered by dense forests where rebels often hide and venture out to conduct raids. Researchers estimate that about 40 percent of the women in the region have been victims of sexual violence. The therapy technique employed in the study has been used successfully with rape victims and others with post-traumatic stress in the United States. It involves teaching people to think rationally about the troubled thoughts, feelings and beliefs that can linger after an attack. For instance, women who were raped often blame themselves. They left a window open. They went out alone. They made eye contact with a man who later attacked them. Their clothing somehow invited the assault. The therapy urges them to question those beliefs. Have women been raped in other circumstances? If so, then how can a woman blame herself? The program is highly structured, based on a manual for counselors, with topics defined for each therapy session and homework assignments for participants.

The group therapy consisted of one individual session with a counselor, and 11 weekly two-hour group meetings. The women's symptoms were assessed and graded three times: before the treatment program, when it ended and six months afterward. Sixty-five percent of the women in group therapy completed all three assessments, as did 52 percent of those who got individual support. The improvement from group therapy was striking, the researchers found. Six months after treatment, only 9 percent of the women who received group therapy still had anxiety, depression or PTSD. By comparison, 42 percent of the women who had individual support still had those problems. Catherine Poulton, an adviser to the International Rescue Committee, said the group hoped to work with the country's Health Ministry to offer the therapy to more women through national health centers. She said her organization also hoped to provide the treatment in other countries where it was needed. One of the treatment's advantages, she said, is that people without university degrees can learn it. Janny Jinor, a clinical social worker who helped supervise the study as part of the Johns Hopkins team, observed some sessions and said that a number of women made striking improvements even before the program was complete. One woman, she said, initially showed up unwashed, her hair uncombed and her clothing dirty. She was in her 50s, and had been raped a few years earlier. Her husband rejected her and began to see other women, and her in-laws wanted little to do with her. But after a few therapy sessions she began grooming herself and wearing clean clothes, and thanked the counselor for helping her to realize that she was an important person. Her family had begun to treat her better, she said.

""She started to shine, and they could see past the woman who was raped, who didn't comb her hair, the one whose fault it was for being raped,"" Ms. Jinor said. The women who received group therapy said it had lifted a huge burden, but they had one complaint, Ms. Jinor said: why hadn't they been given this good treatment sooner? Judith K. Bass, the lead author of the study and an assistant professor in the department of mental health at Johns Hopkins, said: ""It's not like it's a miracle cure. It's not like all these women are running into the streets and dancing. But they can go back into the community."" Researchers have also found that sexual violence at home is not uncommon in Congo, in the form of child molesting and marital rape. ""The rate of sexual violence against women in Congo is staggering,"" Dr. Bass said. Violence in eastern Congo continued during the study, and one participant was killed. Debra Kaysen, another author of the study and an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Washington, said, ""In two of our villages, during most of the trial, the group leaders, counselor and group members were not able to sleep in their homes at night because it was not safe."" She added: ""The fact that we got these kinds of results in those kinds of settings certainly bodes well that we can still treat PTSD even in settings that are quite unstable and even in people with very big, real world problems."" Dr. Bass added, ""If you can do this in Congo, you can do it anywhere.""","A type of group therapy designed for trauma victims has proved helpful for survivors of sexual violence in the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo, researchers report.",ec8e4613-a557-5b60-a09a-de874b399218,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/06/science/congo/congo-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=902&w=600&s=195ae269fb044ac9b63d425577ed5084dbb6f9c1bbdf610638b2c1a9a8e26766&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,A method designed for trauma victims has helped women recover from being raped.,ec8e4613-a557-5b60-a09a-de874b399218,N24News/imgs/ec8e4613-a557-5b60-a09a-de874b399218.jpg,1
Real Estate,"Thornwood, N.Y.: An Unpretentious Place Where Neighbors Know One Another",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/realestate/thornwood-ny-an-unpretentious-place-where-neighbors-know-one-another.html,"Meredith Fasano had her heart set on living in Thornwood, N.Y. It was where she grew up, and where her parents still lived. ""I knew it was a safe community, a good community, with strong schools,"" she said. But she had to wait. Ms. Fasano, 36, works in product marketing in Stamford, Conn. Her husband, Frank Fasano, 37, is an orthopedic physician assistant in Somers, N.Y. Nine years ago, when they decided to move out of their rental apartment in Ridgefield, Conn., and buy a house, Mr. Fasano, a Staten Island native, was appalled by the property taxes in Westchester County. So they landed in Danbury, Conn., where their daughter, now 5, and son, 2, were born. Still, Thornwood beckoned. ""I told my husband, 'I'm going back,'"" Ms. Fasano said. ""'I don't know when, but I'm going back.'""

So they began looking. Aside from Thornwood, they ventured a few miles north to Chappaqua and Mount Kisco, but all the houses they saw needed upgrades. ""I felt that if I had to put work into a house, I'd rather it be in Thornwood than someplace I'm not familiar with and where I don't have family ties,"" Ms. Fasano said. In January 2018, the Fasanos paid $715,000 for a 2,500-square-foot, three-bedroom, split-level house, built in 1970 on an acre. After some renovating, they moved in, in April. ""We live in a cute little neighborhood on a cul-de-sac,"" she said. Their cul-de-sac is a couple of minutes from her parents, who help care for the couple's children. And it is the same street Ms. Fasano's aunt once lived on. ""I used to visit my cousins there,"" she said. ""I tell my kids, 'Mommy used to ride her bike over here.'""

Thornwood is a 1.1-square-mile hamlet in the town of Mount Pleasant, in central Westchester County. Its approximately 4,000 residents are a mix of families like Ms. Fasano's, who have been there for generations, and newcomers, often with young children. They live on leafy streets with a preponderance of first names -- from Linda Avenue to Gerald Place and Allison Lane -- and a few that honor poets, including Milton Drive and Keats Road. While predominantly white, Thornwood's population has some socioeconomic diversity. As James J. Timmings, the Mount Pleasant assessor, put it: ""There are some high-end properties and some lower-end properties, but overall it's pretty solidly middle class."" Carl Fulgenzi, Mount Pleasant's supervisor, said a master plan is being developed to revitalize the town's hamlets. Goals in Thornwood include rezoning to encourage improvements in the grittier commercial areas and adding more sidewalks to boost walkability. The plan should be completed later this spring, Mr. Fulgenzi said, adding: ""You are going to see some major changes within the next five years."" 1 HIGH HILL FARM PLACE | A five-bedroom, five-and-a-half-bathroom house, built in 1928 on 1.24 acres, listed for $1.15 million. 914-490-1928 Just off the Saw Mill River Parkway, in Thornwood's northwest corner, lies a commercial intersection called Four Corners, the site of two gas stations, a restaurant and a Walgreens. Steps away is Town Center at Thornwood, a shopping center anchored by a ShopRite supermarket. A mile and a half from there is the hamlet's second large strip mall, Rose Hill Shopping Center. Otherwise, Thornwood is primarily residential, its sometimes hilly streets lined with colonials, Capes and ranches, many expanded or rebuilt. Rita Longo, an associate broker with Better Homes and Gardens Rand Realty, said parcels are smaller in the western part of the hamlet, where ""you'll find more starter homes.""

Mr. Timmings said Thornwood has nearly 1,400 single-family homes, including two townhouse developments, and 48 two- and three-family homes. The only condominiums are in a 27-unit complex called Kensico Arms, a converted school. There are no co-op or rental buildings. 34 ALLISON LANE | A four-bedroom, three-bathroom house, built in 1968 on an acre, listed for $795,000. 914-772-3526 ""Some people think Westchester is too expensive unless you go farther north,"" said Tara Siegel, an agent at Houlihan Lawrence who works in partnership with Jordie Wilk. ""But Thornwood offers affordable options and a great commute."" Prices start in the $200,000s for condominiums, she said, with modest houses to the west in the $300,000s and $400,000s. Elsewhere, she said, ""a lot of the homes will be in the $500,000s, $600,000s and $700,000s, and there are areas of high-end homes that will go for over $1 million."" Sales of Thornwood's pricier homes have slowed, Ms. Longo said, possibly because of changes in the tax laws. But ""anything under $750,000 is hot,"" she added. ""Inventory is low, and when a home is priced right, it can generate multiple offers, and you can get close to and occasionally over asking."" According to the Hudson Gateway Multiple Listing Service, as of Mar. 4, there were 12 single-family homes on the market in Thornwood, from a two-bedroom, 1,100-square-foot ranch, built in 1956 and listed for $384,500, to a five-bedroom, 5,550-square-foot colonial, built in 1928 and listed for $1.15 million. 62 LAFAYETTE PLACE | A four-bedroom, three-bathroom Victorian, built in 1900 on 0.17 acres, listed for $699,000. 914-582-8652

Residents are part of the larger Mount Pleasant community, gathering at school sports events, the annual Mount Pleasant Day and the Mount Pleasant Community Center, a 12-acre complex with four pools and a branch of the Mount Pleasant Public Library. Diners have choices, including Italian and Asian restaurants, the family-friendly gastro pub The Barley House, and the Thornwood Coach diner. A few miles away, in Pleasantville, cinephiles will find the renowned Jacob Burns Film Center, and nature lovers can explore the 1,425-acre Rockefeller State Park Preserve. Nearly all of Thornwood is served by the Mount Pleasant Central School District, which also serves the hamlet of Hawthorne and portions of the hamlet of Valhalla and the village of Pleasantville. A small section of Thornwood with about 50 houses is zoned for the Byram Hills Central School District, in Armonk.

Three decades ago, a giant hole gaped near the Four Corners intersection, 600 feet wide and 200 feet deep. It was the ghost of a former marble quarry that began operating in 1845 and became one of Thornwood's first industries. Known as Snowflake Lime Works for the whiteness of its stone, the quarry thrived for decades, supplying marble for the likes of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan and the U.S. Custom House in New Orleans. The quarry ceased operation and was sold in the early 1970s. In 1985, the hole was filled with rocks and paved over. It is now Town Center, where, behind the shops, a vertical wall of stone is a reminder of the past. For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

Economy,A Carbon Tax Could Bolster Green Energy,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/business/economy/a-carbon-tax-could-bolster-wobbly-progress-in-renewable-energy.html,"A couple of years ago, the smart money was on wind. In 2012, 13 gigawatts worth of wind-powered electricity generation capacity was installed in the United States, enough to meet the needs of roughly three million homes. That was some 40 percent of all the capacity added to the nation's power grid that year, up from seven gigawatts added in 2011 and just over five in 2010. But then a federal subsidy ended. Only one gigawatt worth of wind power capacity was installed in 2013. In the first half of 2014, additions totaled 0.835 gigawatts. Facing a Congress controlled by Republicans with little interest in renewable energy, wind power's future suddenly appears much more uncertain. ""Wind is competitive in more and more markets,"" said Letha Tawney at the World Resources Institute. ""But any time there is uncertainty about the production tax credit, it all stops."" Wobbles on the road to a low-carbon future are hardly unique to the United States. In its latest Energy Technology Perspectives report, the International Energy Agency noted that the deployment of photovoltaic solar- and wind-powered electricity was meeting goals established to help prevent temperatures from rising more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above the average in the preindustrial era, the limit agreed to by the world's leaders to avoid truly disruptive climatic upheaval.

In the same report, however, the organization noted that other technologies -- bioenergy, geothermal and offshore wind -- were lagging. And it pointed out that worldwide investment in renewable power was slowing, falling to $211 billion in 2013, 22 percent less than in 2011. These wobbles underscore both the good news and the bad news about the world's halting progress toward reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that are capturing heat in the atmosphere and changing the world's climate. The good news is that humanity is developing promising technologies that could put civilization on a low carbon path that might prevent climate disruption. These technologies allowed the Environmental Protection Agency to pass new rules aimed at achieving a 30 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from American power plants by 2030, compared with 2005. They allowed President Obama last week to promise that the United States would curb total greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025 -- a big step that, White House officials say, can be achieved without further action from Congress. And they allowed China to commit to start cutting emissions after 2030.

The bad news is that civilization is mostly not yet on such a low carbon path. While promising technologies to get there have been developed, it is unclear whether nations will muster the political will and mobilize the needed investments to deploy them. New energy technologies have become decidedly more competitive. The United States' Energy Information Administration projects that the levelized cost of onshore wind energy coming on stream in 2019 -- a measure that includes everything from capital costs to operational outlays -- could be as little as $71 per megawatt-hour measured in 2012 dollars, even without subsidies. This is $16 less than the lower cost projection four years ago for wind energy coming online in 2015. Similarly, projections for the levelized cost of energy from photovoltaic solar cells have tumbled by more than 40 percent, much faster than the cost projections of energy from coal or natural gas. Challenges remain to relying on intermittent energy sources like the sun or the wind for power. Still, experts believe that hitching solar and wind plants to gas-fired generators, and using new load management technologies to align demand for power with the variable supply, offer a promising path for aggressively reducing the amount of carbon the power industry pumps into the atmosphere, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of the nation's total carbon dioxide emissions.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions. And new Energy Information Administration projections to 2040 show prices for renewables falling even lower. By then, electricity from photovoltaic solar plants could be generated for as little as $86.50 per megawatt-hour, without subsidies. In some areas wind-based plants could produce it for as little as $63.40. Nuclear energy is also becoming more competitive. Without any subsidies, new-generation nuclear power coming on stream in 2040 could cost as little as $80 per megawatt-hour, all costs considered. This is only marginally more expensive than electricity produced with coal or natural gas, even without the added cost of capturing the carbon dioxide. And there are much more optimistic cost assessments out there than the Energy Information Administration's.

But for all the optimism generated by cheaper renewable fuels, they do not, on their own, put the world on the low-carbon path necessary to keep climate change in check. Progress is faltering on several fronts. The precipitous fall in the prices of photovoltaic cells from 2008 to 2012 pretty much stopped in 2013, after rapid consolidation of the industry. The International Energy Agency now projects that installed global nuclear capacity in 2025 will fall 5 percent, to 24 percent below what will be needed to stay on the safe side of climate change. And carbon capture technologies, which will be essential if the world is to keep consuming any form of fossil fuel, remain hampered by high costs, meager investment and scant political commitment. ""The unrelenting rise in coal use without deployment of carbon capture and storage is fundamentally incompatible with climate change objectives,"" noted the International Energy Agency in its Technology Perspectives report. Despite the falling costs of renewable energy in the United States, the Energy Information Administration's baseline assumptions project that in 2040 only 16.5 percent of electricity generation will come from renewable energy sources, up from some 13 percent today. More than two-thirds will come from coal and gas. Without some carbon capture and storage technology, drastic climate change is almost certainly unavoidable. What is necessary to get us on a safer path? White House officials trust that the administration has the tools, including fuel economy and appliance efficiency standards, the Environmental Protection Agency's new limits on power plant emissions and regulations to limit other greenhouse gases. Yet the Energy Information Administration's projections suggest how hard the task will be. Though they were developed before the Environmental Protection Agency issued its new rules, they included hypothetical outlines that could mimic some of its effects. In one, coal power plants were decommissioned more quickly; in another, subsidies to renewable energy were kept until 2040. In another, the price of renewables fell faster than expected. None of them did much to move the carbon dial.","Despite technological innovations, investment in alternative power generation is lagging. But one tool could trim carbon emissions on a meaningful scale.",84e4d28e-5e8c-5f80-b13c-de8da7e5b444,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/19/business/Porter/Porter-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=5cc4ac35486b1597f1b236bd018d7d744f4b80dc2ff2f5ad1e99fd2de9c89237&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Construction of carbon capture equipment in July at a Southern Company energy plant in Kemper County, Miss.",84e4d28e-5e8c-5f80-b13c-de8da7e5b444,N24News/imgs/84e4d28e-5e8c-5f80-b13c-de8da7e5b444.jpg,8
Science,How to Decide Whether Ailing Chimps Get Moved to a Sanctuary,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/science/ailing-chimps-sanctuary.html,"Faylene is a 35-year-old chimpanzee now housed at the Alamogordo Primate Facility in New Mexico. She is owned by the National Institutes of Health, along with 50 or so other chimpanzees there, most of whom have been used in biomedical research. The N.I.H. decided in 2015 that all federally-owned or supported chimps would be transported to sanctuaries, which would seem to make pretty clear the future of about 270 chimps (as of March) it still owns or supports outside of sanctuaries. But nothing has been simple since the government first started seriously questioning the value of research in chimps in 2011. Gradually, in a series of steps, they first banned new biomedical research and then stopped all biomedical research on all N.I.H. chimps in 2015. That same year the Fish and Wildlife Service declared all chimps, even those in captivity, endangered, effectively banning all invasive research on all chimps, whoever owns them. Numbers change as chimps move to sanctuaries and die. But the N.I.H. census as of Jan. 1 counted 130 federally-owned chimpanzees still housed at the Michael E. Keeling Center for Comparative Medicine and Research in Bastrop, Tex., and 79 federally-supported chimpanzees remaining at the Southwest National Primate Research Center in San Antonio. It counted 79 at Alamogordo, but at least 23 of those have since moved to a sanctuary.

The latest twist in the seven-year saga of changing the federal approach to chimpanzees in research is the question of whether chimps in ill health should be moved at all, or stay where they are, retiring in place. Earlier this month, the N.I.H. Council of Councils, a title that deserves some sort of award for cryptic naming, approved a working group report on the question. James Anderson, the N.I.H. director for program coordination, planning, and strategic initiatives, said the working group was established in the first place because of the need for a common framework to deal with moving old and ailing chimps. Each lab or facility had its own method for assessing chimp health, but the report sets out common criteria. The problem the N.I.H. faces, he said, is, ""O.K., we're going to move all these chimps. But we don't want to kill them,"" in the process. The chimps suffer from age-related diseases like diabetes and heart problems, and also from the effects of the experiments they were part of, infection with viruses, for example, although the lasting effects of those infections is hard to pin down. About 7.5 percent of the chimpanzees owned and supported by N.I.H. die each year, he said. The report urges, once again, that all chimps should be transferred to sanctuaries, unless such a move is ""extremely likely"" to shorten their lives. The council forwarded the report to the director of the N.I.H. There will be a 60-day public comment period and Francis Collins, director of the N.I.H., will likely make a final decision on the recommendations in September.

This news might seem to be no news at all, in the sense that the movement of chimps to sanctuaries will continue along as it has been, with, it would seem, rare exceptions. But there are details to be worked out, and the fact that the working group was established at all indicates a deep difference in opinion about what a good end of life is for captive chimpanzees. Simply put, one side thinks that many chimps may be better off where they are, largely because of high-quality veterinary care, and the potential stress of the health exams and transportation involved in a move. The other side holds that the relative freedom of a sanctuary like Chimp Haven, with outdoor spaces for most of the chimps to roam and more natural social grouping, is better even if the chimps have a short time to live. The difference is both philosophical and practical. Animal welfare activists, like Laura Bonar of Animal Protection of New Mexico, see the issue as the same as end-of-life care for human beings. Ms. Bonar has been one of the leaders in the effort to stop experimentation on chimpanzees and move them to sanctuaries.

""I don't see anything that should preclude any of those chimpanzees from being transferred,"" she said. And, she added, the report of the working group ""is just looking at the risk. What about the benefits?"" Veterinarians in research labs see things differently. Charles River Laboratories, which runs the Alamogordo facility under a contract with the N.I.H. referred me to the N.I.H. for any and all questions. But at a recent visit to the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, I talked to Joyce Cohen, a veterinarian and associate director of animal resources there, who is not involved in the N.I.H. process because Yerkes owns its chimps. She argued that the care of chimpanzees at Yerkes and other research institutions has many benefits. In a recent email, she followed up on those comments. ""Based on my knowledge of research centers and sanctuaries that care for chimpanzees,"" she wrote, ""the differences in housing between the two settings are limited."" And she emphasized the quality of veterinary care at research institutions, including easy access to specialists. She wrote, ""The decision of whether to transfer a chimpanzee to a sanctuary or choose to retire it in place should be based on its individual veterinary, social and behavioral needs."" The labs that once experimented on chimpanzees do so no longer, and the facility at Alamogordo has been run for years for chimps who are essentially retired. But it lacks the outdoor spaces of Chimp Haven and Ms. Bonar said there are important aspects of the sanctuary, like materials to create nests each day, expanded social groups, and a fundamental commitment to the well-being of the chimps.

She said she saw an ethical imperative to take even ill chimps to a sanctuary that was not addressed by the working group, which was asked only to look at the effects of a transfer on ailing chimps. ""All of these chimpanzees were bred and put through torture and torment by humans,"" she said. ""Where is the piece about what is owed to these individuals who have never had a chance at what a normal life would look like?"" Ms. Bonar has sought documents on the Alamogordo chimps under the Freedom of Information Act. She sent me a copy of a July 6, 2017 email to Sheri Hild, an administrator at the N.I.H. from a Charles River employee (the name was redacted), that listed 57 chimps as ineligible for transfer because of health reasons. Faylene was one of them, because of her age and high blood pressure and a uterine mass. It would seem that the new guidelines would allow her to be moved, but as one of the participants in the recent N.I.H. council meeting noted in a comment on the report, the criteria are not exact. Paul Johnson, director of the Yerkes primate center, raised a concern about the phrase ""extremely likely to shorten their lives."" He thought it was ""not clear what extremely likely means,"" and suggested it be replaced with something like, ""at significantly increased risk for transfer based on standardized risk assessment criteria."" What that would mean for Faylene is still an open question.","A new report suggests that federally owned or supported chimps should go to sanctuaries unless the trip is ""extremely likely to shorten their lives.""",3016a49e-1370-5541-b35b-d1efa1018db2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/29/science/29SCI-CHIMPS1/29SCI-CHIMPS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=035b43bd019dbd583edf715fdcf8338a5eee9d2fd6a1c56a4be4c0949d5fb8b5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sandy was a lab chimp, now retired at Chimp Haven in Keithville, La.

Style,Down on the Farm With Isabella Rossellini,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/style/down-on-the-farm-with-isabella-rossellini.html,"""Pinocchio, basta! I see you!"" Isabella Rossellini was scolding her spotted mutt, hoping to keep him from mauling a hen that had strayed from her coop. Can't take your eyes off them, can you? Ms. Rossellini was shaking her head, her watchfulness maternal. These days, when she is not acting, writing, making films or modeling -- she recently signed a new contract with Lancome, the cosmetics company -- she is minding her Long Island farm. On a 28-acre tract in Bellport, N.Y., with the help of some friends, she breeds chickens, grows organic vegetables and produces honey and eggs. She doesn't mind getting her hands dirty. After leading visitors to a hillock that turns out to be a compost heap, she plunged a fist deep inside, urging us to do the same, so that we could feel the heat generated by its rotting leaves. It doesn't bother her either to scatter dried worms to the turkeys and 100-odd heritage chickens that trail her wherever she goes. ""When they are small, I sit with them in their boxes,"" Ms. Rossellini said of her oddly speckled and spotted brood. ""That way they get used to me.""

She meant ""My Chickens and I,"" a slim volume of poultry lore published in March. Illustrated with photographs by the artist Patrice Casanova (a friend and neighbor), and her own pleasingly daft line drawings, it documents the maturing of her first chicks from the time they arrived, huddled in boxes, until they started laying eggs. The book is simultaneously whimsical and blunt, like Ms. Rossellini herself, who discusses her roller coaster career with uncommon candor. As she tells it, she was hot, with no fewer than 23 Vogue magazine covers to her credit, riveting film roles and a long-term, lucrative modeling contract with Lancome. Then she was not, the casualty of a youth-fixated culture, as perishable a commodity as her gaily feathered flock.

""Now I'm hot again,"" Ms. Rossellini said without rancor. Indeed, at 65, she is having a moment, her farm a physical manifestation of her oddly assorted passions. ""Nobody wanted me as a model or actress, so I went back to school,"" she said matter-of-factly. Yet, despite a yearslong hiatus in her performing career, she has kept busy with several wittily instructive films, among them ""Green Porno,"" a 2008 Sundance mini-series about the mating behavior of animals, and the 2013 ""Mammas,"" an alternately absurd and scary short describing variations in maternal instinct among the species. Ms. Rossellini appeared as a spider that gobbles her young.

Now, she is about to complete her master's degree in animal behavior and conservation at Hunter College in Manhattan. She is acting again, playing the matriarch of a Romani-American crime dynasty in ""Shut-Eye,"" a two-season series on Hulu. She will direct and perform in Link Link Circus, a touring ""theatrical lecture,"" as she calls it, highlighted by her funny, perceptive observations on evolution and barnyard life; it opens May 16 at the Baryshnikov Arts Center in New York. Her book is just another way to show off her inventiveness. Populated by her varicolored chickens, it draws on her observations about their diversity and intelligence. There are comic riffs as well on poultry plumage, a kind of critter couture in Ms. Rossellini's view. A Cochin hen with fluffy tail feathers appears alongside Ms. Rossellini's drawing of a tutu-clad mannequin.

""This one reminds me of Dior's New Look,"" she writes. On this first in a string of balmy spring days, Ms. Rossellini wore a weathered toggle-jacket by Shanghai Tang over torn pants. ""There are always holes in my clothes,"" she said, smiling unabashedly as she strolled the property, which once belonged to the Marist brothers. She chattered, unfazed, above sudden gusts of wind, shrilly gabbling turkeys and the occasional cricket-like ringtone of her phone. Sighting a turkey, she stopped in her tracks. ""See that,"" she said. ""He does a domineering dance. He is like a man, lording it over the other birds."" His flashy posturing once prompted a visiting professor to suggest that the animal may have been courting her, Ms. Rossellini recalled. ""The males can be very aggressive, you know,"" she said. That comment was unambiguous, but Ms. Rossellini seemed reluctant to venture further into highly charged terrain. In her 1997 memoir, ""Some of Me,"" she referred glancingly to having been raped as a teenager by a slightly older boy. A feminist who attended consciousness-raising groups in her native Rome, she has no quarrel with the #MeToo movement. But she tends to stop short of airing her personal traumas, and declined through her publicist to revisit the rape.

In a ""machista"" culture, she went on, ""a lot of men are told that if women say no, they mean yes."" There are other erroneous assumptions, she said the other day, including that women dress and make up entirely to provoke or seduce, that they dream of eternal youth. It was precisely that sort of thinking that led Lancome to fire her a couple of decades ago. At the time the company was run by a closed tribe, what she described as ""men of middle age in a very paternalistic culture."" The loss of that job, and with it her chief source of income, shook her. ""I was depressed,"" she said. ""I was worried financially."" She remembered asking a company executive: What am I supposed to do? ""I'm not your wet nurse,"" he replied. A more progressive era dawned with the arrival last year of Francoise Lehmann, Lancome's 55-year-old motorbiking general manager. She quickly persuaded Ms. Rossellini to rejoin the fold -- part of a move toward inclusion, not just of skin color but also of age.

Spinning narratives is her business, after all -- ""actors are storytellers,"" she likes to say -- her own tales often underscoring a conviction that no creature, hairy or quilled, is disposable. It's a precept that covers her Long Island menagerie, which includes, besides poultry and bees, three goats, a small herd of sheep and Pepe and Boris, her lumberingly overgrown pigs. Bred for slaughter, they have legs that are too short to carry them far. ""You can see that they suffer,"" she said. But letting them loll in their shed is preferable to carting them off to the slaughterhouse. By contrast her goats work a little. ""We let them out,"" Ms. Rossellini said. ""They eat a lot of weeds."" The farm, which she created with the Peconic Land Trust, is a boon to the community. Children sometimes visit in school groups or with their parents. ""Their mothers are delighted to show them, 'This is how asparagus grows. This is what eggs look like.'"" Not a moment too soon, it would seem. ""Some of these children,"" Ms. Rossellini noted wryly, ""don't even know where an egg comes from.""","The actress, model, author and filmmaker turns her hand to breeding chickens.",9b2d4d62-e58c-5168-8a50-1c406e95df1f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/10/fashion/10ISABELLA1/10ISABELLA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=525e0f1e00060662c8b5ecefd5ba3aaee9145b48d63435ffb95a128cb1b673a7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Isabella Rossellini on her farm in Bellport, N.Y.",9b2d4d62-e58c-5168-8a50-1c406e95df1f,N24News/imgs/9b2d4d62-e58c-5168-8a50-1c406e95df1f.jpg,15
Health,Drug Giants Close In on a $50 Billion Settlement of Opioid Cases,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/health/opioids-settlement-distributors.html,"CLEVELAND -- The nation's three largest drug distributors and two manufacturers have agreed with multiple states on a framework to resolve thousands of opioid cases with a settlement worth nearly $50 billion in cash and addiction treatments, according to three people familiar with the negotiations. The agreement would release AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson Corporation, which together distribute about 90 percent of the country's medicines, along with Johnson & Johnson and Teva, the Israel-based manufacturer of generic drugs, from a rapidly growing list of more than 2,300 lawsuits that they face in federal and state courts. Although the states have agreed in principle to the framework, cities and counties across the country have not yet fully embraced it, said lawyers for a committee that represents thousands of municipal governments. They are seeking more information about how the money will be distributed, whether it will be directed to relief measures or end up in general funds for state legislatures, and ""when they could expect the financial support to start,"" the lawyers said in a statement. All the parties are under extreme pressure to reach a deal by Monday, when opening statements are set to begin in Cleveland in the first federal trial to determine responsibility for the opioid epidemic, which has led to 400,000 deaths in the United States over the past two decades.

Some of the largest drugmakers, pharmacy chains and distributors have been fighting with state and local governments in the courts for nearly two years, as the nation searches for accountability for one of the worst public health crises in America's history. The three drug distributors and Teva are defendants in the first trial, brought by two Ohio counties. With thousands of similar governmental lawsuits on the national runway, the Ohio suit is considered an important showcase that will test the strength of both sides' witnesses and legal arguments before 12 jurors. The drug distributors are not nearly as well known as some of the other corporate players implicated in the opioid crisis, like Purdue Pharma, whose misleading marketing of the drug OxyContin is thought to have set off the epidemic. But the distributors are bigger and richer than the manufacturers -- all three are among the top 20 companies in the United States by revenue -- and numerous lawsuits have pointed to evidence that they routinely evaded regulators and helped pharmacies and manufacturers circumvent limits on orders of opioid painkillers. Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the trial starting Monday have said that the distributors conspired through their trade organization to flout the federal law, which obliged them to monitor sales and report outliers. They said that the distributors not only cast a blind eye on extraordinary orders, but lashed and rewarded their teams to sell greater volumes of opioids. In New York State alone, the distributors sold 1.6 billion oxycodone pills to pharmacies between 2010 and 2018. It was distributors, said the office of Attorney General Letitia James of New York, who ""jammed open the floodgates.""

The companies either did not respond to messages or declined to comment. The distributors have said they were simply delivering medication that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and prescribed by doctors. Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas are leading the settlement talks for the states, along with lawyers for thousands of cities and counties whose cases are in federal court. According to people familiar with the talks, the combined value of the deal breaks down as follows: $20 billion to $25 billion in cash to be divided among the states and localities to help pay for health care, law enforcement and other costs associated with the epidemic; and another $25 billion to $30 billion in addiction-treatment drugs, supplies and delivery services. Many details are still being debated, including the timetable for when the money would be paid, people familiar with the negotiations said. Some state and local governments wanted more details about how the companies calculated the total dollar figures on services and addiction-treatment drugs. Whether the amount will be considered sufficient by all the plaintiffs remains to be seen. A new report by the Society of Actuaries projects that the costs related to the opioid epidemic -- including health care, child and family assistance programs, criminal justice activities and lost wages -- will hit $188 billion in 2019 alone. ""It's not an accident these offers are coming out on the eve of trial,"" said Abbe R. Gluck, a professor of health policy and law at Yale Law School. ""But I think the question will be if this number is going to be enough to get a sufficient number of local governments to sign on."" People familiar with the talks said that one sticking point in the negotiations is how much money will go toward attorneys' fees for the private lawyers who represent governments in the overwhelming majority of cases and work on contingency.

Those lawyers filed the first opioid lawsuits in 2014 and have since conducted hundreds of depositions and compiled many millions of documents. This proposed deal is considerably larger than the tentative settlement negotiated by Purdue Pharma earlier this fall, not least because it involves five large companies instead of one. Under the Purdue agreement, Purdue's owners, members of the Sackler family, would pay between $3 billion and $4.5 billion over seven years. The company would be restructured into a public corporation, with profits from drug sales going toward the plaintiffs. Purdue has also agreed to donate addiction-treatment medication. The Purdue deal is being vigorously opposed by about two dozen states who contend that the Sacklers are not paying enough money and have not yet fully disclosed how much they have earned from OxyContin sales. Johnson & Johnson recently settled with the two Ohio counties for about $20.4 million, but the company is named in many of the other suits, as well. Many drug manufacturers and pharmacy chains also have been named as defendants in federal and state opioids cases, but they are apparently not involved in these negotiations. On Wednesday, even as negotiations continued, jury selection was underway in the federal courthouse in Cleveland. Because the trial is expected to be heavily steeped in testimony about illegal drug use, addiction, crime and rehab, prospective jurors were interviewed in private in Judge Dan A. Polster's chambers, so that lawyers could determine whether they had a glancing acquaintance with any of those topics.","The nation's three largest drug distributors, as well as two manufacturers, are in intense negotiations to settle thousands of cases before a trial set to begin on Monday.",275d84c3-4267-5936-97de-616cb11b68c9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/16/science/16OPIOIDS/16OPIOIDS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=e6a1782c344e875ad42d678577bcadb084ed877dd20fa2ecf9111ca080c8d58c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"McKesson Corporation's headquarters in San Francisco.

Theater,"Jeremy Pope Says Goodbye to 'Choir Boy,' and Hello to the Temptations",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/theater/jeremy-pope-choir-boy-aint-too-proud.html,"Jeremy Pope, the star of ""Choir Boy"" on Broadway, gave his final bows in the show on Sunday and was in tech rehearsals the next morning for ""Ain't Too Proud -- The Life and Times of the Temptations.""

Jeremy Pope hasn't had a day off in weeks. That tends to happen when you work on two Broadway shows at once. Until last Sunday, the 26-year-old actor had been starring in Tarell Alvin McCraney's ""Choir Boy,"" while also preparing to do the same in the musical ""Ain't Too Proud -- The Life and Times of the Temptations."" The morning after Mr. Pope took his final bows for ""Choir Boy,"" which continues through March 10, he was in tech rehearsals for ""Ain't Too Proud."" He should be very tired -- or at least his voice should be -- but he is maintaining preternatural enthusiasm and energy, both onstage and off. ""I just go day by day,"" Mr. Pope said over breakfast near the Imperial Theater, where ""Ain't Too Proud"" begins preview performances this week. ""I can't give any power to stressing out, because that's when my voice will want to fail out, or that's when I get anxiety over things I have no control over."" [The Broadway shows and more to see in New York City this spring.] If he does let his guard down, it's to talk tenderly about Pharus, his character in ""Choir Boy,"" an endearing high-school singer who is black, queer and full of love for God. In giving his final performance, Mr. Pope was saying goodbye to a role he has carried with him for years: The play's run Off Broadway, in 2013, was his first professional job.

But some things haven't changed. Mr. Pope is as bright-eyed and boyish as when he first played Pharus. And the show's themes and references -- one student is chastised for running his mouth ""like Kanye at a press conference"" -- are as fresh as when they were first spoken in 2013. The final scene of ""Choir Boy"" is, fittingly, a graduation -- a farewell to a phase in Pharus's life, and now Mr. Pope's as well. Over breakfast, he talked about letting go of this role and what the play has meant to him and its fans. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. How are you conscious right now? I'll do the rehearsals, do the show, go home and order food. I'm also on a lot of vitamins. But I feel really good. This season has been all about massages, and a lot of going home, sitting down and watching cartoons: ""The Proud Family,"" a little ""SpongeBob."" My favorite show is actually ""Martin,"" the sitcom from the '90s. Everything is light right now. I feel like, if I think about what I have to do in the coming days or weeks, I'll get overwhelmed.

You were onstage for almost every scene of ""Choir Boy."" Do you get to rest a little in ""Ain't Too Proud""? It's basically the same! I'm still onstage a lot as the Temptations. ""Choir Boy"" had dance and music, but this is a musical. So it's cardio. I do have a microphone now, though. It's so nice to have, and to have a band and background singers, to be supported in that way. It's a cliche to describe a cast as a family, but the one in ""Choir Boy"" is so small, and you guys have to be literally in tune with one another throughout the show. How did it feel to leave that behind? I knew it would be emotional, and I want to remember these moments. I want to remember the anxiety, the excitement. Because I know that I'll blink and it will be over. I hadn't yet processed that I was leaving the show -- leaving my boys. They held my back through everything, and I'm just so grateful to them. Even as a technical aspect, you have to lean on your brothers and their parts when you sing. It built such a strong dynamic between us.

You've mentioned that while developing the production, the cast shared their own stories about how they relate to ""Choir Boy."" What was yours? Back in 2013, when we were in previews I was walking home. It was the night of the Tony Awards; Patina Miller had just won [for best actress in a musical]. Someone punched me in the face, I think because I was wearing a blue polka-dot shirt. It threw me off, having to come into work the next day and do a monologue about being punched -- with a real black eye.

There are certain things about Pharus that have happened to me that I feel, that I know, that I grew up with. I think all of us can relate to being in a barber shop, around that toxic masculinity. I think that's why we have been receiving so many messages from people who saw the show. I realized how important and special and rare it was to see a black gay lead take ownership of a narrative and be the focal point of the night. So many people have shared thank-yous. A fragment of their life was shown. It feels so important for me, Jeremy Pope -- not the actor, but me as a black man. How do you respond to people in the audience who reach out? A lot of them come to the stage door. A lot of times it would just be a hug. Sometimes they would be speechless, still processing what they just saw. We once did a student matinee. A lot of them sent messages saying ""Thank you,"" ""It was so special,"" ""It was so good,"" ""It felt black."" It was just reminders about how important the story is. And it was important to me, no matter how crazy the day was, to just take a minute to throw all that away and show up. Show up for Pharus. His story is too special. What was going through your head during the graduation scene at your last show? It felt like a real graduation. I really took that moment to look out to the audience and make the decision that I feel like Pharus is going to be O.K. You're going to breathe, and you're going to keep going. I got this text from my mom: You gave birth to Pharus, and you allowed him to grow. But now this is you letting him go, and he'll soar.","Without missing a beat, the 26-year-old actor is moving from one Broadway show to another — and leaving behind a role he has owned since 2013.",9bc28803-8d53-5c07-911f-92ca7468f920,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/03/arts/03EXIT-POPE1/03EXIT-POPE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=c49147799f613c7e02e70a6add6eab71d8b5429592183398eacf70ddbc26540a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jeremy Pope, the star of &ldquo;Choir Boy&rdquo; on Broadway, gave his final bows in the show on Sunday and was in tech rehearsals the next morning for &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t Too Proud &mdash; The Life and Times of the Temptations.&rdquo;",9bc28803-8d53-5c07-911f-92ca7468f920,N24News/imgs/9bc28803-8d53-5c07-911f-92ca7468f920.jpg,10
Books,Revisiting the Ponzi Scheme in Mitchell Zuckoff's 'Ponzi's Scheme',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/books/review/mitchell-zuckoff-ponzis-scheme.html,"In this week's issue, Clyde Haberman reviews Mitchell Zuckoff's ""Fall and Rise."" Fourteen years ago, David Margolick reviewed Zuckoff's ""Ponzi's Scheme,"" an account of the life of Charles Ponzi, for the Book Review.

There is another particular subtlety to the classic Ponzi scheme: Not just anyone can pull one off; doing so requires cleverness, charm and charisma. That all these the original Ponzi had aplenty is clear from ""Ponzi's Scheme,"" Mitchell Zuckoff's entertaining portrait of the dapper rogue who persuaded 30,000 people, Bostonians and others, many of them Italian immigrants like Ponzi himself, to entrust him with their hard-earned, pre-inflationary dollars.

Ponzi's investors, it turned out, were not the only dreamers; so, too, was Ponzi himself. Never did he think he was doing anything wrong. Always, he thought he would find a way out of his fix, a way to make everyone whole: taking over a bank, buying into a macaroni company, turning much of the American freight and passenger fleet from World War I into his very own steamship line. With all of its pejorative connotations, ""Ponzi scheme"" may actually be a bit unfair to Ponzi, conjuring up someone who was more mendacious and greedy than the real Ponzi actually was.

Zuckoff, who teaches journalism at Boston University, tells Ponzi's story amicably and briskly, and keeps the complicated financial intricacies understandable. There are occasional bad puns and tortured metaphors, as well as periodic digressions that seem like padding. More serious is his excessive reliance on Ponzi's autobiography. Since so little else of what Ponzi said can be believed, why trust his own version of events? The answer, of course, is that it's just so colorful. Even from his pauper's grave, it seems, Charles Ponzi is still working his charms.","In the 2005 book ""Ponzi's Scheme,"" Mitchell Zuckoff tells the story of Charles Ponzi, who launched a successful and infamous money-swindling scheme in the early 1920s.",000d3d15-7cf0-545c-824c-a53b12d0b860,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/10/books/review/10fromourarchives/10fromourarchives-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=70dab15921d21937f42cdad57314716d7c6bd1af94aa16c942c0b1cb359d697b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An undated mugshot for Charles Ponzi.,000d3d15-7cf0-545c-824c-a53b12d0b860,N24News/imgs/000d3d15-7cf0-545c-824c-a53b12d0b860.jpg,13
Fashion & Style,"Stories From the Neighborhood, Then Goose Bumps",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/fashion/weddings/stories-from-the-neighborhood-then-goose-bumps.html,"Kelly Hayes and John Nordstrom had crossed paths countless times since they were children, but it was only about two years ago that they finally connected. Both had grown up in Middletown, N.J., their homes only 10 minutes apart. And they had a mutual friend, although they were never in that friend's company together. ""She was John's childhood friend, and is in my birthday party pictures as a little girl,"" Ms. Hayes said. ""She lived across the street from my grandparents.""

""Looking back, you would think that Kelly and I would have at least heard of each other,"" Mr. Nordstrom said. ""It's kind of strange."" Ms. Hayes, a pharmaceuticals saleswoman in the cardiology field, married in July 2011. She and her husband lived in a townhouse in Tinton Falls, N.J., where Ms. Hayes met Mary Curtis and Bill Carlone, an older couple who lived next door. They treated Ms. Hayes as if she were family. ""We spent many happy hours on our adjoining back patios,"" Ms. Hayes said. ""Life was good."" Around the same time, Mr. Nordstrom, who works in the financial services industry , specializing in hedge fund administration, had moved to San Diego for a relationship that lasted only six months. He eventually returned to the East Coast to live in Red Bank, N.J. ""It was a time when most of my friends were getting married and having children,"" he said, ""and I wasn't so sure if New Jersey was the right fit for me in terms of my future."" By the spring of 2015, the good life for Ms. Hayes was ending. She was getting divorced, and her neighbors were experiencing major health issues. ""Bill was battling pancreatic cancer and Mary was in the hospital and rehabilitation center recovering from some sort of cardiac-related issues,"" Ms. Hayes said. ""As I'm packing up my house, Bill's health was really deteriorating and Mary could not care for him because of her own health problems.

""I began checking in on Bill,"" she continued. ""I made him dinner, walked his dog, Jimmy, and took him to chemo appointments."" Mr. Carlone died in August 2015, three months after Ms. Hayes, who still keeps in touch with Ms. Curtis, moved to an apartment in Asbury Park, N.J. Ms. Hayes says she tried online dating and went on about 30 first dates ""that just didn't seem like a fit or connection, which was probably just me not being ready for a real relationship."" Despite these frustrations, Ms. Hayes said she ""soon began loving the life I had never expected to live.""

Then one day, when he was 7, he said, he hit a ball that went crashing through the couple's front window, and his mother made him apologize and offer to pay to replace the shattered glass. As Mr. Nordstrom told the story, he described the older gentleman as sweet and mild mannered and having to breathe with an portable oxygen tank. Ms. Hayes asked what street this couple had lived on, and when Mr. Nordstrom said ""11th Street, in the Belford section of Middletown,"" she told him that the man with the oxygen tank was her grandfather.

""John has not had a bad day since he met Kelly,"" said Mr. Nordstrom's father, John Nordstrom, as tears began to fall behind his dark sunglasses. Brenda Hayes, the bride's mother, said that her daughter ""was always leery after her divorce."" ""But the moment John came along, you could see a huge difference come over her,"" she said. ""She was suddenly at ease and very relaxed and so very happy because she knew he truly loved her and cared about her."" The couple were soon standing before the Rev. Dr. Robert Jani, a Universal Life minister, as well as 11 family members and Ben, who served as best dog.

""By divine intervention or the alignment of the planets or by God's amazing grace or just by really good luck, we are here today,"" Mr. Jani said, ""and so the magic begins."" Wedding Attire The bride wore an ivory dress from Tadashi Shoji, along with her great-grandmother's pearls that had been restrung into a bracelet as a wedding gift from her mother. The groom donned a gray three-piece suit and custom cuff links with a compass and their wedding ceremony coordinates engraved, a gift from the bride. Sunflowers in Bloom Guests received packets of sunflower seeds to plant. Sunflowers are meaningful to the couple -- it was the first flower that the groom bought for the bride, not knowing it was her favorite. First Dance The couple chose ""Someone Like You,"" by Van Morrison, for their first dance. The song was played live by the Pour Boys, a New Jersey band. Father Knows Best ""I'm a people person, and I have a very good feel for John, he's very sincere,"" said Stephen Hayes, the bride's father.

Theater,Review: Finding Their Inner Goddesses in 'The Convent',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/theater/the-convent-review.html,"Plays about women's can-I-have-it-all conflicts too often resemble a Crate & Barrel catalog in both decor and decorum. So it's a relief to find that there isn't a sofa in sight in ""The Convent,"" nor even a pouf or a pew. Instead, Jessica Dickey's new drama, which opened on Thursday evening in a handsome, sometimes hysterical production directed by Daniel Talbott at A.R.T./New York, swims vigorously (if then laboriously) against the tide of contemporary domesticity. At first, ""The Convent"" doesn't even seem to take place in the present, let alone in a living room. As we file into seats on either side of the long, narrow playing space designed by Raul Abrego, we see two women in homespun robes sitting in what looks like a medieval cloister, complete with flagstones, plantings and, in evocative projections by Katherine Freer, forever views of lavender and wheat. The illusion of eternity is shattered by the very first (unquotable) words spoken, as a third woman arrives breathless after climbing to the site. We quickly discern that this woman, Jill (Margaret Odette), and the other two, Dimlin (Annabel Capper) and Bertie (Amy Berryman), are contemporary pilgrims who have come to the restored convent, in the south of France, for a weeklong feminist spiritual retreat. Soon, three more -- Tina (Brittany Anikka Liu), Wilma (Lisa Ramirez) and Patti (Samantha Soule) -- show up panting, more or less eager to surrender their unhappiness along with their cellphones. But it will not be so easy, as Mother Abbess (Wendy vanden Heuvel) soon tells them. ""Women cannot follow men,"" she explains; they must in some way follow themselves. ""We could say you are here because a kind of fog has rolled in between you and your leader, and so your life has become frightening, even hostile, disoriented.""

""The Convent"" is in some ways the inverse of that, examining the effect of a sequestered community on a modern calamity. Because the calamity here is women's loss of faith in themselves, Mother Abbess aims to address it through a revamped and female-oriented cosmology. Thus she deals out a Pokemon-like deck of so-called nomen cards that assign to each pilgrim a medieval avatar. At least for the week, mystics including Teresa of Avila, Clare of Assisi and Hildegard von Bingen are assigned to take the place of the women's absent ""leaders,"" teaching each what she needs to know to repair her life. [What's new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter.] It is here that a pall of predictability begins to descend on the plot, as the cast is put through paces that seem prompted by dramaturgical rather than spiritual need. First there are little book reports on the avatars. Then, before meals, the women recite, instead of grace, a statement of their life wishes, both profound and less so. (""I want to be good at high heels,"" Jill says.) Under the influence of sleep deprivation and a mild hallucinogen, they eventually participate in a ritual called Head of Kings, in which each ""sees"" an image of someone who has contributed to a sense of alienation from herself. As the play's structure comes to resemble a reality competition with arbitrary tasks, the six pilgrims likewise come to resemble the cliched characters in a lifeboat story: the innocent, the free spirit, the spoiler, the good girl. (At least they are female cliches.) Their issues start to converge as well, mostly around maternal conflict; it is not much of a surprise to learn that Mother Abbess, who we already know is not really an abbess, is also not much of a mother.

Amid much agony and also ecstasy -- the mountain air is at least good for the libido -- the thread of the play's argument frays. Provocative ideas get raised almost as a bullet-point outline for a deeper work: Are women actually afraid of the independence they have fought for? Must choosing to be true to yourself mean letting ""someone else break""? These questions remain crucial ones to ask, but Ms. Dickey's round-robin structure (and Hail Mary pass of an ending) diminish their impact. In a way, so does Mr. Talbott's deluxe staging, by enhancing the play's conceit at the expense of its characters. (""The Convent"" was produced, its program carefully tells us, by three entities: Weathervane Productions and Rising Phoenix Repertory in association with Rattlestick Playwrights Theater.) The cast does what it can to hold onto the careening story but pretty soon it is only the imagery that seems strong enough to survive. For me, the best moments of ""The Convent"" are thus the quietest ones, often involving Wilma, a nun who has lost track of her calling. She gets at the problem of a specifically female spirituality by posing a question so simple and universal and contemporary it might as well be asked in a living room as a convent: ""If God is a mother, what do you do if your mother dies?""","With the help of fresh air, a Mother Abbess and a mild hallucinogen, six women spend a week in search of a female spirituality.",05a8d04b-8b08-5775-8cfd-68c149718174,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/25/arts/25convent1/25convent1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=021a7f391d3dc142cfb53260a620b6b3656f60f1c17f1d10f9f809c744b3652a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left: Amy Berryman, Wendy vanden Heuvel and Lisa Ramirez in Jessica Dickey's ""The Convent.""",05a8d04b-8b08-5775-8cfd-68c149718174,N24News/imgs/05a8d04b-8b08-5775-8cfd-68c149718174.jpg,10
Opinion,Does China's Propaganda Work?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/opinion/china-coronavirus-propaganda.html,"Not long after it publicly recognized the seriousness of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, the Chinese Communist Party declared war -- a ""people's war"" -- against the epidemic. Since then it also appears to have declared war against any narrative it thinks challenges that endeavor. The party's persuasion efforts are sometimes dismissed as a rigidly ideological top-down affair or a clumsy spectacle, but the government's handling of the Covid-19 crisis has revealed just how agile China's propaganda operations really are: They are interactive, and they readily engage with public opinion -- the better to co-opt it. This, however, is a risky strategy. The party's sophisticated messaging also exposes it to greater demands and more criticism, from the Chinese public and internationally. At home, one of the party's predominant techniques has been to respond, yet only selectively, to people's grievances with both symbolic gestures and practical policies.

Likewise, internationally: While some foreign officials have praised China's aid efforts, others have found it lacking. ""Does China expect Kenya to fulfill its debt obligations in the wake of unparalleled disruption to our economy?"" an editorial in The Standard, a popular Kenyan newspaper, asked last week. Official attempts to appropriate people's views also seem to have invited scrutiny. One post -- which was later censored -- criticized the government's decision to declare April 4 a national day of mourning for the victims of Covid-19. The author argued that the timing was inappropriate because the epidemic was still underway and many questions about accountability remained unanswered. Other people seem to push back against the state's official narrative of strength and heroism by sharing intimate accounts of their searing losses and run-ins with administrative hurdles that scuttled their attempt to grieve with dignity. Consider this post by a resident of Wuhan who lost his father to Covid-19: ""Wuchang morgue just called to verify information with me and relayed the message that I have to wait for a notice from Wuhan's epidemic prevention command post before I can pick you up, Dad. When I think of you alone in the morgue, unable to be buried in peace, I cry uncontrollably."" Since early April, residents of Wuhan have been required to pick up the ashes of their deceased relatives and loved ones accompanied by local officials. The co-optation of foreign voices in the service of China's persuasion campaign hasn't gone unchallenged either. The World Health Organization has been accused of kowtowing to China in various ways, and the hashtag #TedrosResign, referring to the institution's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is gaining traction on Twitter. Some of this, of course, is the result of self-serving counter-propaganda by the Trump administration. (On Tuesday, President Trump announced that the United States would stop funding the W.H.O.) But other states are pushing back as well. China's so-called mask diplomacy has sparked suspicion that it is seeking to extend its political influence abroad. Taiwan and Vietnam have tried to offset that possibility by exporting face masks as well. And so even as some analysts argue that the coronavirus crisis is helping China emerge as a global leader and serious contender against the United States, others claim that the payoff will be limited. While conducting research on public perceptions of China in Ethiopia and Russia over the past two years, I have found many people in both countries who held conflicting thoughts and feelings toward China. One can respect China's might and achievements, while being vigilant about its intentions, especially when it comes to material assistance. Just last week, a Lithuanian journalist asked me about the political risks of accepting Chinese medical aid. China's propaganda has matured -- but so have its targets. Instead of delivering diktat and defensiveness, the government now engages in selective dialogue with its audiences and their criticisms, featuring those views in its own storytelling, or its retelling of them. So far, this seems to have played to the Communist Party's advantage, partly by forcing it to keep adapting its messaging. But the public, in China and abroad, in turn is reinterpreting the propaganda, and further testing the party's agility. Maria Repnikova (@MariaRepnikova) is an assistant professor of global communication at Georgia State University and the author of ""Media Politics in China: Improvising Power Under Authoritarianism.""",The Communist Party's messaging is both more agile and more fragile than it seems.,5743891c-3040-508a-bc90-f8adbdafbaca,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/16/opinion/16repnikova2/16repnikova2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=489a470595bd0d427c654bef98a76cd3f3fb9350e951aff49ebfdd3bc80c1281&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A memorial at Wuhan Central Hospital for Li Wenliang, who died of Covid-19.

Television,"'Succession' Season 2, Episode 8: Bad Rap",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/29/arts/television/succession-episode-8-recap.html,"What's the most horrifying part of Kendall's ""L to the O.G."" rap in this week's ""Succession?"" Is it the way he strips off his suit jacket to reveal an oversized baseball jersey? How about completing the spelling of his dad's name in the chorus with, ""A.N. he playing?"" Maybe it's that hideous plaid baseball cap Ken places on his stone-faced father's head. For a few minutes of TV time, ""Succession"" fans everywhere surely identified with Tabitha, who watches Kendall bust rhymes and says, ""It is burning my eyes but I cannot look away."" To be fair, even if Kendrick Lamar had been onstage, Logan would have been unmoved. In this week's episode, titled ""Dundee,"" the Roy patriarch reluctantly returns to his Scottish hometown to celebrate 50 years in the news business by dedicating a journalism school bearing his name. (""Three thousand miles to pose with signage,"" he grouches.) Throughout the visit, his kids urge him to wax nostalgic, but he won't oblige. He just mumbles that his life story is more complicated than some feel-good rags-to-riches melodrama. He tells Connor that his ""Rosebud"" was a dollar bill -- whatever it took to get him out of Dundee. So when Kendall tries to honor his father's legacy with a wildly inappropriate hip-hop routine, that's really no more or less excruciating than anything else Logan suffers through on this trip. ""Our implacable plaque unveiler,"" as Rhea calls him, does not enjoy or appreciate this hoopla. He looks around at all the memorials to him and to his family, and he sees tiny, shiny tombstones. At least Kendall seems to be enjoying himself -- perhaps because he no longer feels humiliation. Roman, on the other hand, again attempts to make a grand gesture to wow his dad and fails miserably. This latest botch isn't as awful as an exploding satellite launch or inadvertently leaking sensitive information to the Pierce family. But it does sting when he partners up with the Azerbaijani financier Edward to buy the Scottish pro soccer team Heart of Midlothian , only to learn that Logan's actually a lifelong supporter of that team's rival, Hibernian.

With his sons disappointing him left and right -- and with his wife Marcia sniping at him over how much he is letting Rhea guide his decision-making -- Logan turns to one of his most trusty confidants. He calls a truce with Siobhan, mainly so he can commiserate with her about his Rhea problems, and laugh about his dopey sons. What he doesn't realize is that Shiv, stung by the series of betrayals in London last episode, is already working stealthily to weaponize whatever sentimentality remains in her father. The cat-and-mouse game between Shiv and Rhea energizes what is, overall, a very entertaining ""Succession."" When the men in Shiv's life ask whether Logan's affair with Rhea is their business, she is righteously incredulous. (""The business with our name on it? Is it our business?"") She harangues her husband into using his middling powers of seduction on Ms. Jarrell, telling him to be ""not dirty flirty, but hurty flirty"" -- which Tom, predictably and hilariously, does poorly. Siobhan also convinces Kendall to get Rhea to offer a toast to Logan's dead sister, Rose, which they know will annoy him. Rhea counters by cozying up to Ken, hinting that if she's put in charge, he'll remain in the mix to take over someday. She also tells Roman he has ""the best instincts,"" which inspires an all-time great eruption of poetic Roman nonsense: ""I see your thing. It's good. It works. It's like a peppy fun-gun, set to MILF, with like a lean-in woman-y branding that works with the Fitbit moron whatever people."" Rhea, though, can'y see that Marcia has set her up to fail by letting her plan a surprise party Logan will loathe. At the same time, Shiv is using her insider info to assure that Rhea will be in the line of fire when the latest development in the Waystar cruise scandal breaks. When Logan uses his big speech at the party to announce Rhea as his successor, it's in no way a win for Rhea. She just doesn't know it yet. For all of its cringe-comedy and corporate intrigue, what's most surprising about ""Dundee"" is the melancholy tone, cued by Logan's mood. He livens up only while sparring with his brother Ewan, who comes to the various celebrations to remind Logan he's ""a nothing man"" and to tell Cousin Greg to stop working for Waystar or risk his quarter-billion dollar inheritance. (Ewan cites Tacitus to his grandson, who replies, ""Classic Tacitus ... All killer, no filler with him."") Logan tells Greg he would be better off sticking with ""Uncle Fun"" than with ""Grandma Grumps,"" and he bristles at his brother's suggestion that their mother -- who they last saw when there were preschool-aged -- would have disapproved of his journalism.

Mostly though, Logan just appears overwhelmed and wistful, which are notes that Brian Cox plays beautifully. The old man stubbornly refuses to be touched by any of the tributes to him -- regardless of whether they're accompanied by sick beats. When Shiv shows him a scrapbook she made with glossy photos of the houses where they lived, she asks him why he doesn't like the past. He softly answers: ""I do ... It's just there's so much of it. The future is real, but the past? It's all made up."" And she smiles, half-lovingly and half-deviously, knowing a few secrets about what his future has in store. The Rich Are Different From You and Me:
* None In each of these past two episodes, we have learned more about a past Logan Roy fling with a woman named Sally Ann: as in, ""Sally Ann with the horses,"" and ""Sally Ann with the harp."" However long she lasted in Logan's life, she clearly made an impression.
* None Roman drops a lot of marvelously oddball patter in this episode. After casually suggesting to Gerri that they get married, he describes his idea of ""marriage"" as, ""You eat me, I eat you, like they do in Germany."" Later, he blusters his way through a pint and some soccer at a pub with Edward, cheering, ""Sock it in the net-sack you crazy kickball bastards!"" But Roman's greatest offhand remark this week may be the flatulent sound he emits in response to Shiv's concerns about Rhea, which he then reinforces by scribbling the word ""fart"" on hotel stationary and handing it to his sister ... ""In case you want it in writing.""
* None Pour one out for Jennifer (Sydney Lemmon), the actress Kendall becomes smitten with after seeing her in Willa's play, then unceremoniously dumps in Scotland after his dad seems unimpressed. (""You said 'awesome' a lot,"" he laments, right before he ghosts her.) Ken effectively sabotages Willa's production by whisking its star away for a romantic tryst, and then he tosses Jennifer aside, like the batteries he shoplifted from a bodega earlier this season.
* None Connor appears to be having a rough time as the primary backer of Willa's play, ""Sands,"" about ... well, something that involves actual onstage mounds of sand, which may or may not contain sand mites. (""You'll have to talk to the sand supplier like everyone else,"" Connor says when Greg complains about mite bites.) It's no wonder that Shiv rather cruelly compares her oldest brother to ""the first pancake"" -- the one the cook always tosses out.",The Roys travel back to the Scottish town where Logan grew up.

Technology,"In Andrew Yang, the Internet Finds a Meme-Worthy Candidate",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/technology/andrew-yang-internet-democratic-primary.html,"The internet can make you feel like you have all of this control over the political Wait, sorry. How does this -- wait. Did I just lose? ""Internetting with Amanda Hess."" (ALL IMAGES SOURCED FROM THE INTERNET) ""Pokemon Go to the polls."" Hillary Clinton was famously one of the least charismatic politicians. ""I'm just chillin' in Cedar Rapids."" But on the internet, her image took on a life of its own. It's almost as if Hillary's fans breathed charisma into her on social media. Hillary often seemed at her most charismatic in GIF form, when her most charming moments could be put on endless loop and passed around as totems of her character. Meanwhile, Hillary's detractors were working in the opposite direction, isolating moments that made her look deranged, ugly and sick. This is political candidate as avatar. We're no longer just analyzing how candidates express themselves. We want to express ourselves through them. On the internet, our support of candidates is being encoded through these moments where they seem to represent us, not as actual political representatives voting for our interests, but as people acting how we'd like to imagine ourselves acting. ""I'm reclaiming my time, yeah."" Memes put a new twist on the old idea of charismatic authority in politics. Charismatic leaders used to imbue themselves with mythos, claiming to possess special qualities and cults of personality around themselves. But on the internet, a lot of that work has been transferred to citizens who take their leaders' tics and blow them up into superhuman form. And as they do it, they're creating really strong tribal and emotional ties around those personalities. If you make a meme about a candidate and then they become president, it can feel like you created a piece of the presidential persona, like a part of you is president. Memes give us the power to build leaders' personalities or destroy them. We used to talk about gaffes. The idea seems quaint now. ""Grab and grab and grab."" ""Grab and grab."" There's no longer any fixed idea of a candidate to be disrupted by a gaffe. ""Such a nasty woman."" Our conception of politicians is now made up of sets of competing polarized memes. Any moment can be manipulated into a positive or negative, depending on your allegiance. And because memes can morph to accommodate almost any position it's easier than e ver to take candidates' images and twist them to our own ends. Facts don't matter to memes. The meme of this confused blond lady started out as pictures of a Brazilian soap actress contemplating her character's inner turmoil in jail. But when people started superimposing math equations on her face, she turned into a symbol of confusion or deep conspiratorial calculations. The Babadook was a horrifying movie villain before he was pushed in front of a rainbow flag and restyled as a fabulous gay icon. Because memes don't need to grapple with reality, they spread a lot faster than typical forms of political speech. And in presidential politics, we've never seen anyone benefit from this more ""You are fake news."" than Donald Trump. Trump had no clear ideology, the vaguest sketches of ideas, a bottomless thirst for attention, and a flair for drama: the perfect base for endless meming. His campaign rallies became like incubators for ideas with viral potential. Think about the defining meme of Trumpism. ""We need to build a wall."" ""We need to build a wall."" It never made any practical sense that the United States would build a 2,000-mile wall and that Mexico would pay for it, but ""A big, beautiful wall."" Any time reality tried to get in the way, Trump would double down on the meme. ""10 feet higher."" ""The wall just got 10 feet higher."" For his biggest fans, Trump himself is the ultimate meme. They've become so invested in promoting his persona that his promises have become almost irrelevant, like outdated versions of a meme that have been replaced by the next amusing thing. That's the seductive danger of democracy as meme. It can make us feel like we have more personal control over a politician, but it's the politician who is seizing the real power, becoming immune to criticism and less accountable to us.

Fashion & Style,Coalition Brings Pressure to End Forced Uighur Labor,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/fashion/uighur-forced-labor-cotton-fashion.html,"On Thursday, more than 190 organizations spanning 36 countries issued a call to action, seeking formal commitments from clothing brands to cut all ties with suppliers implicated in Uighur forced labor and to end all sourcing from the Xinjiang region of China in the next twelve months. Roughly one in five cotton garments sold globally contains cotton or yarn from the Xinjiang region in northwestern China. There, authorities have used coercive labor programs and mass internment to remold as many as one million Uighurs, Kazakhs and other largely Muslim minorities into model workers obedient to the Communist Party. Camp inmates are forced to undergo job training, and some then take factory positions at little or no pay. ""Many brands have known for years about the growing body of evidence around Uighur exploitation,"" said Peter Irwin, a spokesman for the Uyghur Human Rights Project, an advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. ""They won't stop unethical sourcing practices unless they are faced with real reputational risk and the possibility that consumers will stop shopping from their stores."" Recent investigations by The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Axios and others have found evidence that connects China's forced detention of Turkic-speaking Uighurs to the supply chains of many of the world's best-known fashion retailers, including Adidas, Lacoste, H & M, Abercrombie & Fitch, Ralph Lauren and the PVH Corporation, which owns labels including Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein.

""Until now, there simply has not been enough pressure on big fashion industry names to completely cease ties with factories and suppliers in the Uighur region, an area on which many remain hugely dependent and where there is a huge amount of money on the line, "" Mr. Irwin said. On Wednesday, hours before the call to action was formally announced, a PVH spokeswoman confirmed that the company had agreed to cease all business relationships with factories and mills that produce garments or fabric in Xinjiang, or that supply cotton from the region, within the next 12 months, bringing it line with the new call to action. (The company said this was not in response to this group's request but was an independent decision.) ""Per our policies, forced labor is considered a zero-tolerance issue, and any confirmed instances of forced labor by our suppliers may result in termination of the business relationship,"" the spokeswoman said, adding that the company was in the process of reducing its manufacturing, textile and cotton footprint in China. Signatories to the call to action include the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Human Rights Watch and Anti-Slavery International. The unveiling of the coalition, calling itself End Uyghur Forced Labor, comes days after another Uighur rights campaign focused on the fashion industry, led by a European Parliament member, Raphael Glucksmann, also made headlines. That campaign prompted Adidas and then Lacoste to ""agree to cease all activity with suppliers and subcontractors"" in Xinjiang after they were implicated in a report published in March by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. That report said that local officials are often given targets for the number of people they must provide for state-sponsored labor programs. In Xinjiang, the threat of arbitrary detention in the camps weighs heavily on minority residents, so farmers, traders and idle workers often have little room to resist. The organization also said it found evidence that, from 2017 to 2019, more than 80,000 Uighurs were sent outside Xinjiang to work in factories that produced goods for dozens of multinational companies. (A growing number of Uighurs have been moved from one part of Xinjiang to another, or even out of the region to more industrialized areas in the east, as part of a system of organized labor transfers.)

Many Western fashion businesses have remained quiet when it comes to the Chinese government's stance on local issues, fearful of losing favor in one of the world's most powerful and fastest growing consumer markets or access to a critical manufacturing hub in their supply chains. But on the issue of Uighur forced labor, a change is coming, as is new U.S. legislation. One bill introduced in Congress this spring would make it so that any goods from Xinjiang would be presumed to have been made using forced labor, and that only those for which companies could provide ""clear and convincing evidence"" otherwise could be imported. H & M, for one, said that it did not work with any garment manufacturing industries in Xinjiang. The Swedish retailer said it was reviewing its indirect business relationship with the yarn producer Huafu, which H & M suppliers worked with in other Chinese regions, though they did not source materials from its Xinjiang factory. A spokeswoman also said that, until now, H & M's suppliers had sourced cotton from Xinjiang farms connected to the Better Cotton Initiative, which now does not license cotton from Xinjiang. Abercrombie & Fitch said that it has stopped sourcing materials from Huafu. Fashion supply chain transparency has become a hot topic in recent years, with a particular focus on ""tier one"" factories where the final assembly of garments takes place. But labor abuse and polluting practices are also rife in the raw production of materials and yarn, and are harder areas to audit for Western companies, including in China. Outsourcing labor means a number of companies can be involved in the production of an item. Coerced labor could therefore happen at many points, including during the growing and picking of cotton, the production of thread and fabric, and the manufacturing of the finished item. According to some industry experts, even if more clothing retailers commit to the Xinjiang withdrawal pledge, many will struggle to track the degree to which the production of their goods may be tainted. ""Companies will need to drastically increase their ability to trace their supply chains to origin to understand the risk of Xinjiang-linked forced labor,"" said Amy Lehr, director of the human rights initiative at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who has researched labor in Xinjiang. ""Most cannot do this now.""",More than 190 organizations have come together to demand an end to garments made by forced labor in China.,68aab638-87d6-57ca-b45d-75ba2f9dfc23,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/23/fashion/23UighurCotton/23UighurCotton-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=198447c298d7f352b04ee1feff77257282b4dc55ceeeae4879d752d4006acd5b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A Uighur woman picking cotton in Xinjiang, China. Roughly one in five cotton garments sold globally contains cotton or yarn from the region.",68aab638-87d6-57ca-b45d-75ba2f9dfc23,N24News/imgs/68aab638-87d6-57ca-b45d-75ba2f9dfc23.jpg,19
Books,"Bad Sex in Fiction Award Is Canceled, as 2020 Was Bad Enough",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/books/bad-sex-fiction-award-canceled.html,"For the first time in over a decade, a contest to award the worst sex writing in the English language will not deliver a winner to the public, a relief for readers left mortified by the annual selection and sad news for the world's connoisseurs of cringe.

The Bad Sex in Fiction Award is canceled.

The editors who run the contest announced the decision on Tuesday on the website of their magazine, Literary Review, saying that the year 2020 has been unpleasant enough without their contribution.

""The judges felt that the public had been subjected to too many bad things this year to justify exposing it to bad sex as well,"" the statement said. ""They warned, however, that the cancellation of the 2020 awards should not be taken as a license to write bad sex.""

Staff members for the Literary Review, a British magazine not to be confused with a New Jersey-based publication of the same name, have curated terrible sex writing for almost three decades. The award's purpose, according to the magazine, is to honor the year's ""most outstandingly awful scene of sexual description"" and to draw attention ""to the poorly written, redundant or downright cringe-worthy passages of sexual description in modern fiction.""","Editors of the Literary Review, which has given the award for almost 30 years, said the public had been ""subjected to too many bad things this year to justify exposing it to bad sex as well.""",d0f01ad0-c21d-54ad-b4af-117b6490e7e7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/08/lens/08xp-badsex-photo/08xp-badsex-photo-facebookJumbo.jpg,"The actress Barbara Windsor and the writer Alexander Waugh, the grandson of Evelyn Waugh, announcing the 2011 Bad Sex in Fiction winner, David Guterson.",d0f01ad0-c21d-54ad-b4af-117b6490e7e7,N24News/imgs/d0f01ad0-c21d-54ad-b4af-117b6490e7e7.jpg,13
Well,When the Prescription Is a Recipe,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/09/well/family/when-the-prescription-is-a-recipe.html,"The doctor's office is moving into the kitchen. After years of telling patients to skip junk food and prepare homemade meals, a growing number of doctors and medical groups are now going a step further and teaching them how to cook. Some are building teaching kitchens or creating food pantries right next to their practices. Others are prescribing culinary education programs in hopes of improving their patients' nutrition and overall health. Some medical schools have even introduced culinary curriculums to train more doctors to talk to patients about food. Dr. Nimali Fernando, a pediatrician in Spotsylvania, Va., noticed that many of her patients' concerns could be traced to poor diet -- even problems that may not seem connected, like bed-wetting. She started a food blog, and soon began offering cooking classes out of a church basement kitchen. In 2014 she opened Yum Pediatrics, a nutrition-based pediatrics practice that included a 600-square-foot teaching kitchen. She also created the Dr. Yum Project, a nonprofit with a preschool nutrition curriculum now taught in several Virginia schools. ""I needed to do more than just give patients a pamphlet. I had to have a kitchen in my office,"" Dr. Fernando said. ""I try to give a lot of prescriptions that are just recipes to see if we can fix an issue with food."" Dr. Fernando said she has learned that poor food choices can be the root of many seemingly unrelated issues.

""Sometimes parents say their kids have symptoms of anxiety and are wetting the bed and they feel their child needs to see a counselor or needs medication,"" Dr. Fernando said. But when she asks about diet, it may be that the child is not eating enough fiber, which leads to constipation. And constipation, in turn, can aggravate the bladder, causing bed-wetting. ""That's when you can connect the dots and see how food is often intertwined in their symptoms."" A perk of having a kitchen right next to her office, Dr. Fernando said, is that she can take patients right in and demonstrate something she wants them to try, such as how to grind flaxseed. That costs the patients nothing. But patients pay out-of-pocket for cooking classes, which vary in cost depending on the length. For example, a five-day ""food adventure"" camp for 7- to 12-year-olds costs $125. A popular class on how to make nutritious baby food costs $17.50. Claudia Castro of Stafford, Va., and her daughter Michelle, 14, began taking lessons in Dr. Fernando's kitchen after a blood test showed that Michelle was prediabetic. One of the first recipes Michelle and her mother learned to make in Dr. Fernando's kitchen was for bean burgers.

Michelle lost 10 pounds in a month and is down one dress size. At the Children's Hospital of San Antonio, the Culinary Health Education for Families, or CHEF, program teaches parents and children how to shop, prep and make nutritious meals. Patients must be referred to the program by their doctors, but satellite programs at places like the YMCA are open to the community. Dharti Patel enrolled her 10-year-old son, Rishi, in the program. ""Most doctors would just hand me some paperwork with advice on what to eat and what not to eat,"" Mrs. Patel said. ""They would tell me to just follow what's on the chart. But it did not help."" In the CHEF program, her son learned how to cut up vegetables and fruit and how to make simple chicken and fish dishes, salads with homemade dressing, tostadas and yogurt parfaits for dessert. Ms. Patel said her son now reads nutrition labels when they shop at the supermarket. ""Whenever Rishi eats, now he looks for how many colors we added to the plate,"" she said. ""Now he wants to help us at home when we cook. He was surprised that he liked vegetables after all."" Dr. Julie La Barba, CHEF's medical director and also a pediatrician, said the program was formed out of the concept that ""food could be seen as medicine,"" especially in children. Despite success stories like these, many doctors don't focus on nutrition when they see patients. Only 27 percent of medical schools in the United States offer students the recommended 25 hours of nutritional training, according to the medical journal Academic Medicine. And in a recent study in the American Journal of Medicine involving 930 cardiologists, less than a third described their nutrition knowledge as ""mostly up-to-date"" or better.

Dr. Timothy Harlan, executive director of the Goldring Center for Culinary Medicine at Tulane University, hopes that future doctors see the benefits of adding nutritional education to their treatment arsenal. The center's curriculum has been licensed and is being used at 28 other medical schools. ""What we teach here is how to have a discussion with one's patient about food that can have a substantive impact,"" Dr. Harlan said. ""Physicians will tell you that they have never gotten enough nutrition education. So we sometimes feel underprepared when it comes to nutrition."" Dr. David M. Eisenberg, director of culinary nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, helped start a medical course called ""Healthy Kitchens, Healthy Lives"" to teach doctors to cook. More than 6,000 health professionals have taken the course, which bridges nutrition science, health care and the culinary arts, he said. Rishi Patel, 10, in the CHEF kitchen in San Antonio, Tex., with a plate of fish and a spinach and strawberry salad. ""I would love for teaching kitchens to become as commonplace as gyms, and for access to them to be part of our organized health system,"" Dr. Eisenberg said. In 2014, Harvard's Chan School and the Culinary Institute of America formed the Teaching Kitchen Collaborative, which now has 32 members, including universities, hospitals and companies like Google. Allison Righter, the coordinator of the Teaching Kitchen Collaborative, said it was formed to bring teaching kitchens across varying organizations together to learn about one another's facilities and programs and share best practices.

Boston Medical Center, a member of the collaborative, has a ""preventive food pantry,"" the first of its kind when it opened in 2001. Doctors can write ""prescriptions"" for patients to visit the pantry, which gives them access to healthful food and addresses issues of nutrition-related illness. It also allows low-income patients access to healthy food. ""There are a lot of conflicting impulses out there regarding food,"" said Dr. Christine Pace, an internist at Boston Medical Center. ""We live in a culture that has access to incredibly unhealthy food for very little money."" Doctors are on the front lines when it comes to helping patients change their eating habits, and they should take advantage of that at all levels of medical care, said Dr. Warren Ross, whose primary care practice in Ellicott City, Md., also has a teaching kitchen. ""One would hope that on any medical visit, a doctor would look for an opportunity to see what people are doing around their diet and whether they want additional support in making dietary changes,"" Dr. Ross said. For patients with diagnoses like diabetes or hypertension, a cooking class is billed as an intermediate office visit. Nonpatients can take a class for $60. Dr. John La Puma, who in 2003 taught one of the first classes on culinary medicine at a medical school, now runs Chef Clinic in Santa Barbara, Calif., to prevent and treat obesity and promote wellness. ""I see patients who want to use lifestyle measures to control and treat chronic conditions: obesity, heart disease and high cholesterol. I see people who generally have seen everybody else and are persuaded and motivated that lifestyle -- especially nutrition -- has a great deal to do with their well-being,"" he said.","Doctors, hospitals and some workplaces are showing, not just telling, people how to lead healthier lives by making nutritious food.",c23fd60b-86b4-5f34-abc5-a7ab0dabd195,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/01/science/00FOODMEDICINE1/00FOODMEDICINE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=4db826f910c8affaa045c07f808380459c95bd239477d55aa9d0c98eaad02c90&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dr. Nimali Fernando opened Yum Pediatrics in Spotsylvania, Va., where she can give patients hands-on lessons on nutrition.",c23fd60b-86b4-5f34-abc5-a7ab0dabd195,N24News/imgs/c23fd60b-86b4-5f34-abc5-a7ab0dabd195.jpg,18
Music,The Chicago Symphony's Brass Is World-Famous. Hear It Blast.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/arts/music/chicago-symphony-carnegie-hall.html,"What distinguishes one top-rank orchestra from another? For the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, it's long been the brass. For decades, the ""Chicago brass"" has been prized for its majesty, virtuosity and sheer power. From its modern-day origins under Rafael Kubelik and Fritz Reiner to the brawny blasts of the Georg Solti era to the subtler approaches taken by Daniel Barenboim and now Riccardo Muti, brass has long been central to the ensemble's sound. ""The Chicago brass: This was a way of referring to the Chicago Symphony even when I was a young student in the conservatory in Milano,"" said Mr. Muti, 78, who is in his 10th season as music director. Mr. Barenboim, Chicago's conductor from 1991 to 2006, said: ""When you become music director of a great orchestra, you have to be able to recognize what belongs to the orchestra: what is characteristic -- what is the stomach of the orchestra -- and what is the influence of other conductors. And the Chicago brass was part of that stomach, of that unique way of playing.""

Both newcomers grew up listening to, and trying to emulate, the Chicago sound. Now, they are joining colleagues steeped in the orchestra's traditions: Jay Friedman, 80, has been principal trombone since 1965, and Gene Pokorny, 66, principal tuba since 1989. Whether the Chicago brass would be recognizable in a blind test is open to debate -- many of the regional styles that once differentiated orchestras have been sanded over in this age of jet-setting maestros and more peripatetic players -- but it is still considered one of the jewels of the orchestral world. [Read about the still-unique sound of the Vienna Philharmonic.] After a rehearsal on Friday, several brass players gathered backstage at Carnegie to listen to some classic recordings.

""That's what's made the Chicago Symphony brass unique: that sound jumping out of the horn,"" Mr. Friedman said as he listened to Rafael Kubelik's recording of Smetana's ""Ma Vlast,"" made in 1952. The recording features two of the architects of the Chicago sound: Arnold Jacobs, its principal tuba from 1944 to '88, and Adolph (""Bud"") Herseth, its principal trumpet from 1948 to 2001. Both men overcame physical impediments to dominate their fields. Mr. Jacobs's lung capacity was sharply reduced by various ailments, so he developed breathing techniques that he passed on to generations of players. (""We want as little tension in the body as we can get, so the torso becomes a resonating chamber,"" Mr. Friedman said, summing up the Jacobs technique.)

And Mr. Herseth, a virtuoso who effectively led the brass section for more than half a century, was in a car accident in 1952 in which he broke teeth and damaged his lip -- potentially disastrous for a trumpet player. ""He didn't know if he was ever going to play again,"" Mr. Friedman said. Mr. Pokorny called the two men ""the bookends"" of the section, which was joined by Mr. Friedman in 1962, then by Dale Clevenger as principal horn in 1966, a position he held until 2013. The old sound is still alive in the orchestra -- and not only stylistically.

The first time Mr. Cooper heard Georg Solti's 1971 recording of Mahler's Seventh Symphony, he said, was on an iPod while snowboarding. ""I was just bombing down the mountain, and I was like, yeah!"" said Mr. Cooper, who noted that, in addition to its thrilling power, it also captures the delicate, varied phrasing of Mr. Clevenger's horn playing. ""I've never been more pumped. Just so much energy behind it.""

Solti was famous for pushing for a big brass sound -- sometimes too big. ""When Solti came, at first he could not get the brass section to play loud enough for him,"" Mr. Friedman recalled. ""Even on a Schubert symphony."" Mr. Pokorny recalled a violist in the orchestra, Max Raimi, joking that some Solti recordings ""reduced the string section to tape hiss."" But after critics began to complain, Mr. Solti dialed it back, in what Mr. Friedman called ""the great diminuendo."" Near the end of Solti's tenure, he said, a recording of Verdi choruses was stopped when the recording engineer had a novel complaint: He couldn't hear the brass.

""You can hear all the attacks,"" Mr. Batallan said, referring to the decisive way each note is struck in Leonard Bernstein's 1988 recording of Shostakovich's Seventh Symphony. ""It's a pure sound, with a clear attack."" Mr. Pokorny said that when he started in Chicago, one of his first conductors was a guest, Leonard Slatkin, for whom he had played in the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra. ""I went to him,"" Mr. Pokorny said, ""because he knew the Chicago sound, and he knew the St. Louis sound, and I said, 'What do I have to do to my St. Louis sound to match here?' And he said that what you really have to do is put a lot of front-end on the note."" ""It's more attack, and less follow-through,"" added Mr. Pokorny. ""It's probably a product of the hall"" -- Orchestra Hall in Chicago -- ""more than anything else, because the hall is pretty dead. And he proved to be right.""","As the orchestra's storied brass section breaks in two young musicians, listen to what has made it so renowned.",a2ee6e7d-37de-5feb-b32c-6e05ee00f7c5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/19/arts/18brass1/18brass1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=d303a0a8ba69ae985134f5a3f7b48b319eebb9ebe0c2a4c1eb636f05b051199f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Chicago Symphony's principal brass players, a mixture of new and old: Esteban Batallán, trumpet; Gene Pokorny, tuba; Jay Friedman, trombone; David Cooper, French horn.",a2ee6e7d-37de-5feb-b32c-6e05ee00f7c5,N24News/imgs/a2ee6e7d-37de-5feb-b32c-6e05ee00f7c5.jpg,12
Travel,"Sahara-Level Sand Dunes, Mediterranean-Blue Water: Welcome to Michigan",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/travel/sahara-level-sand-dunes-mediterranean-blue-water-welcome-to-michigan.html,"The Dune Climb is one of the most popular things to do in a remarkably beautiful, off-the-radar corner of northwest Michigan called Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Yet it had me suffering like a modern-day Sisyphus on a June afternoon. With each oxygen-sucking, uphill step, I slipped and slid backward on the sandy slope. My lungs burned, my bad knee ached, I was drenched with sweat -- and I was only halfway to the top. For locals, the sandy clamber is a childhood rite of passage. ""Our mom would take us there to tire us out,"" a friend told me, ""while she lounged in her beach chair and drank Tab."" And on this day, kids galloped past me and rolled down the 300-foot dune, their squeals as high-pitched as the cries of the herring gulls overhead. For visitors like me, the steep climb was a way to dig into the park's quintessential feature: sand. The park has a plethora of the stuff, from 35 miles of beaches to ""perched dunes"" towering 450 feet above Lake Michigan -- part of the state's 275,000 acres of sand dunes, which help make up the largest freshwater dune system in the world.

For all the park's odd, otherworldly beauty, it can be reached year-round via a short flight from Chicago (In summer, there are direct flights from several major airports). Yet, like many lifelong Midwesterners, I'd never heard of it until a few years back, when it garnered headlines after ""Good Morning America"" viewers voted it Most Beautiful Place in America. Even as I triumphantly crested the top of the dune, it was difficult to imagine that such an extraordinary place existed here. I was pleased to find the view didn't disappoint. Behind me stretched a forest canopy, rolling wooded hills, farmland and the iridescent waters of sprawling Glen Lake.

The following day, ignoring a gray sky, I set out to find my own private stretch of sand. I had arrived at an awkward time, in early June, when the weather can require a tank top one day and a down jacket the next. The actor Tim Allen, who has long summered in this part of northern Michigan, famously compared its climate to ""ripe pears -- really good for a short period of time."" Like me, he's among those who think that, on a sunny summer day, the area looks more like the Mediterranean than modest Michigan. ""If you get there between the Fourth of July and late August, in a stretch where it's 90 degrees, and you're standing on a white sand beach -- you'd be hard-pressed to tell me where you were, if you didn't know,"" the actor told Forbes magazine.

From there, I drove to nearby Esch Beach, following a gravel road through a pristine woodland, windows open. I could almost hear the ghosts of Aral, a logging boom town here in the late 1800s that all but disappeared once the timber was gone, around 1930. On impulse, I stopped and cut the motor; only the symphony of birdsong filled my ears. Drinking in the fresh air, I felt intoxicated. By the time I got to the nearly deserted beach, I was in full Zen mode. On this day, Lake Michigan was painted in a moody palette of grays and silvers, with a straight dark line at the overcast horizon. With no wind, the water was as smooth as glass and crystal-clear, its sandy bottom peppered with stones rounded by endless waves. I crouched by the water's edge and listened to the quiet, which was broken only by the gentle lapping of water on sand, as soothing as any sound machine. Less gentle was the frigid water, which wouldn't warm to swimsuit-worthy temperatures until July. I waded in to my knees, feeling my calves turn numb as a pro athlete's in an ice bath. A more appealing way to enjoy the lake appeared when three standup paddle boarders glided by, silent as swans. Surfers, too, can be seen catching waves year round, and you can rent a board or take a lesson through the friendly Sleeping Bear Surf & Kayak shop in Empire. I ambled down the beach to where a couple and two young children scavenged for Petoskey stones (Michigan's state stone) -- fossils beautifully laced with a honeycomb pattern, relics from when warm seas and coral reefs covered this region 350 million years ago. The father shook his head, while his impatient wife -- a Nebraska native -- had given up, deeming the treasure ""an urban legend,"" Lake Michigan's version of the Loch Ness monster. (Local stores hawking the stones, polished to a high sheen and often made into jewelry, would disagree.)

As a lakeshore overseen at the federal level, with the same protections as a national park, Sleeping Bear Dunes' beaches are blissfully free of snack bars, jungle gyms, life guard chairs and other trappings of civilization. They're in their natural state, these long expanses of sand. And amid the 35 miles of coastline, it's easy enough to find a deserted strand where you're free to do as you please -- up to a point: A sign along Esch Beach warns sun worshipers to KEEP YOUR SWIMSUIT ON. (A portion of the beach was once popular among nudists.) Curious about Sleeping Bear Dunes' history, I learned that some 14,000 years ago, retreating glaciers carved out Lake Michigan and left behind ridges and glacial moraines (headlands of rock and dirt). Westerly winds blowing across the lake piled sand atop the moraines, creating the spectacularly steep and tall dunes -- known as perched dunes -- that define the park. Following the retreat of the glaciers, Anishinabek Indians were active here when Europeans arrived in the mid-1600s, and some of the 100 miles of hiking trails trace well-worn paths the Indians followed across the dunes to reach their fishing camps. The park also maintains villages that thrived in the late 19th century: Port Oneida, a lumbering and farming community, and Glen Haven, a port town along an expansive beach where steamers stopped seeking food, lodging and wood for fuel. You can step back a century or so by meandering through their preserved buildings, including a fruit cannery (now a boat museum), general store and blacksmith shop.

There's another way to enjoy the coastline and the lake: from up high. The easy, 1.5-mile Empire Bluff Trail led me through a beech-maple forest to a lofty bluff above Lake Michigan, where I gaped at one of the prettiest views in all of the park, north along the lake's dune-draped shoreline. A more challenging hike took me huffing and puffing to the top of a steep headland known as Pyramid Point (a popular launching point for hang gliders and paragliders). But standing there, nearly straight above the lake, the only airborne things I saw were herring gulls coasting below me on the breeze. Happily, there's a way to see dramatic vistas without a hike that feels like a cardiac stress test: Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive, a seven-mile blacktop road that leads cars and cyclists through the wooded hills and towering dunes. (It's an especially lovely route when the leaves turn in fall.)

Numbered stops show off spectacular views, and the highlight is Stop 9, which boasts a wooden platform perched precariously atop a fiercely angled dune, some 450 feet above the water. It's surely the most Instagrammed spot in the park -- and perhaps the best place in the entire Midwest to watch the sunset, slowly melting into Lake Michigan. It's certainly not true that if you've seen one sunset you've seen them all, but I confess I spent as much time on the viewing structure looking down -- at folks racing to the bottom of the dune, then plodding back up. Those at the water's edge looked like mere specks from my perspective -- and had clearly ignored the sign that warned: ""Running down may sound fun. Trust us: Climbing up 450 feet of hot sand and gravel definitely is not."" Some learn the hard way: Last year, park rangers rescued 17 souls too tired, sick or scared to make their way back to the top. Climbing a dune is like walking up a down escalator, as many sand-savvy folks have noted, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Annie Dillard. But Mr. Ulrich, the park's deputy superintendent, appreciates the impulse. ""Anyone who visits Sleeping Bear Dunes,"" he concedes, ""should go home with a little sand in their shoes."" Back home from my trip a few days later, I readied my hiking socks for the wash and unleashed a small avalanche onto the floor.
