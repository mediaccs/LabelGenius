Health,Unicef Report Finds Female Genital Cutting to Be Common in Indonesia,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/health/indonesia-female-genital-cutting-circumcision-unicef.html,"Female genital cutting has always been seen as an ancient ritual practiced in Africa and to a lesser extent in the Middle East, but a new global assessment documents for the first time that it is widespread in one of the most populous countries in Asia: Indonesia, where almost half the women are estimated to have undergone it. There has long been anecdotal evidence of the practice there, but the United Nations Children's Fund estimated Thursday that 60 million women and girls there have been cut based on national survey data collected by the Indonesian government. The addition of Indonesia is largely responsible for raising the global tally of women and girls who have undergone the practice to 200 million from 130 million, and the number of countries where it is concentrated to 30 from 29. ""We knew the practice existed but we didn't have a sense of the scope,"" said Claudia Cappa, a statistics specialist for Unicef, which released the report. She said the new data from Indonesia showed that cutting was not just ""an African problem."" Experts in Indonesia said the practice there had largely involved a less drastic version of cutting, usually a surface scratch or nick, as compared with more severe disfiguring. The Indonesian government's survey asked parents if their young daughters had undergone circumcision. Ms. Cappa said it was possible that there were some more severe cases in Indonesia, but she said the official Indonesian government definition of female circumcision was ""an act of scratching the skin that covers the front of clitoris without injuring the clitoris.""

Some countries have shown rapid and significant declines. In Egypt, where 97 percent of 15- to 19-year-olds were circumcised 30 years ago, the rate is now 70 percent. Burkina Faso has dropped from 89 percent to 58 percent, and Liberia from 72 percent to 31 percent. Still, even as the United Nations advocates an end to cutting -- and Unicef surveys report that men, women, boys and girls in many of the countries agree it should be eliminated -- the practice persists. The Unicef report says that ""current progress is insufficient to keep up with increasing population growth"" and if trends continue the number of girls and women being cut ""will rise significantly over the next 15 years."" The data from Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation, provides a snapshot of the prevalence of genital cutting in a country where secular and religious attitudes toward the practice are increasingly in conflict. Indonesian authorities tried to ban cutting 10 years ago, but religious authorities who consider it important for girls to undergo the ritual before marriage objected. In response, the government softened its stance, issuing regulations that directed cutting should be done only by medical professionals in a noninvasive way that does not injure girls and women.

The Indonesian survey reported that 49 percent of girls age 11 and younger had undergone female circumcision, mostly as infants, and more than half of the procedures were performed by midwives or other health professionals. The practice is ""regarded as part of our culture, or a confirmation that they will be officially 'Islamized,' "" Jurnalis Uddin, the chairman of the Center for Population and Gender Studies at Yarsi University in Jakarta, said in an email, adding that the practice ""in Indonesia is mostly symbolic (no cutting at all)."" For Unicef and others who seek to eliminate the practice in all its forms, the fact that medical providers are performing the procedures is unwelcome because it can confer legitimacy on the practice. ""We are very concerned with medicalization,"" said Francesca Moneti, a child protection specialist with Unicef. ""Medical personnel are looked up to and are seen as knowing what's good for your girl."" The Indonesian survey, conducted in 2013 as part of large general health questionnaire administered to 300,000 households, was the first time the government collected national data on the practice. Although the data applied only to girls age 11 and younger, Unicef officials extrapolated it to the entire female population given the practice's deep roots there, Ms. Cappa said. Because Indonesia has such a large population, Unicef estimated that about 60 million women and girls in Indonesia have been cut. The survey found that the practice was reported in most provinces, but was more prevalent among urban and wealthier families.

But there are strong supporters like Lia Sarifah, 47, whose experience involved more than just a scratch and occurred when she was 7 because her parents wanted her to be old enough to remember it. She recalls shaking with fear as she lay down on a bed at her parents' house on the island of Sulawesi, and said a traditional healer pushed up the hem of her new dress, holding a small traditional knife in his gloved hands. A few minutes later he stood up with a small sliver of her clitoris. But Ms. Lia said she recalled that day not with anger or shame, but with pride. ""Even today, I believe in circumcision and support it,"" she said, sitting on the floor of her Jakarta salon, where she also makes and sells ceremonial dresses for young girls' circumcisions. ""If we don't, then we can't be whole as women and we can't marry."" Conflicting views have influenced public policy toward cutting. In 2006, the Ministry of Health issued a document banning female circumcision by medical professionals. In response, in 2008, Indonesia's top Muslim clerical body issued a nonbinding fatwa or edict saying female circumcision should be performed if requested, as long as the method was not physically or psychologically dangerous. In 2010, the Ministry of Health, at the urging of the clerical body, issued a regulation saying female circumcision should be performed only by licensed doctors, midwives or nurses using safety and cleanliness procedures detailed by the ministry. But anti-cutting activists objected to the regulation, and in 2014 it was repealed. Unicef officials assert in their report that the repeal does not go far enough because it does not explicitly prohibit cutting or set penalties for those who perform the procedure. In Jakarta, Fitri Yanti, a pregnant 30-year-old mother of two, said she did not understand what all the fuss was about. She said she was not mutilated during her circumcision, didn't bleed at all and felt nearly no pain during or after the procedure. ""Mutilation is horrible, but it's not true that it happens here"" in Indonesia, Ms. Fitri said. ""They cannot stop us. It's our tradition.""","A study by the agency found that the practice, long known as a ritual in Africa and parts of the Middle East, included almost half the women of Indonesia.",8960ad6f-34d6-5c1f-8ca2-b27c7497df84,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/05/science/05cutting1/05cutting1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=3dfc1bbf00aae59be7a2d6cc9e055882b315589c67e660a739918e84c7757dd4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Fitri Yanti, 30, in Jakarta, Indonesia, this week.

Movies,The New York Film Festival Names Its New Director,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/movies/new-york-film-festival-eugene-hernandez-director.html,"After the filmmaker Kent Jones stepped down from his role as the director of the New York Film Festival last fall, Film at Lincoln Center, which organizes the event, did not have to look far for his successor.

The organization announced Wednesday that Eugene Hernandez, its deputy executive director, has been appointed director of the festival.

Hernandez currently oversees the organization's artist, industry and education initiatives. He has also been the co-publisher of Film Comment magazine, along with Lesli Klainberg, the executive director of Film at Lincoln Center. With his new role, he will become the sole publisher of the magazine and will also serve on the festival's selection committee.

Hernandez hopes to attract even more global artists and audiences to the festival, he said in a phone interview. ""We're at such a great moment for cinema internationally,"" he said. It is ""humbling and exciting to be in this role at this very specific moment.""","Eugene Hernandez, the deputy executive director of Film at Lincoln Center, will take the reins from Kent Jones, who departed last fall.",b8b1d1b2-2fa3-5480-b418-5e3344910479,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/14/arts/00nyfilm-item1/00nyfilm-item1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=00a0e234f58fee7762e603222fec75538df7779939d42f2f5ad419887356b26d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Eugene Hernandez at a screening of the 2019 edition of the festival.,b8b1d1b2-2fa3-5480-b418-5e3344910479,N24News/imgs/b8b1d1b2-2fa3-5480-b418-5e3344910479.jpg,5
Sports,This College Football Team Had No Coronavirus Cases at First. Then It Shut Down.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/sports/ncaafootball/college-football-coronavirus-cases.html,"This College Football Team Had No Coronavirus Cases at First. Then It Shut Down.

When Kansas State opened the doors to its athletic facilities, welcoming its football players back to campus starting the first weekend in June, administrators breathed a sigh of relief once the first batch of coronavirus tests came back. The first wave of athletes spent a week in quarantine before voluntary workouts, as all players were required to do, and the scorecard was pristine: 90 tests, zero positives. Another six players straggled in a day or two later and were swabbed. Again, no positives. Then, by June 12, the final group of 24 arrivals -- largely freshmen -- was tested. But just a week later, Kansas State shut down its workouts until at least mid-July after two positive cases in that final group morphed into four and then eight before leaping to 14, as nearly half the team needed to be checked again. With its announcement on Saturday, Kansas State became the first school from a Power 5 conference to shut down football activities. Two other Football Bowl Subdivision schools did the same after outbreaks among their athletes, with Houston making the decision on June 12 and Boise State on Monday.

The swift escalation at Kansas State, from clean slate to clampdown, shows how perilous it can be for universities -- even with sanitized facilities, extensive protocols and without blocking and tackling in football practices -- to bring athletes back to campuses as more than half the country is experiencing spikes in coronavirus cases. Among the states with the most severe outbreaks in the United States is football-mad Texas, which has seen such a sharp rise in infections -- more than 5,000 new cases were reported on Tuesday -- that Gov. Greg Abbott, who had been bullish on an early reopening last month, urged residents to stay indoors. As university presidents, knowing the many millions of dollars that football generates, planned to open their campuses later this summer, there were other examples in the last week to give them pause. At Clemson, 28 athletes -- including 23 football players -- tested positive for the coronavirus. At Texas, 13 players tested positive and another 10 were self-isolating. And at Louisiana State, the reigning national champion, at least 30 players were in quarantine, according to Sports Illustrated. ""I think everyone realizes the plan is written in pencil,"" said Heather Lyke, the athletic director at Pittsburgh and a member of the N.C.A.A. Division I Council, which last week approved guidelines for how teams can practice leading into the season. She added: ""It's frankly hard to predict where things are going to go. The point where the council approved the calendar, things were in a reasonable state.""

If the future is murky, so, too, is the breadth of recent cases. There have been confirmed positive tests at 23 of the 130 F.B.S. schools, but some public schools -- including Ohio State, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina -- have refused to release testing data of their athletes, claiming that federal laws prohibiting the release of students' personal information allow them to not release aggregated data. And given the cost of testing -- close to $100 each at Kansas State, which will have about 120 players plus coaches and staff to test -- schools with tighter budgets will surely consider fewer tests. At U.C.L.A., 30 players -- including the team's starting quarterback -- demanded in a letter that a third-party health official be present when they participate in football-related activities because they did not trust school officials to act in their best interest with the virus. ""It shows this blatant disregard for what's going on in the nation and around the world with this pandemic,"" said Billy Hawkins, a University of Houston professor who has written on the black athletic experience. He lauded the U.C.L.A. players and said workouts around the country should not take place until there is a vaccine or schools can assure players, who are not paid salaries, that they will not get sick. ""If they continue in this voluntary phase, if they continue along this path, obviously more cases are going to emerge in this population,"" Hawkins added. ""What scares me the most is when I hear people say, 'Oh, they're young. It's easier to recover.' I don't know if that's a guarantee.""

The decision by Kansas State to halt workouts was straightforward. Gene Taylor, Kansas State's athletic director, said it was becoming too difficult to regulate close contact among the players, and that there was concern that a recent surge in cases could overwhelm the local health care system in Manhattan, Kan., a college town two hours west of Kansas City with about 55,000 residents and a main hospital with only about 12 intensive care beds available. ""We may not have the capacity if this thing takes off and there were hospitalizations,"" Taylor said. ""We want to monitor the ones in quarantine, make sure we don't have more positives. We'll take a pause, then retest again when we get back.""

Taylor said what contributed to the outbreak was the three-day gap between the testing on June 12, a Friday, and getting the results on June 15, a Monday. The initial two players who tested positive had spent the weekend with groups of teammates -- one at an apartment playing video games with anywhere from eight to 15 players, and one who went with a group to nearby Tuttle Creek Lake, a popular recreation spot. When players reported on June 15, the day workouts began, there were two more players who had fevers, a symptom of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. As those who were in close contact with infected players were tested again, more positives cropped up -- which led to more testing. In all, close to 55 players were retested, Taylor said. ""It rolled through the week like that and by Friday we got together and said, 'We've got to make a decision,'"" Taylor said. The players congregating without masks or social distancing made innocent mistakes, Taylor said. But in a Zoom meeting last week with Coach Chris Klieman, the players and their parents, Taylor told players they could lose their scholarships if they did not follow protocols -- just the way they would if they regularly broke team rules.

In an interview, Taylor said that would not happen and, he added, Klieman reiterated as much to the players and a few anxious parents the next day. But Taylor said he wanted to get the players' attention. ""I, at the end of the conversation, was just asking them please, please, please, please be careful,"" Taylor said. ""You have to understand how serious this can be and how it can get through the entire team. I was almost begging them. Sometimes players need to hear a little stronger language than others. There were just a few that needed to have a wake-up call. I think that wake-up call is very real now.""

In Riley County, where the school is, half of the diagnosed coronavirus cases (78 of 156 as of Wednesday) were among the college-age population, ages 18 to 24. Public health officials rely on a grading metric that tracks movement within the county, comparing it to pre-pandemic levels. Earlier during the outbreak, Riley County received an A for social distancing. Now it rates as an F. ""At that point, we were staying home more, only going out for essentials, so our movement was low,"" Julie Gibbs, the Riley County health director, said of the change in an email. ""With businesses opening up, we expected to see more movement, but I did not expect to see our grade drop quite that much. We need to get back to where we were before."" The bump in infections among college-age adults, she added, is because too many are going to clubs and bars, and not wearing masks or keeping the prescribed six feet away from others. The outbreak at L.S.U. came in large part from players going to a popular bar when they arrived back in Baton Rouge, La., according to Sports Illustrated. Some schools have tried to insulate themselves from liability by requiring athletes returning to campuses for workouts to sign waivers acknowledging the risk of being infected -- or in the case of at least one school, Southern Methodist, releasing it from any liability. (Kansas State did not have a waiver, but provided its protocols to players and their parents and asked for feedback.) The waivers have caught the attention of lawmakers. On Wednesday, Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Cory Booker of New Jersey urged Mark Emmert, the president of the N.C.A.A., to prohibit such waivers, calling them ""legally dubious"" and ""morally repugnant."" Zachary Binney, an epidemiologist at Emory University, said if players were getting sick after returning to school -- for the sole purpose of training for football, not going to class -- it was almost immaterial whether they became infected while lifting weights or at a local watering hole. ""They got exposed because you -- the athletic department -- brought them back to campus,"" Binney said. ""They were only at the bar because you told them to come back. Getting sick is a perfectly foreseeable consequence of calling students back to campus.""

Taylor, the Kansas State athletic director, said it was ""a fair question"" to ask why schools have their athletes back on campus now, preparing for a season whose shape and scope will surely be altered by the pandemic. But he said the summer workouts, which are deemed voluntary, help prevent some injuries once practice begins and allow players to make progress toward their degrees by picking up summer school credits. For now, Kansas State football players have been asked to shelter in place for two weeks before they are retested. The only ones who are required to stay are the 14 who have tested positive, Taylor said. Many of the infected were already living together in houses or apartments, so they can stay put. Several who live with players who did not test positive have moved into dorms by themselves. Taylor said that workers in protective gear are delivering two meals per day, along with groceries, to the infected players. The outbreak prompted Kansas State to also push back the date for opening workouts for its other fall teams, cross-country and women's volleyball, which had already returned to campus to quarantine for one week before they were scheduled to be tested on Wednesday. They will instead be tested on July 1 and begin practicing no earlier than July 5. Football players, once they test negative between July 6 and 9, could resume workouts as early as July 13. At the moment, that seems far away. The season-opening game, scheduled for Sept. 5 against visiting Buffalo, is a distant speck on the horizon in the Little Apple. There, and on many other campuses, excitement for the looming season has been diminished by uncertainty -- and so many questions.",A spike in positive coronavirus tests is prompting universities across college sports to acknowledge how precarious their plans are for a season.,44e8c4af-ca9e-5785-9ac5-80e3b0808911,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/26/sports/25virus-collegefootball-1/25virus-collegefootball-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=ed9d7339834a4d05ebb90fb75802c92042585e1a053eecffd9e266be95f1c48d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Kansas State had to shut down workouts until mid-July after 14 players tested positive for the coronavirus.,44e8c4af-ca9e-5785-9ac5-80e3b0808911,N24News/imgs/44e8c4af-ca9e-5785-9ac5-80e3b0808911.jpg,9
Opinion,"A Crisis for Trump, and for America",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/opinion/letters/covid-trump-crisis.html,"We are all saddened at the news of President Trump's positive coronavirus test. But for the past eight months Mr. Trump has flagrantly disavowed the strong recommendations of the nation's leading medical experts regarding distancing and masks. Now all those in recent contact with him are concerned for their personal health, as well they should be.

We can only hope that Mr. Trump will now develop some empathy for those Americans who have lost family members, friends, jobs and businesses, all because of his dishonesty and his politicizing of what he knew early on was an approaching pandemic.

In discussing President Trump's positive coronavirus test, The Times states that ""the positive test could prove devastating to his political fortunes."" However, it is entirely possible that it could give him a boost right when he needs it.

If Mr. Trump and the first lady have relatively mild illnesses, he and his base could view that as evidence that he has been right all along, that this virus is no worse than the flu, and that a crisis was created by the media and the Democrats to make him look bad.","""May his illness be a wake-up call to our country that when it comes to our nation's health, science trumps politics,"" one reader says.",887b4e76-bc9d-5347-a13a-c8aea6a70070,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/02/world/02virus-briefing-trump-virus-1/02virus-briefing-trump-virus-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=83a32a18046d39c4059aebbd81de4ebecefba0df15a295e0bddcdee1b14b65cf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,President Trump initially dismissed the threat of the virus by likening it to the common flu.,887b4e76-bc9d-5347-a13a-c8aea6a70070,N24News/imgs/887b4e76-bc9d-5347-a13a-c8aea6a70070.jpg,11

I'm confused about where the line between our friendship and our work together is drawn.

How does it work between you, as dancer and choreographer?

WHELAN I trust Brian's instincts. I think Brian is looking at me for who I am. And I feel free to say stuff along the way.

BROOKS I come in with a conceptual idea, with music, movement material, research questions and phrases and sequences. But I'm definitely sensitive to who's in the studio. I pay attention to what comes back at me from the dancers. I teach a phrase and then Wendy bends it and pulls it.

BROOKS It's call and response. Like, how do you translate this? She draws attention to aspects of my own work that I'm blind to. Her sense of suspension of time through the gaze and gesture is fundamental to the work. I'm more of a manic choreographer by choice -- the idea of moving as fast as you can until something stops you has been elemental for me.

Do you use that opposition in the piece?

BROOKS We're trying to find an equilibrium between us as we go through the same set of tasks. To have us walk forward side by side down to center-stage, even that simple arrival is a way to get information about these two people.

What intrigues you about Brian's work?

WHELAN The intricacy of his folding and unfolding and winding and twisting. I love the arm work. I have these really long arms, and I have to say my arms are sometimes my favorite body part, so I like what he gives me to do with them. And I like the mental challenge of what he gives me to do.

Sports,"In Rare Interview, James Dolan Insists He Won't Sell Knicks",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/sports/james-dolan-knicks.html,"Despite the wishes of at least one fan, James L. Dolan is adamant that he will not sell the Knicks. ""For the record, I am not selling the team, and I am not quitting,"" Dolan, the team's owner, said on Tuesday during a rare radio interview. Even, he was asked, if he were offered $6 billion, much more than the team is valued? ""No, we are not selling the team,"" he said. Dolan was speaking on The Michael Kay Show on 98.7 ESPN New York three days after a Knicks fan confronted him after a loss at Madison Square Garden and yelled for him to sell the team. Dolan told the fan he was being rude, and implied that he would be banned from the Garden. Dolan said on Tuesday that if he could have done things over again he would not have ""taken the bait"" and instead would have walked past the fan without engaging.

Dolan confirmed that the fan, who has yet to be publicly identified, was indeed banned from the Garden. ""If you have someone that comes in and plans on making a scene and being confrontational and ruining the event for other people, including the owner, you can't come back,"" he said. ""I'm sorry."" In the interview, Dolan was challenged by the hosts on various issues, including his treatment of the New York Daily News. While the Daily News is granted the access to Knicks games and practices required by the N.B.A.'s media guidelines, the paper's reporters have not been included at certain Knicks news conferences this season. ""There are certain journalists that, you know, actually wish ill will toward the team,"" Dolan said. ""They have never written a positive story about the team. Like the Porzingis trade, those guys were like, it's the most horrible thing, another horrible thing has happened."" Dolan said he was not concerned about appearing thin-skinned for banning the outlet. ""I don't make my decisions by P.R.,"" he said. ""I make my decisions based on what I think is right or wrong."" When one of the hosts, in reference to the team excluding the Daily News, called the Knicks a public trust, Dolan vehemently disagreed.

""The Knicks are not owned by the public,"" he said. ""They are owned by the shareholders of the company, of which I am the majority shareholder, so no."" Kyle Wagner, the Daily News' editor in charge of sports, defended the news outlet's coverage in a statement emailed to The New York Times. ""M.S.G.'s grudge against the Daily News predates the journalists writing about the Knicks in our pages today,"" the statement said. ""If the tone of coverage tends to be negative, it's because the team is 41 games under .500 and has the worst winning percentage in the N.B.A. over the last 20 seasons."" The Knicks have the worst record in the N.B.A., and will miss the playoffs for a sixth consecutive season. But there is room for optimism based on the team having one of the top picks in this year's draft and the fact that they will be far enough under the salary cap to sign two maximum-salary players this off-season. A number of top players -- including Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard, Kyrie Irving, Kemba Walker and Klay Thompson -- are expected to be free agents, and Dolan is confident the Knicks will be able to sign two of the top players despite the team's woes. ""Free agents want to go to a winner and get paid,"" said Dolan. ""We are definitely going to pay them, and we think that with them and the kids we have today, we can build a winning team."" Reading from a piece of paper in front of him, Dolan cited Mitchell Robinson, Kevin Knox, Allonzo Trier and Damyean Dotson as the young players who would complement any free agent signings. The idea that Dolan might sell the team gained steam last month after the sports personality Bill Simmons said on his podcast that Dolan was ""courting offers,"" citing people he talked to at the All-Star Game.

The Knicks refuted the report at the time, and during Tuesday's interview Dolan theorized that a rival general manager was giving Simmons bad information in order to destabilize the Knicks. ""There are teams that do not want us to get free agents, some in particular,"" said Dolan. ""He is very close friends with a G.M. of one team.

Worlds Within Worlds Mix It Up at the Winter Show

Top to bottom, ""Blue, Red and White Blossom"" (2019), hanji Korean rice paper with oil on canvas by Sung Hee Cho; a 19th-century buffalo beaded helmet mask from what is now Cameroon, at Tambaran.

Art fairs are for looking, looking and more looking. They offer the concentrated absorption of the visual, cultural and historical, compressed into one location. A manageable size helps, along with a high degree of quality and kaleidoscopic diversity. The 66th Winter Show, located in the Park Avenue Armory, has size on its side -- the large but not too large Wade Thompson Drill Hall -- along with a goodly amount of quality from 72 exhibitors. And the fair signaled its intent to diversify by changing its name from the Winter Antiques Show last year. The present incarnation needs to mix things up much more, especially where non-Western art is concerned. A pair of newcomers, the dealers Patrick & Ondine Mestdagh, are doing their bit with a display of art and artifacts from Australia, Indonesia, Africa, India and Japan that resembles a kind of global kunstkabinett. Dealers were also encouraged to combine older and contemporary material wherever possible. At Tambaran, for example, ritual objects including a buffalo beaded helmet mask from the Bamun people of present-day Cameroon are paired with recent confetti-like paintings involving hanji Korean rice paper by the artist Sung Hee Cho. Sticking to Japan, Erik Thomsen has done a stellar job, contrasting groups of lacquer tea caddies or baskets by pre-war bamboo masters with large screens and scrolls, often from other periods.

Or perhaps a dense display of 50 terrestrial and celestial globes from the 16th to the 20th centuries at Daniel Crouch Rare Books. They include a magnificent pair by the exemplar of Dutch Golden Age cartography, Willem Blaeu, whose works figure in some of Vermeer's paintings. Even more enthralling are two manuscript globes by Emmy Ingeborg Brun (1872-1929), a Danish writer, socialist and astronomer, that incorporated the latest discoveries about Mars -- briefly considered possible for socialist resettlement -- into fanciful spheres that Joseph Cornell might have made.

If painted furniture is one of your failings, visit Robert Young to see an 1814 English wedding cabinet painted bright yellow with red flowers and vases. Outstanding at Thistlethwaite Americana is a small bureau, brushed, sponged and combed to resemble wood grain, only more voluptuous. David A. Schorsch-Eileen M. Smiles, whose array of folk art and folk furniture is among the show's best, has a lift-top chest with black on dark green that exaggerates grain painting to the point of landscape. Equally strong: a pair of meticulous watercolor portraits by Dr. Samuel Addison Shute. Man and wife are seen with brushy sky-blue backgrounds that are themselves distinctly contemporary.

The centerpiece in Lillian Nassau's perennial display of all things Louis Comfort Tiffany is a virtually unknown center table with aprons of pastel-colored stained glass. On it sits a Tiffany Studios weight balance table lamp made with white turtle back glass and iridescent favrile glass tiles. ""Swimming Carp,"" a gorgeous four-panel screen, offers a swirl of fish and water painted in translucent shades of green and metallic gold by Candace Wheeler, who formed Associated Artists with Tiffany and collaborated with him (along with Stanford White and Samuel Colman) on the Armory's unrivaled Veterans Room.

The seemingly coherent arrangement at Cove Landing is actually a diverse potpourri of English and Continental items, including 19th-century walnut side chairs attributed to the Italian architect and set designer Agostino Fantastici (1782-1845), whose delightfully spare backs might be from the 20th century (T.H. Robsjohn Gibbings comes to mind). But the star here is a French 19th-century circular table whose oyster-cut veneer top is a Big Bang explosion of radiating ovals from twigs and branches of elm and yew burl.

Elle Shushan has devoted most of her space to the bright, subtly comedic historical paintings of Andrew LaMar Hopkins, a 42-year-old artist, which depict the important figures and lavish interiors of 18th- and 19th-century Creole life in New Orleans, where Mr. Hopkins was born. The vividness of each painting speaks for itself, but there are also texts by the artist identifying the subjects and detailing their rooms' furnishings.

When you reach the ""just one more"" level of saturation, booths that feature a single work of irrefutable power let you decompress toward departure. Dominant at the excellent Robert Simon Fine Art is a rare example of female portraiture from the Peruvian Cuzco School, around 1690-1710. The high status of a grande (if unknown) dame is confirmed by her opulent array of black velvet, lace and pearls. Michael Goedhuis has a 12th- to 14th-century Chinese carved stone capital of a coiled dragon resting on a wood column that seems certain to have its own pedigree. At Ronald Phillips Ltd. you may only have eyes for the spectacular Japanned bureau cabinet from 1745, by the great British cabinetmaker Giles Grendey (1693-1780), that may have been part of a large group made for a German client -- judging by the Prussian-looking eagle on top.

Economy,"U.S. Job Growth Picks Up the Pace, but Wages Lag Behind",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/07/business/economy/jobs-report-june-unemployment.html,"U.S. Job Growth Picks Up the Pace, but Wages Lag Behind

Automobile sales may be slowing, e-commerce is putting the squeeze on bricks-and-mortar stores, and overall economic growth is limp. But the labor market has nevertheless managed to charge ahead. Employers added an impressive 222,000 jobs in June, the government reported on Friday. Although the jobless rate ticked up slightly to 4.4 percent, it was because some people who had dropped out of the labor force were lured back. But the hunger for workers and mounting complaints of labor shortages have raised a vexing question: Why isn't the heightened demand for workers driving up pay? The Federal Reserve pointed to that conundrum in the updated report on the American economy it sent to Congress on Friday. ""Despite the broad-based strength in measures of employment,"" it said, ""wage growth has been only modest, possibly held down by the weak pace of productivity growth in recent years.""

The Fed's report reflected its overall confidence in the country's economic direction, which has led it to begin raising interest rates for businesses and consumers after years of holding them near zero to encourage investment and risk-taking. After increasing its benchmark rate last month, the Fed is expected to do so at least once more before the year's end. One of its aims is to head off any inflation that might result from a tight job market that prompts employers to offer higher pay to get the workers they need. Yet prices have been rising at a slow pace, and sluggish wage growth suggests that the fear may be premature. ""The payroll number is well above expectations,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics. ""It's pretty clear that the trend in employment growth is strong enough to keep the unemployment rate trending down."" Revisions to earlier estimates brought the monthly average gain since April to 194,000. But year-over-year wage growth plodded along at 2.5 percent. ""The wage numbers are certainly weaker than expected,"" Mr. O'Sullivan said, ""so it keeps alive the whole debate about the relationship between slack and inflation, and how far the Federal Reserve should allow the unemployment rate to fall.""

""This is not a market we have typically seen,"" said Michael Stull, senior vice president at the staffing company Manpower North America. ""We have not before seen unemployment drop, low participation rates and wages not move. That tells you something's not right in the labor market."" Employers are very aware that the pool of workers is shrinking and they are rethinking traditional qualifications like length of experience, Mr. Stull said. ""Employers will take on hard-working, reliable workers even if they don't have an opening,"" he said. At the same time, he said that workers were ""pushing back a little bit about driving an hour for a $10-an-hour job at a distribution center on the outer rim of the city.""
* Stocks rise after President Biden says Jerome Powell will stay atop the Fed.
* Retail earnings and Black Friday: the week in business. ""You need a car for that,"" Mr. Stull said, ""and you can't have a car on $10 an hour."" That's a familiar problem to Tom Thompson, owner of Star Cleaning Systems in Columbus, Ohio. He is looking to add two or three part-time workers to his 20-member staff. ""Very few people show up for interviews, and if they do, they don't show up for the job,"" Mr. Thompson said. ""I'm spending 80 to 90 percent of my time recruiting. I triple-book appointments for interviews, and I'm lucky if I get one person to show up.""

He is offering $9.25 an hour to start, with bonuses and increases for workers who stick around. Running a new company, he said, he cannot afford to pay significantly more. Nearby distribution centers for big companies like Amazon are sucking up most of the available labor, Mr. Thompson said. ""I sometimes wish there was actually a higher unemployment rate,"" he said. Like Star Cleaning, Rooforia Home Exteriors in Omaha often finds customers through Thumbtack, an online marketplace for hiring people to complete tasks. These days it is the workers who are tougher to find. ""We did everything we could to recruit people and had not one application,"" said Rooforia's owner, Sarah M. Smith. She is depending on guest-worker visas to fill openings for the season, which runs from the spring through November. ""It's hard work in Nebraska,"" Ms. Smith said. ""We have hot summers, and you're on a black asphalt roof.""

""We had one person we recruited,"" she said. ""He didn't even show up the next day."" Patrick Bass, chief executive of Thyssenkrupp North America, part of a German multinational conglomerate, said his company was increasingly relying on methods common in Germany like apprenticeships, partnerships with colleges, and internships. ""We're willing to invest in the people and bring them in and train them,"" Mr. Bass said. ""But for the basic-skill job, we're seeing a higher turnover rate than normal. People are job shopping a bit, because they can. They're trying different things to see what they like."" While the government's statistics offer a bird's-eye perspective, hiring is essentially local. ""Even in an era of low national unemployment, with recent jobs reports showing the national unemployment rate ticking down close to 4 percent, jobs are not always available and not everyone who wants work can find it,"" Martha Ross, a fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, noted in her blog. ""There is no one-size-fits-all approach to help people prepare for and find jobs."" Professional services showed a healthy gain in jobs last month, possibly reflecting the hiring of new college graduates. Other sectors that showed substantial gains included health care, social assistance and food services. Reviews of the economy tend to reflect political affiliations, with Republicans more optimistic since the election than Democrats. Ideology aside, however, uncertainty about federal policy may be weighing on the economy. Businesses reported a burst of optimism after President Trump's election, in part because of expectations that the new administration would enact fiscal measures like tax cuts. But that buoyant outlook is fading. ""This cautious approach to investment may in part reflect uncertainty about the policy environment,"" Stanley Fischer, the Fed's vice chairman, told an audience in Vineyard Haven, Mass., on Thursday. ""Providing more clarity on the future direction of government policy is highly desirable."" Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement,""This new report shows positive gains: Job creation came in higher than expected and the labor force grew,"" but he added, ""We have a lot more work to do.""","Employers added 222,000 workers in June, a healthy showing, but a tightening labor market has not followed historical patterns in driving up pay.",bb7389e8-e0a6-5ad2-8cf4-25536c668f51,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/08/business/08JOBS/08JOBS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=3280751831189b8c806b06b22439790a921921294a582b7081998b81e39c7aca&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A UPS worker making deliveries in Lower Manhattan.

Media,"Selfies on a Stick, and the Social-Content Challenge for the Media",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/05/business/media/selfies-on-a-stick-and-the-social-content-challenge-for-the-media.html,"Sometimes you don't need an analyst's report to get a look at the future of the media industry and the challenges it will bring. On New Year's Eve, I was one of the poor souls working in Times Square. By about 1 p.m., it was time to evacuate, and when I stepped into the cold that would assault the huddled, partying masses that night, a couple was getting ready to pose for a photo with the logo on The New York Times Building in the background. I love that I work at a place that people deem worthy of memorializing, and I often offer to help. My assistance was not required. As I watched, the young couple mounted their phone on a collapsible pole, then extended it outward, the camera now able to capture the moment in wide-screen glory. I'd seen the same phenomenon when I was touring the Colosseum in Rome last month. So many people were fighting for space to take selfies with their long sticks -- what some have called the ""Narcissistick"" -- that it looked like a reprise of the gladiatorial battles the place once hosted.

The urge to stare at oneself predates mirrors -- you could imagine a Neanderthal fussing with his hair, his image reflected in a pool of water -- but it has some pretty modern dimensions. In the forest of billboards in Times Square, the one with a camera that captures the people looking at the billboard always draws a big crowd. Selfies are hardly new, but the incremental improvement in technology of putting a phone on a stick -- a curiously analog fix that Time magazine listed as one of the best inventions of 2014 along with something called the ""high-beta fusion reactor"" -- suggests that the seance with the self is only going to grow. (Selfie sticks are often used to shoot from above, which any self-respecting selfie auteur will tell you is the most flattering angle.) There are now vast, automated networks to harvest all that narcissism, along with lots of personal data, creating extensive troves of user-generated content. The tendency to listen to the holy music of the self is reflected in the abundance of messaging and self-publishing services -- Vine, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Instagram, Apple's new voice messaging and the rest -- all of which pose a profound challenge for media companies. Most media outfits are in the business of one-to-many, creating single pieces of text, images or audio meant to be shared by the masses. But most sharing does not involve traditional media companies. Consumers are increasingly glued to their Facebook feeds as a source of information about not just their friends but the broader world as well. And with the explosive growth of Snapchat, the fastest-growing social app of the last year, much of the sharing that takes place involves one-to-one images that come and go in 10 seconds or less. Getting a media message -- a television show, a magazine, a website, not to mention the ads that pay for most of it -- into the intimate space between consumers and a torrent of information about themselves is only going to be more difficult. I've been around since before there was a consumer Internet, but my frame of reference is as neither a Luddite nor a curmudgeon. I didn't end up with over half a million followers on social media -- Twitter and Facebook combined -- by posting only about broadband regulations and cable deals. (Not all self-flattering portraits are rendered in photos. You see what I did there, right?) The enhanced ability to communicate and share in the current age has many tangible benefits.

My wife travels a great deal, sometimes to perilous regions, and WhatsApp's global reach gives us a stable way of staying in touch. Over the holidays, our family shared endless photos, emoticons and inside jokes in group messages that were very much a part of Christmas. Not that long ago, we might have spent the time gathered around watching ""Elf,"" but this year, we were brought together by the here and now, the familiar, the intimate and personal. We didn't need a traditional media company to help us create a shared experience.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Many younger consumers have become mini-media companies themselves, madly distributing their own content on Vine, Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat. It's tough to get their attention on media created for the masses when they are so busy producing their own. And while the addiction to self is not restricted to millennials -- boomers bow to no one in terms of narcissism -- there are now easy-to-use platforms that amplify that self-reflecting impulse. While legacy media companies still make products meant to be studied and savored over varying lengths of time -- the movie ""Boyhood,"" The Atlantic magazine, the novel ""The Goldfinch"" -- much of the content that individuals produce is ephemeral. Whatever bit of content is in front of someone -- text messages, Facebook posts, tweets -- is quickly replaced by more and different. For Snapchat, the fact that photos and videos disappear almost immediately is not a flaw, it's a feature. Users can send content into the world with little fear of creating a trail of digital breadcrumbs that advertisers, parents or potential employers could follow. Warhol's 15 minutes of fame has been replaced by less than 15 seconds on Snapchat. Facebook, which is a weave of news encompassing both the self and the world, has become, for many, a de facto operating system on the web. And many of the people who aren't busy on Facebook are up for grabs on the web but locked up on various messaging apps. What used to be called the audience is disappearing into apps, messaging and user-generated content. Media companies in search of significant traffic have to find a way into that stream. ""The majority of time that people are spending online is on Facebook,"" said Anthony De Rosa, editor in chief of Circa, a mobile news start-up. ""You have to find a way to break through or tap into all that narcissism. We are way too into ourselves."" Facebook may be dominant, but Snapchat is growing much faster, over 55 percent in the last six months, whose younger-skewing audience tells you where things might be headed. Selfies are the dominant metier of Snapchat, an art form so addictive that New York State passed a law, to take effect in February, that outlaws self-portraits with tigers and lions, one trend that would seem, um, ill-advised. Later on New Year's Eve, along with more than 10 million others, I settled in with friends to watch the ball drop as Ryan Seacrest hosted the countdown on ABC. Aside from Taylor Swift, the big star of the evening was Hearst Magazines, which distributed pink top hats and balloons branded with the logos of Cosmopolitan magazine and CoverGirl cosmetics. Clearly, live broadcast television events still draw a crowd, and Cosmopolitan's name was everywhere you looked, so in that sense, the old order had been restored.","The tendency to listen to the holy music of the self is reflected not only in the selfie stick, but also in apps like Snapchat and Instagram, which pose a profound challenge for media companies.",e4968018-1c1d-518d-8ad6-565256ad1f21,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/05/business/05jpcarr/05jpcarr-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=b30c56f5cd3912d6ca305555cf9e96b015cde8d9f319ab77f9f5bf49cf139ed4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A family commemorates New Year's Eve in Times Square using a collapsible pole that improves camera angles for self-portraits.,e4968018-1c1d-518d-8ad6-565256ad1f21,N24News/imgs/e4968018-1c1d-518d-8ad6-565256ad1f21.jpg,16
Real Estate,Winning the Housing Lottery,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/realestate/winning-the-housing-lottery.html,"When Rebekah Miranda and her daughter Amber Valentin moved into a brand-new apartment last September, it was a first for both of them. Ms. Miranda, 45, had lived in the same three-bedroom in the Morrisania neighborhood of the Bronx since she was a year old, and she had raised her four daughters there. Ms. Valentin, 18, her youngest, had lived there her entire life. Certainly, it wasn't love for their old place that had kept them there so long. The apartment, located in Forest Houses, a New York City Housing Authority project, was in constant disrepair, and Ms. Miranda, a 911 dispatcher, often returned from work at odd hours to find strangers hanging out in the building. ""I'd come home and there would be people in the lobby that didn't even live there,"" said Ms. Miranda, who was also unhappy about the condition of the building. ""It was just continuous repairs being done year after year -- roof leaking, paint peeling. I got tired of it,"" she said. ""I was embarrassed to have people over with all the repairs needing to be done in the kitchen and bathroom.""

Her parents had left years earlier when they bought a condo nearby, and her siblings had moved to other neighborhoods and cities as well. But Ms. Miranda never felt she could risk going herself. In the projects, rent was tied to income, so if her hours were cut or she lost her job, she wouldn't lose her home. Her caution seemed prudent when FEGS, the social-service nonprofit where she'd been a program assistant for years, declared bankruptcy in 2015 and she lost her job. By then, two of her daughters had left home, but Amber and another daughter who was completing a master's degree in social work were still living with her.

""To risk making less and not being able to make rent scared me,"" Ms. Miranda said. ""I didn't want to take chances."" A few years ago, however, a friend who'd found an affordable apartment through a housing lottery urged her to do the same. ""I started applying for every lottery in the Bronx,"" said Ms. Miranda, who didn't want to work too far from the borough's dispatch center near Pelham Bay. She was contacted about several units, but was twice denied because the overtime she worked had pushed her above the income cap.

Finally, she got a call about a two-bedroom at St. Augustine Terrace, a new 12-story building on the site of an old Catholic Church on East 167th Street. This one she qualified for, and she and Ms. Valentin, who is now a student at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, moved in last fall, paying $1,066 a month. Occupation: Ms. Miranda is a 911 dispatcher. Ms. Valentin studies psychology at the Borough of Manhattan Community College.

St. Augustine Terrace: A third of its 112 affordable units are designated for adults with mental illness, who are served by the Beacon of Hope Division of Catholic Charities Community Services.

Ms. Valentin's sisters: They all live in the New York area, though only one remains in the Bronx. ""We all have a group text. We used to get together more when everyone lived closer,"" Ms. Miranda said. ""But they'll all come over for dinner.""

The electric bill: Ms. Miranda at first worried about the cost, because she had never been responsible for electricity. ""But because we get so much natural light, Con Ed doesn't need to be on much.""

Large windows in the apartments and common spaces are among the most distinctive features of the building, which was designed for Affiliates of Catholic Charities by Magnusson Architecture and Planning. The firm included floor-to-ceiling windows in the expansive elevator lobbies on every floor, taking advantage of the fact that in an affordable-housing development, views didn't have to be reserved for the most expensive apartments. ""The windows caught my eye automatically when I walked in,"" Ms. Miranda said. ""They're huge. You can sit on the windowsill and look out when it rains. It's gorgeous.""

The building sits atop a rocky hill and is surrounded by a landscaped garden. ""The view from the top is amazing,"" Ms. Miranda said. ""When you come out of the elevator, it's all windows. On the Fourth of July we went up to the top floor to watch the fireworks."" Ms. Valentin and Ms. Miranda say they are surprised by how quiet it is in their first-floor apartment. ""We thought being on the first floor, the noise would be crazy,"" Ms. Miranda said. ""It's super quiet. Even on the hottest days this year we didn't hear much."" Except for the hardwood floors, that is. Never having lived in a new building before, the women didn't realize that new wood floors settle. ""It would suddenly sound like someone was walking in the living room at night and scare us,"" Ms. Miranda said.",A mother and daughter move from the Bronx housing project where they've lived all their lives to a brand-new apartment nearby.,161f3301-961f-5e7b-a1f6-66b6a740afe1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/22/realestate/16renters1/16renters1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=61a5841c72c0513cc452d38ff27a90ec1e4e93c73b6bccbd5b3ae0e558b620de&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Rebekah Miranda and her daughter, Amber Valentin, moved into a two-bedroom apartment in a new building in Morrisania last fall.",161f3301-961f-5e7b-a1f6-66b6a740afe1,N24News/imgs/161f3301-961f-5e7b-a1f6-66b6a740afe1.jpg,7

Your Money,"When Interest Rates Rise, Stocks Don't Have to Fall",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/your-money/when-interest-rates-rise-stocks-neednt-fall.html,"LOW interest rates have helped to fuel the stock market rally, and a climb in rates is eventually expected to snuff it out. At least that's the theory. Here's the reality: In May, rates actually rose quite sharply, as 10-year Treasury yields jumped to 2.16 percent from 1.63 percent. Yet the Dow Jones industrial average still soared more than 400 points, to end the month at 15,115.57. The stock market's road did become choppy as rates rose. The Dow lost more than 200 points on Friday, for example, but the overall trend remained upward. It just goes to show that while there is a connection between interest rates and the stock market, it isn't a simple one. When rates rise, said Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, ""it is not the size of the move itself, but the absolute level of yields reached that matters to the stock market."" Even with the recent uptick, the 10-year yields are only about half of what they were five years ago, during the global recession. And a climb in rates from such a low level may be a tail wind -- not a headwind -- for stocks, Mr. Kleintop said.

For starters, he said, ""it reflects an improving outlook for economic growth and less risk of deflation."" Both are welcome developments to equity investors. Moreover, ""it results in losses for bonds,"" he said, which may prompt investors to sell those bonds and move money into stocks. Indeed, over the past month, the average bond fund that invests in long-term government debt has lost more than 6.5 percent of its value, according to Morningstar, the investment research firm. The typical blue-chip stock fund, meanwhile, has gained about 4 percent. But this is not to say that rising interest rates wouldn't hurt the stock market at all. For instance, if rates were to climb enough to threaten the rebound in housing, stocks might start to sing a different tune, market strategists say. But the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is still at a historically low 3.81 percent, even though that rate is up since the end of April. Similarly, climbing rates would threaten stocks if they signaled rising inflation, so that the Federal Reserve might have to curtail its efforts to stimulate the economy. But the most recent reading of the Consumer Price Index showed that prices were up only around 1.1 percent over the past 12 months. That's down from the 1.6 percent pace of inflation at the start of the year.

Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer at the Leuthold Group, has looked at stock valuations and bond yields going back to 1878. He has found that while there is a relationship between the two, big trouble for the stock market appears to kick in only when 10-year Treasuries are yielding 6 percent or higher. Theories abound as to why 6 percent seems the magic number. James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, argues that 6 percent is important because it reflects the overall economy's nominal long-term growth rate. ""I can see why you'd get a negative reaction if the cost of capital for the market was above the inherent, sustainable growth rate of the economy,"" he said. Mr. Ramsey offers a slightly different explanation. He said that for rising bond yields to hurt the stock market, they would have to be viewed by investors as real competition to stocks. Perhaps at 6 percent, he said, bond yields are high enough that ""they are truly thought of as potential replacements or substitutes for long-term stock returns."" TO be sure, some market watchers say what really matters isn't the current move in long-term market rates, but what happens with the short-term rate that the Fed controls. Recently, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, hinted that the central bank might soon begin to taper its purchases of Treasury bonds as part of its efforts to stimulate the economy. He did not offer any clues, however, as to when the federal funds rate, now 0.25 percent, might be lifted. John Stoltzfus, chief market strategist at Oppenheimer & Company, noted that whenever the Fed does raise short-term rates, ""it could create a jostle in the stock market."" But Mr. Stoltzfus warned investors not to assume that Fed increases would immediately pull the plug on the bull market.",The stock market has done well even as interest rates have recently climbed — a challenge to a popular notion.,57c9c9f8-27ac-5968-9002-5e43f2f176fe,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/02/business/2-FUND/2-FUND-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=552&w=600&s=4e26ccdf798eb5c631b52632dcc02cf8cc7a45769f876269fc2336f44faa79ee&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Ben S.

Art & Design,From Doodling on Napkins to Acres of Art,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/arts/design/show-us-your-wall-hans-van-de-bovenkamp-long-island.html,"Where do we start? You have art everywhere.

Let's start in the living room. You know, I feel deep connections to art and also to objects that have mythological meaning. I learned a lot about mythology from Joseph Campbell, my neighbor upstate. I also have gotten to know so many artists who became friends. Some have passed away, like de Kooning. Bill and I were neighbors in the Springs -- and friends when he was sober. He lived about 100 feet away, through the woods. I'd hear a knock at the door at night and it would be Bill. He'd paint in the middle of the night under the light of one light bulb. Then he wouldn't like it. He'd take his knife out and scrape off all the paint.

How did you come by the Picassos?

The Picassos were woodblocks and etchings from the Vollard Suite [a celebrated series of neoclassical works, named after the art dealer who commissioned them]. I also have a Monet etching of Baudelaire and a Chagall artist proof, all bought in various galleries in Arizona and Los Angeles in the late '60s. The works were grossly underpriced. I did not have much money and bought them with a credit card.

My wife, Siv Cedering, was the artist. She passed away. She was a writer, poet and painter from Lapland. She wrote 27 books. She died in the bed upstairs in my arms, about 12 years ago. I still feel her presence.

What's this? Looks like a birdhouse.

It's a Buddhist birdhouse, a gift to me. You see the pagoda concept? Here is a bell and inside is a tiny Buddha. [Laughing] I don't know if there are any Buddhist birds.

What's the sound of one wing flapping?

Tell me about your progress as a painter.

I use the same undulating shapes as I do in sculpture, but with color -- although I do black paintings too. The paintings are primarily energy. Somebody suggested that looking at the colors I chose, I must be colorblind. I'm definitely out of the box. Here's one of my paintings, where the scales of a fish turn into a landscape.

Fashion & Style,The Highly Unlikely Yet Totally Predictable Return of Uggs,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/fashion/the-highly-unlikely-yet-totally-predictable-return-of-uggs.html,"It started with Rihanna, as these things so often do. It was the halcyon days of 2018 and the pop singer and fashion icon wore a pair of Uggs to -- where else? -- the Coachella music festival. Not your average pair, like the classic boots made famous by a Juicy Couture-clad Lindsay Lohan at the height of her Us Weekly fame in the early aughts. This pair was a collaboration with the Belgian designer Glenn Martens of the avant-garde label Y/Project, who exploded the ostentatiously unsexy style to Brobdingnagian proportions, yielding a version that was high-heeled, slouchy and reached well above mid-thigh. A picture of Rihanna in the wader-like footwear amassed more than 3.3 million likes on Instagram, and even Vogue couldn't resist their strange allure. ""The C.F.O. was not super-excited about them,"" Andrea O'Donnell, the Ugg brand president, recalled. After seeing a CNN news segment of the Y/Project runway show in which they were unveiled, ""he came in and said, 'Tell me that I didn't see thigh-high boots, on a catwalk, worn by a man,'"" she said, laughing. Ms. O'Donnell had been hired in 2016 to help reposition the brand with consumers who associated Ugg with the classic boot in its purest form: shin-high, slip-on, mocha brown and lined in sheepskin. It was a casual style, to be worn with yoga pants while running errands. Ugg wanted to widen its image to encompass more fashion-forward associations.

And Ugg had lost its luster. Once the boot du jour for carefree socialites and off-duty starlets, it had become part of the uniform of a certain upwardly mobile consumer with bland bourgeoisie taste. The label was hardly the first to experience this trajectory. It's a common one in fashion: Things that once had an air of exclusivity and mystique are then fully absorbed by the culture. Uggs were beloved but mass market. Ms. O'Donnell, who came from the luxury department store Lane Crawford, moved to Santa Barbara, Calif., where Deckers, the Ugg parent company, is based, and got down to work, initiating a series of high-profile collaborations to inject some glamour into the label. ""We needed to engage the fashion community about what our brand could be,"" Ms. O'Donnell said. She has since assembled a roster of collaborations that are as eclectic as they are eccentric. Far from tapping, say, luxury labels in the European mold (recent partnerships between Prada and Adidas or Dior and Nike Air Jordan come to mind), Ugg chose designers with edgier, artier inclinations, which helped reinforce what Ms. O'Donnell said is the brand's potential to be both aspirational and accessible. ""Ugg really needed to reinvent itself,"" said Ayako Homma, an analyst at the market research firm Euromonitor International, citing market saturation and counterfeits as reasons for waning consumer interest. ""And collaborations are a great way to revamp the brand image by bringing in new styles and new consumers -- especially teens and younger adults, many of whom may not be familiar with the brand or haven't owned a pair before.""

Last year, the arty bicoastal duo behind Eckhaus Latta made clunky square-toed clogs and mules, and the louche streetwear label Stampd created a convertible pair that could transform from slippers to boots, which the website Highsnobiety called ""peak work from home footwear."" Next up are the British designer Molly Goddard, she of the tulle extravaganzas, who showed platform mules, shaggy slippers and boots with floral appliques at her spring 2021 show, and the Brooklyn designer Telfar Clemens, whose patchwork, logo-strewn boots (plus bedazzled T-shirts, oversize hoodies and fur-lined bucket hats) will be released next year. ""They are basically an accessible luxury,"" said Mr. Clemens, who has upended old ideas about gender and identity. ""It's a Christmas list thing for hundreds of thousands of people. That's the sort of space we want to occupy."" Department stores known for their discerning product mix, like Nordstrom and the Canadian retailer SSENSE, have taken notice and started to carry the limited-edition releases. ""The totally unexpected nature of the collaborations continues to keep the brand relevant,"" said Brian Costello, the vice president and merchandise manager for women's shoes at Nordstrom. And while the limited editions generate excitement within targeted communities, they do so without alienating fans of the core collection.

Ms. O'Donnell, whose first memory of the brand is Pamela Anderson wearing Uggs with her red ""Baywatch"" swimsuit (Ms. Anderson, an animal-rights activist, has since renounced the boots), calls the classic boot a ""cultural icon."" That sort of talk is often ballyhoo, but in this she's not wrong. Uggs permeated the zeitgeist in a way few other footwear brands can claim. Oprah Winfrey included them in her annual ""Favorite Things"" episodes, starting in 2003, creating a frenzy. Celebrities often wore them between takes while filming, which continued to raise their profile. And starlets helped forge an image of them as glamorous and casual in the early part of the century. Originally they were worn by surfers to keep their feet warm after a morning of wave-riding, giving them instant street (beach?) cred. Still, without constant tending and innovation, a brand built around one signature item can easily get stuck in a rut. ""Uggs will always and forever remind me of coming of age in the early aughts, seeing them on celebrities like Jessica Simpson on 'Newlyweds' or Paris Hilton shopping at Kitson,"" said Tyler McCall, the editor in chief of the Fashionista website. ""Lately, though, they also bring up images of a very specific, cool-art-scene kid.""

""With the internet, it feels like there is a dizzying number and array of fashion circles, and Ugg has made its way into a few of them,"" Ms. McCall said. ""Whether it's people interested in these buzzy collaborations or those who want to wear them with a sort of nod-wink ironic nudge to that millennial aesthetic."" While the collaborations have been able to whip up excitement in the fashion community, serendipitous outside forces have added to Ugg's recent good fortune. It is one of few fashion brands poised to benefit from the novel coronavirus as stay-at-home orders and mandated quarantines created a surge in popularity for cozy apparel and accessories, like sweats and house slippers. Uggs may be just the regression we all need in these times. Additionally, nostalgia for trends from the early aughts has experienced a renaissance in recent years, fueling a fervor for Puma sneakers, Prada nylon bags and other brands of the era. And while Uggs have been derided by some as downright unattractive, ugly shoes are popular in certain cool-kid circles. Ms. Homma of Euromonitor likened Ugg's trajectory to the ascent of another ugly-covetable shoe: Crocs. In its most recent quarterly earnings call, in late October, Ugg reported a modest increase in net sales, at 2.5 percent. Ms. Homma noted that, considering the challenging retail environment of the last year, that figure actually reads as quite resilient.",How Ugg learned to play the high-fashion game.,3f1f7bac-f05f-505b-8c5b-1cd9a49ac9d6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/09/fashion/09UGG-1/09UGG-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,Reconsidering Uggs.,3f1f7bac-f05f-505b-8c5b-1cd9a49ac9d6,N24News/imgs/3f1f7bac-f05f-505b-8c5b-1cd9a49ac9d6.jpg,19
Science,How Dangerous Is It to Be a Bird in Your City? Buildings Kill Hundreds of Millions a Year,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/science/birds-killed-by-buildings.html,"How Dangerous Is It to Be a Bird in Your City? Buildings Kill Hundreds of Millions a Year

Every year, millions of birds migrating at night, often distracted by bright city lights, die by flying into American buildings. Now a study shows where they may be most at risk -- and how efforts to save them might be honed. Chicago, Houston and Dallas are the most dangerous cities for birds traveling at night based on their prime location along one of North America's busiest migratory routes and the light pollution that they produce, according to the new research. ""The lights will pull those birds in, they'll circle and they'll become disoriented,"" said Kyle Horton, a postdoctoral researcher at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the lead author of the study, published this month in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment. Over all, scientists estimate that anywhere from 365 million to nearly a billion birds are killed in such accidents each year in the United States. And while researchers are still investigating the causes, experts believe that many can be attributed to the disorienting allure of artificial light.

[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Lights can confuse birds, causing them to fly into one another or a structure. They can also prompt the birds to fly in circles, burning through precious energy reserves stored up for the sometimes long migratory journey. To better understand that danger, Dr. Horton and his colleagues set out to identify the cities where the greatest numbers of birds encounter the most artificial light during nighttime migration. ""Coming up with rankings was priority No. 1: Where are the greatest threats and how do those threats vary by season?"" he said. To measure light pollution, he and his colleagues collected monthly NASA satellite snapshots over six years. To measure migration, they analyzed activity recorded at nearly 150 weather radar stations over more than two decades.

The researchers also found that, on average, about half of all migrating birds pass through a given city over six nights in the spring and seven nights in the fall. (The nights are not necessarily consecutive.) That, Dr. Horton said, could help direct efforts to save the birds. ""Minimal changes can have a big consequence,"" he said. ""We don't expect that cities are going to turn their lights off for 90 straight days, but if they were willing to do it in a dynamic way -- they were willing to do it for seven nights -- that could be quite impactful."" It is still not fully understood why birds find artificial lights so disorienting, but the phenomenon has long been documented. Bird deaths have been observed at lighthouses, for example, for more than a century. About a decade ago, several researchers, including Dr. Horton, found an opportunity to study the phenomenon up close: From 2008 to 2016, they observed birds around the annual Sept. 11 ""Tribute in Light Memorial"" in Manhattan, in which two bright pillars of light illuminate the night sky. The results, which they published in 2017, showed that when the lights, which stretch for up to four miles, were on, birds gathered around them in greater densities, flew in circles and vocalized loudly. During brief periods in which the lights were shut off, however, the birds quickly resumed normal behavior. Since the late 1990s, New York City Audubon has collected reports on dead birds in the region to better understand the problem. From 1997 to 2011, the species with the most fatal accidents with buildings was the white-throated sparrow, the group found.",A new study shows how efforts to prevent migrating birds from flying into skyscrapers and other brightly lit buildings could be honed.,bae37e3d-aae2-5a60-8db2-69329de8c00f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/11/science/11xp-birds-print/09xp-birds1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=a8db07820c39465a7e063b887a6890a9332ad7631c4bdc3fb37d28ff321b333f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The white-throated sparrow is among the birds most commonly found dead from flying into buildings in New York, according to New York City Audubon.",bae37e3d-aae2-5a60-8db2-69329de8c00f,N24News/imgs/bae37e3d-aae2-5a60-8db2-69329de8c00f.jpg,2
Travel,Bringing a Destination Wedding Within a Family's Reach,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/travel/frugal-family-destination-wedding.html,"This is the first of a column every other month by the writer Freda Moon that will explore the challenges and joys of traveling with a child on a tight budget. Rolling down the window of our hulking S.U.V. taxi for the mustachioed guard, I felt a flash of anguish. My husband, infant daughter and I were at the entrance to Punta Mita, a gated community and hotel complex occupying 1,500 acres of the Punta de Mita peninsula 25 miles north of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. ""We're on the list,"" I told the gatekeeper in rusty traveler's Spanish. After waiting an awkward few moments, we were granted access to a private road lined with meticulously groomed medians, planted palms interspersed with bougainvillea and golf-cart crossing signs. As we drove in, a truckload of landscapers was being driven out, crowded in the back of a flatbed, like a small-scale deportation. Tim and I glanced at each other. What was this place? At the hotel, we were greeted by a butler, ushered into a chauffeured cart and escorted through the terraced property to the pristine beach below. I felt like a dignitary. We had come to Punta Mita for a three-day beach fiesta celebrating the marriage of a childhood friend and her sweetheart of many years. It was a party I felt strongly about attending. One of my favorite people was marrying a charming man in my beloved Mexico, and I was determined to go. But after their original venue fell through, the wedding party was booked at the luxurious St. Regis, where the rack rate for a room was more than $500 (and the discounted group rate wasn't much less). For our two-writer household, the parents of an infant, it was a challenge -- an exercise in logistical acrobatics, in budgetary gamesmanship.

Almost since the moment I learned I was pregnant, I had pictured my daughter's first trip to Mexico. I saw myself chasing her around a village square -- surrounded by multigenerational families and the polka beat of Norteno -- until well past a reasonable bedtime at home. I fantasized about introducing her to the broad expanse of Mexican food, the monarch butterflies in Michoacan, the ruins of Cantona and the apartment in Mexico City where Tim and I had lived briefly. But during our time in the ""Riviera Nayarit,"" as the coastline of Nayarit state is marketed, I couldn't shake the feeling that we had traveled thousands of miles and somehow landed on a particularly photogenic corner of Orange County. It was disorienting. Still, I loved that my friend and her groom had planned their wedding in a place far from the staid setting of a church. I loved that Mexico means as much to them as it does to me, even if this Mexico wasn't my Mexico. I was, of course, prepared for mishaps and hiccups. Nobody expects the first international trip with an infant to be carefree. And even before takeoff, we had made the kinds of mistakes that lead budget travelers into trouble: waiting too long to start the passport process for my daughter, which meant having to pay an extra $60 expediting fee, for example. Or not realizing that while Delta Air Lines doesn't charge for an ""infant in arms"" plane ticket, we're still responsible for the not-insignificant tax the Mexican government charges for every foreign passenger.

Then there are routine catastrophes, like my then-8-month-old Roxie needing an all-hands-on-deck clothing and diaper change just as our Lyft car arrived, predawn, to take us to the airport. Already running late, Tim and I spent 20 minutes scrubbing Roxie with wet wipes on the seat of a parked car, in the near dark, while our driver paced. The gratuity on this degree of patience is not optional. And it's not cheap. Unanticipated expenses notwithstanding, we had made it to Punta Mita. At the welcome dinner, servers in white guayaberas circulated with platters of barbecued meat and bottomless bottles of Mexican wine. Long tables were set up on a beach planted with tiki torches. For dessert, there was a fire pit and a s'mores station.

Unlike the rocky shore at the town beach, the St. Regis had immaculate sand. While the public beaches were crowded with families, stray dogs, surfers, snow birds and hawkers selling everything from flan to mass-produced tchotchkes and handmade stuffed animals, the resort's beach was tranquil. It was beautiful, if character-less. Even so, unanticipated costs continued. Having traveled widely in Mexico, I've come to prefer public transit and hired drivers to rental cars. But unlike elsewhere in the country, on the Nayarit coast the cost of taxis rivaled those in Manhattan (950 pesos, or about $52, for the 20-mile trip from the airport to our hotel; another 100 pesos for each 1.75-mile taxi ride between our hotel and the St. Regis). We would have been better off renting a car, as the bride's sister did, through Gecko, a local company with relatively affordable rates (though still significantly higher than those of similar companies in the United States) and free airport pickup and drop-off. After three days of floating with Roxie in swimming pools, eating paletas (Mexican-style ice pops) and bonding with our fellow guests over tamarind margaritas, the wedding day arrived. Unsure what to do about child care for the ceremony and reception, I had counted on there being veteran parents, moms and dads who knew what they were doing and with whom, I hoped, we could share a babysitter or take turns watching one another's children. There was passing talk of my friend connecting us with the few other families making the trip, but I was reluctant to bother her with parental-matchmaking in the weeks leading up to her wedding. In the end, planning ahead seemed like more trouble than it was worth. So I put my faith in the travel gods. But ultimately there was only one other couple -- the bride's sister and brother-in-law -- who brought their toddler to what, I began to worry, was not meant to be a family-friendly affair.

It was embarrassing. But because the bride and groom are gracious -- and because so many of their friends have children (albeit children surrendered, wisely, to caregivers for the weekend) -- our missteps were greeted with humor and kindness. Nobody, it seemed, had seen an 8-month-old behave so well in the face of such incompetent parents. On the Saturday of the wedding, the rest of the guests took a shuttle from the hotel and Tim, Roxie and I caught a ride with the bride's family. We bounced along a rough road in the back seat of their rented pickup before reaching a private house outside Sayulita, a half-hour or so north of Punta Mita. A Swiss Family Robinson-esque mansion built into a hill above a sweeping sandy beach, with a bridge of unmilled branches and a large amoeba-shaped infinity pool, it felt like an extravagant treehouse in the palms. Tim and I settled on a plan: He would skip the ceremony, sitting with Roxie in a balconied room while I watched my friend walk down the aisle. Afterward, we would put Roxie down to sleep in her PeaPod, an ingenious pop-up tent-bed I found on Craigslist, nearly unused, for $40. We could keep an eye on her -- via the modern miracle of smartphone baby monitor apps -- while we ate dinner, sipped tequila and danced to wedding D.J. classics. The ceremony was on the beach, with the Pacific putting on a show in the background and the sun scorching overhead. It was gorgeous and to the point. Afterward, a line of mariachis appeared from nowhere, erupting in a wall of sound. Our small crowd retreated from the heat into a clearing in the palms, where a dance floor, bar and open-air banquet hall had been erected for the occasion. As everyone else was sitting down for dinner, Tim and I changed and shushed Roxie and got her ready for bed. Just as her eyelids fluttered to sleep, we discovered that our monitors, which relied on Internet access, weren't able to connect. For the first time in four days, we were out of range. There was nothing we could do. At 8 months, Roxie was determined to join the party. Tim strapped her to his chest, her wispy curls overflowing from the canvas carrier. We held our breath through speeches and prayers, silently pleading with Roxie to keep quiet. (She did.) But as the night wore on, drinks were downed and the dance floor filled with 30-somethings on reprieve from responsibility, nobody seemed to mind our tiny wedding-crasher. At one point, I looked over and saw the bridegroom and his friends -- fellow men of accomplishment, M.B.A.-holders with serious jobs -- serenading Roxie to Journey's ""Don't Stop Believing."" It may not have been the Mexico of my memory, but some travel isn't about the place you're going. It's about the people you're traveling for. By that measure, our Mexico trip was a triumph -- and we still managed to keep our baby up way past a reasonable bedtime.","With an infant in tow, a thrifty couple learns that a beach fiesta and wedding in Mexico are exercises in budgetary gamesmanship.",5592fdcb-3847-51bf-9610-ddf532414fcb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/22/travel/22FRUGAL2/22FRUGAL2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=a05eafa70ccb1b5504a8fcc546c10f1c94c63c8de5fc881db9cdffff7f076f46&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An oceanfront pool at the St. Regis Punta Mita Resort.,5592fdcb-3847-51bf-9610-ddf532414fcb,N24News/imgs/5592fdcb-3847-51bf-9610-ddf532414fcb.jpg,4
Travel,How the Snow Storm Is Affecting Travel,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/travel/how-the-east-coast-storm-is-affecting-weekend-travel.html,"The winter storm that has hit the East Coast this weekend has scrambled travel plans, leading to 10,850 flight cancellations and more than 5,000 delays since Friday, according to FlightAware. Airlines, ground transportation providers, hotels and attractions are all adjusting their schedules and policies. The following is what's happening so far. Flights to and from Philadelphia International Airport have been canceled on Saturday. The three major Washington, D.C., airports, Washington Dulles International, Reagan National and Baltimore-Washington International, are not operating flights. And all three New York airports, La Guardia, J.F.K. and Newark, have canceled flights. The flight delays and cancellations have rippled across the country. Airports from Chicago's O'Hare to Los Angeles International are experiencing significant delays, according to Flightstats.com. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was the hardest hit beyond the Northeast, with flights leaving an average 43 minutes late on Saturday. American Airlines was the hardest hit of the carriers, cancelling almost one third of its flights Saturday (896 flights) and a total of 1,720 flights Friday and Saturday.

American Airlines canceled all flights to, from and through Charlotte Douglas International Airport on Friday and plans to resume limited operations on Saturday afternoon. It has canceled all flights to and from all three major New York area airports, including Newark. It plans to resume operations at those airports Sunday. United has been affected as well and has canceled all its operations at Newark Airport, one of its hubs, and plans to resume them on Sunday. Most airlines are encouraging passengers slated to travel this weekend to rebook rather than wait out a cancellation at an airport. To do so, they are waiving the normal fees for booking changes. Passengers whose flights are canceled are entitled to a refund from their carrier. American, Delta, United, JetBlue, Southwest and others have announced fee waivers for rebooking in select cities Jan. 22 to 24. Amtrak is operating a modified schedule in the Northeast this weekend. Among cancellations, the Cardinal train from New York to Chicago is canceled for Saturday, and the Crescent from New York to New Orleans will not operate Friday or Saturday. Other cancellations will be listed on Amtrak's website; its refund and exchange policy is found here. Megabus has canceled many East Coast routes for Jan. 22 and 23 and says it has notified affected travelers via email. Passengers booked on Megabus this weekend can log onto the site with their reservation number, email address and credit card used to make the booking to determine if their trip is canceled.

Greyhound canceled service between New York and Washington, Philadelphia and Norfolk, Va.; Philadelphia and Washington and Pittsburgh; Washington and Richmond, Va., and Pittsburgh; Richmond and Fayetteville and Charlotte, N.C., and Knoxville, Tenn.; Columbus, Ohio, and Charlotte; Baltimore and Atlantic City; and Norfolk and Virginia Beach. Passengers will be rebooked on the next available bus once service resumes. While hotel airports are likely to fill with stranded passengers, hotels in some affected areas are reacting to the storm with deals. The Omni Homestead Resort in Hot Springs, Va., is offering all in-house guests a rate of $99 a night to stay past their scheduled departure in order to avoid travel during the storm. In Washington, the Jefferson hotel is offering 20 percent off room rates Jan. 22 to 24. And the Embassy Row Hotel, a Destination Hotel, is offering rooms for $99 a night, including Wi-Fi, to those using the booking code JONAS. In New York, the Loews Regency Hotel is offering a special snow rate from $229 a night on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights (book using the code SNOW to get the deal). The hotel will entertain guests in-house with games available in the bar, coloring books and crayons for children and adults, cocktail deals and two loaner sleds for guests to use in Central Park. The hotel has had about $15,000 in cancellations over the past two days. More staycation incentives from Sixty SoHo hotel: 25 percent off rates this weekend. The Gregory hotel in Herald Square and the Renwick in Midtown are waving cancellation fees this weekend and are offering extended checkouts, extra blankets fireside in the lobby and free hot cider on Saturday and Sunday. More deals in New York include: The Hyatt Times Square is offering 15 percent off rooms today until Sunday by using this link and signing up for My Hyatt loyalty program. Rates start at $144. The Royalton near Bryant Park is offering rooms from $199 with free Wi-Fi, late checkout and complimentary cocktails (use the booking code SNOWDAYSANCTUARY). In Arlington, Va., the Ritz-Carlton, Pentagon City is offering weekend rates from $189 including parking, breakfast for two and in-room movies. The Ritz-Carlton Washington, D.C. is offering rooms from $249.

In Boston, the XV Beacon is offering 15 percent off rates this weekend. Marriott International is waiving fees for all weather-related cancellations. Still, travelers are better off informing their hotels and asking for a fee waiver rather than letting the automatic penalty for a no-show to kick in. Virgin Hotels in Chicago issued the following statement: ""Our general policy is that if you let us know that you need to cancel, no sweat. But if you don't let us know, then there is a charge of one night of your reservation rate plus tax."" In Washington, national park visitor facilities overseen by the National Capital Regional Office, including sites on the National Mall, President's Park at the White House, Harpers Ferry National Historical Park in West Virginia and along the George Washington Memorial Parkway, closed at noon Eastern Friday. The Washington Monument, like others on the National Mall, will be closed until at least Monday, Jan. 25, and will not be staffed by rangers, though U.S. Park Police will be on duty. Restrooms around the National Mall will also be closed. Arlington National Cemetery will be closed to visitors Saturday and Sunday. Arlington House, the Robert E. Lee Memorial, closed Friday morning and will remain closed through Sunday. In New York, there is a travel ban, and many attractions are closed, including the city's public libraries, zoos and aquarium. The city has suspended bus service, and has halted service on above-ground subways. And Broadway theaters, which throughout much of the day had planned for its shows to go on, announced that all shows were canceled on Saturday, the Broadway League said.","Thousands of flights have been canceled, a travel ban is in place in New York, and some hotels are offering specials for snowed-in travelers.",bc040f09-cae1-592f-8534-347e3b8df1ba,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/22/travel/22travelblizzard-laguardia/22travelblizzard-laguardia-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=90c408d6e188b5573ad0fde88b05dd184631d85774de8c9ad71b5acd9b58dbdf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A board at La Guardia in New York tells a storm story.,bc040f09-cae1-592f-8534-347e3b8df1ba,N24News/imgs/bc040f09-cae1-592f-8534-347e3b8df1ba.jpg,4
Opinion,Don't Credit the G.O.P. on Climate Change Just Yet,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/opinion/letters/republicans-climate.html,"Re ""Is the G.O.P. Getting Serious About Climate Change?,"" by Ericka Andersen (Op-Ed, Aug. 8):

The proposals that are cited as evidence of the Republicans' turnaround on climate change focus on carbon capture, which allows polluters to keep burning fossil fuels so long as they capture their emissions.

But carbon capture has not been proved to work efficiently, cost-effectively or at scale, nor does it offer relief to the communities whose health has been devastated by decades of exposure to fossil fuels. Though natural carbon capture -- protecting forests, restoring wetlands -- will likely be part of a solution to climate change, there is no path away from the climate crisis that relies solely on capturing carbon.

Given the brief window we have left to avert catastrophic warming, we must deploy proven solutions like clean energy and not wait for carbon capture to become our deus ex machina. When Republicans stop blocking and delaying these solutions, I'll be ready to say the party has truly changed.

Media,Tensions Flare Between Trump and Fox News,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/30/business/media/trump-fox-news.html,"Tensions between the White House and Fox News ratcheted up this week after President Trump declared that the network was letting his supporters down and two on-air personalities said they ""don't work"" for him. The back-and-forth began Wednesday when Mr. Trump took to Twitter to rebuke the network for airing an interview with Xochitl Hinojosa, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee. Mr. Trump said Ms. Hinojosa was ""heavily promoting"" Democratic candidates with ""zero pushback"" from the anchor, Sandra Smith. ""They should go all the way LEFT and I will still find a way to Win - That's what I do, Win,"" he wrote.

Referring to the network as ""the new Fox News,"" he continued by saying the network ""is letting millions of GREAT people down!"" ""We have to start looking for a new News Outlet,"" he added. ""Fox isn't working for us anymore!"" This was not the first time that Mr. Trump had expressed frustration with Fox News, but it was eye-opening. The president has good relationships with many of Fox's on-air personalities, including the hosts of ""Fox & Friends,"" Sean Hannity, Jeanine Pirro and Laura Ingraham. His former spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, signed on as a Fox News contributor last week. But whether this is a sign of genuine deterioration in relations between the president and his preferred cable channel or a short-lived dust-up will be closely watched by news executives and throughout the Beltway.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. On Thursday, two on-air personalities responded to Mr. Trump's tweets. Neil Cavuto, an anchor for Fox News and Fox Business Network who has been critical of Mr. Trump in the past, said on the air: ""Mr. President, we don't work for you. I don't work for you. My job is to cover you, not fawn over you or rip you. Just report on you -- to call balls and strikes on you. My job, Mr. President -- our job here -- is to keep score, not settle scores."" ""You're entitled to your point of view, Mr. President,"" he continued. ""But you're not entitled to your own set of facts.""

Brit Hume, a senior political analyst for Fox News, echoed Mr. Cavuto's comments and tweeted, ""Fox News isn't supposed to work for you."" ""We have tried to be fair to him in our news coverage,"" Mr. Hume said in another tweet responding to someone who had asked why Mr. Trump thought Fox worked for him. ""Best example: we didn't fall for the Russia conspiracy theory that ended in such a fiasco for other outlets. Plus, some of our opinion hosts support Trump. (Others don't.)"" Fox News declined to comment for this article. The White House declined to comment on Mr. Trump's complaints about Fox News or Mr. Cavuto's retort, preferring to leave the sparring to the president himself. While in office, Mr. Trump has reserved his most cantankerous barbs for other news outlets. This week alone, he has attacked The New York Times, The Washington Post, Axios and NBC. But the president has increased his criticism of Fox News in recent months. On Sunday, he said the network was ""not what it used to be"" when he expressed unhappiness with a poll. He has also attacked the Fox News contributor Donna Brazile, the anchors Shepard Smith and Chris Wallace, and the Fox analyst Juan Williams. Early this month, Mr. Trump said that ""watching Fake News CNN"" was better than watching Mr. Smith's show and that ""whenever possible"" he turned to the One America News Network. When Mr. Wallace interviewed the Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg in May, Mr. Trump said Fox News was ""moving more and more to the losing side."" By Friday afternoon, it appeared that Mr. Trump had other targets on his mind. Over the course of two hours, he had tweeted four videos on the Justice Department's critical inspector general report regarding the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey. All four clips featured guests criticizing Mr. Comey, and all four clips were from Fox News.","President Trump expressed frustration with his preferred cable channel this week, prompting two on-air personalities to say they ""don't work"" for him.",d583f4a2-ed6d-5b02-a507-0aeafabc6375,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/30/business/30FOXTRUMP-01/30FOXTRUMP-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=4a05af65bea2f5919fd5c97349ce00a694bf90fa67791e70644b412446d1cdbd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,President Trump has increased his criticism of Fox News in recent months.,d583f4a2-ed6d-5b02-a507-0aeafabc6375,N24News/imgs/d583f4a2-ed6d-5b02-a507-0aeafabc6375.jpg,16
Art & Design,Yemen Asks U.S. for Help to Curb Smuggling of Looted Ancient Artifacts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/arts/design/yemen-united-states-looted-artifacts.html,"A man surveys the damage to the Taiz National Museum in Yemen after shelling in 2016.

Yemen's deputy culture minister, Abdulhadi al-Azazi, remembers standing two years ago amid the rubble of a national museum in his war-torn hometown, Taiz. Objects he had admired as a youngster -- ancient limestone carvings, gilded Torah scrolls, bejeweled Islamic daggers, a spindly 2,500-year-old mummy -- were missing amid the charred debris and shattered display cases. ""The museum was wrecked and everything was stolen,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""Everywhere in our country we see the same thing happening now."" Some four years into a civil war in which members of a Northern Yemeni faction known as Houthis have fought Saudi-backed Yemeni forces to a stalemate, the extent of the human suffering has drawn global attention. Less noticed have been the cultural institutions and archaeological relics lost or ravaged during the conflict, including thousands of antiquities taken from Yemen's museums.

[Read more about the humanitarian crisis in Yemen.] In an effort to recover some of the items, Yemeni officials visited Washington and New York in recent days to ask the Trump administration and the United Nations to help them forestall the scattering of a heritage that stretches back nearly 4,000 years. Their central request is that the United States issue an emergency order that would bar the import of Yemeni artifacts that did not carry special documentation. Typically, antiquities from abroad cannot enter the country without documentation mandated in one-on-one agreements between the nation of origin and the United States. Because Yemen is not party to any such agreement, its artifacts simply need to be declared at customs in a routine way. The Saudi-backed Yemeni government hopes the United States will impose new rules requiring importers to show proof that the objects had been legally obtained. That proof could be in the form of a government authorization or documents proving that the items had a well-established provenance trail dating from before the civil war. ""Yemen was a cradle to many civilizations and a home to multiple faiths, particularly Judaism, Christianity and Islam, which all thrived here,"" Yemen's culture minister, Marwan Dammaj, said in New York on Wednesday. He denounced the pillaging as ""a gross affront to humanity at large.""

Nonetheless, the United States has in recent years issued emergency orders on behalf of Iraq, Syria, Libya and Mali. In the case of Syria, for example, Congress voted to impose the restrictions in 2016 after terrorist groups were found to be profiteering from the country's antiquities to pay for weapons and recruitment. The Yemenis say they have strong evidence that their artifacts are being sold off by Houthi fighters and by terrorist groups like Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and the Islamic State, which infiltrated the country during its current turmoil. To bolster those claims, Mr. Dammaj circulated a 290-page report in Arabic and English that details the looting at the Aden National Museum, the Taiz National Museum and the National Museum of Zinjibar. The marble head of a horse, thought to have been created between 1,000 B.C. and 800 B.C., that was taken from the Zinjibar Museum in Yemen. Accompanying it is a catalog of 1,631 objects missing from the museums. The list includes items that stretch back into the depths of civilization in a region known as a vital early trading crossroads, including ivory figurines from the ancient Kingdom of Saba (the mythic realm of the Queen of Sheba); Roman-era golden coins and marble statuettes; and brass finials and Hebrew manuscripts from the many centuries when Jews populated what is now southern Arabia. ""It is clear that violent extremists are plundering our treasures and smuggling them overseas,"" said Mr. Dammaj, who met with State and Treasury Department officials, American law enforcement authorities and United Nations representatives.

State Department officials said the agency is studying the request. ""It is important that we take steps now to prevent the further degradation of invaluable cultural property and heritage sites in Yemen,"" the department said in a statement. ""We want to help prevent malign actors from profiting from the looting, theft and sale of conflict antiquities."" Also reported stolen from the Zinjibar Museum, this limestone sculpture is thought to date from 1000 to 800 B.C., during the time of the Kingdom of Saba. Mr. Dammaj said Houthis have been arrested several times in the act of smuggling antiquities and have been seen ransacking cultural sites. Although it is impossible to corroborate every allegation, independent groups that follow Yemen's plight have also cited a Houthi role in the sacking of some cultural sites. Mwatana, an independent Yemeni human rights group, has cited those forces in the looting of several museums, though it has also accused Saudi air forces of bombing cultural sites where they believed Houthi combatants had taken shelter. Last month, the Malaysia-based Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization assailed the Houthis for plundering manuscripts, historical texts and Islamic relics from the library of Zabid, Yemen's capital during the 13th and 15th centuries. Deborah Lehr, the chairwoman of the Antiquities Coalition, a Washington group that combats cultural racketeering and helped Yemen assemble and publish the English-language version of its report, said her group had been in contact with foreign archaeologists on the ground in Yemen who reported evidence of looting by the Houthi faction.",Yemeni officials say they need help in recovering artifacts that have been looted from ancient sites and museums during the ongoing civil war.,b618d46b-eabc-5253-814d-8de93e98f037,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/06/arts/06looting2/06looting2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=0e37b17c02b5599fc45bc5ff89336695d8d997edcdcf73158a471cc04bee3c99&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Marwan Dammaj, the culture minister of Yemen, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Wednesday.",b618d46b-eabc-5253-814d-8de93e98f037,N24News/imgs/b618d46b-eabc-5253-814d-8de93e98f037.jpg,14
Your Money,New Worry for Home Buyers: A Party House Next Door,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/10/your-money/new-worry-for-home-buyers-a-party-house-next-door.html,"AUSTIN, TEX. -- The houses are often among the nicest on the block, or at least the biggest. They may be new construction where a smaller structure once stood, or an extensively renovated home with cheery paint in shades of yellow or blue. But then the telltale signs appear, including an electronic touch pad on the door that makes it easy for people to get in without a key. The ads on HomeAway or Airbnb eventually confirm it: A party house has come to the neighborhood. Some neighbors have warmed in recent years to travelers dragging suitcases through their residential neighborhoods, and they are happy that the visitors spread their money around. But when profit-seeking entrepreneurs furnish homes they do not live in to make them attractive to big groups and then rent out those houses as much as possible, parties and noise are nearly inevitable. And so it goes here in Austin, where a group of enraged and occasionally sleepless residents have taken their complaints to the city. Austin made rules in 2012 that were meant to keep short-term rentals under control, but the neighbors argue that many of the rules are unenforceable.

This week, I rented one of the most notorious party houses in Austin and invited some of the neighbors over for a chat to ask a few questions. Where do the rights of property owners to rent out their homes end, and where do those of quiet-loving neighbors begin? Do all home shoppers now need to be on the lookout for nearby problem properties? And if so, what might happen to home values when revelers can bunk up next door on any given night? These are not new questions. In resort areas in particular, people have been renting out investment properties for ages. What's new is how easy it has become for people to make money by listing rooms or homes and for visitors to save money by staying there. This is particularly true in good-time destinations like Austin, Nashville, New Orleans and other bigger cities.

When Austin tried to bring some order to the proceedings three years ago, it limited the number of unrelated people who could stay in one place at one time to six. (It also capped the number of certain listings in many neighborhoods, albeit with a loophole that has allowed many unregistered properties to hit the market.) Nevertheless, listings began appearing all over the city advertising beds for 10 or 15 people, or more. Austin has become a popular bachelor party destination, and the website Thrillist described one Airbnb listing as ""the perfect place to bed down for a bonkers bachelor party, as it's a short bike ride from downtown, just the right blend of weird & huge, and not at all unaccustomed to rowdy entertainment.""

Emmy Jodoin lives next door to that house with her family. ""It is loud, and there is live music and karaoke stuff, and it's all done outside because of the pool,"" she said. ""They're out in front at 4 in the afternoon waiting for their Uber to come, drunk on the front lawn."" Homeowners had other complaints about guests, including trash bins overflowing with beer cans, public urination, catcalling, foul language, racist remarks, companies throwing events and the appearance of a rainbow-colored painted pony. ""Sometimes, when they are outside, they're playing beer pong just wearing their underwear,"" said Hazel Oldt, age 11, who can see them next door from the third-floor rooftop garden of her house. Many of the complaints result when there are well over six people staying at these houses. So how do owners get away with renting to more people than city rules allow? ""Determining how many are occupying versus just visiting is almost impossible,"" Carl Smart, who is the director of Austin's code department, said, chuckling as he did so. What was so funny? Had some of the guests been coached to say that they were related? ""I think so,"" he said. ""There is no way for us to disprove or to prove it. We could ask them to, but they don't have to, so we have to take their word for it."" KVUE, a local television station, tagged along with code enforcement officers who heard from guests at one house that there were triplets inside and that someone else was related to a fifth guest by marriage. The neighbors would prefer that the city simply cap guests at six people -- or, better yet, stop allowing what they describe as rogue hotels to operate in residential neighborhoods. (They have no problem with people renting out their entire homes occasionally or renting rooms more frequently, while the owners themselves are in residence.)

Even if no one, in this instance, is doing any actual residing? HomeAway's contention is that the visitors coming for the weekend are the residents in this context. Mr. Curtis questioned how widespread the problem was. Airbnb provided some statistics about its customers, noting that from Oct. 1, 2014, to Oct. 1 this year, 87 percent of trips to Austin involved four or fewer people and 97 percent involved eight or fewer. The average age of Airbnb guests in Austin is 36. According to the research company Airdna, of the 1,414 Airbnb listings in Austin as of Aug. 31 with three or more bedrooms, 33 offer lodging for four or more people per bedroom while 618 sleep over two per bedroom. Airbnb offers a hotline for neighbors having problems with hosts anywhere it operates and is building tools that will try to recognize parties before they happen, say when someone books a large house and that listing is immediately viewed by many other site visitors. Since October 2012, Austin has received 266 complaints about the type of registered properties where the homeowner is generally not present. Twenty percent of the properties have at least one complaint, with an average of 2.4 complaints among those. Seventeen percent of the complaints were about over-occupancy. The house where I stayed has received 15 complaints, and the city has suspended its license once. The walls have ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Anchorman"" movie posters, and the three bedrooms are full of bunk beds and futons. ""Our neighbors understand that your group is here to have a good time,"" the listing says. But not too good a time. Each door to the outside has a framed copy of Austin's noise ordinance nearby, and Jason Martin, a limited partner with partial ownership in the property, sends an extensive list of house rules to guests urging them not to disturb the neighbors. ""It is extremely professionally run,"" he said. ""Any word of a bachelor party or fraternities is an immediate no-go.""

Those visitors were especially concerned about their property values. For many of them, their homes are their largest asset. Jessie Neufeld, who bought her home right before the local rules changed in 2012 and now has a 2-year-old child, put it most bluntly. ""We did not buy our house to be living next to a hotel,"" she said. ""Would you buy a home if you knew a hotel like this was operating next door, if you wanted to set your life up and raise a family?"" I put the question to two real estate professionals whose names I saw on for-sale signs for homes that were next to or close to some of the party houses. Were the properties going to sell for less because of the problem properties nearby, and did they have a duty to disclose these houses to any and all buyers? Katie Brigmon of Dash Realty did not want to answer many questions about her listing, a house that is very close to one problem property, and my call to her quickly went dead. Jeff Grant from Saddle Realty said that he wasn't aware of the short-term rental several homes down from the house he's trying to sell on Hidalgo Street. ""But my philosophy has always been disclose, disclose, disclose,"" he said. ""I don't think it affects property value in the least."" It probably won't if the buyer simply wants to rent out the home every weekend. But every other home buyer ought to be searching Airbnb, HomeAway and similar sites for listings that are close to a home that they're considering buying. Ms. Neufeld said she resented the fact that people making a living from renting out homes for the weekend have put her own home's value at risk. ""They are leveraging our neighborhood for their profit, telling people to come stay in this beautiful place where you would like to pretend that you live,"" she said. ""And they are making people miserable.""","The proliferation of short-term rentals offered by Airbnb, HomeAway and other websites has created problems in some good-time destinations like Austin, Tex.",037111f5-0644-570a-98d6-716dc60788a3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/10/business/10money-web1/10money-web1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=ab8c5fca0f856b9d2dd7b6406e4d75f8ea4ca71d9eba5220bb056022425667b6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"This home in Austin, Tex., has been the subject of 15 complaints related to groups who have rented it for short stays.",037111f5-0644-570a-98d6-716dc60788a3,N24News/imgs/037111f5-0644-570a-98d6-716dc60788a3.jpg,21
Your Money,When Teachers Face the Task of Fixing Their Retirement Accounts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/your-money/401ks-and-similar-plans/when-teachers-face-the-task-of-fixing-their-retirement-accounts.html,"When the Greenwich Alliance for Education held its annual trivia challenge last week, Carol Sutton worried a bit when the topic turned to finance. Ms. Sutton, the president of the teachers' union in Greenwich, Conn., and her table full of educators weren't quite equipped for the question about debentures. Other tables were quick to answer. It was a reminder, as if she needed one, that for all of the money smarts in the community, which is packed with hedge fund executives, she and her colleagues were still mostly on their own when trying to fix their 403(b) retirement savings plan. Accounts of this type, which are like 401(k)'s for nonprofit employees, educators and many hospital workers, often come with high fees and problematic investments, as Tara Siegel Bernard and I documented in our Public Sacrifice series last year. This week, Matthew Lesser, a Connecticut state representative who leads the House banking committee, held a hearing on a bill that he had written after reading the articles. He hopes to require more disclosures by retirement plan salespeople of conflicts of interest. Time will tell if legislation can pass and then help. Meanwhile, educators like Ms. Sutton are left to fend for themselves or lobby their school districts for assistance. Which means the system, as it stands, looks like this: We have essentially forced some of the people who do the most good in the world to turn themselves into part-time plan administrators who do annuity and mutual fund prospectus-reading on the side. Or at least that's what they need to be if they want something better for themselves.

Let's say that you're a new teacher in Greenwich. Yes, you have a shot at a pension, as long as you stick with teaching. But it may not be enough to support you in your old age. Not everyone is sure about staying with education, and not everyone trusts that underfunded pension plans will persist. Moreover, not everyone pays into Social Security, including teachers in Connecticut. If you don't pay in, you don't get a check for your own work for those years. Most people who take a step back and consider the above realize that they need another savings plan. That is where these 403(b)'s come in. When you start teaching in Greenwich, you receive instructions to visit the plan administrator's site. That administrator, Omni, presents a list of various investment vendors, with links to their home pages. There is no explanation there on how the plan works. No explanation on how the companies differ. No menu of investments. And no contact information for people who can explain anything to you. A befuddled (and annoyed) educator might then call the phone number for every one of the companies and ask for the investment menu, as I did this week through the companies' public relations representatives. Foresters Financial and Voya Financial would not provide the menu or answer any questions, and would not explain why they did not want to talk to me. (Foresters said it could not meet my deadline, which made me wonder: Does it take two days to respond to potential customers, too?) The Oldham Resource Group said it could not speak without permission from its custodian, GWN Securities. I had a brief conversation with its representative, who then did not respond to additional questions or inquiries about the reason for its reticence.

A hat tip to Axa, a provider of often expensive annuities, which you can read more about in one of Tara's 403(b) articles from last year. At least Axa engaged, letting me know that the Equi-Vest 201 variable annuity that it offers via a prospectus that runs 132 pages would cost a minimum of 1.81 percent annually in one version and possibly a fair bit more. Other options are complex in different ways and may not offer as much market upside. Those fees help pay for Axa's adviser force, and the company thinks that people who work with an adviser tend to start sooner, save more and make fewer mistakes than people who go at retirement investing alone. Want mutual funds? Only funds from Oppenheimer (and no index funds) are offered via Compass Capital Management, another company on the Omni list. It offers different classes of funds, and the best deal for investors tends to be those on which it pays half a percentage point a year to an adviser on top of whatever the underlying fund expenses are. Over all, these investments seemed best for most people in the Greenwich plan (keeping in mind that many of the companies on the list would not talk to me). But better deals do exist out in the world, and more teachers ought to have the opportunity to snare them. For instance, it should be easier to buy simple target-date mutual funds, the all-in-one funds that let you set an intended retirement date and then allocate money to a collection of index mutual funds that track the market and adjust risk according to your age. Ms. Sutton, the union president, said she was working on it. She has fired up her members to ask more questions of any adviser who is helping them with their 403(b)'s. Her finance committee is putting spreadsheets together and looking into other options, like a cheaper state plan that should be available to teachers but currently is not. But it's all a bit wearying, and it's not lost on her that the human resources employees at many corporations serve up cheap Fidelity and Vanguard mutual funds to colleagues on a silver platter. ""Some of us in the public sector are working our tails off; we hope for the good of humanity,"" she said. ""But we're not educated in this area.""

Joshua B. Gottfried, a financial planner in Connecticut, is one person who does know the turf. Of the 1,000 or so client families at his firm, 500 have an educator, including one who worked in Greenwich. He has tried to persuade districts to consolidate their 403(b) plans with one lower-cost provider but hasn't been successful. ""We get pushback from the teachers' union,"" he said of the local opposition that bubbles up. ""They don't want to restrict choice for their members."" Quite often, his advice to educators around the state is this, given that many plans are as questionable as the one in Greenwich or worse: Skip the 403(b) plan altogether and just open up a Roth individual retirement account at a low-cost brokerage firm like Vanguard. Young people, especially, may not benefit much from the tax break they get by putting away pretax money in a 403(b) as opposed to after-tax money in a Roth. It's a sad state of affairs when workplace retirement plans are so compromised that the best move is to avoid them. But it doesn't have to be this way. Our guide for intrepid employees who wish to fix their 403(b) is a good place to start if you are so inspired. Consult my list of 21 questions to ask about investment fees, too. Finally, press the investment companies that serve your employer. They may stonewall me, but you should not stand for it. Demand answers to your questions. If you don't want to pay 2 percent or more annually for an annuity that you do not understand, lobby your union or district for index mutual funds. And to all of you finance executives in Greenwich who had no idea what sort of challenges your teachers were facing until now: How about raising your hands to help those teachers fix this problem? You know where the world is going. Pensions, if you have them at all, aren't going to become more generous. Clearly, your health insurance isn't, either. So these supplemental savings plans can make all the difference between a comfortable retirement at the time when you want it and having to work far longer than you ever could have expected. Now, it's time to make them better.","In Greenwich, Conn., a town brimming with hedge fund managers, teachers have to study up on finance to try to find better investment options for retirement.",4443a0a4-ff79-5e7d-9023-b711e90089c5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/04/business/04MONEY-02/04MONEY-02-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=0dafea791d9d8e48fd33b0ea1c2b0654efe15f6b4a8828b903b1f1959aa7bd07&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Matthew Lesser, a Connecticut state representative, sponsored a bill that would require more disclosures on conflicts of interest by those who sell 403(b)-type retirement plans.",4443a0a4-ff79-5e7d-9023-b711e90089c5,N24News/imgs/4443a0a4-ff79-5e7d-9023-b711e90089c5.jpg,21
Automobiles,A Short Drive in the 2015 Audi A3 E-tron,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/automobiles/autoshow/a-short-drive-in-the-2015-audi-a3-e-tron.html,"Driving any car in the rush hour traffic that coats Los Angeles roads like a viscous layer of hair gel is a chore. You could have the fastest, fanciest, most cool looking car in the world, and you'd still be sitting in the same motoring morass as someone perched behind the wheel of a dented '92 Toyota Corolla.

What could possibly make that situation better? If the 2015 Audi A3 E-Tron, a plug-in hybrid that Audi showed off at the Los Angeles Auto Show, has anything to say about it, the answer is batteries. The A3 E-Tron's electric motor handles the around-town stuff, while its turbocharged 1.4-liter gasoline engine takes care of heavy acceleration and longer distance travel.

I drove one during rush hour, so there wasn't much opportunity to put the car through its paces. But that experience gave valuable insight into what it would be like to drive one in a crowded metropolitan area.

Sitting at red lights -- of which there were many -- the engine shut down and the car was quiet. Under normal acceleration, the electric motor, which is sandwiched between the engine and transmission, moved the car silently. During those brief moments when I saw the road open up ahead and was able to put more pressure on the accelerator pedal, the electric motor twisted the wheels quickly through the low end, leaving the top end of the r.p.m. range to the high-revving turbo gasoline engine. When I floored it, the gas engine kicked in, too, and the A3 E-Tron took off pretty quickly for such a small car.

In a couple of instances, the car jerked a little when switching from electric motor to gasoline engine power or vice versa. But for the most part, the only indication that anything was happening was the light buzz the 1.4-liter engine emits at higher r.p.m.

Along with boost mode, the A3 E-Tron has other driving modes, including electric, glide -- when the brakes are recovering energy for the battery pack - and hybrid hold, a selectable mode designed to preserve battery charge for later use. In all-electric mode, the E-Tron will reach a top speed of 81 miles per hour. Audi says the car's 8.8-kilowatt-hour battery pack provides 31 miles of pure electric range and the gasoline engine more than 550 miles of additional range. The automaker claims a zero to 62-mile-per-hour time of 7.6 seconds, which is believable, and fuel economy numbers topping 150 miles per gallon. That figure bears further real world exploration. Being that this small hybrid wagon was an Audi, it didn't surprise me that it handled well as I wove in and out of traffic. Its looks didn't surprise me either. Audi tends to build pretty cars, and the A3 E-Tron is no exception.","As more automakers get into the plug-in hybrid game, each one has a different approach.

Books,"In Defense of Poetic Nonsense, With a Character Who Shares Your Frustration",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/books/review/for-the-ride-alice-notley.html,"If you keep reading from left to right, it's meaningless. You have to change your strategy and read from top to bottom: this is a hand for form's sake. In another, letters form the shape of a mask or a human face. Curving columns of lower-case l's make the sides of the face. The last l leads into the words ""loss of""; the word ""identity"" forms the chin. The eyes are made of lower-case e's (e for eye), the nostrils are o's, the mouth a line of m's (m for mouth). Downward, the features spell ""eom"" (memo-ese for end of message). The satisfaction of ""solving"" these puzzles, or finding possible solutions, offers relief from the mystery of the rest, which might be unsolvable -- much like the real problems (climate disaster, ecological collapse) the book imagines us living, or not living, after.

If the book sounds maddening, it often is. It seems frustrated with itself: ""oh that's just more words,"" Notley writes; ""how tedious, this!"" The tedium might enhance the really enthralling parts -- like reading a religious text, I thought, then read the line, ""Let's call this grey stuff light."" There is joy throughout the book, in Notleyish lines like ""Stars look like the word stars, / really do ... and sparkle is better as its word."" I love that -- an image that's purely linguistic. But this book also annoys me deeply. A few stanzas down from the stars line, which I annotated with giant asterisks, Notley writes: ""World is coming to an end means, Word is coming to an end."" This wordplay I find corny, too easy. There's a certain corniness to the whole sci-fi setup, One's journey in the glyph. ""Only poems can deal in the inexplicable,"" Notley claims, but I kept thinking of Hollywood movies: ""Arrival,"" ""The Matrix."" There's too much pre-existing scenery and special effects in our minds to imagine this world up from scratch.

""For the Ride"" is not exactly an optimistic book, since life as we know it in this futurescape is toast. But there is a strain of wishful thinking in the idea that neologisms, revamped grammars, could effect better living. One's ""new langue"" erases difference by design -- or there can be no difference, because the language doesn't allow it. Our avatar is not a he or she; One, paradoxically, is semi-plural, representing every one. ""There's no class, race, gender"" in the postapocalypse; ""differences between the ones are gone now."" Is this utopian, or anti-identity? ""Is there some justice?"" the poem later asks. That's not an answerable question anymore: ""Translate that please."" Does global destruction offer some kind of radical freedom? ""Don't have to be what / one is pastly in life."" This makes me think of a cryptic tweet by the climate philosopher Timothy Morton: ""You think ecologically tuned life means being all efficient and pure. Wrong. It means you can have a disco in every room of your house.""

A lot of recent books fall into this microgenre: climate-aware, speculative poetry, mixing the fantastical with what you might call dystopian realism. Brenda Shaughnessy's ""The Octopus Museum"" is one example; Chris Nealon's ""The Shore"" is another. These books take place in hell on earth and are nostalgic for the present. There's a sameness to them. It's no one's fault; you don't know you're writing the zeitgeist when you're in it, and then it's too late -- like all those people in the '70s who named their daughters Jennifer. My best friend is a Jennifer, and I often think of her mother explaining how novel it sounded at the time, and how regal, a variation on ""Guinevere.""

Your Money,Battle Over a $9 Million Will Rests on Just One Clause,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/13/your-money/will-estate-planning-fight.html,"Jill Morris and Joan Anderson met decades ago in New York City and were romantically involved for close to 20 years. Ms. Morris, a psychologist, died in 2016 at age 84 after suffering for years from cancer. Twelve days later, Ms. Anderson, 76, died of a stroke. For Emlie Anderson, the loss of her mother and her mother's partner so close together was devastating. She had moved from Texas to New York to help her mother care for Ms. Morris, she said. But their deaths weren't the end of a tough time in her life. They turned out to be the beginning of an estate battle that has pitted Ms. Anderson against three nonprofit organizations that argue that Ms. Morris's estate, valued at about $9 million, should go to them, not her. The legal argument centers on the nature of language in Ms. Morris's will, specifically a sentence in one subsection that treats her common-law wife the same as a dozen friends receiving smaller bequests. But the estate battle has also raised the issue of whether a heterosexual couple, together for the same 20 years, would face the same type of inheritance issue.

What the two sides agree on is that Ms. Morris, who had a doctorate and worked as a psychoanalyst, was an intelligent and charitable woman. (She also seemed to have an eye for buying properties in the right place at the right time.) They also agree that she and Ms. Anderson, who worked in sales, had a long-term relationship. But that's where the agreements end. The nonprofit groups say that the will must be followed and that Ms. Morris did not marry on purpose -- which she could have done after 2011. The other side argues that the pair were common-law spouses and should be accorded the same rights as a heterosexual couple. The dispute rests on one article in Ms. Morris's most recent will, which was executed shortly before she died. The article distributes various pieces of personal property as well as real estate and money. One friend gets a single glass marble sitting in an end table. Others get five-figure checks. An artist gets three of her own paintings.

The same article of the will also gives Ms. Anderson far more valuable things: $100,000; a townhouse in the West Village worth more than $4 million; a beach house in Water Mill, N.Y., that is on the market for about $750,000; the contents of Ms. Morris's safe deposit box at a bank; a carousel horse; and several paintings. But the distribution of these bequests comes after a clause that says Ms. Morris makes these gifts to each individual ""provided that he or she survives me by 30 days."" Other articles make specific gifts to friends without this 30-day clause. And as in any will, there is a residual clause, which sweeps up whatever is left and, in this case, leaves it to three charities. The three charities -- the Natural Resources Defense Council, Doctors Without Borders and Save the Children Federation -- with the State of New York joining them, contend that since the elder Ms. Anderson did not live 30 days after Ms. Morris died, she did not fulfill the requirement of the bequest and so what was meant for her goes to the charities. Ms. Anderson's daughter and her lawyers contend that this is a misreading of the will's intent. The lawyers note that by law you cannot disinherit a spouse. Depending on the state, a spouse is entitled to some percentage of the estate, at a minimum. That Ms. Morris and Ms. Anderson were together for so long would make them like spouses, if they were a heterosexual couple. Therefore, they argue, Joan Anderson should not be cut out of the will because she died just 12 days after Ms. Morris, and her daughter should inherit the money. The charities' lawyers said Ms. Morris had chosen not to marry and had also been specific with the drafting of the will and the naming of three charities she supported during her lifetime.

Sharon Klein, a trusts and estates lawyer who is the president of family wealth in the eastern United States for Wilmington Trust, said that some wording in the will was ambiguous but that she understood the court's ruling. ""It's just a poorly drafted will, with the 30-day survivorship clause in some places but not others,"" Ms. Klein said. ""You can make arguments on both sides. I'm sure the decedent wanted to benefit her life partner. The question is, did she want to benefit her life partner's daughter? That she didn't nominate Joan's daughter as a beneficiary is pretty telling."" Emlie Anderson has appealed the ruling, with briefs delivered this month. The appeal is based in part on how a surviving spouse would have been treated in a will as well as on how the will was revised. Wills are meant to be interpreted in their entirety, not clause by clause, Ms. Anderson's lawyers argue. A lawyer had created the original version. But Ms. Morris revised the will a few months before her death with the help of a friend, Charlie Martin. He had been the common-law husband of Ms. Anderson's other daughter, Kimberly, who died several years earlier. Mr. Martin has no legal training; before getting into webcasting, he was an engineer and a promoter for rock bands. Mr. Martin said in an interview that the couple had regularly gone to him for help on things like shoveling snow or winterizing the beach house. And they asked him to look at Ms. Morris's will because he had the software to open the file. He said he had sat with Ms. Morris as she revised the amounts she wanted to leave her friends.

""I made the changes in the file and went along my merry way,"" he said. ""Then the will was contested, and all of these people came out of the woodwork that we never saw. I don't think Joan had seen most of these people in many years, if not decades."" Mr. Scarola, the lawyer for the Anderson estate, said: ""One of the reasons the will is a mess is Charlie Martin, who isn't a lawyer but is quite computer savvy, sat with Jill some months before she passed away and took a version of her will to hear what she wanted to change."" The lawyers for the charities cited previous versions of the will to buttress their claims to the estate.

Ms. Bernstein declined to address her compensation as executor and defended her connection to Ms. Morris. ""I was a friend of the deceased, Jill Morris, for approximately 30 years,"" she wrote in an email. ""She entrusted me to execute her will. I take that responsibility seriously."" The lawyers for the charities pointed to their appellate briefs, agreeing with the judge's ruling. The younger Ms. Anderson said the case was about more than the will. It was about validating the longstanding relationship between her mother and Ms. Morris. ""I'm telling the story the way it was,"" she said. ""I feel like something should count for the relationship that they had. If they weren't gay, I don't think this would be happening."" The appeal will be heard this winter.",Three charities say they're the heirs to a woman's estate.

Automobiles,"Timeless, but Not Frozen in Time",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/automobiles/collectibles/timeless-but-not-frozen-in-time.html,"Admirers of the Porsche 911 would insist that no other model in the auto industry has stayed so true to its original formula, a production life span that is closing in on 50 years. Yes, the Chevrolet Corvette celebrates its 60th anniversary this year, but the muscle-bound 2013 version is hardly cut from the same cloth as Harley Earl's tepid roadster of 1953. The 911, on the other hand, still carries the distinctive profile of the model that made its debut at the 1963 Frankfurt motor show. Its engine is still an opposed 6-cylinder, and it is still placed at the rear. One thing that's not the same is the model name: initially, the new Porsche was labeled the 901, but the road car was renamed the 911 because a French automaker, Peugeot, held the rights to three-digit model names with a zero in the middle. At the time, Porsche's visionary designers could hardly have imagined that their sports car would still be thriving and evolving a half-century later. Although the 911 has added weight and girth over the years, it has also been transformed, continuing as a benchmark for all-around performance.

Porsche did not start out as an automaker, but as an engineering firm doing design work for other companies. It began making its own sports car, the 356 model, in the late 1940s, amid the rubble of postwar Germany. Based heavily on the design of the humble Volkswagen Beetle, the Porsche 356 established the company as a producer of well-engineered, high-quality cars, its reputation bolstered by racing successes. Ferdinand Porsche, the genius who founded the company, died in 1951, but his son, known as Ferry, was firmly at the helm. As competition increased, Ferry and his talented staff felt the need for a new-generation car to replace the aging but still-popular 356, so in the mid-1950s they set out to develop a slimmer shape with a stronger engine. Some of their early efforts involved dusting off partly developed plans from earlier years. An awkward notchback prototype was considered, but Ferry's son, F. A., known as Butzi, responded with a sleeker, more contemporary version of the Porsche coupe sketched by the company's original stylist, Erwin Komenda, in the 1940s. The family business also included Ferry Porsche's nephew, Ferdinand K. Piech, a promising young engineer who conceived the seven-bearing crankshaft and overhead-cam layout that endowed the 6-cylinder 911 engine with its rapid-revving sports-car personality. The 911 also benefited from a racing-derived lubricating system that prevented engine damage. With improvements in tires, brakes and suspension systems, cars were now able to corner and stop so hard that the engine would starve for lubrication as oil sloshed away from the supply tube of the circulating pump. To prevent this, the 911 engine was given two oil pumps, one to keep a reservoir tank full of oil and a second pump to feed oil from the tank to the moving parts, regardless of cornering, acceleration or braking forces. This so-called dry-sump system also eliminates the deep oil pan that normally hangs below the engine, making it possible to lower the mounting point and improve handling.

The Porsche 911 was not perfect, although many considered it bulletproof. Early on, the tensioners for its cam chains were prone to failure, often with near-catastrophic results. And the car had a disconcerting habit of oversteering, especially when a novice driver would suddenly let off the gas pedal in the middle of an exuberant turn. While expert drivers used this quirk effectively, steering through curves with the throttle, less experienced pilots spun out in short order. In recent years, modifications by Porsche engineers, including electronic stability control systems, have made the 911 more forgiving.

As the road-going 911 evolved, it became more powerful and luxurious, but also heavier. For this reason, many enthusiasts feel that some of the earlier models -- 1969-73 cars in particular -- are the most fun to drive and more desirable to collect. ""The 911 Porsches built after 1973 became heavier,"" said Dennis Frick, owner of Europa Macchina, a Porsche restoration business in Lewisberry, Pa., ""and the pre-1969 cars simply aren't as good."" At the same time, Mr. Frick points out, some later 911s are desirable for their luxury features, overall reliability and easy-to-drive engine and transmission. This is especially true of the 1987-89 cars. Some 911 models desirable to collectors command stratospheric prices. For example, the limited-production RS, a rare high-performance 911 offered in the early 1970s, is a six-figure car in decent shape, while other 911 models of that era usually fall into the $30,000 to $70,000 range.

One of the most sophisticated, high-tech versions of the 911 was never officially sold in the United States. With its twin-turbo engine and slippery shape, the 959 was the fastest street-legal production car in the world when it was introduced in the mid-1980s, and its impressive all-wheel-drive system was later used on the Carrera 4 and Turbo models. Many enthusiasts favor the 993, the factory's designation for the last 911 generation with an air-cooled engine. It's not uncommon to see a good 993 sell for more than the later water-cooled 996 models. Whether first-timers or experienced collectors, 911 buyers' most common mistake is to be swept away by the allure of a good-looking car, buying it without first having an expert put it up on a lift and look carefully at the underside. Beginning with 1976 production, Porsche used zinc-coated steel for the entire 911 body shell. This galvanized coating greatly reduces the chance of rust. For a time in the 1970s, well-intentioned Porsche managers laid sound plans to replace the 911, a rear-engine outlier, with a new generation of traditional front-engine sports cars, beginning with the 4-cylinder 924 and the more luxurious V-8-powered 928. But the outspoken loyalty of its 911 customers surprised even the Porsche managers. Sales of the 911 remained strong, while these front-engine models got a lukewarm response and were eventually discontinued. Although the price of admission isn't cheap, 911 owners are surprisingly diverse, albeit largely male. When Rod Heckman worked in the corporate world and got a $25,000 signing bonus, he asked himself, ""What would be the most fun of any gift I could buy myself?"" He fell in love with a 911 convertible, which he has owned for the last 20 years. Harriet Sparkler first bought a less expensive Porsche Boxster, later replacing it with a 911. ""In my mind, the Porsche brand is considered the best,"" she said. ""When I test-drove the 911, it had such a wonderful feel. Among other things, the clutch seemed so much nicer than my Boxster."" Sometimes described as ""a car everybody wants and nobody needs,"" there's no question that 911 sales are vulnerable to the ups and downs of the global economy, and yet it has survived deep recessions that killed many other sports cars. As a textbook example of industrial design that has progressed to keep pace with design trends, with each new model reinterpreting its heritage yet resisting retrograde shifts, the classic, beloved shape of the 911 has endured. It remains Porsche's core model line, if not in sheer numbers, certainly in desirability.","The Porsche 911 may be turning 50, but it still carries its distinctive profile, and the engine remains an opposed 6-cylinder placed at the rear.",4af69c12-7933-53ee-9b61-795b3d9d7ab9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/26/automobiles/Porsche3/Porsche3-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=316&w=600&s=3e15c096febe5653ac6d57553d16fc3d6129a05c6d5a10d92ca93fc243a7d3a2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,TRUE TO FORM The classic lines of a 1965 Porsche 911.,4af69c12-7933-53ee-9b61-795b3d9d7ab9,N24News/imgs/4af69c12-7933-53ee-9b61-795b3d9d7ab9.jpg,23
Media,Pepsi's Super Bowl Ad Blitz Aims for a Big Payoff,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/business/pepsis-super-bowl-ad-blitz-aims-for-a-big-payoff.html,"A giant crop circle appeared in fields around Phoenix this week, the first in a series of strange desert sightings expected in Arizona in the days leading up to Sunday's Super Bowl. The extraterrestrial-like cultivation is not a signal from aliens who have taken a sudden interest in football. The stunts are the work of Pepsi, which is trying to make a giant splash with a multifaceted, monthslong Super Bowl campaign that culminates on Sunday with a 30-second game-day spot and its sponsorship of Katy Perry's halftime show.

""If you want to be part of pop culture, then you have to be part of the biggest event in the country,"" said Simon Lowden, Pepsi's chief marketing officer for North American beverages. ""If you want to be part of the conversation, you have to be there in as big a way as possible.""

The strategy illustrates the extremes that marketers are going to in an attempt to get the biggest payoff from the $4.5 million they spend for 30 seconds of commercial time during the big game.

* Playoff Simulator: Explore every team's path to the postseason, updated live. The spotlight used to be solely on those ads. But the web has transformed the marketing game plan: Advertisers now increasingly extend the process, trying to build viewership for the commercials in stages, by posting the spots and teasers for them online before the game, as well as creating social media campaigns around them. Over the years, Super Bowl marketing has evolved into a year-round exercise, especially for the biggest spenders, like Anheuser-Busch and PepsiCo, which owns Pepsi and Doritos, which also advertises during the game. PepsiCo ranks among the top three Super Bowl advertisers based on spending from 2010 to 2014, paying $76.6 million on network advertising alone in the last five years, according to WPP's Kantar Media. ""It used to be that the whole thing lived and died based on what happened on game day on the TV in the living room,"" said Allen Adamson, chairman of the North American region of Landor Associates, a brand consulting firm. ""Now, it is, How do you manage up to the top of the mountain and how do you manage it down?"" NBC, which is televising the game, said on Wednesday that it had sold out advertising time for the broadcast. Spots started at a record $4.5 million for 30 seconds of commercial time. The broadcaster said that it had sold slightly more than 70 total commercial units, with 15 first-time Super Bowl advertisers buying spots.

Pepsi, which is sponsoring the Super Bowl halftime show for the third time in a row this year, starts planning its marketing blitz soon after the clock runs out on the previous year's game. The idea this year was to try to bring the excitement surrounding the show to different places across the country, staging events to create material for commercials as well as for people to share their experiences on social media. The brand's efforts included more than 40 promotional activities, starting on Thanksgiving Day with a spot that featured a Pepsi-sponsored concert for military veterans featuring the country music star Blake Shelton. Other promotions included a partnership with Comedy Central for a web series with Craig Robinson and his band The Nasty Delicious, as well as a concert in Rochester this month featuring the Norwegian musicians Nico and Vinz. The concert was the result of a ""Hype Your Hometown"" contest in which people could win tickets to go on the field for the halftime show, or for a concert in their hometown. This week, the brand is staging various ""strange occurrences"" in attempts to build anticipation for the commercial that leads directly into Ms. Perry's performance. It is drawing inspiration from the desert lore of mysterious sightings, in the same way that Pepsi found inspiration last year in the Super Bowl's host city with a spot that transformed the New York City skyline into various musical instruments. The crop circle, 360 feet in diameter and decorated as a Pepsi logo, appears in a field in Glendale, Ariz., about half a mile away from the University of Phoenix Stadium, where the game will be played. People who fly into the Phoenix airport will be able to see the circle. The circle is the first of several stunts Pepsi has planned. It is also releasing a teaser spot that shows a Pepsi vending machine and delivery truck beaming into the sky. The hope is that those efforts, along with the halftime show -- which in recent years has drawn more viewers than the actual game -- will help the marketer stand out from the pack of advertisers and build anticipation for its campaign. ""We just want to create an out-of-this-world experience,"" said Mr. Lowden, of Pepsi.",The food and beverage giant has expanded its marketing efforts beyond game day to include events across the country.,1a010d52-3e34-525f-abd9-9e1ec06d1761,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/29/business/28PEPSI/28PEPSI-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=5cf683ddde7a9cdd3e59022b1f733ce22d3f90e15e6cd7706765b2eb5ebb7954&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A crop circle near the game stadium in Phoenix, part of Pepsi's advance work, shows its logo.",1a010d52-3e34-525f-abd9-9e1ec06d1761,N24News/imgs/1a010d52-3e34-525f-abd9-9e1ec06d1761.jpg,16
Sports,"In Stephen Curry's Return, the Raptors Reign Again",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/sports/basketball/stephen-curry-warriors-raptors.html,"It was Stephen Curry vs. Kyle Lowry again Thursday night, as the Golden State Warriors faced off against the Toronto Raptors in their first matchup since last year's N.B.A. finals. The game went back and forth, and just like in the series-clinching Game 6 of the finals at Oracle Arena, the Raptors prevailed in the final minutes. Nine months after losing in the finals, the Warriors have the worst record in the league. Curry made his return on Thursday against the Raptors after missing 58 games with a broken left hand, and just in time to become the answer to a trivia question: He was the only Warriors player in the lineup who appeared in the 2019 N.B.A. finals against Toronto. Kevin Durant is in Brooklyn. Klay Thompson is out for the season with a knee injury. Draymond Green and Kevon Looney both sat with injuries. Championship mainstays like Shaun Livingston (retired) and Andre Iguodala (Miami Heat) have moved on. The Warriors now play at the Chase Center, a new arena in downtown San Francisco. In a season that has been humbling for everyone involved, Coach Steve Kerr was excited to see his franchise player return.

""I think there will be a sense of energy and enthusiasm the rest of the season,"" Kerr said before the game. ""To me, this is sort of the beginning of next season in a lot of ways."" Curry scored 23 points in 27 minutes on 6-of-16 shooting, and while he was only 3 of 12 from beyond the arc in the loss, a 4-point play in the third quarter reminded everyone why he is still the single most exciting player in the league to watch. No lead ever feels safe when Curry is on the floor. ""It felt great. There was a lot of energy,"" he said. ""The anticipation for getting back out there tonight, just getting out on the floor and seeing what was going to happen. It's kind of a cool moment just with the excitement and energy in the building.""

It was playoff energy for a team that is, at least not this year, playoff-bound. The box score illustrated what a strange transitional season it has been for the Warriors. Aside from Curry, four other Warriors scored in double figures: Damion Lee, who has 94 games of N.B.A. experience; Andrew Wiggins, recently acquired from the Minnesota Timberwolves for D'Angelo Russell; Eric Paschall, the 41st pick in the 2019 draft; and Marquese Chriss, a former lottery pick who was waived in January and re-signed to a two-year contract a month later.

If Golden State's downturn this season comes as a surprise, Toronto's impressive regular season has been just as eye-opening. Just weeks after bringing the Larry O'Brien trophy north of the border for the first time, the Raptors watched Kawhi Leonard, the most valuable player of the finals, join the Los Angeles Clippers in free agency, and lost Danny Green, their two-way stalwart guard, to the Los Angeles Lakers. While the rest of the championship core remained, many expected Toronto to take a step back this season. Some prognosticators even picked the Raptors to miss the playoffs entirely. Those predictions seem realistic when you consider the rash of injuries that has hit the Raptors' roster throughout the season. All of their top eight players have missed games. Some of those absences have been long-term. Their man games lost to injury total has rivaled the Warriors'.

Under these circumstances, it would have been easy to understand if the Raptors had their own disappointing season. Instead, they have mostly replicated last year's regular-season success, and they put together a franchise-record 15-game winning streak before the All-Star break in February. Thursday's 121-113 win improved their record to 44-18, giving them a slight lead over the Boston Celtics for the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference. The victory also clinched a seventh-consecutive playoff berth for the Raptors. It's the earliest they've clinched a postseason spot in franchise history. Nick Nurse, a front-runner for the Coach of the Year Award, has made every lineup combination work, juggling injuries that have required a nightly collective effort by Toronto to overcome these setbacks.

Norman Powell scored a career-high 37 points. Lowry added 26 points and 10 assists, the same totals he tallied in Game 6 of the N.B.A. finals last year. Serge Ibaka was a dominating presence on the glass with 13 rebounds. The undrafted rookie Terence Davis had 10 points in 17 minutes, including two posterizing dunks in the second quarter. If the Warriors are already looking ahead to next season, the Raptors are preparing for another deep playoff run. And while Kerr is hoping that Curry's energy will power the team down the stretch, Nurse wants to continue to groom and prepare Pascal Siakam, a first-time All-Star, to be the team's go-to option in the playoffs. Against the Warriors, Siakam struggled through a 5-for-17 shooting night but came up with huge offensive plays in the closing minutes of the fourth quarter to put the game away. ""We are trying to get him a lot of looks and a lot of reps,"" Nurse said after the game. ""Even though it might not be super high percentage stuff, I want him to get a feel for what's happening all over the floor."" While the Raptors are counting on Siakam to make a leap in the postseason, they have also taken a page from Golden State's famous slogan during their recent championship run: Strength in numbers. Without a dominant superstar in their lineup, the Raptors have pushed through with the same championship resolve that the Warriors showed in last year's finals, when they fought through season-ending injuries to Durant and Thompson and nearly forced a deciding seventh game in Toronto. The Raptors' defense ranks second over all in the league, and they have an impressive 21-9 record on the road. These are numbers that bode well for a team looking to prove it is still in the conversation as a championship contender come playoff time.","The Warriors guard came back for a changed team against a redrawn foe, but his brilliance, and Toronto's resilience, remained the same.",dfd8d496-5dce-5f55-87b5-4343593efdcf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/06/sports/06nba-warriorsraptors-lede/06nba-warriorsraptors-lede-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=6d3763d16665f8a067fed7f2dd3a1becc6f86ccc932c90f49523fe99b9cf344e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Warriors guard Stephen Curry scored 23 points in his return from a 58-game injury absence after breaking his left hand.,dfd8d496-5dce-5f55-87b5-4343593efdcf,N24News/imgs/dfd8d496-5dce-5f55-87b5-4343593efdcf.jpg,9
Theater,"Review: Sweet Bear, Sticky Situation in 'Paddington Gets in a Jam'",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/22/theater/paddington-gets-in-a-jam-review.html,"Although Winnie-the-Pooh is arguably the most famous bear in children's fiction, Paddington ranks high in the pantheon.

Invented by the British author Michael Bond, Paddington appears far more gentlemanly and literate than Pooh, and he certainly has a superior wardrobe. (Unlike Pooh's too-small shirt, Paddington's signature duffle coat covers his bottom.) But the two share important traits: They both love sweets, and in navigating the wider world, they're fundamentally clueless.

That characteristic underlies ""Paddington Gets in a Jam,"" the charming, cheerful family show that just opened Off Broadway at the DR2 Theater. Created and nimbly directed by Jonathan Rockefeller, it demonstrates how much can go wrong when you send a well-intentioned bear to do a person's tasks.

Rockefeller, who also developed the mesmerizing and lovely puppet production ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar Show,"" based on the books of Eric Carle -- a version of it, ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar Show Experience,"" runs through Dec. 29 at the South Street Seaport -- uses puppetry here, too. But the Paddington character, designed by Rockefeller Productions, is the only mechanical player onstage, and the puppeteers Jake Bazel, John Cody and Kirsty Moon maneuver it without ever showing themselves, which is no small feat.",Despite a meanspirited neighbor — spoiler alert! — things work out just fine.,0771a160-5ab6-5a17-bc62-3c8ccbc6d3d3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/22/arts/22paddington2/merlin_166254897_a5737ef4-0bda-4d1e-902a-cbd6c07e4ac1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=b88992607dd8dad6d3eaefb9bb690b3ae372ba9a644cdd3e3187d1e80aa30d6f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Paddington Bear comes to life thanks to the puppeteers Jake Bazel, John Cody and Kirsty Moon, who remain hidden.",0771a160-5ab6-5a17-bc62-3c8ccbc6d3d3,N24News/imgs/0771a160-5ab6-5a17-bc62-3c8ccbc6d3d3.jpg,10
Automobiles,Driven | 2015 Acura TLX,https://www.nytimes.com/video/automobiles/100000003175474/2015-acura-tlx.html,"Glance at any TV, computer, tablet or phone screen- let's face it, it's impossible to escape them- and you've probably seen ads for Acura's new TSX with the tagline ""It's That Kind of Thrill"". The car itself appears at a party thrown by Ludacris (apparently he doesn't attend his own soirees) and careening through the midnight streets and parking structures of Gotham (clearly the helmeted driver knows the cops are on a donut break). Acura is of course Honda's premium mark. TLX replaces two sedans in its line up, TSX and TL. In spirit, it's the TL without the creased Transformer-like sheetmetal. The designers, seemingly wary of thrills, steered clear of controversy this time around. Only the signature Acura beak attempts to polarize. TLX can be had with a 206 horsepower four-cylinder. The car I'm driving in the video is Acura's 290 horse 3.5-liter V-6. All front-drive TLXs get all-wheel steering. The six-cylinder comes with a nine-speed dual-clutch automatic, four-cylinders get an eight-speed dual-clutch with a torque converter. Super Handling All-Wheel Drive can only be had with the V6. Honda knows how to bake sportiness into its chassis and TSX drives like a really nice Honda. This SH-AWD version zooms from 0-60 in just under six seconds. It has become quieter at highway velocities too. Word on the street is four-cylinder models have a crisper overall driving feel. Sending more torque to the outside rear tire during corning, it's hard to know how much Super Handling All-Wheel Drive affects performance since it can't been switched off. Perhaps due to the Lane Keeping Assist system, TLX has an on-center feel that is absolutely locked down. Stuff like standard Jewel Eye LED headlights and optional ELS audio system impress. To run with Audi, BMW, Cadillac, and the newly aggressive Lexus, Acura might try putting the passion of the ads into the car. The pleasure of a stylish cut and sewn dash, self-parking system or panoramic glass roof is not available on TLX. The interface will be very familiar to Honda owners. I would be thrilled if it were more elegant to use and had Audi or BMW grade graphics. At least iPhone owners can use Siri Eyes Free. Starting at $31,900 and loaded at $45,600, the reasonable price could withstand a slight jump to pay for those goodies. It's as if Acura product planners believe buyers don't need them. And perhaps we don't. But we want them, don't we? Promising thrills, Acura delivers understatement and logic. VIDEO SCRIPT It's hard to escape genetics. A car company can spin its image with millions of dollars of marketing but a vehicle's DNA speaks louder than any ad. I'm Tom Voelk with Driven for The New York Times. The TLX sport sedan has been launched with Acura's largest promotional campaign ever. The tag line? ""It's That Kind of Thrill"". That's a lot to live up to. (ON CAMERA) I have never been a fan of Acura's seemingly random alphabet soup nomenclature but the TLX actually makes sense since it effectively replaces two cars in their lineup, the TL and TSX. The only remnant of TLs angry robot design is the bionic beak. Acura drew this one up conservatively. Functionally, standard LED headlights are brilliant. Pun intended.

On-center feel is positively locked down. Good for long distances, it's much quieter than the outgoing TL. (ON CAMERA) Acura's fuel saving start stop system is different than most. Use a light pedal effort while stopped and the engine will not shut off. You'll get a prompt to push harder. There you go. It automatically restarts (SOUND UP) Wish the response was a hair quicker. TLX begins at $31,900. This one's loaded at $45,600 with impressive safety tech including lane keep assist. It reads road stripes to keep the car centered, even on this slightly curving stretch of road. Pretty cool. There's radar assist cruise control too. Acura takes a sensible approach to luxury. Materials are quite good, but emotional touches such as a cut and sewn dash and needle sweeping dramatics at startup are missing. Panoramic roof glass, self-parking feature, and a rear sunshade are not available. The interface, not always intuitive, is controlled by a knob or the lower haptic touch screen. It will look and feel familiar to Honda owners, upgraded graphics would be nice. Voice commands are tedious. (ON CAMERA) Space is okay here, two average sized adult shouldn't complain. I'll give you a second to look at knee room and foot room. The middle position? That's a different story. It's raised up so... put the small passenger here No power port or storage in the doors? Seats cushions don't get heat either. It comfortable but folks back here don't get the VIP treatment. (ON CAMERA) With the proximity key in your pocket there are cars that will pop the trunk automatically if you simply stand near it or wave your foot under the bumper. Yes, the cargo hold will handle long stuff so long as it isn't too wide. The average score in the T.P. Trunk Test for this class is six bundles. TLX matches that. There's a lot of Honda DNA here. More flair, emotion, and maybe rear-wheel drive are needed to set the Acura division apart. The nimble TLX is understated and logical. It's that kind of thrill. There is an awful lot of tech in TLX that is either difficult to shoot or too time consuming to explain. I'm sure your friendly Acura salesperson would be happy to school you. There's blind spot warning and collision mitigation. (ON CAMERA) ELS SU (SOUND UP) The lane keep assist can really be felt, but like all tech it's not one that you should rely on (SOUND UP) See what I mean? Finally, I would love to see some common sense applied to Acura's names. Let's start with X should be reserved for all-wheel drive. Or maybe they could just go back to Legend and Integra.

Theater,How Do You Make a Play About Water? Drop by Drop,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/theater/how-do-you-make-a-play-about-water-drop-by-drop.html,"The two actors were sopping wet, their clothes sticking to their skin. In a dinghy onstage at 3LD Art & Technology Center in Lower Manhattan, they were rehearsing a scene from Sheila Callaghan's immersive new eco-play, ""(Not) Water"" -- guzzling water ever more sloppily from a succession of increasingly large plastic containers, then throwing their empties overboard. They talked. They drank. The liquid spilled out and drenched them. The bottom of the boat sloshed with runoff. ""Act like you're not wet at all,"" their director, Daniella Topol, called from a few yards away on a recent afternoon, and the performers stopped wiping their eyes. Letting the water course over them, they just kept on going. It's a tricky element, water -- messy, difficult to contain and, for Ms. Callaghan and Ms. Topol, who conceived ""(Not) Water"" together, elusive as a dramatic subject. It has taken nearly a dozen years for the play, which began in 2005 with a monologue about Hurricane Katrina, to find its shape.

""It's about water quality, which we have control over, and water quantity, which we don't have control over,"" Ms. Callaghan said from Los Angeles, where she writes for the Showtime comedy ""Shameless,"" and where the yearslong drought informed her thinking about water. Yet it is such an enormous topic that it was not only hard to grasp but also exhausting to confront. The hyperawareness of details concerning any number of issues (climate change, safe drinking water, use of natural resources) periodically led to what she called ""urgency fatigue.""

""We're trying to hold a storm in our hands,"" a character named Not Sheila says in the play -- or did in a recent draft, which has been updated since. Because that's the thing about this show: Its state of flux has been a constant. Hurricane Sandy, the lead-tainted water in Flint, Mich., even President Trump's announcement this month that the United States would pull out of the Paris climate accord -- with each significant event, the play has morphed anew. Waist-deep in ""(Not) Water,"" Ms. Callaghan, 44, and Ms. Topol, 42, just keep on fording. Presented by the theater company New Georges at 3LD, where it opens on Thursday, June 15, the full-length play is part of a program called Works on Water that includes an exhibition of visual art. It joins a growing body of plays addressing climate change and the chaos it's wreaking (Cynthia Hopkins's ""This Clement World,"" Sharyn Rothstein's ""By the Water,"" Madeleine George's ""Hurricane Diane,"" the Civilians' ""The Great Immensity""). Ms. Callaghan said her show -- a multimedia experience in which video has a prominent role -- is intended not as a polemic but as a catalyst for conversation, even if ""there's a little ornery activist heart at the core of the play."" Part provocation, part meditation, it embraces silliness, ventures into scariness and from the start demands a measure of participation from audience members. On arrival, they choose their own seats from a heap of buckets, plastic crates, camp chairs and coolers.

The set designer, Deb O, described it as the kind of unruly pile you see in post-flood news photos, where people's belongings have been removed from their homes and tossed onto their lawns. ""You just pull up that 5-gallon bucket and you sit on that and look at what has happened,"" she said. Ms. Callaghan's problem, when Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in 2005, was that she couldn't stop looking. The storm didn't affect her directly; she was living in New York then, and she watched television footage of the disaster's victims from the comfort of her gym. Outraged, she became obsessed with both the government's failure to protect vulnerable people and the power of something as essential and everyday as water to ""turn on us,"" she said. The piece that became ""(Not) Water"" has gone through many work-in-progress incarnations in the years since. One staging, at Here, was so early in the artists' ecological awareness that each audience member was given a bottle of water -- a gesture the team later discarded as wasteful, Ms. Topol said. Another version, at the 14th Street Y, featured a doughnut-shaped stage by Mimi Lien, the Tony-nominated set designer of ""Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812,"" with the audience on the inside looking out. Ms. Callaghan and Ms. Topol had a welcome success when they collaborated on the ambitious, multimedia ""Dead City"" in 2006, also with New Georges at 3LD. (Two actors from that show, April Matthis and Rebecca Hart, are also in this one.) ""It was, both of us, our first big deal,"" said Ms. Topol, who is now the artistic director of Rattlestick Playwrights Theater. But they couldn't get ""(Not) Water"" to breathe the way they wanted.

Then, in November, at a reading the day before the presidential election, Ms. Callaghan presented the company with a fresh draft structured around a couple of new characters named Not Sheila and DT: stage versions of Ms. Callaghan and Ms. Topol. The characters have the same humor and rapport as their real-life counterparts, and they get similarly overwhelmed as they wrestle with the same storytelling problems. As a frame, it's self-aware, meta and riskily so. ""Daniella was horrified because first of all, I don't remember asking her permission to put her in the play,"" Ms. Callaghan said. ""She wasn't entirely comfortable with it. Because it is so revealing. It reveals on some level that we were lost."" Yet that way of approaching the play, allowing those characters to observe and respond to the world around them, seemed at last to be the key. ""It was the first time it ever started to feel alive,"" Ms. Callaghan said.

More recently, she borrowed a potent Hurricane Sandy memory from Susan Bernfield, the producing artistic director of New Georges, whose ailing mother was using an oxygen tank and had to be evacuated from her apartment by firefighters after the storm knocked the power out. A character named Susanbernfield Artisticdirector tells that story. Deb O also has a mom story, and she told it when Ms. Callaghan and Ms. Topol called to feel her out about joining the project. ""There was a barrage of questions,"" Deb O recalled. ""My relationship with water, and have I thought about water, and what have I done with water."" She mentioned the parasite in the water supply in her native Milwaukee that killed scores of people and sickened 400,000 others, including her mother, in 1993. Plastic water bottles are objects of ecological loathing for Deb O, and a sprawling sculpture that is part of her ""(Not) Water"" set uses about 2,000 of them, scavenged from various sources and destined for recycling.

Movies,'Spree' Review: Desperately Seeking Likes,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/movies/spree-review.html,"Hideous to look at and agonizing to listen to, ""Spree"" must hold the record for the greatest number of annoying characters in a single movie. Coarsely merging social-media critique and slasher comedy, this shallow take on the evils of internet addiction is as unoriginal as it is unfunny.

Joe Keery plays Kurt Kunkle, a floppy-haired psychopath frustrated that his Instagram followers have numbered in the single digits for more than a decade. A crude sketch of his life thus far includes his excitable father (David Arquette) -- a D.J. pursuing his own Xanadu of screen views -- and a frenemy (Josh Ovalle) whose online fame far exceeds Kurt's. Tired of beseeching other influencers to tag him in their feeds, Kurt, a driver for a ride-share service called Spree, hits on a plan: If he murders his more repugnant passengers -- a white supremacist here, a mouth-breathing chauvinist there -- and live-streams their fates, then his online celebrity will surely explode.

Directed by Eugene Kotlyarenko, ""Spree"" is an aesthetic nightmare of screens-within-screens, splitting and reshaping and crawling with real-time commentary on Kurt's bloody deeds. This infection of our movie visuals with hectic impersonations of online behavior has been spreading for a while now, and ""Spree"" reaches some kind of nadir. Moreover, the film's lack of perceptiveness -- ""I May Destroy You"" on HBO currently offers far greater insight into the dark seductions of influencer culture -- is disappointing. Kotlyarenko seems entirely unaware that his escalation of gore suggests he's just as thirsty to be seen as his sick protagonist.

Real Estate,"A Tough Sell, in Concrete and Glass",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/realestate/in-the-region-connecticut-a-tough-sell-in-concrete-and-glass.html,"Sited on one of the highest points in Ridgefield, a concrete-and-glass house by Rafael Vinoly has been for sale for several years.

MICHELLE GENOVESI has fiddled with her fair share of home alarm systems in 25-plus years of showing houses. But within minutes of opening up the glass doors of her listing here on Ridgebury Road, two police cruisers pulled up in the cobblestone courtyard. She had inadvertently set off the silent alarm. But this was one call the officers didn't mind making. They were eager to take a look around the house, which is, to put it mildly, a bit of a curiosity in tradition-bound Ridgefield. More museum than living space, the residence at 191 Ridgebury is made of concrete, glass and steel. It is wired with commercial-grade security systems, which employ outside cameras, temperature and motion sensors, and alarms to announce approaching vehicles. Atop a high hill overlooking a small valley, it has commanding views of the open fields and scenic woods of the horse country of Ridgefield and North Salem, N.Y. Work on the house began in 1990; costs reached about $20 million by the time it was finished in 1993, Ms. Genovesi said. But in a 300-year-old town known for historical correctness, being something of an architectural crossbreed hasn't helped the house sell. First listed in 2008 for $10 million, it is offered today for $3.2 million.

The late owner's estate decided to donate the hilltop property in December 2010. The recipient, Fairfield University, a private institution in Fairfield, has been trying to sell it ever since. ""It's not your typical mom-dad-and-three-kids Ridgefield home,"" said David Frassinelli, the university's associate vice president for facilities. ""It begs an international market, art collectors."" The donor, Alice Lawrence, had an extensive art collection. She was the widow of Sylvan Lawrence, a Manhattan real estate developer whose company owned an estimated $1 billion worth of New York property at the time of his death in 1981. Ms. Lawrence's collection of 19th- and 20th-century art was sold at auction by Christie's, for more than $22 million, after her death in 2008. She had hired Rafael Vinoly to design the Ridgefield house, as well as a house in East Hampton also known for its bold use of concrete. (That house was sold before she died.) A leader in an architectural team that came close to winning the World Trade Center site design competition, Mr. Vinoly is known more for his institutional designs -- for performing arts centers, museums and educational buildings around the world. A lawyer for the Lawrence family, Robert L. Berchem, said his clients had no comment on their decision to donate the Ridgefield property, or why they had chosen Fairfield University. One of Ms. Lawrence's children, Marta Jo, does have a residence in Fairfield.

According to Mr. Frassinelli, the university accepted the gift with the understanding that it would very likely be sold off. The university campus is about 45 minutes away, and in any case the house's design does not easily translate to institutional uses. Or, perhaps, even to residential uses. For one thing, although the living area approaches 10,000 square feet, the house has only two bedrooms: a master bedroom in a three-story tower, and a guest room at the opposite end of the house.

Then there is the cantilevered steel staircase in the master bedroom tower. The absence of railings creates the pleasing illusion of floating steps, but for a university's purposes, the open-air effect is a potential safety hazard. ""For uses and occupancies greater than 50 people,"" Mr. Frassinelli pointed out, ""it triggers a whole bunch of code upgrades that would significantly modify and impair the beauty of the house."" The town assessor's office has appraised the five-acre property at $5.4 million. A current appraisal would probably come in lower, as the last one was conducted in 2007, and values in Ridgefield have come down 20 to 40 percent since then, according to Al Garzi, the assessor. In marketing the property, Ms. Genovesi said, she is focusing on the house rather than the location.

""It's definitely for someone who appreciates the house as an art form, as opposed to for its total functionality,"" she said. ""It won't be bought by someone who just wants to live in Ridgefield."" A long concrete wall that runs through the heart of the home, dividing the guest wing from the main living area, is a central element of the design. The slab follows the 33 steps to the main entrance, then flanks the 58-foot indoor pool that claims the middle of the house, then continues alongside a 60-foot pool outside. To the left of the entry is the massive great room. Its inside wall is concrete, its outside wall glass. The floors are white travertine. The bowed ceiling is teak. The overall effect is austere -- appropriate for displaying art, perhaps, but not especially welcoming for living purposes, particularly in the wintertime, Ms. Genovesi said. She commissioned the interior design firm of Meredith Baer & Associates to warm up the rooms with plump leather armchairs and clean white sofas. A glass walkway leads to the tower, where the master bedroom is on the main floor. Above it is an office with built-in metal shelving, leather-covered cabinets and a fireplace. On the top is an observation deck offering 360-degree views. The house is as well protected from the elements as it is from intruders. The steep driveway is heated. The deck on top of the tower has a snow-melt system. And should a storm knock out electrical service, two generators in the lower level will take over. Taxes are $78,000, which the university must cover, along with upkeep and utilities, but Mr. Frassinelli said it will profit in the end. ""It's not an albatross,"" he said. ""We were very happy to receive the gift.""","A concrete-and-glass house by Rafael Viñoly in Ridgefield, now priced at $3.2 million, is proving to be a hard sell.",209fb73f-222e-5124-b7e3-fb506cd6861e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/01/22/realestate/22WCZO1/22WCZO1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=330&w=600&s=0490ced52b6e43edf6751749c6aa9b94977db7ab34a9629e44279feb4fc36f2a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Sited on one of the highest points in Ridgefield, a concrete-and-glass house by Rafael Viñoly has been for sale for several years.",209fb73f-222e-5124-b7e3-fb506cd6861e,N24News/imgs/209fb73f-222e-5124-b7e3-fb506cd6861e.jpg,7
Opinion,We Can Safely Restart the Economy in June. Here's How.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/opinion/coronavirus-economy.html,"The national quarantine would give hospitals time to stock up on supplies and equipment, find more beds and room to treat people, get better organized and give clinical staff a respite to recuperate for the next onslaught of Covid-19 care. Without these measures, any Covid-19 resurgence would be far harsher, and economically damaging.

Begin a mass education program. While many Americans have been more careful about washing their hands, keeping six feet away from other people, and staying indoors as much as possible, these new behaviors have not been adopted in every part of the country. We need a stronger campaign to educate Americans about these habits so that the average number of people any infected person might spread the virus to would drop below one, from about 2.4 today.

Create a Covid-19 certification system. States should use blood tests to certify people who have had Covid-19, are immune and are no longer contagious. These people could then work in hospitals or other areas where being risk-free would be a benefit.

Slowly open the economy and social activities. If these steps are taken, we should slowly open up parts of the economy in June, while requiring those 70 and older, or others at high risk, to continue to shelter in place, perhaps in isolation. Lifting restrictions could start with children and young adults, who are far less likely to get seriously ill and die. We might open up summer school, on a voluntary basis, and camps. Parents should be allowed to assess the risk that their children could become infected with the coronavirus and bring it home. Teachers and administrators would also have to be able to opt in, knowing they could acquire Covid-19. Colleges and universities might open up for summer sessions, with faculty and staff opting in, or not, with knowledge of the risks they are taking. Following South Korea and Taiwan, America should deploy testing and contact tracing aggressively during this opening to limit any potential outbreak.

Open the economy more fully. If the initial opening works, we should allow people in offices to go back to work in places where Covid-19 infections have died down. Businesses need to require workers to follow rules on physical distancing with fellow workers and customers, and to tell employees to isolate themselves if they believe they are infected. To permit physical distancing, we'd need occupancy of restaurants, bars and stores to be at half the legal limit.

We would then open museums and other venues to small numbers of people, although it would be necessary to still prohibit mass gatherings where physical distancing is not possible -- sporting events, large conferences, Fourth of July celebrations and tourist sites like Disney World. When possible, stores and restaurants could be managed and staffed by people certified to have had Covid-19 and be unable to spread it. If there are no flare-ups, more venues could be opened. During this gradual opening, public health teams would continue to perform contact tracing and enforce isolation. Meanwhile, scientists will continue furious efforts to create a vaccine that prevents infection, or medicines that treat the disease.

This is not a perfect solution. It is a middle course that can save lives and save the economy. Indeed, a recent analysis of the 1918 influenza pandemic concluded that cities that put in place public health measures like physical distancing tended to have both low mortality and high economic growth. Undoubtedly, some people will still become infected and die, but far fewer than if we arbitrarily set Easter as a date to open the economy without any concern that hundreds of thousands of people could die as a result.","Get tough now.

Food,"In Texas, Winemakers Find Room to Roam",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/dining/texas-wine-southold.html,"FREDERICKSBURG, Tex. -- From a porch swing at the Southold Farm & Cellar tasting room outside this small city in Texas Hill Country, a vista of scrubby ranchland stretches to the horizon. A house on a hill looms invitingly nearby, constructed by the Southold proprietors, Regan and Carey Meador, after they moved here in 2017 with their children, Coralai and Sawyer. Down below is their winery, a functional structure possessing little in the way of charm, though the cats seem to like it fine. Along a steep, east-facing limestone hillside is a new 16-acre vineyard, planted with rootstock onto which grape vines will be grafted in the near future. If all goes well, the Meadors will be harvesting white varieties rare to Texas like xarello and petite manseng and a mixture of reds, possibly including cinsault, alicante bouschet and touriga nacional.

The Meadors present a sharp contrast to the prevailing nature of Texas winemaking, where -- from the size of the vineyards to the style of the wines -- bigger has always been considered better. People in Texas may talk about a sense of place, but the experimental attitude and tools for expressing terroir have taken a back seat to imitating other regions. But the Meadors, by taking risks and exploring, may demonstrate a truer path for expressing Texas in a bottle. Southold seems a picture of contentment, a young family striving to make its mark in the new world of Texas wine. It will be difficult, groundbreaking work, with no clear model for success and no guarantee of achieving it.

Three years ago, the difficulties appeared profound. Their winery was on the North Fork of Long Island, in the town of Southold. It made some of the most exciting wines in the region, and was poised to become the sort of trailblazing innovator that drives interest in a wine area. In 2013, they planted a vineyard on the North Fork with similarly unusual grapes, like lagrein, teroldego and goldmuskateller, and applied for a zoning variance to build a small winery on their property. The Southold Zoning Board rejected their application and all appeals. Disillusioned, they decided to sell and start over in Texas, where Mr. Meador grew up, arriving in April 2017. Already, this second incarnation has ascended to a leading role in drawing attention to Texas wine. Just two vintages in, Southold is again making exciting wines, using an assortment of grapes purchased from both the High Plains, a flat, fertile, high-elevation area in the Lubbock area, the state's primary growing region, and Hill Country, which contains perhaps Texas's most promising growing areas.

Foregone Conclusion, a 2017 bottle made entirely from alicante bouschet from the Letkeman Family Vineyard in the Texas High Plains, is savory and rootsy, lively and earthy. To Mr. Meador, these wines more naturally reflect Texas than the prevailing style. ""How does big, heavy, oaky wine fit?"" he said. ""We eat barbecue and Mexican food, and they taste better with something fresh."" I don't see many alicante bouschets. The grape is often a part of old mixed vineyards, used for its ability to add a deep, dark color to red blends. But that's part of Mr. Meador's experimental nature, determining what works and what does not in this place, regardless of status or history.

""I'm willing to take risks, you've got to try things,"" Mr. Meador said as we drove in his big white pickup truck past fields of bluebonnets on our way to visit Robert Clay Vineyards in Mason, on the northwestern edge of Hill Country. ""There are really old vines out here with odd things, like graciano, dolcetto, petite sirah,"" he said. Texas' history of grapes and wine stretch back more than a century, but Prohibition ended a nascent industry. As grape-growing and winemaking have been reestablished over the last 40 years, simple, small-scale operations and the intricacies of place have rarely been part of the formula. Regardless of where it was grown, much wine from Texas producers is sold out of tasting rooms in Hill Country in central Texas. But only a small percentage of that wine is actually made in Texas from Texas grapes.

State law permits wineries, if they make a little Texas wine, to import a lot of wine from other places -- California, Italy, Israel, for example -- and bottle it under their proprietary labels. Not all Texas wineries are like that. Fall Creek makes a range of decent bottles, as does Lewis Wines and Duchman. And some producers are very much on Southold's path. William Chris makes an enticing collection of graceful, floral wines and appealing petillant naturels. Adrienne Ballou, an assistant winemaker at Southold, also makes tiny amounts of wonderfully appealing wines, like a 2017 mourvedre from the High Plains, under the Lightsome label. Henry Crowson, a young producer who worked at William Chris, now operates Crowson Wines in Johnson City, making a portfolio of wines with no added sulfur dioxide, a stabilizer almost universally used in the wine industry. Some Crowson wines are lovely; some are less successful experiments. Most Texas grapes are grown in the High Plains, a farming epicenter where grapevines are often treated like another type of row crop, rather than in Hill Country, which, though it might have more potential for making interesting wines, was historically the province of ranchers. ""It's easier to tell farmers to plant grapes than ranchers,"" Mr. Meador said. ""The biggest conversation that needs to happen is, where does it make sense to plant grapes in Texas?""

An important lesson that Mr. Meador took from Ms. Heekin is to step back from conventional assumptions, like the belief that Texas is too hot to make certain kinds of fine wine, or that Texas must mimic other regions. ""I doubt that Texas is too hot, which is like saying Vermont is too cold,"" Mr. Meador said. ""It's too hot to make Vermont wine here, too hot to make Napa cab. People have written off grapes like chardonnay because they couldn't make the wines they were trying to emulate. We just have to be different.""

Texas has its own sets of problems, like rattlesnakes and scorpions in the vineyard. But Mr. Meador said only one issue keeps him up at night: finding enough skilled workers. The Texas model is to do everything mechanically, from pruning to picking, which is why the long rows in the High Plains are the norm. But Mr. Meador's meticulous farming methods, not unusual in other fine wine regions, require skilled hand pruning and hand harvesting. ""It's hard, but I think we'll get through it,"" he said. After initial indifference to Southold's arrival, Austin, Houston and the Hill Country have embraced the Meadors as Long Island never did, and Mr. Meador can now see a future clearly. ""I get to make all the mistakes,"" Mr. Meador said. ""My kids get to fix them, and the grandkids get the benefit.""","Forced to leave the North Fork of Long Island after a zoning dispute, Southold Farm and Cellar, a groundbreaking producer, has started anew in Hill Country.",203edd23-8be0-5208-9d34-79a3ccc9ecda,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/22/dining/16pour1/16pour1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=583a560a1549bee2fb1797020581354880db2bf922d818ff9f1ef4f49016071a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"In Texas Hill Country, experimental winemakers are forging a new path.",203edd23-8be0-5208-9d34-79a3ccc9ecda,N24News/imgs/203edd23-8be0-5208-9d34-79a3ccc9ecda.jpg,17
Health,"Purdue Pharma, Maker of OxyContin, Files for Bankruptcy",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/15/health/purdue-pharma-bankruptcy-opioids-settlement.html,"Purdue Pharma, maker of OxyContin, the drug widely seen as igniting the opioid crisis, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday night, a move at the center of the company's efforts to shield itself and its owners from more than 2,600 federal and state lawsuits. The terms of the filing, which include a proposed resolution of most of those cases, are expected to be fiercely contested by a group of states -- led by Massachusetts and New York -- that have refused to settle with Purdue and are intent on pursuing the company's owners, the Sacklers, considered one of the wealthiest families in the United States. A showdown in bankruptcy court in White Plains could come as early as this week. Restructuring the company through bankruptcy was at the heart of a tentative settlement agreement reached last week between the company and thousands of cities and counties that have sued it in federal court for its role in the opioid epidemic. Twenty-four states and five United States territories have also accepted the agreement. Purdue's board of directors voted Sunday evening to approve the settlement in principle.

""This unique framework for a comprehensive resolution will dedicate all of the assets and resources of Purdue for the benefit of the American public,"" Steve Miller, chairman of Purdue's board of directors, said in a statement. ""This settlement framework avoids wasting hundreds of millions of dollars and years on protracted litigation, and instead will provide billions of dollars and critical resources to communities across the country trying to cope with the opioid crisis. "" Purdue hopes to restructure completely, with an expectation that the Chapter 11 bankruptcy will prompt an automatic stay of current civil litigation against the company over the opioid epidemic. The details of the settlement proposal have been reported in recent weeks: the Sacklers would give up ownership of the company and pay $3 billion cash to the plaintiffs over seven years. They would also have to sell their Britain-based drug company, Mundipharma. The proceeds from that sale could add ""substantial further monetary contributions"" to the settlement pot, according to a company statement released Sunday night. Purdue would be restructured into an entity known as a public benefit trust. Profits from its production of OxyContin and other drugs would pay the plaintiffs' claims, and also support research and development of medicines to treat addiction and overdoses, which would be donated to the public. The new company would abide by restrictions on the marketing and sales of opioids. The worth of the settlement has been a subject of contention. In its statement announcing the filing, Purdue said it assessed the value at $10 billion. But the states that have opposed the deal have disparaged those numbers, saying they are highly speculative and based on optimistic calculations that may take years to realize.

The opposing states also object to the deal because its structure allows the Sacklers, through Mundipharma, to participate in the drug manufacturing business until it is sold. These states note that the resolution of the lawsuits will be paid in part from ongoing sales of OxyContin in the United States and abroad -- rather than all of it from the Sacklers themselves. The states that have not signed on to the settlement deal, including Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, California, Illinois, Virginia, Delaware, North Carolina and others, as well as the District of Columbia, are almost uniformly those that have sued the Sacklers in addition to Purdue, or are about to. What remains unclear is whether the individual Sacklers who have been sued will benefit from the automatic stay of litigation that will most likely be accorded to their company. In a statement, the Sackler family expressed ""deep compassion for the victims of the opioid crisis,"" concluding: ""We are hopeful that in time, those parties who are not yet supportive will ultimately shift their focus to the critical resources that the settlement provides to people and problems that need them."" The 24 states that have signed onto the deal, including Tennessee, Florida, West Virginia and Texas, as well as the municipal plaintiffs in nearly 2,300 cases consolidated in federal court, have said they wanted to secure guaranteed money from a bankruptcy that seemed inevitable. They want to begin addressing opioid-gouged public funds, they say, and to end litigation, which itself is crushingly expensive. The possibility of bankruptcy had been in the works since at least the summer of 2018, when Purdue named Steve Miller, a restructuring specialist who is widely known by his nickname, ""the Turnaround Kid,"" to chair its board and hired the law firm Davis, Polk & Wardwell, which has a large bankruptcy practice. The filing itself comes scarcely 48 hours after an announcement late Friday afternoon by the New York attorney general, Letitia James, that her office had uncovered almost a billion dollars in previously undisclosed wire transfers from Purdue to private accounts held by one of the Sacklers. The discovery came from just one of 33 subpoenas the state issued recently to financial institutions and advisers that have done business with the Sacklers.

The dismantling of a corporation to resolve litigation is not without precedent. The signature example is the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust, set up in 1988 from the 1982 bankruptcy restructuring of Johns Manville, the asbestos manufacturer, to resolve hundreds of thousands of claims for mesothelioma and other lung diseases. Another notable example is Dow Corning, a maker of silicone breast implants, which sought bankruptcy protection in 1995 to address thousands of lawsuits. But the Purdue case is, in some respects, unique. The list of Purdue's creditors consists overwhelmingly of the state and federal litigants. But the many thousands of claims that Johns Manville and Dow Corning had to settle were brought by individuals. Here, each of the 2,600 cases against Purdue represents thousands, and often, millions of citizens. Because the plaintiffs are governments, the states objecting to the proposal are expected to argue that their police authority to protect their citizens permits them to override the bankruptcy protections claimed by the Sacklers. But bankruptcy courts are federal; whether state law would be persuasive is unclear. Many other questions remain. The federal bankruptcy judge must decide whether the objections by the opposing states are sufficient to scuttle the deal or whether those states will have to be bound by the deal as well. Other nettlesome issues include the order in which the plaintiffs and their private lawyers will be paid, the respective amounts and, eventually, how those funds will be allocated to address the disaster. New York and other states have said in their filings that OxyContin, and opioids developed, distributed and sold by other companies, laid waste to hundreds of thousands of lives, depleting governmental resources. But throughout the two-decade-long public health crisis, the states say, the Sackler family transferred billions of dollars from Purdue to shell corporations and private accounts. These moves amount to ""fraudulent conveyance,"" the states say, a claim that may pierce the bankruptcy shield against litigation. Moreover, many states say, the Sacklers have violated individual states' consumer protection and fraud laws, which could give them the authority to pursue the Sacklers in their own courts.",The filing is a centerpiece of an agreement to settle thousands of cases against the company for its role in the opioids crises. But it is expected to be vigorously contested by many states.,7be41723-b27f-5d5f-9820-6816ed5bd347,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/15/business/00purdue1/00purdue1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=bc46f2fb6f06dc25cc75b9775999ef76204da0fbcfc7706db92e60377bf3476f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Purdue Pharma's headquarters in Stamford, Conn., on Thursday.",7be41723-b27f-5d5f-9820-6816ed5bd347,N24News/imgs/7be41723-b27f-5d5f-9820-6816ed5bd347.jpg,1
Movies,Viewing Party! Let's all Watch 'Jurassic Park',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/movies/jurassic-park.html,"Adapted from Michael Crichton's best seller, Steven Spielberg's megahit incubated a franchise that is far from extinct. Since its 1993 release, it has spawned the usual mixed bag of sequels and reboots, including the wildly popular ""Jurassic World"" in 2015. A further installment, ""Jurassic World: Dominion,"" is expected next year. There have been theme park rides, video games and T. rex toys. Driving all this profit and merch is the basic insight that inspired Spielberg, Crichton and the writer David Koepp: People love dinosaurs.

That's kind of funny, since on the evidence of ""Jurassic Park,"" they certainly don't love us, except in the way that some moviegoers love Twizzlers. But the big lizards -- or proto-birds, as Sam Neill's paleontologist would insist -- aren't the bad guys. They're female, for one thing, and are also simply acting according to the dictates of nature. They didn't ask to be cloned back into existence as theme-park attractions.","Does Steven Spielberg's 1993 blockbuster, with its ravenous dinosaurs and scientist heroes, still satisfy our hunger for action?",d27929c0-32c2-5d08-bb66-5e63b89cb114,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/25/arts/25weekendwatch/merlin_9962744_b0549fea-efaa-488b-8af6-3784b32be06e-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=79a0800f427ba8287157114c955566eed170e065595ac37444b6b625d1f90c31&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Joseph Mazello, left, Laura Dern and Sam Neill in a scene from the movie.",d27929c0-32c2-5d08-bb66-5e63b89cb114,N24News/imgs/d27929c0-32c2-5d08-bb66-5e63b89cb114.jpg,5
Opinion,"In Portland's So-Called War Zone, It's the Troops Who Provide the Menace",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/25/opinion/sunday/portland-protest-federal-troops.html,"In Portland's So-Called War Zone, It's the Troops Who Provide the Menace

PORTLAND, Ore. -- To watch Fox News is to learn from Sean Hannity that the ""Rose City"" of Portland is ""like a war zone"" that has been, in Tucker Carlson's words, ""destroyed by the mob."" So I invite Hannity and Carlson to escape their bubbles and visit Portland, stroll along the Willamette River and enjoy a glass of local pinot noir. They'll be safe -- unless they venture at night into the two blocks beside the federal courthouse. Citizens need to be vigilant there, for armed groups periodically storm the streets to attack peaceful visitors. I'm talking, of course, about the uninvited federal forces.

""They knocked the hell out of him,"" President Trump boasted on Fox News. ""That was the end of him."" Trump is pretending that he is bringing law and order to chaotic streets, and now he has dispatched similar troops -- what else can you call a militarized force like this but ""troops""? -- to Seattle, where that city's mayor has also said they are unwanted. Yet if Trump is actually trying to establish order, he is stunningly incompetent. The ruthlessness of the federal forces has inflamed the protests, bringing huge throngs of Portlanders out to protect their city from those they see as jackbooted federal thugs. ""Their presence here escalates,"" Kate Brown, Oregon's governor, told me. ""It throws gasoline on the fire."" Brown noted that the federal troops may also be breaking the law. ""We cannot have secret police abducting people into unmarked vehicles,"" she said. ""This is a democracy and not a dictatorship.""

The paradox is that Oregon is simultaneously begging for federal assistance to address a real threat -- the coronavirus pandemic. Brown said she has been pleading for Covid-19 tests and for personal protective equipment, but the federal government has rebuffed the state. ""It's appalling to me that they are using federal taxpayer dollars for political theater and making no effort to really keep our communities safe,"" Brown said. So let's be real: Trump isn't trying to quell violence in Portland. No, he's provoking it to divert attention from 140,000 Covid-19 deaths in the United States. Once again, he's tear-gassing peaceful protesters to generate a photo op -- and he's doing this every night in downtown Portland. This is a reckless campaign tactic to bolster his own narrative as a law-and-order candidate, a replay of Richard Nixon's successful 1968 campaign theme. It is true that some protesters are violent. Some start small trash fires. Others paint graffiti, including ""kill pigs"" and ""kill cops,"" or hurl water bottles or firecrackers at federal agents. Some protesters point lasers at officers and in one case a man allegedly hit an agent with a hammer. Such violence is wrong and plays into Trump's narrative. Representative John Lewis, who died earlier this month, showed how much more powerful it is for changemakers to endure violence than to commit it. But it's also true that the vast majority of those in the crowds each evening are peaceful. They sing about racial justice, chant ""Feds out now"" and try to protect their city from violent intruders dispatched by Trump.

The protesters -- including a ""Wall of Moms"" who turn out each night to lock arms and shield protesters -- protect themselves with bicycle helmets and umbrellas, while suburbanites bring leaf blowers to dispel tear gas (this works surprisingly well). Medics attend to the injured, and cleanup crews collect litter. ""They have guns; I have an umbrella,"" said a protester named Jackie -- who added that she was fearful of the government and did not want her last name published. That's common in dictatorships, but I find it ineffably sad to breathe tear gas in my beloved home state and to interview Americans with such fears of their own leaders. On the streets, I have no fear of the protesters (except when they pull their face masks down to shout slogans, risking the spread of Covid-19), but it's prudent to worry about the troops. In a few weeks, they:
* None fired ""less lethal"" munition at a peaceful protester named Donavan La Bella, fracturing his skull and requiring facial reconstruction surgery. Video shows that the shot was unprovoked.
* None clubbed a Navy veteran, Christopher J. David, as he tried to ask federal agents how they squared their actions with the Constitution.
* None allegedly sexually assaulted a lawyer who had been arrested after taking part in the ""Wall of Moms."" An iconic moment came when a woman known as Naked Athena confronted the troops while wearing only a hat and face mask. Her naked vulnerability as armed troops fired pepper balls at her feet underscored the absurdity of Trump's narrative that he is ""protecting"" anything. Beware. What you're seeing in Portland may be coming to other cities. After all, Trump's verdict on the troops: ""In Portland, they've done a fantastic job.""

Style,There's a Reason You're Drinking So Much Aperol Spritz,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/17/style/aperol-spritz-drink-summer.html,"If you think you've seen more Aperol spritzes this year, you're not wrong. And if you've been drinking more of those sparkling red-orange drinks in pretty stemmed glasses, you're doing exactly what the makers of Aperol at Campari hoped for. ""We saw there was a growing interest in Aperol in the U.S., especially at summer events and destinations,"" said Melanie Batchelor, the vice president of marketing at Campari America. ""We invested behind that."" The citrusy bitter liqueur has been popular in Italy since the 1950s, but it took a coordinated push to bring ""sunshine in a glass,"" as Ms. Batchelor described it, to the United States. The marketing plan was a savvy one: It started in New York with a flurry of Aperol spritz booths that were installed at popular summertime events, including the Jazz Age Lawn Party and Governors Ball. In the Hamptons last summer, Campari turned a little scooter car into a bar and drove it around offering free spritzes. The company also wrapped a Hampton Jitney -- a bus that transports weekenders from Manhattan to the Hamptons -- in full Aperol orange, with a spritz recipe and the message, ""So it's orange-y and bubbly at the same time. Plus it's super popular in Italy, so you know it's good.""

That the drink is an attention-grabbing orange certainly helps. At Aperol-adjacent events, it's not unusual to see friends posing for photos, clinking their spritzes in the sun. And they might even be wearing Aperol accessories. Campari merch -- Aperol spritz-themed wine glasses, straws, umbrellas, sunglasses and orange fans -- has infiltrated social feeds. The strategy seems to be working. According to Nielsen, Aperol sales rose 48 percent since last summer. ""It's not just in New York. We're seeing strong growth with Aperol across the country,"" Ms. Batchelor said.

Over the last five years, Aperol has become a staple liqueur for many bartenders and can be found on menus all over the city, several New York restaurateurs said. But it wasn't until this year, they all agreed, that we could declare it the drink of the summer. (Some maintain the Campari spritz is next.) At Caffe Dante in the Greenwich Village, the classic Aperol spritz is so popular that it is kept on tap, like beer. The drink is poured from a 10-gallon keg, and garnished with an orange slice and an olive. ""We have a special aerator for it,"" said Will Oxenham, the beverage director there. ""It speeds up the process, and keeps the flavor consistent and violently refreshing."" He noted that as recently as 2016, ""people were still drinking oceans of rose"" and few people were ordering Aperol spritzes, but this year and last, the bar has consistently gone through six to nine cases of Aperol a week. The bar also serves an Aperol ice pop. For Estelle Bossy, the bar director at La Sirena, putting a spin on the classic spritz was a bit of a mission. With more than a decade's experience in the beverage industry, she knew that the classic Aperol spritz would be popular this summer, so she decided to up her game by creating a frozen Aperol spritz in the style of frose (a rose wine slushie). Ms. Bossy's concoction is made with Aperol, prosecco, grapefruit juice, lemon, orange flower water and vodka, served in a chilled goblet with a small stem, and garnished with a huskberry.

""I wanted you to look at it and think of ice cream soda or a gorgeous parfait,"" she said. ""I wanted people to see it and just go, 'O.K., I've got to have that.'"" The frozen Aperol drink has been, without competition, the restaurant's most popular summer beverage, Ms. Bossy said. On the day of the Pride parade, the restaurant made about 600 of them.

In Harlem, the French restaurant Barawine has become a popular spot to grab a spritz. Filip Maksimovic, the head bartender there, said he has made more Aperol spritzes this year than in the previous two years combined. ""Last year, I went through a bottle, maybe two, of Aperol per month, but this year we're going through a case of six,"" Mr. Maksimovic said. ""And for a bar where most people come for the French wine, that's a lot."" The spike in Aperol consumption is in line with a rising demand in the United States for herbal bitter liqueurs, or amaro, more generally. Traditionally these bitters, including Cynar, Campari and Fernet-Branca, have been produced in Europe. But now, American-made versions are beginning to hit the market.","It's officially the drink of the summer, thanks to an aggressive marketing campaign by Campari.",819cad4a-1aa5-5fe1-a3fa-320caef2815c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/19/fashion/17APEROLSPRITZ-1/17APEROLSPRITZ-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=5eb9b13b2ec40a63fbcdc4683dd6f8bf39ed0a337c34d1b166d5ce22a183aa62&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"An Aperol spritz at Barawine, in Harlem.

Science,A Dinosaur With a Beak and Feathers Unearthed in China,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/science/dinosaur-mud-dragon.html,"Tongtianlong limosus, an unusual birdlike dinosaur, was unearthed in the Ganzhou region of China.

It had feathers and a beak. It was the size of a donkey, and it did not fly. It was not a bird, but a dinosaur that was a close relative of birds. In a paper published on Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports, a team of scientists described a fossil of Tongtianlong limosus, a new species in a strange group of dinosaurs that lived during the final 15 million years before dinosaurs became extinct. ""They just look weird,"" said Stephen L. Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and one of the authors of the paper. Dr. Brusatte described it as ""alien-looking"" with a pug-nose skull and a crest.

Tongtianlong limosus -- the name means ""muddy dragon on the road to heaven"" -- is the sixth from the region of Ganzhou. This particular fossil was unearthed four years ago by fortunate happenstance during the construction of a school. ""This one was found by workmen who were blasting with dynamite,"" Dr. Brusatte said. ""It's a fine line sometimes between discovery and knowing nothing."" The fossil made its way to Junchang Lu, a paleontologist at the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences in Beijing, who had earlier studied another oviraptorosaur from Ganzhou. (A construction boom there has created a fossil-discovery boom.) The fossil was found in an unusual posture, its limbs splayed and head raised. The scientists think it had become trapped in a quagmire and had died as it tried to pull itself out. ""It is the first oviraptorid dinosaur preserved as struggling,"" Dr. Lu wrote in an email.

Dr. Brusatte, who had collaborated with Dr. Lu on earlier projects, joined the study of Tongtianlong. Oviraptorosaurs are not direct ancestors of birds, but share a common theropod dinosaur ancestor with the lineage that later evolved to birds. Some features like the feathers come from the common ancestor, for display to potential mates or other creatures. ""They were like advertising billboards,"" Dr. Brusatte said. The common ancestor had teeth, though, not beaks. For oviraptorosaurs, the beaks were ""convergent evolution,"" when similar features evolve independently among different groups of animals. One of the unknowns is what Tongtianlong and other oviraptorosaurs were eating. Unlike better known theropods like velociraptors, ""this guy was not a traditional meat eater,"" Dr. Brusatte said. Perhaps it munched plants, nuts, insects, small animals or mollusks, Dr. Brusatte said. Or perhaps it ate a variety of foods. Or, as in birds, the beaks varied in shape among different species to feed in different ecological niches.

""Beaks are really good multipurpose tools,"" Dr. Brusatte said. The six Ganzhou oviraptorosaur species discovered so far are also very different from each other, and the scientists argue that this shows rapid evolution of these dinosaurs. That runs counter to the assertion of some paleontologists that dinosaurs were already in decline long before they became extinct 66 million years ago, most likely from the global devastation following a large asteroid impact.

""This specimen is going to give us a much better idea how oviraptorosaurs are related to each other,"" said Amy Balanoff, a scientist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore who was not involved with the research. ""One of the interesting things about these specimens that are coming out of southern China is that they show this diversity of body forms."" She was less certain about whether the rate of evolution is as fast as Dr. Brusatte argues, because the scientists lack precise dating of the layer of rock hundreds of yards thick where the fossils have been found. ""You don't know if it's a million years or 10 million years,"" she said.","Construction workers dynamiting rock for a new school unearthed the fossil of an ""alien-looking"" dinosaur.",66458d76-1ab5-5d1e-b35e-57bb6832752c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/11/science/10DINO2/10DINO2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=6452e5065903d5cb422165056974e04c1bc2b1cb67c32a2ea70c2f84b1a1d6b4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"An artist's rendering depicts the oviraptorosaur, flailing while mired in mud more than 66 million years ago.

Health,"As Opioid Panel Meets, Some Say Action, Not Study, Is Needed",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/16/health/donald-trump-opioid-panel.html,"WASHINGTON -- Weeks before the presidential election, at a packed rally in New Hampshire, Donald J. Trump recounted the story of a young woman and her boyfriend who had fatally overdosed within a year of each other. He promised not just a border wall to keep drugs out, but also more access to treatment. ""We're going to take care of it,"" he said of the opioid addiction epidemic, which has disproportionately hit states that were crucial to his election victory. ""What's taking so long?"" Five months into his term, though, President Trump has enthusiastically supported a health care bill that would deeply cut the Medicaid program that has provided treatment to thousands of addicted Americans. He has yet to fill the nation's top public health and drug policy jobs. And while he has appointed a bipartisan commission on the opioid crisis, which held its first official meeting on Friday, it remains to be seen how much attention the panel can command from Mr. Trump's turbulent administration. Some addiction specialists say that waiting for a commission's recommendations when hundreds of people are dying each week -- and when countless groups around the country have studied the issue already -- is wasting time. What is really needed, the specialists say, is the type of concerted, emergency action that public health officials have used to fight outbreaks of infectious diseases.

""There really isn't anything this commission is going to figure out that we don't know already,"" said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, who directs opioid policy research at Brandeis University's Heller School for Social Policy and Management. ""What we need is an enormous federal investment in expanding access to addiction treatment, and for the different federal agencies that have a piece of this problem to be working in a coordinated fashion."" Many experts, including Dr. Kolodny, say they believe that former President Barack Obama was also slow and, until the end of his tenure, ineffective at addressing the opioid problem. Some think his administration was so focused on rolling out the Affordable Care Act that it overlooked the public health crisis that was unfolding in the meantime. ""It would not be hard for Trump to do better than Obama on the opioid crisis,"" Dr. Kolodny said. The opioid commission's first meeting was attended by Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser; Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor; and Tom Price, the health and human services secretary. Several members said the threat to Medicaid expansion was among their top concerns. ""It is the elephant in the room,"" said Patrick Kennedy, the former Democratic congressman from Rhode Island, who has had struggles with addiction. ""It is the largest provider of coverage for people with mental illness and addiction in this country, so we have to mention the fact that any repeal of Medicaid is a repeal of coverage we currently have out there.""

The cuts were far less severe in the official budget proposal that Mr. Trump submitted last month -- about 3 percent instead of 95 percent -- but Mr. Trump has proposed other cuts, including to the Community Development Block Grant Program, that could put certain drug treatment and mental and public health programs at risk. John P. Walters, who led the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President George W. Bush, said he hoped the Trump administration would approach the opioid problem with ""a much more extensive surveillance effort,"" saying a federal lag in reporting overdose data was ""shameful."" ""I think we need a revolution here, and at its essence has to be to truly understand this as an epidemic and begin to map it, follow up, find individuals who are at risk and more aggressively encourage them to get treatment,"" he said. On the interdiction side, ""you need to treat this like a live shooter incident,"" Mr. Walters added. ""If somebody is distributing something that you now know is causing people to collapse and be at the risk of death, you need to try to find them and stop them, not just have extra bandages to treat the wounded. We're not there yet."" Mr. Trump's budget proposal calls for an additional $103 million for the Department of Justice to fight the flow of heroin and other illicit drugs into the country. In April, the Trump administration sent nearly $500 million to the states for addiction treatment through a new law, the 21st Century Cures Act, which was enacted with bipartisan support last year and signed by Mr. Obama. It will provide an additional $500 million next year. Another law passed last year, the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act, is also helping expand treatment and prevention through grants.

While these new funds are important, some state and local officials and advocates insist it is more critical to preserve expanded Medicaid and the ""essential benefits"" that the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover, including addiction and mental health treatment. ""We laid it on the line for Secretary Price,"" said Representative Ann McLane Kuster, Democrat of New Hampshire. She was describing a recent meeting with Mr. Price, who has declared the opioid crisis one of his top priorities. ""Virtually every single person at that meeting, as we went around the table, said we cannot lose Medicaid expansion or people will die."" The bill that the House passed in March to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act would phase out Medicaid expansion by 2020 by eliminating the extra federal funding that covered most of the cost. With the Senate now finishing its own bill, a group of moderate Republicans is pushing for a phaseout over seven years, not three.

One of the senators, Mr. Portman, said that instead of limiting 21st Century Cures money for treatment to $1 billion over two years, another option would be to continue that funding stream indefinitely to provide addiction treatment to those who would lose Medicaid. ""I'd like to see everyone move faster,"" Mr. Portman said. ""But I feel like we're beginning to put in place a comprehensive approach that will help us turn a corner."" Mr. Trump's executive order creating the opioid commission said the panel was supposed to produce an interim report by the end of this month and a final report by Oct. 1. The commission is then supposed to ""terminate,"" unless Mr. Trump decides on an extension.

Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican whom Mr. Trump appointed to lead the commission, did not respond to a request for an interview. But another member, Bertha K. Madras, a Harvard Medical School professor who specializes in addiction biology, said she had exhaustively studied data in preparation for Friday's meeting, at which addiction specialists and advocates made recommendations about treatment, access to overdose-reversing drugs and other issues. ""The fact that the commission is small is very positive,"" Dr. Madras said. ""If you pick five ferociously committed, dedicated people -- zealots -- you can get a lot done."" Besides Mr. Kennedy, the other members are Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, a Republican, and Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a Democrat. Although Mr. Trump did not attend the meeting, Mr. Christie told those present, ""I can tell you the president cares deeply about this issue and he is prepared to involve himself directly and personally in trying to lift the stigma across the country."" Kriss Blevens, a makeup artist and advocate for addiction issues in Manchester, N.H., whose stepdaughter died of a heroin overdose in 2014, is not so sure that any of this amounts to meaningful progress. Ms. Blevens joined Mr. Trump at a round-table discussion about the opioid crisis in Manchester last fall and conveyed to him ""my passion for what needed to be done,"" she said. ""I feel like I'm in the dark,"" she said, adding that she is still waiting for evidence that Mr. Trump is taking on the crisis.

Global Business,"European Auto Sales Rebound, but With an Asterisk",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/18/business/global/european-auto-sales-rebound-but-with-an-asterisk.html,"European auto sales broke an 18-month losing streak in April, industry data showed on Friday. But don't pop open the Champagne just yet: the increase was mostly a trick of the calendar.

New car registrations in the 27-nation European Union rose 1.7 percent in April from a year earlier, the first increase since September 2011, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association reported from Brussels.

But the association pegged that improvement mainly to the fact that April had two more business days this year than last.

Cara McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the automakers' association, said that was because the Easter holiday fell in March this year instead of in April as in 2012. Even with the extra days, she said, the year-over-year comparison was underwhelming, as car sales in April 2012 in the European Union were the worst on record for that month.","New passenger car registrations in the European Union rose 1.7 percent in April, the first increase since September 2011, but mainly because of a calendar quirk.",4adb60b2-9d9a-5f33-aec7-60e6ffb76924,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/18/business/EUCars/EUCars-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=8dda176c83d83ce487798ad170f143016ca29a31a24fb588ef938d1cc79e8b6f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"A Renault showroom in Bordeaux, France.

Theater,Hillary Clinton's in the House,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/theater/hillary-clinton-broadway-shows.html,"In many ways she is the typical Broadway audience member: a woman of a certain age, affluent and highly educated, living in suburban New York.

But there's one big difference: She was almost president of the United States.

In the weeks since losing the election, Hillary Clinton has gone to four Broadway shows -- often enough that industry wags joke about making her a Tony voter. And she's even been spotted at theater district haunts -- last week, just before seeing a revival of ""Sunset Boulevard,"" she had dinner at Orso with Kate McKinnon, the ""Saturday Night Live"" cast member who memorably portrayed her during the campaign.

At each theater appearance, Mrs. Clinton is greeted as a vanquished hero -- standing ovations, selfies, shouted adulation.

The reception, of course, is in striking contrast with that received by Mike Pence, then the vice president-elect, when he attended ""Hamilton"" in November. He was greeted by a smattering of boos and then addressed from the stage by an actor who said cast members were ""alarmed and anxious"" about the incoming administration.","For Broadway audiences, she's become a familiar sight — and another reason to applaud.",6336a41e-a512-5bbf-bdc8-27b080e7ae8b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/18/arts/21HILLARY-INTRO/21HILLARY-INTRO-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=8e59ffcd375b744eac2691df4ff09ca7fb82ff0b0b74175684609c1e70049d41&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Hillary Clinton chatting backstage with Glenn Close, star of ""Sunset Boulevard.""",6336a41e-a512-5bbf-bdc8-27b080e7ae8b,N24News/imgs/6336a41e-a512-5bbf-bdc8-27b080e7ae8b.jpg,10
Science,"People Are Seeing U.F.O.s Everywhere, and This Book Proves It",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/science/ufo-sightings-book.html,"People Are Seeing U.F.O.s Everywhere, and This Book Proves It

SYRACUSE -- Why have sightings of unidentified flying objects around the nation more than tripled since 2001? Why is July the busiest month for U.F.O. sightings? Why did they spike in Texas in 2008, or in New Mexico in September 2015? And how in the world, or out of it, has Manhattan racked up New York State's second-highest tally of U.F.O. sightings in this century? These questions and many others emerge from the first comprehensive statistical summary of so-called close encounters: 121,036 eyewitness accounts, organized county by county in each state and the District of Columbia, from 2001 to 2015. The unlikely compendium, ""U.F.O. Sightings Desk Reference,"" is the work of a couple in Syracuse, who crunched unruly data on U.F.O. reports collected by two volunteer organizations: the Mutual U.F.O. Network, or Mufon, and the National U.F.O. Reporting Center, or Nuforc.

It is the reference ""U.F.O. researchers dreamed of having,"" Gordon G. Spear, emeritus professor of physics and astronomy at Sonoma State University in California, writes in the foreword. The book contains no narrative or anecdotal accounts, just 371 pages of charts and graphs that slice and dice the geography and timing of the incidents and the various shapes that witnesses reported: flying circles, spheres, triangles, discs, ovals, cigars. Many of the sightings turn out to be explainable, the authors say, but a small percentage defy resolution. The authors are Cheryl Costa, 65, a former military technician and aerospace analyst, and her wife, Linda Miller Costa, 62, a librarian at Le Moyne College and a former librarian at the National Academy of Sciences, NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency.

Cheryl Costa was writing New York Skies, a U.F.O. blog for The Syracuse New Times, when the Costas decided to expand their tallies of U.F.O. sightings nationwide. ""We wanted to do our bit for disclosure,"" she said. ""It's something the government should have been doing."" The Costas realize some might find this a strange way to spend weekends. But both say they have spotted U.F.O.s themselves and want to detoxify the subject. ""We're doing scientific research,"" Cheryl Costa said. ""What's crazy is not being willing to look at research."" She came to the collaboration roundabout, having served as a cable lineman in the Air Force in Vietnam, and afterward in the Navy's submarine service, as a man before undergoing gender-reassignment surgery in the 1980s. Ordained as a Buddhist nun, she was running a theater group in Maryland when she met Linda. They wed in 2011. ""With this compendium, Cheryl and Linda Costa have reminded the public and the media the extraterrestrial phenomenon continues unabated,"" said Stephen Bassett, founder and executive director of the Paradigm Research Group, which lobbies for disclosure of official U.F.O. records. Rebutting a common perception that U.F.O. sightings are on the wane, the Costas' book shows that sightings have risen in waves, to 11,868 nationwide in 2015 from 3,479 in 2001. Only a small fraction of sightings are actually reported to Mufon or Nuforc.

Their labor of love is about the numbers, just the numbers, and the Costas refrain from speculating on what exactly is happening. ""We really don't know,"" Linda Costa said. ""But all these people are seeing these things."" The government officially quit the U.F.O. business in 1968, with the finding in the Condon report from the University of Colorado that there was nothing significant to investigate, although some 30 percent of the incidents were unexplained. Mufon's 500 volunteer investigators, however, continue to check out many of the sightings reported to the group. Roger Marsh, a Mufon spokesman, said that of the 270 cases his group investigated in Manhattan from 2002 through 2016, 44 eluded explanation and remained ""unknown."" One of the most intriguing occurred on the afternoon of Sept. 17, 2011, when a man on the roof terrace of the New Museum on the Bowery photographed a fast-moving diamond-shaped object with windows and flashing blue and red lights against the TriBeCa skyline.

According to Mufon, it resembled an unknown flying object photographed in Round Rock, Tex., two weeks earlier. The Costas listed 426 sightings in New York County from 2001 to 2015, second in the state's tallies only to Suffolk County, on the tip of Long Island, with 554. How so many sightings in the nation's densest core and around its toniest beach resorts have escaped wider notoriety is just part of the mystery.

For the U.F.O. enthusiast, the pages of graphs and charts are a treasure trove of hard-to-find detail. The District of Columbia, with 9,856 people per square mile, had the fewest sightings: 154. (A political snub from deep space?) Wyoming, with 5.8 people per square mile, had more than twice as many: 337. Fireballs made up nearly 8 percent of the sightings in Indiana (230) and fewer than 5 percent in Colorado (157). California, the most populous state, led the nation in U.F.O. reports (15,836, more than the next two states, Florida and Texas, combined). Los Angeles County alone had more sightings than 40 states, followed by Maricopa County, Ariz., which includes Phoenix. Population fails to explain the figures conclusively, the Costas said. Washington State, with 6.7 million people according to the 2010 census, ranks No. 4 in sightings, ahead of Pennsylvania, with 12.7 million people, and New York State, with 19 million. Rather, the Costas theorize, the figures may reflect good West Coast weather, which draws more people outside where they may spot U.F.O.s. Nationwide sightings peak in July, they found, and drop off between December and February. Still, in Mississippi, U.F.O. reports spike in January and November; in New Mexico, in September. The arduous breakdown by the nation's more than 3,000 counties was notable for revealing clusters of sightings in remote regions, places where U.F.O.s are almost never mentioned. But every county in the United States appears to have seen at least one U.F.O. In the end, the Costas noted, the spikes may have a lot to do with media coverage.","An unlikely new reference guide breaks down U.F.O. sightings county by county, shape by shape, month by month.",9fb5c440-8249-5b1c-a759-31c95b63a596,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/25/science/25sci-ufo-web/25sci-ufo-web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=8d3e832052cb0618729e67cc7a8cbc0506c6bcf25f5feac9ac96994c135d33f6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A protest in Washington, D.C., in 1995 outside the offices of the General Accounting Office.",9fb5c440-8249-5b1c-a759-31c95b63a596,N24News/imgs/9fb5c440-8249-5b1c-a759-31c95b63a596.jpg,2
Books,How the Astro Poets Lit Up the Internet,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/books/astro-poets-twitter.html,"The universe is a swirling cosmic cocktail of galaxies made up of specks of dust, and Alex Dimitrov and Dorothea Lasky are alive and writing poetry in it. The two poets, who are also best friends and creative collaborators, are always thinking about the stars. The first thing the pair ever talked about, when they met in a Brooklyn loft in 2010, while drinking cheap champagne at an after-party for a poetry reading, was the movement of the constellations. ""Alex walked up to me and told me he was a Sagittarius,"" said Ms. Lasky, 39. ""And I knew, it was going to work. When a Sagittarius spots an Aries across a room, there's an immediate connection.""

""I used to tell everyone that Aries and Sagittarius are the strongest astrological match,"" said Mr. Dimitrov, 33. The poets were sitting across from me in a velvet banquette at the dark Temple Bar in the NoLIta neighborhood of Manhattan. Mr. Dimitrov cut a sleek profile, wearing a black leather jacket and a nonchalant smudge of kohl eyeliner. Ms. Lasky wore piles of jewelry on every exposed surface of her body, and looked like a modern incarnation of the elegant mystic Madame Blavatsky. Together, under the light of the dim Edison bulbs, they looked like members of a long-lost 1970s prog-rock band. ""Aries women just love me,"" Mr. Dimitrov went on. ""I wish I could get married to an Aries woman, but alas, I like men. So this is the next best thing. I guess we are in a 'spiritual marriage.' I always refer to our Twitter as a marriage."" The Twitter account he speaks of is Astro Poets, a feed of whimsical astrological musings that the two launched together in late November 2016 (their account is a Sagittarian) and that has grown exponentially in popularity since. The account now boasts more than 232,000 followers -- fans include the pop artists Lorde and Michelle Branch and the actor/writer Lena Dunham -- and a coveted book deal with Macmillan's Flatiron Books. (The book will be published in 2019.) The two recently hosted a sold-out poetry reading for 500 fans in the New York Public Library's Celeste Bartos Forum. The beige auditorium was sardined with admirers -- average age somewhere between 18 and 25, many with unicorn-hued, asymmetrical haircuts -- who came for a glimpse of their horoscope gurus.

The Astro Poets idea was born over text message, late at night. Ms. Lasky and Mr. Dimitrov, who are both published poets (Ms. Lasky with four books, Mr. Dimitrov two), were up into the wee hours in November of 2016 chatting about their favorite subjects: romance and astrology. Mr. Dimitrov had double-booked dates with two men, and he was waffling back and forth about which plans to cancel. He turned to a Twitter poll, and then directly to Ms. Lasky, for cosmic advice. ""I was choosing between a Taurus and a Virgo,"" he said.

""What's funny is, I didn't go on either date. But we did get the idea for the Twitter out of it,"" ""Mr. Dimitrov said. ""Every time we got dinner or drinks, we'd be talking about astrology the whole time. And we were like, let's take this to Twitter and see if people care."" As it turned out, people did care. The first tweet the Astro Poets posted was ""We've been born on this truest evening, November 26, 2016 in New York City. A Sagittarius babe we are & we love our planet & all the signs."" Within three days, the account had amassed more than 4,000 followers.

The mission of Astro Poets was simple: Use Twitter to write tiny poems about the star signs. Because Mr. Dimitrov and Ms. Lasky are creatures of the internet, they are as well-versed in pop culture as they are in literary history. As a result, the account has a very specific, charming tone, one that unites zeitgeisty interests with ancient knowledge about the solar system. A typical tweet will list the star signs as emoji, or punctuation marks. Early on, the pair developed the idea of ""the series,"" a quick list of 12 tweets describing all of the signs in terms of a single conceit. They described the signs in terms of Britney Spears songs, Virginia Woolf novels, adverbs and passive-aggressive email signoffs.

""I approach each series we do thinking about structure, really,"" Mr. Dimitrov said. ""I like the fact that there are 12 signs. I like the fact that there are the four elements. If you think about it, those are poetic constraints."" ""If I write a series, it's between 12 and 14 lines, which is a sonnet, basically,"" Ms. Lasky said. ""Being poets, we have skills in invoking the invisible,"" continued Ms. Lasky, whose fifth book, ""Milk,"" will be published by Wave Books this year. ""And I think one of the big misconceptions about poetry is that poems have to mean something. A poem has an infinite set of meanings. Anybody's star chart is like that too."" ""There is a long history connecting poets and the occult,"" said Mr. Dimitrov, whose latest book, ""Together and By Ourselves,"" came out from Copper Canyon Press in April 2017. ""I've definitely always been interested in conjuring."" Ms. Lasky said that she first became interested in astrology as a child, poring over the reclusive poet Linda Goodman's best-selling 1980s books on the subject. ""I devoured Linda Goodman's 'Star Signs,' "" she said. ""I kept the book by my bed all the time and my lamp burned a hole in the book. I think as an adult I got into astrology by just being obsessed with people to date. It felt like knowing astrology gave me a knowledge about people that they may not even have about themselves, and I was captivated by that."" Ms. Lasky said that she hopes the Astro Poets book will be a modern update of Goodman's work. ""We want it to be more intersectional and less problematic about gender,"" she said. ""Her book is more about men and women interacting and we want to make ours less binary."" Mr. Dimitrov, whose parents are not only both Sagittarians, like himself, but share a birthday, gave him a pendant of the Sagittarius archer symbol when he was young. ""I was super introverted, I was an only child,"" he said. ""So for me astrology was kind of like Greek mythology, this other world where I already had an identity; I could participate in it. There were no definite rules, much like poetry.""

The instant identity that comes along with simply knowing where one's birthday falls on the zodiac may hold some clue to the Astro Poets phenomenon, and the broader rise in popularity of astrology among millennial readers. Noah Eaker, the book editor who signed Ms. Lasky and Mr. Dimitrov, told me that he had been searching for some time ""to find the right authors for an astrological guide made for 21st century life."" Astrology is not a science. It is not necessarily conclusive. And yet, Ms. Lasky said, knowing your chart can provide a kind of interpretive map with which to solve problems or understand larger forces at work on your life. ""It's not just about your sun sign,"" she said. ""It's all like a fingerprint, molding together. Your moon sign and rising sign all form part of the blueprint of the house. But there is no fate weaving the blanket of our lives. What you do with the house is up to you.""","Their popular Twitter account draws over 230,000 followers, with fans including Lorde and Michelle Branch.

Fashion & Style,Future Had to Be Persuaded to Wear His Met Gala Look,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/fashion/future-prepares-for-met-gala.html,"Future Had to Be Persuaded to Wear His Met Gala Look

You see a lot while waiting for Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn, a.k.a. Future, at the Carlyle Hotel on the first Monday of May. You see, for example, Mel Ottenberg, Rihanna's longtime collaborator, carrying in bags to the singer's suite to complete her Comme des Garcons look. You see Jenna Lyons, the former J. Crew creative director, in the lobby checking in. And you see Jennifer Connelly stepping out of a car in a short Louis Vuitton frock while photographers lining the entrance yell her name. You see all of this because this isn't just any Monday in May. It's the day of the Met Gala. And the Carlyle is the epicenter of preparations for the fashion industry's elite. In that context, Future's room is pretty much a microcosm of the action taking place all over the hotel.

""Bobby picked it; he had to convince me to wear it,"" Future said of the H&M suit he was planning to wear to the ball (""Bobby"" being his stylist, Bobby Wesley Williams, who was tying a bow on his organic silk shirt). ""I feel good about it, I feel great about it,"" Future continued. Simon Hallin, a developer from H&M's design team who had flown in from Sweden, reached over to help him pin down the bow.

This would be the third time Future was attending the Met Gala. Last year, he wore a custom Ermenegildo Zegna suit, and in 2014, he wore a Calvin Klein suit by Italo Zucchelli, with whom he attended the event. This year, to pay homage to Rei Kawakubo, who was being honored, he chose a black tailcoat jacket embellished with a black skull and Swarovski crystal heart that was inspired by the Japanese designer. ""I feel like it's more artistic, more dramatic,"" Future said of his look this year. Mr. Williams, while keeping his eye on the fitting, said: ""I knew he wouldn't want to be in a traditional-type suit. It's mellow, cool and super-edgy. Taking more chances.""

""Is this bow tie supposed to be off?"" Future asked while carefully inspecting the alignment of the shirt's tie in the mirror. Mr. Williams replied, ""You know, with your earrings, it's more rock star."" From the rapper's ear hung a safety-pin earring from Enfants Riches Deprimes. ""He's from Atlanta; that's my boy,"" Future said of the brand's designer, Henry Levy. Mr. Hallin was still thinking about the bow. ""It's sustainable as well,"" he chimed in. Future, who is known for his outre style and accessories, added a pair of gold Bottega Veneta glasses to complete his look. He has 150 to 200 pairs of sunglasses, Mr. Williams guessed. The rapper would describe his look as ""versatile,"" and when asked, he could rattle off his favorite designers without missing a beat: ""Saint Laurent jeans, Balmain jeans, Chanel ... Chanel is my favorite. Tom Ford, Linda Farrow shades, Valentino, Loewe, Stella McCartney, Dior, Bottega."" He's particularly into Gucci socks right now, too, though he thinks the brand may be becoming ""too trendy"" for him.

""It's always a fashion-forward event of what's to come,"" Future said of Vogue's annual gala. ""That's why you go to fashion shows; it's all about setting a trend. So that's what the Met Gala is great for."" And setting a trend is very important to Future. ""My style is always evolving because I'm always getting inspired,"" he said. ""You evolve with time. It's like a process when it comes to fashion."" To help, Mr. Williams scours Pinterest and Vogue.com in his free time researching up-and-coming labels like Martine Rose, Amiri and Fear of God.","We got ready with Nayvadius DeMun Wilburn, a.k.a.

Music,Grammys Tweak Use of 'Urban' as Music Industry Weighs a Loaded Term,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/arts/music/grammys-rules-urban.html,"Tyler, the Creator spoke out about being placed into a ""rap or urban"" category at this year's Grammys.





As protests over racial injustice continue to sweep the country, the music industry has come under renewed scrutiny, including from within. One ongoing issue is the term ""urban,"" which has drawn quick condemnation as a racist and outdated euphemism for genres like hip-hop and R&B that predominantly feature black artists. Some major record companies and broadcasters have already pledged to drop it. Now the Grammy Awards have entered into the fray, by removing the word from some categories yet adding it to another, as part of a series of rule changes announced on Wednesday. Starting with the 63rd annual ceremony, planned for January, best urban contemporary album will be called best progressive R&B album. In a statement, the Recording Academy, the organization that presents the Grammys, called this change ""a more accurate definition to describe the merit or characteristics"" of R&B music.

But in the Latin field, ""urban"" was dropped from one category yet added to another. Best Latin pop album will now be called Latin pop or urban; the category Latin rock, urban or alternative album has been shortened to Latin rock or alternative. The upshot of that change is that reggaeton albums -- still considered ""urban"" -- will now compete against top Latin pop hits. The discrepancy may partly be a result of awkward timing. As part of the Grammys' annual housekeeping process, proposals for rule changes were due in March, and the academy's board approved them a few weeks ago -- well before the music industry began its most recent steps to address systemic changes, a process that coalesced just a week ago with #BlackoutTuesday. Still, complaints over the term ""urban"" -- which date to 1970s radio formats -- have been simmering for years, with artists and industry insiders saying it segregates black artists and executives. At the most recent Grammys ceremony, in January, the performer Tyler, the Creator won best rap album -- for the eclectic, genre-crossing album ""Igor,"" which contained comparatively little rapping -- and told reporters that he considered the prize a ""backhanded compliment."" ""It sucks that whenever we -- and I mean guys that look like me -- do anything that's genre-bending or anything,"" he said, ""they always put it in a rap or urban category.""

He added, ""I don't like that 'urban' word. It's just a politically correct way to say the N-word to me."" In a statement explaining the changes, an academy spokeswoman said: ""At the time that this category amendment proposal was put forth earlier in the year, use of the word urban when classifying certain genres in Latin music was widely accepted. However, we understand that in the current climate, sentiment might be changing. We are continuing to follow the conversation and are committed to making necessary adjustments."" Among the other changes announced by the Grammys:
* None The best rap/sung performance category, which had been known as rap/sung collaboration until 2017, has been renamed once again, to best melodic rap performance -- an acknowledgment of how many young hip-hop acts blur the line between rapping and singing.
* None Eligibility rules for best new artist, one of the most prestigious categories -- and one where the rules are frequently contested -- have been adjusted. Previously, artists could be disqualified for having released more than 30 tracks or three albums in their career; instead, the Grammys' screening committees will now decide whether an artist's moment of ""breakthrough or prominence"" came before the current year. The Grammys also addressed questions of conflicts of interest in its nominations committees, the teams of industry experts that review submissions and finalize the names on the ballot in many categories. Grievances about that process have been bubbling for years, but burst into the open in January through a legal complaint from Deborah Dugan, the academy's ousted chief executive. She claimed that the academy allowed people affiliated with eligible artists to sit on review committees, and that academy board members skewed ballots toward artists they are affiliated with. The academy has denied those charges.

Sports,Michael Avenatti Is Accused in Nike Extortion Attempt,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/sports/michael-avenatti-extortion-nike.html,"Michael Avenatti, the lawyer best known for representing the pornographic film star Stormy Daniels in her lawsuits against President Trump, arrived in New York on Monday for a negotiating session with Nike executives that he believed could net him millions of dollars. Armed with sensitive information, Mr. Avenatti approached the meeting as though he had the upper hand. He left in the custody of F.B.I. agents. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan filed charges accusing him of trying to extort millions of dollars from the apparel giant in exchange for evidence he said he had of misconduct by company employees in the recruitment of college basketball players. The arrest of Mr. Avenatti, who in a separate case was charged by federal prosecutors in California with bank and wire fraud, was the latest development in a spectacular fall by a lawyer who is known for orbiting and representing an array of celebrities and who has been central to some of the most salacious headlines about Mr. Trump.

In court documents filed Monday, prosecutors said that Mr. Avenatti and a client, a basketball coach for a traveling youth team, had threatened a flurry of negative publicity right before a Nike earnings call and the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament. Prosecutors said Mr. Avenatti had told Nike that he and the basketball coach, said to be Gary Franklin Sr. of the club team California Supreme in Los Angeles, had evidence that Nike employees had funneled money to recruits in violation of N.C.A.A. rules. Mr. Franklin could not be reached for comment. The prosecutors said Mr. Avenatti and the coach had threatened to release the evidence in an attempt to damage Nike's reputation and market capitalization unless the company paid them at least $22.5 million. Geoffrey S. Berman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, based in Manhattan, said at a news conference that Mr. Avenatti's conduct amounted to a ""shakedown.""

Mr. Avenatti was released Monday evening on $300,000 bond and under several conditions, including restrictions on travel. In a brief news conference after his release, Mr. Avenatti said he was ""highly confident"" that when all the evidence was presented, he would be ""fully exonerated, and justice will be done."" A veteran plaintiffs lawyer, Mr. Avenatti rose to fame in March 2018 when he filed a lawsuit against Mr. Trump on behalf of Ms. Daniels, who said that she had an affair with Mr. Trump and then received a hush-money payment leading up to the 2016 election. Mr. Avenatti became a fixture on cable news, leveraging Ms. Daniels's case to build his own profile as a foil to Mr. Trump. He was even taken half-seriously when he declared that he was interested in making a presidential run in 2020. Ms. Daniels's suit, which sought to invalidate a nondisclosure agreement, was dismissed by a federal judge in California this month, and a separate defamation suit Mr. Avenatti filed against Mr. Trump on Ms. Daniels's behalf was dismissed late last year. The discussion about Ms. Daniels, however, has remained a leading sore point for the Trump administration, as checks made out to her with the president's signature on them were given to Congress last month by his former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, who has pleaded guilty to federal charges. Last September, Mr. Avenatti inserted himself into the confirmation hearings of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. The week before Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed, Mr. Avenatti announced that he had a new client, Julie Swetnick. Ms. Swetnick said that she had witnessed sexual misconduct by Justice Kavanaugh and some of his friends at high school parties in the Washington area in the early 1980s, when she was a college student in Maryland. As Mr. Avenatti's national profile grew, so did his legal and financial troubles. He was arrested in Los Angeles in November on suspicion of domestic violence, which he called an effort to intimidate him, though he was not charged with a crime. His firm, formerly known as Eagan Avenatti, has repeatedly filed for bankruptcy, most recently on March 7, in Santa Ana, Calif. The charging documents in the Nike case refer to an unnamed co-conspirator, another lawyer who worked with Mr. Avenatti. That lawyer is Mark Geragos, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the continuing investigation.

Mr. Geragos, a top celebrity lawyer, is best known in the sports world for representing the former quarterback Colin Kaepernick in his collusion case against the N.F.L., which was recently settled. He also played a role in Mr. Kaepernick's negotiations with Nike over 2017 and 2018, which resulted in Nike's making Mr. Kaepernick one of its highest paid football endorsers and a face of a new advertising campaign. Mr. Geragos did not respond to phone calls or an email seeking comment. Mr. Berman declined to say why Mr. Geragos had not been arrested. He said the investigation was continuing. Federal officials announced the charges around the same time that Mr. Avenatti, in a post on his Twitter account, announced that he would hold a news conference on Tuesday to accuse Nike of ""a major high school/college basketball scandal."" In the past week, he has also privately reached out to reporters, telling them that he had explosive information about a major company.

Last year, two former employees of Adidas were among those convicted of fraud for participating in a similar scheme, outlined by prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, in which families of recruits were paid in exchange for their sons' commitments to college teams sponsored by Adidas. In a statement, Nike said it ""will not be extorted or hide information that is relevant to a government investigation. Nike has been cooperating with the government's investigation into N.C.A.A. basketball for over a year."" Nike said that it had immediately called federal prosecutors when it became aware of the matter and that it had worked with the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner to assist in the investigation.

According to people with knowledge of the cases, once Nike heard Mr. Avenatti's claims, it acted to inform federal officials of the allegation that the company's employees were paying players. The nature of the discussion with Mr. Avenatti raised the possibility that extortion was taking place. In the case filed in California on Monday, Mr. Avenatti was charged with embezzling from a client and with defrauding a bank by using false tax returns to obtain loans. Nicola T. Hanna, the United States Attorney in Los Angeles, said the two cases were unrelated, but the authorities in California and New York coordinated to arrest Mr. Avenatti and execute search warrants at the same time. In the Nike case, the federal prosecutors said Mr. Avenatti had represented a coach, later identified as Mr. Franklin, whose team recently did not have a contract with Nike renewed, according to the court documents. Mr. Avenatti told Nike that he had evidence that at least three former high school players had been paid by Nike in ways that were intended to be concealed, the documents said. California Supreme had three alumni taken in the 2018 N.B.A. draft, including Deandre Ayton of the Phoenix Suns. Mr. Avenatti, according to prosecutors, threatened that he would hold a news conference when it could maximally disrupt Nike: before its quarterly earnings call last week, which coincided with the start of the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament. The tournament is among the biggest annual events on the sports calendar, featuring many prominent teams that are sponsored by Nike, like Duke, North Carolina and Kentucky. Mr. Avenatti said he would refrain from publicizing his evidence if Nike paid $1.5 million to his client, the court documents said, though prosecutors did not name Mr. Franklin. Mr. Avenatti also demanded that Nike hire him and another lawyer to conduct an internal investigation, for billings worth between $15 million and $25 million, court documents said.

As an alternative, prosecutors said, Mr. Avenatti said he would accept $22.5 million from Nike for himself and his client in exchange for not releasing the evidence. According to the complaint, Mr. Avenatti told Nike that his client's information, if publicized, would ultimately lower the value of Nike stock by billions of dollars. He believed that once he went public, parents, coaches and players all across the country would reach out to him with information about payments that violated N.C.A.A. rules. ""The company will die -- not die, but they are going to incur cut after cut after cut after cut, and that's what's going to happen as soon as this thing becomes public,"" Mr. Avenatti said in a meeting with Nike lawyers that was recorded for video and audio. Nike, Adidas and Under Armour sponsor dozens of basketball teams for high school players that compete mainly in the summer. The equipment companies shower those teams with tens of thousands of dollars in financing and apparel, and also organize huge tournaments attended by the country's most prominent college coaches. More than high school basketball, these leagues represent the hub of recruiting for college basketball programs. The 2017 charges of corruption against former Adidas employees and several other figures in college basketball, including assistant coaches at major programs, rocked the sport and prompted the firing of Rick Pitino, the Hall of Fame coach at Louisville. There have been three convictions in the case so far and several guilty pleas.","Federal prosecutors have accused Michael Avenatti and a client, a club team basketball coach, of attempting to extort millions of dollars from Nike.",f564f960-b9e2-5871-960d-d4b120383815,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/25/sports/25avenatti-01/25avenatti-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=622ce9425f7a71eae1ea051743f97dac93c4d8f2cbf42d59844663b94f200600&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Michael Avenatti, a lawyer, was arrested and charged with trying to extort millions of dollars from Nike through threats of negative publicity right before the company's earnings call.",f564f960-b9e2-5871-960d-d4b120383815,N24News/imgs/f564f960-b9e2-5871-960d-d4b120383815.jpg,9
Health,Teenage Vaping Rises Sharply Again This Year,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/health/vaping-teens-e-cigarettes.html,"""The flavor ban is reactive,"" said Dr. Sharon Levy, an adolescent addiction expert at Boston Children's Hospital. ""It's just a matter of time until companies figure out a way around it. We have to be more proactive.""

Dr. Levy said that just about every patient referred to her practice also vapes. Vaping has become normalized for teenagers, she added.

""Kids say that these devices have all the pleasures of cigarettes without the harm,"" said Dr. Levy. ""It's like a cup of coffee for them.""

She is particularly worried about the amount of nicotine that her patients are absorbing. She is even seeing cases of nicotine toxicity.

The main results are similar to preliminary figures released from a separate survey last week by Mr. Azar. The early results from the National Tobacco Youth Survey indicated an increase to 27.5 percent from 20 percent last year in e-cigarette use among teenagers asked if they had vaped in the last 30 days.

In the survey released Wednesday afternoon, students were asked for the first time if they had vaped on at least 20 days within the last 30 days, underscoring concerns that teenagers are becoming addicted to nicotine and the effects that the substance can have on the developing brain. Twelve percent of 12th-graders said they had vaped that frequently,

7 percent of 10-graders and 2 percent of 8th-graders.

""Current efforts by the vaping industry, government agencies, and schools have thus far proved insufficient to stop the rapid spread of nicotine vaping among adolescents,"" the researchers said. ""Of particular concern are the accompanying increases in the proportions of youth who are physically addicted to nicotine, an addiction that is very difficult to overcome once established. The substantial levels of daily vaping suggest the development of nicotine addiction.""","Preliminary figures from a national survey show that the prevalence of e-cigarette use among minors has doubled from 2017 through this year, despite national campaigns warning of the dangers.",fca2c8ff-5e74-553f-833a-1ac98aecc7ed,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/18/science/18VAPING1/18VAPING1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=10fa760906ac6475d31c166c5b8df6af349a4492800273edcc41094d4cd3655c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Students who had vaped nicotine during the previous 12 months and those who had ever vaped nicotine also significantly increased in each grade this year over last year.,fca2c8ff-5e74-553f-833a-1ac98aecc7ed,N24News/imgs/fca2c8ff-5e74-553f-833a-1ac98aecc7ed.jpg,1
Real Estate,The West Village: Wish List Satisfied,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/realestate/the-west-village-wish-list-satisfied.html,"The Buyers Vicki Baum and Steven Roth love the streamlined interior of their new home.

The M21 bus, which runs across Houston Street, is viewed with fondness by Vicki Baum and Steven Roth. Forty years ago, that's where they met. Both residents of the West Village, they got on the bus at the same stop one day and recognized each other from the neighborhood. The couple rented the top floor of a two-family Federal house on Vandam Street in the West Village, but had to move when the house was sold. ""We didn't even know it was for sale, unfortunately,"" Ms. Baum said. If they had known, they would have bought it. Ms. Baum, now 71, is a family therapist, and Dr. Roth, 65, is a psychologist, and they share an office on lower Fifth Avenue. Back around 1980, they checked out the Printing House on Hudson Street, which had been converted to a residential rental from an industrial building. The layouts they saw had low-ceilinged mezzanines, and seemed to them unsuitable for a couple with a daughter. They ended up buying a two-bedroom on the fifth floor of a small walk-up co-op building on West 11th Street in the West Village. When their daughter was grown and they no longer needed a second bedroom, they sold it and moved to a ground-floor one-bedroom in a prewar co-op on lower Fifth Avenue.

After a dozen years there, they were again ready for a change. ""We loved the prewar building but we didn't want to continue to live there,"" Dr. Roth said. The Village

A one-bedroom duplex on East 10th had the requisite two bathrooms. But a common garden was right out the window. Bryan Thomas for The New York Times This time around, they had a wish list forged by experience. Every summer, they had hauled two window air-conditioners out of storage, so now they wanted central air. They had hoped to add a second bathroom, but the contractor they consulted told them the plumbing wouldn't cooperate. ""We didn't want old pipes anymore,"" Ms. Baum said. The wish list also included a contemporary interior, two bathrooms and a gym in the building. Last spring, they walked into a storefront office of Brown Harris Stevens, where they met Bill Roche. They told him they wanted a place in the West Village. Their budget was around $1.4 million. ""There weren't a lot of options,"" Mr. Roche said. The kind of interior they sought was more common to the east of their target area, and it was difficult to find a one-bedroom with two bathrooms. Ms. Baum sometimes popped into buildings to ask the doorman about units coming available.

Sometimes, ""I got as far as the lobby, said nope and walked out,"" she said. ""Not that anything wasn't pleasant, but I could just tell from the building it didn't feel like home."" Often, buildings seemed too much like their co-op -- beautiful but with prewar interiors. A ground-floor duplex unit in an 1870 medium-size co-op building on East 10th Street had the requisite one bedroom and two bathrooms. The price was $1.295 million, with monthly maintenance of almost $1,200. But a shared garden was right outside the window. The Village

At the Cast Iron Building, a duplex with a private terrace was appealing. Someone else snapped it up. Bryan Thomas for The New York Times ""In the summer, there you are sitting in your living room and looking out your glass door and you see other people sitting in the garden,"" Ms. Baum said. ""The thought of that wasn't too appealing. You have window treatments -- but still."" The apartment also needed renovation. It later sold for $1.25 million. But they found themselves liking duplexes, which seemed roomy. They were drawn to a one-bedroom in the 1870 Cast Iron Building, once a department store, on East 11th Street. ""I have a friend who lives in there and I loved her apartment,"" Ms. Baum said. ""This one was bigger."" The place, another ground-floor duplex, had a private terrace. The price was $1.48 million, with monthly maintenance in the mid-$1,800s.

Mr. Roche knew the Printing House, which had been converted to a condominium building a decade after its conversion to a rental, was undergoing an ambitious renovation. One hundred and four units that had not sold, and which had been used as rentals, were being turned into 60 apartments, and the common areas were being upgraded. Sales began last spring. Only 8 to 10 apartments were on the market at any one time, said the developer, Myles J. Horn. ""We had unanticipated demand,"" he said, ""and we were showing apartments only by appointment, and we were busy all day long."" When the couple finally did visit, they found all of the features they wanted, along with two bonuses: a washer-dryer and an outdoor pool at the Equinox fitness club in the building. They bought a fifth-floor one-bedroom of around 940 square feet for $1.578 million, with monthly charges of just under $1,300. They arrived early this past winter, having sold their old Fifth Avenue place for $1.135 million. (Maintenance there was in the mid-$1,600s.) ""We are kind of lateral-sizing,"" Dr. Roth said. ""Did we want to spend that much? No, but there was no doubt in our minds that we felt it was worth it. If we had another couple million dollars, I'd have it bigger. We would be on the top floor overlooking the river.""",Vicki Baum and Steven Roth wanted an apartment with a contemporary interior.,5f52243a-963a-5961-b402-52b6fffb5f10,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/06/realestate/06HUNT1_SPAN/0406HUNT01-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=438477e70f9ab5e11747784a859858e83a03223641c9d21f1b2fc8053a558a45&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"The Buyers

Movies,'Sea Fever' Review: A Timely but Derivative Contagion Thriller,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/movies/sea-fever-review.html,"Borrowing heavily from movies like ""The Thing"" and ""Alien,"" ""Sea Fever"" doesn't have much that's distinct about it, save for a vivid sense of place. Hardiman (who also wrote the script) imbues her story with strains of Irish folklore and the nitty-gritty of the fishing trade. The saturated visual palette -- all greens and browns and neon blues -- evokes a hint of fantasy, but the director grounds the movie in a kind of spatial realism, carefully deploying the crust and claustrophobia of the ship to atmospheric effect.

Unfortunately, this rigor doesn't extend to the plot. In real life, the most fearsome pathogens are those that defy prediction, but contagion movies work best when the threat abides by some consistent rules that can give structure to the stakes. The monster in ""Sea Fever"" mutates haphazardly to accommodate the story's dramatic shifts: in one scene, it goes swiftly from predatory leech to a benign wisp, batted away easily by the heroine. The film also seems unsure about its own shape, switching indecisively between creature feature, epidemic thriller and environmental drama without articulating any meaty ideas.

Sports,U.F.C.'s Coronavirus Plan Is Careful. Its Enforcement Has Been Spotty.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/sports/coronavirus-ufc.html,"Minutes after defeating Tony Ferguson in the headline fight of U.F.C. 249 on Saturday night, Justin Gaethje stood in the octagon and examined his bloodied hands. Gaethje, a power puncher, was being interviewed by the television analyst Joe Rogan, and he offered some understandable gladiatorial bravado: ""I told my coaches in the back, 'You're not going to like it, but I'm ready to die tonight.'"" But at that moment Gaethje's mind was clearly on his hands, and as Rogan went to shake one, Gaethje instead offered a fist bump. Rogan was having none of it, saying ""I don't care"" as he grabbed the hand. ""All right, corona's way worse, blood won't kill you,"" Gaethje responded with a smile. And so went the biggest sporting event in the United States in nearly two months. The long shadow of the coronavirus pandemic hung over the pay-per-view event, which was billed as an attempt to return mixed martial arts to normalcy -- and to inch the rest of the sporting world in that direction. But as stay-at-home orders swept across the United States, the Ultimate Fighting Championship insisted that it would overcome the forces that had upended virtually all top sporting leagues.

In the week leading up to U.F.C. 249, the promotion company's officials spoke of a 25-page document that laid out extensive health and safety protocols that the organization would follow to ensure a safe event. A review of the guidance in the document -- the U.F.C.'s ""Jacksonville Event Operations Plan,"" a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times -- indicates that U.F.C. officials and fighters routinely deviated from the outlined procedures in the days leading up to U.F.C. 249 and on the night of the pay-per-view event itself.

In a statement on Tuesday, the U.F.C. said the plan ""provides a road map for a prudent, safe, and responsible working environment"" as fighting resumes. It noted that the plan ""is not the sum total of our protocols, which also includes Covid-19 antibody blood tests and antigen tests"" and said the U.F.C. would be ""updating it regularly with key learnings from each event going forward."" The U.F.C. plans to hold two more events this week at VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena, with 11 bouts on each fight card. All three events have been approved by the Florida State Boxing Commission. Donald Muzzi, the chief ringside physician for the commission at U.F.C. 249, did not respond to a request for comment.

That wasn't the only part of the operation's plan that went unheeded at times. The plan prohibits all ""contact-based greetings"" and said that all personnel ""will be required to wear the face masks and gloves in connection with their job functions,"" an edict that Dana White, the U.F.C. president, repeatedly ignored. On Friday after the official weigh-ins, the fighter Ronaldo Souza participated in a stare-down with his opponent, Uriah Hall, and bumped fists with White. Seconds later, the fighter Michelle Waterson hugged White before her stare-down and embrace of her opponent, Carla Esparza.

White believes that holding U.F.C. events can help show that it is safe to end stay-at-home orders and to resume holding public events. That belief, in part, appears to stem from his longtime friendship with President Trump -- who, according to White, was looking at U.F.C. 249 as a blueprint. ""His whole philosophy was: Let's get sports back first, figure out how to do that safely,"" White told TMZ. ""Then let's start figuring out how do you get people back in the office? How do you get people in cubicles? And then, how do you get kids back in school?"" Trump made a surprise appearance during U.F.C. 249 in a recorded greeting, congratulating White and connecting the bouts with the return of more live competition. ""Get the sports leagues back, let's play,"" Trump said. ""You do the social distancing and whatever else you have to do, but we need sports. We want our sports back.""

Most fighters, including Souza, arrived at the U.F.C.'s host hotel in Jacksonville, Fla., on Wednesday and immediately received Covid-19 viral and rapid antibody tests. The viral test used by the U.F.C. takes at least 24 hours to get results, and it was not discovered that Souza had the virus until Friday. Some of the required personnel arrived less than 48 hours before the event began. One judge did not arrive until Friday night, according to two people familiar with the event who spoke on condition of anonymity, meaning that, at best, the result of his viral test could not have been received until the day of the fights.

Also, it is unclear whether everybody inside the arena Saturday night followed the same procedures. Arena employees, Florida State Boxing Commission staff members, antidoping administrators and news media members were present along with U.F.C. personnel. The event operations plan says that it does not take into account arena or commission employees, though it notes that some vendors will have to follow its guidelines. Because of the virus's two-week incubation period, it will not be apparent for a while whether any people who were present Saturday night might have contracted the coronavirus at the event. Major American sports leagues, especially in team sports, are confronting very different circumstances from those encountered by the U.F.C. They have hundreds or thousands of athletes and even more staff members. They play home-and-away schedules in two dozen states, each with different local government mandates. They have 500-page collective bargaining agreements with athletes that restrict the terms that commissioners can unilaterally impose. (U.F.C. fighters are not unionized.)","In violation of the U.F.C.'s written guidance, there were interviews in the octagon, a lack of social distancing and missing masks.",13ec5624-e0c6-5fc7-925d-a645440fc07c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/13/sports/13virus-ufc-1/13virus-ufc-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=528&w=1010&s=a1c5c883a0f3e3fb140fcf1f90077fffd564614af80a43ba423c4f416efbd710&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Justin Gaethje, left, with the television analyst Joe Rogan during a postfight interview at U.F.C. 249 on Saturday.

Opinion,Trump's Thoroughly Modern Masculinity,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/opinion/trump-masculinity-femininity.html,"Remarkably, in these fractious times, President Trump has managed to forge a singular area of consensus among liberals and conservatives, Republicans and Democrats: Nearly everyone seems to agree that he represents a throwback to a vintage version of manhood. After Mr. Trump proclaimed his ""domination"" over coronavirus, saluting Marine One and ripping off his mask, the Fox News host Greg Gutfeld cast the president in cinematic World War II terms -- a tough-as-nails platoon leader who ""put himself on the line"" rather than abandon the troops. ""He didn't hide from the virus,"" Mr. Gutfeld said. ""He was going to walk out there on that battlefield with you."" Senator Kelly Loeffler of Georgia tweeted an altered WrestleMania video in which the president was portrayed as pummeling senseless an opponent with a spiked coronavirus head. ""President Trump won't have to recover from Covid,"" Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida gloated. ""Covid will have to recover from President Trump."" Meanwhile, the putatively liberal news media was conjuring its own version of the boxing ring: with Mr. Trump in one corner as atavistic chest-beater and Joe Biden in the other as evolved exemplar of feminist-sensitized manhood.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden ""evoke different brands of manliness,"" a Washington Post article argued: Mr. Trump channels ""old-fashioned machismo"" -- ""aggressive, physically tough, physically strong, never back down"" (in the words of a gender-equity educator, Jackson Katz) -- while Mr. Biden models what Mr. Katz calls ""a more complex 21st-century version of masculinity,"" defined by ""compassion and empathy and care and a personal narrative of loss."" But what if the one thing people agree on, they're wrong about? What if Mr. Trump's style of bullying and bombast aren't relics of the old manhood, but emblems of a masculinity very much au courant? If that's so, we may be fooling ourselves in declaring that his noxious model is heading for a natural extinction. Mr. Trump's handlers have long packaged him as a leatherneck commander, a la ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" -- the embodiment of a retro virility that American society supposedly once celebrated until feminists torpedoed it. Mr. Gutfeld isn't the first to have reached for World War II metaphors when describing the president: Steve Bannon noted during the 2016 race that Mr. Trump's popularity was ""predicated on that Greatest Generation determination, that grit,"" while paying homage to that era's manhood as ""the guy in the trenches, the guy that had to climb the cliffs"" on D-Day. Others in the inner circle put it differently: ""The era of the 'Pajama Boy' is over,"" Sebastian Gorka, soon to be a White House deputy assistant, gushed in December 2016. ""The alpha males are back.""

Except that the coming alphas would be gun fetishists in Hawaiian shirts, storming state capitols and planning the abduction of a governor they called a ""tyrant bitch."" Greatest Generation, really? How about the opposite? The masculine archetype of the 1930s and '40s was the anonymous common man who proved his chops through communal building, not gunslinging. In a 1932 speech, Franklin Delano Roosevelt declared that ""the man of ruthless force had his place in developing a pioneer country"" but he now endangered the nation. ""The lone wolf, the unethical competitor, the reckless promoter,"" he said, ""whose hand is against every man's, declines to join in achieving an end recognized as being for the public welfare, and threatens to drag the industry back to a state of anarchy."" New Deal America championed a manliness of usefulness, demonstrated through collective service and uncelebrated competence. The '30s ideal of heroic civil servant carried into World War II, and was enshrined in Ernie Pyle's battlefront dispatches valorizing unsung grunts -- ""the mud-rain-frost-and-wind boys."" Pyle disparaged the silk-scarfed ""flyboys,"" whose camera-ready star turns Pyle instinctively distrusted. Of the grunt ethic, Pyle wrote, ""We are all men of new professions, out in some strange night caring for each other."" This service-oriented prototype of manhood -- tending to the needs of others, providing protective support, spurning the spotlight -- was essentially a maternal masculinity, all the purported qualities of motherhood, recoded for the Y chromosome. If anyone in the race is channeling that precept, it's Mr. Biden, who, a day after federal officers tear-gassed peaceful protesters to make way for Mr. Trump's photo-op outside St. John's Church, called the presidency ""a duty of care -- to all of us."" Ernie Pyle would have worn a mask, because it comported with the masculine ethos of his era: shielding others from harm, being enlisted in the country's defense. Mr. Trump could not be more at odds with that ethic. His is a Potemkin patriarchy, the he-man re-engineered for an image-based, sensation-saturated and very modern entertainment economy.

How to characterize this new form of masculinity? In a word: ornamental. Contemporary manliness is increasingly defined by display -- in Mr. Trump's case, a pantomime of aggrieved aggression: the curled lip, the exaggerated snarl. Display permeates his ratings-obsessed presidency. It's why he chose his vice president (he ""looks very good"") and his former defense secretary (""If I'm doing a movie, I'd pick you, general""). The chief executive of Newsmax, Chris Ruddy, noted of his friend Mr. Trump's inclinations, ""It's more about the look and the demeanor and the swagger."" Ornamental manhood is the machismo equivalent of ""I'm not a doctor but I play one on TV."" Or, in the boogaloo movement's version, ""I'm not actually a soldier but I wear camo and walk around downtown with my big gun."" (In Mr. Trump's case, it's ""I'm not a successful builder but I played one on 'The Apprentice.'"") The great shame is not that Mr. Trump brought an anachronistic masculinity into the Oval Office, but that he used the Oval Office to market a very modern brand of compensatory manhood -- with a twist. The hallmarks of contemporary ornamental masculinity -- being valued as the object of the gaze, playing the perpetual child, pedestal-perching and mirror-gazing -- are the very ones that women have, for half a century, struggled to dismantle as belittling, misogynist characterizations of femininity. The preoccupation with popularity, glamour, celebrity, appearance -- what are these qualities but the old consumer face of the Girl? If Mr. Trump is reclaiming a traditional stereotypical sex role, it's one that long belonged to women. Why have so many of the modern-day grunts who mourn the loss of ""old-fashioned"" manhood hitched their wagon to a silk-suited flyboy? Since at least the 1990s, and at full tilt in the era of social media, men have been faced with a quandary: how to define their sex in a culture where visibility, performance and marketability are the currency. You could say that Mr. Trump has, if nothing else, found a way. But he's done so not by defending the Greatest Generation man, but by abandoning him. The gender gap in this election can be simply explained. Most women are turned off by the toxic displays of chest-beating that many male voters -- notably but not exclusively white -- find exciting. That level of ostentatious macho arrived in the Oval Office on a wave of 21st- century male insecurity. We should pay attention to that wave because it's not receding. Women were trapped in their ornamental cage because they were locked out of productive work and economic self-sufficiency -- assets now increasingly denied to men. But if men respond to the frustrations of modern manhood by retooling a shopworn and castoff model of ornamental femininity, then we'll all be in trouble.","The president isn't a throwback to old-school masculinity.

Global Business,Milan Fashion House to Join the Diesel Empire,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/21/business/global/milan-fashion-house-to-join-the-diesel-empire.html,"Mr. Rosso's purchase of a controlling but undisclosed stake in Marni illustrates how Italian companies have realized, rather late in the day, the need to work in groups so they have the financial strength to support growth.

French conglomerates have been quick to add Italian brands to their portfolios. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton took control of Fendi and, more recently, the jewelry and watch maker Bulgari. PPR's brands include Gucci and Bottega Veneta.

Movies,"Review: In 'Saturday Church,' Coming of Age, and Coming Out",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/movies/saturday-church-review.html,"Ulysses, the young protagonist of ""Saturday Church,"" is first seen at the burial of his father, a soldier killed overseas. The New York teen, played by Luka Kain, has delicate features and carries an air of quiet about him. He and his younger brother will now be looked after by both their mother Amara (Margot Bingham) and strict Aunt Rose (Regina Taylor). The latter does not mince words after Ulysses is discovered trying on his mother's shoes. ""If I ever hear of you even looking at women's clothing, I will beat it out of you. You are a man. Start acting like one,"" she says, enunciating each word with controlled rage.

But the boy is in no way conflicted about his sexual orientation -- he's just surrounded by disapproval. As a form of escape, he imagines his life as a musical, and the movie is dotted with song and dance, beginning with a particularly audacious locker-room scene in which Ulysses' jock tormentors turn into backup dancers. For real-life affinity, Ulysses seeks companionship on the pier by Manhattan's Christopher Street, where he is enlisted into Saturday Church, a program for at-risk L.G.B.T.Q. youth. (The program in the movie is based on a real one.)

The film was written and directed by Damon Cardasis, making his feature debut. It is a disarmingly and consistently sensitive movie that remains engaging even when its reach sometimes exceeds its grasp. (A musical number set in what might be the world's tidiest homeless shelter doesn't quite make it.) The wonderful cast brings the story home, and Mr. Kain in particular is a real find.

Global Business,G.M. Goes to Germany to Reaffirm Support for Opel,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/business/global/gm-goes-to-germany-to-reaffirm-support-for-opel.html,"Daniel Akerson, chairman and chief executive of G.M., center, visited Opel headquarters in Russelsheim, Germany, where a piece of the Berlin Wall that will stand in front of the headquarters was unveiled.

RUSSELSHEIM, GERMANY -- As they prepare to meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, top managers of General Motors sought to dispel any doubts about the company's commitment to its unprofitable Opel unit in Europe, reiterating plans to invest billions in new models and break even by the middle of the decade. ""We are more convinced than ever that G.M. must have a strong presence in Europe generally and particularly -- especially -- here in Germany,"" Daniel F. Akerson, the chairman and chief executive of G.M., said Wednesday at the Opel headquarters in Russelsheim, near Frankfurt. Several hundred Opel employees crowded onto balconies overlooking an atrium in the office building where Mr. Akerson and other G.M. executives spoke. The workers applauded after Karl-Thomas Neumann, Opel's fourth chief executive since 2010, vowed that, ""Opel is back!"" G.M. is the fourth-largest automaker in the European Union measured by number of cars sold, including the Chevrolet brand. But Opel, sold under the Vauxhall brand in Britain, has been among the manufacturers hit hardest by a relentless downturn in European auto sales that began in 2011.

Sales of Opel and Vauxhall in Europe fell 16 percent in February from a year earlier, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, while market share slipped to 6.1 percent from 6.4 percent, less than half of what the market leader, Volkswagen, claims. A few months ago some auto executives were predicting that European sales were close to hitting bottom, but there is no sign of a revival yet. Daimler, the German maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, said Wednesday that it might need to reassess its sales forecasts for 2013 because of the prolonged slump in Europe. G.M.'s board of directors held a regularly scheduled meeting Wednesday in Russelsheim, site of a large Opel factory and design center. It was the first time the board had met in Germany for at least two decades, company representatives said. The board's presence was probably intended to help correct the widespread impression among Germans that G.M. regarded Opel as an unwanted stepchild.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions. Mr. Akerson's appearance had the quality of a state visit. He arrived for a press event in Russelsheim with an entourage that included the U.S. ambassador to Germany, Philip D. Murphy, and the prime minister of the state of Hesse, Volker Bouffier. Mr. Akerson will meet Thursday with Ms. Merkel, but neither G.M. nor the chancellor's office has said what is on the agenda. Mr. Akerson repeated a promise to invest EUR4 billion, or $5.2 billion, in Europe through 2016. The money will be used to introduce 23 new models and variants of existing models, as well as 13 new engines.

""Opel is paving the way for the biggest turnaround in the history of the European auto industry,"" Stephen J. Girsky, vice chairman of G.M., said at the event Wednesday. But Opel has yet to prove that the latest turnaround attempt will achieve better results than previous efforts. Opel has not reported a profit since the 1990s. Its employees have suffered waves of job cuts and there is currently a wage freeze in effect at German plants. Opel plans to close down vehicle production at a plant in Bochum, Germany, as early as next year. But Opel appears, at least, to have finally achieved detente with workers after years of strife that helped tarnish the brand's image. Wolfgang Schafer-Klug, chairman of the workers' council at Opel, spoke at the event Wednesday, expressing gratitude for what he said was a clear commitment from G.M. Mr. Bouffier, the state prime minister, noted that many previous turnaround plans failed. ""We have often had hopes that a short time later were disappointed,"" he said at the event. But he expressed optimism that this time could be different. ""No company invests EUR4 billion in such a short time unless it believes in the future,"" Mr. Bouffier said. After the speeches were over, the executives and political leaders moved outdoors where they stood in a stiff wind and revealed a slab of concrete that was once part of the Berlin Wall. The graffiti-covered slab will stand in front of the headquarters to encourage workers to overcome obstacles, Opel said, and as a symbol of the new era that the company hopes lies ahead.","Dan Akerson, the chairman of General Motors, reiterated plans to invest $5.2 billion in the brand despite the sluggish European economy.",d5b23219-a646-5cad-96a7-ca093b174b0a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/04/11/business/global/11opel/11opel-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=432&w=600&s=994755f9e6f470f8898337a2bf4e7f21fc3d4b03ac065ae1fcd4b0b561784362&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Daniel Akerson, chairman and chief executive of G.M., center, visited Opel headquarters in Rüsselsheim, Germany, where a piece of the Berlin Wall that will stand in front of the headquarters was unveiled.",d5b23219-a646-5cad-96a7-ca093b174b0a,N24News/imgs/d5b23219-a646-5cad-96a7-ca093b174b0a.jpg,24
Global Business,"With China's Growth Easing, Premier Calls for Stimulus",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/22/business/global/chinas-premier-open-to-stimulus-steps.html,"HONG KONG -- Premier Wen Jiabao is calling for Chinese economic policies to tilt a little more toward fostering growth, official media reported on Monday, in the latest sign of concern in China about a faltering in the country's economic expansion. Speaking during a weekend trip to Wuhan in south-central China, Mr. Wen mostly endorsed existing policies but also indicated a new willingness to countenance economic stimulus. ""We should continue to implement a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy while giving more priority to maintaining growth,"" Mr. Wen said, according to the official Xinhua news agency. In April, industrial production in China slackened to its slowest growth in nearly two years, fixed-asset investment grew at its weakest pace in nearly a decade and imports practically stopped growing, all signs of eroding confidence in the business environment. But Chinese officials have said before that they would make sure economic growth at least meets their minimum target of 7.5 percent.

Jing Ulrich, the chairwoman of China markets at JPMorgan Chase, said that the comments made it likely that China would reduce two or three more times this year the minimum reserves that banks must set aside as protection, leaving banks with more cash available to lend. ""Premier Wen's comments indicate we are likely to see further monetary easing in the coming months,"" she wrote in an e-mail. Yet Mr. Wen carefully hedged his remarks, endorsing existing policies but not offering new ones. He reaffirmed his signature policy of popping the country's real estate bubble so as to improve the affordability of housing. He even exhorted local authorities to continue tightening real estate regulations. ""We must never allow property controls to suffer a setback, or else our achievements through many years of hard work will come to nothing,"" he said, according to state-run radio.
* Today in On Tech: Imagine not living in Big Tech's world.
* Dollar Tree will raise prices to $1.25 by the end of April. Mr. Wen also strongly hinted that the authorities were not yet worried enough to embark on a repeat of the expansionary monetary policy and heavy lending by state-controlled banks that pulled China out of the global financial crisis three years ago. Extensive bank lending and a 53 percent increase in two years in the broadly measured money supply has left an overhang of inflation and spiraling home prices that China is still trying to quell. Mr. Wen mentioned repeatedly over the weekend the importance of fighting inflation and maintaining prudence in monetary policy decisions.

Mr. Wen also reiterated his support for replacing sales taxes with value-added taxes; urging local governments to find ways to help farmers; and encouraging the country's mostly state-controlled banks to consider lending more to small and medium-sized enterprises, instead of issuing most loans to state-owned enterprises and local government agencies. ""The relationship between maintaining growth, adjusting economic structures and managing inflation must be properly handled,"" Mr. Wen said in a characteristically noncommittal statement. Todd Lee, a senior director for global economics in the Boston office of IHS Global Insight, an international consulting firm, said that Mr. Wen's remarks in Wuhan represented a slight shift in the government's stance toward stimulus, as well as a continuing wariness of igniting another bubble in real estate prices if inflation reappears. ""I think they're signaling they may be a little more aggressive,"" Mr. Lee said. ""They're trying to set this fine balance between maintaining growth and keeping the real estate market under control."" Investors and economists closely scrutinize the comments of Chinese leaders like Mr. Wen because the country's top political figures play a crucial role in setting policy on interest rates, bank lending rules and other economic policies. The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, has no political independence, operating at the direction of the cabinet, which Mr. Wen leads. Investors in mainland China and Hong Kong appeared guarded about the extent to which Mr. Wen's remarks represented a significant shift in policy. The CSI 300 index of A shares on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets rose 0.5 percent on Monday, while the Hong Kong stock market, increasingly dominated by mainland companies, fell 0.2 percent on Monday.","Wen Jiabao called for more growth, though he stopped well short of calling for the vast increase in bank lending and monetary supply that eased the financial crisis three years ago.",1e0874a4-ab35-5ecf-8c3b-f7f20dec07c5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/05/22/business/Yuan/Yuan-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=360&w=600&s=1531863f68dd9813ae061abeb38d93b004f0338daccdb7a9901cc4350929cbba&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"In Beijing, workers at a building site.

Sports,Youth and Experience Will Face Off in the U.S. Open Women's Draw,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/31/sports/tennis/us-open-women.html,"The women's singles draw has been depleted by many absences; six of the top 10 women will not be playing in this year's U.S. Open. Still, with Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka and several other big stars, there are plenty of reasons to watch. Here are just a few of the reasons nobody should dismiss the strength of this year's women's field: Pliskova, the top-seeded woman at this year's U.S. Open, is a remarkably powerful player. For all her strengths, she has yet to secure a Grand Slam title, having lost in her only Grand Slam final at Flushing Meadows in 2016. But anyone who dismisses her for her lack of major success must consider the larger picture. Pliskova has led the Czech Republic to three Fed Cup titles, and in the last four years, she has not lost at the U.S. Open before the round of 16. After defending her title at the Brisbane International earlier this year, Pliskova appears to be poised to build on her hardcourt success in pursuit of her first Grand Slam title. At the Australian Open in February, Kenin, 21, became the youngest American to win a Grand Slam title since Serena Williams won the 2002 U.S. Open at 20. Kenin, the second seed at this year's U.S. Open, has displayed a remarkable amount of craftiness in her game. That is especially true of her backhand, as she seems entirely comfortable with delaying her shotmaking decisions, making it difficult for her opponents to position themselves. Paired with her impressive drop shots, Kenin's backhand can be one of the most effective on the WTA Tour. In Australia, she defeated two Grand Slam champions on her way to the title, and now that she has a major under her belt as well, she is likely to feel even fewer nerves on her way through this year's U.S. Open.

Williams, the third seed at this year's U.S. Open, is tennis royalty. She continues to chase the 24th Grand Slam title to tie Margaret Court's record. Although her last major title came at the 2017 Australian Open, she has reached four Grand Slam finals since then, including those at the last two U.S. Opens. At 38, Williams is viewed by some as past her peak, with even one more title unlikely. But with the power she can still deliver on her groundstrokes and the intelligence with which she constructs points and targets her opponents' weaknesses, there's always the possibility of another championship.

Osaka, the fourth seed, was the U.S. Open champion in 2018 and followed that up by winning the Australian Open five months later. She has struggled to replicate her form at Grand Slams since then, but after her father returned as her coach after the 2019 U.S. Open, she won titles in Osaka and Beijing. Her performances there were a glimmer of the Osaka fans had become used to and pointed to something critical: While the physical aspects of her game seem unimpeachable, Osaka has spoken about the need to work on her mental game. Unforced errors can sink her on bad days, especially as her style often leads her into long rallies. On Saturday, Osaka pulled out of the Western & Southern Open final, citing a pulled hamstring. This is a cause for some concern heading into the U.S. Open, but Osaka's high level of play should shine through. Sabalenka's best performance at a Grand Slam was a round of 16 finish at the U.S. Open in 2018, but the 22-year-old Belarusian has shown strengths and consistency elsewhere. She won three tournaments in 2019 and won the championship at the Doha Open early in 2020. With her U.S. Open doubles title last year, she is a young player who appears to be primed for further victories. Her aggressive style of play allows her to dictate points but can also lead to unforced errors. While that generally works in her favor on fast-paced hardcourts, it can hurt her chances in the long, grinding two-week format of a Grand Slam. Kvitova, the world No. 12, has won Wimbledon twice, along with six Fed Cup titles, a feat bested only by Chris Evert and Billie Jean King. An attack during a home invasion at the end of 2016 left her dominant left hand severely injured. That did not stop Kvitova, who returned five months later to play at the 2017 French Open. She was a 2019 Australian Open finalist, losing to Naomi Osaka in three very close sets. Aside from the natural advantages ascribed to left-handers, Kvitova has serving power and placement that make it difficult to break her service game. She has also been focusing on her court movement, a perennial weakness in her game. With those improvements, she is a considerable threat on the fast-paced hardcourts of Flushing Meadows.

Keys, the world No. 13, has reached just one Grand Slam final, at the U.S. Open in 2017, which she lost to a fellow American, Sloane Stephens. However, in the last five years, she has not been knocked out of the U.S. Open before the round of 16. Keys's powerful serve and forehand are her main weapons, with the pace she generates often compared to Serena Williams's. After she reached the finals in Brisbane, it would not be a surprise if Keys kept her streak going and had another deep run at this year's U.S. Open. At 29, Martic, the world No. 14, is at the peak of her career. She won her first WTA title in 2019 at the Istanbul Cup and reached her first Grand Slam quarterfinal at the 2019 French Open. Her well-rounded game is generally better suited to clay, but she reached the round of 16 at last year's U.S. Open, losing to Serena Williams. It would not be a surprise to see her there again.

Konta, a quarterfinalist at last year's U.S. Open, has challenged for a number of titles and has fallen just a bit short. She has been a semifinalist at the three other Grand Slams, including the 2019 French Open. The main criticism she has faced is that she does not have a coherent Plan B. But hitting angled, flat shots from the baseline the way she can, she might not need one. It seems just a matter of time before she has a chance to play in a Grand Slam final. Muguruza, a two-time Grand Slam champion, has a history of struggling at the U.S. Open. Until this year, the same thing could have been said for her performance at the Australian Open. But she stormed to the final, past highly ranked players including Simona Halep and Elina Svitolina, before losing to Kenin in the final. Aside from the strengths in her game, the mental boost of success on a similar surface could help her overcome her struggles in Flushing. A few more players to watch: In January, Ons Jabeur became the first Arab woman to reach the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam tournament. Jabeur's varied, entertaining style of tennis will be just one of the reasons to keep an eye on her as the tournament progresses.","The No. 1 and No. 2 players are absent, but Serena Williams continues her quest for a record title, while Sofia Kenin and Naomi Osaka are at her heels.",81467ba6-8994-53ed-8a12-4e1f427573fa,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/31/sports/31USOpenWomen-1/merlin_176092497_f47c8c20-152a-4a1e-85fc-b3535cdd27a1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=03261ca1b76c0e66fed48780f7e2612b7b2c55ed12fa313d5b7011e73ab7297a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Karolina Pliskova of the Czech Republic, the No. 1 women's seed, is looking for her first Grand Slam title.",81467ba6-8994-53ed-8a12-4e1f427573fa,N24News/imgs/81467ba6-8994-53ed-8a12-4e1f427573fa.jpg,9
Science,Hummingbirds Navigate an Ultraviolet World We Never See,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/science/hummingbirds-color-vision.html,"Hummingbirds were already impressive. They move like hurried insects, turn on aerial dimes and extract nectar from flowers with almost surgical precision. But they conceal another talent, too: seeing colors that human eyes can't perceive.

Ultraviolet light from the sun creates colors throughout the natural world that are never seen by people. But researchers working out of the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory reported on Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that untrained broad-tailed hummingbirds can use these colors to help them identify sources of food.

Testing 19 pairings of colors, the team found that hummingbirds are picking up on multiple colors beyond those we can see. From the bird's-eye view, numerous plants and feathers have these as well, suggesting that they live in a richer-hued world than we do, full of signs and messages that we never notice.

Compared with the color vision of many other animals, that of humans leaves something to be desired. The perception of color relies on cone cells in the retina, each of which responds to different wavelengths of light. Humans have three kinds of cone cells, which, when light reflects off an apple, a leaf or a field of daffodils, send signals that are combined in the brain to generate the perception of red, green or yellow. Birds, however, have four types of cones, including one that is sensitive to ultraviolet light. (And they are far from the most generously endowed -- mantis shrimp, for instance, have 16.)",New research shows that the nectar-drinking birds use their enhanced color vision to distinguish sources of food.,60c28720-7b4f-5429-b9d2-a3fa06b12d76,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/07/science/19OBS-HUMMINGBIRD/19TB-HUMMINGBIRD-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=7abd5d03b06b75776f95407d3bdbcfb97537e7277b4e266547fe00015887a04f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A broad-tailed hummingbird near Gothic, Colo., seeing colors you wouldn&rsquo;t believe.",60c28720-7b4f-5429-b9d2-a3fa06b12d76,N24News/imgs/60c28720-7b4f-5429-b9d2-a3fa06b12d76.jpg,2

Opinion,Kicked From the Curb in Alabama,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/28/opinion/supreme-court-alabama-voting-disability.html,"Last week, the Supreme Court acquiesced to another attack on the voting rights of all Americans. In a 5-3 decision, the court blocked a trial judge's ruling permitting Alabama counties to offer curbside voting as a reasonable accommodation to disabled voters. People with disabilities represent over 95 percent of Covid-related deaths in Alabama. Now, they must risk their lives in order to exercise their constitutional rights. Howard Porter Jr. a Black plaintiff with asthma and Parkinson's disease, testified in the case that many of his ancestors died to vote, but ""while I don't mind dying to vote, I think we're past that -- we're past that time."" Unfortunately, the Supreme Court disagreed -- and with the arrival of Amy Coney Barrett, will likely continue to do so. But even in defeat, Merrill v. People First of Alabama highlights an important truth: Disability rights laws offer a powerful tool to advance civil rights for all Americans. Alabama's ban on curbside voting was challenged by People First of Alabama, an advocacy organization run by people with developmental disabilities, using the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act. People First was represented by civil rights groups like the N.A.A.C.P. and the Southern Poverty Law Center, and its challenge to to the voting restrictions was noteworthy not only because it sought to protect the rights of disabled Alabamians, but because it used a disability rights law to fight a restriction designed to suppress the turnout of Black voters.

This is not unprecedented. Disability rights law offers a valuable set of tools for civil rights advocacy of all kinds. Because the ADA requires reasonable accommodations and modifications to enable accessibility, people with disabilities can seek changes to generally applicable policies that are much harder to challenge through other statutes. And because disability is more prevalent among racial and ethnic minorities, disability rights statutes can be applied to a broad range of civil rights problems. Recent litigation challenging the Trump administration's ""public charge"" rule, restricting the entry and naturalization of immigrants likely to use social-welfare programs, makes use of disability rights law to protect immigrants. Because the administration sought to penalize immigrants for making use of public services disproportionately or primarily relied upon by people with disabilities, the door was opened for disability and immigration activists to work together in support of a common goal. Nor is the A.D.A. the only disability rights law that offers a useful vehicle for advancing racial justice. During the Obama administration, the Department of Education sought to combat the segregation of minority children into special education classrooms by leveraging the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Though the Trump administration tried to roll back these protections, the courts soon restored them. Now, disability rights and racial justice advocacy groups are working together to establish new protections against restraint and seclusion, disproportionately deployed against students of color and students with disabilities. These groups also target school resource officers, who often send students from both groups down the school-to-prison pipeline. Disability rights law can also be a useful instrument for tackling our country's serious criminal justice problem. People with disabilities, especially people of color with disabilities, are disproportionately likely to be incarcerated and shot by the police. Civil liberties groups have made use of the A.D.A. to try to force law enforcement to change their practices.

Mental illness is often a factor in bringing people into contact with the criminal justice system. Because of this, disability groups are exploring using the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Olmstead v. L.C., which ruled that unjustified institutionalization of people with disabilities is a form of discrimination, to press states to invest in community services to help people with mental illness avoid the prison system. Advocates in California recently brought suit against Alameda County on this basis, seeking to use Olmstead to keep adults with mental illness, especially Black adults, from incarceration and institutionalization. While some seek to turn back the clock to the days of mass institutionalization and easy involuntary commitment, Olmstead and the A.D.A. offer a more useful avenue for tackling criminal justice involvement of people with mental illness, including the people of color who our legal system most marginalizes. In the coming years, the A.D.A. may prove itself a valuable weapon in the fight against mass incarceration. Of course, disability rights laws are not new, and neither are the problems they are being deployed to address. So why is such cross-movement collaboration a relatively recent occurrence? Historically, a disproportionately white disability rights movement has shied away from work on racial justice, preferring the relatively bipartisan support most disability issues once enjoyed. Doing so was a mistake. Disability rights cannot thrive without the broader democratic rights now under attack. More important, disability organizations should not exclude disabled people of color from the constituencies they hold themselves accountable to. At the same time, many traditional civil rights groups are unfamiliar with disability issues. In some circles, disability is still seen as only an outcome of disparities and injustice, not a factor causing them. Fortunately, a growing number of civil rights organizations are considering how to better meet the needs of their disabled constituents. Awareness that disability rights offers powerful tools to address voting rights, school desegregation and criminal justice reform, among other civil rights concerns, has helped accelerate the transition. There is a growing recognition that disability prejudice and racial prejudice interact and often reinforce each other. Addressing either requires confronting both. As the disability and civil rights movements realize how much they have to offer each other, old divides are beginning to narrow. Decisions like Merrill v. People First are disheartening attacks on the democratic rights of disabled and minority voters -- but they also illustrate the value of seeing our civil rights laws as part of a larger whole, capable of complementing and supporting each other to become something more than the sum of their parts.

The future of our country's judiciary is more in doubt than ever -- but it looks increasingly likely that all of our civil rights laws will rise or fall together. In her powerful dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor not only offered an eloquent defense of the basic principles of disability rights law, she also set the stage for further collaboration between disability rights and racial justice activists. In the years to come, we will continue to discover we are more powerful together than apart. Ari Ne'eman, a visiting scholar at the Lurie Institute for Disability Policy at Brandeis University and a doctoral student in health policy at Harvard, is at work on a book on the history of American disability advocacy.

Technology,Jeff Bezos Accuses National Enquirer of 'Extortion and Blackmail',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/technology/jeff-bezos-sanchez-enquirer.html,"The richest man on earth accused the nation's leading supermarket tabloid publisher of ""extortion and blackmail"" on Thursday, laying out a theory that brought together international intrigue, White House politics, nude photos and amorous text messages. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the owner of The Washington Post, made his accusations against American Media Inc., the company behind The National Enquirer, in a lengthy post on the online platform Medium. Last month, The Enquirer published an expose of Mr. Bezos' extramarital affair with Lauren Sanchez, a former host of the Fox show ""So You Think You Can Dance."" The headline of Mr. Bezos' post -- ""No thank you, Mr. Pecker"" -- targeted David J. Pecker, the head of the tabloid company. In the sometimes digressive text that followed, he accused American Media of threatening to publish graphic photographs of Mr. Bezos, including a ""below-the-belt selfie,"" if he did not publicly affirm that The Enquirer's reporting on his affair was not motivated by political concerns. ""Well, that got my attention,"" Mr. Bezos wrote of the threat. ""But not in the way they likely hoped.""

The inciting event in this battle of American titans was the Jan. 28 edition of The Enquirer, which hit supermarket racks on Jan. 10, one day after Mr. Bezos and his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie, announced that they would be getting a divorce. The tabloid devoted 11 pages to the story of Mr. Bezos' affair with Ms. Sanchez, calling it ""the biggest investigation in Enquirer history!"" [Who Is MacKenzie Bezos? Her divorce has made the novelist, and her private life, a public fascination.] The Enquirer boasted that it had tracked the couple ""across five states and 40,000 miles,"" furtively observing them as they boarded private jets, rode in limousines and repaired to ""five-star hotel hideaways."" The article was illustrated with paparazzi shots of the unwitting couple as they stepped onto a tarmac and arrived together at what the tabloid called ""their beachfront love nest in Santa Monica."" The tabloid also published amorous text messages that Mr. Bezos had sent to Ms. Sanchez. ""I am crazy about you,"" he wrote, according to The Enquirer. ""All of you."" Tech executives are not the usual subjects of Enquirer covers, and the story set off speculation in Washington and New York media circles that the tabloid's aggressive coverage of Mr. Bezos was tied to the closeness of Mr. Pecker, The Enquirer's chief, and the White House. That alliance came fully to light last year in the legal drama involving hush payments to women alleging affairs with Mr. Trump.

[Our media columnist examined the unlikely power of The National Enquirer in December.] Mr. Trump and Mr. Pecker were longtime friends -- but the relationship between the two was said to be frayed in recent months, when American Media's leadership entered into a deal with federal prosecutors looking into the company's role in the hush payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Pecker and his associates had helped orchestrate the deals involving two women who alleged past affairs with Mr. Trump in ""catch and kill"" deals: the former Playboy model Karen McDougal and the porn star Stormy Daniels. After The Enquirer made his private life public, giving Twitter wags and late-night hosts the chance to weigh in on his high-flown texting style, Mr. Bezos sprang into action, starting his own investigation of the tabloid's motives and how it had come to possess his texts to Ms. Sanchez. The Amazon founder, who at last count was worth $136 billion, suggested that he would spare no expense in taking the fight to the tabloid publisher. Leading the investigation was Gavin de Becker, Mr. Bezos' longtime security chief, whom Mr. Bezos said he had instructed ""to proceed with whatever budget he needed to pursue the facts in this matter."" It was a bold move for someone who has often tried to evade the spotlight, even amid the frequent insults hurled his way by Mr. Trump, who has labeled the newspaper that Mr. Bezos purchased in 2013 as ""The Amazon Post"" and recently called him ""Jeff Bozo"" in a tweet. [Mr. de Becker has advised celebrities on threats for decades.] Mr. de Becker confirmed to The Daily Beast on Jan. 31 that he was leading the investigation into the matter of how the Enquirer had obtained the text messages. Not long afterward, The Post prepared an article exploring competing theories about the motivation behind the publication of the tawdry tale. American Media made the next move, offering Mr. Bezos an offer that it wrongly assumed he could not refuse. And if he did say no? A future issue of The Enquirer would make him very unhappy, with the selfies and more of the steamy texts it had apparently obtained. ""Of course I don't want personal photos published, but I also won't participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks and corruption,"" Mr. Bezos wrote. ""I prefer to stand up, roll this log over and see what crawls out.""

On Friday morning, the company said in a statement that although it stood by its actions, for now, its board was starting an investigation into the matter. ""American Media believes fervently that it acted lawfully in the reporting of the story of Mr. Bezos,"" the statement said. ""Nonetheless, in light of the nature of the allegations published by Mr. Bezos, the Board has convened and determined that it should promptly and thoroughly investigate the claims. Upon completion of that investigation, the Board will take whatever appropriate action is necessary."" The statement was certain to intensify speculation around the future of Mr. Pecker and his top news executive, Dylan Howard. But American Media is privately held, and its board has been steadfast in its loyalty to Mr. Pecker through the most tumultuous year of his tenure with the company. The board made no statements and took no action to investigate American Media's role in acting as an arm of Mr. Trump's campaign, even after the company signed a non-prosecution agreement with the authorities. The board consists of two partners from Chatham Asset Management, a financial backer of the company, and David R. Hughes, the former chief financial officer of Trump Entertainment Resorts.

By using Medium to reveal The Enquirer's backstage maneuvers, Mr. Bezos -- one of the world's most powerful tech titans and the owner of one of the country's most influential newspapers -- showed the best means of communications can be a simple blog post. Sometimes rambling -- while also showing the occasional flair of tabloid columnists of yore -- the Bezos post pulled together random strands of the yearlong legal drama involving the president, American Media and the allegedly illegal payments to women. That federal inquiry resulted in a guilty plea from Mr. Trump's former attorney and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, who said he had paid Ms. Daniels $130,000 and asked American Media to pay Ms. McDougal $150,000 at the president's direction, to protect his election prospects. Federal prosecutors with the Southern District of New York determined that the American Media payment was an illegal corporate contribution. Because the company cooperated with prosecutors, the authorities did not bring charges. But they made American Media sign onto a non-prosecution agreement, in which it affirmed that it had made the payment to ""influence the election."" That agreement, signed in September, stipulated that A.M.I. ""shall commit no crimes whatsoever"" for three years, and that if it did, ""A.M.I. shall thereafter be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation of which this office has knowledge."" If American Media's threat to publish the personal photos of Mr. Bezos is determined to have been criminal, it would find its deal with federal prosecutors in jeopardy. ""One thing we can be certain of is these allegations will be looked at hard by the federal prosecutors,"" said Jeff Tsai, a former federal prosecutor. ""The nature of that non-prosecution agreement -- to not commit any crimes -- was to give A.M.I. the opportunity to really think hard about the nature of its practices.""

He added, ""You can sometimes get a pass from federal prosecutors; it's much harder to get two passes."" The agreement put American Media, Mr. Pecker and Mr. Howard at odds with Mr. Trump, which served to tamp down speculation that the Enquirer had somehow pursued the Bezos story in alliance with the president and his allies. On Feb. 5, though, that possibility surfaced in The Post. Mr. de Becker told the paper that the Enquirer story had begun with a ""politically motivated'' leak. Mr. de Becker has served as a protector to Olivia Newton-John, Michael J. Fox and friends and family of Ronald Reagan. He declined to comment. American Media appeared to warn Mr. Bezos away from raising any political speculation in an email to Mr. de Becker's attorney, which he shared on Medium. In the letter, which he quoted in full, a lawyer for the company, Jon Fine, demanded that Mr. Bezos state publicly that he had ""no knowledge or basis for suggesting that"" American Media's ""coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces."" Mr. Fine has worked as a lawyer at Amazon. In his post Mr. Bezos also appeared to imply that the tabloid company was doing the bidding of Saudi Arabia, quoting from a New York Times report last year: ""After Mr. Trump became president, he rewarded Mr. Pecker's loyalty with a White House dinner to which the media executive brought a guest with important ties to the royals in Saudi Arabia. At the time, Mr. Pecker was pursuing business there while also hunting for financing for acquisitions."" The Post has been reporting determinedly on intelligence assessments that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, ordered the grisly murder of the Saudi dissident -- and Post global opinion contributor -- Jamal Khashoggi.","In an online post, the chief executive of Amazon said the tabloid's owner had used ""extortion and blackmail"" to try to stop his investigation into leaked photos and text messages.",6fb84751-d8d1-522e-b070-5ac9e9be2a53,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/08/business/08bezos01/08bezos01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=cb82ea0c98d26caaecb90e256ad15a57e9ff5161cdc938f3f3aba0297d1e65d4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, said Thursday that the owner of The National Enquirer had tried to stop his investigation into how his private text messages and photos were leaked to the tabloid.",6fb84751-d8d1-522e-b070-5ac9e9be2a53,N24News/imgs/6fb84751-d8d1-522e-b070-5ac9e9be2a53.jpg,20
Your Money,What You Need to Know About Safe Deposit Boxes,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/your-money/banking-safe-deposit-boxes.html,"As personal banking goes digital, safe deposit boxes may seem a relic from the analog age. Yet some people still want the security of storage away from home for valuables, important papers and sentimental keepsakes, financial advisers say. A safe deposit box is a locked storage bin, usually in a vault or secure area, that banks and credit unions rent. Typically, customers receive a key, and must check in with a bank employee, who uses a second ""guard"" key in tandem with the customer's key, to unlock the box. Some banks may offer keyless systems that allow access by scanning a finger or a hand. Federal regulators and industry groups said they don't have statistics on the use or availability of safe deposit boxes, but some banks and financial advisers said demand has been slack. A Bank of America spokeswoman, Betty Riess, said demand for the boxes has dropped ""significantly,"" particularly among younger customers who prefer digital storage of documents. Fewer than half of its safe deposit boxes are rented, she said. Elyse Foster, a financial planner in Boulder, Colo., said that when she contacted several banks on behalf of a client to ask if they offered safe deposit boxes, ""I kept getting 'no' answers."" Ms. Foster said she was told that the boxes took up too much space and that demand had fallen in favor of home safes.

But Elizabeth Seymour, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase, said that while she did not have historical data available, Chase currently has safe deposit boxes in more than half of its branches and that they are still popular with customers. David McGuinn, a safe deposit box consultant in Houston, said there were still millions of boxes rented and plenty of branches offering them. He said he considered them ""the safest place to store anything you consider valuable."" So what should you keep in one? The bank boxes are best for storing documents and valuables that you usually don't need on short notice. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation says ""good candidates"" include originals of birth certificates, property deeds, car titles as well as paper United States savings bonds that haven't been converted into electronic versions (availability of paper savings bonds is limited these days). If you travel often or on short notice, keeping a passport in a safe deposit box may be inconvenient, since you can access the safe deposit box only during regular bank hours. A home safe may be a better choice. The Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, tested and recommended fireproof home safes. Estate lawyers generally frown on keeping wills in safe deposit boxes in case access to the box is restricted after the owner's death. That may cause delays in retrieving the will. ""When a person dies, you may not be able to get to it,"" said T. Randolph Harris, a lawyer specializing in estate and trust planning at McLaughlin & Stern in New York. He advises clients to keep the original will with their lawyer, and to keep a copy at home in a secure place like a locked file cabinet.

Storing emergency cash in a safe deposit box is also unwise, advisers say. Unlike money in a deposit account, cash in a safe deposit box isn't insured by the F.D.I.C., and it may be vulnerable to theft. This year, the Federal Reserve Board took punitive action against a former bank employee who stole $30,000 in cash from a customer's safe deposit box. Banks aren't immune to risks from natural disasters. So it's best to seal documents or other items that may be damaged by flood in plastic bags or containers to help protect them from water damage, Mr. McGuinn said. Paula Pierce, a lawyer in Austin, Tex., urged consumers to carefully read the contract for their safe deposit box, which outlines what happens if, for instance, you lose your key. The American Bankers Association said banks don't keep copies of your key, so if you lose yours, the lock must be replaced. Often, Ms. Pierce said, ""there's a hefty charge for getting the box rekeyed,"" so keep it in a safe place. Also, be sure to keep current on rental fees, Ms. Pierce said. Details vary by state, she said, but generally, after a period of notice, the bank may be allowed to sell the contents of the box to pay delinquent fees. Any excess money is turned over to the state as unclaimed property. David J. O'Brien, a fee-only financial planner in Midlothian, Va., said he encouraged clients to take an inventory and to visit the box periodically to verify its contents. He said a relative's safe deposit box was mistakenly drilled open and emptied by her bank, which had confused it with another box with a similar number whose owner had fallen delinquent on rental fees. The box's contents -- including a watch with sentimental value -- were eventually recovered, he said. But the incident suggests that letting items languish indefinitely is a mistake. ""You need to catalog what's in it,"" he said, ""and then check on it."" Here are some questions and answers about safe deposit boxes: How much does a safe deposit box typically cost? Fees vary depending by location and the size of the box, and may range from $20 to about $200 a year. Customers with certain accounts may get a discount. Are valuable items in my safe deposit box covered by insurance? Not usually. The bank generally doesn't insure the contents of the box. So if you are storing jewelry or other valuables you should buy insurance separately, said Lynne McChristian, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute. Typically, you would have the item appraised, then ""schedule"" coverage for its replacement value on your homeowner's policy. Insurers often charge less to insure an item, she said, if it is kept in a safe deposit box. Is the fee for my safe deposit box tax deductible? Not any more, said Lewis Altfest, chief executive of Altfest Personal Wealth Management in New York. Such fees previously could be taken as a miscellaneous deduction, in some cases, on your federal tax return, but the deduction was suspended as part of last year's tax overhaul.","More bank customers are going digital. Still, safe deposit boxes are good for documents and valuables that you usually don't need on short notice.",4c218fb5-d168-59ad-b526-783544c2b880,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/18/business/18ADVISER/19ADVISER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=ec7b8a80fafbaa03c9490d6620748bd2a7663cab1c4e007210fcd8f7d95a2ce9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Safety deposit boxes at the Pizza Vault in Lake Tomahawk, Wis., which was once a bank branch.",4c218fb5-d168-59ad-b526-783544c2b880,N24News/imgs/4c218fb5-d168-59ad-b526-783544c2b880.jpg,21
Technology,"Amazon Wants You to Wake Up With Alexa, and That's Just the Start",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/technology/amazon-echo-alexa.html,"SEATTLE -- Amazon released the first Echo smart speaker three years ago, not long after the company's attempt at a smartphone proved to be a humiliating failure.

So far, the results for the Echo have been anything but humiliating. Now, having grown more confident that it understands the fickle market for consumer products, Amazon is making it clear that the Echo and other hardware powered by Alexa, the intelligent assistant behind the devices, present the company with one of its brightest opportunities.

On Wednesday, Amazon introduced an array of new Alexa devices that are smaller, less expensive and, in some cases, built for specific areas of the home, including an alarm clock, Echo Spot, that is designed to sit on night stands and desks.

Amazon prides itself on its almost pathological focus on what its customers want, rather than what its competitors are doing. But its new Alexa products are clearly a response, at least in part, to new smart speaker offerings from Google and Apple. Amazon is betting that it can defend its franchise by using an old trick -- aggressive pricing -- and by finding ways to embed Alexa's hooks more deeply into customers' lives.","The company introduced a wide collection of new Echo devices that are smaller, cheaper and, in some cases, built for specific areas of the home.",67d82354-3e58-5fc2-b011-35d35de557c9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/28/business/28AMAZON1/28AMAZON1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=8b21264cff91863aa267de9a975dd9ee307d9c488c8f3527d1c924e73315d6bd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"David Limp, Amazon's senior vice president for devices and services, introduced the new Echo products at the Amazon offices in Seattle.",67d82354-3e58-5fc2-b011-35d35de557c9,N24News/imgs/67d82354-3e58-5fc2-b011-35d35de557c9.jpg,20
Opinion,"Women, Please Speak Out",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/opinion/letters/letters-editor-nytimes-gender.html,"There were consistent patterns: Politics, the economy and foreign affairs? The majority of submissions come from men. (Women represented just over a third of the published letters about politics.) Parenting, health, education and relationships? A larger percentage from women. (For more details about published letters, see below.**)

Interestingly, entries to our high school letter-writing contest last year were disproportionately from girls and young women, as reflected in our published responses. And when we asked readers to name the book that most influenced their lives, a significant majority of both submitted and published letters were from women.

Some of the results surprised us: Homages to stick-shift cars? We published letters from five women, and none from men. And we published a plea from 33 writers, all of them women, to stop using the term ""quid pro quo"" in the impeachment inquiry, in favor of the more explicit ""bribery"" or ""extortion.""

Over all, though, we're not satisfied yet. While there was a small uptick in letters from women right after we announced the project, we still sometimes find ourselves struggling to ensure that women's voices are heard on a wide variety of topics.

At the project's one-year mark, we're reaffirming our commitment to working to reach gender parity. But what was reinforced by this project is that our letters pages are richer for this new collection of voices -- and it compels us to broaden our efforts further, to ensure that we are publishing a range of letters from an even more diverse pool of writers going forward.",A year ago we committed to work toward a goal of parity for women on the letters page.

Opinion,Joe Biden Had Better Watch It,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/31/opinion/joe-biden-trump-2020.html,"Bret Stephens: Hi, Gail. I'm dying to hear your take on the Republican convention. Mine in a nutshell: Joe Biden had better watch out. Gail Collins: OK, open the nutshell -- what should Biden be quivering over? Donald Trump's seating arrangement for his speech? (Loved that squished-together audience.) Or Mike Pence's rhetorical genius? Bret: I need to be careful with the analogy here, so take this as a purely tactical comment. But I fear the Biden campaign has built its Maginot Line along the character-decency-goodness front, while the Trump campaign has launched its, er, Blitzkrieg against Biden's left flank, aiming at the strategic Belgian town of (checks map) Kenosha. Gail: Famous, in happier days, for its Cheese Castle. This is the really sad part of the election year craziness. Kenosha's people don't want more trouble -- and the same is true of Portland. But at times when everybody's angry and twitchy, you need a well-run police department and an absence of political jerks who want to look like tough guys for their campaign.

As Joe Biden says, the job of the president is to lower the temperature. As the convention demonstrated, all Trump wants to do is raise it. Bret: More broadly, the convention helped Trump politically in a bunch of ways. It did what every demagogic party needs to do: create a far-enemy, China, and a near-enemy, the radical left. It painted Biden as an enabler of both. It gave voters something visceral to fear: a progressive mob coming for your suburb, your job and your right to speak your mind. It painted Trump as a straight shooter whose coarseness was courage and whose rudeness was honesty. It gave shy Trump voters moral cover with its long list of Black speakers. And it promised economic growth as opposed to moral restoration. I get that much of this is very distant from the truth. But Trump is now playing offense, and Biden needs a better counterattack than deploying a platoon of fact checkers. Gail: Conventions don't generally move the needle themselves -- not over the long run. And if the target was undecided voters, I'll bet there were at least 12 watching at home. Bret: Not sure if I agree that there aren't a lot of undecideds, but go on. Gail: But if your worry is about Biden needing a more focused, aggressive campaign, you're right. I'm hoping we'll see that soon. Very soon. Cannot be overly soon.

Bret: The Democratic convention succeeded in uniting the party behind Biden. The Bernie Folk aren't going to be sitting this election out, much less voting third party. Now Biden has to counterpunch. He must say that the first order of business in restoring ""law and order"" is to get rid of the most lawless, disorderly and disordered president in American history. He has to give a stirring pro-police speech to some police union, akin to his speech this weekend to the National Guard, stressing the unity of every blue-collar worker. Gail: The police unions are going to be tough. I was so depressed when the head of New York City's P.B.A. showed up as a Republican convention speaker. Bret: Biden has to take on the allegation that he's mentally feeble by challenging Trump to additional debates. He has to say about Trump what Mary McCarthy once said about Lillian Hellman: that every word he says is a lie, including ""and"" and ""the."" He has to mock a ""people's president"" who stiffs his suppliers, scams his students and is currently swindling the American people. He needs to challenge Trump to a new kind of push-up contest: Do a push-up, show a year of tax returns. Bret: And he has to get out in front of people, lots of them. The Biden campaign needs to figure out the public rally equivalent of safe sex: exciting, energetic, passionate, frictional -- but virus-free. Gail: I kinda think three debates plus one for the vice-presidential candidates is enough. More than that and they just become gaffe-traps. The only public takeaway is who said or did something stupid. With these two guys I don't think we need to go the extra mile just for a blooper or two. But you're right that Biden has to run an aggressive campaign that goes way beyond reminding people he's nicer than Trump. And he needs a few resounding messages.

Bret: The Supreme Court, for starters. A second Trump term almost certainly means a third (Ruth Bader Ginsburg), fourth (Stephen Breyer) and possibly fifth (Clarence Thomas) Trump pick. Roe v. Wade doesn't survive on that court. If I were Biden, I'd ask Kamala Harris to go on a swing through Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Hampshire and Wisconsin to explain that if Trump wins, legal abortion will become a thing of the past for every woman living in a red state. Gail: Trump talks about his judicial appointments as one of his greatest accomplishments. That's all thanks to Mitch McConnell, who refused to take up many of Barack Obama's nominees from his first day as majority leader. I know that's kind of inside baseball, but I wish there'd be a way to portray the president as McConnell's Minion. Bret: A second is ethics. Has the swamp ever been swampier than under Trump? Who elected Ivanka to rule over us? How did Jared get to lord it over us? Who turned the White House into a stage prop? Since when does the president use his office to blackmail foreign leaders into doing him political favors? Why is it that nearly everyone who has ever worked for Trump, people like John Bolton and John Kelly, finds him despicable? And did he get somebody to take his S.A.T.s for him? Biden should run a five-minute online spot titled ""A Cheater From the Beginning."" Highlights would include bone spurs, (alleged!) cheating on the S.A.T.s and Marla Maples. Gail: OK, I love that one. Bret: Third issue: Dictator suck-up. No president in history has ever had nicer things to say about America's enemies than Trump, just as no president has ever had nastier things to say about America's friends. I also can imagine the imagery for this: Trump at Helsinki with Vladimir Putin, Trump at Panmunjom with Kim Jong-un, Trump in Osaka with Xi Jinping, Trump in the White House with Recep Tayyip Erdogan. What about you? What are your three? Gail: First, the pandemic. Biden should remind people constantly that when he was vice-president there was an office of the federal government devoted to preventing this exact kind of crisis, and that Trump dismantled it. Bret: Agree. And that he spent weeks pretending the virus would just disappear like morning dew. Gail: Which would lead into my No. 2 issue: health care. Trump may deny it, but his assaults on Obamacare have put coverage of pre-existing conditions in jeopardy. Biden actually wants to give people more insurance options, earlier access to Medicare and address the cost of prescription drugs, which Trump also likes to talk about.","After Trump's unconventional convention, there is danger for the former vice president all over the political landscape.",38fdc89e-9c54-551a-a8a9-251319c1c6b4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/31/opinion/31Conversation/merlin_176269311_f835bf2c-8191-4d0e-85c5-b3a87e613f2d-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=0ac4dafccab01a0473b8ea139ba428600dd610f6eebee2713279c633cabeb5dc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,President Trump and Melania Trump at the White House during the last night of the Republican National Convention on Thursday.,38fdc89e-9c54-551a-a8a9-251319c1c6b4,N24News/imgs/38fdc89e-9c54-551a-a8a9-251319c1c6b4.jpg,11
Books,A Novel Based on the True Story of a Con Man and His Ghostwriter,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/books/review/first-person-richard-flanagan.html,"We live in unsettling times. This isn't news -- both the mainstream media outlets and their alt-news adversaries agree on this point, even if they disagree about what, exactly, has gone wrong. As unnerving as the last few American decades have been, it feels as if the last couple of years have been quantifiably different from what came before, and that the wall that once separated reality from fiction has been beaten into a pile of stones. 's new novel approaches this shift in the zeitgeist by taking us back to the early '90s and focusing on a time when out-and-out liars could still surprise us, when arguments were about interpretation rather than facts themselves; a time when the denial of objective reality could still frighten. It's a time Flanagan knows well, because the story he tells is his. ""First Person"" takes as its inspiration John Friedrich, the famous con man who embezzled a few hundred thousand Deutchmarks in his native West Germany, faked his own death, then reappeared in Melbourne in the 1970s under a new name. By the 1980s, he had become the executive director of the National Safety Council of Australia (a public nonprofit that works to prevent industrial and road accidents), and proceeded to use his position to defraud the banks of hundreds of millions of dollars. When he was finally caught in 1989 and put on trial, Friedrich hired a Tasmanian aspiring novelist named  to ghostwrite his autobiography for $10,000, which the young Flanagan was instructed to complete in just six grueling weeks. In this fictional version of the story, Flanagan gives us Kif Kehlmann, a fledgling writer living hand-to-mouth with his pregnant wife and their daughter in Tasmania. Kif is approached by Ray, a fast-living, dissolute childhood friend, with the offer of a real writing gig. The famous Siegfried ""Ziggy"" Heidl, a con man set to be sentenced for defrauding the banks of 700 million dollars while running the Australian Safety Organization, needs a ghostwriter for his autobiography. The publisher will pay $10,000 for six weeks' work.

What seems a straightforward proposition is anything but, for Ziggy Heidl is anything but a willing collaborator. He won't settle down to work, instead reaching for the desk phone to engage in conversations with lawyers and journalists who, Kif begins to suspect, aren't on the line. Heidl departs on a dime for business lunches that may or may not occur. And when Kif holds him still and tries to gather facts, Heidl instead launches into wandering lectures on philosophy and humanity, quoting aphorisms and advising Kif on how to live his life.

Like Ziggy Stardust, Heidl has an ""exotic charm."" He's a chronic seducer who has learned, like every good con man, that his victims will always meet him halfway. ""Trust is the oil that greases the machine of the world. Even people we hate we trust. That's how it is. And, amazingly, mostly it works."" He also understands the power of flattery: ""So obvious, so easy. It's not foolproof, but it is proof of fools."" Frustratingly for his biographer, specifics are not part of Heidl's repertoire. ""The greatest of prophets has but the vaguest of messages,"" he tells Kif. ""The vaguer the message, the greater the prophet."" All Kif can glean are tantalizing hints of an epic, dangerous life -- work for the C.I.A. and NASA; corpses in Chile, Laos, Indonesia; a paranoia that ""the banks"" are out to assassinate him and the mystery of an A.S.O. bookkeeper who vanished in 1987. Questions, not answers. Shadows without substance. All of it, quite possibly, a lie. As a creature of his time, Kif is horrified by Heidl, for whom basic facts -- birthplace, documented events, motivations -- can never be nailed down. Contradictions are made without apology or explanation. How can someone get away with denying reality? Is it the endless Machiavellian play of the ultimate con man, or does Heidl believe what he says when he says it? Is this, Kif wonders with the naivete of a time that isn't now, the face of evil? As the weeks slip away, Kif despairs of ever finishing the book and earning the money his family desperately needs. Heidl feels none of his urgency. Instead, he seems more interested in drawing Kif into his world, creating in him an acolyte. In explaining how he kept his scam going for so long, Heidl says, ""I made it up. Every day, just like you. Like a writer.""

And then, moments later: ""What do you think a businessman is? A politician? They're sorcerers -- they make things up. Stories are all that we have to hold us together. Religion, science, money -- they're all just stories. Australia is a story, politics is a story, religion is a story, money is a story and the A.S.O. was a story. The banks just stopped believing in my story. And when belief dies, nothing is left."" While Heidl as a character is deeply compelling, and Flanagan writes with acute sensitivity about Kif's swelling anxieties made deeper by his gradually crumbling marriage, for a long stretch the story idles, taking us through the circular routine of Kif's daily slog. He heads into the publisher's office, either despairing or full of renewed purpose, and Heidl parries successfully. It's a relief when the six weeks runs out and the story steams ahead again, taking unexpected turns and raising the stakes for everyone. Here, too, is where Flanagan's thinly veiled autobiography ends, for instead of growing into a Booker Prize-winning novelist, Kif finds success creating reality TV shows, where fiction and reality are indistinguishable. It's a sign of the times. ""We need a man like Ziggy now,"" Ray tells him. ""Someone who does, someone who gets it done. Not for himself. For others. For us."" Heidl may have cheated the banks, Ray points out, but the banks cheat everyone else, and perhaps they deserve to be swindled even more. Looking around, Kif realizes that Ziggy Heidl was not so much the face of evil as he was the face of the future. This fact is brought home when Kif visits New York and drinks with Pia, his old editor. They're accosted by one of her authors, a glittering young literary star from Brooklyn who only writes autobiography. With the absolute surety that only experience can erode, she says, ""Just the thought of a fabricated character doing fabricated things in a fabricated story makes me want to gag. I am totally hoping never to read another novel again."" Kif, who long ago gave up novels for reality TV, doesn't bother to argue -- it's their world now, anyway, not his. Like so much autobiography, ""First Person"" is about nostalgia, for a lost age when once we could be horrified by outright lies, use the word ""evil"" to describe it and fear what might follow our acceptance of it.","In ""First Person,"" Richard Flanagan explores the permeable boundary between fact and fiction.",efd34d88-c2f2-5773-9b70-179755ab1886,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/03/books/review/03STEINHAUER/03STEINHAUER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=92fb9c072e5805275a3cbfba3ad2ac034088698fe0a87b5eba66885a80f3f86c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Richard Flanagan,efd34d88-c2f2-5773-9b70-179755ab1886,N24News/imgs/efd34d88-c2f2-5773-9b70-179755ab1886.jpg,13
Science,"In 'Enormous Success,' Scientists Tie 52 Genes to Human Intelligence",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/science/52-genes-human-intelligence.html,"In a significant advance in the study of mental ability, a team of European and American scientists announced on Monday that they had identified 52 genes linked to intelligence in nearly 80,000 people. These genes do not determine intelligence, however. Their combined influence is minuscule, the researchers said, suggesting that thousands more are likely to be involved and still await discovery. Just as important, intelligence is profoundly shaped by the environment. Still, the findings could make it possible to begin new experiments into the biological basis of reasoning and problem-solving, experts said. They could even help researchers determine which interventions would be most effective for children struggling to learn. ""This represents an enormous success,"" said Paige Harden, a psychologist at the University of Texas, who was not involved in the study.

For over a century, psychologists have studied intelligence by asking people questions. Their exams have evolved into batteries of tests, each probing a different mental ability, such as verbal reasoning or memorization. In a typical test, the tasks might include imagining an object rotating, picking out a shape to complete a figure, and then pressing a button as fast as possible whenever a particular type of word appears. Each test-taker may get varying scores for different abilities. But over all, these scores tend to hang together -- people who score low on one measure tend to score low on the others, and vice versa. Psychologists sometimes refer to this similarity as general intelligence. It's still not clear what in the brain accounts for intelligence. Neuroscientists have compared the brains of people with high and low test scores for clues, and they've found a few. Brain size explains a small part of the variation, for example, although there are plenty of people with small brains who score higher than others with bigger brains.

Other studies hint that intelligence has something to do with how efficiently a brain can send signals from one region to another. Danielle Posthuma, a geneticist at Vrije University Amsterdam and senior author of the new paper, first became interested in the study of intelligence in the 1990s. ""I've always been intrigued by how it works,"" she said. ""Is it a matter of connections in the brain, or neurotransmitters that aren't sufficient?"" Dr. Posthuma wanted to find the genes that influence intelligence. She started by studying identical twins who share the same DNA. Identical twins tended to have more similar intelligence test scores than fraternal twins, she and her colleagues found. Hundreds of other studies have come to the same conclusion, showing a clear genetic influence on intelligence. But that doesn't mean that intelligence is determined by genes alone. Our environment exerts its own effects, only some of which scientists understand well. Lead in drinking water, for instance, can drag down test scores. In places where food doesn't contain iodine, giving supplements to children can raise scores. Advances in DNA sequencing technology raised the possibility that researchers could find individual genes underlying differences in intelligence test scores. Some candidates were identified in small populations, but their effects did not reappear in studies on larger groups. So scientists turned to what's now called the genome-wide association study: They sequence bits of genetic material scattered across the DNA of many unrelated people, then look to see whether people who share a particular condition -- say, a high intelligence test score -- also share the same genetic marker.

In 2014, Dr. Posthuma was part of a large-scale study of over 150,000 people that revealed 108 genes linked to schizophrenia. But she and her colleagues had less luck with intelligence, which has proved a hard nut to crack for a few reasons. Standard intelligence tests can take a long time to complete, making it hard to gather results on huge numbers of people. Scientists can try combining smaller studies, but they often have to merge different tests together, potentially masking the effects of genes. As a result, the first generation of genome-wide association studies on intelligence failed to find any genes. Later studies managed to turn up promising results, but when researchers turned to other groups of people, the effect of the genes again disappeared.

""I thought, 'Of course we're not going to find anything,'"" she said. She was wrong. To her surprise, 52 genes emerged with firm links to intelligence. A dozen had turned up in earlier studies, but 40 were entirely new. But all of these genes together account for just a small percentage of the variation in intelligence test scores, the researchers found; each variant raises or lowers I.Q. by only a small fraction of a point. ""It means there's a long way to go, and there are going to be a lot of other genes that are going to be important,"" Dr. Posthuma said. Christopher F. Chabris, a co-author of the new study at Geisinger Health System in Danville, Pa., was optimistic that many of those missing genes would come to light, thanks to even larger studies involving hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people. ""It's just like astronomy getting better with bigger telescopes,"" he said. In the new study, Dr. Posthuma and her colleagues limited their research to people of European descent because that raised the odds of finding common genetic variants linked to intelligence. But other gene studies have shown that variants in one population can fail to predict what people are like in other populations. Different variants turn out to be important in different groups, and this may well be the case with intelligence. ""If you try to predict height using the genes we've identified in Europeans in Africans, you'd predict all Africans are five inches shorter than Europeans, which isn't true,"" Dr. Posthuma said.

Studies like the one published today don't mean that intelligence is fixed by our genes, experts noted. ""If we understand the biology of something, that doesn't mean we're putting it down to determinism,"" Dr. Ritchie said. As an analogy, he noted that nearsightedness is strongly influenced by genes. But we can change the environment -- in the form of eyeglasses -- to improve people's eyesight. Dr. Harden predicted that an emerging understanding of the genetics of intelligence would make it possible to find better ways to help children develop intellectually. Knowing people's genetic variations would help scientists measure how effective different strategies are. Still, Dr. Harden said, we don't have to wait for such studies to change people's environments for the better. ""We know that lead harms children's intellectual abilities,"" she said. ""There's low-hanging policy fruit here."" For her part, Dr. Posthuma wants to make sense of the 52 genes she and her colleagues discovered. There are intriguing overlaps between their influence on intelligence and on other traits. The genetic variants that raise intelligence also tend to pop up more frequently in people who have never smoked. Some of them also are found more often in people who take up smoking but quit successfully. As for what the genes actually do, Dr. Posthuma can't say. Four of them are known to control the development of cells, for example, and three do an assortment of things inside neurons.

To understand what makes these genes special, scientists may need to run experiments on brain cells. One possibility would be to take cells from people with variants that predict high and low intelligence. She and her colleagues might coax them to develop into neurons, which could then grow into ""mini-brains"" -- clusters of neurons that exchange signals in the laboratory. Researchers could then see if their genetic differences made them behave differently. ""We can't do it overnight,"" Dr. Posthuma said, ""but it's something I hope to be able to do in the future.""","The genes account for just a tiny fraction of the variation in test scores, experts say. Many are yet to be found, and environmental factors are also greatly important.",0ef26256-611d-5fbd-b5e2-58c77243531b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/23/science/23INTELLIGENCEJP/23INTELLIGENCEJP-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=b8bd1e052f433ff786cfac84611918f97439e170888d2f9af4074df09449df88&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Blood samples from some participants in a new study of genes linked to intelligence were held at the U.K. Biobank, above.",0ef26256-611d-5fbd-b5e2-58c77243531b,N24News/imgs/0ef26256-611d-5fbd-b5e2-58c77243531b.jpg,2
Real Estate,Boldface Buildings in the Cold Light of Now,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/realestate/starchitect-buildings-test-the-value-of-a-name.html,"AT the height of the condo building boom in Manhattan, when it seemed as if a shiny new building was being announced every week, developers took a page from the motion picture industry and seized on star power to sell their projects. In the same way that George Clooney and Meryl Streep could be counted on to carry a picture, these brand-name architects, or ""starchitects,"" as they came to be known, helped to set a building apart and gave buyers another reason to want to live there. The names on the marquees included Richard Meier, Enrique Norten, Robert A. M. Stern, Philip Johnson and Annabelle Selldorf, as well as designers focused on interiors, like Philippe Starck and Giorgio Armani. The boldface treatment worked, helping to push prices ever higher. But you don't need a subscription to Variety to know that star power sometimes dims. Now that the dust has settled and these buildings have had a few years to age and see some turnover, resale prices show mixed results. Although none of the starchitects have suffered enough to be considered box office poison, some buildings that had not sold out when the recession hit have had to offer hefty discounts. Others, while still commanding good prices relative to nearby buildings, are not holding their initial value.

Still others, like Mr. Stern's 15 Central Park West and Superior Ink, have continued to set sales records. This era is not the first in which New Yorkers have turned to trusted names to build their homes. During the 1920s building boom, Rosario Candela, J. E. R. Carpenter and Emery Roth designed apartment houses that quickly came to define luxury. Today, their apartments are still coveted for their high ceilings, elegant details and gracious layouts. Their names, just like those of their 21st-century equivalents, often translate into added value, but do not guarantee it. Mr. Meier's glass towers, 173-176 Perry and 165 Charles, off the West Side Highway, are credited with helping to extend the boundaries of the West Village, but his venture into Brooklyn at 1 Grand Army Plaza has not fared as well: sales started in 2007, and five years later the building has yet to sell out. Also, nearly every resale at Philip Johnson's Urban Glass House in SoHo, which opened in 2006, has been for less than the original purchase price, according to data on Streeteasy.com.

""The city is better for the starchitect phenomenon,"" said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel, ""because it enhanced the mystique of New York's residential housing market. But during the frenzy, those buildings were marketed as if they had inherent greater value, and the jury is still out on that."" Mr. Miller said that people who bought apartments in buildings with design pedigrees may not be getting better returns than those who bought in luxury buildings without famous names attached. ""With the exception of the very top of the market, the city has gone into a much more austere mind-set,"" he said. ""I'm not convinced having a starchitect differentiates a building nearly as much as it did before."" When Mr. Norten's One York Street in TriBeCa came to market in mid-2008, several units sold for close to their asking prices. But after the financial crisis, sales slowed and asking prices dropped by as much as 24 percent. Even then, however, many apartments sold at discounts of about 10 percent. Several apartments have been resold since 2008, each for less than the original purchase price. Mr. Norten nonetheless sees One York as ""a huge success,"" noting that the penthouse sold for $23.7 million, or nearly $3,900 per square foot, an extraordinary figure for a building off Canal Street. Two-bedrooms in the building have sold for $1.8 million to $4.7 million. Mr. Norten feels that the starchitect concept was overblown by developers and the media. During the boom, he said, the desire for a brand name may have gotten out of hand. ""Developers were not just looking for architecture brand, they were looking for any brand,"" including designers like Armani and Mick Jagger's daughter Jade, he said. ""Of course I love Mick Jagger, but does that make a good apartment?""

Indeed, several high-profile buildings are in the works, including Christian de Portzamparc's One57, a 90-story tower on West 57th Street; Jean Nouvel's Tower Verre, a 78-story structure that is to include gallery space for the Museum of Modern Art; and Herzog & de Meuron's tower at 56 Leonard Street. Darren Sukenik, a managing director of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that buyers had become more discerning in recent years. ""People are no longer buying just for starchitect appeal,"" he said. ""Now, it's more about quiet consumption."" At the high end, he added, ""people aren't looking to be sold a lifestyle, they're looking to have their lifestyle understood and respected."" To that end, he is working on a project with an architectural firm chosen by the developers (he would not divulge its name) for its popularity with the target audience. ""Instead of trying to sell them sizzle,"" he said, ""the developers turned to the buyer profile for inspiration."" For brand-name buildings that have not maintained value, location may be a factor. The price drops at Philip Johnson's Urban Glass House, which has interiors by Annabelle Selldorf, ""had nothing to do with design and everything to do with the city's decision to build a sanitation building next door,"" said Leonard Steinberg, a managing director of Prudential Douglas Elliman who is working with Ms. Selldorf on a recent project, 200 Eleventh Avenue. Uncertainty about the garage, which is still under construction, definitely hurt resales, Mr. Steinberg said. But once the garage is done and ""people see that it's not unattractive, I think prices will go back up."" Designer buildings in the financial district, which is seeing about half the sales volume of 2007, have also had mixed results. Downtown by Philippe Starck, at 15 Broad, sold out quickly in 2006, with many owners flipping their places at huge profits. But since late 2008, about a quarter of the resales have been at a discount.

Deborah DeMaria, the agent at Warburg Realty who took over sales last year, was one of the building's first buyers. She said that she had paid about $1,200 a square foot for her apartment, and that asking prices for some units were as high as $1,700 per square foot. But the average sale price now is about $1,000 per square foot, on par with the rest of the neighborhood. The Armani name, she added, ""is still a huge draw for Europeans and other buyers who are interested in design."" Andrew Gerringer, a managing director of the Marketing Directors, says that today, a starchitect will not bring a big premium if the building is not both in ""the right location and the right product for that location."" By that reasoning, perhaps Brooklyn is not quite ready for contemporary design. Having a sales office in TriBeCa probably didn't help Mr. Meier's 1 Grand Army Plaza when it opened in 2007, said Stephen Kliegerman, the president of Terra Development Marketing, which took over sales in January through Brown Harris Stevens. ""They were trying to deny the location,"" he said. ""But most of the buyers have been Brooklynites, so that was a mistake."" Brown Harris has lowered prices on many units, and the glass tower is now nearly 80 percent sold, with an average sale price of about $900 per square foot, respectable for Prospect Heights. ""It's not as successful as originally planned,"" Mr. Kliegerman said. ""But that might have been overzealous.""

Mr. Meier says he can only guess at why his Brooklyn building has taken so long to sell. ""Is it the location? Did the market change? Is it that people there like to live in town houses more than a modern building?"" he said. ""I don't know the answer."" At the opening of an exhibition of his collages on the ground floor of the building last fall, Mr. Meier met many of the building's residents. ""Everyone came up and told me how much they loved living there,"" he said. ""That was very gratifying."" At another glass-clad building not too far away designed by Mr. Norten and promoted as ""A Modern Signature to Park Slope,"" only a handful of apartments have sold since sales started two years ago. Mr. Norten ascribed the sluggish sales mainly to the building's location. It is on Carroll Street, near Fourth Avenue, the far western edge of Park Slope. ""I think the developers were very brave in trying to upgrade with different architecture there,"" he said. ""They were taking a risk.""

Mr. Nouvel's building also came to market in 2007, though it did not start closing deals until 2010; some units have sold at 20 percent or more off the list price. Several are still available, including an eight-bedroom penthouse listed at $38.9 million. Mr. Nouvel was not available for comment. Julie Pham, a senior vice president of the Corcoran Group who has sold several apartments at 100 Eleventh, says that prospective buyers seem to be looking for a view as much as a building designed by a famous architect. Many are art collectors who appreciate the design, and many are foreign buyers who also own properties in places like Miami and Sao Paulo. ""Hypermodernism is not much of an issue for them: if anything, they like the glass,"" she said. ""Whereas New York buyers are more accustomed to not living in a fishbowl and not being on a highway."" Recession-related problems have even affected Mr. Stern, whose 15 Central Park West recently set a new record with its $88 million penthouse sale. Highgrove, a high-rise condo in Stamford, Conn., built with the prewar aesthetic of Mr. Stern's other projects, started selling apartments in 2004 but has not yet opened. The original developer went into foreclosure, and buyers filed lawsuits as their promised move-in dates came and went. The building has now changed hands, and the new owners are considering what to do with it. ""That's an example of a building that missed the market totally,"" Mr. Gerringer said. The large and gracious apartments in Highgrove are not well suited to Stamford's younger demographic, he said. Mr. Stern was traveling and unavailable for comment. Mr. Norten recalled that a few years back, his New York office was assailed by condominium design requests. ""Everybody was a developer and everybody wanted to do a building,"" he said. ""It was crazy."" Today, he said, he views potential projects with a warier eye. ""I think maybe we should all be a little more careful after we learned big lessons,"" he said.","Buildings by ""starchitects"" were all the rage during the condo building boom. But resale prices show star power goes only so far.",6d6c0fe4-9cf1-5784-ac89-0cb4133c2c2c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/03/11/realestate/11ARCHITECTS_SPAN/11ARCHITECTS_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=343&w=600&s=898e05f3c8fb4ddba5147889c7915ce55a7996a89fb721c9f5d484a2993dbb42&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Pairs from left: Robert A.

Dance,"In 'Quicksand,' an Opera-Novel Takes a Mysterious Form",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/arts/dance/in-quicksand-an-opera-novel-takes-a-mysterious-form.html,"In general, dances in operas are tacked on: divertissements unrelated to the story.

Mr. Ashley met Mr. Paxton in the 1960s, and though they worked together, ""Quicksand"" -- a merging of music, light and dance -- is considered their only major collaboration.

Art & Design,Growing Scenes for London Artists: Towns and Suburbs,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/21/arts/design/artists-hastings-luton-croydon.html,"LUTON, England -- ""People shooting up in the alleyway here. Lovely. Welcome to Luton,"" the artist Dominic Allan said on a recent afternoon as he passed two drug users in the town's rundown former hat-making district. Luton, about 30 miles north of London, was once famed for its hat industry, but those factories closed long ago. Its current most prominent businesses, an auto plant and an airport, have both been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. And in 2004, it was voted the worst place to live in Britain, according to an unscientific but much-publicized survey. Yet such towns are exactly the sort of places where hard-up contemporary artists have been gravitating in recent years as unaffordable rents have forced them out of London.

Mr. Allan is not represented by a London gallery, but his website has helped him attract publicly funded commissions. He is also among the many thousands of artists who have sold their work online via Instagram. ""Almost everything can be achieved online,"" he said. ""All you need is a laptop and a half-decent smartphone."" What he terms ""displacement"" has resulted, paradoxically, in contemporary art imbued with a new sense of place. In 2016, Mr. Allan returned from London for six months to his parents' suburban home in Luton, turning it into a project space for artists' workshops, talks and commissions. A minimalist sculpture by the Turner Prize-winning artist Martin Creed (made of bricks chosen by Mr. Allan's mother) still stands in the paved front garden, beside some gnomes.

Mr. Allan, who now divides his time between London and Luton, said he had recently been trying to rent a studio in the town but could not afford the monthly rent of almost 700 pounds, or about $900, for a space in a refurbished hat factory. ""I've been priced out,"" he said, adding that he would seek government funding to repurpose his parents' garage. All around the world, travel restrictions have put a stop to international fairs and biennials. Revenues at commercial galleries and auction houses in major cities have slumped. But artists in more low-key locations are quietly carrying on with their work. ""In London, you're so worried about paying your rent, you can't afford a Chinese takeaway,"" Sophie Barber, a 24-year-old painter, said in an interview in the spacious studio she rents for PS560 a month in an industrial area on the edge of the seaside town of Hastings, 70 miles southeast of London.

""Hastings is very different from London. The conversations are intergenerational,"" she added, referring to the positive influence of older artists in the area, as she tried with limited success to stop the chickens from running across her canvases. Hastings, with its scrappy mix of stately but unkempt 19th-century houses, 1970s seafront amusements, poor transportation links and limited employment opportunities, was recently ranked as the most deprived town in southern England by Britain's housing ministry. But its distinctness and affordability have long been valued by artists. Many artists are based in the area, including internationally known names such as John Stezaker and Becky Beasley (who mentored Ms. Barber). So, too, is the respected public gallery Hastings Contemporary.

That artistic bent has predictably attracted migratory Londoners, and average house prices in the town have increased nearly 30 percent since 2015. Now, the process of gentrification has been accelerated by the pandemic, said Tina Morris, the director of the local Coastal Currents arts festival. ""Everyone wants to sell here,"" said Ms. Morris, citing as an example a house in central Hastings priced at PS350,000. She pointed out a nearby mural by the local street artist Drew Copus that was featured in the real estate agent's marketing material. Yet the artist himself is now homeless. Mr. Copus said in an interview that he had been unable to afford the going monthly rate of PS550 rent for a one-room apartment in Hastings. ""They used to be PS400,"" he said, adding that he had previously worked part-time as a cook to supplement his income, but that dried up because of the pandemic.

Nurturing conditions also prevail at Turf Projects, another nonprofit Croydon space, based in a 1970s shopping mall, where studios cost PS120 a month. Since its foundation by local artists in 2013, Turf has supported more than 400 fellow creatives through a busy program of free public exhibitions, events and workshops in the community. ""It's good to be located in a shopping center. It changes the kind of people who drop in."" said Becky Atherton, one of the project's founders. ""Our vision is an art world that doesn't run alongside society but is interwoven with it."" This vision of an accessible, locally grounded art scene is very different from the elitist flying circus of blockbuster exhibitions, auctions, fairs and biennials in destination cities that has dominated the art world in recent years.

With the upscale galleries of Manhattan and Mayfair all but deserted, the pandemic and the internet could foster a new spirit of regionalism, and new kinds of art. Over the next year or two, as always, interesting art is going to be made. But it might not be made in the places the art world is used to.",The pandemic has accelerated a creative exodus.,906cc8a4-e029-5914-8b55-c76734566ce2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/21/arts/21unlovely-towns1/21crap-towns1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c09aa2833625b0f0fd8b4e54768dcdb4c2ff133298bb116f147492221e8f961c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A mural by the artist Mark Titchner in Luton, England, about 30 miles north of London.",906cc8a4-e029-5914-8b55-c76734566ce2,N24News/imgs/906cc8a4-e029-5914-8b55-c76734566ce2.jpg,14
Automobiles,"On Their Way to Pebble Beach, Driving Every Mile",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/automobiles/collectibles/on-their-way-to-pebble-beach-driving-every-mile.html,"On Their Way to Pebble Beach, Driving Every Mile

MUSCLING his 1931 Pierce-Arrow through a sharp turn in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest of Washington State, Al McEwan might have been living out a passage from ""The Kings of the Road,"" a book he read and reread as a boy. ""Many a man still alive remembers the day when he ripped down a country road in a canary-yellow, bucket-seated Mercer,"" Ken W. Purdy, a pioneering automotive journalist, wrote in his 1949 tribute to great machines of earlier times, ""master of all he surveyed, high-riding, able to see where he was going, with a wheel in his hands that really steered the car instead of shyly suggesting that it change direction."" The book's tattered pages have long since loosened from their binding, but Mr. McEwan, at 77, still has that first edition. At this moment, however, he was too busy for reflection: the big phaeton lurched, the tires screeched and the rear end started to slide. ""Al, be careful,"" his wife, Sandi, said reprovingly from the back seat. ""This isn't a race."" Not a race indeed, but the Pebble Beach Motoring Classic, a 1,500-mile tour now in its eighth year as an official prelude to Sunday's concours d'elegance. The concours caps a week of collector-car auctions, shows and vintage races that take place each August on the Monterey Peninsula of California.

Chastened, Mr. McEwan grunted, wresting the thick steering wheel into a course correction. The 5,000-pound convertible settled down, resuming its glide over the two-lane highway that winds through towering spires of Douglas fir and alder trees. As tour master for the 2012 motoring tour, which left Kirkland, Wash., on Aug. 7 and arrived in Pebble Beach eight days later, Mr. McEwan knows firsthand the mishaps that can occur when 17 mostly ancient vehicles embark on a journey over arduous terrain. In 2006, a forest fire swept across Highway 35 in Oregon, blocking the tour's planned route to a lodge at the 6,000-foot level of Mount Hood. The McEwans worked all night, painstakingly rewriting the directions for the route book. In 2008, Arturo Keller, a prominent collector, fell from his prewar Alfa Romeo when a door swung open in a slow turn. Luckily, he (and the car) escaped serious injury. ""Something always comes up you can't plan for,"" said Mr. McEwan, whose Pierce-Arrow foundered shortly after the group entered California, but returned to the road with its head gasket replaced. ""Old cars break. You just have to roll with that."" Along the route, drivers were treated to dazzling views of volcanic peaks in the Cascade Range, the Columbia River Gorge, the crystal blue waters of Crater Lake and the redwood stands of Northern California's rugged coast. The tour then swung inland through the Sonoma County wine region, crossed the Golden Gate Bridge and motored through San Francisco toward Monterey.

In addition to a van for participants' luggage, the convoy included a so-called trouble truck for hauling mechanics and disabled cars, and a new company-supplied Bentley sedan to ferry stranded drivers and passengers. If somebody got in a jam, other participants pulled over to help. ""Most of us guys can fix anything,"" Denny Dochnahl, owner of a 1928 Packard from Renton, Wash., said. After a pause: ""Except a modern car."" Knuckle-scuffing repairs become part of the tour's lore, gleefully passed along at each day's dinner party. Not all the tales end happily. Tortuous roads, like the twisty drive from Leggett, Calif., to the coast, blistering temperatures and steep climbs forced several cars to retire, including a prized 1912 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost that served in World War I and a stately Packard, discovered by its current owner to be the same car his father bought new in 1928. (It later returned to the tour.) For some time, the classic car world has been moving away from what Sandra Button, chairman of the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, calls its ""super-tidy, spit and polish"" era. Spurred by Europeans' disdain for overly restored cars, concours officials have been emphasizing more original-condition, or preservation, vehicles.

""The motoring classic,"" she said, ""is about enjoying these cars as they were meant to be enjoyed -- on the road."" The tour, which costs $9,000 a couple, is open to cars that have been entries in the Pebble Beach concours, are current entrants or deemed ""Pebble-appropriate."" The fee covers meals, stays in elegant and rustic settings and admittance to auctions, private receptions and parties restricted to concours participants. Shipped, trucked or flown into Seattle, the cars have come from as far as Australia and New Zealand, with regular entries from European countries as well as North America. The drivers also come from varied backgrounds. Jules Heumann, a former chairman of the Pebble Beach concours, who drove a swoop-fendered, black-and-plum Hispano-Suiza, designed and built furniture for his family's company in San Francisco. Another Hispano owner, Hugo Modderman, lives in Monaco and finances cruise ships. Mr. McEwan is a retired aeronautical engineer. The cars can be more valuable than the most expensive offerings in any luxury showroom. Mr. Modderman paid $200,000 for his 1930 Hispano-Suiza H6C Cabriolet de Ville, one of 15 vehicles in his collection, and another $300,000 went into its restoration. Jaime and Cecelia Muldoon's two-tone 1953 Ferrari America is worth in the ""low millions,"" according to a vintage car broker, Bruce Trenery. For Mr. McEwan's inspired caravan, however, the tour is about a shared passion for cars and history. Bruce Campbell, a former advertising executive from Alamo, Calif., spent five years doing research before beginning the restoration of one of his cars. Mr. Campbell began this year's tour in a bright red 1953 Alfa Romeo coupe; when the Alfa developed starter problems, he continued in his Austin-Healey 100 roadster. ""It's astonishing that something so beautiful and functional could be made by hand,"" Mr. Campbell said of the Alfa. The car's wooden steering wheel, custom-made by Touring, the coachbuilder, is one of fewer than two dozen in existence.

""People touched these cars,"" Mr. Campbell said. ""They didn't just touch a button that made the cars. And they didn't make them only to sit on a lawn and be looked at."" Mr. Modderman revels in auto sociology. As originally built for a member of the Vanderbilt family, the Hispano-Suiza offered little weather protection for the chauffeur, so a custom top was added. But there is no record of other bastions of class being relaxed. ""By custom, the lady was never to see a driver's hands,"" Mr. Modderman explained, forcing the chauffeur to handle the hefty vehicle using only the wheel's lower half. Like Mr. McEwan, most tour participants trace their interest in cars to childhood. Only one owner in this year's tour was younger than 50, and several were in their 70s. Mr. Heumann, the Classic's oldest driver ever, is 89. ""I've been in this hobby since I was 1 year old,"" Mr. Heumann said, ""and I'm still on the good side of 90. I'm not stopping now."" For a Mercer roadster in the group -- a 1925 Raceabout in the same canary-yellow summoned by the writer Ken Purdy -- stopping came early. Despite a fresh restoration by its owners, Johnny and Christine Crowell of San Ramon, Calif., and the fierce, grizzly growl of its engine, this final factory-built Raceabout overheated after just three miles. Undaunted, the Crowells rejoined the tour in another car from their collection, a 1932 V-16 Cadillac. The Mercer continued to Pebble Beach by truck, where it was scheduled to appear in a special concours display. ""It reminds me of my daughter's horse,"" Mr. Crowell, a lawyer who owns a chain of stores, said philosophically. ""Buying the horse was the cheap part.""","The Pebble Beach Motoring Classic is a driving tour of classic cars that goes from Washington State to California and is a prelude to the concours.

Food,What to Cook This Week,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/dining/what-to-cook-this-week.html,"Good morning. I wrote about a terrific dish for The Times this weekend, a meatloaf Stroganoff (above) that I first ate a million years ago at the restaurant M. Wells in Queens and have been cooking in some form ever since. I think you could make a version today off my recipe using ground beef or lamb or that soy-protein ground beefless stuff and, just so long as you nap the thing in enough mushroom-enhanced gravy, you'll end up with your favorite wintertime dinner of the year.

Make like Hugue Dufour, the chef at M. Wells, and add some foie gras to the gravy, or a few spoonfuls of chicken-liver mousse. Either way, I like the meatloaf with buttered noodles. Dufour served it with spaetzle. You do you. Rice would be a fine accompaniment, as well, along with a big salad.

So that's today! Monday, you can downshift a little, get out of the foie zone, cook and eat some chana dal, perhaps the highest form of chickpeas. Or if you're looking for something a little more substantial, you could try this crunchy eggplant Parm. (I like it on a hero roll, as if after a long day TIG welding stainless steel.)

For Tuesday dinner, try my recipe for cod cakes, which in truth you could cook with any fish that flakes; I made a version a while back with triggerfish that was shockingly rich. Of course you can make it with bread crumbs. But I do love cracker crumbs in this application.",Meatloaf Stroganoff could be your new favorite wintertime dinner.,ccd8c948-a2b9-5d9e-9728-36e0224af05a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/17/magazine/17mag-eat-slide-Y0D9-copy/17mag-eat-slide-Y0D9-facebookJumbo.png?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=e70ecbfd5e7a2d38b284cb46bf3522a10b38662736fb7f5c8457863841a4506c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Meatloaf Stroganoff can provide a little winter magic.,ccd8c948-a2b9-5d9e-9728-36e0224af05a,N24News/imgs/ccd8c948-a2b9-5d9e-9728-36e0224af05a.jpg,17
Sports,"For Aging Masters Champions, Pandemic Cannot Mute Augusta's Call",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/13/sports/golf/masters-champions-dinner.html,"AUGUSTA, Ga. -- The men met for dinner at Augusta National Golf Club on Tuesday night. They donned their green jackets, asked after grandchildren, cracked wise, drank wine and thought back to the long-ago shots that were their meal tickets now. They gathered because that is what most men who won the Masters do during tournament week. And despite the coronavirus pandemic, it was unfathomable to many of golf's princes that they would miss a meeting of one of the most hallowed fraternities in sports. ""I'm going to put my mask on and drive over there,"" Tommy Aaron, the 83-year-old champion from 1973, said by telephone last week, his voice as soft as his intentions were firm. ""You never know when your last trip to Augusta is going to be,"" observed Charles Coody, 83, who won in 1971.

""I don't get to see the guys too often anymore,"" said Bob Goalby, the 1968 champion who is now 91. ""What brings you back is your friendship with the guys. Even though you don't play anymore, you get kind of enthused about seeing the place and seeing the young guys practice on the range."" No other golf tournament attracts its most cherished alumni quite like the Masters, and many former champions submitted to nasal swabs to be able to gaze upon the greens again. Some older winners -- more than half of the 33 living Masters winners are at least 60 years old -- considered walking part of the course, free of dense crowds because of the pandemic, for the first time in years.

Still, seven winners are absent this week, with at least some missing for pandemic-related reasons, including misgivings about travel. Sergio Garcia, the 2017 victor, withdrew from the tournament after he tested positive for the virus. ""It's always sad when some people are not there, but to look at it in a positive light, so many were there,"" said Gary Player, 85, who won the Masters three times and spoke at Tuesday's dinner.

Indeed, the pandemic hardly seemed to rattle most of the winners, many of whom saw the golf and Augusta's traditions as too great to ignore, even in 2020. Sixteen past champions are playing this week and even though Player and Jack Nicklaus are not, they started the tournament with a ceremonial tee shot around daybreak on Thursday. Nicklaus and his wife, Barbara, tested positive for coronavirus in March. ""I just played three months in a row, so why wouldn't I come here?"" asked Bernhard Langer, who turned 63 in August and won in 1985 and 1993. ""I can social distance. I don't have to hug anybody or whatever or do high-fives."" Others who are competing had feared that they would not make it because of travel restrictions. ""It seemed very hard because I was marooned in Scotland for seven months, eight months,"" said Sandy Lyle, the 1988 champion. But there he was at sunset on Monday, practicing putts and hoping to string together sufficiently low scores to make the Masters cut, set this year at the low 50s, for the first time since 2014. ""We're still getting through this,"" Lyle, 62, added about the pandemic. ""We've got to be very happy that we're even playing golf for prize money right now."" So to look around Augusta National this week was still to spot winners, an exercise made easier than usual because of this year's ban on spectators. Fred Couples, the 1992 winner, and Tiger Woods practiced together, as did Langer and Lyle. A few minutes after Vijay Singh, the champion in 2000, started hitting at No. 1 on Tuesday morning, Patrick Reed, who won 18 years after Singh, started a round from nearby No. 10. More came for the Champions Dinner, a closed-door rite of the tournament for past winners and the club chairman.

""Once I found out that I knew a lot of the players were going, some of the older ones, I was all in,"" said Mark O'Meara, who won in 1998 and was among those who flew to Georgia this week. ""To be fortunate enough to be a Masters champion, it's probably the right thing to do, even though I'm not going to play.""","Despite the coronavirus crisis, many of the older men who won the Masters reunited at the tournament that helped make them famous. Some are even playing.",70ee8d4a-db71-5cd9-b083-0e4c6d17ffac,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/13/sports/13golf-champions01/13golf-champions01-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=9f719f4d75debbfcbd03c90ea5f07e58dac58891a9e3754cbcb1d2903f27091d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jack Nicklaus started the Masters with a ceremonial tee shot around daybreak on Thursday.

Economy,The Election's Effect on the Economy? Doughnut Sales Are Probably Safe,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/business/economy/the-elections-effect-on-the-economy-doughnut-sales-are-probably-safe.html,"The coming election will give the United States new lawmakers and a new president. But what does it mean for fast food, leisure cruises and bulldozers? As the nation's bitter, bizarre campaign season builds to its November conclusion, companies across a range of industries are using the election as a data point -- sometimes as an excuse -- to explain what's happening in their business. Executives at Jack in the Box said uncertainty over the election could be affecting consumers' willingness to buy Jumbo Jacks and cheeseburgers. Commercial real estate brokers said the election was causing businesses to hold off on new office leases. Auto dealers said the results could determine how many people buy cars. From banking to oil to pharmaceutical companies, to real estate agents and even cruise ship operators, everyone seems to think wariness ahead of the election is affecting their business. Sometimes for the better, mostly for the worse.

""It's essentially untrackable and unknowable,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. The problem with blaming unease over the election for disappointing business results is that there is faint evidence for it in the broader data. Businesses continue to hire at a decent clip, new home sales are steady and measures of consumer confidence are down but not by much. And on Monday, the Commerce Department reported that consumer spending was up 0.5 percent in September, a very healthy gain. That is not to say that government policy doesn't matter over the longer run -- Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump are offering starkly contrasting prescriptions for improving the economy -- just that worries about the outcome are probably not a big factor affecting coffee and doughnut sales these days. In late October, Nigel Travis, chief executive of Dunkin' Brands, cited several reasons that quarterly revenues at the company that runs the Dunkin' Donuts chain fell short of analyst expectations, including ""changes in gas prices, changes in food stamp regulations, and, of course, the overwhelming dampening effect of the presidential election."" ""I think we'll all be pleased when that's passed,"" he said. Various research papers suggest that elections and policy decisions can weigh heavily on businesses' thinking. But for the most part, it seems limited to large-scale investment decisions that take years to show up in the data, and even then are hard to tease out from all the other things going on.

""We have disappointingly weak economic growth, a labor market that in some sense is strong but is still leaving people behind,"" said Ed Leamer, director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast in Los Angeles. ""People attribute what they see to one of several things that are displayed as being different: 'It's global warming. It's uncertainty about the election.' But I believe in evidence."" Most of the evidence for election uncertainty comes from anecdotal accounts like corporate conference calls. The Federal Reserve's most recent Beige Book report, a survey of regional economic conditions based largely on discussions with local business leaders, also makes several mentions of election uncertainty. What they add up to is harder to say. Office brokers in New England said leasing was flat, possibly because businesses were waiting until after the election. But real estate brokers in the region cited ""low interest rates and the impending presidential election as motivation for potential homeowners to buy now."" The Fed report also said auto dealers in Houston, who have been hit hard by cuts in the oil industry, were pessimistic about the future and had ""concerns about how the presidential election will impact consumer spending.""
* What happened on Day 2 of Elizabeth Holmes's testimony.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations. For all the data economists have about how much consumers and businesses are spending, there is still an endless debate about why they are behaving the way they do. That is easier to gauge during boom times or a recession. It is harder during more normal times like these, when the economy is merely chugging along, with conflicting signs of optimism and pessimism almost anywhere you look. And for all the differences between Republicans and Democrats, Washington's effect on the vast American economy is far more muted than in many other countries, largely because the basic tenets of democratic capitalism are widely shared and the range of policy choices are constrained by popular opinion and the vast array of interest groups. ""If I were to tell you that the people running for president were Hugo Chavez and someone else, you might say it's reasonable to start saving more,"" said Tarek Alexander Hassan, an economics professor at the University of Chicago. ""Once you start having to worry about the political system, it's pretty much the only thing you have to worry about.""

Political choices matter in the United States, of course. It is just that the effect is smaller and harder to see than in, say, Venezuela. Mr. Hassan and three other colleagues recently circulated a working paper in which they tried to figure this out. They measured how much time executives spent talking about political risk on corporate earnings calls, to see if the results could predict what their companies did later. They found that the more executives talked about risks associated with politics, the more likely they were to cut back on hiring and investment and to ramp up their spending on lobbying. That does not automatically mean politics is to blame. Some of those executives might be deflecting from company's poor performance, using government policy as an excuse for cuts they were likely to make anyway. Some might be angling for a political handout. Others might genuinely be worried about policy, regulation and taxes, but mostly because they are in an industry whose fortunes are more tied to federal spending. During a third-quarter earnings call last week, Michael DeWalt, a vice president at Caterpillar, the heavy equipment maker, was cautiously optimistic that his company could benefit from an increase in infrastructure spending in the United States -- something that both candidates have promised they would do. And given that both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump plan to make changes to the nation's health care system -- Mr. Trump has promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act -- it is no wonder that John Lechleiter, chief executive of Eli Lilly, said he and other health care executives were expecting changes of some sort.","Long-term investment, however, might be tamped down as businesses wait to see how policy might change under a new administration, experts said.",148f5e66-cb6c-53ed-86ed-49048d583e33,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/01/business/economy/01UNCERTAINTY-1477955906975/01UNCERTAINTY-1477955906975-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=a3c0fb3ecbe17d503fa75ed817f37015d9d3f3396164ec0e13b73573ec6cf2ee&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"In October, the chief executive of Dunkin' Brands, said the presidential election had an ""overwhelming dampening effect"" on Dunkin' Donuts' sales.",148f5e66-cb6c-53ed-86ed-49048d583e33,N24News/imgs/148f5e66-cb6c-53ed-86ed-49048d583e33.jpg,8
Television,Jerry Harris to Remain in Custody After Arrest on Child Pornography Charge,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/21/arts/television/jerry-harris-child-pornography-hearing.html,"Jerry Harris, the breakout star of the Emmy-winning Netflix series ""Cheer"" who was arrested last week and charged with producing child pornography, will remain in custody, a court decided on Monday. His lawyer waived both his detention and preliminary hearings at a 10-minute hearing in a federal court in Chicago.

Mr. Harris, who dialed into the hearing by phone, was represented by three lawyers, who appeared in person in the courtroom. His lead lawyer, Todd Pugh, asked the judge to postpone a decision about whether Mr. Harris will be released on bond, saying he did not yet have a plan for where Mr. Harris could stay if he were released.

The judge, Sunil R. Harjani, asked Mr. Harris if he understood that his lawyer was waiving his right and that he would be in custody until a plan is in place, at which time he could ask the court to consider releasing him on bond.

Judge Harjani ordered that Mr. Harris remain in custody in Chicago until a next hearing, which had not been scheduled.","A lawyer for Mr. Harris, star of the Emmy-winning Netflix series ""Cheer,"" waived his initial hearings on Monday.",9779d552-3ef6-577c-88ea-257a3e631dbe,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/21/arts/21jerry-harris-item/21jerry-harris-item-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=1fccc34b1184260e1e3a64a997fc3174ee0942f085ee2c25a4600159de0a02e5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jerry Harris, who dialed into a hearing on Monday by phone.

Books,Han Kang's Novel Is a Politically Tinged Eulogy for a Dead Sister,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/books/review/han-kang-white-book.html,"The narrator travels through a cityscape that bears visible traces of World War II: ""The boundaries that separate old from new, the seams bearing witness to destruction, lie conspicuously exposed. It was on that day, as I walked through the park, that she first came into my mind."" That ""she"" is the narrator's older sister, who died ""less than two hours into life."" ""They lay there on the kitchen floor, my mother on her side with the dead baby clutched to her chest, feeling the cold gradually enter into the flesh, sinking through to the bone."" The confluence of the resurrected city and the lost sister becomes the through-line for a novel told in flashes and fragments, as an act of memory and incantation.

Smith's rendering of ""The White Book"" cannot be accused of prolixity. The novel is composed of short entries centered on a word or phrase having to do with the color white, opening with a list that includes ""salt,"" ""shroud"" and ""blank paper."" From this, the narrator constructs the novel: ""Now, in this moment, I feel that vertiginous thrill course through me. As I step recklessly into time I have not yet lived, into this book I have not yet written.""

What follows is a text shot through with ""vertiginous thrill."" The dead sister haunts the narrator: ""For there are moments, lying in the darkened room, when the chill in the air is a palpable presence. Don't die. For God's sake don't die. ... Perhaps I, too, have opened my eyes in the darkness, as she did, and gazed out.""

The novel moves fluidly between the ""I"" and the ""she,"" in shifts between first and third person, but also in the slow collapse of the boundary between the narrator and the sister, the living and the dead. This culminates in the forging of an alternate history of the sister's birth: ""And yet, before dawn, when the first milk finally came from her mother's breasts and she pressed her nipple between the tiny lips, she found that, despite everything, the baby was still breathing. Though she had, by now, slipped from consciousness, the nipple in her mouth encouraged a soft swallowing, gradually growing stronger.""

Resurrection is a theme throughout Han's work, one that is tied up in political and collective memory. In ""Human Acts,"" a writer observes an illegal police raid on a group of activists. In it, she sees the specter of the 1980 Gwangju Uprising, a sustained protest against South Korea's military government that resulted in hundreds of civilian deaths: ""I remember being glued to the television ... and surprising myself with the words that sprang from my mouth: But that's Gwangju. ... The radioactive spread is ongoing. Gwangju had been reborn only to be butchered again in an endless cycle. It was razed to the ground, and raised up anew in a bloodied rebirth.""","In ""The White Book,"" a Korean novelist wanders the city of Warsaw, haunted by her family's loss — and by her country's inability to mourn its own losses.",5ee8b3b5-ea0f-5a9d-bd5f-e676abe5572f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/03/books/review/03Kitamura1/03Kitamura1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=67662f7281d886337638a90659dfd7724d4d966156a55a907cd1a76f282a35c7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Han Kang,5ee8b3b5-ea0f-5a9d-bd5f-e676abe5572f,N24News/imgs/5ee8b3b5-ea0f-5a9d-bd5f-e676abe5572f.jpg,13
Real Estate,Where Old Curiosity Shops Abounded,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/realestate/the-quirky-retail-history-of-new-yorks-east-57th-street.html,"Just when did we let 57th Street slip out of our hands? I mean the fashionable address that had room for the funny little shop, the offbeat bookstore, the aged brownstone, the fragment of a mansion? It is hard to put a finger on any particular new development that crossed the line, but one disappearance sums up for me the long-lost magic of the street.

In the early 1960s, when I went to the Browning School on 62nd off Madison, I often walked along East 57th Street on the way home. East 57th Street, indeed much of Midtown Manhattan, was then a refuge for peculiar little buildings and odd businesses, like George Wittenborn's rowhouse store of vintage art books between Madison and Park. But the strangest of all was one block east, the little piece of medieval England Arthur Todhunter built in 1926 at 119 East 57th Street.

Born in Herefordshire, England, in 1887, Todhunter was from a family of antiques dealers whose clients were said to have included a Russian emperor and an English queen.

He came to New York in 1909 and at first imported mantelpieces and entire rooms. But around 1920 he shifted to reproduction iron pieces and woodwork, with a factory turning out weather vanes, hinges and paneling. A catalog from the 1920s offered a sundial called the Priory, described as based on an original from 1679 found on the ""south buttress of Bolton Abbey"" in Yorkshire.","Fifty years ago, East 57th Street was a refuge for peculiar little buildings and odd businesses like the Todhunter shop.",e9213c96-e65d-566d-a766-8294aacf9a51,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/29/realestate/29scapes2/29scapes2-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=2194dbcff6c7afeef453e9f4d66274a2634b4f1c0f5ec90f8e509b33a8d1554b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"The Todhunter store, at 119 East 57th Street, was recessed to allow more space for window displays; note the reproduction hardware on view in the showcase.

Technology,"How The Babylon Bee, a Right-Wing Satire Site, Capitalizes on Confusion",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/technology/babylon-bee.html,"On Friday, President Trump tweeted a story from an unusual source: The Babylon Bee, a right-wing satire site that is often described as a conservative version of The Onion. ""Twitter Shuts Down Entire Network to Slow Spread of Negative Biden News,"" read the story's headline. The story was a joke, but it was unclear whether Mr. Trump knew that when he shared the link, with the comment ""Wow, this has never been done in history.""

I chatted with Ms. Goldberg about her article, The Babylon Bee's habit of skirting the line between misinformation and satire, and how it capitalizes on its audience's confusion. So, Emma, you wrote about The Babylon Bee, a satirical news site I've been fascinated by for a long time. It's basically the right-wing version of The Onion, right? Exactly. And what fascinated me in reporting this is that I've followed The Onion for a long time -- but The Babylon Bee currently gets more traffic than them, at least according to their internal numbers. That's so interesting! (As an aside, I'm looking at some engagement data from Facebook now, and it's telling me that The Babylon Bee has gotten about 45 million interactions with its Facebook page in the last year, compared with 35 million for The Onion.) Why do you think The Bee is doing so well? Well, they certainly don't pull any punches. Their mantra seems to be that everything is fair game: the left, the right, Trump. And in general, on the right, swiping at Trump is considered a red line, but The Bee doesn't seem to care.

They've also tapped into a large audience of people who aren't hard-line Trumpers, but are much more pissed off by the outrage that Trump generates on the left. Right, sort of the anti-anti-Trump crowd. And the people who run the site, are they pro-Trump? What do they see themselves as doing, within the larger conservative movement? They are ambivalent about their views on Trump, but they also proudly identify as Christian conservatives. But I noticed that their early coverage of Trump, back in 2016, was much more vitriolic than today's. They called him a psychopath, or a megalomaniac. Now they're more bemused by him and the ghoulish ways he's described on the left. But I think their willingness to swipe at him, even gently, gets at an important element for successful humor. What media scholar Brian Rosenwald told me is that the humor always has to come before the politics. So this is a blog about distortions and misinformation, and one thing I've noticed recently is that a lot of The Babylon Bee's most successful articles in terms of online engagement are the ones that are ... less obviously satirical. Totally. And that's landed them in some hot water. Like, one from the other day was called ""NBA Players Wear Special Lace Collars to Honor Ruth Bader Ginsburg."" People were sharing that thinking it was real. They certainly play to that for virality -- their best content is right on the reality-satire line.

I'm wondering the extent to which being a satire site -- which makes them exempt from Facebook's fact-checking program -- has allowed them to traffic in misinformation under the guise of comedy. Do you think that's a deliberate strategy? Well, that's a great question, because it's been a big source of controversy for them. They've had a few articles that were fact-checked by Snopes and rated ""false."" Which The Bee's writers and editors claim prompted Facebook to threaten them with being demonetized (Facebook denies this). The Bee's founder, Adam Ford, has claimed that Snopes fact-checked them in ways that were ""egregious,"" with standards that wouldn't be applied to, for example, The Onion. The Bee feels that they're being targeted unfairly. But Snopes has poked at the fact that their pieces can sometimes be easily mistaken for real news -- which might fall on them, not their readers. Politics aside, it sort of speaks to the impossible nature of being a satirical site in the age of the mega-platform. Because on one hand, you've got to write things that are so obviously made up that they can't reasonably be mistaken for real news, but also close enough to the truth to be funny. One hundred percent. Truth is funnier than fiction these days. One thing I've wondered is what the whole ""owning the libs"" media industrial complex (which I'd categorize The Bee as belonging to, even if they wouldn't) will do if Trump loses in November. Do you get the sense that The Bee cares who wins the election, from the standpoint of comedic potential? What's funny is that because they aren't Trump loyalists, they can see an advantage for their comedy either way. In some senses, comedy comes a lot easier when you're not the party in power. But on the other hand, Trump is such an absurd figure that he can lend himself to some really wild caricatures. The editor in chief of The Bee told me Trump is great for comedy, so he'd be happy to see him win -- a little later, he added that maybe they're sick of Trump humor and ready for a change. They also see a lot of humor opportunity in the Biden camp, especially playing off the ""Sleepy Joe"" motif. So what I'm taking from this conversation is: The Babylon Bee is not a covert disinformation operation disguised as a right-wing satire site, and is in fact trying to do comedy, but may inadvertently be spreading bad information when people take their stories too seriously?

Art & Design,Andrew Cuomo Ascends to the Mountaintop With His Pandemic Poster,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/arts/design/cuomo-covid-poster-new-york.html,"Mao Zedong wrote poetry. Bill Clinton played saxophone. Winston Churchill and George W. Bush both turned to painting. For some politicians, only art can calm the passions after a long day -- and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, now steering New York to a cautious reopening after the deaths of 32,000 citizens, has lately taken solace in the discipline of graphic design. ""What if somebody said, 'OK, no words? Paint me a picture that tells the story of what you're trying to say,' "" Mr. Cuomo asked himself Monday. Depicting his response to the coronavirus outbreak in images was ""like a relief valve,"" he went on; ""I could go and just use a different side of my brain."" Do bear in mind the governor's admission that he relied on a less exercised lobe when you examine his new poster -- his second this year -- bearing the slogan ""New York Tough."" This synthesis of the state's coronavirus ordeal, on whose themes the governor expatiated during a New York City news conference, appears like a lysergic imitation of a Victorian public reform campaign -- translating the nightmare of the pandemic into an equally nightmarish vision of an island mountain, festooned with icons of death and decline, overlaid with text flying in every direction.

The virus arrives via a propeller plane, its wings scrawled with ""EUROPEANS"" and ""COVID-19,"" soaring to the mountain of death through clouds labeled ""WH TASK FORCE"" and ""FED CLOUDS OF CONFUSION."" Incoming: the virus arrives from across the Atlantic in a propeller plane. The president, identified by his overlength red tie, sits idle on a crescent moon, under the label ""It's just the flu."" The sun appears as a ""Teletubbies""-vintage ball of smiling daylight, with the president in the crest of the moon, like a Ziegfeld Follies revue. A disembodied nose gets a swab, a surgical mask floats near the summit, prisoner-bottled hand sanitizer stands at the ready. Remember the plan for a synchronized, cross-state reopening? It gets immortalized at the top of the mountain.

New Rochelle, the first viral cluster, appears like a flame emoji. To the poster's right (a little strange, this), a crew of rappellers hold a rope to slow the rate of infection, though they do not dam up the cascading waterfall on which dollar signs plunge to the sea. (Mr. Cuomo, at his news conference: ""Get it? Economy Falls, like Niagara Falls?"") The health care workers and Mr. Cuomo's children are presented at the same scale. Upon Death Mountain appear various telltale emblems of the health emergency: New Rochelle, site of the state's first infection cluster, has been rendered as a generic flame, next to a little ""Sorry We're Closed"" clip art. Up at the peak, at what is meant to signify the moment of maximum fatality in the State of New York, is a breezy rainbow, topped by a ribbon emblazoned with the motto ""Love Wins."" Mr. Cuomo is fond of this L.G.B.T. rights bumper-sticker slogan, but perhaps it should not adorn a summit denoting the acme of New York's suffering.

Your average TikTok video displays more careful graphic execution than this, though I suppose the poster's designer means with these many captions to echo the dense information of a 19th-century political campaign advertisement. Also seemingly borrowed from the late 19th century is a gross Orientalist stereotype: a zephyr at the poster's left, labeled ""Winds of Fear,"" has outrageously been given the horns and flamelike eyebrows of a Chinese demon. As a work of political propaganda, this poster gets at least one job done: the federal government bears all the blame, the State of New York is diligent and triumphant. As a work of graphic design, well, it certainly stands apart from either the high-contrast progressivism that Shepard Fairey masterminded for Barack Obama's 2008 campaign or the all-over-the-shop digital effluvia of Donald J. Trump's Twitter account. It scores very high on curiosity, and rather lower on legibility. You might think of those illustrated old-timey History of the World charts that once adorned schoolrooms, or perhaps an old promotion for a dinner-theater production of ""The Sound of Music.""

Really, the poster's nostalgic style is belated even so far as retro trends go -- hasn't it been a decade since bars in Brooklyn were flooded with ""heritage hipsters,"" drinking moonshine while wearing vintage tweeds and waxed mustaches? Yet Mr. Cuomo has an abiding taste for circa-1900 political imagery: at his news conference he shouted out William Jennings Bryan's campaign posters as a particular inspiration. Mr. Cuomo cited a poster for William Jennings Bryan, unsuccessful candidate for president in three elections, as an inspiration. ""I love history, I love poster art,"" he said. In the past Mr. Cuomo has collaborated with a designer named Rusty Zimmerman, who earlier this year drew a far superior poster for the governor that pictured New York as a trusty schooner plowing through ""the sea of division"" and ""the squalls of hate.""

This time the governor sketched out a design that was executed by another artist, whose name the governor's spokespeople were unable to provide. At this point we ought to name the designer of this poster as Andrew Cuomo himself, directing production like Rubens in his studio, or Jeff Koons in his factory. Indeed, amid the most severe state crisis in decades, the governor has nourished his deep-running creative streak, whether in his graphically inventive PowerPoint presentations, where word and image jostle against one another as discordantly as in a W.G. Sebald novel, or else in his unexpected display, during the mortal month of April, of a quilt made of hundreds of cloth face masks.

""I am an artist,"" the governor announced last month when he unveiled another surreal artwork: a human-scale mountain that aimed to depict the quick climb and gradual fall in Covid-19 cases across New York. Like a high school science project, this three-dimensional precipice of infection had a certain bizarre power, with its transubstantiation of public misery into Styrofoam. (I do hope the sculptor Rachel Harrison, whose astute conjunctions of lumpish forms and out-there imagery filled the Whitney Museum last year, has been watching.) If you know your Renaissance painting, you won't need long to identify the symbol of the giant mountain rising from the sea in this week's poster. The mountain is Purgatory, and it is a place of suffering and maturation, where the pilgrim must pass through successive trials on the way to paradise -- here known as ""The Sun on the Other Side.""

Even if the health crisis is not over (a sign at the mountain's foot reads ""Caution Ahead""), our pilgrim has been purified by his agony on the mount, guided through his ordeals by fellow New Yorkers, health care workers, and his equally prominent daughters and Siberian-shepherd dog. The mountain in the sea is a place where, as Dante had it, ""the human spirit is purged, and becomes fit to climb to Heaven."" Perhaps that is how Mr. Cuomo, as artist rather than public official, sees our ongoing ordeal: a political purgatory whose tests have molded him into a public-health paladin. But even if your pride is as big as the Adirondack Mountains, you don't need to exult with kitsch like this.","The retro political artwork on ""New York Tough"" is peak Cuomo, summing up the state's battle against the coronavirus.

Opinion,What's at Stake for Shinzo Abe's Successor,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/opinion/shinzo-abe-japan.html,"The abrupt departure of a strong and long-serving leader is always a time of both anxiety and hope. The comforts of stability and familiarity are shaken, but there is the potential to right wrongs and breathe new life into the nation. Shinzo Abe's unexpected announcement on Friday that he was stepping down after two stints as Japan's prime minister, totaling eight and a half years, is just such a moment.

Mr. Abe's greatest achievement was to bring stability to a government that had known seven prime ministers in seven years before him, and he used his firm control over the governing Liberal Democratic Party to begin a number of critically needed economic and social reforms. He put in place aggressive expansionary economic policies -- referred to as Abenomics -- that initially helped propel growth, employment and corporate earnings. He challenged how Japan did business, expanding the participation of women and immigrants in a deeply conservative society and shaking up the nation's hidebound boardroom culture.

Mr. Abe advanced the notion that Japan needed to be a ""normal country"" by taking more responsibility for its own defense and signing free-trade deals with the European Union and the countries that remained in the Trans-Pacific Partnership after President Trump withdrew the United States. He consistently stressed the need to rein in North Korea. He also somehow managed to be one of the few foreign democratic leaders to maintain something of a rapport with Mr. Trump, thus keeping -- in the words of an editorial in The Japan Times -- ""a tempestuous Donald Trump from wreaking too much havoc on the Japan-U.S. relationship.""

Yet by the time Mr. Abe stepped down, citing the same chronic disease that curtailed his first short-lived stint as prime minister in 2007, the coronavirus pandemic had largely wiped out the achievements of Abenomics, and his approval ratings were at one of their lowest points since his current term began in December 2012. His efforts to alter Japan's deeply entrenched ways had made only a partial dent.",Can Japan's next leader build on his predecessor's legacy?,ec827fe7-f624-584c-b3c4-0c882ba566b3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/02/opinion/02japanWeb/02japanWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=919d952018d27cb0b2b010213d1e6212b122cda7bcb87692127a7d46d4add2ed&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Shinzo Abe is stepping down after eight and a half years as Japan's prime minister.,ec827fe7-f624-584c-b3c4-0c882ba566b3,N24News/imgs/ec827fe7-f624-584c-b3c4-0c882ba566b3.jpg,11
Art & Design,"'The Sky Is a Great Space,' and It's the Limit for Marisa Merz",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/arts/design/the-sky-is-a-great-space-and-its-the-limit-for-marisa-merz.html,"The Met Breuer's fascinating and tenacious survey of the Italian artist Marisa Merz reveals her at 90 to be the queen of Arte Povera, the postwar Italian movement that favored sculptures and installations fashioned from humble, often discarded materials. And she's nobody's consort. ""Marisa Merz: The Sky Is a Great Space"" explores a 50-year career, belatedly lifting Ms. Merz from the edges of this all-male trend -- whose advocates did not always include her in its first, reputation-building exhibitions in the late 1960s and early '70s -- to its throne.

The assembled works suggest that Ms. Merz's relationship to Arte Povera is similar to the American painter Lee Krasner's connection to Abstract Expressionism. They were both marginalized for being women, a condition intensified by being married to one of the movement's most prominent members. (Ms. Merz's spouse, Mario Merz, who died in 2003, was especially competitive and demanding. She devoted a great deal of time to his career, and he did not reciprocate.)

The difference is that Ms. Merz's work is actually better than her husband's. Krasner, whose achievement includes some great paintings and certainly deserves more attention than it initially received, will always be in Jackson Pollock's shadow, like most other Abstract Expressionists. This exhibition proposes that -- with a few notable exceptions, including Jannis Kounellis and Alighiero Boetti -- Arte Povera may turn out to dwell largely in Ms. Merz's shadow.

Ms. Merz, who continues to work in her Turin studio, has remained truer to the movement's vow of poverty, opting for copper wire, paraffin, scraps of wood and cardboard throughout her career (although she does have a penchant for gold leaf). She seldom resorts to outside fabrication, with its aura of expense, except for the plain iron pedestals that hold many of her small heads of unfired clay. Otherwise, she prefers to keep her hand in, making everything herself. Another boon is her devotion to drawing, which wends through her habitual mixing of mediums, giving this exhibition a sense of fullness and intimacy that few in her cohort can muster. The show looks great, the first completely confident effort in the Marcel Breuer landmark since the Met took it over from the Whitney Museum barely a year ago. On view are more than 100 works, including a few often-delicate installation pieces that represent the large sprawling ones (mostly lost) that dominated the early years of her career.

The exhibition was initiated by Connie Butler and the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, where she is chief curator, and organized jointly with the Met and Ian Alteveer, its curator in the department of modern and contemporary art. It reveals an artist unafraid of incorporating crafts into her work and unintimidated either by scale or personal emotion.

The show opens with a series of immense hanging sculptures made in 1966 in her Turin kitchen (soon to overtake the family's apartment). They are fashioned from thin sheets of shiny aluminum that she more or less treats as fabric, cutting them into fringelike strips, arranging them in poufs, flounces or swags that can suggest fancy ball gowns hung up for the night, while also conjuring automobiles and assembly lines. Some are spray painted with green and red flowers that evoke Andy Warhol. The most impressive is a large piece hugging the ceiling like a heavy silver cloud, dangling immense blooms and stamen in a startling synthesis (to American eyes) of John Chamberlain, Lynda Benglis and Dale Chihuly.

The domestic-industrial duality continues on a smaller scale in the exhibition's largest gallery, where many pieces, dating from late 1960s and 1970s, incorporate little squares and triangles Ms. Merz knitted from copper wire. Delicate and gleaming, these are nailed to walls, evoking boxy little stars, or to found objects (an ancient door, a stool) forming quilt-like patterns and padding. Small sculptures knitted from either wire or nylon thread resemble primitive slippers, bowls or toy boats that might have been excavated from an archaeological site. Ms. Merz also made ""Bea,"" knitting her daughter's name in soft, cloudlike letters that have a touching vulnerability, their knitting needles still attached.

By the late 1970s, Ms. Merz was turning more and more to the female face in paintings, drawings and many of the small heads of unfired clay. But the wire is a continuing presence, an undercurrent of refinement but also protection. Sometimes it stretches across paintings like rays of light. And many of the smaller drawings have filigree patterns that almost seem knitted. Some sculpted heads, and even a few paintings, wear squares of knitted wire that could be a veil or armor befitting Joan of Arc, while others are often exquisitely blushed with layers of pastel, paint and paraffin. These faces often tilt upward as if seeking a higher spirit. Several grouped on a large plane of paraffin might almost be mourners at the base of the cross. It is in the two-dimensional works that another of Ms. Merz's strengths emerges: She has no anxiety about showing her influences, and she is known for leaving many works undated, which indicates a striking indifference to the rankings and lineages of art history. She pillages but also suavely synthesizes art's eternal images of women from the Renaissance to Futurism and beyond: from Madonnas, angels and queens to warriors. In the case of several large, especially powerful drawings in graphite, faces seem to emerge from the arches and buttresses of complex Piranesian structures. And there appear to be popular sources, too -- fashion illustration and screen-goddess publicity shots -- for the big dreamy eyes and full lips that compete with the scabrous surfaces. This is most powerfully apparent in a large, square pastel on paper of deep blue dotted with coins, pushpins and layered paraffin: A gorgeous face floats forward as if from a dream. Ms. Merz's women are often beautiful, if not regal, but her mixes of materials and objects always look provisional; the works almost inevitably refuse to look finished. They evince an artist set on exacting what might be characterized as one woman's revenge on the male gaze while refusing to settle on what, physically, beauty in art should be. This tension leaves us with an unforgettable inspiration: Ms. Merz celebrating her gender with a restless, resolute fierceness.","This exhibition at the Met Breuer explores a 50-year career, belatedly lifting Ms. Merz from the fringes of Arte Povera to its throne.",265545d1-1037-5bfb-847f-340883a02549,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/27/arts/27MERZ1/27MERZ1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=70badeae4c1c11a6c2a94af280676d184f2c32cc727f46fcafb3112896ea81b2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Two untitled sculptures and a 1984 painting by Marisa Merz on view at the Met Breuer in the exhibition ""Marisa Merz: The Sky Is a Great Space.""",265545d1-1037-5bfb-847f-340883a02549,N24News/imgs/265545d1-1037-5bfb-847f-340883a02549.jpg,14
Style,Melania Trump's Say-Nothing State Dinner Dress,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/21/style/melania-trump-dress-state-dinner.html,"The J. Mendel dress is no longer available, but Bergdorf's sold it this year. Reportedly it cost about $6,000, which is pricey, but on the scale of expensive dresses, not so much (the Chanel frock, which was couture, probably cost about four times that, at least).

It was chosen because the shade went well with the rose garden, as well as the night's decor, which was green and gold to reflect the state colors of Australia. No deeper reason.

While her office fulsomely described the reasoning behind the flowers and the meal (""The menu for the State Dinner with Australia highlights the lush, late summer season across the vast lands of America. The menu pays homage to Australia's special blend of culinary adaptations from its various cultures, not unlike the diverse food traditions of the United States""), when it came to the dress, it simply offered the designer and a description.

""Melania Trump Makes Waves,"" read the headline in USA Today. But she didn't. Not at all. Maybe she decided to leave all that roiling of the waters to her husband.

And maybe that should be enough. Maybe the fact that the first lady shows up, does her job with decorum, and looks impeccable, is all we should ask from this particular nonelected position. Her husband wore his usual tux, jacket flapping open. Mr. Morrison buttoned his. Mrs. Morrison wore two looks from the Australian designer Carla Zampatti: a black dress on arrival and a halter-necked sequined navy column with a silk scarf to the dinner.

And yet there's something dispiriting about the idea that at one of the grandest public occasions orchestrated by the White House, and managed largely by the East Wing -- one full of pomp and circumstance and staging -- the costume of the leading lady should be hailed as successful because ... it's pretty.","Her dress at the Australian state dinner wasn't just understated, it was an absence of statement.",d0274569-319b-5137-bd6e-a435b9fe62b9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/21/fashion/21Melania-dress-1/21Melania-dress-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=f6880ef286ac7d16fd89337f74ec2e934ab867508cf1469c015264fbd9a8f6d0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"President Trump and Melania Trump (wearing a J.

Automobiles,A Priority of Cornering Over Horsepower,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/automobiles/autoreviews/a-priority-of-cornering-over-horsepower.html,"WHAT IS IT? A midengine four-seat Lotus, fortified with a supercharger. HOW MUCH? $78,895 base, $89,745 as tested, including the sport premium package ($3,250), Technology package ($3,100) and forged wheels ($2,750). WHAT'S UNDER THE HOOD? A Toyota-based 3.5-liter V-6 (345 horsepower, 295 pound feet of torque) and a 6-speed manual transmission; a 6-speed automatic arrives in the Evora S for 2013. IS IT THIRSTY? Not for a car that does 178 m.p.h. The Evora S is rated at 17 m.p.g. city and 26 m.p.g. highway by the Environmental Protection Agency. MOST sports cars are engine-centric, their personalities defined by what's under the hood. A Ferrari 458 Italia is a multitalented machine, but its dominant note is delivered by the yowling V-8 behind the seats. The Porsche 911 has its grumbling, keening boxer-6. A Corvette wouldn't be the same without the bellow of a big Chevy V-8.

And the Lotus Evora, well, that has an engine of some sort. It must be in there somewhere, right? The British-built Evora uses a Japanese-engineered 3.5-liter V-6, a workmanlike device that powers millions of Toyota Camry sedans, Highlander crossovers and Sienna minivans. The S version of the Evora upgrades the base 276-horsepower V-6 with a Harrop HTV 1320 supercharger, raising its output to 345 horsepower. The exhaust system of the S gets a bypass valve that can be activated by the Sport button on the dashboard, letting the full voice of the engine's combustion process express itself in decidedly visceral -- and un-Camrylike -- terms. Acceleration is strong (0-60 in 4.3 seconds, according to Lotus) and the sprint is accompanied by a faint whistle of exertion from the supercharger. For the soundtrack alone, the Evora S is a worthy upgrade over the nonsupercharged car. Still, the engine is a mere supporting actor in the Evora script. You get the idea that the V-6 is there in service of the chassis, to get it rolling fast enough for you to realize what a Lotus is all about. Lotus is such a handling-first company that its engineers would happily design gravity-powered Soap Box Derby racers if they could turn a profit. There's a road near my house that I've driven hundreds of times, but I never noticed its texture until I drove it in the Evora S. Suddenly the grain of the pavement boiled up through the seat, the steering wheel and even the pedals. It isn't an unpleasant sensation, which is the genius of Lotus chassis tuning -- the Evora manages to deliver a comfortable ride while providing ridiculous levels of feedback and some big-league performance numbers (like more than 1 G of grip on the skid pad).

How deep is Lotus's obsession with handling? Well, the Evora S press materials note that relative to the nonsupercharged Evora, this car uses a larger-diameter rear antiroll bar -- a whole half-millimeter larger. That's the kind of difference that used to be ascribed to manufacturing tolerances. When you're parsing half-millimeters on your antiroll bars, off-the-shelf tires won't do. The optional Pirelli P-Zero Corsa tires (235/35R19 front, 275/30R20 rear) were produced just for this car. It might be prudent to hoard an extra set. The Evora S is fast, gorgeous inside and out, and it's competitively priced with its obvious rival, the Porsche 911. The car has the presence of a true exotic. But with that small-batch flavor and exclusivity come a few foibles; it turns out that the Acura NSX, the first supercar to offer every-day levels of comfort, did not convince every other maker of high-end sports cars that ergonomic sensibility was achievable. The Evora makes it clear why midengine cars with 2+2 seating are so rare these days. With the V-6 and vestigial back seats claiming their share of the Evora's pert 101-inch wheelbase, the front seats are pushed forward toward the front wheels. You have a panoramic view through the windshield, but you're seated so far forward that the housing for the front wheel balloons into the space to the left of the clutch pedal. Normally, this spot is where you'd have a dead pedal, the fixed perch where you rest your left foot. And the Evora S does have a dead pedal, technically. But it's such a meager tranche of real estate that even Nik Wallenda's foot would slip off after a minute or two. You end up driving with your foot on the floor beneath the clutch pedal, slowly losing the battle to obdormition. The car I drove also had a nonfunctioning cruise control system, meaning that my right foot was always busy, too. When I needed to do a four-hour highway slog, I left the Lotus at home. It's the wrong tool for that job. On a great road, there are few cars that are more rewarding than an Evora S. But we're in the era of the no-compromises sports car, when machines more extreme than this are expected to deliver both scorching performance and everyday usability. While the Evora is a veritable day spa compared with the Elise and Exige -- as of the 2012 model year, these Lotus models are no longer imported to the United States -- it's still a car built around the idea that you're always driving just for the fun of it. It's a beautiful worldview. If only it were true.","The 345-horsepower engine is a mere supporting actor in the Evora S. The main strength of this car is how it handles, because Lotus is a handling-first company.",28afe6ab-57ac-5943-a82c-90a7c908991f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/08/05/automobiles/05BLOC/05BLOC-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=316&w=600&s=b59e36c735558053f2b8e0c19b8ca5613ebe5f8e404788646f5139ea198b5d60&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"EMPOWERED The V-6 engine of the Evora S comes from Toyota, but a supercharger pumps it up to 345 horsepower.",28afe6ab-57ac-5943-a82c-90a7c908991f,N24News/imgs/28afe6ab-57ac-5943-a82c-90a7c908991f.jpg,23
Theater,5 Must-See Shows if You're in New York This Month,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/theater/must-see-shows-if-youre-in-new-york-this-month.html,"Yes, it's August, in all its fire and fetor, and maybe you'd rather be at the beach. But new productions opening in New York this month offer consolation and stimulation (and essential air-conditioning) to those staying in the city. They include sharp-minded considerations of matters political, from Suzan-Lori Parks and the multifarious Michael Moore; an anthology of Broadway musical hits from a master of the genre, Harold Prince; and New York premieres from the empathetic Simon Stephens and the caustic Bruce Norris.

THE TERMS OF MY SURRENDER Michael Moore, who predicted the victory of our incumbent president, makes his Broadway debut to assess the consequences of that prophecy fulfilled in these not-so-United States. This polymathic documentary filmmaker (""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" ""Sicko"") and author (""Dude, Where's My Country?"") is turning the Belasco Theater into a one-man bully pulpit for his distinctive gospel of All-American dissent. This being New York City, he may be mostly preaching to the choir. But Mr. Moore tends to tripwire his own sermons in ways guaranteed to provoke thought, laughter and red-blooded rage. Michael Mayer (""Spring Awakening,"" ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"") directs.

PRINCE OF BROADWAY A colossus of the musical theater since the 1950s, Harold Prince returns to the Times Square neighborhood, where his name is a byword for both innovation and razzle-dazzle. This animated scrapbook of a Tony Award-laden career features numbers from the Olympian classics on which Mr. Prince served as a producer or director: ""West Side Story,"" ""Fiddler on the Roof,"" ""Cabaret,"" ""Follies"" and ""Sweeney Todd,"" for starters. As might be expected, Mr. Prince has assembled a caviar team for this Manhattan Theater Club production, including the choreographer Susan Stroman, who co-directed with Mr. Prince, and, as musical supervisor and arranger, the composer Jason Robert Brown.

A PARALLELOGRAM Who knows what evil -- and festering discontent and bad faith -- lurks in the hearts of men and women? Bruce Norris does. He's the corrosive dramatist who has regularly peered (and poked) under the rocks of American hypocrisy with plays like ""The Pain and the Itch"" and the Pulitzer Prize-winning ""Clybourne Park,"" which riffed -- without hope but with great wit and inventiveness -- on the watershed Lorraine Hansberry play, ""A Raisin in the Sun."" His ""A Parallelogram,"" directed by Michael Greif (""Dear Evan Hansen"") for Second Stage, follows one woman's dialogue between her present and future selves. A bright tomorrow is unlikely to be in the forecast. The cast includes Celia Keenan-Bolger, Anita Gillette and Stephen Kunken.

THE RED LETTER PLAYS In the late 20th century, the peerlessly intrepid dramatist Suzan-Lori Parks revisited Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter,"" that great 19th-century novel of Puritan guilt, to consider the stigmas with which African-American women have been branded. Ms. Parker has an expansive and thrillingly original imagination, and her riposte to ""The Scarlet Letter"" required two plays, both featuring a central character named for Hawthorne's ill-used Hester: ""In the Blood"" and ""A,"" whose full title includes an unprintable epithet. Now the Signature Theater Company is reviving these works in tandem, with new productions directed by Sarah Benson (""In the Blood"") and Jo Bonney (""A""). You are sure to be reminded that no one writes American history -- or rewrites its cultural cliches -- like Ms. Parks, who won a Pulitzer Prize for ""Topdog/Underdog.""

ON THE SHORE OF THE WIDE WORLD The British playwright Simon Stephens has become one of the theater's most poignant chroniclers of everyday lives in upheaval. Best known for his Tony-winning adaptation of Mark Haddon's ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,"" Mr. Stephens has also written a series of quieter, diamond-faceted dramas in which static existences are shaken and stirred into new forms, including the smashing two-character ""Heisenberg,"" seen on Broadway last season with Mary-Louise Parker and Denis Arndt. Now the Atlantic Theater Company, which gave us a fine production of Mr. Stephens's ""Harper Regan"" in 2012, presents the New York premiere of his ""On the Shore of the Wide World,"" a delicately drawn map of roads not taken by three generations of a family in Mr. Stephens's native Stockport, England.","Political plays by Suzan-Lori Parks and Michael Moore, Harold Prince's hit anthology and New York premieres from Simon Stephens and Bruce Norris.",2fdf1991-9688-597a-95f0-6f5083342801,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/01/theater/01mustsee-para/01mustsee-para-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=7ef7c9396bb6b99421bc9124582d19b018976372d7223aa653b28baf9f652375&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Celia Keenan-Bolger in ""A Parallelogram.""",2fdf1991-9688-597a-95f0-6f5083342801,N24News/imgs/2fdf1991-9688-597a-95f0-6f5083342801.jpg,10
Media,Rolling Stone Settles Lawsuit Over Debunked Campus Rape Article,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/business/media/rolling-stone-university-virginia-rape-story-settlement.html,"Rolling Stone and a writer have agreed to settle a libel suit brought by a University of Virginia administrator over a debunked article that described a gang rape at the university, the magazine announced on Tuesday.

The administrator, Nicole P. Eramo, asserted that the discredited November 2014 article defamed her and portrayed her as the ""chief villain,"" indifferent to sexual assault on campus. Last November, a federal jury awarded her $3 million in damages, which the magazine and the article's writer, Sabrina Rubin Erdely, appealed.

But lawyers for Ms. Eramo filed a notice in Federal District Court in Virginia on Tuesday that she was dropping the suit. ""We are delighted that this dispute is now behind us, as it allows Nicole to move on and focus on doing what she does best, which is supporting victims of sexual assault,"" Libby Locke, one of her lawyers, said in a statement.

A spokeswoman for Wenner Media, the parent company of Rolling Stone, said: ""Rolling Stone, Sabrina Rubin Erdely and Nicole Eramo have come to an amicable resolution. The terms are confidential.""","The magazine settled with a University of Virginia administrator who had said the retracted November 2014 article portrayed her as the ""chief villain.""",89dfba08-14f2-5a40-9add-d3a223892be2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/12/us/12xp-rollingstone/12xp-rollingstone-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=a95d07a1cabbcd57578d01d882a926d62ad0b9fbdc192271c04152746104f69b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Nicole P.

Travel,Walk Past Those Limp Salads: Real Food Is Now Available by Gate 6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/travel/good-airport-food-tartine-rick-bayless.html,"Airport food has long conjured images of limp, overpriced Caesar salads and refrigerator-case turkey wraps. But as terminals across the country modernize, and the demand for local food grows, the number of destination-worthy airport outposts offering food you'll want to eat has been steadily growing. The most recent example opened in January. The Manufactory Food Hall at San Francisco International Airport now offers fast-casual representations of cuisine from four notable local chefs and bakers: Pim Techamuanvivit of Thai restaurant Kin Khao, Gabriela Camara of Cala, and Elisabeth Prueitt and Chad Robertson of Tartine Bakery. Instead of soggy french fries and overcooked burgers, travelers in the International Terminal can order sandwiches on Tartine bread, gluten-free Thai fried chicken boxes and curry soups, and Mexico City-style tacos. The hall also features freshly baked pastries, Tartine's coffee and a full bar. ""When we were first approached about this, my knee-jerk reaction was, 'Never!'"" said Ms. Prueitt, citing concerns about quality control. ""But I started thinking about who we could collaborate with, how we could effectively translate our food to this environment. That made it a much more interesting venture.""

Opening a restaurant anywhere is difficult. Opening in the airport is a whole new level of hard: Unfamiliar security systems and supply chains, concern over operational control and the fear of brand misrepresentation are just the immediate hurdles. But the potential for such exposure -- from a captive and hungry audience, no less -- along with a new willingness of airport food service operators to meet chefs' demands has made the prospect more appealing.

For Ms. Prueitt, the chance to work with other local chefs made the proposition realistic and exciting. All of the chefs operate out of Tartine's San Francisco commissary kitchen, butchering, slow-roasting and fermenting their goods before delivering them to the airport. Ms. Prueitt makes weekly visits to catch up with staff and personally taste everything. When Rick Bayless opened Tortas Frontera in Chicago's O'Hare International Airport in 2011, it meant giving up a good amount of control. The vast majority of airport restaurants domestically are run by third-party operators and staffed by their employees; the Manufactory is run by SSP, while Tortas Frontera's three O'Hare locations are under the purview HMSHost. For chefs, that means a different kind of oversight is required. ""We have two full-time employees in our organization that go to every one of the places in the airport, twice a week, and make sure that everything is up to our standards,"" says Mr. Bayless. ""That's how we're successful -- we commit the labor to it."" That commitment, and willingness to work with airport-specific challenges, is necessary. Employees require security badges to get to work. Deliveries follow a tight schedule; chefs can't decide, on a whim, that they'd like a certain product.

However, operators have become more agile to chef demands (Mr. Bayless, for example, wanted to use ingredients from his favorite purveyors), and have built up their own infrastructures as this demand and interest has grown. HMSHost established a partnership with the James Beard Foundation and has built out its own chef staff, said Stephanie Havard, executive vice president of restaurant development. ""We've been hiring people from streetside restaurants that are very connected to the culinary world,"" Ms. Havard says of their expansion. ""We now have an operations team of more than 30 chefs who have worked with everyone from Todd English to Bobby Flay. It's given us the ability to speak 'chef's speak,' and to really connect with these local chefs."" The new food destinations in San Francisco and Chicago are far from alone. A Denver favorite, Root Down, opened a location at Denver International Airport in 2013; an outpost of the Denver Central Market opened there last November. Minneapolis-Saint Paul has locations of Black Sheep Pizza, Salty Tart and Angel Food Bakery. Phoenix, along with Seattle-Tacoma and New Orleans, have terminal modernization projects underway, with new local food options planned. Portland International Airport, in addition to hosting locations of Blue Star Donuts, Kenny and Zuke's, and The Country Cat, also provides travelers a tasting room for a local distillery, Westward Whiskey, which sells tasting flights and cocktails alongside bottles for sale. ""It's been one of the most successful things we've ever done,"" says Thomas Mooney, the distillery's chief executive and co-owner. ""We have the opportunity to connect with more than 40,000 people in a really immersive way."" And some food-minded travelers will adjust their itineraries for the sake of visiting a certain restaurant. April Oed Hamilton, a food educator and writer based in Baton Rouge, La., says she flies into San Francisco, instead of the more convenient San Jose Airport, when visiting a sister who lives in Santa Cruz.

""Anything for that Tartine morning bun!"" she said. In fact, Mr. Bayless says that Tortas Frontera at O'Hare has more regular customers than his downtown restaurants. ""I swear, my tombstone is going to read, 'He Made Good Food at the Airport!'"" he said. ""People are just so happy to have good food when traveling."" We have a new 52 Places traveler!

Real Estate,"Long on Trees, Short on Costs",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/27/realestate/glen-oaks-queens-living-in-long-on-trees-short-on-costs.html,"GLEN OAKS, on the Queens border with Nassau County, is dominated by a series of co-op apartment complexes, both garden and high-rise. But it doesn't take a visitor much time to be able to reimagine this neighborhood of about 15,000 people as it must have been in previous lives -- as farmland, country estate and golf course. The most notable co-ops are Glen Oaks Village, nearly 3,000 units spread among two sections of two- and three-story brick buildings that went up after World War II, and North Shore Towers, a gated trio of 34-story high-rises dating to the early 1970s. Each sits on more than a hundred acres that once belonged to William K. Vanderbilt, and residents say the gardens and open space -- not to mention the nearby Queens County Farm Museum, a working farm -- give the area a quiet livability that is rare within the city limits. ""I call it New York City's secret community,"" said Bob Friedrich, the president of the village's co-op board, adding that from some parts of the complex, ""you can literally look out your window and see all sorts of farm animals."" Glen Oaks Village, which was built in 1947 and converted to co-ops in 1981, is focused on keeping its roughly 10,000 residents in their units for the long term, said Mr. Friedrich, in explaining why the rules governing renovations and expansions are so flexible. Owners of second-floor units are permitted to expand upward, turning attic space into a full-scale upper floor, and ground-floor owners are allowed to reclaim basement space for living quarters, he said. The board also encourages owners to build decks, terraces and separate rear entrances, partly as a way to improve property values.

""The apartments are smaller, because they were built a long time ago,"" Mr. Friedrich said, ""so by giving people the opportunity to enlarge their apartments, they stay rather than leave."" Pets are allowed, he said, and services in the complex include trash pickup six days a week and snow-shoveling in the winter. In warm weather, the board provides $24 vouchers that can be redeemed for flowers at local plant nurseries, including the farm museum. Christine and Harry Bergen, residents for 32 years, raised their son in the complex, and recently added a terrace off their kitchen. Ms. Bergen, who is on the co-op board and heads its admissions committee, says a younger generation of residents have come to enjoy the development's charms. Ms. Bergen meets most of them when they arrive, and she added, ""My committee, they always say, 'Oh, what nice people I just had.' ""

The other visually prominent complex, North Shore Towers, includes 1,844 units built starting in 1971 on the highest point in Queens, next to Grand Central Parkway. It is visible for miles. Originally rentals, the complex converted to co-ops in 1987, though there are still a few sponsor-owned rentals, and subletting is allowed. A building that connects all three towers, which residents call the ""arcade,"" has food stores, a coffee shop, a bank, a dry cleaner and a movie theater. The stores are open to the public but used mostly by residents, said Annette Kroll, a resident who has been selling apartments in the towers since the co-op conversion. The complex also has five tennis courts, indoor and outdoor pools, a health club and an 18-hole golf course. Views from high floors, Ms. Kroll said, stretch to the Manhattan skyline and the Atlantic. With all the services, she added, ""it's like going to Canyon Ranch and not spending $500 a day."" Long Island Jewish Medical Center lies at the eastern end of the 1.25-square-mile neighborhood, near the city line, and residents of the local complexes include staff members and patients. Julia Shildkret, a local broker, said North Shore Towers had gained a reputation as an elder community, though Ms. Kroll said younger residents had been arriving in recent years as well. Brian Lynn, who bought a one-bedroom last year in Parkwood Estates, a 400-unit complex next to the farm museum, said he was ""very comfortable"" in what he described as a ""nice little enclave."" With apartments making up so much of the housing, it is also relatively inexpensive. Mr. Lynn, who splits his time between Glen Oaks and his partner's place in Manhattan, said he paid $167,000 for his unit, along with $628 a month in maintenance, which covers many utilities and a parking space. Besides the self-contained developments -- Glen Oaks Village with its red bricks and white trim, Parkwood Estates with similarly scaled buildings in yellow stucco -- there are pockets of one- and two-family detached houses, mostly along Union Turnpike. With this mix, the area provides starter homes for young families, said Ms. Shildkret, who sold a previous home for Mr. Lynn.

Houses in another small subdivision -- Royal Ranch, an out-of-the way cluster near the parkway and North Shore Towers -- are among the more expensive, brokers say. That is partly because of their large, secluded lots. Residents' one big complaint, Mr. Friedrich said, is infrastructure upkeep; many curbs date to 1946. Their crumbling has caused flooding that local government has been slow to address. That said, however, Glen Oaks Village has benefited from the city's Million Trees campaign: about 300 have been planted in the complex, he said. Kathy Gibbons, the branch manager at the Bellerose office of Laffey Fine Homes, says co-ops in Glen Oaks Village generally sell for $220,000 to $290,000 -- though prices vary according to condition and the number and type of improvements. For garden units generally, Ms. Shildkret said, one-bedrooms have recently sold for $150,000 to $175,000, two-bedrooms for $180,000 to $275,000. The one three-bedroom co-op to change hands recently, she said, citing data from the local multiple listing service, sold for $265,000. Mr. Friedrich says residents generally have a keen appreciation of the affordability of their property taxes, especially when compared with those in neighboring Nassau County. Semidetached houses near Union Turnpike, Ms. Shildkret said, generally sell in the $400,000 range, detached houses closer to $500,000. But some houses can be more expensive -- up to $700,000, Ms. Gibbons said, citing the Royal Ranch area, where properties come on the market infrequently. Prices in North Shore Towers vary, Ms. Kroll said. Studios and smaller one-bedrooms sell in the $200,000 range, she said. Penthouses can exceed $1 million. (One-bedrooms top out at 1,300 square feet, two-bedrooms at 1,700 square feet and three-bedrooms about 2,000.)

The area lies within the prized School District 26, with most students zoned for Public School 186, on 72nd Avenue in Parkwood Estates. The school received an A on its most recent city progress report, with 79 percent of tested students showing mastery in English, 87.9 percent in math. No. 115, on 261st Street, serves the southern half of Glen Oaks Village; its grade was a C, with 68.4 percent proficient in English, 75.8 in math. Zoned middle schools include Junior High School 67, on Marathon Parkway, where 81.9 percent were proficient in English, 94.4 percent in math. It got an A on its most recent report card. SAT averages at the high school component of Q811 -- a kindergarten-through-Grade-12 facility on Marathon Parkway -- were 408 in reading, 428 in math and 407 in writing, versus 436, 460 and 431 citywide. Vanderbilt owned the land that is now Glen Oaks Village and North Shore Towers until his death in 1920, after which it was sold to the Glen Oaks golf club. Many early residents of Glen Oaks Village were returning veterans.",Apartments make up most of the housing stock in this Queens neighborhood built on property once owned by William K.

On Friday the company announced the cancellation of its winter and spring seasons and shared its plans to return to the David H.

The company also announced that three principals, Maria Kowroski, Ask la Cour and Gonzalo Garcia, would be retiring during the 2021-22 engagements.

Economy,Uncertain Leadership Strains Financial Overhaul,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/13/business/economy/13bank.html,"WASHINGTON -- When federal financial regulators next gather to compare notes and coordinate plans, one of the requirements of a banking law intended to prevent the next financial crisis, 5 of the 10 seats at the table will most likely be empty or filled by caretakers. The Obama administration has not announced nominees for several positions that Congress created last summer, nor has it nominated new heads for three agencies, including for an imminent vacancy at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. As a result, temporary leaders tapped by the president increasingly are responsible for the vast overhaul of financial regulations, raising concerns that their decisions will prove more vulnerable to political pressure than permanent leaders insulated by Senate confirmation to a fixed term. ""I look back on my last five years and all the tough decisions I had to make, and if I'd been in an acting capacity, it would have been very inhibiting to me in making some of the tough decisions I had to do,"" Sheila C. Bair, who in early June will complete her term as chairwoman of the F.D.I.C., told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday.

The vacancies have accumulated in part because Senate Republicans have blocked votes on nominees for a wide range of positions. The White House, in turn, has not rushed to add names to the list. In one case, it has temporarily circumvented the Senate by giving the Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren acting responsibility for a new agency focused on consumer financial protection. The White House also appointed an acting director for the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees the mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The agency has operated without a permanent head since August 2009. And since August, 2010, an acting director also has run the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees most of the nation's largest banks. A new position on the Federal Reserve Board, vice chairman for supervision, has remained vacant since it was created last summer. So has a seat on the council of regulators designated for someone with insurance expertise. Amy Brundage, a White House spokeswoman, said that President Obama would announce nominees for the positions ""as soon as possible."" ""The president is looking for strong, well-qualified candidates who can lead these institutions to protect American consumers and taxpayers, while ensuring the stability of an American economy emerging from the worst recession since the Great Depression,"" she said.

The White House soon plans to nominate a replacement for Ms. Bair at the F.D.I.C., according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because no plans had been publicly announced. The front-runner is Martin J. Gruenberg, currently the agency's vice chairman, who worked for years as a Democratic staff member on the Senate Banking Committee. A decision also is close on a nominee for comptroller of the currency, those people said. The lack of permanent leadership is a significant handicap, according to current and former regulators. It is fairly easy to keep doing the same things, but much harder to navigate unexpected difficulties or to consider new ideas. And agencies are being asked to do both of those things as perhaps never before. The sweeping overhaul of financial regulations passed into law last year requires agencies to write hundreds of rules, an unprecedented task, even as they grapple with the unfamiliar financial landscape left by the crisis. John Walsh, the acting comptroller of the currency, said that Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner had encouraged him to do the job as if it were, indeed, his job.

""But the fact is that I have said to him and have said repeatedly that I do think it's very important for independent supervisory agencies to have nominated and confirmed heads in place,"" Mr. Walsh said Thursday at the same Senate hearing. ""It's important for independence and for the perception of independence."" Senator Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, said Thursday that the absence of leadership was complicating the work of identifying ""systemically important"" financial firms that could pose a threat to the broader economy.

""We need strong nominees who will not be afraid to take bold steps to prevent a new financial crisis,"" Mr. Brown said. Senators from both parties urged regulators at a hearing Thursday to offer more detailed criteria for designating such firms, which will be subject to stricter regulation. Bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets automatically fall under the designation, according to the Dodd-Frank law approved last year. But there is no clear standard for selecting other kinds of financial firms like insurance companies, hedge funds and investment managers. Proposals issued by regulators in January ""lacked the necessary specificity that we need to understand how this process is going to unfold,"" Senator Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, said at the hearing. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, agreed. ""We've got to give some more clarity here, the sooner the better."" Regulators, racing against a January 2012 deadline to complete the work, told the committee that they agreed more details were necessary, and that they hoped to release a package of proposed rules this summer. But Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said regulators still would need to make subjective decisions in some cases. ""I don't think we can provide an exact formula that will apply mechanically without any application of judgment,"" said Mr. Bernanke who played a leading role along with Mr. Geithner in the government's bailout of certain banks and financial institutions in 2008. The difficulty of appointing regulators to make those decisions was underscored in December, when Senate Republicans blocked the nomination of Joseph A. Smith Jr., the commissioner of banking in North Carolina, to lead the housing finance agency.","As temporary leaders overhaul regulations, concerns are rising about their vulnerability to political pressure.",8ad41d5a-4bf7-5ed0-920c-86b4596382fc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/05/13/business/Bank/Bank-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=330&w=600&s=7d0d9d8e98e337df0bfbfe9b33dbd91d3459debe696b17a7ed32612e86f7d26c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"From left, Neal Wolin of the Treasury; Ben S.

Television,"'The Mandalorian' Season 2, Episode 3 Recap: Bigger Fish",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/13/arts/television/mandalorian-episode-3-recap.html,"Last week on ""The Mandalorian,"" Baby Yoda scarfed down several unfertilized frog-creature eggs, sparking arguments across the internet about whether the kid's uncontrollable impulse to have a little snack was funny or appalling. Well, this week Baby Yoda -- sealed inside his own floating metallic ""egg"" -- gets swallowed whole by a sea monster. Could this be some kind of poetic justice? I don't want to dive too deep into the ethics or the entertainment value of the Child's egg-eating in last week's chapter of ""The Mandalorian."" In my review, I called it ""hilarious."" I stand by that -- although I do understand why some people might find the joke too shocking to enjoy. But it is worth noting that the ""Star Wars"" universe is filled with species that eat other species. In ""The Mandalorian"" Season 2 premiere, a Krayt dragon consumed several Tusken Raiders -- as well as Mando himself -- before getting blown to smithereens and having its own meat distributed among the throng. In this week's episode, ""The Heiress,"" our heroes stop at a pub on the watery moon of Trask, where the proprietor serves a chowder (dispensed by what can only be called a soup hose) containing living seafood with flailing tentacles. At one point, one of those beasts leaps out of the bowl and tries to chomp the Child. Later in the episode, the Child slurps down a different one of those squirmy things. So it goes. As we've been moving further into the larger story of ""The Mandalorian,"" it's becoming clear that the series's creator and head writer, Jon Favreau, means to explore the moral gray areas of ""Star Wars"" by setting his saga at a time when the galaxy's order is very much in flux. It's hard to discern sometimes who the good guys are in this era. Who's the predator and who's the prey?

As a case-in-point, consider the new allies the Mandalorian makes this week. After the Child gets gobbled by the leviathan, Din Djarin dives into the water to save him. Just when he's about to be killed by a gang of squid-headed Quarren -- intending, like so many others, to steal his armor -- he's saved by three of his fellow Mandalorians. But there's a complication. The posse members immediately remove their helmets after the rescue, ignoring what our Mando believes are ancient, inviolable protocols. Moreover, the squad's leader, Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff), then explains that while she was fighting in the battles to liberate Mandalore, Din's order, ""the Watch,"" was arguing against social progress and pushing to reestablish the orthodox religious practices of ""the Way."" Is it possible that all this time, our Mando has been the wrong kind of Mandalorian? Hearing there might be more than one Mandalorian Way rattles Din, who rockets off with the Child ... only to encounter yet another mob of angry Quarren, necessitating yet another Bo-Katan rescue. Finally, Mando agrees to join forces with her as she and her team attempt to reclaim some stolen Mandalorian weapons from an Imperial freighter, guarded by Stormtroopers. Fervent ""Star Wars"" fans who've watched every movie and TV series -- and have maybe also read every novel and comic book and played every video game -- should recognize some of the back story and mythology described in this episode. Bo-Katan Kryze herself is a character in the animated series ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" and ""Star Wars Rebels."" (In both, she is voiced by Sackhoff). Her quest to acquire the powerful and symbolic weapon the Darksaber -- and then to lead her people to independence -- is a big part of the franchise's lore. But it's not necessary to know any of that to enjoy ""The Heiress,"" which is just as tied to the already established ""Mandalorian"" plot. The Darksaber, as you may recall, is currently in the hands of last season's main villain, Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito), who is still using it for his own nefarious purposes in the parts of the galaxy where the Empire still has some sway. Gideon appears briefly in this episode via hologram, advising the Imperial freighter's captain (played by the always terrific Titus Welliver) to do whatever he must to keep the Mandalorian raiders from seizing their weapons cache.

What follows is another outstanding ""Mandalorian"" action sequence as Din and Bo-Katan's team fight off the captain's crew in narrow corridors -- the ""Star Wars"" set designers do love their narrow corridors -- and then try to keep the captain from crashing the freighter, killing them all. In addition to being gripping, the big climactic set-piece is filled with what makes this franchise fun, including lots of moments when the reliably dim Stormtroopers don't really understand what's going on. The breathless rush of that final battle is also representative of where our Mandalorian finds himself at this point in the story. He's always been a very task-oriented bounty hunter, taking one job after another while trying his best to represent the ideals of his order. But while he has been hustling to keep the Child safe, he has also been working alongside whoever can help. Droids, Jedi, rival Mandalorians ... Din Djarin has been learning to trust some folks he might previously have considered his enemies. Sometimes ideals have to bend to circumstance. When Mando lands on Trask's moon at the start of the episode, his craft, the Razor Crest, is sputtering badly, with metal flaking off the hull. When he leaves at the end, the ship has been literally bound together by ropes and wires by the Mon Calamari mechanics he hired. (When Din complains about the staff's shoddy work, the supervisor just quietly hands him an invoice to sign. That's another fine bit of ""Mandalorian"" silent comedy.) As the Mandalorian and the Child rocket into hyperspace, more Razor Crest chunks go flying. That's because the state of the ship is similar to the state of the galaxy. Everyone is just trying to keep what they have in one piece, however possible, for as long as necessary. Survival first. Moral quandaries later.
* None This episode was directed by Bryce Dallas Howard, who also directed ""Sanctuary,"" from Season 1. That's the one in which Mando and Cara Dune (Gina Carano) fought Imperial Walkers on a muddy forest planet. Both of Howard's ""Mandalorian"" episodes so far have balanced thrilling action sequences with quieter character moments. I've started to look forward to seeing her name in the credits.
* None While Din Djarin is off adventuring on the high seas with the other Mandalorians, he leaves the Child with the Frog Lady and her husband, which seems like a recipe for disaster ... or at least for more outraged tweets from the show's more sensitive fans. Instead, Baby Yoda minds his manners as Mando had urgently requested (before adding, ""You know what I'm talking about""). The Child even seems delighted when one of the now-fertilized eggs hatches into a tadpole creature. Granted, he probably wanted to eat that, too. But he didn't! That's progress.

Sports,"The Players Are Doing It for Themselves, Not Us",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/sports/soccer/champions-league-rory-smith.html,"Enjoying this newsletter? Sign up to get it directly, every Friday, at nytimes.com/rory. Kylian Mbappe's smile was real. His Paris St.-Germain teammates had gathered in a circle around him, bouncing and dancing and celebrating their progression to the club's first Champions League final. Their numbers kept swelling as stragglers and latecomers, those who had been sidetracked by media commitments or had to make their way down from the stands, arrived. Abdou Diallo has been in Lisbon as a spectator thus far; he had not played a minute of either of P.S.G.'s games. But when he reached the circle, he sprang off a teammate's back and launched himself into the middle of the throng. His joy was real, just as Lyon's was, when its remarkable victory against Manchester City was confirmed. Just as Bayern Munich's was, as each and every goal went in against Barcelona. Just as Neymar's was, when Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting sealed P.S.G.'s place in the semifinals.

It should not need to be said that soccer loses something without fans. Of course it does: Their absence strips it of a sense of occasion, spectacle, urgency. The noise of a crowd functions, essentially, as a Greek chorus, an emotional barometer, a form of voiceless narration of events as they unfold. It tells us -- fans, distant, and players, present -- how, what and when to feel. These last three months, of games played out in stadiums, still and quiet, are not anyone's idea of how sports should be. Though a strange alternative narrative has taken hold -- in which elite soccer has chosen to do away with fans, rather than elite soccer doing the only thing it could to survive in something resembling its current form -- there is nobody, anywhere, who wants to rely on computer-generated atmosphere longer than necessary. But that is not to say that the worst fears that preceded soccer's restart in the age of coronavirus have been realized. The worry, before those first Bundesliga games were played in May, was that -- deprived of fans -- the sport itself would suffer and the ""show,"" as Arsene Wenger called it, might not survive. Games played in empty stadiums, without all of that noise and color and frenzy, would seem bland, lifeless, artificial. Soccer, as has been written before, does not have any inherent meaning; it is fans who imbue it with significance. Those fans in the stadium represent all of us; in their absence, the bond is broken. Not just between us and the team, but between action and importance. They are our ambassadors and interpreters, telling us what it all means.

It went unsaid, of course, but at the root of that concern was something that, as fans, we know but choose to ignore: Without the spectacle, soccer becomes just a game. By removing meaning, we draw back the curtain and see this global phenomenon, this multibillion-dollar industry that consumes so much of our time and our energy and our love, for what it is: 22 people we don't know, kicking a ball around. And yet that meaninglessness has not materialized. By the time Bayern Munich's eighth goal went in against Barcelona, the strangeness of the circumstances in which the game was being played -- barren stands, substitutes in face masks -- no longer even seemed relevant. What mattered was what was being played out on the field, the final demise of what was once the greatest team in the world.

That P.S.G. broke Atalanta's hearts with nobody there to watch did not diminish the drama of it; the cruelty of its two late goals was not offset, even to neutral observers, by the fact that there were not 40,000 people rubbing salt in the wounds. In the seconds after Sterling's miss, the eye was not drawn to the rows of empty seats; it was too busy trying to get a handle on the physics of what had just happened. After a while, in other words, it is the game that draws us in, not the backdrop. How much you enjoy a play or a film is not dependent on how many people are there watching it with you. Perhaps that does not apply to the mundane games, the humdrum games; you may find it hard to be captivated by the drama of a draw between Crystal Palace and Burnley, but that may well be true in a full stadium, too. When the stakes are high, though, when the games really matter, you do not need to imbue a game with meaning, you simply need to infer it. That is because, deep down, there is a lie that we tell ourselves, one that players and managers and executives are complicit in. It is a harmless lie, a comforting lie, a kind lie, one that we tell ourselves to excuse and to explain our passion, to transform our powerlessness into agency, to make us feel as if our love is reciprocated. It may be a lie that contains a form of truth. It is almost certainly a lie that those who perpetuate it do not know it to be a lie. It is that they play for the fans, for us -- that we are not merely observers of the events that play out on the field, but the purpose and inspiration for them.

And yet if these last few months have shown anything, it is that is not true. Mbappe's smile and Diallo's joy and Atalanta's pain and Sterling's despair have all been real, and it has all been real because, deep down, the players and the coaches we adore are not doing it for us. They are doing it for themselves. They are doing it because this is what they have dedicated their lives to achieving, because this is what they are trained for, because this is what they dreamed of, because this is what they spend every waking hour (in some cases) thinking about. They are doing it for pride and for status and for ambition and, sometimes -- though not as often as people say -- for money. That has been clear not just from the Champions League, but from countless scenes in countless countries. It has been striking to see how many players have celebrated goals in empty stadiums as if the stands were full to bursting. At first, it was tempting to see it as a force of habit -- what else are you going to do? -- but after a while, it became clear that it was not. It was a genuine expression of joy. They wanted to run to the corner. They wanted to raise their arms. Their happiness was not dependent on our presence. The celebrations by Liverpool and Real Madrid and Bayern Munich when they won their leagues were not artificial. Nor were Chelsea's or Manchester United's when they qualified for the Champions League, or Aston Villa's when it avoided relegation. Soccer means something to the players whether fans are there or not. They do not need to be told what to feel. That has always been true, of course. To some extent, it is perhaps not especially revelatory. But only now, in these weeks of quiet and still in the stadiums, has it been brought into sharp focus. That is what has been most striking about soccer's summer behind closed doors, what the new normal has allowed us to see: that the game does mean something, whether we are there to interpret it or not.

If Josep Maria Bartomeu, the Barcelona president, was trying to project an image of dynamism, and decisiveness, and power, then he succeeded. Within 72 hours of his team's humiliating defeat to Bayern Munich last week, Bartomeu had: told his sporting director to fire his coach; fired his sporting director; announced a list of players he considered the integral cornerstones of the club's future; and, by omission, effectively revealed that everyone else was available for sale. If all of that was designed to project an image of control, though, it fell short. Barcelona's new coach, Ronald Koeman, has a wealth of experience, but there is little in his managerial career to suggest he would have been given this chance if he were not a former Barcelona player. His appointment smacked of panic. So, too, did the very public revelation that Barcelona would listen to offers for at least half of its current squad, the likes of Gerard Pique, Luis Suarez and Jordi Alba included. That Barcelona needs an overhaul is no great revelation. That the central problem with carrying it out will be freeing up space in the team -- and on the wage bill -- is blindingly obvious. The problem is there are only a handful of teams that can afford the salaries that the likes of Pique and Suarez and the others command. Only a small portion of that handful would be likely to commit to those salaries when most of these players are approaching the twilight of their careers. So all Bartomeu's announcement did was irritate several players he may not be able to offload, and guarantee that potential buyers feel empowered to take advantage of Barcelona's desperation. It felt like the act of a man who needed to be seen to do something. Quite how, exactly, he plans to do it seems to remain open to question.

To all of you who wrote in to tell me why it is that home teams are listed second in American sports, consider your work done: I've had dozens of emails explaining that it stems from the tradition of the home team batting second in baseball. Roughly half of those emails also pointed out that having a built-in home-field advantage* cannot accurately be described as either charming or gracious. There were several requests for ways to improve other sports, too. Marty Forken asked for assistance on how to deal with ""the inordinate amount of time spent standing around between plays and replay reviews"" in the N.F.L., and Leonardo De Bellis is in the market for ways to change the atmosphere in ""motor sports, in particular Formula 1."" My instinct is to be smart and cheap, but seeing as I'm in the middle of a fascinating book on the rise of the N.F.L. in American life, I'm minded to resist. F1's problem, as far as I can tell, is its predictability; it strikes me that leveling the field a little -- maybe they could weigh Lewis Hamilton's car down or something, like they do with horses -- might make it feel less of a procession. I don't know if you can improve the atmosphere, though. Have you ever been to an auto race? There's loads of cars. It's really loud. You can barely hear yourself think. A tip of the hat, too, to John Matthew. ""I think the best way to improve Rugby League,"" he wrote, ""is to adopt Rugby Union rules."" It's definitely an idea that is worth exploring, but it needs workshopping. Let's start, John, by flipping the whole concept around. A full 180. Then we might really be onto something.",The joy of elite soccer is real. So is the pain.

Theater,Outdoor Stages: A Madcap 'Pride & Prejudice' in the Hudson Valley,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/29/theater/a-madcap-pride-prejudice-alfresco-in-the-hudson-valley.html,"This summer, however, the prickliest pair in fiction can be found most nights in their own D.I.Y. Pemberley, a tent in Garrison, N.Y., overlooking the Hudson River -- and reminding audiences that the finest china in their beloved Jane Austen is as likely to be a chamber pot as a teacup. Lizzy is Kate Hamill. Her stage adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Pride & Prejudice"" had its premiere last Saturday at the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival there, where it will play in repertory until September before shifting to Primary Stages Off Broadway in November. And yes, Ms. Hamill acts opposite her nonfictional boyfriend, Jason O'Connell. It's a first for the couple, although he played the future brother-in-law, Edward, to her Marianne Dashwood in Ms. Hamill's previous Austen adaptation, ""Sense & Sensibility,"" a rollicking muslins-on-wheels affair (by the appropriately named theater company Bedlam) that had an acclaimed run Off Broadway last year. Ms. Hamill, 33, says she plans to adapt all six Austen novels for the stage -- probably in the order of their writing, the better to chart her own progress against Austen's. ""Northanger Abbey"" may be next. (""There's something I love about teenage vernacular,"" she said in an interview last week.) Starting with ""Sense & Sensibility"" was perhaps wise: She could gauge the appetite for yet another Austen adaptation before adapting the most adapted -- and cherished -- of them all, ""Pride & Prejudice."" ""It's the one everyone knows,"" she said. ""People have a serious attachment to it."" ""Sense"" was such a hit that even a committed Janeite's attachment might well withstand an irreverent ""Pride.""

And it is irreverent. Think men cast as Mary, the plain and prudish Bennet sister, and as the snobbish Miss Bingley. A lot of ""intentional water spillage."" Mr. Bingley as near to being a puppy as a man can be without being on all fours. ""People might feel I have desecrated their idols, but, you know, at least I've tried to do something interesting,"" she said, noting that she had not put zombies in it, and that ""I haven't set it on Mars."" She has discovered, however, that ""Janeites"" -- and she counts herself as one -- ""are pretty open-minded people; they're exceptionally generous. Because sometimes I'm taking liberties."" Ms. Hamill doesn't see the purpose in adapting a classic unless there is a clear point of view. She found hers for ""Pride & Prejudice"" in the exaggerated notion of courtship and marriage as a game with winners, losers, referees and exceptionally bad coaches. She applied her own ""historical ambivalence about marriage"" just as she was arriving at the age when her friends were pairing off around her. She concluded that matches happen between people ""whose weirdnesses fit together.""

She looked to the Shakespeare canon for a model. ""It's a romantic comedy, and I was thinking, what romantic comedies do I not hate?"" The answer was ""Much Ado About Nothing."" ""I thought the big challenge going into it was, everyone knows who gets together,"" she said. ""I wanted to make a certain story uncertain. How do you make a 'Much Ado' where you're really not sure if Benedick and Beatrice get together?"" She was not afraid to go broad and go silly. There are games galore in her production. (In researching games of the period, she said, she discovered one in which participants simply slap one another in the face. It's not in her production.)

Bells ring throughout her play: wedding bells; alarm bells; the kind of bells that signal rounds in a prizefight; a chime that sounds, if only in your head, when you connect with your imperfect perfect match. (""It kind of annoys me when both Lizzy and Darcy are supermodels,"" she said.) The clanging insistence of bells became a critical device to her retelling of this classic story about the game of games: the marriage game. Ms. Hamill grew up in a farmhouse in rural Lansing, N.Y., the fifth of six siblings. She knows how to milk a cow and collect eggs from hens, but she spent much of her time reading (""My parents didn't believe in TV""), and she joined the theater program in her very small high school. That's where she gained some sage advice. She was studying to be an actress, but the drama teacher told the girls that if they wanted work, they had to create it.

When she moved to New York, one of her jobs involved writing copy for catalogs. Hundreds of descriptions of jewelry. ""You start to just amuse yourself: What else can I say about this pendant?"" Early on, she said, ""in my mind a serious writer was someone different from me,"" and she remained committed to acting. But she wearied of auditions for ""silent suffering girlfriend"" and ""girl in bikini."" That's when she recalled her old instructor's counsel. Three-quarters of all plays are written by men, and an overwhelming majority of parts are for men, she said, reeling off statistics she seemed to have learned the hard way. She began to think about creating ""new classics."" In addition to the two Austen novels, she has adapted Thackeray's ""Vanity Fair,"" and is at work on Louisa May Alcott's ""Little Women"" and -- why not? -- ""The Odyssey,"" for which she wrote a scene, she said, featuring a Cyclops singing to his sheep. In the meantime, she is vastly amused to be doing a show with Mr. O'Connell in which they get to ""bicker and hate each other for hours"" -- and nightly he must recite a proposal that was written by her.","Fresh off the success of her adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Sense & Sensibility,"" Kate Hamill takes on ""Pride & Prejudice.""",a5c647eb-8c39-5e5a-a42e-80bd97744cbc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/30/arts/30OUTDOORPERFORMANCE/30OUTDOORPERFORMANCE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=5eba4078ee050418749b9ba34fc9fa7b4db32bf64282a8a40770e85ca1707ee9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"John Tufts, center, as Mr. Bingley in Kate Hamill's adaptation of ""Pride & Prejudice"" at the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival in Garrison, N.Y.

Media,AMC Promotes Sarah Barnett After Losing an Executive to Fox,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/05/business/media/amc-networks-sarah-barnett.html,"Sarah Barnett, the head of BBC America, will take on an expanded role at AMC Networks that puts her in charge of several cable channels, including AMC, SundanceTV and IFC, the company said on Monday.

The move was announced a week and a half after Charlie Collier, a former leader of the company, left to take a new position as the chief executive of Fox's entertainment offerings.

Ms. Barnett, 53, helped usher in buzzy shows like ""Orphan Black"" and ""Killing Eve"" at BBC America, which is part of AMC Networks.

She will be stepping into an expanded role at a crucial time for the company's flagship network, which exploded in popularity a decade ago, thanks to ""Mad Men"" and ""Breaking Bad,"" and is home to ""The Walking Dead.""

Art & Design,Imminent Union Vote Sparks Debate at Manhattan's New Museum,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/arts/design/union-vote-sparks-debate-at-new-museum.html,"The New Museum of Contemporary Art has long identified the need for diversity and free expression as core values, often programming events that reflect that mission. So some museum employees, as well as artists whose work has appeared there, said they were surprised when, upon learning that staff members were working to form a union, the museum hired a consulting firm that markets itself as a ""team of experienced union avoidance consultants."" The firm, Adams Nash Haskell & Sheridan, based in Kentucky, says on its website, ""We can help you quickly convince your employees to vote against the union, because it is a bad thing for them."" The employees announced their intentions on Jan. 10 and are to vote Thursday on a proposal to join Local 2110 of the United Auto Workers. Organizers said they expected the totals to be tabulated that day. Those voting include art handlers, associate curators, staff members of the book and gift shop and others.

A member of the firm met earlier this month with some museum staff members who could be eligible to join the union. ""He pushed the idea that a union is an outside force,"" Dana Kopel, a senior editor and publications coordinator at the museum, said. ""That union representation would make our work harder or more complicated.""

Martha Rosler, a photographer and video artist, was among about 50 people who signed an open letter saying they were troubled by the decision to ""hire an anti-union firm to sow fear and hostility and to misinform both management and staff about the role of unions in the workplace."" Her 30-year retrospective appeared at the New Museum and the International Center for Photography in 2000. ""When workers tell you they need a union, then they need a union,"" Ms. Rosler said by telephone. ""There is no question that the labor movement is what brought us to whatever good spaces we've been brought to socially.""

The museum's director, Lisa Phillips, declined a request to be interviewed. In a statement on Wednesday the museum said, ""We fully respect our employees' right to self-organize, and we will respect whatever decision they make."" ""We don't believe unionization is the best way to preserve what is special about our culture or advance change,"" the statement said, describing the New Museum as a relatively small institution where staff members are used to working closely and collaboratively. The statement said the museum had hired Adams Nash for ""an initial consult"" to provide information on the unionization process, adding that some employees had expressed interest in joining a bargaining unit, while others were not interested or unsure. The statement said that now that the information has been provided, the museum no longer employs the firm. The United Auto Workers already represents employees at the Museum of Modern Art, the Bronx Museum of the Arts and the New-York Historical Society. Employees who support a union at the New Museum said it is needed to ensure that they receive competitive salaries and have clear roles going forward as the institution carries out a planned $85-million expansion. Organizers said they have identified 74 museum employees who will form a bargaining unit. The museum has contested some of those selections. Ms. Kopel said some museum employees earn as little as $35,000 a year to start. She said the museum told employees that the median income for the staff members contemplating joining a union was $52,000, and that $51,000 is considered a living wage. The New Museum spokesman confirmed in an email that $52,000 is the median income for the workers the museum says are eligible to be in a union.

The New Museum was founded in 1977 by a curator, Marcia Tucker, as a place to present, study and interpret contemporary works. Known for an open-minded approach to art and public dialogue, the museum says on its website: ""We embrace difference, debate, and multiple viewpoints regardless of race, gender, class, or creed."" Museum employees cited the institution's reputation and history in their initial announcement that they wanted to form a union. Ms. Tucker had ""envisioned an institution that did away with hierarchies -- not only in the art exhibited, but in the structure of the Museum itself,"" the announcement said. It went on to ask that the museum's dedication to diversity and progress ""be mirrored in the Museum's working conditions, hiring practices, wages and benefits."" An exhibition coming next month typifies the museum's approach. It will present a survey by the artist Nari Ward, whose work reflects on the effects of gentrification and on what the museum terms ""the increasingly fractured state of democracy in the United States."" Ms. Kopel said that during a staff meeting on Wednesday morning several museum leaders, including Ms. Phillips, cautioned workers against voting in favor of the union. Ms. Phillips told employees that forming a union ""could cause irreparable damage,"" Ms. Kopel said.","The museum, known for exhibitions that embrace diversity and free expression, has drawn criticism for efforts to dissuade its staff from unionizing.",e4ae8e94-2cca-5dc8-81d0-b38c135a5e17,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/25/arts/25busting1/25busting1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=d6a594e66322fa8249194fbe38b99cc2587737f9d4fdf0753ea1b333192c9197&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Some staff members of the New Museum, located on Bowery Street in Manhattan, are set to vote Thursday on whether to join a union.",e4ae8e94-2cca-5dc8-81d0-b38c135a5e17,N24News/imgs/e4ae8e94-2cca-5dc8-81d0-b38c135a5e17.jpg,14

This Weekend I Have ... 9 Minutes, and Who Is That Again?

'Under a Rock With Tig Notaro'

When to watch: Now, on YouTube.

The comedian and writer Tig Notaro doesn't much keep up with pop culture, and thus she does not seem to know who any of the guests are on her new short-form talk show.

Sports,N.Y.C.F.C. Is Close to Deal to Build Stadium in the Bronx,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/sports/soccer/nycfc-stadium-bronx-mls.html,"New York City F.C.'s circuitous search for a permanent home -- a seven-year quest that generated frustration for the team, exasperation among its supporters and endless ridicule from rival fans in Major League Soccer -- has come full circle. The team's owners, in conjunction with a group of local developers, are nearing an agreement with New York City that would allow the team to construct a privately financed, 25,000-seat stadium in the South Bronx as part of a development project costing more than $1 billion. The new stadium, the anchor of a plan that will replace parking lots and an elevator parts factory with affordable housing units, a new school, a hotel and retail stores, would rise just a short walk's distance down River Avenue from the team's current home at Yankee Stadium. The group of developers, which includes Jorge Madruga's Maddd Equities, says the project has the support of Mayor Bill de Blasio and James Patchett, the president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. The E.D.C. said in a statement that it sees value in the proposal but cautioned that no formal agreement has been finalized.

""It's long past time to make the underutilized parking lots around Yankee Stadium into something more,"" a representative for the E.D.C. said in a statement Friday. ""The city has been approached by a team of affordable housing developers, the Yankees and the N.Y.C. Football Club. ""A deal has not been reached, and more conversations are needed. We are hopeful for a future where these lots can better serve the community. The first step toward achieving that is engaging the community on their needs and vision for this area."" A New York City F.C. representative confirmed the discussions but, perhaps wary because of earlier failures, expressed similar caution. ""We have been honored to call the Bronx our home for the last five years playing at Yankee Stadium, and we will keep our neighbors and our dedicated fans informed as we participate with Maddd and others in any related consultations and the public approval process,"" the team said. Final approval for the project, including public hearings and an application for rezoning the site and decommissioning the affected roadways, will require several months. But the developers said they were confident they would not face the kind of community and governmental opposition that scuttled previous proposals.

If approved, the stadium will be built on the current sites of one of the old parking garages currently used for Yankee games and the GAL elevator parts factory across East 153rd Street. In order to connect the two plots on which the stadium will sit, that block of East 153rd, from River Avenue to the Major Deegan Expressway, will become part of the playing field. An off ramp from the Deegan will be closed as well; it is set to become a pedestrian walkway to a new waterfront park.

* Phillie Phavorite: Bryce Harper truly committed to Philadelphia and now he's back on top of baseball, winning the N.L. M.V.P.
* Cy Young Winners: Milwaukee's Corbin Burnes and Toronto's Robbie Ray had hit rock bottom before they worked their way up to stardom.

* Free-Agency Tracker: Get the latest updates on signings, contract extensions and trades. Construction would not begin until at least 2022 and could take several years, meaning it is unlikely the team would move in until at least 2024.

The complicated plan was made possible when the Yankees' president, Randy Levine, approached Maddd Equities, a developer that produces affordable housing in the city, and said the team would be willing to scale back its requirement for thousands of parking spaces in the immediate area of Yankee Stadium, allowing Maddd to purchase them. The Yankees own 20 percent of N.Y.C.F.C., part of a joint venture with an investment group led by Sheik Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a member of the royal family of Abu Dhabi, who also controls the English soccer champion Manchester City. By purchasing the six scattered parking lots (five outdoors and one indoor structure) for $54 million, Maddd Equities will help the Bronx Parking Development Corporation, a nonprofit set up when the new Yankee Stadium was built, get out from under crippling debt, a problem that has vexed the city for years. Some of the lots will be used for the housing and some for the stadium and hotel. Maddd and N.Y.C.F.C. also are in contract to purchase the GAL factory. They would then convey the property to the city, which would then lease the land back for the stadium.

""It's a moment in time where the stars have aligned,"" said Eli Weiss of Joy Construction, one of the developers involved in the proposal. ""And by the stars, I mean all the people involved."" The project will be a tight fit, with everything tucked into a parcel of land a few blocks south of Yankee Stadium, hard by the Metro North train tracks and a short walk to the Harlem River. And construction cannot begin until all the procedural steps and approval requirements have been met. A similar proposal for the site in 2018 collapsed, but this time the team and the developers are working closely with city and state officials, and expressed confidence that they would gain full approval. That confidence is largely based on the affordable housing component and the fact that the factory will be moved to another site in the Bronx and continue to employ its workers. When New York City F.C. was founded in 2013, it arrived in M.L.S. with deep pockets and a public pledge to build a stadium within the city's five boroughs. That proved to be a daunting task. Every time a site was identified -- in the Bronx, on the edges of Manhattan, in Queens or just beyond its borders -- it was just as quickly ruled out, running up against one obstacle or another. As the search dragged on, the team and its frustrated fans persevered in temporary conditions at Yankee Stadium that were far from perfect. Each time a scheduling conflict with the Yankees arose, it was the soccer team that hit the road: The team has played regular-season, cup and even playoff games on college fields at St. John's and Fordham; hours away at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Conn.; and even at Citi Field in Queens.

When the new Yankee Stadium was built, the Yankees demanded about 9,300 spaces to accommodate their fans on game days, but the team has agreed to reduce the number of spaces by about 3,000 to accommodate the new project. That reduction was made possible because more people are using public transportation and ride-share options that did not exist when the stadium opened in 2009. ""That's what made this deal happen,"" Madruga said of the Yankees' relaxing their parking covenant. ""Without the Yankees, the reality is that this deal does not happen.""",A seven-year search for a home for the Major League Soccer team appears set to end right down the street from Yankee Stadium.,9af8014c-e40d-5640-b8f4-2f2add808c6d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/07/sports/07nycfc/07nycfc-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=6291d3699b70f8b6b9a8c327d5c163c40bbb8fe76ef280e8197430f836ee182e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,New York City F.C. has used Yankee Stadium as a temporary home since 2015.,9af8014c-e40d-5640-b8f4-2f2add808c6d,N24News/imgs/9af8014c-e40d-5640-b8f4-2f2add808c6d.jpg,9

Food,"After 20 Years Under One Chef, Peasant Is Changing Hands",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/dining/peasant-restaurant-marc-forgione.html,"After 20 Years Under One Chef, Peasant Is Changing Hands

At the end of the month, the chef Frank DeCarlo will exchange his kitchen clogs for oxblood Dr. Martens street boots, wipe down his station and walk out of Peasant, the NoLIta restaurant he has owned for 20 years, for the last time. That's the bad news: Peasant is a beloved restaurant, well ahead of its time in its casual simplicity and cooking over an open fire. With a warm interior and straightforward Italian menu, it has become a favorite of famous chefs and neighbors alike. But here's the good news: The chef and restaurateur Marc Forgione, whose namesake restaurant has served contemporary food since 2008, is buying Peasant. Although the menu will slowly change, Peasant will keep its name and its basic, straight-from-the-hearth style.

Mr. DeCarlo, 60, plans to travel, spend time at his second home on Shelter Island and keep running his restaurant Barba Bianca in Greenport, N.Y., which opened in 2017, and Bacaro, on the Lower East Side, which opened in 2007. ""For 20 years, we've had a really good run,"" he said. ""But it's time for me to do something new."" Until then, Mr. DeCarlo, who has worked the line almost every night at Peasant for two decades, has to help his staff prepare for his absence. He has to take down a web of motorcycle and classic-rock photographs that decorate the office he shares with his wife, Dulcinea Benson, 49, the general manager and sommelier. He wants to help his successor learn the ropes.

As Mr. Forgione eases into his new role, both chefs want to keep the soul of Peasant intact. Most of the staff have been there for years, some since the beginning, a rarity in the churn of New York restaurants. The sous-chef, Olivier Pillard, even helped Mr. DeCarlo pour the cement for the concrete floor. He will be there, stewarding the kitchen, after Mr. DeCarlo leaves. Every day, suckling pig is roasted for hours, then served pulled, with a rib, over milk-braised fingerling potatoes. Many chefs consider the dish to be the heart of the menu. ""No way can I take them off the menu,"" Mr. Forgione said. ""Sure,"" Mr. DeCarlo added. ""You'll just do it differently, that's all.""

When Mr. DeCarlo signed the lease for Peasant in 1999, the same week he married Ms. Benson, New York was in an age of complicated, fancy cooking. He wanted none of that. ""I wanted to do something original,"" he said. ""I didn't want to just follow the trend."" Instead, he envisioned a neighborhood restaurant, a place that felt like home. He designed and built the kitchen himself. And then, he started to cook. ""I don't understand the chefs that don't work in their own kitchens,"" Mr. DeCarlo said. ""If you go to see the Rolling Stones, you don't want to see Keith Richards's guitar tech onstage.""

Both serve meals that feel like special occasions. Both chefs are united in their reverence for by-touch, by-sight cooking. Both have long-term relationships with their staff and partners: Mr. Forgione will bring along Matthew Conway, the general manager and sommelier at Marc Forgione. ""It's very important to me that the energy, the passion of this place keeps going,"" Mr. Forgione said. Last Friday afternoon, just as the pigs had started their slow turn over a bright wood fire, Mr. DeCarlo walked through the empty restaurant to the bar. A few minutes later, he came back with espressos he'd made for his chefs.

In the door frame between the front and back of the house, he sipped his coffee, looking out at the dining room. Two decades of memories were made in those rooms: anniversaries and birthdays, first dates and graduations. He says he'll be back. Next time , though, he'll get to put his feet up and enjoy what he built from the other side of the plate.","As Frank DeCarlo prepares to leave his NoLIta fixture, Marc Forgione is taking over and vowing to preserve its rustic charm.",1e6cfe87-21c6-57db-846a-ff2b1e5992f1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/11/dining/04Peasant4/04Peasant4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=e82e962a8cb57f065dd2b568e2a3701d55cb68c9f3e213da882976623d962713&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Frank DeCarlo, the chef and owner of Peasant, has worked the line for 20 years.

Fashion & Style,What a Hand Model Knows About Skin Care,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/17/fashion/hand-model-secrets.html,"Adele Uddo is a model whose job is to stay mostly out of the picture. On a cover shoot for Town & Country, for example, Hugh Jackman perched on apple crates while Ms. Uddo stood beneath him, arm raised, so the only part of her in the frame was her hand cupping his face, her slender fingers tousling his hair. David Yurman bracelets were taped to her forearm so they'd hang artfully (and not catch Mr. Jackman's beard). ""I actually used to be embarrassed about admitting I was a hand model, like I should be contributing more to society than nice nail beds,"" said Ms. Uddo, who, like many women in front of the camera, declined to reveal her age. ""But I figure we're all doing our part."" Ms. Uddo is one of the most successful parts models in the world, able to command as much as $6,000 for a day's work, she said. She's usually hired for her hands, which have grasped a Chanel No. 5 perfume bottle, held a Christian Louboutin shoe, revealed a Dior Rouge lipstick -- and have been stand-ins for those of Penelope Cruz and Katy Perry. But Ms. Uddo is also the rare parts model with more than one in-demand feature. Her abs, chest, feet and lips have also appeared in Vogue magazine pages and on billboards. ""Adele's isn't the Everywoman hand,"" said Jennifer Adjali, the global director of education for Essie nail polish, whose campaigns often feature Ms. Uddo. ""It's that high-end luxury hand. She can sell diamonds.""

Ms. Uddo is sometimes rejected for jobs that call for more of a ""mom hand"" -- say, to wipe up tomato sauce. ""If I have shorter nails and more of a nude, natural polish, I usually can pass,"" she said. Ms. Uddo dropped out of college to become a model of the more traditional variety when a telephone psychic suggested it. (If that sounds like unorthodox career coaching ... well, Ms. Uddo grew up on a California commune and also employs a psychic for her dog and cat.) But at 5-foot-6, she was too short for most jobs. Then one day her agent asked if she had nice hands and sent her on a call for OPI nail polish. She got the job. The work can be tedious. She can't text or read because often two manicurists work on her simultaneously. The process is repeated for up to 15 nail looks in a day. ""Luckily I'm a double Libra, so I can space out pretty easily,"" said Ms. Uddo, who divides her time between the Chelsea neighborhood in Manhattan and Malibu, Calif., where her husband of eight years lives. Some hand models baby their hands, wearing armorlike gloves and keeping their arms raised to avoid bloating. (For George Costanza on ""Seinfeld,"" oven mitts did the trick.) But Ms. Uddo considers herself a ""rebel hand model,"" even hiking, a favorite pastime. She does admit to moving slowly and deliberately so as not to break a nail, avoiding cooking and limiting caffeine so her hands don't shake on tight close-ups. She moisturizes with an all-natural lotion she makes herself and met a reporter for tea wearing fingerless gloves, which she kept on indoors.

Ms. Uddo said she wonders how long she can keep up a bicoastal existence (most jobs for ""fashion hands"" are in New York) and is working at bringing her lotion to market. She's practicing her pitch (""It's an all-in-one lotion!""), which includes putting an empowering spin on her work. ""We women can be hard on ourselves, but every woman should be able to find some part of her that she most likes,"" Ms. Uddo said. ""That's kind of all you need in this business.""

Adele Uddo never fully dries her hands because it's better to moisturize -- something she does about 10 times a day -- when the skin is still damp. She uses a concoction of coconut and vitamin E oils with shea and jojoba butters that she whips up in her kitchen. When she's not using her homemade product, she likes Weleda (her mother had her use it as a child) and a lotion called Luxe by Ladybug Jane (a vegan line).","Adele Uddo is one of the most successful models you've never heard of, even though her job is to stay mostly out of the picture.",f192f6e0-f2c4-526d-b50f-f206c364e0c4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/17/fashion/17SKIN1/17SKIN1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=a28150cb9d16dbef2651f1636a16a8b3783557876ab495fb011b33731319fcb2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Adele Uddo is one of the most successful parts models in the world, able to command as much as $6,000 for a day's work.",f192f6e0-f2c4-526d-b50f-f206c364e0c4,N24News/imgs/f192f6e0-f2c4-526d-b50f-f206c364e0c4.jpg,19
Technology,'Businesses Will Not Be Able to Hide': Spy Satellites May Give Edge From Above,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/technology/satellites-artificial-intelligence.html,"'Businesses Will Not Be Able to Hide': Spy Satellites May Give Edge From Above

SAN FRANCISCO -- In October, the Chinese province of Guangdong -- the manufacturing center on the southern coast that drives 12 percent of the country's economy -- stopped publishing a monthly report on the health of its local factories. For five consecutive months, this key economic index had shown a drop in factory production as the United States applied billions of dollars in tariffs on Chinese exports. Then, amid an increasingly bitter trade war between the United States and China, the government authorities in Beijing shut the index down. A small start-up in San Francisco began rebuilding the index, lifting information from photos and infrared images of Guangdong's factories captured by satellites orbiting overhead. The company, SpaceKnow, is now selling this information to hedge funds, banks and other market traders looking for an edge. High-altitude surveillance was once the domain of global superpowers. Now, a growing number of start-ups are turning it into a business, aiming to sell insights gleaned from cameras and other sensors installed on small and inexpensive ""cube satellites.""

The companies and governments that spent decades using internet services, cameras and other devices to collect data on regular people may soon get a taste of their own information technology. ""Businesses will not be able to hide from competitors or regulators or watchdogs,"" said Mark Johnson, chief executive and co-founder of Descartes Labs, another satellite information start-up. ""They need to realize that their traditional competitive advantage -- information -- will be available to everyone."" Nearly 730 Earth observation satellites were launched over the last decade, according to Euroconsult, a research firm that tracks the space market. In the next 10 years, 2,220 more will follow them into orbit, training an increasingly wide array of sensors on the planet. Orbital Insight, in Palo Alto, Calif., is one of the first companies to build a business around cube satellite data. Sitting in Orbital's offices on a recent afternoon, James Crawford, the company's founder and chief executive, who goes by Jimi, opened his laptop and pulled up a report on three big-name retailers: J. C. Penney, Macy's and Sears.

You don't need satellite photos to know that Sears is failing. Companies like Orbital Insight are typically tight-lipped when it comes to more important data -- as are their customers -- mainly because they see this information as a competitive advantage. But the line graph showed how Mr. Crawford and his start-up can target the performance of individual businesses. Orbital Insight tracks activity in more than 260,000 retail parking lots across the country, and it monitors the levels of more than 25,000 oil tanks around the world. Not surprisingly, Orbital Insight and SpaceKnow said, some of their customers use this satellite data to track the progress of their direct competitors, though those customers and their competitors are very reluctant to talk about it. Mr. Crawford believes the satellite analysis will ultimately lead to more efficient markets and a better understanding of the global economy. Fred Abrahams, a researcher with the advocacy group Human Rights Watch, sees it as a check on the world's companies and governments. Mr. Abrahams and his team use satellite imagery to track everything from illegal mining and logging operations to large-scale home demolitions. ""This is why we are so committed to these technologies,"" he said. ""They make it that much harder to hide large-scale abuses."" All of this is being driven by a drop in the cost of building, launching and operating satellites. Today, a $3 million satellite that weighs less than 10 pounds can capture significantly sharper images than a $300 million, 900-pound satellite built in the late 1990s. That allows companies to put up dozens of devices, each of which can focus on a particular area of the globe or on a particular kind of data collection. As a result, more companies are sending more satellites into orbit, and these satellites are generating more data.

And recent advances in artificial intelligence allow machines to analyze this data with greater speed and accuracy. ""The future is automation, with humans only looking at the very interesting stuff,"" Mr. Crawford said. Orbital Insight does not operate its own satellites. Nor does SpaceKnow or Descartes Labs. The start-ups buy their data from a growing number of satellite operators, and they build the automated systems that analyze the data, pinpointing objects like cars, buildings, mines and oil tankers in high-resolution photos and other images. Now, satellite operators are building similar systems, selling analysis as well as the raw data. The market topped $4.6 billion in 2017. By 2027, it will reach $11.4 billion, according to Euroconsult. What began with satellite cameras is rapidly expanding to infrared sensors that detect heat; ""hyperspectral"" sensors that identify minerals, vegetation and other materials; and radar scanners that can build three-dimensional images of the landscape below. As it reconstructs the Guangdong economic index, SpaceKnow uses infrared imagery, which can help show activity around roughly 600 factories and other industrial sites in the province. After a new satellite went up in December, a Virginia start-up called HawkEye 360 will soon track wireless signals -- a way of understanding the behavior of everything from cellphone networks to cargo ships. This could provide new insight in the progress of cellular companies like AT&T and Verizon, including how many cellular towers are in operation, how active they are, and what technologies and wireless bands are being used. But as technology improves and costs drop, some still warn satellite intelligence gathering has its limits. Finding useful information in satellite imagery can be expensive, said Shawana Johnson, a veteran of satellite intelligence work who is now the president of Global Marketing Insights, a consulting firm dedicated to this area. ""You have to want to look at a variety of activities across the Earth and look at them daily -- or weekly -- for the cost to makes sense,"" she said.","With 2,200 observation satellites going into orbit in the next decade, start-ups are trying to use them to churn out financially useful information that could help companies track their rivals.",2ec17dcf-b6fd-53ec-a9dc-dc44b29fb053,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/25/business/25SATELLITEAI01/25SATELLITEAI01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=434d88f4cbcd1efaf6e64e4d29ce919e0ece1ed02dfc7b2cd478d55079ce0f19&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"An image of San Francisco taken by a satellite launched into orbit last year by the Finnish company Iceye, one of the companies turning high-altitude surveillance into a business.",2ec17dcf-b6fd-53ec-a9dc-dc44b29fb053,N24News/imgs/2ec17dcf-b6fd-53ec-a9dc-dc44b29fb053.jpg,20
Health,"W.H.O., Now Trump's Scapegoat, Warned About Coronavirus Early and Often",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/health/WHO-Trump-coronavirus.html,"On Jan. 22, two days after Chinese officials first publicized the serious threat posed by the new virus ravaging the city of Wuhan, the chief of the World Health Organization held the first of what would be months of almost daily media briefings, sounding the alarm, telling the world to take the outbreak seriously. But with its officials divided, the W.H.O., still seeing no evidence of sustained spread of the virus outside of China, declined the next day to declare a global public health emergency. A week later, the organization reversed course and made the declaration. Those early days of the epidemic illustrated the strengths and weaknesses of the W.H.O., an arm of the United Nations that is now under fire by President Trump, who on Tuesday ordered a cutoff of American funding to the organization. With limited, constantly shifting information to go on, the W.H.O. showed an early, consistent determination to treat the new contagion like the threat it would become, and to persuade others to do the same. At the same time, the organization repeatedly praised China, acting and speaking with a political caution born of being an arm of the United Nations, with few resources of its own, unable to do its work without international cooperation.

But a close look at the record shows that the W.H.O. acted with greater foresight and speed than many national governments, and more than it had shown in previous epidemics. And while it made mistakes, there is little evidence that the W.H.O. is responsible for the disasters that have unfolded in Europe and then the United States. The W.H.O. needs the support of its international members to accomplish anything -- it has no authority over any territory, it cannot go anywhere uninvited, and it relies on member countries for its funding. All it can offer is expertise and coordination -- and even most of that is borrowed from charities and member nations. The W.H.O. has drawn criticism as being too close to Beijing -- a charge that grew louder as the agency repeatedly praised China for cooperation and transparency that others said were lacking. China's harsh approach to containing the virus drew some early criticism from human rights activists, but it proved effective and has since been adopted by many other countries.

A crucial turning point in the pandemic came on Jan. 20, after China's central government sent the country's most famous epidemiologist, Zhong Nanshan, to Wuhan to investigate the new coronavirus racing through that city of 11 million people. Dr. Zhong delivered a startling message on national television: Local officials had covered up the seriousness of the outbreak, the contagion spread quickly between people, doctors were dying and everyone should avoid the city. Dr. Zhong, an eccentric 83-year-old who led the fight against the SARS outbreak of 2002 and 2003, was one of few people in China with enough standing to effectively call Wuhan's mayor, Zhou Xianwang, a rising official in the Communist Party, a liar. Mr. Zhou, eager to see no disruption in his plans for a local party congress from Jan. 11 to 17 and a potluck dinner for 40,000 families on Jan. 18, appears to have had his police and local health officials close the seafood market, threaten doctors and assure the public that there was little or no transmission. Less than three days after Dr. Zhong's warning was broadcast, China locked down the city, preventing anyone from entering or leaving and imposing strict rules on movement within it -- conditions it would later extend far behind Wuhan, encompassing tens of millions of people.

Despite Dr. Zhong's warning about human-to-human transmission, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.'s director-general, said there was not yet any evidence of sustained transmission outside China. ""That doesn't mean it won't happen,"" Dr. Tedros said. ""Make no mistake,"" he added. ""This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one."" The W.H.O. was still trying to persuade China to allow a team of its experts to visit and investigate, which did not occur until more than three weeks later. And the threat to the rest of the world on Jan. 23 was not yet clear -- only about 800 cases and 25 deaths had been reported, with only a handful of infections and no deaths reported outside China. ""In retrospect, we all wonder if something else could have been done to prevent the spread we saw internationally early on, and if W.H.O. could have been more aggressive sooner as an impartial judge of the China effort,"" said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, co-director of the MetaCenter for Pandemic Preparedness and Global Health Security at the University of Washington. Amir Attaran, a public health and law professor at the University of Ottawa, said, ""Clearly a decision was taken by Dr. Tedros and the organization to bite their tongues, and to coax China out of its shell, which was partially successful."" ""That in no way supports Trump's accusation,"" he added. ""The president is scapegoating, dishonestly."" Indeed, significant shortcomings in the administration's response arose from a failure to follow W.H.O. advice.

It is impossible to know whether the nations of the world would have acted sooner if the W.H.O. had called the epidemic a global emergency, a declaration with great public relations weight, a week earlier than it did. But day after day, Dr. Tedros, in his rambling style, was delivering less formal warnings, telling countries to contain the virus while it was still possible, to do testing and contact tracing, and isolate those who might be infected. ""We have a window of opportunity to stop this virus,"" he often said, ""but that window is rapidly closing."" In fact, the organization had already taken steps to address the coronavirus, even before Dr. Zhong's awful revelation, drawing attention to the mysterious outbreak. On Jan. 12, Chinese scientists published the genome of the virus, and the W.H.O. asked a team in Berlin to use that information to develop a diagnostic test. Just four days later, they produced a test and the W.H.O. posted online a blueprint that any laboratory around the world could use to duplicate it. On Jan. 21, China shared materials for its test with the W.H.O., providing another template for others to use.

Larry Gostin, director of the W.H.O.'s Center on Global Health Law, said the organization relied too heavily on the initial assertions out of Wuhan that there was little or no human transmission of the virus. ""The charitable way to look at this is that W.H.O. simply had no means to verify what was happening on the ground,"" he said. ""The less charitable way to view it is that the W.H.O. didn't do enough to independently verify what China was saying, and took China at face value."" The W.H.O. was initially wary of China's internal travel restrictions, but endorsed the strategy after it showed signs of working. ""Right now, the strategic and tactical approach in China is the correct one,"" Dr. Michael Ryan, the W.H.O.'s chief of emergency response, said on Feb. 18. ""You can argue whether these measures are excessive or restrictive on people, but there is an awful lot at stake here in terms of public health -- not only the public health of China but of all people in the world.""

A W.H.O. team -- including two Americans, from the C.D.C. and the National Institutes of Health -- did visit China in mid-February for more than a week, and its leaders said they were given wide latitude to travel, visit facilities and talk with people. Whether or not China's central government intentionally misstated the scale of the crisis, incomplete reporting has been seen in every other hard-hit country. France, Italy and Britain have all acknowledged seriously undercounting cases and deaths among people who were never hospitalized, particularly people in nursing and retirement homes. New York City this week reported 3,700 deaths it had not previously counted, in people who were never tested. The United States generally leaves it to local coroners whether to test bodies for the virus, and many lack the capacity to do so. In the early going, China was operating in a fog, unsure of what it was dealing with, while its resources in and around Wuhan were overwhelmed. People died or recovered at home without ever being treated or tested. Official figures excluded, then included, then excluded again people who had symptoms but had never been tested. On Jan. 31 -- a day after the W.H.O.'s emergency declaration -- President Trump moved to restrict travel from China, and he has since boasted that he took action before other heads of state, which was crucial in protecting the United States. In fact, airlines had already canceled the great majority of flights from China, and other countries cut off travel from China at around the same time Mr. Trump did. The first known case in the United States was confirmed on Jan. 20, after a man who was infected but not yet sick traveled five days earlier from Wuhan to the Seattle area, where the first serious American outbreak would occur.

In fact, the W.H.O. had not said to limit testing, though it had said some testing was a higher priority. It was -- and still is -- calling for more testing in the context of tracing and checking people who had been in contact with infected patients, but few Western countries have done extensive contact tracing. But the organization took pains not to criticize individual countries -- including those that did insufficient testing. On March 16, Dr. Tedros wrote on Twitter, ""We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test."" Three days later, a W.H.O. spokeswoman said that there was ""no 'one size fits all' with testing,"" and that ""each country should consider its strategy based on the evolution of the outbreak."" The organization was criticized for not initially calling the contagion a pandemic, meaning an epidemic spanning the globe. The term has no official significance within the W.H.O., and officials insisted that using it would not change anything, but Dr. Tedros began to do so on March 11, explaining that he made the change to draw attention because too many countries were not taking the group's warnings seriously enough. Reporting was contributed by Selam Gebrekidan, Javier Hernandez, Jason Horowitz, Adam Nossiter, Knvul Sheikh and Roni Caryn Rabin.","The World Health Organization, always cautious, acted more forcefully and faster than many national governments.

Sports,N.F.L. Punishes Titans for Their Handling of Coronavirus Outbreak,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/25/sports/football/covid-outbreak-titans-workout.html,"The N.F.L. has fined the Tennessee Titans $350,000 for their handling of the largest outbreak of coronavirus infections this season, which forced the league to reschedule an array of games. The league, though, did not suspend anyone associated with the Titans, including their coach and general manager, and players who were seen on video participating in an ad hoc practice away from the team's complex. The fine was imposed for failing to communicate workout protocols and not wearing masks in facilities. Roger Goodell, the league commissioner, said two weeks ago that the team, which at 5-1 is among the league's most exciting on the field, was cooperating with the investigation. He had signaled then that no Titans would be held accountable for the outbreak. ""This is not about discipline -- this is about keeping our personnel safe,"" Goodell said on Oct. 13. The league also stopped far short of issuing stiff penalties like the loss of draft picks and the forfeiting of games.

Still, the fine, the largest for a violation of the protocols, came as the league tried to keep its season on track amid infections that had spread to at least four teams. The decision to penalize the Titans came three weeks after the league announced stronger measures designed to lower the risk of infections, including using video surveillance cameras in team facilities to monitor the compliance of protocols such as wearing masks. The league also said that teams not in compliance could be fined, lose draft picks and forfeit games if their actions affected other teams. The outbreak on the Titans had already led to the postponement, by three weeks, of their game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, which was originally planned for Oct. 4. They finally played on Sunday, with the Steelers winning, 27-24. With the number of cases on the team continuing to grow, and the team unable to meet in person to practice for nearly two weeks, the league had postponed the Titans' matchup against the Buffalo Bills, moving it from a Sunday to a Tuesday. The postponement and penalties are not the only scheduling problems the league has been forced to tackle. The league postponed by a day, to Monday, the Week 4 New England-Kansas City game after it was revealed that Cam Newton, the Patriots' star quarterback, and a Chiefs practice squad quarterback had tested positive for the virus on Oct. 3. On that Wednesday, Stephon Gilmore, another Patriots star, tested positive as well, calling into question the league's decision to allow the teams to play. The league has not yet taken the step of adding an 18th week to the season to accommodate postponed games. Nor is there any serious consideration yet of shortening the season. Instead, the league will continue to rely on juggling the existing schedule, including rescheduling games by a day or two, to a Monday or a Tuesday, for example. The league has also fined coaches hundreds of thousands of dollars for failing to wear their face masks properly during games. The Raiders were also fined $50,000 this month for allowing an unauthorized person in their locker room, potentially exposing members of the team. Ten Raiders were fined as much as $30,000 this month for attending a crowded, indoor charity event and not wearing masks while there, violating local health guidelines.

Normally, the competition committee, which includes current coaches, would debate whether teams ought to be penalized for their actions. But because those coaches might have an incentive to come down hard on a rival team, the league created a committee of former coaches, general managers and retired players, including former Giants Coach Tom Coughlin and former Colts General Manager Bill Polian, to make recommendations to the commissioner. The commissioner, though, has ultimate authority over penalties. In the league's century-long history, games have been canceled, postponed or moved because of severe weather or other incidents, including when the roof of the Metrodome collapsed. Only one game appears to have been forfeited, though the records are incomplete. In 1921 -- the league's second year -- the visiting Rochester Jeffersons refused to take the field against the Washington Senators because of the poor condition of the field. In those days, if there was a dispute over whether the field was unplayable, the manager of the home team would decide whether to cancel the game. The Jeffersons' manager did not want to risk injuring his players and wanted the game canceled. But with fans in their seats, the Senators' manager wanted to play, so the referee ruled that the Jeffersons had forfeited the game, according to a newspaper article at the time. The forfeited game does not appear in any record books, however. Final standings were not published at the time and only reconstructed years later, and often imperfectly. Only teams that played a minimum of six games against other league members were included in those reconstructed standings, and the Washington club failed to meet that threshold that year, according to Bob Carroll, who wrote about the game for the journal, The Coffin Corner.","A heavy fine, but no suspensions, came after two dozen players and staff members tested positive for the virus.",3c28e94b-c0d5-5f6b-97ff-88cc10ce2a74,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/25/sports/25titans-fined/25titans-fined-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=76c97afb0ce357b2f98b8f7d37f667266336173110d2e5ffd25fd70cce2a7b18&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Titans entered Sunday with a 5-0 record despite a coronavirus outbreak that the N.F.L. said the team mishandled.,3c28e94b-c0d5-5f6b-97ff-88cc10ce2a74,N24News/imgs/3c28e94b-c0d5-5f6b-97ff-88cc10ce2a74.jpg,9
Sports,Jimmy Butler Was Made for Miami,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/sports/basketball/nba-jimmy-butler-miami-heat.html,"Want more basketball in your inbox? Sign up for Marc Stein's weekly N.B.A. newsletter here. People laughed at the story about Jimmy Butler getting a visit from hotel security because he was dribbling a basketball too loudly in his room. They laughed at the idea of Butler peddling $20 cups of his branded coffee to his Miami Heat teammates. They laughed at how unruly his mustache got as he steadfastly refused to see a barber. So much about Butler's stay inside the N.B.A. bubble at Walt Disney World in Florida was a source of humor. For the first time in Butler's career, people were readily laughing along with him, because he was more effective and consistent than ever with the serious stuff. With the longest season in league history finally complete, it is no joke to assert that no player in the bubble enhanced his reputation as much as Butler did. Miami lost the N.B.A. finals to LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers in six games, but Butler -- playing for much of the series without the injured Bam Adebayo and Goran Dragic alongside him -- won the bubble as much as any individual could.

Will it last? Will the success and adulation change him? Or did we actually have it wrong about him all along? These are the sorts of questions Butler, 31, inspires now after a post-30, Steve Nash-ian breakthrough to elite status in his ninth season. ""Believe me when I tell you that I do not care what people say about me,"" Butler said. ""I truly don't care."" That was his message to me after Miami's first-round sweep of the Indiana Pacers, when Butler's forceful play turned what was supposed to be a heated showdown against the Pacers' T.J. Warren into a nonevent. My best read is that most people outside (and even inside) N.B.A. circles refuse to believe Butler when he says that, but he had me convinced after an afternoon visit in late August.

The esteem Butler holds among his peers -- which was high long before the bubble -- is such that he needn't worry much about how basketball pundits rate him. I saw it firsthand over the course of an hourlong sit-down with Butler in my favorite bubble hallway adjacent to three of the seven practice courts that sprouted on the N.B.A. campus. The hallway with the garish orange carpet at the Coronado Springs convention center was the only place in the bubble where reporters could expect to have unsupervised chance interactions with players, coaches and other team personnel. It was also a main thoroughfare to the meal rooms for the league's top teams, who were all staying at Disney's Gran Destino tower. While I talked with Butler, Milwaukee's Wes Matthews stopped by to reminisce with him about their days at Marquette. Pat Connaughton, Matthews' Bucks teammate, tried in vain to arrange a discount from Butler's Big Face Coffee venture, even though Milwaukee and Miami would soon begin a second-round playoff series. Boston Celtics Coach Brad Stevens made sure that Butler heard him say hello. After a number of Lakers players enthusiastically greeted Butler, Rajon Rondo lingered to rehash how dangerous they were together in Chicago in the 2017 playoffs. Rondo, Butler and the No. 8 Bulls took a surprising 2-0 series lead over the top-seeded Celtics that year by winning the first two games in Boston -- and let's just say they both strongly believe that the Celtics would have never rallied if Rondo hadn't fractured his right thumb in Game 2.

Combine all that with the unmitigated manner in which Miami has embraced Butler, abrasive as he can sometimes be, and I'm not sure he needs the public's validation. ""I'm so comfortable with being myself -- more than I've ever been,"" Butler said before the finals. ""Not saying I've ever not wanted to be myself, but now I know 'myself' is the right way."" ""He's such a likable guy,"" Heat Coach Erik Spoelstra said. ""He won't want anybody to know that, I guess. He's totally cool with the young guys growing -- he's not territorial about it at all. He's just about winning. He understands that he needs guys with him. All the big winners get that.""

Nothing, of course, speaks louder than the two-way brilliance Butler delivered against the Lakers and James after leading the Heat to the title round. Butler has also been criticized because he doesn't always play with the offensive aggression of a top-10 player, often preferring a more measured team game, but he found a new gear when Miami needed it most and became the first player in league history to record two triple-doubles in his first trip to the finals. Butler averaged a heady 29.0 points, 10.2 assists, 8.6 rebounds and 2.6 steals through the first five games before he wearily produced 12 points, 8 assists and 7 rebounds in the Game 6 finale. That Butler faded at the finish was understandable. He guarded James for nearly 43 minutes for the series; next in line were Adebayo and Andre Iguodala at eight-plus minutes each. Twice on the league's brightest stage, with James and Anthony Davis nearby, Butler was the best player on the floor. He also captained the team that, along with the Lakers, bonded the best in the bubble's demanding conditions. It would appear that Kawhi Leonard was on to something (I previously reported that he tried to persuade Butler to join him with the Los Angeles Clippers before the Clippers' pursuit of Paul George) and so were the Houston Rockets (they offered Minnesota four first-round picks to try to trade for Butler in October 2018). Further clues about Butler's stature were available -- some of us just didn't look in the right places. In September 2018, not long before he forced his way out of Minnesota via trade and stoked all the leaguewide chatter about how problematic he was, Butler received the key to the city in Tyler, Texas. The former Heisman Trophy winner and Pro Football Hall of Famer Earl Campbell was born in Tyler and played high school football there; Butler developed into a top college basketball prospect after one season at Tyler Junior College under Coach Mike Marquis. ""Even Earl Campbell doesn't have a key to the city,"" Marquis said.

Stein: One ring, I'm afraid, isn't enough to be considered a top-four Laker. I think even James would agree. The Lakers' first championship since 2010 is undeniably significant, given that James is only in his second season in Los Angeles -- and because the five years that preceded his arrival in Hollywood were the worst in franchise history. It is also a massive boost to LeBron's personal legacy to win N.B.A. finals Most Valuable Player Award honors with a third franchise -- something no other player has done. This ring and that distinction, combined with James's unmatched longevity as an elite force in this league, would nudge him to his own new level. James may never usurp Michael Jordan in the greatest-of-all-time debate. Yet I think we can safely declare, after what we've seen from LeBron in his 17th season and at age 35, that we have reached the point where it is difficult to consider anyone besides Jordan or James in the argument. Choosing the four greatest Lakers, though, is a completely different conversation. The competition is so fierce that the likes of Shaquille O'Neal, Wilt Chamberlain and Elgin Baylor can't crack it, either. Jerry West, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson and Kobe Bryant -- in whatever order you want to put them -- form the fabulous foursome that won't be easily supplanted. Not even by James. Q: Has anyone published an up-to-date listing of total career points in the N.B.A. -- regular-season games plus playoffs? -- David Pugh (Toledo, Ohio) Stein: We can easily do it, but it's not a stat that comes up often, presumably because old-school sticklers like me tend to insist on keeping regular-season and playoff numbers separate. With 40 points in Game 5, LeBron James indeed moved into second place in this combined category at 41,704, passing Karl Malone's 41,689. With 28 more points as part of James's Game 6 triple-double, he moved to 41,732.

This was just the 10th season out of 37, since the N.B.A.'s 16-team playoff format was introduced in 1983-84, that home teams won less than 60 percent of their playoff games. But that figure was well above .500 in each of the previous nine seasons it happened: .548 was the previous low for home teams, in 1988-89 and again in 1994-95. Jimmy Butler's three teams before Miami -- Chicago, Minnesota and Philadelphia -- have combined to win zero playoff games since Butler left, and only the Sixers have made the playoffs. Philadelphia was swept by Boston in this season's opening round after making it to the second round last season, where they almost defeated the eventual champion, Toronto. Joe Tsai, the Nets' owner and the executive vice chairman of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, donated 25 million yuan (roughly $3.7 million) in Covid-19 relief funds to China in February. The Nets announced the donation at the time on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. China's state television broadcaster, China Central Television, cited unspecified financial assistance from the N.B.A. in the country's fight against the coronavirus for its decision on Friday to lift a yearlong ban on televising N.B.A. games. Alvin Gentry, who last week joined the Sacramento Kings as associate head coach, has been an N.B.A. head coach with five teams. That includes his last stop in New Orleans and previous stints with Miami, Detroit, the Los Angeles Clippers and Phoenix.

Economy,"Fed Gives Banks a Break to Keep Markets Calm, Asking for Little in Return",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/business/economy/fed-banks-dividends-virus.html,"Fed Gives Banks a Break to Keep Markets Calm, Asking for Little in Return

In 2008, as the global financial system was melting down, America's largest banks continued paying dividends. Those shareholder payouts were made both by institutions that were holding up amid the storm, like Bank of America, and by companies that were teetering on the brink. Both Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch continued handing out piles of cash to prove that they were solvent. They were not. And those payouts left them weaker, exacerbating shortfalls that would ultimately cause their demise. As the coronavirus puts the financial system to its biggest test since 2008, there are growing concerns that the Federal Reserve is ignoring the costly and painful lessons of the last crisis by allowing banks to continue paying dividends.

While this crisis did not begin in the financial system, the virus is causing severe strain across various markets, and has at times made it hard to trade everything from corporate debt to Treasury securities. The Fed has rolled out programs to ensure that the inner workings of finance do not collapse and that banks can continue lending despite a severe downturn. Officials have loosened post-crisis rules put in place to ensure that banks had big enough financial cushions to continue lending, alongside other accommodations. They have relaxed borrowing caps, encouraged banks to dip into their extra layers of capital and liquidity, and are offering up cheap funding programs, all in an effort to encourage banks to keep making loans. Yet so far, policymakers have not stopped banks from continuing to pay dividends, allowing them to part with cash that could put them in a stronger position to continue serving as lenders and intermediaries should the unpredictable crisis deepen -- though such curbs remain a possibility. ""I don't think that's something that needs to be done at this point,"" Chair Jerome H. Powell said during a Brookings Institution webcast on April 9. ""We'll be watching to see how things evolve, but I don't think that step is appropriate at this time."" Big banks have voluntarily suspended stock buybacks for the time being, but they are loath to halt dividends because doing so could signal that their firm is in bad financial shape.

Dividends at the biggest banks will probably amount to about $40 billion this year, according to estimates by Gregg Gelzinis, a senior policy analyst at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. While substantial, that is less than what they will retain by halting share buybacks. If banks do not do any buybacks this year, it will probably give them an additional $150 billion in capital, he said. So far, they've committed to a two-quarter suspension, so are set to preserve about half that. While Mr. Powell does not appear ready to impose restrictions, minutes of the Fed's March 15 meeting show that some Fed officials believe the central bank should be making sure that firms hang on to all the cash that they can in an uncertain environment. ""Several participants commented that banks should be discouraged from repurchasing shares from, or paying dividends to, their equity holders,"" according to the minutes, which were released last week.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. And the Bank for International Settlements, which advises global central banks, said in a new brief that while a blanket restriction on payouts would ""reduce banks' attractiveness to investors,"" it would also ""limit the risk of signaling a bank's relative weakness."" Some former Fed officials agree that the central bank should consider constraining payouts. ""We learned that we let way too much money out the door in that crisis,"" Janet L. Yellen, the former Fed chair, said of 2008. She hasn't talked to Fed officials about their current thinking, but believes they should ask banks to halt dividends. ""We don't know where this is going, this is really a tail event and a great threat to the country."" If the Fed halts dividends while banks are still functioning normally, it would come across as precautionary to investors, said Daniel K. Tarullo, a former Fed governor and a key architect of much of the post-crisis bank regulatory regime. If it waits to take that step further down the road, when signs of financial system trouble are mounting, it could instead be read as a signal of trouble.

""At the early signs of what could be a major challenge, that's when you push the banks to husband their capital,"" he said. ""That is the time when it wouldn't have been a signal and would instead would be regarded as a hedge."" ""It is disappointing that this is not the course the Fed has taken,"" he said, adding that after the crisis, regulators learned that the ""playbook"" should be to suspend dividends and buybacks early. Banking groups say there is no need to stop paying dividends since the sector is in much stronger shape than it was headed into the 2008 crisis. ""There's no evidence of a need to suspend dividends based on the conditions of these institutions,"" Kevin Fromer, head of the Financial Services Forum, an advocacy group for large banks, said in an interview last week. Banks are already taking a beating amid the coronavirus pandemic. JPMorgan Chase & Company reported first-quarter earnings per share of 78 cents, less than half of what analysts were estimating, as reserve holdings mounted and markets gyrated. Wells Fargo's earnings per share dipped to just 1 cent and it set aside more money for credit losses, it said Tuesday. But the firms do have more capital to get them through tough times than they did before the 2008 financial crisis, thanks to post-crisis regulatory changes. Fed leaders have become more bank-friendly under the Trump administration, which, paired with the industry's improved financial position, is probably driving the reluctance to cut dividends. Instead of reining in payouts, Fed officials have actually made changes that allow banks to continue making them. Banks are generally allowed to dip into their capital buffers in times of stress, and are encouraged to do that to support lending and spending. But they avoid doing so, because it activates regulations that require them to cut dividends.

On March 17, the Fed said it would make those restrictions phase in more gradually to encourage banks to use the buffer. Weeks later, the central bank's Board of Governors in Washington said it would change a key regulation -- the supplementary leverage ratio, which gauges capital held against assets -- for a year. Banks are no longer required to count their holdings of Treasuries and cash deposits at the Fed toward the ratio, which will allow big banks to lower their capital by about 2 percent. The Fed probably had to make some sort of leverage ratio tweak. The central bank is pumping reserves, bank holdings at the Fed, into the financial system as it makes giant bond purchases to smooth markets. That, paired with an influx of deposits as investors cash out their investments, has saturated bank balance sheets. When banks hold too many assets (like Treasury bonds) relative to capital (common stock and retained earnings), they avoid taking on more and throwing their regulatory ratios out of whack. In the current environment, that could disrupt markets. If banks are not willing to snap up Treasury bonds as the government unleashes a flood of them to pay for its $2 trillion coronavirus relief package, the Fed would have to buy bonds even more aggressively or risk a meltdown. If banks serve as go-betweens, holding the bonds for a time, Treasuries can find their way into household investment portfolios. Absorption is easier. But the change gives big banks, which have long detested the leverage ratio, a major win. And while it is temporary, industry experts speculate that banks will push hard to make sure it never changes back. There is clearly nervousness at the Fed that the newly free capital could be used to ramp up payouts. The central bank's statement cautioned that the change was to allow banks ""to serve as financial intermediaries, rather than to allow banking organizations to increase capital distributions."" It said it will ""administer the interim final rule accordingly.""","The Federal Reserve is giving banks room to maneuver with regulatory tweaks.

Books,The Civil Rights Movement Photographer Who Was Also an F.B.I. Informant,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/books/review/preston-lauterbach-bluff-city.html,"When Ernest Withers was a press photographer in Memphis in the mid-1950s, he put a slogan on his business cards: PICTURES TELL THE STORY. Indeed they did. He was no effete aesthete; he was a working reporter, one whose job was to get there, get in close, get the powerful shot and (if all went well) get paid. He was African-American, often publishing in The Chicago Defender and Jet magazine; drawn toward the biggest story around, he was soon covering the civil rights movement. And because he was good at his job, those pictures have vigor and punch. At the trial of Emmett Till's murderers, he defied a judge's no-cameras order and got off one quick, sharp frame as an accuser fingered one of the killers. He hung around a local blues club and photographed the rising star Elvis Presley as he soaked up the local musical culture he later reinterpreted for the rest of the world. He was with Martin Luther King Jr. aboard one of the first integrated bus rides in Montgomery, Ala., in 1956, and he was there when King lay in a funeral home in 1968.

Which made it all the more astounding when, a few years after his death in 2007, the truth came out. Starting in the early 1960s, Withers had spent nearly two decades as a paid informant of the F.B.I., feeding its agents information about the activists he photographed. He not only informed; he took requests. At one anti-Vietnam War march, he was asked to photograph all of the 30-odd protesters, taking special care to catch all their faces, and he turned 80 8-by-10 prints over to his F.B.I. contact. On occasion, he sold his work to a local paper, then gave copies to the bureau. His daughter Rosalind, the youngest of his nine children and the one who handles his estate, was blindsided when the news came out via a series of FOIA requests and legal fights undertaken by Marc Perrusquia, a reporter from The Commercial Appeal in Memphis. Perrusquia wrote about Withers and the revelation of his intelligence work in his own book, ""A Spy in Canaan,"" which was published last year. It's a smart journalist's book, crisply marching through Withers's F.B.I. records and the paper's battle to pry them out of the government's grip. ""Bluff City,"" by Preston Lauterbach, aims instead for something less snappy and more lyrical. Its subtitle is ""The Secret Life of Photographer Ernest Withers,"" which suggests that it's a biography, but it isn't quite that, or at least not a comprehensive one. Big stretches of Withers's life get a fairly cursory look, and Lauterbach basically calls it a day after King's assassination in 1968, dispatching the photographer's subsequent four decades in an introductory chapter and an afterword. Nor is this a book about photography history, examining the photographs the way an art historian might. There are 18 pictures, most, though not all, by Withers, enough to hit the main points but no more. (Which is fine. Decisions about including photos in a book like this tend to be limited by the cost of rights, and anyway there are several nice volumes of Withers's pictures out there. Or, you know, Google.) Instead what Lauterbach, a former Memphis resident and the author of two other books set in the South, ""Beale Street Dynasty"" and ""The Chitlin' Circuit,"" is going for is a loose, rangy history of the civil rights movement in Memphis, using Withers and his camera as the (literal) lens. He's done the work, tracking the complex, intertwined dances of the radicals and the centrists, the local ministers and visiting heavyweights like King. Weirdly, though, his very thoroughness and deep interest in this time and place have the almost certainly unintended effect of diminishing Withers rather than keeping him front and center. There are long stretches where, say, Stokely Carmichael appears, and we get 10 enthusiastic pages about his politics and S.N.C.C. and the dynamics between Carmichael and King, and then Withers pokes his head in to snap a few pictures and go meet his F.B.I. contact. Some of those scenes are nicely wrought, but the secrets in this life are often other people's rather than Withers's own.

The narrative tightens up and gains momentum as it builds toward that deadly evening at the Lorraine Motel. Much of the book is structured around the final days of King's life, as he tried to manage a sanitation strike in Memphis that turned violent, leaving him dejected. That was the protest at which Withers shot his best-known photo, of a line of strikers bearing signs that read I AM A MAN. The men are carrying the signs on sticks that Withers himself helped saw, and when the march turned violent, those pine two-by-twos became weapons. (Lauterbach expends some energy trying to figure out whether Withers had supplied them in hopes of creating a stir.) A week later, Withers was not on the scene when King was shot, although he arrived shortly after. Those famous pictures of King's associates, pointing toward the direction of the rifle shot? Withers didn't take them, but the young South African photographer who did, Joseph Louw, was too rattled to develop them himself, and nearly botched the processing. Withers stepped into the darkroom alongside him and made sure it got done right. The central question a reader is likely to ask of this book (and of Perrusquia's as well) is: Why did a man whose life and work were knitted into the civil rights movement feed information to J. Edgar Hoover? The F.B.I. director's explicit goals, after all, were to disrupt all the organizing, to drain the movement's influence, to humiliate and destroy King. Lauterbach has a few theories, and all are probably true to varying degrees. For one thing, Withers needed the money. He raised his big family on a freelance photographer's pay, and put most of his kids through college. (Some civil rights activists from the era say that, since they were operating in the open, Withers was not betraying them but simply conning the F.B.I. for some cash.) For another, he disliked the anti-American language on the fringier end of the left, especially when it turned communistic. He was preternaturally inclined toward a law-and-order point of view. In fact, he'd been a cop before he was a photographer, and a crooked one at that. In the early 1950s, he left the Memphis Police Department involuntarily, after he'd been caught selling illegal liquor under the table. Twenty-four years later, he was appointed to the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Board -- and then was stung again, this time by the F.B.I. itself, as he worked a scheme to get a prisoner out of jail in exchange for a cash payment to the governor. ""Bluff City"" may not get to Withers's inner life, but it is not without pleasure. Lauterbach is justifiably sympathetic to his subject, noting that one has to be generous about judging the things a black man in the Jim Crow South did to get by. (Withers was beaten during at least one march he covered.) And Lauterbach likes the other central character in the book even better, that being Memphis itself. In his first chapter, he describes a day in 2005 when he dropped by Withers's studio for a tour and got a lift home from the photographer in that old sedan. ""He drove -- in a manner many people familiar with Memphis will recognize -- slowly, drifting right."" That kind of describes his book, too.","""Bluff City,"" by Preston Lauterbach, delves into the double life of Ernest Withers, one of the era's great documentarians.",1aedc2a0-1efa-5d78-97c8-250082eab35c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/20/books/review/20Bonanos1/20Bonanos1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=441af8dfe40dc0404d5f615c1e18f2253c073b40eb90ec634dd5bfb7b3a885db&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Ernest Withers's photograph of a march in Memphis in 1968 after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.,1aedc2a0-1efa-5d78-97c8-250082eab35c,N24News/imgs/1aedc2a0-1efa-5d78-97c8-250082eab35c.jpg,13
Television,Comics Select Their Audiences as Carefully as Their Jokes,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/arts/television/comedians-fred-armisen-drummers.html,"In his new Netflix special, ""Standup for Drummers,"" Fred Armisen adopts the distinctively skeptical tone of an observational comedian when asking, ""Do we ever need to bring our own cymbals?"" The audience, made up exclusively of drummers, chuckles. Minutes later, he cracks another rhetorical joke: ""Is it me or is it just so hard to get a snare drum to be exactly the right way?"" It's not just him, but I confess I have no idea what he's talking about. I recognize the rhythms of the joke, and can tease out the general meaning with the help of context, but as a nondrummer, this joke is not intended for me. Nor does it need to be.

There's an old-school belief that great comedy should work for all audiences. It's never been entirely true. Taste varies wildly, and some of the best comedy, like the finest film or theater or art, can be obscure, esoteric or simply too odd, dirty or absurd to attract the biggest crowds. But in a splintered culture, where there are more options than ever catering to a multitude of types and inclinations, comedians are increasingly aiming for narrower niches.

""Standup for Drummers"" is the logical extension of this trend, a special representative of the moment, when you create your jokes but also curate your crowd. Of course you don't need to be in that room of drummers to see his special, which is what makes watching it on Netflix disorienting. Mr. Armisen, the ""Portlandia"" star who's also a drummer, delivers his material as if everyone is deeply conversant with double-kick drum pedals and high hats. He appears to want to be relatable, even when he isn't. At times, that makes it seem as if he's doing a spoof, poking fun at the kind of hipster-in-a-bubble character he often lampoons on the IFC series ""Portlandia,"" currently in its eighth and final season. And there is a knowing wink here. But the more you watch, the more his set comes across as a genuine labor of love, comedy he hopes everyone likes, even though it really just caters to a small segment. And what's wrong with that? Drummers laugh, too, and material about them isn't exactly everywhere. You won't find any other stand-up special with imitations of Keith Moon, Meg White and Larry Mullen Jr.; or one that pokes fun at the lighting in instructional videos for drummers. And for those who don't know anything about this world, there is fun to be had observing this clubby atmosphere from the outside. Mr. Armisen has long been a bridge between the comedy and music worlds, after his 11 years on ""Saturday Night Live"" with a job as the bandleader on ""Late Night With Seth Meyers."" On ""Portlandia,"" he has done sketches filled with musicians like one this year about a reunion of aging punk rockers, which starred Henry Rollins, Krist Novoselic (formerly of Nirvana) and the Fugazi drummer Brendan Canty. Some of ""Standup for Drummers"" operates as an entertaining history lesson, as when he plays a series of drum kits from different decades, describing how the instrument has changed.

Mr. Armisen is much more seasoned as a sketch performer and actor than a stand-up and it often shows. His setups are repetitive, his transitions awkward and some of the jokes aren't fully formed. A bit about how he doesn't like blues isn't much more than that. ""Aren't crazy people crazy?"" is a line that should be cut. But someone with such diverse talents would be wasted toiling away at a comedy club. Mr. Armisen's jokes are at their best when they bleed into sketches, when they lean on characters rather than punch lines in his own voice. In one premise, he says that doo-wop was once considered as edgy and angry as heavy metal. Then he puts on some doo-wop music and imagines what a kid from the 1950s getting his mind blown would look like. His performance is all flailing limbs and coiled attitude, evoking a whole type in a few brief flourishes. It's something Mr. Armisen specializes in -- look at his brief appearance as Michael Wolff, the author of ""Fire and Fury,"" on a recent episode of ""Saturday Night Live."" The skit captures his devil-may-carelessness in a flip of the hand.

Part of what makes him gifted at these caricatures is his perceptive ear for the eccentric ways people talk, pointing out oddball pieces of rhetoric and habits of speech. He also displays a gift for accents. At one point, he puts up a video of a map of America and goes state by state, demonstrating the accent of every major city in the country. It's a marvel, and not entirely off point, since local differences are the kind of thing bands on tour know. It doesn't seem like a joke so much as a feat, and yet he's summing up entire regions with a slight change in intonation or affect. This is fairly subtle work, the kind that also reminds you that we're living in a big, complex country where even people in neighboring states talk differently.

There's something wonderful about the idea of trying to speak to everyone. But in our divided, siloed culture, who really believes that's possible? Just as politicians play to their base, comedians now find their specific audiences, and because of social media and podcasts, they can communicate with them more directly than ever. The future of comedy is not in the size of your crowd, but in the depth of its passion. And the connection between performer and fan can be cemented with inside jokes, the shared, exclusive language of close friends. Something is lost in this shift away from monoculture and into aesthetic alcoves, but only the rigidly nostalgic will insist nothing has been gained.",Fred Armisen's new special is the ultimate example of niche comedy: gags about drummers aimed at a crowd made up entirely of drummers.,cd030f4b-f2ec-59fe-a4de-c8ae1436586d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/06/arts/06FRED-ARMISEN/06FRED-ARMISEN-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=212e90e0f943c3dcdfd11f47e1bd3760753c16c927f032cf5b0fffa4df776a3b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Fred Armisen in his debut special, &ldquo;Standup for Drummers.&rdquo;",cd030f4b-f2ec-59fe-a4de-c8ae1436586d,N24News/imgs/cd030f4b-f2ec-59fe-a4de-c8ae1436586d.jpg,3
Movies,'Graves Without a Name' Review: An Impossible Quest in Cambodia,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/movies/graves-without-a-name-review.html,"For years, people in the arts or in journalism have, in conversation, said of their vocation, ""I didn't choose it; it chose me."" At times this is an at least half-glib attempt to rationalize the often nonremunerative nature of their endeavors. But the truism gains some heft if looked at from a different angle.

Consider the film artists whose work could not escape, even had they wanted it to, a world-historic trauma that also had a profound personal meaning for them. One thinks of Claude Lanzmann and the Holocaust. One wonders what the Russian filmmaker Aleksei German would have done had Stalin never existed, or what the filmmaker Edward Yang's oeuvre might look like had the specter of the militaristic Kuomintang government not haunted it.

Yang and German were fiction filmmakers. Lanzmann was a documentarian. The Cambodian-born director Rithy Panh, whose impetus for filmmaking was Pol Pot, works in both fiction and documentaries; the documentaries are especially distinctive and imaginative, and in recent years, more and more personal.

Panh's father was a minister of education in the regime preceding that of the Khmer Rouge, which brutalized his family after coming to power. Panh escaped Cambodia as a teenager and discovered filmmaking during his education in France. His 2014 feature ""The Missing Picture"" grappled with his family tragedy and depicted its personages, including his mother and father, in the form of artful clay figurines.","The filmmaker Rithy Panh attempts to find where his parents, victims of the Khmer Rouge, are buried.",23a7b8dc-653f-5287-b17a-5d26304f64f6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/14/arts/14graveswithout/14graveswithout-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=db25c408dda0256513d62b43b36b3e08abaf2a06046ec5f778f67acae3bd78ea&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A scene from ""Graves Without a Name,"" a documentary directed by Rithy Panh.",23a7b8dc-653f-5287-b17a-5d26304f64f6,N24News/imgs/23a7b8dc-653f-5287-b17a-5d26304f64f6.jpg,5
Opinion,"A Suicide, an App and a Time for a Reckoning",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/opinion/robinhood-suicide-trading.html,"I spent a lot of time this week trying to come up with the best way to get those who make things in Silicon Valley to better understand the suicide of Alex Kearns, a student at the University of Nebraska. He killed himself after he mistakenly believed that he had a $730,000 negative balance on the millennial-popular Robinhood app, which he had downloaded to learn about investing. The tragedy got a lot of attention, especially after Forbes reported that Mr. Kearns left a note behind asking, ""How was a 20-year-old with no income able to get assigned almost a million dollars of leverage?"" Embedded in that query is a much bigger one that has been plaguing the tech industry and its innovative entrepreneurs for far too long: What is the reason for their persistent tendency to ignore the potentially dangerous impact of their creations? These days the companies can seem not just careless but also predatory. Is it to make more money? Is it because growth trumps safety? Is it rank sloppiness? Lack of foresight? A design flaw that could have and, more to the point, should have been anticipated? A laser focus on innovation? All of the above?

Perhaps the reason hardly matters, since, as Robert Louis Stevenson wrote, ""Everybody, soon or late, sits down at a banquet of consequences."" And that is the ashen meal now in front of Robinhood's co-founders and co-chief executives, Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt. The company, based in Menlo Park, Calif., has become a phenom since its founding in 2013. Using an addictive and hyper-gamified interface, seamless and instant onboarding to the glories of trading and an occasional dollop of animated confetti to jack up the fun factor, Robinhood use has grown fast among young people, many of whom are newbies to investing. While there have been troubling outages and worries that the app has been designed to feel more like a casino than a sober pathway for important financial decisions, the longtime idea of democratizing entrance to the stock market -- I covered the advent of popular online trading companies like eTrade in the late 1990s -- is an important one. And there is no doubt that Robinhood has been among the most innovative standouts in the fintech space (especially in removing friction, which is at the heart of this app, and in offering new features like fractional shares). That success has attracted $1.2 billion in investments from eager venture capital firms, including $280 million last month from the top-tier investor Sequoia Capital, bringing Robinhood's valuation to $8.3 billion.

And the pandemic has been a boon to the company, making it a good bet for investors. Robinhood has added an astonishing three million accounts in the first quarter of this year, bringing the total to 13 million. A growth chart that goes up and to the right is all well and good, but has Robinhood, as one person said to me, ""made the classic Silicon Valley mistake of applying games and brain hacks to an extremely important sector,"" even as it underinvested in key parts of the business like customer service? Robinhood has certainly doubled down on eliminating friction, which in Silicon Valley is almost like a religious tenet. Too many clicks are akin to a major sin to techies, as are too many ""just a sec"" warnings, even though most people find stop signs useful if irritating in real life. It's not clear yet how things went awry in Mr. Kearns's case, except that the way the app rendered his account before his death appeared to make him think that he was deep in a financial hole. Of his own accord, he was engaged in complex options trading, but without much oversight on the transactions and without enough information about options trading on the app. All added up, the calculation proved deadly for him. Options trading can be very risky -- and is not recommended for the inexperienced investor like Mr. Kearns. To do it, Robinhood requires an eligibility questionnaire and for a user to certify his investing experience, along with signing an acknowledgment of risk and a promise to read its materials on the topic. Other brokerage firms provide more substantive interactions on their riskiest financial instruments and even offer to explain risks in real-time conversations before allowing an investment to proceed. One investor I spoke with likened the Robinhood experience to giving a Ferrari to a kid without a driver's license. That kind of carelessness is especially problematic when it comes to young men, who studies have shown are more attracted to online trading, especially because of its often addictive characteristics, and whose emotional investment can be too high. In an interview with me this week, Mr. Tenev said the company could not comment on the specifics of Mr. Kearns's account because of privacy concerns. But clearly chastened and shaken by the tragedy, he acknowledged that fast growth has been a management issue.

""We had our challenges and had not anticipated 2020 shaking out the way it did,"" Mr. Tenev said. ""Customer support has been strained, but the team has been hiring."" A company representative said Robinhood had grown its customer service department by over 40 percent already this year, which has included adding registered financial-services professionals. And the company says it wants to double its customer service staff by the end of the year. Mr. Tenev stressed again what he and Mr. Bhatt had written about Mr. Kearns in an unusually self-critical blog post: Robinhood announced a commitment to more investment in app education resources, significant changes in its interface around options and a $250,000 donation to suicide prevention. ""It is certainly not lost upon us that Robinhood, especially with retail investing in America, has recognized that we have a huge responsibility,"" he said. ""We want to be out in front of issues and be the best and safest options platform."" Still, some think Robinhood failed Mr. Kearns. Bill Brewster, a professional investor whose wife is Mr. Kearns's cousin, said the young man appeared excited and eager to learn about investing. It was Mr. Brewster who raised Robinhood's failures in the Kearns matter on Twitter. While he gave the company credit for its response and some of the moves it says it is going to make, Mr. Brewster remains worried that Robinhood does not understand or appreciate its responsibilities. ""You are playing with real fire to allow inexperienced people to play with the riskiest of financial instruments,"" he said. ""There is always personal responsibility, of course. But as a society, I think we owe youth some sort of oversight, and it feels like someone was asleep at the wheel there.""",Companies like the stock-trading app Robinhood can seem not just careless but also predatory.,14440a84-16ac-56f2-ba6e-c62b86ac711c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/25/opinion/25swisher1/25swisher1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=6435fad73bef5f6b9eeb098193072a05ff91a82b994c5d49b3516e2b7793a8de&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Robinhood investment app is seen on a smartphone.,14440a84-16ac-56f2-ba6e-c62b86ac711c,N24News/imgs/14440a84-16ac-56f2-ba6e-c62b86ac711c.jpg,11
Sports,No Punishment for Russia Over Delay on Doping Data,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/sports/olympics/wada-russia.html,"The World Anti-Doping Agency's executive committee declined on Monday to punish Russia's antidoping watchdog even though the Russian Antidoping Agency missed an end-of-year deadline to hand over data on 10,000 suspicious doping samples. WADA's team in Moscow was eventually allowed into the laboratory which held the data, and last week WADA announced that the team had successfully obtained all data. ""Collecting the all-important data is a critical step, and it was not easy to achieve,"" Craig Reedie, WADA's president, said in a statement. ""We are not yet at the finishing line and there is a lot more to do but undeniably we are much further along the track."" The data, assuming it has not been tampered with, is key to getting to the roots of Russia's vast, decade-long conspiracy to corrupt the system of performance enhancing drug testing in international sports. The whistle blower Grigory Rodchenkov, the former leader of Moscow's antidoping lab, exposed the corruption in 2015.

In September, WADA's executive committee voted to reinstate the Russian Antidoping Agency, despite it not having yet met all of the conditions for reinstatement. That decision was vociferously opposed by athletes, and WADA's own vice president voted against it. Reedie added in the statement: ""Several members of the ExCo voiced their disappointment that the deadline had been missed but agreed that no sanction in that regard should be imposed."" The executive committee's decision followed a recommendation by WADA's influential compliance review committee that ""no further action"" was recommended. The recommendation says that noncompliance should be pursued only as a last resort, and in all cases if a ""nonconformity"" is corrected quickly, no sanction should be imposed. ""The critical point was to get the Analytical Data, and that has now happened,"" wrote Jonathan Taylor, chair of the compliance review committee, in the recommendation. WADA also announced that an audit of the Russian Antidoping Agency, another condition of continued reinstatement, was completed in early December with ""very positive"" results.

The next major step is for WADA to confirm the authenticity of the 20 terabytes of data that was collected from the Laboratory Information Management System and central backup servers. WADA's extraction team in Moscow confirmed that the data can be opened and read, but not that every expected record is present and full. That process is expected to take two to three months, and the compliance review committee will receive an update every two weeks. If the data is found to have been tampered with, the compliance review committee will meet immediately and most likely recommend that the executive committee serve Russia with a notice of noncompliance. The consequences for that notice would ""very likely"" include banning Russia from hosting any world championships, as well as banning Russian athletes from competing in the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Russian athletes are still not allowed to participate in international track and field events. Assuming the data is authenticated and any athletes who are suspected of breaching antidoping rules are identified, their cases will be handed over to the international sports federations that govern their sports to pursue sanctions. Russia will also have to hand over any physical samples still stored in the Moscow laboratory that WADA wishes to reanalyze by June 30.",Russia missed the deadline for turning over data on its doping program by nearly three weeks.

Theater,A Musical About Slobodan Milosevic Stirs Memories in Kosovo,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/theater/slobodan-milosevic-musical-kosovo.html,"The Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic died during his trial for war crimes at The Hague in 2006. So his reincarnation in a glossy tracksuit for an experimental Serbian musical this week in Kosovo has provoked complicated feelings in the majority Albanian country.

""The Lift: The Slobodan Show"" tracks the autocrat's rise, focusing on his family relationships, particularly with his wife, Mirjana, and ends with his trial in The Hague. It is interspersed with accounts from the Serbian actors of their own memories of life under Milosevic in the 1990s. It premiered on Tuesday to applause, tears, and a few walkouts.

""A lot of people cried yesterday,"" said the show's director, Nenad Todorovic, in a telephone interview on Wednesday. ""A few of them left the show very angry. Half of them were delighted.""

""It's a weird kind of musical,"" he added, ""not like your Broadway musicals.""

Art & Design,What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/arts/design/what-to-see-in-new-york-art-galleries-this-week.html,"As seen in this marvel of a show in Greenwich Village, Paul Bloodgood (1960-2018) pursued poetry and painting with equal intensity and a lyricism grounded in the physical. In both pursuits, he excelled at turning the efforts of others into his own. His verses are scrappily beautiful collage-poems achieved by cutting, pasting, excising and mating words and phrases by different writers into seamless meditations on humanity, death and art. For example ""Study for Jack's Name Painting"" (2008-11) begins with a line from a Robert Musil essay and segues into words from Ray Carney's book on the films of John Cassavetes. The first line of another poem crucially alters Theodor Adorno's famous insistence that ""every work of art is an uncommitted crime."" Mr. Bloodgood changed ""crime"" to ""repetition,"" asserting that his art does not commit repetition.

This is confirmed by ""X After 1000"" (2000), Mr. Bloodgood's version of a Chinese landscape ink painting. It is a towering exaltation of oil paint, with each rock, bush, cliff and tree given its own colors and texture, while waterfalls of pure white cut among them. Several works here seem to riff on this painting, dismantling it, abstracting it and flooding it with white, as in ""Study for Composition by Field,"" from 2008. In other canvases, planes of color and areas of white balance landscape and abstraction behind scaffoldings of green lines. The latest painting is from around 2017, when Mr. Bloodgood was suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's. It is a field of thick, scratched white with a scumbled wedge of red ocher pushing in from the right. Relatively simple, possibly unfinished, it still conveys the natural intensity of Mr. Bloodgood's hand.

In addition to being a poet-painter, Mr. Bloodgood in 1989 helped found and operate the artist-run gallery AC Project Room (with Alissa Friedman and the sculptor Anne Chu, among others), which continued at different addresses until 2001. AC gave early shows to several stellar artists, including Ms. Chu, Matthew Ritchie, Isa Genzken and Josiah McElheny, and its history is touched on here by three vitrines of ephemera. The photographs, letters and announcement cards attest that Mr. Bloodgood favored collaboration in life as well as in art.

Always a subtle and witty cultural commentator, Lutz Bacher lands right on the political money with this solo show, organized by Nicola Lees and Robert Snowden at 80WSE Gallery. ""The Long March,"" installed in the gallery itself, is made up of dozens of small, same-size, no-two-alike photographic images of Mao Zedong. Commercially printed in China, the series is a mass-produced exercise in personality-cult promotion. Mao, young or old, often dressed in military gray (the gallery walls are painted the same color) greets officials or chats up peasants in one staged scene after another. Because the images are clearly advertising, it's tempting to take them in at a sweep, but considering them one by one is instructive. It lets you experience the mechanics of persuasion. Visual repetition -- the face, the hair, the uniform -- can cast a spell. We may believe that Mao was, for much of his career, a monster, but when we see him over and over playing benign, made-for-the-camera-roles, we can lose sight of that. He becomes a legend, a star, a part of our history. He may be awful, but he's our very own awful, the awful we love to hate.

A second solo exhibition by this artist, ""Open the Kimono,"" which closed in its original form on Sept. 1, was presented as a photographic slide show in a New York University lecture hall several blocks away from Washington Square. All the photographs were of scraps of paper on which the artist had jotted down phrases lifted from radio talk shows, advertisements and overheard conversations. Some of the phrases (""I believe in love"") were bland-inane; others (""Facelift in minutes at home"") were pop-weird; still others (""You interested in brown girls specifically?"") creepily personal; and more than a few (""Enhanced interrogation techniques,"" ""We are in a post-truth environment"") were direct references to current politics. Together, they added up to the equivalent of handwritten tweets, a random harvest of outtakes from the surreality show that is American culture right now. The book version of the exhibition -- a slide lecture translated into a textbook, you might say -- will be celebrated on Saturday evening at the gallery.

For several decades, Andy Warhol was the patron saint of artists obsessed with mass media and celebrity culture, a fixation he expressed to the mainstream in a deadpan, affectless demeanor. For the current generation, that title may be shifting to the underground filmmaker and performance artist Jack Smith (1932-89). Mr. Smith is best known for the films ""Flaming Creatures"" (1962-63) and ""Normal Love"" (1963-65), which gained immediate notoriety because of the obscenity charges leveled against them. ""Jack Smith: Art Crust of Spiritual Oasis,"" at Artists Space, expands that view beyond the 1960s with work made from the '70s until his death, of AIDS-related causes, in 1989.

Some of the photographs and ephemera here relate to the Plaster Foundation of Atlantis, a loft on Greene Street to which Mr. Smith moved in 1969, and which he turned into a kind of theater, with performances every Saturday at midnight. ""Third critic-free week!"" one flier boasts. Other drawings and posters include barbs against landlords and the market-driven art world (Mr. Smith was later evicted from that loft for not paying rent); there's also a hand-scrawled syllabus revealing his deep knowledge of film. Creatures like lobsters, cockroaches and sharks serve as alter egos and characters in his work. Material relating to the performance ""It Could Begin With Art"" (1974) includes photographs and German television footage of Mr. Smith in the role of an eagle named Ronald De Carlo, walking around the zoo in Cologne, Germany, collecting ""rent"" from the animals. ""In Search of Sinbad,"" an unfinished epic film project started in the late '70s, features costume designs that imagine Sinbad morphing into a leopard. A poster for the performance ""I Danced With a Penguin"" (1983) describes Mr. Smith as an ""exotic theatrical genius,"" which feels surprisingly accurate. He was also very camp, a sensibility Susan Sontag (a fan of Mr. Smith's) detailed in her famous essay ""Notes on Camp"" (1964). In Sontag's view, camp is exemplified by the exaggerated and artificial and is important because it ""neutralizes moral indignation, sponsors playfulness."" Our era is all about the exaggerated and artificial: hyper-posed selfies, hybrid identities, drag-queen reality shows. And suddenly Mr. Smith's playful excess, once deemed obscene, feels prescient and perfect.",Paul Bloodgood's collage-poems; Lutz Bacher's examination of Mao Zedong's cult of personality; and a Jack Smith retrospective at Artists Space.,e2077d65-afcc-5fad-aa67-9e17c46a5dfe,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/07/arts/07galleries1/07galleries1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=2699d41e8e32392f43a26b4f79ed1f7fdbc62d7773da6a45ff80edea03f5560f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"&ldquo;X After 1000,&rdquo; from 2000, Paul Bloodgood&rsquo;s version of a Chinese landscape ink painting.",e2077d65-afcc-5fad-aa67-9e17c46a5dfe,N24News/imgs/e2077d65-afcc-5fad-aa67-9e17c46a5dfe.jpg,14
Science,How to Watch the Total Solar Eclipse,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/science/how-to-watch-the-solar-eclipse.html,"With protective glasses at the ready, skywatchers across Southeast Asia and the western Pacific are preparing to witness a total solar eclipse. But you don't have to live in those parts of the world to observe it. With only a few hours before the cosmic spectacle starts, here are answers to some questions you might have.

When does the eclipse begin?

Observers in the first places where the total eclipse will be viewable will see it around midnight G.M.T. on Wednesday (7 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday) and those in the last places to witness it will do so around 4 a.m. G.M.T. (11 p.m. Eastern).

How can I watch the eclipse from the other side of the world?

Starting at 6 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday (11 p.m. G.M.T.) the Slooh Community Observatory, which operates a global network of telescopes, will begin broadcasting the eclipse live from Tadulako University in Palu, Indonesia. From their vantage point, the moon will commence consuming the sun at 7:37 p.m. Eastern, casting its entire shadow across the sky for about 2 minutes and 4 seconds.","Skywatchers across Southeast Asia and the western Pacific can witness a solar eclipse.

Technology,Sony Removes Cyberpunk 2077 From PlayStation Store After Complaints,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/18/technology/cyberpunk-2077-refund.html,"Sony, the company that owns and operates PlayStation, announced late Thursday that it would offer refunds to people who purchased Cyberpunk 2077 and remove what had been one of the year's most highly anticipated video games from its online store, after a week of negative reviews and criticism from users over its poor performance.

In a statement on PlayStation's website, Sony said it would offer full refunds to users who purchased the game through the PlayStation Store. Cyberpunk 2077, the company said, would also be removed from the store until further notice. Microsoft, the company that owns Xbox, announced on Friday that it would also be offering refunds to people who purchased Cyberpunk 2077 through the Microsoft store.

The game retails for $59.99, and its developer, CD Projekt Red, had touted receiving eight million pre-orders of the game.

CD Projekt Red said Friday that Sony's decision to ""temporarily suspend"" sales of the game came after a discussion with the company, which is based in Warsaw.","Both Sony and Microsoft, the maker of Xbox, said they would also offer refunds to gamers while the developer of the much-hyped title works to fix bugs and glitches.",9e8a704f-551a-5397-9d9a-5d4d556452c8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/18/world/18xp-cyberpunk/18xp-cyberpunk-facebookJumbo.jpg,Sony announced Friday that it would remove Cyberpunk 2077 from its PlayStation Store and offer refunds to gamers.,9e8a704f-551a-5397-9d9a-5d4d556452c8,N24News/imgs/9e8a704f-551a-5397-9d9a-5d4d556452c8.jpg,20
Opinion,John Lewis's Plea to Young Americans,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/opinion/letters/john-lewis-civil-rights.html,"Re ""Together, You Can Redeem the Soul of Our Nation,"" by John Lewis (Op-Ed, July 30):

Working in Montgomery, Ala., I have walked on the trails that many of our civil rights heroes forged and I have listened to the stories of unspeakable violence but also unimaginable courage. But I have never felt compelled to act -- not until May 25. George Floyd was my Emmett Till. In those 8 minutes and 46 seconds, I heard the cries of my ancestors that came before me and the cries of my descendants to come. It was as if I could reach into the past and stretch into the future to gain the strength I needed to say enough is enough.

I encourage all people, regardless of race, to say enough is enough. We as a people must, as John Lewis put it, get into good trouble, necessary trouble. Mr. Lewis has given us his last(ing) words of wisdom, and to me, these words have meaning, these words hold power.

We must not, as Mr. Lewis said, let fear constrain us like an imaginary prison. Our nation, and indeed our world, deserves better. Now is the time to embrace his words and to use them as a catalyst for change. We can repair the soul of our nation, but we can do so only as a unified force -- as one nation.

Thank you so much for publishing this powerful call from John Lewis from beyond the grave, exhorting us to continue the struggle for peace and justice for all! How can we ignore such an eloquent case made by one who devoted his life and blood to this cause and lived this commitment every day of his life?","Readers are moved by an Op-Ed piece he wrote days before his death, urging people to ""stand up for what you truly believe.""",b75c44e9-2eb4-5a7b-bec0-d6c245dae466,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/30/opinion/30lletterWEb/30lletterWEb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=9927e172ea714236d25f3518aa6e5c3edc7381d99fc7185841de8a9a848b5870&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"John Lewis in Selma, Ala., in 2015.",b75c44e9-2eb4-5a7b-bec0-d6c245dae466,N24News/imgs/b75c44e9-2eb4-5a7b-bec0-d6c245dae466.jpg,11
Automobiles,And Plug-In Makes Four: Prius's Expanding Family,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/automobiles/autoreviews/and-plug-in-makes-four-priuss-expanding-family.html,"THE Toyota Prius may not be a sex magnet, but it provokes strong reactions often bordering on love or hate. These emotional responses helped Toyota establish its original hybrid car as a niche vehicle with a devoted following. But there is now an entire line of Priuses designed to be less polarizing and more attuned to the needs of middle-of-the-road Americans. In other words, as it has gone mainstream, the Prius has been Camryfied. Since last summer, the familiar compact liftback version has been joined by the Prius V wagon, the Prius C subcompact and now the Prius Plug-in Hybrid. It is not so easy to spot the new Priuses from blocks away -- useful for avoidance maneuvers that can keep you from getting stuck behind the cars' famously slow drivers. The characteristic swoop of the aerodynamic roofline is subdued on the Prius V and nearly absent on the Prius C. What hasn't disappeared is the hybrid powertrain technology that continues to be the core of every Prius. At this point, the technology seems less miraculous and more like a no-brainer: you save fuel by using an electric motor to assist the gasoline engine, which shuts off entirely at low speeds or when the car is at a standstill. This technology gives all Priuses their telltale driving characteristics: an engine that shuts off at stoplights and performs adequately if unremarkably around town, but groans at high r.p.m. as it struggles to accelerate. Partly because of the cars' continuously variable transmission, there is a momentary lag after you step on the accelerator before the wheels gain momentum.

Most hybrids cannot be plugged in. With the addition of the Plug-in Hybrid to the Prius lineup, Toyota can now also appeal to its die-hard green customers who want to drive on grid-supplied energy. The Prius Plug-In joins the Chevy Volt and Fisker Karma in this category, with the Ford C-Max Energi and a plug-in version of the Honda Accord to soon follow. With all Priuses, efficiency is the priority, not plush accommodations or a sporty character. The interior has the feel of a high-tech gizmo, though one more akin to an older PC than to the latest Mac. The real-world fuel economy is stellar with all four of the latest Priuses: from 40 to 70 miles per gallon depending on the model and how you drive. Prius fans might talk in highfalutin terms about global warming and the like, but the secret to the success of the most familiar Prius -- now called the Liftback -- is its high level of overall competence with 50 m.p.g. efficiency. The car is functional, offering more legroom and cargo space than even in the popular midsize Toyota Camry.

A few weeks ago, I traveled with my family of four to Big Sur from Berkeley for the weekend, a trip I'd be reluctant to take in the Liftback. There was plenty of room for our gear in the expanded cargo area, and our teenagers had room to stretch out in the back seat. Most important, they barely fought during the 300-mile trip. Sign me up. Compared with the Liftback, the V is five inches longer over all, and its cargo volume is nearly 13 cubic feet larger. Nearly every measurement -- hip, shoulder and head -- increased by at least a couple of inches. What's the trade off for the extra room? A dip in combined fuel economy from 51 city, 48 highway m.p.g. to 44 city, 40 highway. Both the Liftback and the V wagon have a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine and a 60-kilowatt electric motor, for total horsepower of 134. In the V, the same hybrid system needs to pull 216 more pounds, so performance can be dull. On the road to Big Sur, we moved at a leisurely pace in Eco mode, with minimal use of the air-conditioning, and easily managed 45 m.p.g. On the trip back, which was more uphill, the engine labored and the car barely reached its federal 40 m.p.g. highway estimate. The extra space and flexibility comes at a price: the base-level Liftback is $24,795 and the Prius V starts at $27,335. If the V is about highway travel, the downsized Prius C is all about the city, commuting and cuteness. The C shaves 19 inches off the Liftback and it's easy to park.

But adult passengers will suffer in the back seat, and the cheap ping of the closing doors -- a characteristic of all the Prius models -- felt even cheaper on the C. Buttons, dials and interfaces were plain. It's what you would expect for an entry-level car, this one offered at $19,745. Actually, I had the most fun in the Prius C , despite giving up 35 horsepower. (The C has a 1.5-liter engine, compared with 1.8 liters for the others.) My test car was the only one of the four Priuses I drove that had a sunroof. Something about the C's diminutive size, and its slightly less geeky Prius profile, beckoned me to dart through traffic.

Indeed, I employed a heavy right foot in an effort to prove the E.P.A. wrong with its estimate of 53 m.p.g. in the city and 46 on the highway. But I managed only to pull down my real-world combined average to a still-impressive 43 m.p.g. If I had used the C as most Prius drivers are likely to, 50 m.p.g. would be a breeze. Again, it comes down to why you need a car in the first place. The Prius C would best fit my transportation needs: to get efficiently from Point A to Point B, run errands mostly around town and make an occasional one-hour trip. The latest of the four Priuses -- the Plug-In Hybrid -- requires the most thought about whether it matches your driving pattern. Starting at $32,760, it's the most expensive -- about $7,000 more than the Liftback and nearly $13,000 more than the Prius C. (With all options, the Prius Plug-In Hybrid tops $40,000.) The Plug-In qualifies for a $2,500 federal tax credit and, in California, a $1,500 state rebate. For some Californians there is another benefit: the Plug-In, unlike other hybrids including Priuses, qualifies a solo driver for the coveted car-pool lanes of crowded freeways. The outward appearance of the Plug-In Hybrid is identical to the Liftback. The extra money essentially pays for a 4.4 kilowatt-hour lithium-ion pack -- the others have less advanced nickel-metal-hydride batteries -- that can be recharged with electricity from the power grid. Unlike the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid -- whose wheels are powered solely by electricity, with rare exceptions -- the pluggable Prius blends gas and electricity at various points of the drive cycle. For example, the gas engine usually comes on when the car starts up, to warm the squeaky-clean exhaust system.

Still, for the most part, the gas engine remains dormant for the first dozen miles or so. Thus the ride is very quiet, on par (during those miles) with many purely electric vehicles. But since you're paying more for those batteries, a Prius shopper needs to evaluate whether the expense is worth it. Ideally, your daily drive would match the 11-mile range of the battery pack and you would then park next to an electric outlet. You need not worry about special charging equipment. Given the size of the battery relative to a pure electric car, charging is easy and takes only three hours with a standard 110-volt outlet. (A 220-volt supply speeds up a full charge to 1.5 hours.) Here's the right pattern: charge up overnight; drive 11 miles; park and charge at work; drive 11 miles home; and charge again while you have dinner, watch TV or sleep. If you follow this pattern, your gasoline m.p.g. could stay in triple digits. In my first five days with the Plug-In -- all short trips of 10 to 15 miles, punctuated by a couple of hours on my 220-volt charger at home -- I maintained an average of 74 m.p.g. But a single 80-mile jaunt reduced my week's score to 55 m.p.g. -- not a lot higher than I'd have experienced in the much cheaper Prius C if I'd driven it with a light foot. For a green-minded driver, choosing among the four Prii -- all stylistically similar, all quite efficient -- is a pleasant exercise. A dozen years ago, Toyota took an early lead on hybrids and it has never looked back. While competitors try to leap forward with new whiz-bang technology, Toyota is moving on to the next phase: adapting the technology for the mass market. The strategy is working. Toyota expects to sell about one million Priuses worldwide this year, and in September, Prius became the best-selling line of cars in California. Depending on where gas prices go, the rest of the country could follow.","With the addition of the Toyota Prius Plug-In Hybrid, there is now an entire line of Priuses designed to be more attuned to middle-of-the-road Americans.

Science,Seeking a Culprit When Bumblebee Carcasses Pile Up,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/03/science/dead-bumblebees-linden-trees.html,"In June 2013, in a Target parking lot in Wilsonville, Ore., an estimated 50,000 bumblebees dropped dead. Shoppers reported bees falling from branches and crawling on the ground. Piles of carcasses scattered beneath dozens of linden trees marked the largest mass bee kill ever recorded. The Oregon Department of Agriculture later determined that a pesticide used against aphids had poisoned the bees. They banned its use on lindens. But still more reports surfaced of mass bumblebee deaths around Oregon. Explaining them wasn't as simple. ""It's not your classic story of, oh, the pesticides kill the bees,"" said Sujaya Rao, an entomologist who studied the bee deaths while at Oregon State University. ""Not every dead bee could be because of a pesticide,"" she added. ""There are strange phenomena in nature that lead to things like this.""

[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] For centuries, people have noticed similar mysterious incidents around the United States, Europe and Britain. In a study published last month in PLOS ONE, Dr. Rao and other researchers proposed an explanation: If it's too cold, and the bees are too weak, and the trees are enticing but don't produce enough nectar -- all that may tip bumblebees over the edge. ""Not all bee death is related to humans,"" said Claire Lande, a co-author of the study who also runs an apiary in Minnesota. ""Sometimes it just happens.""

To examine the other alleged death-by-linden cases in Oregon, Dr. Rao, now at the University of Minnesota, assembled a team of bee detectives who followed leads to various sites for observation and collection of actively foraging and dying bumblebees, and then drew connections between the cases. After many dead ends, a pattern emerged: Deaths seemed to occur on cooler mornings, late in the blooming season, when trees start running out of nectar. So what did it mean?

Bumblebees are warm-blooded. To fly and forage, their thoraxes -- where their wings and flight muscles are -- must reach a temperature of 86 degrees Fahrenheit. To generate that, they shiver. But the cooler it is outside, the more energy the bee needs to do it. In crawling bees near death, the team found compounds related to energy processing that were different from those in active and foraging bees, suggesting the dying bees didn't have enough energy. As the floral blooming season progresses, the linden tree runs out of nectar. Why, then, would the bees keep returning if they are able to detect nectar levels? Alkaloids, like caffeine, can boost how rewarding bees find linden nectar. The team found an alkaloid called trigonelline that they think may attract bees. They haven't tested the idea, but they speculate that trigonelline could boost bees' loyalty to linden even as nectar runs out. But when they visit on cool mornings without enough energy to heat up for a return flight to their nests, they fall to the ground, crawl around and die.

Science,Why Do Parrots Waste So Much Food?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/02/science/why-parrots-waste-food.html,"Polly wants a cracker. Polly gets chopped vegetables, because parrots need a diverse array of nutrients. Polly eats one bite and flings the rest onto the floor. This is a common occurrence in the homes of parrot-lovers across the world. No matter what sort of delicious, nutritious meal is prepared, ""half of it lands on the floor and stuck to the walls,"" said Kat Gupta, the caretaker of a bronze-winged pionus named Leia and a frequenter of online parrot message boards, where others swap stories of re-tossed salads and overturned bowls. Polly, Leia and their peers aren't necessarily being picky. They're just being parrots. According to a study last month in Scientific Reports, wild parrots across the world also waste food -- an unusual and confusing habit in the animal kingdom, where making the most of a meal is generally an important part of survival. The new study provides ""a comprehensive picture of parrots' food wasting behavior in their natural environment,"" said Anastasia Krasheninnikova, a biologist at the Max Planck Comparative Cognition Research Group in Spain, an independent commenter.

Like parrot parents, researchers have long noticed their wild study subjects flinging around fruits, flowers and seeds that might have made perfectly good eating. Sometimes they'll take a bite or two before discarding them. Other times, ""they just cut it and let it fall,"" said Esther Sebastian-Gonzalez, a postdoctoral biology researcher at Universidad Miguel Hernandez in Spain, and the lead author of the paper. A group of ornithologists tracked this behavior in the wild over several years. They also watched for it in more controlled settings. The result was data covering 103 species in 17 countries, encompassing 30 percent of known parrot types. Every single one wasted food, from the blue-and-yellow macaw of South America to the sulfur-crested cockatoo of Australia. In some instances, a single parrot was observed jettisoning 80 percent of food it picked. ""We knew that it was going to be widespread, but we were surprised it was that much,"" Dr. Sebastian-Gonzalez said. In some cases, ""it looked like they were playing with the food instead of eating it."" The data yielded patterns. Parrots are more likely to drop unripe fruits than ripe ones, and they're more careful with food during breeding season, when they are raising hungry chicks.

But other factors didn't matter so much: the size of the bird , the number of other birds around, whether or not there were parasites in the fruit. Even birds that hadn't eaten for a while greeted their next meal by junking parts of it. ""They do it in any situation, which is very curious,"" Dr. Sebastian-Gonzalez said. This profligacy might actually help other members of the birds' ecosystems. The researchers observed 86 types of animals, from ants to cattle-like zebus, eating food that parrots had dropped. A number of these secondary munchers might have then dispersed seeds, a boon to the plants as well. But this doesn't explain the biggest question -- what does it do for the parrots? In the past, observers have chalked the habit up to clumsiness. But that it happens with such regularity across species suggests that there could be ""an intention in it,"" Dr. Sebastian-Gonzalez said. Her best guess is that the parrots are planning ahead. ""For human production, you cut fruits to make the crop better,"" she said. ""So maybe the birds are doing something like that. They are pruning the trees to get sweeter fruits, and bigger fruits later."" Parrots are known to make forward-thinking decisions, so this wouldn't be a total surprise, but it's not clear yet how the behavior could have evolved, Dr. Kraheninnikova said. The researchers are hoping to test their hypothesis with more studies. In the meantime, people like Dr. Gupta are left to shoulder their brooms, and to try new foods and new strategies, likely in vain. ""Based on our study, I don't think you can do much,"" Dr. Sebastian-Gonzalez said.",The behavior is so consistent across species and in the wild that some scientists think it must be intentional.,b1971f24-d27c-57bb-b97b-2a3e6e81c44b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/05/science/02TB-PARROT1/02TB-PARROT1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=d10fbb7cee1049a6069cb20581a7e72693559588cf5b33537b1a30335dca7175&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A blue-and-yellow macaw that is definitely about to leave some morsels on the ground.,b1971f24-d27c-57bb-b97b-2a3e6e81c44b,N24News/imgs/b1971f24-d27c-57bb-b97b-2a3e6e81c44b.jpg,2
Movies,'Climax' Review: A Party That Assaults the Senses and Scrambles the Brain,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/movies/climax-review.html,"These are not, in themselves, all that interesting. Noe may be a better technician than a thinker. And like most parties that go on too long and spin out of control, this one gets boring after a while. But the director's skill and energy keep it exciting -- if not entirely pleasant -- at least until the serious violence starts.

[Gaspar Noe makes his peace with not being hated.]

The dancers, finished with rehearsals and about to embark on a tour of America, gather for music and drinks in a cavernous room on a winter night. We know it will end badly -- the first image we've seen is of a desperate, bleeding woman crawling through the snow in daylight -- and that the group came together in a spirit of eager creativity. On an old color television (the story takes place in the mid-90s), we watch snippets of the audition interviews that brought them to this fateful evening. The set is flanked by VHS tapes that offer clues about what is to come. The titles include ""Suspiria"" (the Dario Argento original, not the more recent remake), ""Querelle"" and ""Possession,"" films maudits whose ranks ""Climax"" aspires to join.

It has its moments, most of them in the first half, when the emphasis is on movement rather than mayhem. There are two extended group dance sequences, one filmed almost entirely from above, that are enthralling for their discovery of the strangeness and beauty of human bodies.

At rest, the people, a mix of races, sizes and sexualities, are somewhat more ordinary. They gossip, squabble and banter. The men brag about the sex they've had or want to have. The women do that, too, though in less explicit terms. The audience manages to figure out who is who, and struggles to remember the names, as if we had crashed the party. Selva (Sofia Boutella) is the one with the dyed-blond bob who might be the main character. David (Romain Guillermic) is the guy putting the moves on her. Daddy (Kiddy Smile) is the D.J. Emmanuelle (Claude Gajan Maull) is the mother of the little kid.

Sports,Qatar Cuts Through Tension and Defenders to Beat Saudi Arabia,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/sports/saudi-arabia-qatar-asian-cup.html,"ABU DHABI -- The message to the D.J. was short and to the point: no Arabic music. That was the edict from the organizers of the Asian Cup match here on Thursday, an attempt to limit even the opportunity for a flash point in the first soccer match between Saudi Arabia and Qatar since the start of a bitter political feud nearly two years ago. The dispute, and the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar, has so divided countries in the region that even the prematch music at the tournament is now viewed through that prism. At other matches at the Asian Cup, the most important soccer event on the sprawling continent, the soundtrack has included music from the participating countries. That was not the case Thursday at the Zayed Sports City Stadium, where the sound system blasted western dance music in an effort to avoid even the risk of inflaming tensions between rival supporters. In the case of Qatar, that support was limited to a Korean woman, a male student from China and band of Omanis who arrived during the second half after acquiring free tickets. Almost no Qatari fans have traveled to the tournament amid the blockade of the tiny emirate by a Saudi-led group of its neighbors, including the United Arab Emirates, that has made travel extremely difficult -- and entry into the U.A.E. close to impossible.

Coaches from both teams had tried to play down the political cloud that had hung over Thursday's game since the teams were drawn into the same first-round group months ago. After the game, they steered a similar course, brushing aside any questions related to matters out of their control, and instead focusing on the challenges awaiting them in the knockout rounds. Qatar, which won the group, will face Iraq; Saudi Arabia faces a more difficult game against Japan, a regional power. ""It has nothing to do with football so I won't give a response,"" Juan Antonio Pizzi, Saudi Arabia's Argentine coach said in response to a question about the off-field tension. Felix Sanchez, Qatar's Spanish coach, conceded only that hearing his team's national anthem roundly jeered by most of the fans was a ""difficult moment"" for his players, but he concluded the game was played in a positive spirit on the field. Controversy flared outside the lines, however. Local organizers were said to have reacted with fury after a commentator on the Qatar-owned network beIN Sports mentioned the blockade during the live broadcast of an earlier Iran-Iraq game. In response, the Saudi Sports Media Federation released a statement Thursday accusing beIN, which is broadcasting the tournament across the Middle East, of using its exclusive rights to push its political agenda.

The U.A.E. and Saudi Arabia have been in lock step in their opposition to Qatar, and that divide was visible in the stands. Behind the goal where Almoez Ali, the tournament's top scorer, delivered the first of his two goals for Qatar, three men stood for the entire match, holding aloft two flags, one a Saudi one and the other Emirati, fused together. Saudi efforts to boost crowd numbers included commandeering two desks at the entrance of the Bab al Qasr hotel, situated yards from the U.A.E.'s presidential palace. There, officials armed with fist-sized stacks of tickets, distributed them for free to fans -- whether Saudi or not -- with only one request: Support Saudi Arabia.

The efforts largely fell flat. The attendance was declared at just over 16,000, though the actual number of fans appeared far lower. Qatar had almost none: a Qatar soccer federation spokesman said as many as 2,000 fans would have made the trip in normal times. In the end, Qatar had to make do with a small and curious collection of followers that included Janko Yang, a 23-year-old Chinese student who grew fond of Qatar's soccer team after its under-23 squad visited his hometown, Changzhou, last year. At the other end of the stadium, Mary Lee, the Korean communications worker who has become relatively well-known around the team, had somehow snagged a seat in the media area. Sporting a silk dress she had made in the maroon and white colors of Qatar's flag -- a direct challenge to rules that forbid public support of Qatar in the U.A.E. -- Lee, 45, vowed to stay at the tournament until her adopted country completes its run. (Asked to change clothing by security officials before she attended the tournament opener between the U.A.E. and Bahrain, Lee has been given dispensation to wear her elaborate outfit only at Qatar's games.) The most voluble support, though, came from the group of Omanis who had raced across the city after watching their team clinch berth in the knockout rounds with a 3-1 victory over Turkmenistan. Beneficiaries of the free Saudi tickets, they cheered Qatar's players as they celebrated their victory. Oman has historically enjoyed a friendly relationship with all its neighbors, and has adopted a neutral role in the Gulf dispute. ""We are like one country, we are one people in the Gulf, and we are cheering for them because they haven't got fans here,"" said Abdullah Moqubuli, 30, before adding that he and his friends would have cheered for Saudi Arabia, too, had the Saudis managed to score a goal.","Qatar and Saudi Arabia, locked in a political dispute, collided on a soccer field on Thursday in the Asian Cup.

Food,Barbecue That Breaks the Rules,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/dining/pulled-pork-recipe.html,"There's no ketchup or cola in the sauce -- it's not even a sauce per se. But this take on pulled pork is just as full of flavor.

First, a disclaimer: This is not a recipe for real barbecue. There's no fire involved; you use a standard oven. The recipe should probably be called Slow-Cooked Pork a la Barbeque, and rightfully so. It does not conform to Texas, Kansas City or any other cherished American barbecue standards. There is no ketchup or cola in the sauce. There's not even sauce per se, and the meat simmers in liquid instead of basking in smoky dry heat. In this way, it's more like a soupy Mexican barbacoa of lamb or goat. The seasoning veers Caribbean, though, with plenty of sweet spices, like clove, cinnamon, coriander and allspice. Cayenne provides a moderate baseline heat, which can be amplified with as much Scotch bonnet or habanero chile heat as you wish. On all accounts, it is robustly flavorful.

After slathering the meat with a flavorful paste, you stick it in a Dutch oven (I used an old enamelware turkey roaster), add a little water and let it bubble slowly under the lid for a few of hours. There is nothing to do but wait.

As for the cut of pork, choose a bone-in (or boneless) marbled shoulder roast or thick-cut county-style ribs, which are meaty bone-in chops cut from the shoulder end of the loin. Shoulder meat becomes tender and succulent with long cooking, while leaner cuts, like loin or leg, are better roasted. Should pork not be in your diet, use beef short ribs, lamb shanks or chicken legs. I dare say you could concoct a mean vegetarian version with root vegetables and tofu, too.

You're going for ultratender, falling-off-the-bone, melt-in-your-mouth succulence. A word of caution, however: Even long-cooked meat can become overcooked, so take care. Take it too far, and moist chunks turn stringy and dry, which is not the end of the world, but still. There's a critical moment when it's just right, the point of perfection when meat is well and truly ready.

Cut into biggish chunks and served in its spicy juices with beans, rice and cornbread, the pork is sublime. It's also very good on a crusty bun, if you wait till the inside gets good and soggy. Of course, you can also shred the meat to make more traditional pulled pork sandwiches or excellent tacos. It will never qualify as authentic smokehouse barbecue, but that was never the aim. For selecting a wine with these meaty pork ribs, it's all about the sweet, hot and spicy flavorings. They call for a red of substance and body, ideally with freshness and acidity as well. My first thought is of grenache, which worldwide has undergone a stylistic transition from overripe and sweet to fresh and complex over the last few years. Where would you like to go? France for Chateauneuf-du-Pape or Gigondas? Spain for Priorat or Sierra de Gredos? California or Australia? Plenty of great ones are out there. You could try something more esoteric, like a bobal from Manchuela in Spain or a red from the Canary Islands. The Douro in Portugal and Languedoc in France are making winning wines. Beaujolais and pinot noir would work, too, as would a dry earthy Lambrusco. Choices abound. ERIC ASIMOV Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

Style,"Johnny Depp Is NOT Best Friends With This Lizard, Despite Report",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/style/gossip-cop-trump-stormy-daniels.html,"Gossip Cop exists to debunk celebrity rumors. It claims to surveil ""more than 200 websites, TV shows, newspapers and magazines"" for inaccuracies. Since 2009, the site's unmistakably urgent headlines -- ""Jennifer Aniston Did NOT 'Flee To Italy' Amid Brad Pitt Reunion Rumors, Despite Report""; ""George Clooney, Amal 'Divorce' Claim Is Late And Wrong""; ""Selena Gomez 'Shocked' Justin Bieber Married Hailey Baldwin Is Made-Up Story"" -- have been written to challenge even the most frivolous of tabloid stories. When Star reported, for example, that a New York City restaurant prevented the actor Emma Stone from consuming a homemade birthday cake on its premises, Gossip Cop located an unnamed ""pal"" to dispute the account. That editorial mission makes reading Gossip Cop a confusing experience. Plenty of people would be interested if Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston secretly reunited -- one of the many recurring rumors that Gossip Cop deflates -- but how much does the populace care about Radar's report on Jessica Simpson's monthly expenditure on Postmates deliveries? Or the veracity of Star's claim that Kanye West secretly wants to open a restaurant? For whom does it matter that these stories might be false? Gossip Cop relies heavily on celebrity publicists to knock down rumors about their famous clients, so it's tempting to dismiss the site as a public relations arm of the entertainment industry. But there is an emerging rigor to Gossip Cop's methodology, reflected in the latest iteration of the site and the actions of the website's founder, Michael E. Lewittes. On the surface, it appears that Gossip Cop has ambitions to become, or at least be treated like, a full-blown fact-checking service on par with PolitiFact and Snopes. This notion is disputed by Mr. Lewittes, a former Access Hollywood producer and tabloid columnist who launched the site with financial backing from Dan Abrams, a television journalist and founder of Abrams Media, the boutique online publisher of Mediaite and The Mary Sue. (Mr. Abrams is listed as co-owner and co-founder, but is not connected to the editorial content of the site; he currently serves as chief legal correspondent for ABC News.)

Mr. Lewittes and Mr. Abrams attended high school together in the Bronx. Both grew up in families laden with lawyers. Mr. Abrams is the son of the First Amendment attorney Floyd Abrams and the older brother of Ronnie Abrams, a federal judge in the Southern District of New York. Ronnie Abrams is married to Greg Andres, a former federal prosecutor who now works for the office of Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russia's efforts to interfere with the 2016 election. And Mr. Lewittes is the son of Joel Lewittes, a former federal judge, also in New York's Southern District, and his wife, Lee Kushnir Lewittes, is a booker for the Fox News morning show ""Fox & Friends."" (According to an online newsletter published earlier this year, the Lewittes family attends Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun, the Upper East Side synagogue that, until early 2017, counted Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump as members.) In 2009, Mr. Lewittes and Mr. Abrams framed the site as a corrective to an out-of-control tabloid press. Not only would it be a ""media watchdog,"" as Mr. Abrams put it, but a source of feel-good news about celebrities. Beside videos of paparazzi behaving badly were sections called ""Hollygood"" and ""Hollywood Heart,"" both devoted to documenting celebrity philanthropy. Mr. Lewittes, in particular, wanted to combat what he saw as a nihilistic streak in the Hollywood press. ""We live in a time when many feel being first or outrageous is more important than being factual, and I want to change that,"" he told Mr. Abrams's media news site, Mediaite. ""Not only are people filing false reports on their blogs every day, but so much of what is out there is just meanspirited for no reason at all.""

The site was also built as act of repentance. Mr. Lewittes describes himself not just as ""creator, owner, founder and 'Top Cop'"" of the site, but as ""a reformed gossip columnist who knows the industry inside and out,"" and who worked previously at Access Hollywood, Us Weekly, The New York Daily News and The New York Post. He also did a stint at Star itself. The Gossip Cop masthead now lists only one other full time editor. Early on, the site drew skepticism for its methodology. Shortly after Gossip Cop's debut, an editor at New York magazine wrote: ""Publicist denials are not only boring, they're meaningless. These are people who are paid to lie to protect their clients."" In 2012, the Columbia Journalism Review questioned the wisdom of Gossip Cop using anonymous sources to challenge rumors by other anonymous sources. Or, as Craig Silverman, the founder of Regret the Error and expert on corrections in media, put it, ""How can we know that Gossip Cop's 'source' is better than In Touch's 'Insiders'?"" But for the past two years, Gossip Cop has participated in events held by the Poynter Institute's International Fact-Checking Network (I.F.C.N.), whose signatories are required to undergo an extensive audit and adhere to a detailed code of principles. The company has updated its about page to reflect those principles. Mr. Lewittes has attended Global Fact, I.F.C.N.'s annual summit, for the past two years. Being a verified signatory of I.F.C.N. is not particularly valuable by itself. It is, however, a ""minimum condition"" for becoming a third-party fact checker on Facebook's News Feed, a position that carries with it incredible power. Facebook, through these verified parties, says it deeply limits the spread of stories deemed false, and removes accounts that are flagged for violating policies. The quantity of false stories, these fact checkers said, is vast. Early on in this relationship with Facebook, fact-checking entities noted that there is no way for them to keep up with the high quantity of false or misleading information that circulates on Facebook. There can also be questions, apparently, of just how factual a fact is. In September, The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine and Facebook-certified fact checker, rated as false an online essay about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's position on Roe v. Wade, possibly squelching that essay's Facebook readership. The nature of the fact-check, which hinged on the literal and colloquial meanings of the word ""said,"" and the liberal politics of ThinkProgress, where the disputed essay appeared, unleashed a furious debate about Facebook's role in refereeing, and suppressing, political commentary.

Gossip Cop would not discuss its future with I.F.C.N., whose signatories undergo a stringent review, or with Facebook, which has certified just five fact-checking outlets in the entire United States, including Snopes and Associated Press. Certainly the subject matter practice is different for a website that recently debunked rumors that Johnny Depp damaged his brain in a too-hot sauna, that Courteney Cox is obsessed with tarot cards and that Norman Reedus of ""The Walking Dead"" has a bad attitude on set (""Gossip Cop can debunk the baseless claim. It's simply not true.""). While giving verified independent outlets special license to fact-check may help embattled platforms like Facebook and Google help to restore their image in the short-term, in the long-term, as the Weekly Standard episode suggests, the same arrangement has the potential to do more damage. In January 2016, Gossip Cop began deleting thousands of old posts in what seems to have been an effort to organize and clean up its archives. One of the removed articles, published in October 2011, concerns the now-familiar allegation that Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels had an affair. The rumor had appeared on The Dirty, an Arizona-based gossip website, and was later picked up by the celebrity magazine Life & Style, which ran a 2-page spread under the headline, ""Did Donald CHEAT?"" (The question was not actually answered.) Two days later, Gossip Cop published a piece citing denials from both parties. An unnamed representative for Mr. Trump, identified hours later as Michael D. Cohen, described the rumor as ""totally untrue and ridiculous."" An unnamed attorney for Ms. Daniels, identified years later as Keith M. Davidson, accused The Dirty of concocting a fake scandal ""to lure potential customers to [their] commercial filth.'"" Gossip Cop's verdict: ""The story is 100% false."" ""The only people 'cheated' here are the tabloid's readers,"" the story said. Gossip Cop's treatment of this particular story presents a broader journalistic quandary. Confronted with the question of whether Mr. Trump and Ms. Daniels had a secret affair, the site did what most outlets would do: Ask both parties for comment and publish their responses. But lawyers and publicists are not always forthcoming about their own clients. Nor are the clients themselves. Indeed, around the same time Ms. Daniels denied the affair to Gossip Cop, she told other outlets, including The Dirty and In Touch, the exact opposite. In the seven years since the rumor of this affair surfaced, journalists have gathered evidence of its likelihood. Federal investigators have indicted Mr. Trump's former attorney, Mr. Cohen, over payments to Ms. Daniels and another woman, Karen McDougal, saying they violated federal campaign finance laws. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whose investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election spawned the inquiry into Mr. Cohen's payments, has not turned in a final report but House Democrats, who take control of the lower chamber in January, plan to investigate the president's role in paying Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal for their silence. Ms. Daniels' defamation lawsuit against Mr. Trump, which could unearth even more detail, awaits judgment before the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. (Representatives for Mr. Cohen and Mr. Davidson did not return requests for comment. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders referred questions to Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow, both of whom advise President Trump. Neither responded.)

And in the years since Gossip Cop first debunked the Trump-Daniels affair, it has beefed up its daily editorial process. Several years ago, an item about, say, Jennifer Aniston allegedly boycotting the country of Japan, required a short blog post at most. Now, Gossip Cop regularly publishes lengthy and nuanced analyses of why exactly a rumor is unlikely, citing factors such as the lack of photographic evidence or eyewitness testimony, the publication's track record, and the rumor's overall plausibility. In early April, the website began appending a list of sources to every article, including the names of elusive Hollywood publicists. Gossip Cop will revisit some stories a year after publication and gauge whether or not they turned out to be true. The site acknowledges that celebrities and their handlers have a capacity to lie: ""In an effort not to be 'spun,' we have, for lack of a better phrase, a 'social contract' with the stars, the reps and anyone else with whom we work,"" the site explains. ""If you lie to Gossip Cop, we won't work with you again."" Around the world, the spheres of politics and entertainment continue to overlap. The need for fact-checking outlets with an understanding of tabloid and celebrity culture, which is now political culture, is only likely to grow. Facebook, as is its way, wouldn't go into detail about its process for certifying third-party fact checkers. Controversially, the company enforces nondisclosure agreements with fact-checking partners, leaving the facts about fact-checking in a state of shadow. And Gossip Cop, for its part, would not speak of its plans for the future of fact-checking. But there is a world in which Gossip Cop could help determine what celebrity gossip gets to even exist on the internet. The Trump-Daniels affair is an uncomfortable reminder that in 2018, celebrity gossip can regularly be the real news. Almost every outlet that has covered the scandal has quoted or mentioned the story in The Dirty to establish the fact that the rumor predated Mr. Trump's presidential campaign. Seven long years ago, Gossip Cop deemed the underlying rumor as false. Maybe more disturbingly, it also was one of only two outlets that bothered to check it out at all.",A website called Gossip Cop fact-checks gossip.

Fashion & Style,Doom Is So Last Season,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/fashion/rick-owens-balmain-paris-fashion-week.html,"Rick Owens may be the only designer who could get his front row -- not to mention Courtney Love and Fergie -- to wear garbage bags. Or, O.K.: ponchos that looked like garbage bags. But there they were, neatly folded on every seat around the fountains in the back of the Palais de Tokyo. And there were the guests, putting them on atop their carefully choreographed outfits of the day, then eyeing one another to make sure they weren't the only ones looking silly. And then realizing, hell yeah, they all were doofuses together, and beginning to laugh.

""I've been doing a lot of complaining and definitely romanticized doom in my work,"" Mr. Owens said backstage after the show. ""And I just thought, 'Enough of that.' "" It was time to, he added, ""celebrate beauty, and hope."" In Mr. Owens's hands this does not mean, of course, exactly what it might mean for most other people.

It meant cirrocumulus constructions wrapped and folded and cowled and bunched around the body. It meant rich forest green and bags sprouting over the stomach (Mr. Owens called them ""fertility bags.""). It had to do with stoicism, and then hiking nuns (but the wimples didn't work), and looked kind of Grecian and sci-fi at the same time. And it all somehow ended up with alien mother egg sacks: cotton stretched thin to form an undulating weblike chrysalis around the body, with various protrusions and lumps poking through (including the head) as if just on the verge of hatching. ""Because that is hope,"" Mr. Owens said. And no: No one is expected to wear it. But marvel at its peculiar grace, and grin at the idea? Yes.

Happiness is starting to be something of a theme this Paris Fashion Week. After a compellingly melodic Loewe show of long-line traveling clothes in patchworks of washed linen, cotton and jersey, many of them grounded by suede sneakers with toes curling upward like a genie's sandals, the designer Jonathan Anderson shrugged. ""They just made me smile,"" he said of the shoes. So did the clothes, an assured dance of volumes and mood, bohemia and urbanity, that included the best T-shirt dress of the week: in stretch cotton, different pastel gingham appliques pieced together on the front to look like a tank dress. Also, hobo tapestries mixed up with navy tailoring; bias scarf dresses flashing a circle of hip at the side, right where a bag might hang (the bags themselves, by the way, crafty and cool, were very good), and an army-prairie palette. Fashion is an industry subject to its own laws of physics, and every action has an equal and opposite reaction. This explains hemlines, if anyone is wondering.

At Ann Demeulemeester, that erstwhile haven of soulful poetics, there was a reason Sebastien Meunier booked the band Warhaus to provide a live accompaniment to his silken layers of black and cream, ostrich feathers wafting at the neck, suits stenciled with the words ""kids forever."" You can sit in the dark and philosophize or you can dance it out under the klieg lights. That's the choice as fashion sees it. The majority is coming down on the boogie side.

As the soundtrack said at Paco Rabanne, ""Disco to the disco."" Then Julien Dossena sent out a parade of suggestions on girls going as fast as they could to get there: paisley-print chain mail slithering to the top of the thigh or poured over a catsuit; body-conscious jersey tunics shirred up one side over skinny jersey trousers flared over the ankle; and silver slips shimmying yards of fringe. They were convincing.

A lot, apparently. In a letter to his younger self, handed to attendees, Mr. Rousteing noted he was having his show at the Opera because it was there, in all its gilt and gilded glory, that he first began to dream his fashion dream. He had ""come full circle,"" which, along with the unexpected (in a good way) graphic moment at the beginning, suggests that maybe he's reached the end of one stage and is about to embark on another. If so, perhaps he can leave behind the long dresses that harnessed the body, played peekaboo, and then exploded in a rosette of ruffles at the ankle so tightly that the models could not walk. There is nothing happy about a hobble skirt. Here's hoping this is the last we see of it. Now let's move this party on.",Hope is a good look at Rick Owens and Loewe; Balmain comes full circle.,97c8872d-994b-5efd-8b12-5ff8c25bcdda,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/30/fashion/30FASHREVIEW-INYT-web-owens1/30FASHREVIEW-INYT-web-owens1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=15e8c2bd0465698657c12b7b94990048e374874b3f145b6cb69779307a60e040&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Rick Owens, spring 2018.",97c8872d-994b-5efd-8b12-5ff8c25bcdda,N24News/imgs/97c8872d-994b-5efd-8b12-5ff8c25bcdda.jpg,19

Education,Board to Vote on Condoms in Boston Schools,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/education/board-to-vote-on-condoms-in-boston-schools.html,"BOSTON -- The Boston School Committee is set to vote Wednesday night on a new health policy that would make condoms available in the district's high schools, bringing this city in line with New York and Los Angeles.

It was more than 20 years ago that those cities, along with many others, made the controversial decision to distribute condoms in schools, in part to counteract the spread of H.I.V./AIDS. But since then, widespread distribution of condoms in schools has made halting progress -- a 2006 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that condoms were provided in just 5 percent of the nation's high schools, although that number may have risen since then.

Some schools have taken piecemeal approaches: in Chicago, condom availability is decided by a school's principal, while Philadelphia has added condom dispensers in some of its schools.

""Most would agree that the absolute number of schools offering such services has increased over the past 10 years or so,"" said Bill Albert, the chief program officer of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.",A new health policy that would make condoms available in the district's high schools is up for a vote on Wednesday night.,88c739ff-6982-5f1a-b6de-cbecc50e9434,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/19/us/CONDOMS/CONDOMS-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=7d336612ca092ce248ee02c3c5035066adf5b6423d77a0b07a5a57de15a2ff37&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"""It's shocking,"" said Genesis Bautista, 18, of students, ""how much they don't know.""

Television,Momona Tamada's Week: 'Satisfying' Baking Videos and Peace Through Podcasts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/arts/television/momona-tamada-favorites.html,"Like many of us, Momona Tamada, 14, has been trying to make the best of a tough year. Sure, the effervescent actress and dancer, who stars as the young trendsetting artist Claudia Kishi on Netflix's summer hit ""The Baby-Sitters Club,"" has been shining by most measures -- but pandemic life requires adaptation. ""Personally, I'm not a big fan of online learning,"" the actress said, in a phone call in late November. In addition to school, she has been auditioning remotely, and taking vocal lessons and dance classes over Zoom. ""The screens, they're inverted, so everyone is going in different directions, and it's a bit confusing,"" she said of ballet. But in some ways, between the demands of school and her career, she had a head start on our new reality. ""I had to switch to online last year even before everything kind of went crazy,"" she said from her home in Vancouver, British Columbia, where she'd been hunkered down with her parents, her younger brother, Hiro, and her puppy, a black Shiba Inu named Miso who is ""always doing something funny."" Being online early has had its perks. ""It definitely helped me find my own pace,"" Tamada said. ""I'm glad that I had a year to kind of get used to it,"" she went on. ""It's a struggle to balance schoolwork and working a lot.""

She played a young Lara Jean in the popular Netflix rom-com ""To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You"" (2020). And ""The Baby-Sitters Club"" -- a full-hearted, charming and progressive adaptation of the wildly popular Ann Martin book series of the same name -- was renewed in October for a second season. As for when they'd start filming again, Tamada wasn't sure. ""I hope the virus doesn't get worse,"" she said. ""I miss being on set and I miss all my friends."" There was a glimmer of normalcy, though, the day we talked. ""Today is actually the first day I get to go back to dance,"" she said with the crackling excitement of someone finally getting to leave her neighborhood. The actress also told me about her recent routines and the cultural items that have been inspiring her in these weird times. These are edited excerpts from our conversation. I woke up and took a shower while listening to the first chapter of the book, ""Life as We Knew It,"" for school. But I have a main book that I'm reading: ""Crazy Rich Asians."" I love the movie. So I wanted to read the book. And I took my pup on a quick walk. She is still new to this, but enjoying the fresh air. We got her in October, and we're getting her used to kind of socializing with other dogs and other people. She's the sweetest puppy ever, but she is also very smart, actually, and she has a lot of energy. So once she starts running, she can't focus and, yeah, she kind of goes crazy [laughs]. Then I made a TikTok -- kind of like my trailer in 30 seconds. I was just piecing together a bunch of funny videos that I found. Personally, I love watching fashion videos and fashion-inspiration videos. Also, one of my hobbies is baking, and I just love the short little tutorials. It's so satisfying how cakes are being made, like how they pipe everything out. I think that's what's so cool about TikTok is that you probably never see the same thing twice. It inspires me to maybe make what I saw.

I took an online ballet class. I've been dancing since I was 4 -- jazz and tap are probably my two favorites. But I pretty much do everything. While updating my journal, I listened to an episode of a podcast called ""Daily Breath"" with Deepak Chopra. That was my first time listening to it, but I love it so far. It's like five to seven minutes, and it brings such a good start to your day. Or I listen to it before I go to sleep and it really calms me down, because sometimes I get very anxious. It's a lot about self-love. Almost like meditation. The things that he talks about really resonate with my life. It helps ground me and center me. Before I went to sleep, I studied a script for my audition [the next day]. It's a long script. I'm happy with how it turned out. I woke up and listened to another episode of ""Daily Breath"" and to some music on shuffle. Some of the songs that popped up included ""POV,"" by Ariana Grande, ""Lovesick Girls"" by Blackpink, ""Falling"" by Harry Styles and ""American Boy"" by Estelle. I listen to a variety of music, whatever makes me happy.

I took some pictures of my pup in Vancouver because it was so nice out and then watched YouTube videos while eating lunch: Michelle Khare's ""I Tried Lifeguard Academy"" video. Michelle does all these -- she did like training to be a pop singer and training to be an F.B.I. agent. I think that's so interesting. I can see a little bit into other people's careers and the challenges they have to face to get to where they are. That night, Mom asked me to make pizza dough for our dinner. Yes! I love making dough. Something fun to do with my family. My pizza was so tasty. I'm a bigger baker than a cook, but I totally just try cooking new recipes all of the time. I just go off the fly and think about like, ""Oh, maybe this is good together."" And usually it's pretty good. I love watching Tasty, that YouTube channel. Then I had an online ballet class after dinner. We played a terminology game in the last few minutes. My teacher had a bunch of, I guess, French terms -- a word or, like, a move. And we have to define what that means in English. And then she'd mentioned a character from a ballet. For example, she said, ""Clara,"" and we'd say, ""Oh, she's in 'The Nutcracker.'"" Before bedtime, I played ""Among Us"" with friends. It's been trending for the past few months, and it's just so fun. It's anonymous, and you can't add people on it, so you're always in a game with new people. (But you can play with your friends by giving them the code.) There's one person that's the impostor, and they go around, like, killing people. It's not as violent as it sounds, I promise. But you have to figure out who the impostor is. And I've played Minecraft since I was like 9. The cast of ""The Baby-Sitters Club,"" we used to play all the time on set. It's a collaborative thing. And you get to really just create whatever you were imagining.","The young actress, who stars in ""The Baby-Sitters Club"" on Netflix, had a head start on our new, socially distant reality.",6e3745b5-1fa8-5cd0-a596-a70ce05edd3a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/06/arts/06recently-viewed1/06recently-viewed1-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Momona Tamada, a star of ""The Baby-Sitters Club"" on Netflix, had already switched to remote learning as she balanced her career.

Media,Arbitrator Scolds Fox and Orders It to Pay $178 Million to 'Bones' Team,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/business/media/bones-fox-arbitration-award.html,"A private arbitrator ruled this month that Fox must pay the extraordinary sum of $178.7 million to former producers and stars of the procedural crime television series ""Bones"" in a dispute over profit participation. The award spotlights a longstanding gripe among even well-compensated Hollywood players over the value of their work, especially as deep-pocketed newcomers like Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and Apple come courting. Studios have often been criticized for what some consider questionable accounting practices that cut into back-end payouts. The ruling spilled into public view on Wednesday after the plaintiffs in the case filed a petition to confirm the arbitration award in Los Angeles Superior Court. The arbitrator, Peter D. Lichtman, said that Fox pocketed tens of millions of dollars that should have gone to the ""Bones"" team. He ordered Fox to pay the plaintiffs $50 million in damages and an additional $128 million in punitive damages. Fox is contesting the $128 million ruling.

In his 66-page ruling, the arbitrator accused several Fox senior executives -- including the 21st Century Fox president Peter Rice and the Fox Television Group co-chief executive Dana Walden -- of perjuring themselves. Mr. Lichtman said that those executives ""appear to have given false testimony in an attempt to conceal their wrongful acts"" and accused them of a ""pattern of deceit."" ""The arbitrator is convinced that perjury was committed by the Fox witnesses,"" Mr. Lichtman wrote. Arbitration hearings are meant to be private and rarely come to light. Fox executives, however, were stunned by the ruling, which they saw as heavily one-sided, according to two people with direct knowledge of their thinking. The opinion left the company little leverage to negotiate a settlement, and the executives decided to contest the damages, the people said. That would also require public scrutiny before a judge. In a statement, 21st Century Fox said, ""The ruling by this private arbitrator is categorically wrong on the merits and exceeded his arbitration powers. Fox will not allow this flagrant injustice, riddled with errors and gratuitous character attacks, to stand and will vigorously challenge the ruling in a court of law."" ""Bones,"" an hourlong crime show, was a sturdy hit for Fox from 2005 to 2017. It starred Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz, both of whom were plaintiffs in the case, along with the executive producer Barry Josephson and the writer Kathy Reichs, who wrote the novels the series was based on. An arbitration hearing requires both sides to agree to the terms of possible damages beforehand. The plaintiffs and defendants also agree in advance to abide by the ruling, without the recourse of an appeal, as in a court trial. But a party can contest an arbitration judgment if it determines that an arbitrator has awarded damages that fall outside the agreed upon terms.

Complicating matters is that both Mr. Rice and Ms. Walden are weeks away from moving into senior leadership roles at the Walt Disney Company after it closes on its purchase of the bulk of 21st Century Fox's entertainment properties.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Fox has been under the leadership of its chairman, Rupert Murdoch, who built his media empire over more than six decades. Last year he agreed to sell the majority of his business to Disney for $71.3 billion. As part of the transaction, Mr. Rice is poised to become the chairman of Walt Disney Television and Ms. Walden will become the chairwoman of Disney Television Studios and ABC Entertainment. Hours after the ruling become public, Disney's chief executive, Robert A. Iger, defended his incoming senior executives. ""Peter Rice and Dana Walden are highly respected leaders in this industry, and we have complete confidence in their character and integrity,"" Mr. Iger said in a statement. ""Disney had no involvement in the arbitration, and we understand the decision is being challenged and will leave it to the courts to decide the matter."" At minimum, the producers and the stars of ""Bones"" will be awarded $50 million in damages, but it's unclear who will be on the hook for that payment. The plaintiffs sued Fox's television studio, which produced the show; the broadcast network, which aired the show; and 21st Century Fox, the studio and network's parent company. In the coming weeks, Fox's television studio will become part of Disney but the broadcast network will remain with Mr. Murdoch as part of a smaller company to be named Fox Corporation. Both Disney and Fox did not offer any explanation for who would be responsible for payment. The extraordinary award for damages has piqued the interest of the creative set in Hollywood. The entertainment industry has undergone a remarkable change with Netflix, Hulu, Facebook, Amazon and Apple cutting big checks for original content. Older fare has also become incredibly valuable. Netflix paid about $100 million to keep ""Friends"" for at least another year. The show, a decade-long hit for NBC, went off the air in 2004.

But as streaming services become more dominant, the economics of entertainment have become more opaque. Producers have struggled to understand how to value their work on a service like Netflix, which rarely offers data on viewership. Hulu, a joint venture whose owners include both Fox and Disney, is buying rights to shows from its own investors. The ""Bones"" arbitrator has suggested Fox was self-dealing when it sold the show's digital rights to Hulu, potentially depriving the plaintiffs of millions in extra fees. The case is scheduled to move from the shadows of arbitration to a Los Angeles courtroom in late April. The ""Bones"" team will seek to collect its money, while Fox is looking to vacate the $128 million ruling. ""We are so proud of the hard work we did on 'Bones' for 12 seasons and only ever wanted Fox to live up to its promises and contractual obligations,"" said Ms. Deschanel. ""I am grateful that such a well-respected arbitrator reviewed the facts so thoroughly before ruling the way he did. I look forward to the legal system continuing to hold Fox accountable so that we can all move forward.""","A surprise ruling accuses several Fox executives of a ""pattern of deceit"" in how they divvied up the profits for a crime show that lasted 12 seasons.",a573d752-3730-5cca-a360-eafec8d8bf7d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/28/business/28FOX-01/28FOX-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=01200c2ccb94c80e6802deb40801fa4f2881125d59fd659e918edfe1445b5ef8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""Bones"" ran for 12 seasons, starring Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz, both of whom were plaintiffs in the case.",a573d752-3730-5cca-a360-eafec8d8bf7d,N24News/imgs/a573d752-3730-5cca-a360-eafec8d8bf7d.jpg,16
Automobiles,A Family of Italian Twins That Took a Different Approach,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/automobiles/autoreviews/italian-twins-that-took-a-different-approach.html,"ASK a well-informed rider to name the venerable motorcycle maker whose gutsy air-cooled V-twins are a longstanding source of national pride and you might get this surprising, but correct, answer: Moto Guzzi. The pride is felt in Italy, of course, not America, and the company, which sold its first bikes in 1921, does not date back nearly as far as Harley-Davidson (1903). But like Harley, it has a rich history, and its current array of models seems to promise a competitive future for this niche brand. A winner on the racetrack from its earliest days, with a string of world championships and memorable machines, including outrageously complex V-8 grand prix bikes in the 1950s, Moto Guzzi has, like Ducati, MV Agusta and other Italian brands, a devoted following. More than 20,000 fans arrived in the brand's hometown, Mandello del Lario, for its 90th anniversary celebration last month. And like other Italian makes, it has changed hands a number of times, rarely a precursor of product integrity. Moto Guzzi's fortunes in the United States have had highs and lows, the company struggling at times as its bikes were overshadowed by the features and technology of Japan's makers. Worldwide, the company is projected to sell fewer than 6,000 motorcycles in 2011.

But nine decades after its founding, Moto Guzzi is part of Piaggio, the conglomerate that also makes Vespa scooters and Aprilia motorcycles. Though Guzzi is small, the Piaggio parentage has given it the ability to develop a diverse line of bikes in the touring, naked and custom cruiser categories -- and even a lithe sports entry. What ties the models together is a common architecture of 90-degree V-twin engines with a literal twist: the cylinders jut left and right, with the crankshaft in line with the bike's frame rather than across it. This makes it logical and simple to engineer a shaft-drive system, a brand hallmark that Guzzi's current models use. This engine layout solves other problems, too, making cooling somewhat simpler (a Harley-type V-twin, with cylinders placed fore and aft, typically runs hotter on the rear cylinder). But it also brings challenges, including a characteristic torque reaction, felt when the engine is revved, that wants to rotate the bike to the right. A rider soon acclimates, but a new owner would find it disconcerting. The latest of Moto Guzzi's big twins use a four-valve-per-cylinder design that the company has been spreading to a wider selection of models. For instance, the Norge GT 8V, a large-scale touring machine with a deep sporting streak, now carries the Quattrovalvole engine in 102-horsepower form. The Norge feels lighter than its 567 pounds, agile in traffic and easy to manage in stop-and-go situations. The thrill of riding it is in shooting through the gears with the engine pegged around 5,000 r.p.m. (At a stoplight, though, figuring out which gear the transmission is in can be tricky; finding neutral is easy, but the indicator light doesn't always come on.)

The seat is very comfortable, meaning you could easily cruise for hours. It feels quite capable, though it doesn't have the set-it-and-forget-it feel of stately ocean liners like the Honda Gold Wing or BMW's touring flagships. The gauges and user interface are, like the air-cooled engine, a bit of a throwback. There's no temperature gauge and no gear indicator, which seems odd for a $16,470 machine. The adjustable windscreen is nice, but the need to use two buttons to control it (one moves the screen up, the other moves it back down) is annoying.

Guzzi's line also includes the naked Breva 1100, the adventure-class Stelvio and laid-back motorcycles aptly carrying the California name. But perhaps its boldest statement comes in the form of the Griso SE, a fascinating mix of retro styling touches, cruiser proportions and sporting capabilities. Powered by essentially the same 1,151 cc engine that's in the Norge (though tuned to 110 horsepower), the $14,970 Griso is a handsome brute, the satin green finish of its tank, side panels and fenders offset by a complementary brown seat. Wire-spoke wheels reinforce its retro demeanor (though mercifully, they carry tubeless tires). There are touches of the modern, too, in the single-shock rear suspension and inverted-fork front end. Radial-mount Brembo brake calipers and wave rotors deliver first-class stopping power. At slow speeds, the steering requires only the lightest touch of the wide handlebars, but the bike proves stable on the highway. A mellow rumble spills out of the slightly too modern over-and-under exhaust pipes.

The Griso's handsome presentation has its flaws. The upper frame tube outdoes Ducati for being an exposed, in-your-face structural member. Tucked below the right side cylinder is an oil cooler so out of place that onlookers might well mistake it for a lunchbox. And the kickstand is so far forward that it's easy to accidentally brush the shift lever into gear. The model in Moto Guzzi's current offerings that sport-minded riders ought to find most appealing is the $10,230 V7 Racer. This retro-styled bike, along with its siblings, the V7 Classic and the V7 Cafe, uses a 49-horsepower 744 cc engine with two valves per cylinder. The V7 Racer is a jewel, bristling with beautiful craftsmanship in its details. Like earlier Guzzi sportbikes -- the LeMans and Daytona, notably -- it is drenched with Italian style, continuing a worthy tradition even if it doesn't much advance it. Rich black paint is offset by a candy-finish red frame and anodized bits; the bike seems to have been art-directed as much as it was designed. The theme is cafe racer, and it is no halfhearted effort. There is a small headlight fairing and a classic one-up seat with racing-style number plates (easily removed in minutes). There are dual shocks at the rear, fully adjustable, so this seemingly dated layout doesn't really limit handling, and the conventional front fork has gaiters that seem right out of the '60s. The tapered tip of the mufflers (the exhaust system incorporates catalytic converters without any compromise to the appearance) is a perfect finishing touch. The V7's smaller engine is in perfect scale to the frame, and its decreased displacement also results in smoother running and a shortage of reserve power at highway speeds. It is sweet at 4,500-5,000 r.p.m., though a serious buzz sets in as the revs approach the 6,800 r.p.m. power peak. A hard look for shortcomings will reveal turn signals that are cheap-looking for a bike in this price class. But there's little else to detract from the enjoyment of this thoroughly delightful back-road companion.","Piaggio, the Vespa maker, bought the venerable motorcycle company Moto Guzzi in 2004.

Technology,The Next Tech Talent Shortage: Quantum Computing Researchers,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/technology/quantum-computing-jobs-immigration-visas.html,"Christopher Savoie, founder and chief executive of a start-up called Zapata, offered jobs this year to three scientists who specialize in an increasingly important technology called quantum computing. They accepted. Several months later, the Cambridge, Mass., company was still waiting for the State Department to approve visas for the specialists. All three are foreigners, born in Europe and Asia. Whether the delays were the result of tougher immigration policy or just red tape, Mr. Savoie's predicament was typical of a growing concern among American businesses and universities: Unless policies and priorities change, they will have trouble attracting the talent needed to build quantum technology, which could make today's computers look like toys. It is a story that is being told repeatedly in the tech industry in the United States. As companies push into new technologies, they are finding it harder to identify qualified engineers and researchers. They are also facing tougher immigration rules for foreign-born tech experts and competing with tech centers like Montreal, London, Paris and Beijing.

International competition is a particularly thorny issue in quantum computing because one of these machines -- in theory -- could crack the encryption that protects sensitive information inside governments and businesses around the world. If a quantum computer can be built, it will be exponentially more powerful than even today's supercomputers. Last month, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy invited experts from government, industry and academia to Washington for a daylong policy meeting dedicated to quantum technologies. Several attendees, including Mr. Savoie, expressed concern that the Trump administration's immigration policies could affect quantum research in academia and corporations. ""The concern is: Are we still the destination for the best and the brightest in science and engineering and technology?"" said Roger Falcone, a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, who attended the meeting in Washington.

The labor pool in quantum computing is even smaller. By some accounts, fewer than a thousand people in the world can claim to be doing leading research in the field. The number of international students applying to physics doctoral programs in the United States fell by an average of 12 percent this year, according to a study from the American Physical Society. Universities on the coasts have maintained their numbers, the study said, but the drop is noticeable in the middle of the country. For decades, quantum computing was purely experimental. When it was first proposed in the early 1980s, the goal was to build a system based on the seemingly magical principles of quantum mechanics. Over the past several years, scientists have shown that they can build these machines, if only on a small scale. With traditional computers, transistors store ""bits"" of information, and each bit is either a 1 or a 0. Those are the fundamental slices of data that tell a computer what to do. When some types of matter are extremely small or extremely cold, they behave differently. That difference allows a quantum bit, or qubit, to store a combination of 1 and 0. Two qubits can hold four values at once. As the number of qubits grows, a quantum computer becomes exponentially more powerful. Scientists who build these systems specialize in the physics of those very small or cold things, which is nothing like the physics we experience from day to day. ""There just aren't that many people who know how to do this,"" said Steven Girvin, a professor of physics at Yale University. ""These machines are quasi-hand-built by Ph.D.s in physics.""

Because these machines could eventually break today's encryption, some believe there are reasons to be careful as large numbers of foreigners move into the field and to find ways of building a larger pool of American-born talent that can handle sensitive breakthroughs. ""We need to be cognizant"" of the potential for academic and industrial espionage, said Paul Scharre, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank. ""The answer is not to shut down the flow of people from abroad, but to find ways of better protecting intellectual property."" As American tech giants like Google, IBM, Intel and Microsoft accelerate their quantum computing efforts, work is speeding up in China and Europe as well. The Chinese government is working on a $10 billion national lab for quantum research in Hefei, set to open in 2020, and the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is building a lab of its own. In 2016, the European Union invested 1 billion euros -- roughly $1.2 billion -- in quantum computing. Could those efforts race past progress in the United States and possibly threaten national security? ""If you are talking about a quantum computer in Russia or China or anywhere else, you are talking about a weaponized technology,"" said Arthur Herman, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a think tank in Washington. The good news is no one has been able to build a commercially viable quantum computer so far, so there is time to fix the talent problem. Lawmakers and government officials are exploring strategies to help ensure that the pool of available talent grows.

Jacob Taylor, a veteran quantum researcher who oversees quantum strategy at the Office of Science and Technology Policy, played down concerns that other countries could beat the United States to quantum computing. ""We have been the leader in this world for a long time,"" he said. In artificial intelligence research, many worry that too much talent is moving from academia into industry, lured by high salaries, bonuses and stock options. In the quantum field, policymakers like Dr. Taylor hope to address this problem by funding projects at university and government labs. Congress is considering a bill that would allocate $1.275 billion to quantum research from 2019 to 2023. The bill, the National Quantum Initiative Act, has passed the House and is awaiting a full vote in the Senate. ""I see the country at a crossroads with quantum information systems,"" said Brian DeMarco, a professor of physics at the University of Illinois who specializes in quantum computing and has worked with government organizations on the technology. ""I can see things not working out, where the balance is not good, and it derails our ability to compete.""","By some estimates, only 1,000 or so researchers can claim to understand the technology. Finding more could become a national security issue.",9c34873c-8b67-59d0-9490-37d952a7ab14,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/22/business/22quantumtalent1/22quantumtalent1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=a0fb311afd9001f1f945e3a587ab8a823af5e59cc80251c08299cdd93b836f7c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Christopher Savoie, founder and chief executive of the start-up Zapata, said he had offered jobs to three foreign scientists who specialize in quantum computing.

Science,A New Population of Blue Whales Was Discovered Hiding in the Indian Ocean,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/science/blue-whales-indian-ocean.html,"Researchers said that the blue whale song that crackled through the team's underwater recordings was unlike any they had heard.



Weighing up to 380,000 pounds and stretching some 100 feet long, the blue whale -- the largest creature to have ever lived on Earth -- might at first seem difficult for human eyes and ears to miss. But a previously unknown population of the leviathans has long been lurking in the Indian Ocean, leaving scientists none the wiser, new research suggests. The covert cadre of whales, described in a paper published last week in the journal Endangered Species Research, has its own signature anthem: a slow, bellowing ballad that's distinct from any other whale song ever described. It joins only a dozen or so other blue whale songs that have been documented, each the calling card of a unique population. ""It's like hearing different songs within a genre -- Stevie Ray Vaughan versus B. B. King,"" said Salvatore Cerchio, a marine mammal biologist at the African Aquatic Conservation Fund in Massachusetts and the study's lead author. ""It's all blues, but you know the different styles.""

The find is ""a great reminder that our oceans are still this very unexplored place,"" said Asha de Vos, a marine biologist who has studied blue whales in the Indian Ocean but was not involved in the new study. Dr. Cerchio and his colleagues first tuned into the whales' newfound song while in scientific pursuit of a pod of Omura's whales off the coast of Madagascar several years ago. After hearing the rumblings of blue whales via a recorder planted on the coastal shelf, the researchers decided to drop their instruments into deeper water in the hopes of eavesdropping further. ""If you put a hydrophone somewhere no one has put a hydrophone before, you're going to discover something,"" Dr. Cerchio said.

By 2018, the team had picked up on several more instances of the new whales' now-recognizable refrain. Partnerships with other researchers soon revealed that the distinctive calls had been detected at another recording outpost off the coast of Oman, in the Arabian Sea, where the sounds seem particularly prevalent. Another windfall came later that year when Dr. Cerchio learned that colleagues in Australia had heard the whales crooning the same song in the central Indian Ocean, near the Chagos Archipelago. Data amassed from the three sites, each separated from the others by hundreds or thousands of miles, painted a rough portrait of a pod of whales moseying about in the Indian Ocean's northwest and perhaps beyond. Using acoustic data to pin down a new population is, by nature, indirect, like dusting for fingerprints at the scene of a crime. But Alex Carbaugh-Rutland, who studies blue whales at Texas A&M University and was not involved in the study, said the results ""were very sound, no pun intended.""

The researchers ruled out the possibility that the songs could be attributed to other species of whales. And side-by-side comparisons of the new blue whale tune with others showed convincingly that the northwestern Indian Ocean variety was distinct, Mr. Carbaugh-Rutland said. ""I think it's really compelling evidence,"" he said, drawing a comparison to linguistic dialects. Genetic samples would help clinch the case, he added. But blue whales, which spend most of their time far from shore, are difficult to study. Whaling in the 19th and 20th centuries also culled hundreds of thousands from their ranks; an estimated 10,000 to 25,000 blue whales are thought to remain. Not much is known about blue whale songs, although most researchers think that they help males woo their mates, as is the case with closely-related species. That can make any modifications to a cetacean melody fairly high stakes, Dr. de Vos said: ""If two populations can't talk to each other, over time, they're going to grow apart.""

Eventually, populations with different takes on a tune might splinter into subspecies, with their own behaviors and quirks. There's not yet evidence to show that has happened with these blue whales, nor much information on what might have driven them apart from their southerly kin. But even if the whales in this new group don't yet formally occupy a new branch on the tree of life, they are worth getting to know. ""What things like this show us is that there are different populations, with different adaptations, with potentially different needs,"" Dr. de Vos said. To conserve the world's blue whales, she said, ""there's not one single protection measure that's going to work.""",The whales in the group seem to sing a unique song.,8b7d222b-e57d-59c2-a86d-df202baa6850,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/05/science/23TB-BLUEWHALES1/23TB-BLUEWHALES1-facebookJumbo.jpg,Researchers said that the blue whale song that crackled through the team&rsquo;s underwater recordings was unlike any they had heard.,8b7d222b-e57d-59c2-a86d-df202baa6850,N24News/imgs/8b7d222b-e57d-59c2-a86d-df202baa6850.jpg,2
Health,"Vaping Illnesses Are Linked to Vitamin E Acetate, C.D.C. Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/health/vaping-illness-cdc.html,"A form of vitamin E has been identified as a ""very strong culprit"" in lung injuries related to vaping THC, health officials reported on Friday, a major advance in a frightening outbreak that has killed 40 people and sickened 2,051. Many patients with the mysterious illness have wound up hospitalized in intensive care units, needing ventilators or even more desperate measures to help them breathe. Most are young, male adults or even teenagers. ""For the first time, we have detected a potential toxin of concern, vitamin E acetate, from biological samples from patients,"" with lung damage linked to vaping, Dr. Anne Schuchat , principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a news briefing. The new report, based on samples taken from the lungs of 29 patients, including two who died, she said, ""provided evidence of vitamin E acetate at the primary site of injury in the lungs.""

She added, ""These findings tell us what entered the lungs of some patients with these injuries."" The patients came from 10 states scattered around the country, so the findings are considered broadly applicable and unlikely to have resulted from a single vaping product or supplier. The results mesh with other research that found the vitamin compound in vaping products. But Dr. Schuchat left open the possibility that other chemicals or toxins from vaping fluids or devices could also be causing the severe respiratory ailments. The outbreak has revealed the existence of a vast, unregulated, shadowy marketplace of illicit or bootleg vaping products that are essentially a stew of unknown chemicals concocted, packed and sold by unknown manufacturers and sellers. Hundreds of state and federal health investigators have been deployed to find out what has caused such extensive damage to patients' lungs, which researchers have likened to the chemical burns suffered by soldiers attacked with mustard gas in World War I. Vitamin E acetate is sticky, like honey, and clings to lung tissue, the C.D.C. said. Researchers do not know exactly how it harms the lungs, but studies in animals are being considered to help explain that, Dr. Schuchat said.

It is commonly used as a vitamin supplement or an ingredient in skin lotions. Makers of illicit vaping fluids sometimes add it as a thickener or to dilute the THC, the high-inducing ingredient in marijuana, and increase their profits. But just because something is safe to swallow or rub on the skin does not mean it is safe to inhale. The digestive system has enzymes to break down what we ingest; the lungs do not. Samples of lung fluid from the 29 patients were also tested for plant oils, petroleum distillates like mineral oil and other potentially harmful substances. None were found, the C.D.C. said. The findings were published in Friday's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. ""C.D.C. scientists developed 12 targeted laboratory methods to identify specific substances of concern,"" Dr. Schuchat said. ""This kind of assay development takes time."" About 70 percent of the people with the lung ailments are male, 79 percent are younger than 35 and 86 percent say that they have vaped THC. Many of the products used by those who became ill were illicitly obtained, public health experts have said, by patients who bought them from friends or on the street. Vaping oils typically include other additives, solvents and flavor enhancers. Health investigators have said since nearly the beginning of the outbreak in mid-August that some ingredients, including vitamin E acetate, could be responsible for some of the lung illness cases. State health officials in New York had first identified vitamin E acetate from several samples of vaping products collected in August that were analyzed by the Wadsworth Center Lab.

Although most cases of the vaping illness have been linked to illicit THC, Dr. Schuchat said that did not mean other vaping products could be considered safe. She said there were anecdotal reports, not yet fully investigated, of patients who said they had bought THC from licensed dispensaries in states where marijuana is legal. Nicotine has not been exonerated, either. Some patients say they vaped only nicotine, and state health officials consider some of those reports reliable, Dr. Schuchat said. Hoping to identify risk factors for the vaping illness, health officials in Illinois conducted a survey of 4,631 adults 18 and older who vaped and were healthy, and compared them with those who got sick from vaping. Most of the healthy responders vaped nicotine, but 21 percent used THC. The patients who became ill were more likely to vape only THC, and to use it frequently, more than five times a day. They were nine times as likely to buy THC from informal sources like dealers, friends or on the street, and eight times as likely to have used Dank Vapes, which the officials described as ""a class of largely counterfeit THC-containing products,"" from unknown sources.

Additional fatal cases are being investigated, she added. The death count will probably go up. Because there is still uncertainty about what is causing the illness, the C.D.C. is continuing to urge people to avoid vaping anything, including e-cigarettes. Because of year-over-year spikes in the use of e-cigarettes among minors, the Food and Drug Administration is expected to soon announce measures that could involve banning most flavored e-cigarettes, including mint. Prohibiting menthol had been mentioned earlier, but the vaping and tobacco industries have intensively lobbied the White House and lawmakers against such a broad ban given that traditional menthol cigarettes remain on the market. On Thursday, Juul Labs, the nation's largest seller of e-cigarettes, took a step ahead of the anticipated flavor ban and announced that it would discontinue sales of mint-flavored pods, after the latest national surveys showed that teenagers cited fruit and mint as their favorites. But an aide to President Trump suggested earlier this week that vape shops might somehow be exempted from restrictions. And on Friday, he noted that the industry had created a lot of jobs. Mr. Trump said an announcement to protect young people would be made next week and would include a proposal to raise the age limit for sales of e-cigarettes to ""21 or so."" Federal law now sets a minimum age of 18 to buy both cigarettes and e-cigarettes, although about one-third of states have raised the age to 21. There is bipartisan support for such a move, which would require an act of Congress.","Samples of lung fluid from patients with the mysterious illness led to a breakthrough in finding a possible cause.

Travel,Hotel Review: White Hart Inn in the Berkshires,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/travel/hotel-review-white-hart-inn-in-the-berkshires.html,"The elegantly appointed 16-room hotel has had several incarnations dating back to the 1800s. Most recently, it was reopened on Labor Day 2014 by a group of owners including the writer Malcolm Gladwell, Annie Wayte (the chef behind the Nicole Farhi restaurants in Manhattan), the Redbook editor in chief Meredith Rollins, and her husband, Conley Rollins. The finished project is a stately colonial mansion in the heart of one of the most picturesque towns in the Berkshires. It has all the grandeur of an old manor house without any of the creepiness. The hotel is inviting and modern with impressive artwork and a stellar restaurant.

The White Hart Inn sits on the village green -- close to biking trails, the Appalachian Trail and an Olympic ski jump. And it's a short drive to more adventures: skiing, ice fishing and fly-fishing on the Housatonic River.

My husband, two small children and I stayed in a suite: The master bedroom had the kind of poufy, king-size bed that you expect to climb into with a ladder.

A visitor taking a picture of Tintoretto's ""Paradiso"" in the mail hall of the Palazzo Ducale in Venice. This year, the city is honoring 500 years since the painter's birth.

VENICE -- So you are a young college student, American, on your first whistle-stop tour of Europe. You have fought through the multitudes in front of the Mona Lisa and ""Las Meninas,"" tried to concentrate on the Sistine Chapel ceiling as the tour groups jostle you. But when you wash up here in the lagoon, and make your way to the Scuola Grande di San Rocco -- a 16th-century clubhouse for middle-class Venetians -- you step into something you'd forgotten: silence. Inside there are fewer than a dozen people, and all around you, in the half-light, are some of the boldest paintings of the Italian Renaissance, depicting the life of Christ with a directness you have never seen before. You gasp before the burly bodies that loom amid shearing bolts of white and divine blasts of amber. You walk out of San Rocco half an hour later, and the light outside seems too bright. Everything you thought you knew about painting is wrong. Some people's whole lives get upended when they first discover Tintoretto, the most Venetian of artists and the world champion of painterly turbulence. The Victorian art critic John Ruskin nearly fainted outside San Rocco. Henry James became ecstatic. Today, some visitors are reduced to tears. Tintoretto left me powerless, too, when I first visited San Rocco in my youth, and did so again for different reasons this October, just before record flooding turned St. Mark's Square into a swimming pool.

Tintoretto, born here 500 years ago, in 1518 or '19, remains less well known than his Venetian rivals Titian and Veronese, to say nothing of the slightly earlier Florentine painters so renowned they got Ninja Turtles named after them. One reason: Almost every major painting by Tintoretto remains here. Unlike the older Titian, he took few commissions outside the Most Serene Republic, preferring to decorate the lavish cathedrals and palazzi of his aquatic hometown, and to offer his services to humbler congregations from Cannaregio to Castello. His paintings are brash, giant, overwhelming -- but also fragile and, in most cases, immobile. Only Madrid's Museo del Prado, in 2007, has tried to present a real Tintoretto retrospective outside Italy.

Some visitors to Venice daydream in rocking gondolas; some sit in their favorite campiello and quaff spritzes all afternoon. I had no time for such romance. For four days, I buzzed through Venice's back streets and charged over its bridges like a mercenary, fueled by countless shots of espresso. I sweet-talked my way in broken Italian into one closed building, though I had no such luck at a padlocked church by the train station. At one cathedral, Santa Maria della Salute, I had to crash a wedding rehearsal, sneaking into the sacristy over a bed of rose petals. In all, I saw 150 or more paintings across 23 sites, from the overpowering San Rocco to little churches with a single Tintoretto, often dimly lit, visited only by the faithful. And I rediscovered how a city can shape an artist, and vice versa, though the price of the lesson was two severely blistered feet.

I STARTED my Tintoretto binge at the Accademia, whose show ""The Young Tintoretto"" was so mobbed on a Sunday that security alarms blared several times a minute as visitors nearly collided with the paintings. I nudged and squeezed to see Tintoretto's earliest portraits and religious scenes, hesitant, yet already exhibiting the sketchy, speedy brush strokes that would later so perplex his contemporaries. Also here were black chalk studies of contorted, muscular nudes, which Tintoretto drew after small model statues by Michelangelo. The young Tintoretto, so the legend goes, scrawled on his studio wall the instruction to paint ""with Michelangelo's line and Titian's color."" That double inspiration animates the huge painting ""The Miracle of the Slave,"" his breakthrough work, from 1548. Nearly 18 feet across, this epic tableau pictures the gleaming Saint Mark, patron saint of Venice, plunging headfirst from the sky to free a naked slave punished for worshiping him. A massive crowd of bystanders -- their bodies are brawny wads of orange, olive and blue -- cranes to see the disentangled victim, who lies knocked out on the ground.

In the tiny church of Santa Maria Mater Domini, abandoned but for one old woman playing with her iPhone in the pews, I was flabbergasted by a ""Finding of the True Cross"" with the same massive, colorful bodies as the Accademia's early masterpiece. Down at San Trovaso, a lovely church by the lagoon, I found a dynamic ""Temptation of St. Anthony,"" with bare-breasted she-devils repelled by a Christ flying through golden clouds. I resisted the call of the waterside bar at the chichi Bauer Hotel to check out the church of San Moise next door, where I spent a euro to illuminate a scene of Christ washing his disciples' feet; then I strutted past the Gucci and Ferragamo boutiques to find a second, better version in Santo Stefano. A few things become clear when you see this many Tintorettos in a short time. Unlike Titian, he doesn't really do landscape. Unlike Michelangelo, he paints architecture only in the most schematic ways. He isn't even much of a draftsman; his drawings are mostly unworked aids for larger compositions.

What Tintoretto cared about were bodies, muscly and in motion. The figures are often foreshortened and hover in abbreviated spaces. Their poses are orchestrated to the max -- everyone is flying, crashing, charging, recoiling. Their clothes, especially white fabrics, are translucent to the point of perviness. All of it is done with a speed and freedom that enthralled some of his contemporaries, and others dismissed as a scam to fulfill more commissions and make money. Maybe this is why some of us still don't get Tintoretto: He remains too ""furioso,"" to use his 16th-century nickname, for audiences who expect the Renaissance to be bright and ageless. On the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, in Palladio's exquisite basilica, I almost wished I had night-vision goggles to apprehend Tintoretto's vast, nocturnal ""Last Supper,"" whose spectral angels float above the apostles in ghoulish white outline. Even the hundreds of ascending souls in his wildly overstuffed ""Paradise,"" which he and his workshop painted for the largest room of the Palazzo Ducale, could easily flip and descend into hell. That, too, is Venice: seductively grand, but also sultry, hazy, a little bit debased. YET TINTORETTO BELIEVED. I went to see ""Paradise,"" whose ecstatic angels and prophets frame the doge's throne, after two visits to the excellent and rigorous exhibition that will be coming to Washington in March. The crowds were thinner at the Palazzo Ducale than at the Accademia, where I contemplated a newly conserved altarpiece from the humble church of San Silvestro: a twilit scene of the baptism of Christ, in which the drenched, half-nude son of God stands off center in a pool of light.

These two giant altarpieces, painted for almost no money, were Tintoretto's unsubtle applications for the biggest commission of all: the Scuola Grande di San Rocco , the last stop on my binge. Often compared to the Sistine Chapel, this is Tintoretto at his most ambitious and all-consuming -- the place where devotion, fame and Venetian spirit collide with overwhelming force. Its intensity starts right above the ticket desk, with an ""Annunciation"" of tremendous drama; Gabriel crashes through a ruined door to a shocked Mary, while dozens of cherubs divebomb into the room. Upstairs, in the dim main hall, are scenes from the New Testament suffused with passion, many of which celebrate Jesus's humility in ways that feel like a rebuke to the surroundings. In the blazing ""Resurrection,"" Jesus doesn't so much rise as erupt from his tomb, aided by buff angels with wings of lacerating white stripes. It's all too much to bear, but the biggest shock is Tintoretto's panoramic, heart-stopping ""Crucifixion."" Calvary appears as a shallow, warm-toned field, topped by a lightning-cracked sky. From the top of the painting, Christ looks down on the hard-working men who are executing him, and the writhing crowd of soldiers on horseback, but he does not appear to be suffering. It is the rarest thing in Tintoretto -- in this torrent of movement, an absolute stillness.

Nearly two centuries ago, in 1845, a young Ruskin stumbled out of San Rocco, his head full of those booming oranges and ectoplasmic whites, and lay down on a bench. The critic felt he'd been pummeled. That evening he wrote to his father: ""I never was so utterly crushed to the earth before any human intellect as I was to-day."" The paintings left him feeling like a whipped schoolboy, helpless, amateurish. ""He lashes out like a leviathan,"" sighed Ruskin after that first trip to San Rocco, ""and heaven and earth come together."" No increase in quantity is enough to recreate that first, awed rush of awe in front of Tintoretto's strapping yet weightless saints. He had thrashed me, too, after two dozen site visits -- though mine was no spiritual pummeling, just the fatigue of a wasted globe-trotter who'd negotiated the crowds along the canals far too fast. And yet my overdose had a paradoxical effect: It grounded my understanding of Europe's most extravagant painter, pulling him from the realm of eccentric genius and planting him back in his waterlogged home. What I hadn't appreciated was how much Tintoretto's dynamism drew from an experience of life in Venice you can still have in 2018: the shimmering of the canals, the winding back streets, the low-slung arcades, the continual sensation of being lost. Too much Tintoretto is not good for your head; it is certainly hard on your joints. But you have to bathe in this bustling city to find the source of light.","On the 500th anniversary of the painter's birth, our critic set himself a challenge: to see all of Tintoretto's major works, spread around Venice at 23 locations.",3a713de8-c0fd-50e0-9426-25456b70a4cf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/18/arts/18tintoretto-paradiso-promo/merlin_146539533_c698fdaa-0372-4eaf-b05d-25fcb2bc09b1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=90015fa62d09d9b934e8d67c3098985388c47968e3c3add1577a54872cec2172&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""Paradise,"" which Tintoretto  and his workshop painted for the largest room of the Palazzo Ducale.",3a713de8-c0fd-50e0-9426-25456b70a4cf,N24News/imgs/3a713de8-c0fd-50e0-9426-25456b70a4cf.jpg,14
Food,"Jim Meehan Has Left PDT, the Influential Bar He Helped Found",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/dining/drinks/jim-meehan-pdt-nyc.html,"The bartender Jim Meehan, a pioneering figure in the craft-cocktail revival, is no longer involved in PDT, the acclaimed East Village speakeasy that he helped found 12 years ago. He confirmed this week that he was forced out of his position as a managing partner, as part of an organizational restructuring in March .

""It's almost like a divorce,"" Mr. Meehan said Tuesday in an interview. ""This was not my decision, and I didn't want to be let go.""

Jeff Bell, the bar's general manager , who started there nine years ago as a barback, said he is in the process of buying the bar and Crif Dogs, the adjacent hot-dog joint on St. Marks Place, from Brian Shebairo, the current owner of the two businesses. When the state liquor license Mr. Bell applied for about seven months ago comes through, he said, he will take over and buy out Mr. Meehan.

Mr. Bell said the decision to part ways with Mr. Meehan ""came from the current ownership,"" meaning Mr. Shebairo.

Art & Design,Four Knockout Group Shows to See Now,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/arts/design/four-knockout-group-shows-to-see-now.html,"From left, Jonathan Lyndon Chase's ""Quiet Storm"" (2016); Jonathan Key's ""Man in the Violet Dreamscape (Diptych)"" (2018); Charlie Roberts's ""Sommer Dyr"" (2018); and Reginald Sylvester II's ""Kalief Browder"" (2016) in the exhibition ""Punch"" at Deitch Projects.





Among New York's many commercial galleries, there are group shows and then there are group shows, veritable extravaganzas that give the genre all they've got. These exhibitions are immersive and often densely packed; they can require of viewers the same stamina as museum shows (and often as much effort on the part of their organizers). They reach into the past or focus on other cultures. They show us the art of our era in new thematic arrangements, or the art of this-very-instant, from unfamiliar creators. Here are four of the city's most energizing and eye-opening group shows, with subjects stretching from fantastic art of the sixteenth century to contemporary assemblage from Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Each creates its own world, full of surprises and multiple rewards.

For one thing, when will another Chelsea art gallery present a combination of old and modern masters that includes Titian, Piero di Cosimo, Salvator Rosa (a naked witch), Jan Bruegel the Younger, Gustave Moreau, James Ensor, Odilon Redon, Max Ernst (three great canvases), and a follower of Hieronymus Bosch? The show has been selected to enhance unexpected connections by its organizers, David Leiber, a partner at Zwirner, and Nicholas Hall, a specialist and dealer, in European art. (Yes, some of the works are also for sale.) The curators were inspired by the Museum of Modern Art's voluminous 1936 exhibition, ""Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism,"" with which their effort shares nearly 20 artists -- but it has taken a much more focused view. No Dada, for one thing. What the early 20th century finally labeled ""Surrealism"" has come to include the uncanny, unfathomable and disturbing. The through line here, for the most part, is the human body and what the human imagination has made and continues to make of it. (Living artists include Lisa Yuskavage, Sherrie Levine and Robert Gober.) We see bodies -- ideal and not, and those of other species. Get ready for demons -- the temptation of St. Anthony is a recurring theme -- and violent historical fact: Kerry James Marshall's discretely bloody ""Portrait of Nat Turner With the Head of His Master"" (2011) vividly conveys the fury of the act and, more gripping, the perpetrator's consciousness of what he has wrought.

Nearly everything here is worthy of close study, so recommendations seem unfair. But please don't miss Paul Klee's gorgeously ominous ""Black Herald"" of 1924; a wonderful Klee-like painting of an abstracted garden made in 1949 by the young Antoni Tapies; and a little painting from around 1906 by Jose Gutierrez Solana, of masked street musicians that echoes back to Redon's spooky canvas, ""The Angel of Destiny,"" from around 1900. Also don't miss two small detailed paintings by unfamiliar artists: ""The Cause of Thunder,"" a green succulent landscape from 1965 by Richard Humphry, an American Surrealist born in 1942, and its neighbor, Filippo Napoletano's ""Dante and Virgil in the Underworld,"" from around 1620, in mostly dark red on slate, which merges Bosch and Piranesi.

The indisputable centerpiece is a copy of Bosch's ""The Garden of Earthly Delights,"" from around 1515. In this panoramic vista of humans, animals, birds, near-humans and strawberries, a gastronomical delicacy of the time, the pleasures depicted are often perverse, humiliating and painful, as befits the human condition. As ""earthly"" implies, Bosch seems to depict a world where God is absent and humans, subject to irrational forces within and without, are left to their own devices. On a recent Saturday, Mr. Hall drew a small crowd when examining the painting with a conservator. He said it is assumed to have been made with Bosch's permission, perhaps by someone working beside him as he painted his masterpiece. Proof: the drawing beneath the copy is schematic yet accurate, evidently derived from a tracing of the original.

Micro-macro extremes are the generating principle behind ""Intimate Infinite: Imagine a Journey,"" which centers on midcentury artworks that mesmerize through small size, countless repeating details, intimations of endless space (or all three). Unfolding across the gallery's three floors, it starts with blue-chip opulence: the ravishingly white-on-white canvases of Robert Ryman and Cy Twombly. The second floor is dominated by a conversation among four women who were contemporaries: Agnes Martin, Lee Bontecou, Eva Hesse and Hannah Wilke. The show darkens in mood on the third floor, where it most lives up to its title. Here you'll find figures and landscapes by Jean Dubuffet, rendered in the painter's strangest material, butterfly wings; Bruce Conner's ink drawings, teeming with details; and a starry night sky by Vija Celmins. Box sculptures by Joseph Cornell and Lucas Samaras share a big pedestal with works in combed sand and brilliant white plaster by Mona Hatoum and Maria Bartuszova.

Anyone interested in the future of art should see this invigorating show of works in two and three dimensions by 19 artists, one of whom is its organizer, the fast-rising star Nina Chanel Abney. Ms. Abney's own bright brash paintings, devised with stencils, never stint on either the political or the pictorial and much of the work in this SoHo gallery, by artists with whom she is close, follow suit. The future that the show envisions is diverse in demographics and the art is wildly representational, influenced by Neo-Expressionism, graffiti, cartoons and digital capabilities. Katherine Bernhardt, who has been sarcastically transforming such elements for two decades, is the show's eminence grise, represented by a new Day-Glo Pink Panther painting. But all artists have made their mark in one sphere or another, whether street art, the fashion world or the gallery scene, starting with Derrick Adams and Austin Lee, both experts of stylized figuration, and the ceramist Ruby Neri. Other enticements include the sexually charged paintings of Jonathan Lyndon Chase, Reginald Sylvester II's Picasso/Basquiat fusion; Charlie Roberts's ambitious carved wood and painted wood sculptures; Alexandra Bell's ""radical edits"" of New York Times articles she has annotated and retitled, and Cheyenne Julien's skillful graphite drawings -- poignant views of black life through a slightly cartoonized lens.","From eight centuries of the art now called Surrealist to startling new takes on assemblage from Port-au-Prince, our critic finds a heady mix of old and modern, sex and politics in these powerhouse gallery shows.",7984e583-375f-5aa4-b626-bc03a5bc422d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/22/arts/22Zwirner-punch1/22Zwirner-punch1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=d3e837b9dcb19663fd40e5b915f1ffb45c251ec69f6c0c378cdf27989536993c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Jonathan Lyndon Chase's &ldquo;Quiet Storm&rdquo; (2016); Jonathan Key's &ldquo;Man in the Violet Dreamscape (Diptych)&rdquo; (2018); Charlie Roberts's &ldquo;Sommer Dyr&rdquo; (2018); and Reginald Sylvester II's &ldquo;Kalief Browder&rdquo; (2016) in the exhibition &ldquo;Punch&rdquo; at Deitch Projects.",7984e583-375f-5aa4-b626-bc03a5bc422d,N24News/imgs/7984e583-375f-5aa4-b626-bc03a5bc422d.jpg,14
Food,Peruvian Tastes Find a Spot on the Upper East Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/dining/nyc-restaurant-listings.html,"Peruvian tastes have a new home on the Upper East Side. Jose Luis Chavez, a native of Peru who was raised in Venezuela, works out of an open kitchen in this stylish restaurant, which has an arresting wall sculpture of a black sea bass. Here, he gives a more formal presentation to many of the dishes served at his stalls in the Gansevoort and Canal Street Markets. Ceviches share the menu with grilled anticucho skewers of octopus or beef heart, larger plates of seafood or chicken over rice, and causas . Often served cold, causas combine mashed potatoes, which can be yellow, purple, orange or white , with ingredients like seafood, eggs and avocado . ""I want people to appreciate Peruvian food and ingredients, especially the causas,"" he said. There's a bar up front where pisco, the Peruvian grape spirit, figures in 10 of the 12 cocktails, including a pisco and tonic and a piscajita, a riff on the popular Mexican salt-rimmed drink. Miguel Yarrow and Brice Mastroluca are partners in this venture. (Opens Wednesday)

Joseph Dirand, the French architect, has created a special-occasion bar upstairs from its sibling, Le Jardinier, the vegetable-forward restaurant that opened last month. The Art Deco glamour of the bar and lounge , with mirrors, brass, lacquer and plush seating, make it a destination for cocktails. Shun is the second restaurant led by Alain Verzeroli, the chef and protege of Joel Robuchon, who was supposed to be in charge but died last year. At the bar, Mr. Verzeroli offers small bites like croquettes of brandade and endives with smoked salmon. There is a subdued dining room opposite, with a more Japanese aesthetic reflected in gleaming dark lacquer and tableware by Japanese craftsmen. There, Mr. Verzeroli, who describes Shun's French menu as ""more fine-dining"" than Le Jardinier's, frequently slips in Asian and Japanese ingredients. Asparagus with wasabi cream, lemongrass lobster, turbot with salted plum brown butter, walnut miso eggplant alongside lamb reflect his long tenure at Mr. Robuchon's Tokyo restaurant.

Wine buffs know the name Lalou Bize-Leroy, a Burgundian winemaker who has championed natural and biodynamic techniques and who was long associated with Domaine de la Romanee-Conti. At this wine bar, the partners Joe Campanale and Dave Foss emphasize natural wines on an intriguing list that also highlights lesser-known European grapes. Flatter the sardines with a glass of pigato, a white from Liguria. They're on the concise menu by Ashley Rath, the chef and a partner, of small and larger plates, like zucchini escabeche, cobia tartare, potato dumplings with greens, monkfish with rhubarb and lardo, and roast chicken for two. Desserts include Eton mess. Ilyssa Satter, another partner, is in charge of the creative side. The restaurant is done mostly in earth tones. (Thursday)

Technology,Microsoft Pledges $500 Million for Affordable Housing in Seattle Area,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/16/technology/microsoft-affordable-housing-seattle.html,"SEATTLE -- The Seattle area, home to both Microsoft and Amazon, is a potent symbol of the affordable housing crisis that has followed the explosive growth of tech hubs. Now Microsoft, arguing that the industry has an interest and responsibility to help people left behind in communities transformed by the boom, is putting up $500 million to help address the problem. Microsoft's money represents the most ambitious effort by a tech company to directly address the inequality that has spread in areas where the industry is concentrated, particularly on the West Coast. It will fund construction for homes affordable not only to the company's own non-tech workers, but also for teachers, firefighters and other middle- and low-income residents. Microsoft's move comes less than a year after Amazon successfully pushed to block a new tax in Seattle that would have made large businesses pay a per-employee tax to fund homeless services and the construction of affordable housing. The company said the tax created a disincentive to create jobs. Microsoft, which is based in nearby Redmond, Wash., and has few employees who work in the city, did not take a position on the tax. The debate about the rapid growth of the tech industry and the inequality that often follows has spilled across the country, particularly as Amazon, with billions of taxpayer subsidies, announced plans to build major campuses in Long Island City, Queens, and Arlington, Va., that would employ a total of at least 50,000 people. In New York, elected officials and residents have raised concerns that Amazon has not made commitments to support affordable housing.

Microsoft has been at the vanguard of warning about the potential negative effects of technology, like privacy or the unintended consequences of artificial intelligence. Executives hope the housing efforts will spur other companies to follow its lead. ""We believe everybody has a role to play, and everybody needs to play their role,"" said Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer. The company's strong finances, a sign of its resurgence under Satya Nadella as chief executive, have given it resources to deploy, Mr. Smith said. In October, the company reported net income of $8.8 billion in its most recent quarter, up 34 percent, and it had almost $136 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet. The company's stock has risen steadily under Mr. Nadella, and Microsoft is now valued at over $800 billion. A number of other tech businesses have tried to address the homeless crisis. Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has supported homeless service providers through his personal foundation, and the Salesforce chief executive, Marc Benioff, helped fund a proposition in San Francisco to tax businesses to pay for homeless services. Voters approved the tax in November, rejecting opposition from some tech leaders, including Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey. Others plan to build housing for their own employees. Such housing may help with demand, but it has also reinforced the impression that the companies are focused too closely on their own backyards.

""This is long-range thinking by a company that has been around for a long time, and plans to be around for a long time,"" said Margaret O'Mara, a professor at the University of Washington who studies the history of tech companies. Microsoft began researching the region's housing last summer, after the nasty tax fight in Seattle and around a peak of the housing market. The company analyzed data and hired a consultant to decide how to focus its work. The area's home prices have almost doubled in the past eight years, and Mr. Smith said he learned that ""the region has counterintuitively done less to build middle-income housing than low-income housing, especially in the suburbs.""

That squeeze hits a range of workers. ""Of course, we have lots of software engineers, but the reality is that a lot of people work for Microsoft. Cafeteria workers, shuttle drivers,"" Mr. Nadella said this week at a meeting with editors at the company's headquarters. ""It is a supply problem, a market failure."" Microsoft plans to lend $225 million at subsidized rates to preserve and build middle-income housing in six cities near its Redmond headquarters. It will put an additional $250 million into low-income housing across the region. Some of those loans may be made through the federal programs that provide tax breaks for low-income housing. The company plans to invest the money within three years, and expects most of it to go to Seattle's suburbs. The loans could go to private or nonprofit developers, or to governmental groups like the King County Housing Authority. As the loans are repaid, Mr. Smith said, Microsoft plans to lend the money out again to support additional projects.

The remaining $25 million will be grants to local organizations that work with the homeless, including legal aid for people fighting eviction. The Seattle Times reported Wednesday that if the $500 million were put into one project, it would create only about 1,000 units, so instead Microsoft will most likely put smaller amounts in many projects to help build ""tens of thousands of units."" The initial reaction to the company's announcement was positive. ""There is almost no level of housing that isn't direly needed,"" said Claudia Balducci, a member of the King County Council who helps lead the Regional Affordable Housing Task Force. A report in December by the task force said that the region needs 156,000 more affordable housing units, and will need 88,000 more units by 2040 to accommodate future growth. A growing body of research has tied the lack of affordable housing to increasing homelessness. A December study from the real estate website Zillow said that was particularly true when households pay more than a third of their income in rent. The New York, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle regions -- the country's largest tech hubs -- have all already crossed that threshold. ""The idea that you can live in your bubble and put your fingers in your ears just doesn't work anymore,"" said Steve Schwartz, head of public affairs at Tableau Software, which is based in Seattle. Amazon in recent years has worked closely with Mary's Place, a homeless shelter for women and children in Seattle, and is integrating a shelter for about 65 families into one of its new buildings. Amazon has paid tens of millions of dollars to the city's affordable housing trust fund as fees to build in the core of Seattle. Google supported the City of Mountain View's plan to add 10,000 housing units in an area it's developing, with 20 percent designated for lower-income residents. And Facebook has planned to build 1,500 apartments near its Menlo Park headquarters, with 15 percent to be affordable.","The move is the most ambitious effort yet by a tech company to fund construction for local teachers, firefighters and other middle- and low-income residents.",9dd569a4-f66a-585d-a824-2c2198533052,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/17/business/17microsoft-01/17microsoft-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=605bee8cfae323a333d91c3c43980935a4dd3780ef41fa724c0741ebfe4f6a2b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A government report in December found that the Seattle region needs 156,000 more affordable housing units, and will need 88,000 more by 2040 if the region's growth continues.",9dd569a4-f66a-585d-a824-2c2198533052,N24News/imgs/9dd569a4-f66a-585d-a824-2c2198533052.jpg,20
Food,6 Steps to the Best Barbecued Ribs,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/dining/bbq-ribs-recipe.html,"Ribs -- which take a few hours to cook and just 30 minutes of prep work -- are eminently worth the effort.





Let Texans brag about brisket and Carolinians extol pulled pork shoulder. For the rest of us, the ultimate emblem of barbecue -- and test of a grill master's mettle -- is ribs. Picture meaty slabs stung with spice, bronzed with smoke and slathered with sticky sweet barbecue sauce. The meat is tender, but not too tender, with a profound pork flavor enhanced by the pit master's art. You may have thought such alchemy possible only at the best barbecue joints. But great ribs are surprisingly easy to make at home, which is good news at a time when eating out can be fraught. Ribs are barbecue at its most primal and unadorned; indeed, that's the crux of their appeal. It's conceivable that you might eat brisket with a knife and fork, or more likely between two slices of white bread. Pork shoulder comes either shredded or chopped, and you always eat it on a bun.

Ribs, on the other hand, demand to be devoured caveman-style, ripped apart with bare hands and gnawed right off the bone. I won't say that cooking them is quick -- if you want speed, grill a steak. But if ribs take two to three hours in all, the actual prep can be done in 30 minutes. True, the process as I've laid it out here requires a homemade spice rub and barbecue sauce, and turning your grill into a smoker. But the results are achievable by all, and eminently worth the effort. Just follow these six steps, and the recipe I've provided. No special equipment is needed beyond the grill you probably already have in your backyard.

One of the secrets of great ribs -- indeed, great barbecue in general -- is a process that creates layers of flavors. I start with a slather, like Dijon mustard, that I brush on both sides of each rack of ribs. Next, I apply a rub -- in the recipe here, a fragrant amalgam of chile powder, brown sugar, salt and pepper, with celery seed added for spice. The third layer comes from apple cider, which you spritz on halfway through cooking. (This also helps keep the ribs moist.) The fourth layer -- the varnish, as it were -- takes the form of a chipotle bourbon barbecue sauce, which you sear into the meat over a hot fire, creating a glossy finish. The crowning touch is a light, fresh sprinkle of rub added right before serving the ribs to bring attention back to the spice.

Most professional pit masters cook ribs low and slow in a smoker. You're going to use a hotter and faster method called indirect grilling. In short, you cook the ribs next to, not directly over, the fire, with the grill lid closed and hardwood added to produce wood smoke. To set up a charcoal grill for indirect grilling, light the coals, then pour or rake them into two mounds at opposite sides of the grill. Place a foil pan in the center to catch the dripping rib fat. The ribs go onto the grate over this drip pan, away from the heat. To set up a two-burner gas grill for indirect grilling, light one side and cook the ribs on the unlit side. On a three-burner gas grill, light the outside or front and rear burners, and cook the ribs over the unlit burner in the center. On a four- to six-burner gas grill, light the outside burners and, again, cook the ribs in the center. On a kamado-style grill, insert the heat diffuser, a ceramic plate that separates the food from the fire. Pellet grills, by their very design, grill indirectly, so no special setup is needed. Note that with all these types of grills, the lid must be closed.

Wood smoke has been called the umami of barbecue. It is certainly barbecue's soul. While you can make delectable baby back ribs without wood smoke, as the French and Brazilians do, they won't taste like American barbecue. So which wood to use? Debate rages in barbecue circles over the superiority of apple versus cherry, hickory versus mesquite, or whether to employ a combination of several woods. Mesquite lends the strongest flavor, but any hardwood chunk or chip will deliver the requisite smokiness. I smoked the ribs in my recipe with cherry wood, simply because I had it on hand. To smoke ribs on a charcoal grill, add hardwood chunks or soaked, drained hardwood chips to the embers. (Soaking helps slow the rate of combustion, so the chips smolder and smoke before they catch fire.) In a kamado, intersperse the chunks or chips with the charcoal. A pellet grill has the wood, and smoke, built into the pellets. (Note: On a pellet grill you get more smoke flavor at lower temperatures, so lengthen the cooking time accordingly.) It's harder, but not impossible, to smoke on a gas grill. If your grill has a smoker box with a dedicated burner, add chunks or chips there. If not, place a few hardwood chunks under the grate, directly over the burners. Or make smoking pouches: Wrap soaked, drained wood chips in heavy-duty foil to form a flat pillow shape. Poke holes at one-inch intervals in the top with the tip of a meat thermometer, to release the smoke. Position the resulting pouches (two for the ribs here) under the grate, directly over the burners. Run the grill on high until you see smoke, then dial the temperature back to 300 degrees. What about smoking ribs indoors? Desperate times like these call for desperate measures. I know it smacks of heresy, but you can achieve a reasonable approximation of barbecued ribs in the oven. Cook them on a rack in a roasting pan at 300 degrees. To add a smoke flavor, mix one-half teaspoon liquid smoke with four tablespoons melted butter, and brush this mixture on both sides of the ribs a few times during the last hour of cooking.

While barbecue sauce isn't mandatory, for most Americans, ribs just don't taste complete without it. This version calls for one of my favorites -- a sweet, smoky blend of molasses, brown sugar and ketchup, with bourbon for kick and chipotle chiles to crank up the heat. Here, too, the sauce goes on in layers -- first brushed on and roasted into the ribs during the last 20 minutes of cooking, then applied again and seared into the meat over high heat, and finally served with the ribs for spooning or dipping. A crucial factor is the sizzle, which involves directly grilling the ribs (move them right over the fire or lit burners) for the final four minutes or so -- long enough to caramelize the brown sugar and molasses, and sear the sauce into the meat. Take care to avoid the cardinal sin of applying the sauce too early, when the ribs first go on the grill. That's what grown-ups did when I was young, and the sugar in the sauce invariably burned long before the meat was cooked. For many years, I thought barbecue was supposed to taste burned. 6. Know when your ribs are done.

Pork ribs come with their own version of the pop-up thermometer that signals that a turkey is done: The meat shrinks back from the ends of the bones. When you see a quarter- to a half-inch of clean bone at the end of each rib, it is ready. You should be able to pull the individual ribs apart with your fingers. The meat should resist, but just a little. Many Americans are accustomed to meat that falls off the bones -- a style that may have begun with the doleful practice of boiling or steaming ribs before grilling. The notion of soft (dare I say mushy?) ribs took root in our collective culinary consciousness. Root out that idea now. Yes, ribs should be tender, but they should definitely retain a little chew. That's why we have teeth.","A backyard grill can easily produce the spicy, smoky slabs that for many are barbecue's ultimate prize.",9b56f2f4-47b6-55de-9c03-fff3d0fdf99b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/29/dining/29Ribs4/29Ribs4-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=98443b3ac7b0ec1b788c136a38c284073408af37ec3c48696546ca0767f8b8a3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Indirect heat keeps the ribs from overcooking.,9b56f2f4-47b6-55de-9c03-fff3d0fdf99b,N24News/imgs/9b56f2f4-47b6-55de-9c03-fff3d0fdf99b.jpg,17
Art & Design,The Met Casts New Light on its Greatest Hits and History,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/24/arts/design/metropolitan-museum-european-paintings-skylights.html,"Left to right, all by Jean Honore Fragonard: ""Roman Interior,"" 1760; ""A Woman with a Dog,"" 1769; ""The Stolen Kiss,"" 1760, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's ""A New Look at Old Masters.""



Goya, Caravaggio, Rubens, Velazquez and more are in skylit splendor in the European galleries. And the museum is acknowledging the shaping force on art of colonialism, slavery, the disenfranchisement of women.

""In a dark time, the eye begins to see,"" the poet wrote. And after the dark, dark time we've been through, this year's winter solstice, marking the start of slow climb back into light, may carry more metaphorical weight than usual. Coincidentally, the Metropolitan Museum of Art has some restorative illumination of its own underway. In recent decades, the skylights that brought natural light into the European paintings galleries had grown timeworn and semi-functional, leaving some spaces half-dark. In 2018, the museum initiated a four-year project to replace all the skylights. The job required that half of the 45 galleries be closed down in two phases and chunks of the collection be temporarily stored or relocated. (The museum's Dutch paintings are on view in the Robert Lehman Wing.) With half of the new skylights now in place, 21 galleries, holding some 500 paintings and a few sculptures, have been reinstalled and reopened. As seen on a recent overcast December afternoon, the new lighting -- natural with some artificial enhancement -- looked good, less dramatic than remembered but even and clear, presumably close to the kind of light that artists working in Europe between 1250 and 1800, the dates that roughly frame the collection, might have painted in.

In galleries once arranged largely by geography and date, they are mixing things up to spotlight transnational exchanges and border-crossings. And they are acknowledging, out loud, in print, the shaping force on art of sociopolitical realities -- colonialism, slavery, the disenfranchisement of women -- that this museum has all but ignored in its permanent collection displays. And it's important they do this, not just to advance historical truth-telling, but to secure and broaden an audience for art. Over the decades I've noticed a decreasing popular interest in the Met's old master galleries, once considered the museum's chief attraction and crown jewels. Maybe this change can be put down to shifts in school education. Almost certainly it is a byproduct of a digital culture that keeps us inexorably pinned to the present. In fact, though, the sociopolitical themes raised in the reinstallation of art from the past are very much of the present. Making that link is essential to attracting an audience into the future.

Changes aren't obvious right away. The high-ceilinged galley at the top of the Grand Staircase isn't officially part of the reinstallation. Devoted to the 18th-century Venetian artist Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, it is a set-piece, a fixture in a museum that is, after all, Tiepolo-Central. There's more work by him here than anywhere outside of Venice. The distant sight of his supersized paintings of angels and gods couched on cumulus clouds are meant to pull you up the stairs, up to heaven, and they do. Why change a winning thing? Innovations begin just beyond, in a gallery that was once a straightforward sampler of Italian Baroque paintings, but now has a more specific theme: Baroque Rome. In the 17th century, Rome was a magnet for artists from all over Europe hungry for Counter-Reformation commissions. Many were Italian; Caravaggio, Guercino and Guido Reni are all here. But so is the youthful Velazquez up from Madrid and, with a charming small picture of the young Virgin Mary, Francisco de Zurbaran, who never left Spain, though the Roman Baroque filtered down to him there.

In the next gallery, called ""Painting as the Mirror of Nature: 1420-1480,"" north and south meet in an exquisite lineup of headshot portraits. Some are Italian, some Netherlandish, a difference being this: The Italian portraits present people as they'd probably wanted to be seen, smooth-skinned and toned; the northern ones show them as they actually were, stubble, frown-lines and all. In Hans Memling's famous dual portraits of Tommaso and Maria Portinari -- Florentines living in the artist's home city of Bruges -- the two approaches merge. Every facial crease is accounted for and the sitters are beautiful. The 15th century was a fluid time for culture. Art and influences traveled, fast and wide. During Memling's lifetime, his work made its way to Italy, France, England and Poland. Painting by a Bruges-based artist of an older generation, the sublime Jan van Eyck, was a hit in Naples, where it may have inspired the Sicilian-born Antonello da Messina to take up and master the Netherlandish medium of oil painting.

Antonello's art is beyond category, stylistically and expressively. His bust-length panel painting ""Christ Crowned With Thorns,"" from around 1470, is both imaginatively fantastic and portrait-specific. Christ's face has the beat-up features of a boxer who's lost a fight and the pleading gaze of a doomed man who just fully understood his fate. One of the strangest and most moving images in the Met's early European holdings, it's unlocatable in every way, outside any this-leads-to-this art historical narrative. The Met favors such narratives -- most big, generalist museums do -- and adheres to them in sections of the new installation. After the gallery of 15th-century portraits comes another centered on religious motifs (the Antonello is here) shared by artists across pre-Reformation Europe. And this is followed by a showcase of fancy Florentine homewares: marriage chests, maiolica jars and commemorative platters. (Lorenzo the Magnificent's birth plate, decorated by the younger artist-brother of the great Masaccio, is a centerpiece.) Then suddenly there's a break in the timeline. You step from 15th-century Italy into 18th-century France and the Rococo world of Fragonard and Watteau. It's a world of pinpoint delicacy and -- in pictures like Fragonard's ""Woman with a Dog"" -- self-amused wit. And, as distilled here, it feels, for all its urbanity, vacuum-packed: all French, all the time. (A gallery of 18th-century British art has a similar feel of being a culturally closed system, an island art.) Emerging from it, you make another leap, this one a back flip to a Pan-European Baroque. And at this point that the curators spotlight the issue of race in a two-paragraph wall text titled ""Slavery, Race, and Ideology in Seventeenth Century Europe."" This is by no means the only mention. Texts in the Renaissance galleries refer to enslaved Africans in 15th-century Antwerp and Florence. Individual labels here and there flag the appearance of Black figures in paintings, cast as Magi in Nativity scenes, or as servants in upscale portraits. In the context of the intense Black Lives Matter consciousness-raising of recent years, this all feels like a mild, late-coming gesture. But in a museum that has, in its permanent collection displays, been all but mute on the subject of racism, it at least starts a conversation. So does a gallery focused on women artists, or on a handful who established careers in Paris after the French Revolution. Their careers had built-in boundaries. Men made ""important"" art: history painting. Women were confined to lesser genres like still life and portraiture.

Yet ""lesser"" produced two of the Met's most moving 18th-century images: Adelaide Labille-Guiard's monumental 1785 ""Self-Portrait with Two Pupils, Marie Capet (1761-1818) and Marie Marguerite Carreaux de Rosemond (died 1788),"" and Elisabeth Louise Vigee Le Brun's intimate portrait of her 7-year-old daughter Julie looking at her own reflection in a hand-held mirror. Fabulous, both. The Vigee Le Brun painting, a study in dawning self -awareness, arrived at the Met, by bequest, just last year. The picture by Labille-Guiard, who advocated for the equality of women and passed her conviction on to the next generation, has been in the collection since the 1950s, and I periodically track it down just to get a fix of her radiant optimism. In the end, the deepest pleasure in having the European painting galleries back -- all 45 will reopen in 2022 -- is the opportunity to revisit friends, many long-familiar, some new. We all have our favorites. Of those now on view in the refurbished spaces, I'll just mention a few of mine.

I'm a longtime fan of Johannes Vermeer's late-1660s ""Study of a Young Woman,"" now part of ""In Praise of Painting: Dutch Masterpieces at the Met"" in the Lehman Wing. Some portrait sitters come across as stiffs or grouches. (Many of Antonello's look like serious troublemakers.). Vermeer's young woman, with her bare brow and wide-set eyes suggests a friendly, ready-to-party E.T., someone I'd like to know. When the Met bought Duccio di Buoninsegna's ""Madonna and Child"" (Gallery 624) for $45 million in 2004, some eyebrows went up. Too much money! Wrong. It was worth every cent, and it's priceless now. Dated to around 1300, it's roughly the size of an iPad and painted in tempera and gold. In it, the infant Jesus pushes aside his mother's veil so he can see her sad face. Their eyes meet. They both know the history to come. The picture may or may not have been made for private worship. Its precise origins are obscure but we can see that it was an object of devout attention. Dark scorch marks from altar candles are still visible on its frame. And today at the Met it still radiates all manner of light.","Goya, Caravaggio, Rubens, Velázquez and more are in skylit splendor in the European galleries.

Movies,Review: Teenage Kicks Go Too Far in 'Flower',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/movies/flower-review-zoey-deutch.html,"Cruelly amoral and only marginally credible, ""Flower"" is nevertheless wildly entertaining and at times even touching. Antic and impulsive, Erica is a smart, damaged bully whose father is in prison and whose mother, Laurie (the great Kathryn Hahn), would rather befriend than parent. The teenager also has a strange fixation on penises, which she gratifies by having close encounters with as many as possible and sketching them in a notebook. It's all very cute, until Laurie's boyfriend and his deeply troubled son (Tim Heidecker and Joey Morgan) move in and the narrative dives off a cliff.

Even so, the fall is propelled by such zippy dialogue and unexpectedly sweet moments (Erica and Laurie's relationship, especially, is warmly believable) that you may not care. The supporting players -- including Adam Scott as a possibly skeevy high school teacher -- are all strong, and the director, Max Winkler (son of Henry), never breaks stride. Making liberal use of dizzying close-ups, he swerves from dark coming-of-age comedy to outright horror, refusing to punish Erica for behavior that grows ever more appalling.",Zoey Deutch gives a magnetic performance as a damaged teenager in this wildly entertaining film.,5a2e4f55-acdb-5d8a-98d7-d86f33df6ec7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/16/movies/16flower1/16flower1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=e4d3a1380a6e4e2b2d7c11c33610e83b6db9ef860390996b2bb79051a62d8c36&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Dylan Gelula, Maya Eshet and Zoey Deutch in ""Flower,"" a cruelly amoral but wildly entertaining movie.",5a2e4f55-acdb-5d8a-98d7-d86f33df6ec7,N24News/imgs/5a2e4f55-acdb-5d8a-98d7-d86f33df6ec7.jpg,5

Technology,Slack's Shares Plunge After It Predicts a Larger Loss,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/technology/slack-earnings.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- The reality of being a public company is setting in for what were once some of Silicon Valley's hottest start-ups. The latest to get a taste of that: Slack. In its first earnings report since going public in June, Slack posted a bigger loss than a year ago and a 58 percent rise in revenue as its spending increased, owing partly to costs related to going public. The company, which makes business software, also projected that its losses for the current quarter would be wider than Wall Street expectations, sending its stock plunging more than 15 percent in after-hours trading. Stewart Butterfield, Slack's chief executive, said in an interview that it would take time for the market to understand his company since it had created a new category of software, unlike soda or cars. ""Everyone understands what those things are and why they need them,"" he said. Over time, he added, ""people will develop a more mature understanding"" of Slack.

The results followed months of skepticism about Slack's business. Since the company went public in a direct listing, its shares have steadily fallen. It faces tough competition from bigger and better-funded competitors, including Microsoft. Slack has tried to distinguish itself by saying that it is not distracted by old products or other priorities and that it is completely focused on making software that helps workers collaborate and communicate. Slack's recent performance echoes that of some other once-sizzling start-ups, such as Uber and Lyft, which also went public this year and have stumbled since their offerings. Last month, Uber posted its largest-ever quarterly loss, $5.2 billion, and its slowest-ever growth rate. Investors have questioned whether some of these companies, which are mostly unprofitable, can ever make money. Yet that has not tempered the hype around the I.P.O.s. of tech-related start-ups. WeWork, the unprofitable real estate start-up, and Peloton, the fitness company that is also losing money, are among those preparing to list their shares in the coming months. Rohit Kulkarni, a senior analyst at MKM Partners, said investors were still hungry for fast-growing young companies, though Uber and Lyft's combination of slowing revenue growth and ballooning costs has scared some people. ""As a private company, you can grow at all costs. As a public company, you have to grow at reasonable costs,"" he said.

Slack sells subscriptions to companies whose workers use its software to message one another and work together. Its product was widely used among technology start-ups, before catching on with larger companies. In its offering paperwork, Slack estimated the entire market for workplace collaboration services was $28 billion. For its second fiscal quarter, Slack posted a loss of $364 million, more than 10 times the loss of $32 million from a year earlier. That included $307 million in stock-based compensation and taxes related to the company's direct listing. Revenue rose to $145 million from $92 million a year earlier. Slack said it had more than 100,000 paying customers, a 37 percent increase over last year. But the company said it expected a loss of 8 cents to 9 cents a share in the current quarter, which was larger than analyst expectations of a loss of 7 cents a share. Allen Shim, Slack's chief financial officer, said Slack was making progress toward profitability, but was focused on investing in growth. ""That drive for growth is something you will see pay off over the quarters,"" Mr. Butterfield said.","The business software company, which went public amid a wave of hype in June, got a taste of the reality of being a public company.",9445d59f-dc61-57a4-be7f-8dbf16a9d875,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/05/business/05SLACKprint/merlin_156757275_a9985d03-c5f9-424e-af13-42065f142d5b-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=fa5fa98f72415fe292610ffae29815a791613824a86bb0d14b937fc4984c86f2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Stewart Butterfield, Slack&rsquo;s chief executive, during the company&rsquo;s stock debut in June.",9445d59f-dc61-57a4-be7f-8dbf16a9d875,N24News/imgs/9445d59f-dc61-57a4-be7f-8dbf16a9d875.jpg,20
Books,An Enthralling and Terrifying History of the Nuclear Meltdown at Chernobyl,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/books/review-midnight-chernobyl-adam-higginbotham.html,"[ This was selected as one of the Book Review's 10 best books of 2019. See the full list. ] The word ""Chernobyl"" has long been synonymous with the catastrophic reactor explosion of 1986 -- grim shorthand for what still qualifies, more than three decades later, as the world's worst nuclear disaster. As infamous as it is now, it's easy to forget that the calamity seemed to drift to international attention as if by accident. A full two days after the meltdown began in Ukraine, with winds carrying radioactive fallout into Europe, alarms went off at a nuclear power station in faraway Sweden. Only then did Soviet officials deign to release a terse statement acknowledging ""an accident has taken place,"" while studiously neglecting to mention the specifics of what had happened or when. ""Aid is being given to those affected,"" the statement concluded. ""A government commission has been set up."" In his chilling new book, ""Midnight in Chernobyl,"" the journalist Adam Higginbotham shows how an almost fanatical compulsion for secrecy among the Soviet Union's governing elite was part of what made the accident not just cataclysmic but so likely in the first place. Interviewing eyewitnesses and consulting declassified archives -- an official record that was frustratingly meager when it came to certain details and, Higginbotham says, couldn't always be trusted -- he reconstructs the disaster from the ground up, recounting the prelude to it as well as its aftermath. The result is superb, enthralling and necessarily terrifying.

Higginbotham spends the first part of the book narrating a pre-disaster idyll filled with technological optimism, glowing with possibility. Named for a nearby medieval town, the Chernobyl nuclear station was built in the 1970s, intended as ""the new power plant that would one day make the U.S.S.R.'s nuclear engineering famous across the globe."" Such blithe examples of confidence show up in Higginbotham's book like Chekhov's gun, waiting to go off. An ""atomic city"" called Pripyat was erected, a mere 10-minute drive from the plant, to house the influx of nuclear scientists and support staff. In a Soviet Union beset by economic stagnation and deprivation, Pripyat was an ""oasis of plenty"" -- ""a true workers' paradise."" Grocery shops were stocked with hard-to-find delicacies; a department store featured Austrian dining sets and French perfume. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books?

Underneath it all, however, was the creaking foundation of a Soviet empire whose nuclear program was governed by a combination of ""ruthless expedience"" and a perpetual fear of humiliation. Nuclear power was pursued as an economic panacea and a source of prestige, with Politburo officials imposing preposterous timetables and equally preposterous cost-cutting measures. Higginbotham describes young workers who were promoted swiftly to positions of terrific responsibility. In an especially glaring example of entrenched cronyism, the Communist Party elevated an ideologically copacetic electrical engineer to the position of deputy plant director at Chernobyl: To make up for a total lack of experience with atomic energy, he took a correspondence course in nuclear physics.

Even more egregious than some personnel decisions were the structural problems built into the plant itself. Most fateful for Chernobyl was the baffling design of a crucial safety feature: control rods that could be lowered into the reactor core to slow down the process of nuclear fission. The rods contained boron carbide, which hampered reactivity, but the Soviets decided to tip them in graphite, which facilitated reactivity; it was a bid to save energy, and therefore money, by lessening the rods' moderating effect. Higginbotham calls it ""an absurd and chilling inversion in the role of a safety device,"" likening it to wiring a car so that slamming the brakes would make it accelerate. When the book arrives at the early hours of April 26, 1986, the accident unfurls with a horrible inevitability. Weaving together the experiences of those who were there that night, Higginbotham marshals the details so meticulously that every step feels spring-loaded with tension. What started as a long overdue safety test of Chernobyl's Reactor No. 4 slipped quickly into a full-scale meltdown. An attempted shutdown using the graphite-tipped control rods of course had the opposite effect; the core grew hotter and hotter, and the reactor started to destroy itself. Higginbotham describes an excruciating aftermath, as Pripyat's residents were coaxed into a ""temporary"" evacuation and middle-aged reservists were drafted into a haphazard cleanup process -- though ""cleanup"" doesn't convey the perilous, Sisyphean ordeal they faced. Soviet officials referred to the process as ""liquidation,"" which sounded more effective and definitive than it was. ""Radionuclides,"" Higginbotham writes, ""could be neither broken down nor destroyed -- only relocated, entombed or interred."" The protective gloves given to the reservists turned out to be so cumbersome that some of the men cleared radioactive debris with their bare hands. Robots, deployed in an attempt to protect vulnerable humans with supposedly hardy machines, were rendered useless, as radiation scrambled their circuitry. The Soviet strategy of secrecy compounded with denial only made rumor-mongering worse, as some Western newspapers resorted to ""unconfirmed reports"" of 15,000 dead a week after the accident. Five months later, the official death toll of those directly killed by the event stood at 31, a figure that doesn't include those who died from the effects of radiation exposure in the years that followed. Amid so much rich reporting and scrupulous analysis, some major themes emerge. One has to do with how Chernobyl exposed the untenable fissures in the Soviet system and hastened its collapse; the accident also encouraged Mikhail Gorbachev to pursue drastic reforms with even more zeal.

Higginbotham observes that the plant was run like the Soviet state writ large -- with individuals expected to carry out commands from on high with an automaton's acquiescence. At the same time, when it came time to assess responsibility for the disaster, any collectivist fellow feeling evaporated, as the ensuing show trials insistently scapegoated a few individuals (some of them already dead) in a desperate attempt to keep a crumbling system intact. The accident also decimated international confidence in nuclear power, and a number of countries halted their own programs -- for a time, that is. Global warming has made the awesome potential of the atom a source of hope again and, according to some advocates, an urgent necessity; besides, as Higginbotham points out, nuclear power, from a statistical standpoint, is safer than the competing alternatives, including wind.

Automobiles,Teenage Endurance Driver Takes Exams While Preparing for Le Mans,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/13/automobiles/teenage-endurance-driver-takes-exams-while-preparing-for-le-mans.html,"Latif's school, Marlborough College , which is in England, allowed him to take his exams in a Paris suburb while he prepared for Le Mans.

PARIS -- Alessandro Latif didn't betray any emotion while waiting for his exams to begin on the campus of the British School of Paris in Le Vesinet, a suburb of the French capital. But you could sense his excitement, nervousness and fatigue. These, however, were not pre-exam blues. Instead, the 18-year-old's thoughts were on his debut this weekend at one of the world's greatest motorsports events, the Le Mans 24-hour race. He will be driving a 500-horsepower machine in the ultracompetitive LMP2 category, hitting top speeds in excess of 180 miles per hour at the circuit in western France. Competing in a demanding race at such a young age will be a challenge for Latif, who will be driving a Zytec Z11SN Nissan for Greaves Motorsport along with his teammates, Michael Munemann and James Winslow. What has made the task even more daunting is that his dream race fell right in the middle of his A-level exams, something he was not willing to skip. Latif, along with his teammates, Michael Munemann and James Winslow, are driving a Zytec Z11SN Nissan for Greaves Motorsport. As a result, his school in Britain, Marlborough College, allowed him to appear for this week's exams in Paris. While Latif, who is British-Italian with Indian and Pakistani lineage, was happy that his school made this concession, he still had to travel to Paris from Le Mans and back for three straight days.

On Tuesday morning he appeared for his math exam and returned to Le Mans at noon for the drivers' autograph session. On Wednesday, he reached Le Vesinet around noon, took an exam at 2 p.m. and left to return to Le Mans at 4 p.m., arriving just in time for a free practice and qualifying session. He followed the same schedule on Thursday, taking his exam and returning to Le Mans for the second qualifying session, which was from 8 p.m. to midnight. Switching from exam to racing mode and vice versa has worn Latif down mentally, he said. His mind has had to vacillate between talking with engineers about race strategy and considering the laws of motion and solving quadratic equations for his physics and mathematics exams. ""I don't get enough time to rest my mind,"" he said. ""There are so many things going on at any given time.""

He concedes that had it not been for the race, he would have been much better prepared for these exams. ""My mind is not completely in the exam,"" he said. ""Also, the fact that I don't get time to do last-minute revision is not helping me."" But he said that he could not have abandoned the opportunity to race this weekend. ""Originally, when the season started, there was no plan of racing at Le Mans this year,"" he said. ""But when the opportunity arose, it was a dream come true for me. I had to grab it up no matter what. Sitting for exams before the race is hard, but i think I can manage."" What has helped him, he said, is the advice he got from a Le Mans legend, Tom Christensen, the nine-time Le Mans winner. He told Latif that sometimes it's good to be away from the Le Mans scene during the build up to the race to recharge one's energy. Latif behind the wheel of the team's Greaves Motorsport Nissan. ""In the end, it might turn out to be a good distraction,"" Latif said. Latif, who started racing at age 10, has never been troubled by the thought of making a choice between racing and studies. He wants to pursue both and says he plans to pursue a degree in automotive or mechanical engineering. ""If I get my engineering degree, it will help me converse with the engineers in their language,"" he said. ""These days, there are lot of quick drivers. However, besides speed, you also need to be clever in the way you manage yourself.""","For Alessandro Latif, the choice between taking his college exams and competing in his first Le Mans 24-Hour race was impossible.

Health,Searching for the Genetic Underpinnings of Morning Persons and Night Owls,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/health/morning-person-genes.html,"Early to bed and early to rise is a maxim that's easy to follow for some people, and devilishly hard for others.

Now, in a study published Tuesday in Nature Communications, researchers curious about the genetic underpinnings of chronotype -- whether you are a morning person, a night owl or somewhere in between -- looked at about 700,000 people's genomes. They identified 351 variations that may be connected to when people go to bed. While these variants are just the beginning of exploring the differences in chronotypes, the study goes on to suggest tantalizing links between chronotype and mental health.

The researchers drew on data from 23andMe, the genetic testing company, and the UK Biobank, which tracks hundreds of thousands of volunteer subjects in Britain, about 85,000 of whom wear activity monitors that record their movements.

Those data were key, said Michael Weedon, a bioinformaticist at University of Exeter in England and an author of the new paper; earlier studies had relied only on people's subjective opinions of whether they were morning people. Using the activity monitors, however, the team was able to confirm that self-reported morning people did go to sleep earlier -- and people with the most morning-linked gene variants went to bed 25 minutes earlier than people with the fewest. Morning people did not sleep longer or better than night people; all that differed was the time that they went to sleep.",Researchers identified hundreds of gene variations that may be connected to when people go to bed.,83941e40-4b09-5dd0-aefe-179944c4c71f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/05/science/31TB-SLEEPGENES/31TB-SLEEPGENES-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=d77549fc2f4510ef2752cba3e7f44d4fc85666a819f92609d349e3a2176b1397&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A guard at a museum in Gdansk, Poland, is, like all of us, a slave to his chronotype.",83941e40-4b09-5dd0-aefe-179944c4c71f,N24News/imgs/83941e40-4b09-5dd0-aefe-179944c4c71f.jpg,1

Health,"Older Children Spread the Coronavirus Just as Much as Adults, Large Study Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/18/health/coronavirus-children-schools.html,"In the heated debate over reopening schools, one burning question has been whether and how efficiently children can spread the virus to others. A large new study from South Korea offers an answer: Children younger than 10 transmit to others much less often than adults do, but the risk is not zero. And those between the ages of 10 and 19 can spread the virus at least as well as adults do. The findings suggest that as schools reopen, communities will see clusters of infection take root that include children of all ages, several experts cautioned. ""I fear that there has been this sense that kids just won't get infected or don't get infected in the same way as adults and that, therefore, they're almost like a bubbled population,"" said Michael Osterholm, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota.

""There will be transmission,"" Dr. Osterholm said. ""What we have to do is accept that now and include that in our plans."" Several studies from Europe and Asia have suggested that young children are less likely to get infected and to spread the virus. But most of those studies were small and flawed, said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. The new study ""is very carefully done, it's systematic and looks at a very large population,"" Dr. Jha said. ""It's one of the best studies we've had to date on this issue."" Other experts also praised the scale and rigor of the analysis. South Korean researchers identified 5,706 people who were the first to report Covid-19 symptoms in their households between Jan. 20 and March 27, when schools were closed, and then traced the 59,073 contacts of these ""index cases."" They tested all of the household contacts of each patient, regardless of symptoms, but only tested symptomatic contacts outside the household. The first person in a household to develop symptoms is not necessarily the first to have been infected, and the researchers acknowledged this limitation. Children are also less likely than adults to show symptoms, so the study may have underestimated the number of children who set off the chain of transmission within their households.

Still, experts said the approach was reasonable. ""It is also from a place with great contact tracing, done at the point interventions were being put in place,"" said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Children under 10 were roughly half as likely as adults to spread the virus to others, consistent with other studies. That may be because children generally exhale less air -- and therefore less virus-laden air -- or because they exhale that air closer to the ground, making it less likely that adults would breathe it in.
* Who should get a booster shot? It depends, Dr. Scott Gottlieb says.
* Virginia's new lieutenant governor-elect says she won't force vaccines. Even so, the number of new infections seeded by children may rise when schools reopen, the study authors cautioned. ""Young children may show higher attack rates when the school closure ends, contributing to community transmission of Covid-19,"" they wrote. Other studies have also suggested that the large number of contacts for schoolchildren, who interact with dozens of others for a good part of the day, may cancel out their smaller risk of infecting others. The researchers traced the contacts only of children who felt ill, so it's still unclear how efficiently asymptomatic children spread the virus, said Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""I think it was always going to be the case that symptomatic children are infectious,"" she said. ""The questions about the role of children are more around whether children who don't have symptoms are infectious."" Dr. Rivers was a member of a scientific panel that on Wednesday recommended reopening schools wherever possible for disabled children and for those in elementary schools, because those groups have the most trouble learning online. She said the new study does not alter that recommendation. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The study is more worrisome for children in middle and high school. This group was even more likely to infect others than adults were, the study found. But some experts said that finding may be a fluke or may stem from the children's behaviors.

These older children are frequently as big as adults, and yet may have some of the same unhygienic habits as young children do. They may also have been more likely than the younger children to socialize with their peers within the high-rise complexes in South Korea. ""We can speculate all day about this, but we just don't know,"" Dr. Osterholm said. ""The bottom line message is: There's going to be transmission."" He and other experts said schools will need to prepare for infections to pop up. Apart from implementing physical distancing, hand hygiene and masks, schools should also decide when and how to test students and staff -- including, for example, bus drivers -- when and how long to require people to quarantine, and when to decide to close and reopen schools. But they face a monumental challenge because the evidence on transmission within schools has been far from conclusive so far, experts said. Some countries like Denmark and Finland have successfully reopened schools, but others, like China, Israel and South Korea, have had to close them down again. ""People, depending on their ideology on school opening, are choosing which evidence to present -- and that needs to be avoided,"" said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in New York. Although the new study does not offer definitive answers, he said, it does indicate that schools can increase virus levels within a community. ""So long as children are not just a complete dead end -- incapable of passing the virus on, which does not seem to be the case -- putting them together in schools, having them mix with teachers and other students will provide additional opportunities for the virus to move from person to person,"" he said.","The study of nearly 65,000 people in South Korea suggests that school reopenings will trigger more outbreaks.",3714c13c-68e8-5002-8c75-b0f29941728f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/18/science/18virus--kids/merlin_174135054_aed03bad-4e4b-4a8f-8ee7-b89113da5478-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c099df70e3317dc45c33013eec158dcd4e09085f75a1fd3d5642bb172bc1b884&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Students, parents and teachers of Cheondong Elementary School in Daejeon, South Korea, got tested in early July after two students were found to be infected with the virus.",3714c13c-68e8-5002-8c75-b0f29941728f,N24News/imgs/3714c13c-68e8-5002-8c75-b0f29941728f.jpg,1
Technology,Stephen Bannon Buys Into Bitcoin,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/technology/steve-bannon-bitcoin.html,"WASHINGTON -- Stephen K. Bannon, 10 months removed from the job of chief strategist to President Trump and five months after his ouster from the arch-conservative news site Breitbart News, is betting that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can disrupt banking the way Mr. Trump disrupted American politics. Mr. Bannon won't reveal very much about his cryptocurrency plans -- he worries that the controversy that comes with his name could have a bad impact on projects just getting off the ground. But he has had private meetings with cryptocurrency investors and hedge funds where he has discussed working on so-called initial coin offerings through his investment business, Bannon & Company. And in his first interview on the topic, he said he had a ""good stake"" in Bitcoin. In a small gathering of academics at Harvard University this spring, he even floated the possibility of creating a new virtual currency, the ""deplorables coin."" The name is a nod to Hillary Clinton's description of Mr. Trump's supporters as ""a basket of deplorables.""



The work that Mr. Bannon is doing in the virtual currency realm is still in its early stages. But he has expressed an interest in helping entrepreneurs and even countries looking to create their own cryptocurrencies -- generally outside the United States. The offbeat world of cryptocurrencies has drawn interest from all sorts over the last few years, from drug dealers and scam artists to the biggest companies in Silicon Valley and the most staid institutions of Wall Street. It is not a shocking place for Mr. Bannon, 64, to plot his re-emergence. Cryptocurrencies have many of the characteristics that drew him into Tea Party politics: They break old rules, they exist on the periphery and they pose a challenge to the powerful figures and institutions that have long called the shots. ""It's disruptive populism,"" Mr. Bannon said in the interview at his Capitol Hill townhouse in Washington. ""It takes control back from central authorities. It's revolutionary."" Even though he has no formal ties to the business anymore, Mr. Bannon still refers to his townhouse as the Breitbart Embassy, the nickname given to it because so much of the site's business was done there.

He won't talk about a possible return to politics someday. His messy rupture with the White House over critical comments he made in Michael Wolff's book ""Fire and Fury"" about colleagues and Donald Trump Jr. is still too fresh. But he does see a political component to virtual currency. ""It was pretty obvious to me that unless you got somehow control over your currency, all these political movements were going to be beholden to who controlled the currency,"" Mr. Bannon said. His vision for virtual currency has elements of his unorthodox ideology. He sounds like both an avowed libertarian who wants government out of his life and a progressive who wants Wall Street held to account when he insists that virtual currencies can help citizens take back power from the central banks that ""debase your currency"" and make citizens ""slaves to debt."" His focus on creating new digital tokens, which are usually offered through initial coin offerings, puts him squarely in the edgiest, most scam-filled slice of the cryptocurrency business. New companies have raised billions through these I.C.O.s, which allow them to bypass regulators and other middlemen and go straight to investors. That has also led to plenty of scams, and authorities throughout the world are starting to crack down.

Mr. Bannon's involvement in cryptocurrencies has raised eyebrows among people trying to move the business toward the mainstream. They fear he will further cement the technology's reputation as a plaything of fringe elements. ""It almost seems like a natural progression for a man who gained prominence by shoveling out unfounded conspiracies to now shilling complex technology and financial instruments to an unsophisticated investing public,"" said Colin Platt, a cryptocurrency researcher and adviser. Bitcoin are stored and moved around a global network of computers that allows for the system to work without relying on a central authority. That lack of oversight has made Bitcoin a favorite method of payment for online drug markets and ransom schemes.

Bitcoin has been popular with the alt-right and nationalist communities because it has provided them with a way to receive online donations and evade restrictions put on them by banks and payment companies. PayPal and Apple Pay, for example, shut down the accounts of some right-wing groups last year. Cryptocurrencies are also gaining mainstream interest. Goldman Sachs, where Mr. Bannon worked in the 1980s, recently said it was creating a Bitcoin trading operation. The parent company of the New York Stock Exchange has been looking at building an exchange for digital tokens. And Facebook has put top executives on a project exploring use of the technology.

Timothy Lewis, a hedge fund manager who met with Mr. Bannon to talk about cryptocurrencies last month, said he was impressed with the degree to which Mr. Bannon had delved into the details of the technology and the challenges it faces. ""I didn't know what to expect going in, but he had clearly done his homework,"" said Mr. Lewis, who is a co-founder of the Ikigai hedge fund, which invests in cryptocurrency projects. He said they had talked about the laws governing new cryptocurrencies and a few initial coin offerings that had recently raised money from investors. Mr. Bannon is particularly interested in the possibility that countries could create coins tied to national wealth -- an Italian coin tied to marble deposits in the country, for instance. He found his way into the virtual currency universe through Brock Pierce, a former child actor who appeared in films like ""The Mighty Ducks"" before starting a company in Hong Kong that sold the virtual gold that players use in the video game World of Warcraft. The company, Internet Gaming Entertainment, or IGE, brought on Mr. Bannon as vice chairman in 2005 to help Mr. Pierce expand the business and deal with legal threats. Mr. Bannon credits the company with introducing him to the ranks of disaffected young men who gathered online around video games, and who became pillars of the alt-right movement.","He was pushed out of the White House and then Breitbart News. Now he is focused on cryptocurrencies, which he thinks can disrupt the financial world.",3455dc43-71d4-5703-9adb-cae3dd5b3ae4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/09/business/09BANNON/09BANNON-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=720d9336de6f4474fcf188765e22729a0166bc154774f68f55775bd71feee6b6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Describing cryptocurrencies as ""disruptive populism,"" Stephen K.

Travel,An Artist Colony Thrives in the South African Desert,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/travel/prince-albert-south-africa-artist-colony.html,"The main highway between Johannesburg and Cape Town takes travelers through the Great Karoo, a vast desert of reddish-brown earth speckled with scrub vegetation and seemingly populated by nothing more than a loping springbok or two. Few overseas visitors venture off the road. Yet a 20-mile byway leads miragelike to an oasis of sorts, a dusty Afrikaans dorp, or farming village, in a surprisingly fertile patch watered by a stream flowing down the northern slopes of the soaring Swartberg Mountains. It's like suddenly coming across Brigadoon while hiking in the Scottish highlands or spying the Emerald City after a long trek on the Yellow Brick Road. The village, Prince Albert, sometimes has the look of a sleepy frontier settlement out of the old American West, but it is known among travel connoisseurs for pristine examples of 19th-century Cape Dutch architecture, with their signature rounded gables, and for tasty figs and olives, and grazing sheep that are raised for mohair and the most tender lamb. Improbably, in recent decades, a lively colony of artists and crafts makers has sprung up there.

Of course there's ambivalence in trumpeting Prince Albert because what makes it exceptional is its aura of being undiscovered. Nevertheless, tourists are increasingly finding their way there just as the village is increasingly finding ways to entice European, Asian and American travelers who can now visit South Africa without the discomfort of spending money in a land under the chokehold of apartheid. Frankly, we didn't do much more than stroll the colorful main road, swim at our lodge's pool, and gaze at the backdrop of soaring mountains in daylight and an astronomer's dream of a starlit sky at night. The adventure of driving the dizzying switchbacks of a gravel mountain pass straddled by craggy pinnacles is a reason some travelers will take the long way via Prince Albert toward the fabled, lush Garden Route on the Indian Ocean coast. We took a similar path, though nervous about driving under the British left-side-of-the-road system along sheer-drop cliffs, we chose a gentler paved mountain pass. My wife, a native who left South Africa 50 years ago but returns every few years to visit family, needs to renew her communion with the landscape whose beauty is lodged inextricably in her soul.

""There's definitely one with a tummy, and another, dare I say it, a bottom! Kurt Steiner, a gallery owner, told us. ""The townsfolk are very divided in opinion. There are those who believe in Richard's approach, and others even more fervently think the carvings to be nothing less than desecration."" We encountered an antique wagon permanently parked in front of the village museum as a reminder of the 18th-century pioneers who crossed the Karoo and the Swartbergs to farm. Nearby we passed the Showroom theater, built in 2013 in streamlined Art Deco by a local filmmaker who worked on the movie ""The Long Walk to Freedom,"" about Nelson Mandela's struggle to end apartheid. (It was showing more lighthearted fare when we were there.) We even came across a yoga studio, evidence of the village's more recent residents.

At the Watershed, a building housing a row of galleries, we studied photographs by Jurgen Schadeberg, a German expatriate who settled in Johannesburg and built a career out of photographing the struggles of South African blacks, particularly such heroes as Nelson Mandela. As a photographer for Drum, a South African magazine, he trained a generation of black photographers who captured such images as the humiliating ""Tauza"" dance that naked prisoners were forced to perform to show guards they had no weapons. Silver prints, signed by the artist, were on sale -- for $4,800 each. They included the iconic one of Mandela, as the nation's president, visiting his prison cell on Robben Island in 1994 and a smiling young Mandela outside a 1958 trial in which he and 50 others were accused of treason, though found not guilty.

There were works by local artists like J.P. Meyer, who paints blurry, sepia-toned scenes of men and boys in athletic poses. Watershed also sells pillows whose covers feature more whimsical Schadeberg photographs like that of an African jazz trio wreathed in a nightclub's cigarette smoke. We came away with a shapely ceramic vase whose design of pink flecks was created by Mr. Meyer. It now sits in our living room. Prince Albert is home to 30 painters, sculptors, designers and crafts makers, Mr. Steiner, Watershed's owner, informed us. They are drawn by the village's serenity and seclusion. Their paintings and sculptures are available down the main road at the Gallery, which also has a busy cafe. When I asked Mr. Steiner when Prince Albert became an artist's colony, his answer was gently admonishing of a Western perspective: ""The first artists to make their mark,"" he said, ""were the Khoi-San who interpreted this arid ancient stretch of territory on the walls of caves and rock faces."" Khoi-San is the catchall term for two groups of southern Africa's indigenous blacks who are not speakers of Bantu languages, as the majority Zulu and Xhosa are. Known for the clicking sounds of their consonants, they had herded, foraged and hunted along the Swartberg slopes for thousands of years until they were gradually displaced by Bantu expansion some 1,500 years ago, and then pushed out by musket-wielding white settlers in the mid-18th century. The settlers derogatorily called them Hottentots (Khoi) and Bushmen (San). Their descendants today number about 400,000 and are scattered around southern Africa, principally in arid areas like the Kalahari. The Fransie Pienaar Museum has photographs of rock paintings but is short on Khoi-San history. Rock paintings, which were done with ingredients like eland blood and egg white, depict elephants, eland and other animals as well as processions of hunters and other scenes of daily life. For those who have the time, there are a number of areas across South Africa where a visitor can see actual rock paintings, a prime location being the Cederberg mountain range two hours north of Cape Town. It has more than 500 painting sites, including a two-and-a-half mile rock-art trail and others accessible by hikers. The rooms of the Pienaar museum chronicle the story of Prince Albert's ""founding"" in 1762, a century after Dutch traders first came to this part of Africa, and are stuffed with 19th- and early-20th-century tools, dishware, telephones, typewriters, musical instruments, guns and other settler gadgets. After crossing the Karoo (a Khoisan word meaning desert) by wagon, the farmers Zacharias and Dina De Beer planted fruit orchards, vineyards and wheat fields. Other farmers followed and by 1855 the village could support a Dutch Reformed minister. A steepled church was built 10 years later, and it still dominates the village.

You learn from the museum that a nearby railroad line from Cape Town, the carving of the tortuous pass through the Swartbergs, a short-lived boom in ostrich feathers for Europeans and a gold rush that fizzled all contributed to the growth of the village, which today has 7,000 inhabitants, roughly 86 percent of mixed-race, 11 percent white and 2 percent black. Back outside, it is hard not to be struck by the sharp contrast, even in the new South Africa, between the comfortable routines and living quarters of white residents and tourists, and the more pinched lives and flimsy shacks of the mixed-race and black residents who work in the hotels, shops and farms that are owned and managed by whites. On the streets, barefoot children sometimes pose for photographs, hoping for a few rand. Prince Albert is known for its food and on our strolls we indulged. Sitting in the shade of a quiet side garden of the Lazy Lizard cafe, we munched on crisp loaves of homemade bread and a Karoo Plate, stocked with a cornucopia of the Karoo's offerings -- lamb, cheese, Bulgarian yogurt, figs and olives. The source of the yogurt and cheese is Prince Albert's landmark Gay's Guernsey Dairy. Gay van Hasselt welcomes visitors with a jaunty flair, recalling how she started the farm, in 1990 with three cows and a stone kraal (barn). She now has 50 cows. She is proud that the villagers got used to thinking of yogurt, sometimes sweetened with flavors like strawberry -- not as vrot melk -- milk gone bad, but as a tart treat. When the January desert heat proved enervating, we returned to our inn, De Bergkant Lodge, built in 1858 for a newlywed couple, one of 14 local buildings declared historic monuments, and swam laps to the sound of birdsong. The Swiss owners, Michi and Renate Soennichsen, dote on their guests. Both the restaurants they recommended were of high caliber and cost no more than an inexpensive Manhattan spot. At the Olive Branch, a cozy, unpretentious room, Hendry Olivier, the chef, explained how he slow-cooked the lamb for four hours. After tasting it, we concluded there must be a virtue in grazing in a desert. Somewhat more offbeat was Karoo Kombuis -- or Karoo Kitchen -- which is in a simple cottage on a back street. It has just three tables with checkered tablecloths in the front room and three in the back room. A blackboard on the narrow patio serves as the menu but offers only three entrees -- though you can order any two in smaller portions. The restaurant's other rules are cash only, bring booze and find the toilet through the kitchen.","Isolated in the Great Karoo, the 18th-century village of Prince Albert is appreciated for its languid charm, Cape Dutch architecture and its food traditions.",8e6a6dd1-3f19-5e4a-9a27-db09337fe3fb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/14/travel/31princealbert1/31princealbert1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=a0c044d3ded21417fcb88666b24e92082328a73edaa3f55eb1fc3099a66c20e1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"On the outskirts of the village of Prince Albert in the Great Karoo, South Africa's vast desert.",8e6a6dd1-3f19-5e4a-9a27-db09337fe3fb,N24News/imgs/8e6a6dd1-3f19-5e4a-9a27-db09337fe3fb.jpg,4
Technology,Monitoring the Health of a Backup Drive,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/technology/personaltech/backup-drive-health.html,"Q. I've been backing up my computer to two different external hard drives -- one made by Seagate and the other by Western Digital. The backup drives are now six years old. I know hard drives fail after a while, so when should I replace these drives with new ones?

A. The life span of hard disk drives, both internal and external, can be difficult to predict. The mechanical state of the drive's motor, the number of hours the drive has been in use and its environmental conditions are just a few factors that could alter its condition. Manufacturer warranties on the hardware -- often two or three years for consumer-focused products -- are no guarantee of the drive's life expectancy, either.

While it may not be possible to predict exactly when an external drive will fail, closely monitoring the device for grinding noises or other erratic behavior (like unusual slowness) can offer clues to its health. Many manufacturers, including Seagate and Western Digital, offer utility and diagnostic programs in the support areas of their sites. You can use these programs to periodically test the health and file systems of your drives.","Hard drives don't last forever, but utility programs and careful observation can help you decide when it's time to replace a backup drive.",74843baf-2768-5d22-8ac7-0516f703d3be,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/06/technology/personaltech/06techtipwebART/04techtipwebART-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=b699f6f3de56e7b42705344837b6248bfc1dae1cb117fd543d3ddb8f4087aa44&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Utility programs offered by backup-drive manufacturers allow you to test the health of your external hard disk.,74843baf-2768-5d22-8ac7-0516f703d3be,N24News/imgs/74843baf-2768-5d22-8ac7-0516f703d3be.jpg,20
Health,Your Uber Driver Is 'Retired'? You Shouldn't Be Surprised,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/health/seniors-nontraditional-jobs.html,"Your Uber Driver Is 'Retired'? You Shouldn't Be Surprised

Dave Zarrow, who lives in Reston, Va., figures he spends about 20 hours a week in his 2017 Camry driving for Uber, the ride-hailing company. A former small business owner who segued into teaching, he and his wife have left their full-time jobs and could comfortably retire. Even without the $15 to $20 an hour he earns driving, ""we would have been O.K.,"" he said. But at 68, ""I get antsy just sitting around,"" Mr. Zarrow explained. He likes the flexibility of this nontraditional job -- no benefits and unpredictable income, but the ability to set his own hours -- and his conversations with riders. Besides, his earnings help pay for visits to far-flung children and grandchildren and other extras. ""It's allowed us to continue the same lifestyle we had before we retired,"" he said, without eroding their savings.

He is not the kind of older worker in a nontraditional job that economists worry about. They worry about people like Gary Ellenbogen, 64, who has spent three years driving for rival Lyft. Once a self-employed business coach and ski instructor, Mr. Ellenbogen worked in corporate sales for several years, then got laid off in his 50s. He has struggled to find steadier work ever since. ""Nobody's interested in someone my age,"" he said. Despite spending 40 to 60 hours a week picking up riders in his 2015 Subaru Forester, Mr. Ellenbogen is barely surviving financially. He had to give up his apartment and move into his mother's condo in Verona, N.J. He relies on Medicaid for health care. ""It's something I'm accepting because I'm in need of money,"" he said of his Lyft gig. ""I'm capable of better things, but this is what's available to me."" Economists debate how to define this kind of employment, often categorized as ""nontraditional jobs"" or ""alternative work arrangements,"" and how to calculate the proportion of the older work force engaged in it.

Popularly seen as the province of the young, it now provides work for a growing number of people in their 50s, 60s and beyond. The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics includes independent contractors (who may be self-employed but well compensated) and estimates that 11.4 percent of those aged 50 to 62 have nontraditional jobs. The Government Accountability Office, using an even broader definition including part-timers, says the figure is 31.2 percent. Among workers over 62, economists at The New School's Retirement Equity Lab have found that 9 percent were in ""on-call, temp, contract or gig jobs"" in 2015; the researchers believe the percentage has grown since then. In a just-published report, the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College put the number of nontraditional job holders at about 20 percent of 50- to 62-year-old workers, using data from the national Health and Retirement Study. Their study defines nontraditional jobs as those that provide no health insurance or retirement benefits. ""They're probably low-paid,"" said Alicia Munnell, director of the center. ""Some have erratic schedules."" According to the report, only about a quarter of 50-year-old workers stayed at a traditional job with benefits until age 62; some classified as early retirees may not have left their jobs voluntarily.
* Locast, a nonprofit streaming service for local TV, is shutting down
* Capital One's chief executive was fined after being called a 'repeat offender.' Are these nontraditional options bad jobs? It depends on how they're used. Some nontraditional workers, for instance, can forgo benefits because their spouses have them.

""If people use them to tide themselves over after being laid off, it's better than being unemployed,"" Dr. Munnell said. ""They could be a landing place, keeping people going until they find a new full-time job."" Workers in that category, who use nontraditional jobs only sparingly, had 6 percent lower retirement income at age 62, the study found, than those who held onto traditional positions. But ""that's not how they're used,"" Dr. Munnell pointed out. ""It seems people are stuck in these jobs."" The majority of those in nontraditional jobs at ages 50 to 62 rely on them for most of their employment, and their retirement income at 62 is 26 percent lower than that of employees holding traditional jobs. (Nontraditional jobholders have somewhat higher rates of depression, as well.) Economists generally approve of people extending their work lives, but in most of these cases, ""the jobs they're taking aren't the kind anyone would take because they're interesting,"" said Teresa Ghilarducci, director of The New School's Retirement Equity Lab.

Their prevalence may help explain why so many workers claim Social Security before reaching their full retirement ages, reducing their benefits. When work becomes intermittent and poorly paid, the predictability of a fixed monthly check with cost-of-living increases can feel irresistible. Some nontraditional workers aged 50 to 62 lack a high school diploma, but people with college degrees are also entering this sector. ""They're the ones that had a good job, then had a hiccup -- the recession, a job that moved away -- and had the most to lose,"" Dr. Ghilarducci said. Mr. Ellenbogen, for instance, has a master's degree in social psychology from the University of Vermont. After getting laid off from sales positions and finding a return to business coaching unprofitable, he became a commission-only sales rep for Home Depot, with no base salary or benefits. The company let him go, he said, when retina surgery left him unable to drive for two months. After he recovered, the only work he could find was with Lyft, where about a quarter of drivers are over 50, the company reported last year. Mr. Ellenbogen has searched for jobs on LinkedIn, on Indeed, in local newspapers. The New Start Career Network at Rutgers University has provided free weekly sessions with a coach. Nothing has materialized, so Mr. Ellenbogen keeps driving, trying to delay claiming Social Security to maximize his benefits. How to help support older workers whose precarious employment endangers their retirement? Several states have started IRA programs, but with no mandated employer contribution, it's not clear how much difference they'll make.

Broader national actions -- including more affordable and accessible health care -- would be more effective, Dr. Munnell said. Dr. Ghilarducci and her colleagues have proposed ""guaranteed retirement accounts"" with professional management, required employer contributions and payouts over a lifetime. Even if Washington takes action to shore up retirement security, however, relief may not come in time for Mr. Ellenbogen. He happened to be at a sales meeting in the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, an experience which left him uninjured but persuaded that ""you must find ways to smile and enjoy today."" But that can be difficult. Earlier this month, a driver went through a stop sign and did almost $6,000 in damage to Mr. Ellenbogen's Subaru. Though insurance will apparently cover the repair, his car has been in the shop for more than two weeks, temporarily leaving him with no way to earn a living.",Older Americans are taking nontraditional jobs in greater numbers.

Economy,Lessons From Rust-Belt Cities That Kept Their Sheen,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/business/economy/rust-belt-cities.html,"St. Cloud, Minn., might look at first blush like one of America's all-too-familiar ailing industrial cities, struggling to hang on to jobs as its companies skip town. Electrolux's planned closing of its chest-freezer plant next year to consolidate its operations in South Carolina was the latest blow, costing some 900 jobs. As Tama Theis, local Republican state legislator, told The Saint Cloud Times, ""Gosh dang it, that's a hard one."" And yet despite the loss of its fifth-largest employer, the sleepy city straddling the Mississippi 65 miles northwest of Minneapolis doesn't at all fit the tale of woe that spread across the Midwest over the last 50 years. If anything, St. Cloud and nearby communities in Stearns County provide the setting for a counternarrative to the story of industrial America's protracted decline. Walloped by the forces that hit every old manufacturing enclave -- from globalization and automation to a rising demand for skills -- the area sustained its prosperity through a mix of the right investments, favorable geography and sheer serendipity.

Since 1970, manufacturers in the county have added 5,000 jobs, for a total of 11,600. Total employment has tripled, to 90,000. The population has grown by more than half. And the median income of the county's households rose 20 percent from 1980 to 2016, after inflation, to $57,728 -- a smidgen above the national median. ""When Electrolux announced it was leaving, other employers were saying, 'When can we get at that labor?'"" said King Banaian, dean of the School of Public Affairs at St. Cloud State University. ""There's a tug of war going on, and workers are getting higher wages and performance incentives and bonuses and so on."" The problem is that there are too few places like St. Cloud: Grand Rapids in Michigan's Kent County, where employment more than doubled since 1970; Green Bay in Brown County, Wis., where it almost tripled. Formerly vibrant industrial cities across the Midwest and Northeast today present a landscape of high unemployment and opioid addiction -- stagnant communities of old-timers in the shadow of rusting industrial hulks, angry at a political system that has ignored them and at an economy that has left them behind. Can they learn anything from places like Stearns County? Its experience may offer some tips for its struggling peers: Smart industrial zoning can give an edge to local companies; higher-education institutions can serve as anchors for economic development. But its most salient advantages come from its location and industrial mix, more to do with serendipity than policy. A lot of it, Mr. Banaian told me, may have been ""plain darn good luck.""

Using the mix of industries in each county, they projected how many jobs it would have today if employment in each industry had grown at the same pace as in the nation as a whole. Seventy of the original 185 had significantly fewer jobs in 2016 than they would have had if they had followed the national trend. The other 115 almost matched or outpaced the national trend. This is an imperfect measure of success. In many successful counties that experienced employment growth, workers nonetheless suffered lower wages and declining living standards. Still, on the whole these places did much better in terms of productivity and household income growth, too.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Unfortunately for the laggards, their edge may be difficult to replicate. The picture in the South and the West is brighter. Fifty-five of the 63 urban industrial counties that Mr. Berube and Ms. Murray counted in the South in 1970, as well as all 24 of those in the West, saw jobs growth that was at least about on par with the national trend over the next 46 years. But their experience is of limited use to the North and the East. In 1970, these counties were smaller and younger. They were building an industrial base as the nation's economic footprint was shifting from manufacturing to service, embracing technology and globalization. Desegregation in the South and immigration in the West added a pool of productive workers, while investment flowed in to take advantage of their cheaper labor force and the virtual absence of unions. ""Jobs were leaving Michigan, Indiana and Ohio and going to Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee,"" Mr. Berube observed. In the more successful industrial counties, construction employment doubled, on average, from 1970 to 2016, as they absorbed new populations. The old industrial cities that developed around the Great Lakes in the first half of the 20th century have a different story. Population shrank on average. Construction employment did not grow. Only six of the 35 urban industrial counties scattered across the Northeast in 1970 held their own or gained employment compared with the national trend over the next 46 years. Of 63 urban industrial cities in the Midwest in 1970, only 30 managed the feat.

Macon County, Ill. -- home of Decatur, ""the pride of the prairie""-- was an agribusiness hub and steel town that also housed mammoth production facilities for the likes of Caterpillar and Firestone Tire and Rubber. But it lost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs from 1970 to 2016. Total jobs grew by less than half a percent over 46 years. Employment in Racine, Wis., increased by 40 percent in that period. But had job growth followed national patterns it would have grown at twice that pace. Median household incomes fell a whopping 14 percent. These older industrial cities that had helped build the American middle class were by 1970 riven by conflicts between management and labor, between cities and suburbs, and between blacks and whites. ""The tension from segregation in the Midwest and North was a bigger deal,"" Mr. Berube told me.

On top of all that, their old, heavy industries were particularly vulnerable. For instance, 17 of the 22 counties in the Northeast and Midwest where steel accounted for a disproportionate share of jobs in 1970 stumbled on their way to the present. Can Decatur or Racine learn from Green Bay, Grand Rapids or St. Cloud? Perhaps the best example to follow would be to invest in education. Places with better-educated workers were generally the ones that managed the economic transformation of the last 50 years more successfully. In 1980, 18.5 percent of adults over 25 in these counties had at least a bachelor's degree, compared with only 15.1 percent in the counties that stumbled. For Midwestern states like Illinois, Wisconsin and Missouri, which are starving many of their public universities of funds, the takeaway would be: Stop. Mr. Berube and Ms. Murray's analysis, like other research before it, also suggests that policies that reduce racial or economic segregation might add to economic growth. Smart industrial development policies can help, too.

Mr. Banaian noted how St. Cloud was smart to develop industrial parks along the transportation arteries connecting it to the rest of the country. Raw money may help, too. Electrolux is decamping to South Carolina from St. Cloud thanks, in part, to a tax incentive worth $73 million over 32 years, according to a state estimate cited by the company. Research by Enrico Moretti of the University of California, Berkeley, and Michael Greenstone of the University of Chicago suggests that for all policymakers' gripes about government subsidies to corporate investment, they can yield a high return to the local economy. In the end, a lot comes down to luck. St. Cloud isn't just on the Mississippi. It is on Interstate 94, U.S. 10 and the BNSF Railway -- putting it within reach of many markets. What's more, it produces things like trailers, buses and snowmobile engines, which for some reason are not China's or Mexico's forte. Its service industries -- a growing part of its economic base -- thrive off the underserved rural towns in the western half of the state. Its medical center alone employs 10,000 people. If the successful industrial counties of the Midwest have a lesson for their less successful peers, it must be that they can't stop evolving. ""It is hard for communities to become something else,"" Mr. Berube said. That is precisely what declining industrial cities are being repeatedly called to do. And there is nothing to say that communities that successfully transformed themselves over the past 50 years will succeed again. Right now, St. Cloud's main problem may be a labor shortage. But already Mr. Banaian is worried about the internet. St. Cloud has a large retail and hospitality industry. People in the western part of the state will come into town to shop and eat and perhaps stay for the weekend. The internet, however, is putting many retailers out of business. ""That part is going away,"" Mr. Banaian said.","A look at industrial centers of the North and the East over decades of decline finds that investments, geography and sheer serendipity make a difference.",0fd55644-5a37-5bb7-867b-d72e84ba7dde,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/02/business/02PORTERprint1/02PORTER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=def24988badb19d19180212ca1488d105a9027fb45ad5b46bb05751ce1b5b3dc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"St. Cloud, Minn., continued to be a job creator over the last few decades, sustaining its prosperity while many urban industrial areas withered.

Movies,"Review: In 'Western,' German Workers Fan Tensions in a Bulgarian Town",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/movies/western-film-review-valeska-grisebach.html,"The title of Valeska Grisebach's beautifully complicated, rigorously straightforward third feature, ""Western,"" has at least two meanings. The German workers who come to a remote rural valley in Bulgaria to build a hydroelectric plant are emissaries of the West, bringing the ambiguous benefits of capitalist development to a former Eastern Bloc nation. It's not the first time Germans have been here, as several people point out, even if the crew hardly resembles an occupying army. But they do call to mind the cavalrymen in a movie like ""Fort Apache"": interlopers in someone else's territory, surrounded by a local population that is wary of their presence and sometimes hostile to it. The Germans live in a camp some distance from the nearest village, whose residents most of them regard with contempt. The exception is Meinhard (Meinhard Neumann), who is older than most of his colleagues and has a different work history. A haggard loner with a thousand-yard stare and a melancholy air, he claims to be a former soldier who has been in inhospitable places before. He befriends some of the Bulgarians, which spreads tension in every direction.

To stick with the ""Fort Apache"" analogy, Meinhard is like the John Wayne character, interested in the ""natives"" and respectful of their customs. His boss, Vincent (Reinhardt Wetrek), is a bit more like Henry Fonda: arrogant, incurious, convinced of his own superiority. When he harasses Vyara (Vyara Borisova), a local woman who is swimming near the German camp, he threatens to put the whole enterprise at risk. The possibility of violence buzzes in the air like insects in the summer heat.

But rather than force a situation drawn from contemporary reality into a ready-made genre box, Ms. Grisebach plays with the implications of the western and the expectations of the audience. At various points, we may think we know where the story is heading -- sometimes dreading an inevitable tragedy, sometimes embracing a promise of reconciliation or redemption -- but the film is as full of detours and switchbacks as the mountain roads its characters must negotiate. And those characters are not always who they seem to be, even to themselves. Meinhard comes across as more sensitive, more stoical and tougher than his colleagues -- more of a man, in the old gunslinger ethos -- but it's possible that he overestimates his own mastery of a complex situation. It's also possible that his displays of decency toward the villagers are motivated by selfishness as much as altruism and that he may not be the righteous nice guy they take him for.

Everything about ""Western"" may be knottier and more contradictory than it initially appears, but it also might be simpler. The friendship between Meinhard and Adrian (Syuleyman Alilov Lefitov), a local landowner and businessman, is direct and affectionate, and the actors show how intimacy can develop without a common language. Meinhard, nicknamed the ""legionnaire,"" is jokingly described as Adrian's bodyguard, and events will test the extent and intensity of his loyalty. Geopolitics and global economics are elements in the atmosphere, less themes of the movie than part of the air its inhabitants breathe. It's worth noting that Maren Ade, whose ""Toni Erdmann"" is also about a German expatriate in a Balkan country, is credited as a producer of ""Western."" (Ms. Grisebach was a script consultant on ""Toni Erdmann."") Both films combine highly specific individual narratives with sharp, critical scrutiny of the way the world is organized now -- the imbalances of power and autonomy that inevitably, though not always predictably, influence the ways people behave toward one another.

""Anything can happen in a village,"" Adrian says ruefully, as matters seem to be coming to a head. It's something of a rebuttal to Meinhard's earlier observation that the one consistent truth of the human condition is the domination of the weak by the strong. But there are different kinds of strength, and there are also other factors at work, including laziness, whim, habit and random chance.

Dance,"Come Here, Look Back, Move Forward",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/06/arts/dance/stephen-petronio-company-marks-its-30th-anniversary.html,"The choreographer Stephen Petronio does not like to go backward. He says that moving in reverse -- say, on a train -- makes him feel mentally disturbed and physically ill. Nevertheless, there is a lot of backward in his life these days. At 58, he has written a memoir. A lovingly rendered account of an Italian-American childhood in suburban New Jersey, it is the story of a bookish boy not quite at home in that world. In college, he discovers improvisational dance. He becomes the first man to join the dance company of Trisha Brown. He founds his own troupe and develops a movement language, an unmistakable style: breakneck, baroque and erotic. ""I think of myself,"" he writes, ""as a formalist with a dirty mind."" The memoir is packed with sex and drugs and celebrities; the pages are peppered with literally boldface names. Mr. Petronio becomes a father. He gets married to two women and twice to one man. He makes many dances. By the end, he's gone clean and sober, but one habit remains unkicked. The title of the book is ""Confessions of a Motion Addict."" On Tuesday at the Joyce Theater in Manhattan, his company begins its 30th anniversary season. Since 2012, Mr. Petronio has been the Joyce's first artist in residence. Interviewed in the studio and office that come with that position (along with a salary), he spoke with both mortification and pride of having lasted this long.

There's only one older work on the program: ""Strange Attractors (Part I),"" a piece from 1999 that's typical Petronio in its tension between chaos and order but unusual in its romantic stretch. The two other selections are new and forward looking -- except that both draw on memory, and one is all about traveling in reverse. Since the 1980s his company has specialized in the headlong motion he calls ""dipping into the future."" But in his new ""Locomotor,"" the dancers hurl themselves backward -- fast. The effect is like high-speed rewind, and the thrill of watching it includes fear. It was frightening for the dancers to learn, Mr. Petronio said, demanding novel skills of orientation on the fly. In a recent rehearsal, the guest artist Melissa Toogood, a former Merce Cunningham dancer trained to do anything, asked, ""How is that possible?"" The direction of travel isn't the only backward element. Inspired by the theory that backward motion stimulates reminiscence, Mr. Petronio has studded ""Locomotor"" with bits of past dances and evocations of former company members, the ghosts he always sees in the movements he developed with those dancers. ""It's like a dream I had when I was a child,"" he said of his concept. ""I'm in my neighborhood, looking for my house, but everything's slightly rearranged.""

""I don't know if it was the saline dripping into me,"" Mr. Petronio remembered, ""but for the first time in my career I danced with zero pain."" He added, ""So that's my new secret."" ""Stripped"" doesn't involve open veins, at least not physically. Set to Philip Glass's Etude No. 5, the solo is itself a kind of practice piece. Mr. Petronio loads himself with 30 gestures, as well as a series of emotional states, some recalled from his youth, and with these materials, he enacts his choreographic process onstage. For ""Stripped,"" the artist Janine Antoni has sewn a collection of men's ties end to end. This ""costumed intervention,"" wrapped around Mr. Petronio's head, links with the Petronian theme of identity and surface, but Ms. Antoni's interventions go beyond costume design. Mr. Petronio is an inveterate collaborator. ""Locomotor"" features a score by the rising hip-hop producer Clams Casino, who happens to be his cousin. Many of the boldface names in his memoir belong to the musicians, fashion designers and artists he's commissioned: Lou Reed, Cindy Sherman. But none of those collaborators has done what Ms. Antoni has: invited him into her world. In their first collaboration -- for Mr. Petronio's 2013 piece ""Like Lazarus Did"" -- Ms. Antoni performed as a living sculpture. Her suggestion that the stage be covered in honey for the work's final solo, an evocation of birth, was theatrically impractical. But she and Mr. Petronio have since pursued the idea in a video, exhibited with her installations, called ""Honey Baby."" In the process, they blurred the roles of choreographer and visual artist, and for subsequent performances and objects, those roles have stayed blurred.

As a choreographer, Mr. Petronio said, he has always envied visual artists for the permanence of the things they make. His creative involvement with Ms. Antoni gives him a taste of that permanence, but also, and even more important, something else. Five or so years ago, he looked at the movement language he had created -- a rare achievement in dance -- and thought, ""Now what?"" He and Ms. Antoni shake each other up. One thing that hasn't changed is his belief in having a dance company. ""It is seen as passe,"" he said, ""because the financial structures that supported companies are disappearing. But there were companies before there was a structure to support them. The structure got built around the artistic need, the depth of research possible with a family of dancers."" Although in the early years Mr. Petronio's troupe earned 90 percent of its income performing, it has had to adjust to new circumstances, and just before the Joyce selected him as artist in residence, he was considering closing up shop. For now, his company survives. The death of Cunningham and the retirement of Ms. Brown have prompted thoughts of the future. What if his legacy were a physical place, where others might have time to create movement? There is no place yet, and he is not yet done, but getting ahead of himself is Mr. Petronio's style.","On Tuesday at the Joyce Theater, Stephen Petronio Company begins its 30th anniversary season.",397e6e11-bdf8-55b0-b6df-7e68d23d2863,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/06/arts/06PETRONIO1_SPAN/06PETRONIO1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=1c2beeed9ea9bf177f330dec32eff935607a50d8b884c8ae2bd0b9236ba47d8b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Stephen Petronio, left, and the hip-hop producer Clams Casino, who has contributed a score for ""Locomotor,"" a new work choreographed by Mr. Petronio.",397e6e11-bdf8-55b0-b6df-7e68d23d2863,N24News/imgs/397e6e11-bdf8-55b0-b6df-7e68d23d2863.jpg,6
Global Business,Bulgari Family Tries to Become a Name in Wine,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/24/business/global/bulgari-family-tries-to-make-a-switch-to-wine-from-jewelry.html,"PALAZZONE, Italy -- The Bulgari name has long been associated with luxury jewelry worn by some of the most famous celebrities in the world, like Elizabeth Taylor and Julianne Moore. But will it mean anything in the world of fine wine? The Bulgari family does not know, but this week it will begin to find out. A new wine venture by two members of the Bulgari watch and jewelry dynasty, Paolo and Giovanni Bulgari, will release its first three wines this weekend at Vinitaly, the international wine trade fair in Verona, Italy. The wines, made at the family's PoderNuovo estate here in southern Tuscany, are the first fruits of the enterprise established by the former chairman of the Bulgari Group, Paolo Bulgari, and his son since the family sold control of the jewelry company through a share swap with the French luxury company LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton in March 2011. It is difficult to make a splash in the world of fine wine. It is very competitive and has plenty of venerable boutique brands like Tignanello, produced by Antinori, or Tenuta San Guido's Sassicaia wines. But that has not stopped many celebrities, like the golfer Greg Norman and the actress Drew Barrymore, from entering the business.

The Bulgaris are playing down the family pedigree on the bottle, in part because of rules set by their former company that restrict how the Bulgari name can be used in other businesses. The PoderNuovo label is a simple design of blood-red stylized vineyards on a white background, with Paolo and Giovanni Bulgaris' names in discreet light gray characters below. Of the three wines, only Sotirio, named after the Greek-born founder of the Bulgari dynasty, is a direct nod to the family's illustrious past. ""Our first battle is not to be known as the Bulgari wine,"" said Giovanni Bulgari, 36, chief executive of PoderNuovo, during an interview in the cozy dining area of the farmhouse that is now his part-time home. He said he and his father were worried that the wine would be seen as a rich man's lark or an agricultural offshoot of Bulgari's better known jewels, watches, perfumes or other accessories. ""The real challenge is to show that we can produce good wine very well,"" he said. That is not to say that handling jewels for years has not affected how Mr. Bulgari approaches winemaking. ""My father taught me how to handle stones, to hold them in my hands without looking at them to get a sense of their temperature, and then to observe how light plays off them,"" he said. Wine also called for an intuitive perspective: ""how it reacts to light, how the color moves in a glass.""

So far, luck and nature have been on their side, Mr. Bulgari said. The 42 acres of vineyards at PoderNuovo were planted in 2007. Their terrain is rich with clay, sand and chalk in differing proportions, a good match for different varieties of grapes. The Bulgaris also turned to one of Italy's best-known oenologists, Riccardo Cotarella, to put his stamp on the three vintage 2009 wines going on the market: a Tuscan red blend, a cabernet franc and a Sangiovese, the indigenous grape of central Italy.

Initial production is set for 60,000 bottles, with a goal of doubling that when the vineyard is fully operational. The wines will sell wholesale for 12, 16 or 20 euros (roughly $16, $21 or $24), depending on the wine. Importers and distributors will set the retail price. The family is under no illusion that past successes in one field will guarantee success in another. ""It's a very crowded marketplace, and it's a difficult moment to sell anything from wine to cars. The competition is so tough,"" acknowledged Paolo Bulgari, who nevertheless described himself as optimistic. ""Now we're going to have to get out there to sell.""
* Today in On Tech: Imagine not living in Big Tech's world.
* Dollar Tree will raise prices to $1.25 by the end of April. The family still has to line up its distributors and importers, although it could have a leg up in landing LVMH, which sells niche wines, Champagnes and spirits and where Paolo Bulgari sits on the board. ""Over all, the international market has room for growth for those who offer good products, with good value for the money,"" said Andrea Rea, who oversees the Wine Marketing Observatory at Bocconi University in Milan. He added, however, that the wine market was undergoing a ""bottleneck effect at the distribution level"" that made it more difficult for wines to be exported, especially from a crowded market like Italy. Start-up companies face the greatest difficulty, and those aiming to grab a share of the high-end market may find the economic barriers especially high, Mr. Rea said. ""There's no easy way anymore,"" said John Gillespie, a partner in Wine Colleagues, a wine business consultancy based in St. Helena, Calif., who said the wine market was glutted with celebrity offerings. ""It seems like every golfer, every aging rock star has their own wine. Even popular nighttime dramas are considering launching their brand.""

The Bulgari pedigree could be an advantage if the PoderNuovo wine becomes clearly associated with the luxury brand. ""It would depend on who the wine is intended for. When I say Bulgari, for some women who I know, a light goes on and they'd say, yeah I am interested in that,"" he said. The Bulgaris join other famous families from the world of luxury brands, like the Cavallis and the Ferragamos, in trying to produce wine. When Tommaso Cavalli, the son of the designer Roberto Cavalli, began to sell wine in 2004, the bottles were marked with the fashion brand's recognizable stamp. But Mr. Cavalli always intended to impress wine connoisseurs, not fashion devotees, he said. The labels of recent vintages have no overt links to the fashion brand, although Roberto Cavalli designed the new logo. ""I know I have an important name backing me, but this vineyard is my doing,"" Tommaso Cavalli said in a telephone interview. ""The culturally conservative wine world tends to be diffident in the face of a name that is successful in other sectors. My hope is that over time that world will recognize the authenticity of our project."" At the Bulgari property on a recent morning, construction was under way on a high-tech wine cellar. Giovanni Bulgari deflected questions about the size of the investment in the wine venture, saying only that in general, investments in wines tend not to pay off for some time.","Two members of the Bulgari watch and jewelry family will release their first three wines this weekend at a trade fair in Verona, Italy.",a48b1d33-8b91-5bd5-a8bf-59611a8bddd8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/03/24/business/global/24bulgari-inline/24bulgari-inline-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2012&h=330&w=600&s=11dec52ce7b0015444c1d75aec395f857113be88a1079cc6334f166274d69305&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Giovanni Bulgari in the Tuscan vineyard owned by his family.

Sports,A Return for Baseball Would Require a New Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/18/sports/baseball/coronavirus-baseball.html,"Everybody wants a baseball season. Nobody knows quite how that will look amid the coronavirus pandemic. Those are the only certainties for a sport that has an unbroken chain of seasons with at least 100 games stretching back to the 19th century. But as more and more hopeful hints have emerged this week -- from Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's leading expert on infectious diseases, and from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, who both publicly touted the feasibility of playing in empty ballparks -- a distressing backdrop still looms: If teams cannot sell tickets, how much will the players be paid? ""The issue over pay without fans is going to get ugly,"" said a top baseball official of one team, who insisted on anonymity to speak candidly about league matters. ""It's very real. Owners will claim they'd lose money by playing without fans if players get their full per-game salaries, and it may be true. They're going to want a big reduction in pay from players."" When Major League Baseball and the players' union agreed on new ground rules for the delayed season on March 26 -- the original opening day -- they included a stipulation that the sides would ""discuss in good faith the economic feasibility of playing games in the absence of spectators or at appropriate substitute neutral sites.""

For the owners, that set up another negotiation on pay structure, in an altered economic landscape. The players' side has a different interpretation of ""economic feasibility,"" according to the agent Scott Boras.
* None
* Everyone Loves Ohtani: The Angels' two-way star was a unanimous pick for A.L. M.V.P. and his superfans redefine devotion.
* Phillie Phavorite: Bryce Harper truly committed to Philadelphia and now he's back on top of baseball, winning the N.L. M.V.P.
* Cy Young Winners: Milwaukee's Corbin Burnes and Toronto's Robbie Ray had hit rock bottom before they worked their way up to stardom.
* Baseball Is Stuck in Neutral: The potential of a lockout has a star-studded group of free agents waiting for the dust to settle.
* Free-Agency Tracker: Get the latest updates on signings, contract extensions and trades. ""The economics they're talking about is whether they play or not, not what they pay the players to play,"" said Boras, adding: ""Owners had every opportunity to say, 'We will also reduce the rate of your salaries if these conditions exist.' They didn't, and the reason they wouldn't is because players would never accept it; they would never agree to the deal."" The issue spilled into the public discourse on Wednesday when Cuomo told his brother, Chris, on CNN that he had spoken with the Mets' chief operating officer, Jeff Wilpon, about playing games without fans, and that Wilpon had mentioned an obstacle. ""Apparently Major League Baseball would have to make a deal with the players, because if you have no one in the stands, then the numbers are going to change, right?"" Governor Cuomo said. ""The economics are going to change."" Wilpon declined to comment through a spokesman, but M.L.B. supported him with a statement that said, ""Both parties understood that the deal was premised on playing in stadiums with fans, and the agreement makes that clear.""

In a way, this would be a welcome fight, because in order to have it, baseball would need a clear path to returning. That does not yet exist, and it depends largely on the availability of tests, the spread of the coronavirus and authorization from state and local governments.

As things stand, M.L.B. and the union have had no further discussions on the pay structure of a shortened season, because there are too many variables about the conditions. But the strong feeling from the union is that teams would be obligated to pay the players their regular salaries, prorated to reflect the number of games played. The players have already waived any potential legal claims over additional salary -- beyond an initial distribution of $170 million -- in the event a season is not played. They made that concession in exchange for a guarantee of service time for a lost season. But multiple union officials privately dispute the idea that teams would not profit without fans in the stands unless the players take a pay cut. The teams would make less money, to be sure, but they would also have television revenue coming in, and a reduction in expenses related to staging games with fans. And if a regular season is played, a lucrative postseason -- the prize for national networks -- would follow. The league estimates that teams get about 40 percent of their revenue from ticketing, parking, concessions and other elements of having fans in attendance -- all of which would be lost if games have no spectators. Officials are already bracing for the economic impact, with teams poised to furlough or cut pay for salaried employees by the end of the month, when M.L.B. is expected to suspend the uniform employee contract, citing a national emergency. Then again, if the game returns, some ballparks may not need to stay empty all season, which would mean another set of complications. What if one state does not authorize mass gatherings, but other states do? How would the sides account for reduced crowds, or having fans only in certain places? And how many fans would come to see, say, the Detroit Tigers play the Baltimore Orioles if the game were held in another city?","On the bright side, if M.L.B. and the players' union need to fight over the details about a return to play, it would mean such a return is possible.",989ec154-bf15-54c4-bcee-19cf5b2c66d1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/19/sports/19virus-kepner-Print/19virus-kepner-Print-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=d020761c111f0d2174858ea81fde72cfee30554b439f173daf22ecd6f475b402&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The White Sox park on what would have been opening day in Chicago.

Style,How to Run a Business in 2020,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/style/millennial-entrepreneur-startups.html,"Credit...George Etheredge for The New York Times



In recent years, stars have lent their names to all kinds of sneaker collaborations. Puma had Rihanna. Reebok had Gigi Hadid. Adidas had Kanye West. Nike had ... Jesus Christ? Not exactly. In October, a pair of ""Jesus shoes"" -- customized Air Max 97s whose soles contained holy water from the River Jordan -- appeared online for $1,425. They were designed by a start-up called MSCHF, without Nike's blessing. The sneakers quickly sold out and began appearing on resale sites, going for as much as $4,000. The Christian Post wrote about them. Drake wore them. They were among the most Googled shoes of 2019. The only thing that didn't happen, said Kevin Wiesner, 27, a creative director at MSCHF, was a public disavowal of the shoes by Nike or the Vatican. ""That would've been rad,"" he said.

Now, in the MSCHF office in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, a pair stands like a trophy. MSCHF isn't a sneaker company. It rarely even produces commercial goods, and its employees are reluctant to call it a company at all. They refer to MSCHF, which was founded in 2016, as a ""brand,"" ""group"" or ""collective,"" and their creations, which appear online every two weeks, as ""drops."" Many of those drops are viral pranks: an app that recommends stocks to buy based on one's astrological sign (which some observers took seriously), a service that sends pictures of A.I.-generated feet over text, a browser extension that helps users get away with watching Netflix at work. As Business Insider recently noted, the present and future profitability of these internet stunts is dubious. Yet, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, MSCHF has raised at least $11.5 million in outside investments since the fall of 2019.

""Sometimes investors are a little too serious about monetizing something immediately,"" Ms. Singareddy said. ""With MSCHF, there's faith that it'll pay off. There's an inherent virality and absurdness to all the projects that they've created, and it's something people want to share and ask questions about."" For starters: What is it? 'This Is How We Live' The MSCHF office says as much about the company as any of its products. A giant white pentagram covers the entrance floor. On a visit in December, an inflatable severed swan's head dangled from a ceiling beam, and a rubber chicken bong -- a recent drop -- sat on a coffee table, full of weed. ""My mom thinks we make toys,"" said Gabriel Whaley, 30, the chief executive.

MSCHF has 10 employees, nine of whom are men. The company Twitter and Instagram pages are private, so most of its direct marketing takes place not on social media but through text messages from a mysterious phone number. Though the team used to run a marketing agency, working with brands like Casper in order to fund MSCHF projects, they stopped taking on clients last year. Now, they pretty much do whatever they want. ""The cool thing that we have going for us is we set this precedent that we're not tied to a category or vertical. We did the Jesus shoes and everyone knows us for that, and then we shut it down,"" Mr. Whaley said. ""We will never do it again. People are like, 'Wait, why wouldn't you double down on that, you would have made so much money!' But that's not why we're here.""

The point, he said, is to produce social commentary; the ""story"" the sneakers told was more important than turning a profit. ""There are several youth pastors that have bought a pair, and even more who are asking, like, 'I love sneakers, and I love God. I would love a pair of these,' and that wasn't the point,"" Mr. Whaley said. ""The Jesus shoes were a platform to broach the idea while also making fun of it: that everybody's just doing a collaboration now."" In order to prepare each drop -- be it an object, an app or a website -- MSCHF's employees log long hours. Most mornings, Mr. Whaley gets to the office around 7; the rest of the team arrives by 10. They often stay late into the evenings, conducting brainstorms, perfecting lines of code, shooting live-streams or assembling prototypes. Weekends, Mr. Whaley said, aren't really a thing. ""It's not just a full-time job,"" he said. ""This is how we live. The distinction between your work and normal life doesn't really exist here, and it's just because this is what we were all doing whether we were getting paid or not in our former lives. So nothing has really changed, except we have more power as a unit than we did as individuals.""

Some C.E.O.s of Fortune 500 companies have tried to mentor Mr. Whaley and ""shoehorn"" MSCHF into a traditional business, he said. They insist MSCHF is building a brand, that it needs a logo, a mission, a go-to product that people recognize. But MSCHF doesn't have a flagship product, or market its releases traditionally. ""It just happens that anything we make tends to spread purely because people end up talking about it and sharing it with their friends,"" Mr. Whaley said. That's part of the appeal for V.C. firms. With software companies, for example, there are ""very clear metrics and paths to monetization that are tried and true,"" Ms. Singareddy said. For MSCHF, that path is less obvious. ""Some of the best investments, even early on it wasn't clear what the result would be, but you're making an investment in the team,"" she said. ""That's what makes a company like MSCHF so exciting. Venture is about taking reasoned risk -- it's a true venture capital opportunity."" Mr. Whaley talks a lot about what MSCHF is and who the people who work there are -- and aren't. Running ads on subways, or trying to build a social media following, or landing a spot on the Forbes ""30 Under 30"" list isn't who they are. He cringes at the word ""merch."" (""The day we sell hoodies is the day I shut this down."") To observers, critics and followers, the company's portfolio may amount to a very successful string of viral marketing campaigns, a series of jokes or something like art.

On Twitter and Reddit, users trade theories and tips about MSCHF's more cryptic offerings, such as its most recent, password-protected drop, Zuckwatch -- a website that looks like Facebook and appears to be commentary on data privacy. Among these ardent fans, the drops are treated as trailheads, or entry points, setting off mad, winding dashes in search of cracking the code. Other followers, less devoted, may only know MSCHF for its Jesus shoes, which Mr. Wiesner said have been knocked off by sellers around the world. He is happy about it. ""If we can make things that people run away with, that's absolutely the dream,"" he said. ""Most of what we make is us personally running away with stuff."" Ahead of the presidential election, MSCHF's employees plan to take on more political projects. (A drop in November, involving a shell restaurant, enabled users to mask political donations as work expenses; it was promptly shut down.) The company also hopes to expand beyond apps and objects to experiences and physical spaces. ""Everything is just, 'How do we kind of make fun of what we're observing?'"" Mr. Whaley said. ""Then we have as much fun with it as possible and see what happens.""","Gabriel Whaley and his colleagues do whatever they want all day.

Style,"In the Time of Trump, a Horror-Movie Maker Rules Hollywood",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/style/jason-blum-get-out-happy-death-day-white-house-donald-trump.html,"WASHINGTON, D.C. -- I wanted to meet Jason Blum, the king of low-budget horror movies, at the scariest place on earth so that we could talk about Halloween, our favorite holiday, and what frightens us. We thought about going to the Hitchcock grave in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery until we discovered it was the wrong Hitchcock. We mulled sitting on the front porch of the Doyle House in Hollywood, where Jamie Lee Curtis had the worst babysitting gig in history in the original ""Halloween."" But in the end, Mr. Blum decided that the most chilling place on the planet was a home right down the block from my office that many see as haunted by a bloated, wailing orange apparition.

""I think the biggest threats to humanity come from this house right here and the people inside,"" he says, as we stand outside the White House on a balmy October night that fortuitously happened to be Friday the 13th. Mr. Blum, a 48-year-old Hollywood producer, takes this stand even though he thinks that goose bumps about Donald J. Trump have buoyed Blumhouse, his hit factory that has made ""Get Out,"" ""Sinister,"" ""Insidious,"" ""The Purge,"" ""Paranormal Activity,"" ""Split,"" ""The Gift"" and ""The Visit."" Blumhouse also produced the Oscar-winning ""Whiplash"" and won Emmys for ""The Normal Heart"" and ""The Jinx,"" the eerie six-part documentary about Robert Durst that ended with him caught on a hot microphone whispering to himself in a bathroom about his dead wife and dead best friend: ""What the hell did I do? Killed them all of course."" Mr. Blum is now teaming with John Carpenter for the final ""Halloween"" with Ms. Curtis returning as Laurie Strode. In the time Mr. Blum and I were having dinner, his latest, ""Happy Death Day,"" a ghoulish twist on ""Groundhog Day,"" leapt to No. 1 at the weekend box office.

""I think when people are scared, they like to see movies where the scares are not real,"" Mr. Blum says. ""The current administration's been terrific for the scary-movie business. It's been our best year ever. I think 'Get Out' did four times the business it would have done if Hillary had been president."" Mr. Blum frets about the White House swallowing his former communications chief, Josh Raffel, who left him to become Jared Kushner's lieutenant, much like the hero of ""Get Out"" is swallowed by ""the sunken place."" He jokes that he wants to rescue Mr. Raffel from the ""cult"" because ""I'm scared Jared is drinking his blood."" Christopher Landon, the director of ""Happy Death Day,"" agrees that President Trump ""has stirred up all these dark places and dark corners and old shadows of our culture, and horror is so well suited to address these things."" While Hollywood is in atrophy, endlessly and tediously replicating comic-book franchises, Mr. Blum is able to be original and risky by staying fast and cheap. And once he got successful, he did not jump to blockbusters. ""He has created a business model that works, making films for $5 million or less with clear commerciality and marketability,"" says Donna Langley, chairwoman of Universal Pictures, who signed Mr. Blum to a 10-year, first-look film deal. ""He's excitable and exciting to be around.""

In a fear-based business, Mr. Blum sprinkles pixie dust, making filmmakers' dreams come true -- on a budget. Mr. Landon calls Mr. Blum ""a cross between Willy Wonka and Robert Evans. He has this sort of mad-professor vibe but an old-school charm as well, an energy fluttering about him that is hard to contain."" Dressed in khaki pants and a blue vest from Zara and wearing a 1987 Rolex, Mr. Blum pulls out his phone to show me some of his old Halloween costumes where he is dressed as a female character. ""My mother always said I should have been born a woman,"" he says, laughing. ""I have good legs."" Last year, he was a convincing Wicked Witch of the West and his wife, Lauren Schuker, was Dorothy. Ms. Schuker is a former Wall Street Journal reporter who is co-writing a movie about Gamergate for Amy Pascal's production company. They have a 2-year-old daughter. This year, Mr. Blum was Ivanka, in her famous pink sheath dress, and Ms. Schuker was Iraq Jared in his flak jacket. They accessorized with buttons reading: ""America's Scariest Couple."" Mr. Blum loves to troll Ivanka and her ""daddy."" When Ivanka tweeted a FEMA update about the California wildfires, Mr. Blum retweeted her, noting dryly: ""It's fun to play government."" When she tweeted on empowering and investing in women, Mr. Blum retweeted with this acidic comment: ""But don't give them birth control. You are a gross opportunist.""

I ask him about the PC crackdown on costumes. Universities now issue guidelines and hold ""social justice"" workshops about how to avoid ""cultural appropriation."" A list of instructions circulating on Twitter read: ""How to Not Be a Jerk This Halloween: No problematic historical figures; Don't glorify violence against women; Cultures are not costumes (absolutely no blackface, brownface, yellowface; absolutely no religious garb (i.e. hijabs, bindis, etc.); absolutely no native headdresses; absolutely no gypsy-related costumes); Gender identity is not a costume (don't dress trans if you're not trans); Sexual identity is not a costume (don't dress as a gay figure if you're not gay.)"" Mr. Blum observes simply: ""Halloween is woke, and there's nothing we can do about it."" Over a mango lassi at the Bombay Club, he explains how he drove his customized van that doubles as an office down the road to inheriting the mantle of Val Lewton and Roger Corman as a master of shadows. ""My favorite thing about horror is that it attracts this great group of nuts, of which I include myself in,"" Mr. Blum says. ""I was always kind of an oddball. I collected my fingernails, for instance. ""Halloween was definitely the biggest holiday when I was a kid. We started making our Halloween costumes in August. Me and my mom. My mom was a single mom, it was just her and I."" He grew up in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. He was 4 years old when his parents got divorced. His mother, Shirley, was an art history professor at SUNY Purchase, and his father was Irving Blum, an art dealer in Los Angeles who was the first to show Warhol's soup cans.

At Vassar College, Mr. Blum took a course on Hitchcock, which hooked him. His roommate was the future director Noah Baumbach. ""We were best friends,"" Mr. Blum says. ""When I graduated college, I moved to Chicago and I was roommates with Noah. We lived in this little one-bedroom apartment. I sold cable TV door to door. Noah wrote 'Kicking and Screaming,' and we decided together we were going to get that movie made."" They moved to New York and Mr. Blum got his real-estate license. His father gave the script to one of his clients, Steve Martin, who let the would-be filmmakers use his letter praising it to shop it around. But after Mr. Blum helped get the movie up and running, he says, his friend cut him out. ""Noah got what he needed from me and moved on,"" he says. I ask about his five-year stint from 1995 to 2000 working for Harvey Weinstein in Mr. Weinstein's film acquisition unit. Looking pained, Mr. Blum says he is ""reprogramming"" Mr. Weinstein to a different place in his brain and that he knew his boss was dark, just not that dark.

""Before all this, we heard the story, 'Oh, he was in his hotel room, he was with an actress. He touched her on the leg or did something he shouldn't have done. He's a bully. She left. She threatened to sue him and rather than go through litigation, he gave her 100,000 bucks.' And the settlements were described as 'People are taking advantage of me because I'm rich.' ""That's what we all thought, like, 'Yeah, he's gross, Harvey's being a scumbag again' -- not, 'He was a rapist.' I was in his hotel room when he was in his robe. He was in his robe all the time when we were traveling at film festivals. He worked 24 hours a day and he was always in his robe."" When Mr. Blum lost the distribution rights to ""Run Lola Run"" in a Toronto negotiation, after Mr. Weinstein changed the terms at the last minute, Mr. Weinstein ordered Mr. Blum to run over to the hotel of the rights holders and stay there until they changed their minds. ""I'm 28 years old,"" Mr. Blum recalls. ""I'm bawling. It's 3:30 a.m. I'm knocking on the guy's door, begging him to open the door. And crying. I'm crying, I'm crying. He won't open the door."" Mr. Weinstein rushed up to Toronto and they went into one of the multiple hotel suites his boss always kept -- ""there were always endless hotel rooms,"" Mr. Blum says -- and Mr. Weinstein threw his lit cigarette. ""And the lit cigarette hit me,"" Mr. Blum continues. ""It bounced off me and bounced on the floor and Harvey knew he shouldn't have done it and he said, 'I was going for the garbage can.' And I was so upset at the other side, and attracted to being abused, that I was fully on Harvey's side. I was like, 'Harvey, don't worry about it. I'm so mad, too. I can't believe what they did to us.' ""Oh my God, it was total Stockholm syndrome. He bullied me, he threw a lit cigarette at me. And I tried to hide that it happened, trying to protect him. I mean, it was very, very abusive. When he called, you would go into a sweat. Every time he called, I was terrified. And wherever I was, from the time I was under that contract, I was never free. I went into cognitive therapy after I was there 12 months, because I had depression.""

The therapist gave him a self-help book called ""The Assertive Option,"" which he began using in interactions with the Weinstein brothers, who ""were so brutal that everyone else banded together and protected each other against these guys. They weren't Cain and Abel, because they were both awful. But they also hated each other."" He said he is struggling ""to figure out why I chose to stay in a place for years where I was abused. He didn't force me to stay there. I could have quit at any time. Why didn't I quit?"" He agreed with a former colleague at the company who told him recently: ""I wish I could go to the hospital and get the part where Harvey existed in my brain taken out of my brain."" He did learn a lot from Mr. Weinstein, he says, including the frenetic pace and the never-give-up attitude. But in other ways, he has modeled his company to be the reverse of that one. He never micromanages. ""Harvey would spend days arguing over a part that was three days long,"" Mr. Blum says. ""I don't know who plays those parts. It's such a waste of time. We give a ton of creative input, but I don't spend 700 years arguing over something like Nicole Kidman's nose in 'The Hours.' ""Harvey would say 'I'm the best editor in Hollywood.' He didn't look at his job as supporting the artists. He looked at himself as an artist. And I look at myself as a curator, blowing a path through to let the artist do their thing. I would be terrible at directing a movie. I don't have that kind of brain."" Because of his parents, Mr. Blum understands how to talk to artists, but he also gets the needs of the business side.

He has always made it a practice not to meet with actresses alone. ""I just don't want to be in my office alone with an actress. It might be because of Harvey, because I'm terrified the actress will walk out of the door and say I did something wrong. So there's no way they can do that if there's someone else in the room."" ""It's the power dynamic,"" he says. ""You get a 23-year-old actress sitting in your office, I think they feel like, do they flirt in the meeting, do they not flirt? It's just uncomfortable. It just lingers in the air. And I don't want it lingering in the air. And if my head of casting, who is a woman, is sitting there, it's fine. And I can ask for an actress's email and it's not weird. Then I send them a script directly, I don't go through their agent, and it's fine."" Before the Weinstein revelations, Mr. Blum had bought Gabriel Sherman's book on Roger Ailes to turn into a eight-part series for Showtime, the saga of ""the guy who enabled the guy,"" the Fox News chief who rolled out the red carpet to the Trump White House. Mr. Blum says the movie he would most like to do now is a remake of the 1957 Andy Griffith classic, ""A Face in the Crowd,"" about a wealthy, megalomaniacal television personality who swans about as the voice of the people until he's exposed as a phony. Jason Blum faces more of his demons in Confirm or Deny, here.","""I think 'Get Out' did four times the business it would have done if Hillary had been president,"" says Jason Blum, also producer of ""Happy Death Day.""",5b9ee55e-e2dc-55e5-a4ed-9849540fcfe7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/02/fashion/02BLUM-1/02BLUM-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=babe8e7fe6866ac467ba02121009144ffba9ba0028febfa69b619d60f5bcdbc3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The horror film producer Jason Blum outside the White House.

Well,How to (Maybe) Avoid Sticker Shock at the Emergency Room,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/well/live/emergency-room-costs-medical-bills-urgent-care-virtual-care.html,"Emergency care has always been expensive. Recently, though, a perfect storm of high-deductible insurance plans, new venues of care such as stand-alone emergency departments, and insurers who deny payment based on retrospective review -- that is, based on the patient's final diagnosis rather than the original complaint -- has elevated concerns about cost to a level that might best be described as sticker shock.

But people might be less likely to face sticker shock in the emergency room if they recognized that it isn't always the best place to go for treatment. Depending on what a patient's symptoms are, it may be worth considering other options for same-day care. In order of increasing services that can be provided, and increasing price, the options are: primary care, virtual care, retail clinics, urgent care centers, and emergency departments (E.D.s).
* None Primary care: Although it may be difficult to see a physician on short notice, primary care providers can often handle the problems of established patients by telephone at no cost.
* None Virtual care: Accessible by smartphone, tablet or computer, virtual care is available in most states and is usually the least expensive option for unscheduled care. Websites such as Doctor On Demand and UCHealth Virtual Visits are staffed by physicians or advanced practice providers and are aimed at providing treatment for simple medical problems. Virtual care is covered by most insurance. Costs are typically $40 to $80 per visit.
* None Retail clinics: For unscheduled, in-person care, retail clinics -- found in pharmacies, supermarkets and other retail locations -- are the least expensive option. They are designed to provide quick care for minor problems like sore throats. As an example, CVS Minute Clinics typically charge $99 to $129. Care is typically rendered by a nurse practitioner or physician assistant.
* None Urgent care: Urgent care centers such as Concentra and CityMD offer walk-in care for illnesses and injuries that are not life threatening. Charges for simple complaints, such as sore throats, run $150 or more. Urgent care centers may be staffed by a physician assistant, a nurse practitioner or a physician.
* None Emergency rooms: There are now three types of emergency departments: stand-alone E.D.s, mini-hospital E.D.s and traditional hospital E.D.s. All are staffed 24/7 by board-certified emergency physicians. All are able to deliver lifesaving care. And all are similarly expensive. Stand-alone E.D.s are usually the quickest and most convenient. Traditional hospital E.D.s are best equipped to handle severe emergencies, such as major trauma.

Using sore throat as an example, health insurers reimburse emergency departments at an average of $956 for a sore throat, compared with $131 at an urgent care center. While the patient's financial responsibility varies from insurer to insurer, emergency room co-payments are generally higher than they are for urgent care, and the bill will be higher than it would be at a retail clinic or urgent care center.

But cost cannot be the sole concern. Potentially serious problems require a visit to the emergency room. For example, adults with chest pain -- particularly those with a history of cigarette smoking, diabetes or other cardiac risk factors -- should be evaluated in an emergency room. Visiting one of the other venues risks turning one bill into two, as a referral to an emergency room is likely. It also risks a delay in receiving potentially lifesaving care.","Knowing whether to use an urgent care center, a retail clinic, virtual care or the emergency room can make a big difference in cost.",b3b97018-de29-503d-8228-07b02535d300,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/07/smarter-living/07emergency-room/07emergency-room-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=7222eed6b5ea12968e5f156775b95ee009131c9e310d961b26791d1ae729935f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Outside the emergency room at Cooper University Hospital in Camden, N.J.",b3b97018-de29-503d-8228-07b02535d300,N24News/imgs/b3b97018-de29-503d-8228-07b02535d300.jpg,18
Real Estate,A Cornucopia of Views,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/30/realestate/one57-in-manhattan-a-birds-eye-view-for-529-million.html,"""You're in another world up there,"" said Jeannie Woodbrey, a senior sales executive for One57, where more than 80 percent of the 94 units in the bold blue tower designed by Atelier Christian de Portzamparc are spoken for.

The Extell Marketing Group handled the sale for the sponsor. Michael Graves of Douglas Elliman Real Estate represented the unidentified buyer, who used a limited liability company, Lapus NY Inc., with a Pasadena, Calif., address.

""Unless you are deathly afraid of heights, I don't think there's anyone in the world who wouldn't love to own an apartment near the top of the tower,"" Mr. Graves said. ""Living on a full floor at One57 is probably the closest thing to being a king in the 21st century: The views are 360 degrees of absolute bliss, and there you are, front and center above it all, soaring over the park with the view of an eagle. On a clear day you can see almost every bridge in the tristate area. It's very special. My clients felt that being on the 80th floor had a nice ring to it, a good feng shui.""

Mr. Graves said the top-tier amenities provided by the new Park Hyatt New York at the base of the tower are another enticement. ""Having the hotel right there brings additional convenience to the lifestyle they already have,"" he said. ""Most of the buyers are going to do their own customizations of this product that has been so beautifully delivered by the sponsor, but one thing you can never replace or change is the location and views you get from that height.""

One other thing that the privileged few who buy entire floors at One57 are unlikely to alter is the one-ton bathtub sculpted from a single marble slab that stands sentry in every master bath: disturbing that mighty vessel could be detrimental to a unit's internal feng shui.","A full-floor apartment near the top of One57, with four bedrooms and spectacular park, river and cityscape views, is the sale of the week.",221726f9-ef99-5bca-b0c4-dac5304ae36c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/30/realestate/30TICKET/30TICKET-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=901&w=600&s=007acdb6731adb080b8d3e8bf015125f2455c04db0a87f09efe80811ea776acc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,157 West 57th Street,221726f9-ef99-5bca-b0c4-dac5304ae36c,N24News/imgs/221726f9-ef99-5bca-b0c4-dac5304ae36c.jpg,7
Style,A Brooklyn Cocktail Bar With Live Music and Sushi,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/style/ponyboy-cocktail-bar-greenpoint-brooklyn.html,"Not every new bar in New York needs to be an Instagram-seducing set for tourists or birthday revelers, invariably lodged in a hotel underbelly. Cue Ponyboy, which opened in late September in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn.

Housed in the former Manhattan Inn (a piano joint that closed in 2016), Ponyboy flutters from cocktail bar to discotheque to music hall to underground sushi society by zephyr-like whim. On a recent evening, chef Michael Stember, one of the owners, wondered how to use an antechamber that contained a banquet table.

""Maybe this will be a kaiseki tearoom,"" Mr. Stember said. ""Maybe it will be a wine club. We have no idea where this is headed.""

Nested in a heavily trafficked section of Manhattan Avenue aside dollar stores and laundromats, Ponyboy has a squeezed bar that funnels into an open kitchen and, eventually, a larger, dimly lit room with a stage, banquette seating and a distinctive pitched skylight.","Ponyboy, a homey hangout in Greenpoint, offers a refreshing break from the cookie-cutter hotel bars.",2ad04aee-ddd6-588d-8ee5-a99de1e37fa0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/31/fashion/31boite-ponyboy-1/31boite-ponyboy-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=1abd9d81784b7627d24b7f975e79579e24284227e6fc9ae05624fadade47b2b0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The free-spirited scene at Ponyboy, a funky bar in the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn.",2ad04aee-ddd6-588d-8ee5-a99de1e37fa0,N24News/imgs/2ad04aee-ddd6-588d-8ee5-a99de1e37fa0.jpg,15
Dance,City Ballet Fires Two Male Dancers Named in Photo Sharing Scandal,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/15/arts/dance/city-ballet-fires-two-male-dancers-accused-of-sharing-photos.html,"New York City Ballet fired two principal male dancers on Saturday morning after they were named in a lawsuit in which a woman accused a third dancer of inappropriately sharing texts of sexually explicit photographs. City Ballet said it moved to act after assessing the conduct of the dancers and its impact on the company. The company dismissed Amar Ramasar, one of its brightest stars, and Zachary Catazaro after they were implicated in a photo-sharing scandal that has roiled City Ballet and now created a significant gap in its male roster just before its fall season begins. The third dancer, Chase Finlay, resigned last month. He was accused in the lawsuit of sending explicit pictures and videos of Alexandra Waterbury, a young woman he had been dating, to his friends without her consent, and asking others to send back explicit photos of their own. The episode has now forced out three of the 14 male principal dancers in the close-knit company.

The upheaval has added more turmoil to City Ballet in a year that began with Peter Martins, its longtime ballet master in chief, abruptly retiring under pressure after the company began investigating allegations of physical and sexual abuse that had been made against him. The company later said it had not corroborated the accusations, which Mr. Martins denied. City Ballet had initially moved last month to suspend Mr. Ramasar and Mr. Catazaro without pay until next year. The company had investigated the allegations against them and determined that they had ""engaged in inappropriate communications, that while personal, off-hours and off-site, had violated the norms of conduct"" it expects from dancers. The company said in a statement on Saturday that after hearing the concerns of dancers, staff members and others in the City Ballet community, it had decided to fire Mr. Ramasar and Mr. Catazaro. (The statement also said the company had already made the decision to fire Mr. Finlay when he resigned.) The two dancers released statements in which they expressed their sadness and characterized their firings as a rush to judgment by the company. The dancers' union, the American Guild of Musical Artists, said it planned to challenge the firings, which it said ""relate entirely to non-work related activity and do not rise to the level of 'just cause' termination.""

Mr. Ramasar said he had been disciplined for ""non-work lawful activities between consenting adults"" without an understanding of all the facts. ""The ballet already suspended me,"" he said, ""but now, due to pressure caused by a lawsuit filed against it (but not me), has expelled me to appease people who have no idea what really happened. In the days ahead, I will be telling my story.""

Mr. Catazaro said he had not played any role in any sharing of ""Alexandra Waterbury's personal material."" He said the private communications he was involved in had taken place during off-work hours and that ""the intent was not to harm or embarrass anyone."" The dismissals of Mr. Ramasar and Mr. Catazaro were announced at the company's morning class in its studios at the Rose Building at Lincoln Center, where City Ballet is preparing for its fall season, which is set to begin on Tuesday. ""We have no higher obligation than to ensure that our dancers and staff have a workplace where they feel respected and valued, and we are committed to providing that environment for all employees of New York City Ballet,"" the company's executive director, Katherine Brown, and the leader of its interim artistic team, Jonathan Stafford, said in a joint statement. ""We will not allow the private actions of a few to undermine the hard work and strength of character that is consistently demonstrated by the other members of our community or the excellence for which the company stands,"" they said. The allegations were detailed earlier this month in a lawsuit filed by Ms. Waterbury, 20, who had trained for several years at the School of American Ballet, the academy affiliated with City Ballet. The suit was against Mr. Finlay, whom she had dated, and the ballet company, which she accused of condoning a ""fraternity-like atmosphere."" The company denied that it condoned such behavior, noting that it had investigated the allegations as soon as it learned of them this summer and penalized the dancers.

In the suit, filed in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, Ms. Waterbury accused Mr. Finlay of sending nude photos of her to Mr. Ramasar, and said Mr. Ramasar had sent back an image of a bare-chested ""female ballet member."" The suit accused Mr. Catazaro of having exchanged images with Mr. Finlay, but did not specify of what. Mr. Ramasar, a principal since 2009, was one of the company's leading lights. Born in the Bronx, he established himself as one of City Ballet's most dynamic, charismatic presences in the core Balanchine repertory and, especially, in new work. This year he appeared as Jigger Craigin in the revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""Carousel"" at the Imperial Theater in what Ben Brantley described in The New York Times as ""an electric Broadway debut."" Mr. Catazaro, who was born in Canton, Ohio, became a principal dancer with the company in October. Ms. Waterbury's suit said that nude photos of other female dancers were also shared, and described lewd and misogynistic language in some of the texts, which she said she discovered on Mr. Finlay's computer. The suit said that one donor had written to Mr. Finlay about his desire to ""violate"" dancers at another company, and added, ""I bet we could tie some of them up and abuse them like farm animals."" It said Mr. Finlay replied ""or like the sluts they are."" Rob Daniels, a spokesman for City Ballet, said the company had identified the donor as a former member of the company's young patrons circle who had made modest contributions that totaled approximately $12,000 from 2010 to 2016. He said that at the suggestion of some of the dancers in the company, City Ballet would make a donation in that amount to a local charity focused on women's issues.","Amar Ramasar, one of the company's stars, and Zachary Catazaro were implicated in a lawsuit that has roiled the company.",633b1a85-cb58-5d8d-8a60-633d4a9eb252,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/16/arts/16nycb-p1-print-sub/00nycb-news-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=480a25e148d65c70b8592bd3f7dc5c399c993cef42ec2fd0c3aed84850490439&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Amar Ramasar, a principal dancer at New York City Ballet since 2009, had recently made his Broadway debut in &ldquo;Carousel.&rdquo;",633b1a85-cb58-5d8d-8a60-633d4a9eb252,N24News/imgs/633b1a85-cb58-5d8d-8a60-633d4a9eb252.jpg,6
Television,"'Trust' Season 1, Episode 3 Recap: Change of Management",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/arts/television/trust-recap-la-dolce-vita-fx.html,"Oh, the sweetness of questions answered. Therein lies the value of this week's episode of ""Trust."" Until now, a lot of mystery surrounded the kidnapping of J. Paul Getty's grandson, John Paul Getty III. Did Paul orchestrate all of it, or some of it, in order to get his grandpa to cough up some money and to finagle his way out of trouble with the Italian mob? Or was it more complicated than that -- so as to have placed Paul in real danger? This week's episode, titled ""La Dolce Vita"" (mockingly, it will turn out), serves mostly as a pragmatic answer to these questions. And unlikely as it might seem, the answer to both questions is ""yes."" But the episode's writer, Simon Beaufoy, and its director, Danny Boyle, make us work a little to figure that out. As they've done from the first moments of the series -- when we see an unexplained image of Paul's being chased through a field of sunflowers, his pursuer unknown -- this episode hops and skips from one timeline to the next, retracing moments we've already seen but from a different perspective, filling in bits of previously missing information along the way. So much of the sequencing is not chronological that it isn't until the very end that the full narrative picture coheres. Once we get there, the image of Paul among the sunflowers has context, and the reality behind it is more terrifying than one might have guessed. Because so much of this episode is about looking back to give us answers to outstanding questions, here, in brief, are the CliffsNotes to the most important ones. Why did Paul plan his own kidnapping? In this episode, Paul says he never wanted, asked for, nor has any Getty money. Nonetheless, to everyone else in Rome, his name equals colossal sums of accessible cash. It turns out that Paul's girlfriend, her twin sister and their friend Marcello were using the Getty name (unbeknown to Paul, oddly) in order to purchase cocaine on credit and continue their freewheeling, squat-living existence. We know, however, that Paul has no money, and the cocaine dealers -- who run their operation in the back of the restaurant where Paul often exchanged his paintings for a bite to eat -- are getting antsy for the $6,000 they're owed. This is when Paul travels to Sutton Place to try and settle up.

Having failed Paul returns to Italy and decides to cash in on the one asset he does have access to: himself. With that, he plans his own kidnapping with Bertolini (Giuseppe Battiston), the cocaine-dealing restaurant owner. The affair will be quick, Paul promises Bertolini, and soon he and his girlfriend will be off to Morocco to escape the Getty name and all its pressures and liabilities forever. So why is Paul in real trouble? Short answer: His own stupidity, and a horrifying man named Primo Nizzuto. There are a couple kinds of villains in the world. One is the coward, who forces himself to do bad things for the purpose of saving himself. Bertolini is one of those. The second is a lot scarier, the psychopath who lacks empathy for any living thing. Primo Nizzuto (Luca Marinelli) is one of those. Paul (here's where his stupidity comes in to play) starts to lose patience in his ""five star"" holding cell and escapes when his oaf of a guard isn't looking. (This explains how he is free the same night we see him place a sack over his own head; as James Fletcher Chace explained in Episode 2, the kidnapping note appeared on Paul's bed on a Thursday, and he kissed the girl in the club the following Saturday.) Bertolini decides the situation is too much to handle and makes a ""change of management,"" as Primo calls it, as a faster means to the cash he is owed. He orchestrates a plan to hand Paul off to Primo -- a man who, in an earlier scene, shot an elderly couple and his own partner in the head when a robbery went wrong, without a hint of trepidation. Then why didn't Bertolini's cronies know where Paul is? Short answer: The kidnapping exchange does not go as planned. What Bertolini doesn't account for is the psychopath factor. Primo kills Bertolini and his partner and keeps the money he was going to pay Bertolini (money we assume he got from the earlier robbery we've witnessed). The timeline isn't completely clear, but this most likely explains why Bertolini isn't present when Chace meets the mafia -- and why Chace is told that no one knows where Paul is: The man with the best lead is probably already dead. The exchange between Bertolini and Primo takes place in the countryside, in a field of sunflowers. At first, Bertolini believes his plan has worked, and he starts to drive away with his partner and with Primo's cash. But this seems too easy -- we're dealing with Primo, the lunatic -- and so it is. Paul, now with his new kidnapper, watches Primo coolly shoot Bertolini and his partner at long range with a rifle, as their car gets smaller in the distance. Terrified and understanding the real danger he is now in, Paul tries to run away (and thus, we have the context behind his sprint through the sunflower field).

Primo -- dapper in all powder blue (even Italian villains can dress) -- catches Paul without breaking a sweat. He makes Paul help him foist the corpses of Bertolini and his partner into the trunk of his car and then forces Paul to crawl into the trunk with them, carting all of them off to an undisclosed location. Paul's hoax has turned from ""theatrical"" (as Getty called it when he learned that Paul was behind it) to very dangerous indeed. At the very end, Paul warns Primo: ""You don't know my grandad; if he says he won't pay, he won't pay."" Primo, chomping on some food (it was a hard day's work, after all), responds through a translator, unconcerned as usual: ""No worry. They always pay in the end."" And so the veil of mystery has been lifted. ""La Dolce Vita"" has shown us how and why the kidnapping went down, and why it isn't over. What we missed out on this time around was an appearance from James Fletcher Chace. His starring role in Episode 2 was some of the most entertaining and best acting in the series so far. So we can look forward to his return to the screen, and to discovering how brutally unsympathetic Getty Sr. will be when he learns that this hoax is no longer so theatrical -- nor ending any time soon.
* The opening montage is a frenetic whirlwind, but it illuminates more clearly why Getty Sr. was so upset by Paul's appearance in the magazine spread. Paul and the twins are shown at the photo shoot, free-loving and doing a lot of blow. Paul's T-shirt mirrors the Coca-Cola slogan but actually reads ""Cocaine."" It's not hard to imagine old Getty's being miffed enough by this display to boot Paul from his home without a cent.
* The same opening sequence shows newsreels and images of real 1970s Italian newspapers covering riots and political unrest. They flash rapidly across the screen, but some are in reference to protests against the Vietnam War. In real life, Paul was known to have taken part in left-wing demonstrations. Here, he walks out of the photo shoot and jumps directly into the fray of a violent riot before he and his girlfriend escape and then are shown, gratuitously, having sex in public against a statue.","Even with the best laid plans, there's no accounting for a psychopath.",5ed6983b-1b1a-50b4-b580-7ea42b6bb006,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/05/watching/08trust/08billions-slide-A4HH-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=33b24956f6afbe86a34af385c8719a18d8fefa01c052047822949824c013a567&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Sarah Bellini, Luca Tanganelli, Harris Dickinson and Laura Bellini in ""Trust.""",5ed6983b-1b1a-50b4-b580-7ea42b6bb006,N24News/imgs/5ed6983b-1b1a-50b4-b580-7ea42b6bb006.jpg,3

""The investigation found that the Board Chair and Director acted in all respects with the best interests of the DIA in mind and did not find that they or any employee or volunteer at the DIA engaged in any misconduct related to the allegations included in the whistle-blower complaint,"" the museum said in a news release. ""There was no finding of any intention to mislead or hide information, nor was there any finding of any conflict of interest, violation of DIA policy or violation of applicable law.""

The institute said the law firm's report would not be made publicly available.

In the news release, it said the firm ""undertook an exhaustive review of key documents, interviews with numerous persons with relevant knowledge, and review of applicable law, related peer group policies and industry association guidance and best practices.""

It said the review had identified possible changes that could be made to the DIA's processes and policies in order to avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest ""and to clarify potential policy ambiguities,"" but it said it could not give details about what these are until the board has considered them further.

John N. Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid, said in a statement that neither he nor his clients were contacted by the law firm that conducted the review. That and the fact that the report was not being made public ""are sure signs that DIA is not serious about addressing the conflicts of interest disclosed by our clients,"" he said.

Art & Design,Philadelphia Contemporary Hires Artistic Director From Creative Time,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/arts/design/philadelphia-contemporary-nato-thompson.html,"The fledging art institution Philadelphia Contemporary may not yet have a home, but it now has an artistic director: Nato Thompson, currently the artistic director Creative Time. Mr. Thompson, who has been with Creative Time for a decade, will assume his new position in November, and aim to guide the institution as it moves from pop-up projects into a permanent building in Philadelphia.

Philadelphia Contemporary was founded last year by Harry Philbrick, who was previously the director of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. It has hosted various events and installations around the city, including poetry readings, midnight vigils, sculptures and an interactive art project with Emma Sulkowicz.

""We're working on what the mission is,"" Mr. Thompson said in a phone interview. ""Certainly we know it will be a noncollecting institution. It will be multidisciplinary and civically-driven."" He said he does not yet have any projects planned, or even a proposed budget to work with. The organization aims to move into a space in 2021 or 2022, and produce site-specific works around the city until then.

Mr. Thompson hopes to showcase both local and international art, and contribute to a growing Philadelphia art scene to complement pillars like the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. ""This is a city where it's very important to support the local arts community,"" Mr. Thompson said. ""It's got a great underground arts scene.

Books,Nudge Nudge: New Books by Eric Idle and John Cleese,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/28/books/review/always-look-on-the-bright-side-of-life-eric-idle.html,"He's not wrong. (He doesn't mention that one of those books was ""The Pythons Autobiography,"" published in 2003, which included contributions from all the Pythons, including Idle himself.) The question is how much Idle has to say on the subject that hasn't already been said.

""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"" is probably more for the hard-core Python aficionado than the casual fan, who may be baffled by unexplained references like ""Orson Welles was on the panel and he must have loved Mr. Creosote."" But there is plenty here that all fans, casual and otherwise, will appreciate.

I was particularly taken by Idle's recollection of how he came to write ""Bright Side,"" and how he came to record his vocal in a hotel bedroom in Tunisia while under the influence of a powerful local beverage. And I was touched by the mixture of pride and surprise with which he discusses how that song, which ""was supposed to be ironic,"" has taken on a life of its own as an anthem sung by British troops, British football fans and even mourners at British funerals, where Idle says it has replaced ""My Way"" as the most requested number.

I would have liked more stories about the creative process behind Idle's Python work. I would have also liked more about the Rutles, the Beatles parody band he created in the late 1970s with the frequent Python collaborator Neil Innes. Idle calls ""The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash,"" the hilarious fake documentary he wrote, co-directed and co-starred in (as the Paul to Innes's John), ""probably the most fun I ever had filming."" But for some reason -- perhaps because it was Innes and not Idle who wrote the songs -- this phase of his career gets relatively short shrift.

And I would have liked a lot less about Idle's many, many, many famous friends.

Of course, there's no reason he shouldn't write about his friends. ""I didn't seek them out,"" he sensibly observes. ""They found me. What am I supposed to say?"" It's just that so much of what he has to say about them consists of little more than dropping their names. (""Marty Scorsese threw us a party""; ""All of the Stones trooped in""; ""Suddenly I was making Steve Martin and Robin Williams laugh""; ""I have known Salman for some years."") Still, when he writes in depth about friends like George Harrison, who loved -- and, in the case of ""Life of Brian,"" helped bankroll -- the Pythons, and whom Idle clearly loved back (""He was irresistible""), the payoff can be powerful.","In ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life,"" Idle remembers the Pythons and other famous friends; in ""Professor at Large,"" Cleese revisits his years at Cornell.",ec143ea5-d305-5bbc-bc20-0997297c4a4a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/02/books/review/02Keepnews1/02Keepnews1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=022fbdafd61b4ba1a39a2abfaec3765d2483c0fb940686c153ec7d69fc341e24&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Eric Idle in the 1983 film ""Monty Python's The Meaning of Life.""",ec143ea5-d305-5bbc-bc20-0997297c4a4a,N24News/imgs/ec143ea5-d305-5bbc-bc20-0997297c4a4a.jpg,13
Science,A New Timeline of the Day the Dinosaurs Began to Die Out,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/science/chicxulub-asteroid-impact-dinosaurs.html,"A New Timeline of the Day the Dinosaurs Began to Die Out 
* None  The L/B Myrtle Offshore Support Vessel, a scientific platform in the Gulf of Mexico studying the Chicxulub asteroid's underwater crater.

The giant asteroid's impact into shallow waters in the Gulf of Mexico 66 million years ago was bad enough. But then an amalgam of additional disasters ensued: Rocks fell from the sky, wildfires ignited and tsunamis inundated distant shorelines. It was the beginning of the end of the Mesozoic Era when dinosaurs ruled the world. Scientists released a new record of this day of chaos in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday. Their timeline of the first day of the Cenozoic Era was developed using high-resolution photography, microscopy, computed tomography imaging and magnetic measurements of hundreds of feet of sedimentary rock recently recovered from Chicxulub, one of the largest impact craters on Earth. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] In 2016, researchers drilled deep in waters off the Yucatan Peninsula for the first time into Chicxulub's peak ring, a circle of mountains within the crater. This new study, led by Sean P. S. Gulick, a marine geophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin, focuses on a subset of these cores, which are effectively a 430-foot-long sedimentary rock record of the first day after the asteroid impact. ""We normally get to read rock records that give us centimeters per thousand years,"" Dr. Gulick said. ""We have 130 meters for a day."" A shaded relief image from NASA of the Yucatan Peninsula, showing the Chicxulub impact crater at upper left. Sean P. S. Gulick, a marine geophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin, aboard the Myrtle vessel in 2016. The researchers found that the first day of the Cenozoic was peppered with cataclysms. When the asteroid struck, it temporarily carved a hole 60 miles across and 20 miles deep. The impact triggered a tsunami moving away from the crater. It also catapulted rock into the upper atmosphere and beyond. ""Almost certainly some of the material would have reached the Moon,"" Dr. Gulick said. The largest pieces of debris rained back down to Earth within minutes, Dr. Gulick and his team say, pelting the scarred landscape with solidifying rock. Smaller particles lingered for longer periods, and glassy blobs known as tektites, formed when falling, molten rock cools, have been found across North America and dated to the Chicxulub impact. Within about 30 minutes, ocean water began to flood back into the crater through a gap in its northeastern rim, the researchers suggest. The roughly 300 feet of rock in the peak ring is sorted by size and is evidence of this flooding. ""If you throw a bunch of material into water and let it settle, the bigger things fall first and the smaller things take longer to fall,"" Dr. Gulick said. But this flooding was just ripples in a bathtub compared with what was coming next -- the water that had been violently displaced by the asteroid's impact was returning, the scientists say. Enormous tsunamis, with waves topping several hundred feet, rushed over the crater a few hours after the impact. Created when the asteroid struck the Gulf of Mexico, they reflected off nearby coastlines before barreling back toward the crater. They left behind a four-inch layer of sand and fine gravel in the peak ring containing perylene, a biomarker of soil. A rock sample taken from the Gulf of Mexico aboard the science vessel. In addition to the raining rocks and tsunamis , the landscape was also ravaged by widespread fires, Dr. Gulick and his team suggest. Fragments of charcoal in the peak ring above the tsunami layer are a sign of impact-induced wildfires, the researchers say. Wildfires could have been triggered by a blast of thermal energy from the impact plume, or by friction-heated rocks raining back down through the atmosphere. ""Probably not everything burned, but certainly there were global wildfires,"" Dr. Gulick said. These results provide ""unprecedented insights"" into what transpired the first day of the Cenozoic, said Paul Byrne, a planetary geologist at North Carolina State University who was not involved in the research. It's one thing to suspect impact-triggered chaos based on computer simulations, he said, but ""it's quite another to see it."" Earlier this year, another research team working in North Dakota reported finding the remnants of an ancient lake containing fossilized fish with tektites in their gills. These animals, they suggested, were likely killed within an hour of the asteroid strike by impact-triggered waves that tossed them onto land. Finding more evidence of the immediate aftermath of the Chicxulub impact will yield important scientific knowledge about the day the dinosaurs began to die out.","By drilling into the Chicxulub crater, scientists assembled a record of what happened just after the asteroid impact.",64d9640e-9c63-5773-abad-89487afad02d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/09/science/09TB-CRATER3/merlin_129883736_3e0dfd8d-7205-4797-8f6f-c25fffe0d2d2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=715599564f90150fbe9884a9754e205ebb2b4a0d3c947a50f4d81cd05b8e51b9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A shaded relief image from NASA of the Yucatán Peninsula, showing the Chicxulub impact crater at upper left.",64d9640e-9c63-5773-abad-89487afad02d,N24News/imgs/64d9640e-9c63-5773-abad-89487afad02d.jpg,2
Books,Vagabond Lives: Happier Memories From Kathryn Harrison's Childhood,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/books/review/kathryn-harrison-on-sunset.html,"""The Kiss"" landed in 1997, an early example of the dark-cornered memoirs that would dominate publishing for the next two decades, paving the way for the gimlet-eyed investigations of Rachel Cusk and the wincing beauty of Edward St. Aubyn's Patrick Melrose novels. At the time, there was much hand-wringing over the suggestion that the price of entry into this new/old publishing niche wasn't writerly chops but childhood abuse. It's also hard to fathom, in these #MeToo days, how much opprobrium was hurled at Harrison, in particular, for publicly unfurling her gnarled history, as if she were complicit in her father's crime. But with detachment and grace, Harrison, along with Mary Karr and Tobias Wolff, her literary compadres from that era, more than earned her right to revisit that territory.

And so to ""On Sunset,"" which describes not just a place (a house built on a precarious site) but the period into which Harrison was born. Her grandparents met late in life, and a daughter and granddaughter were ""the not unhappy surprises,"" as her grandfather tells Harrison, of that autumn union. Her grandfather was 50 and a traveling salesman. Her grandmother was 41 and had bucketed around the world -- the last stops before Los Angeles were London and the French Riviera -- as her family's fortunes waxed and waned, pursued by fortune hunters and energized by her passion for, among other things, fast cars. (Settling in Los Angeles, she brought her flair for speed and disregard for speed limits with her. ""What tosh,"" she exclaimed with typical insouciance when she failed a written driving test.)

She was a Sassoon, a member of an enormous merchant family from Baghdad known as the Rothschilds of the East. By the late 19th century, Harrison writes, they were responsible for 70 percent of the world's opium trade. Florid eccentricity was a family trait. Harrison's great-aunt Cecily was a lesbian who lived with not one but two lovers, all three in one bed. A visit from Cecily, accompanied by one of her inamoratas, riveted Harrison: The couple dressed alike in black, shared a single seat at the dinner table and ate from a single plate. Cousin George lived at the Plaza Athenee in Paris with his mother and at midcentury socialized with otherworldly characters like Gore Vidal, Jean Genet and David Niven. At 80, George is ""your fairy godmother, sweetie pie,"" he tells Harrison, and gives her a photograph of himself sporting angel wings and nothing else.

Harrison's grandfather came from humbler stock -- his mother ran a boardinghouse after her fishmonger husband died of consumption, and he was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker at 14 -- but he was as happily afflicted with wanderlust as her grandmother. As a child, Harrison delighted in naming the many New World cities, from Quebec City to Juneau, that he stopped to work in as an engineer or a timekeeper or an accountant. At home on Sunset Boulevard, he wore dress suits and white shirts when gardening. (He never bought new clothes, having a full wardrobe left over from the sample cases of his life as a traveling salesman.) He was gentle, handy and resourceful, tending a vegetable garden, planting succulents to shore up the eroding cliffside property, building a chair high in a tree so Harrison could read ""Alice in Wonderland"" among the branches.","Her previous memoirs delved into her parents' traumatic influence. Now, in ""On Sunset,"" she introduces the beloved Old World grandparents who raised her.",19cec405-ceff-5666-8bdd-0264ae5a58b1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/04/books/review/04green1/04green1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=c0eb1f3f021595aa84679018bb327bd74c7c08f74fb581b48d43423929a44cdf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Kathryn Harrison in Scripps Park, La Jolla, 1969.",19cec405-ceff-5666-8bdd-0264ae5a58b1,N24News/imgs/19cec405-ceff-5666-8bdd-0264ae5a58b1.jpg,13
Sports,"Rules, Rescheduled Games and a Covenant Worth Preserving",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/sports/soccer/rules-rescheduled-games-and-a-covenant-worth-preserving.html,"Jurgen Klopp as he probably looked upon realizing that the Premier League season would pick up where it left off: with Liverpool in first.



If you are enjoying this newsletter every Friday, please pass it on to a friend (or four) and tell them to sign up at nytimes.com/rory. The Premier League Handbook is so long that calling it a handbook is, in many ways, a bit of a stretch. It runs, all told, to 665 pages. It falls somewhere between a particularly dense instruction manual and an especially didactic piece of scripture. It lays out, in a sea of sections and subsections, exactly how a club must be run if it wishes to be part of the most popular domestic sports league in the world. And exactly means exactly: No stone is left unturned, no detail uncovered. What players must wear while performing off-field duties: clothing bearing the club's crest. How long a postgame warm-down can last: 15 minutes, and not a second longer. What teams are and are not allowed to show on the big screens in their home stadiums: no rolling live footage, thank you very much.

The only thing that is not included, as became abundantly clear on the evening of March 13, is what might happen if the league season cannot be completed. Section C -- ""The League Championship"" -- had nothing to say on the matter. The handbook will, presumably, be updated; there is already a 50-page appendix governing how teams should safely return to training in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, which forced the season's suspension more than two months ago. That will be done either by decree or according to precedent, but the absence of such instruction felt then (and it still feels now) like something of an oversight. The arrival of an aggressive pathogen is, after all, not the only thing that might have caused the cessation of soccer. War has done it in the past, civil unrest has done it elsewhere, and player strikes have managed it in other sports. Given soccer's economics, it is not entirely unimaginable that the collapse of a broadcast partner might pose an existential threat, too. But the handbook did not offer guidance. This was the one eventuality nobody seemed to have considered. It spoke only silence. And so, for the last two months, there has been nothing but noise.

Only on Thursday, as the end of May drew close, did they land upon one. In Germany, the Bundesliga had already been playing for two weeks. In Spain, the game's authorities had long since committed themselves to playing out the season. In France, where the league's hand was forced by the government, Paris St.-Germain had already been named champion. Now, at last, England has a way forward, too: The Premier League will return on June 17, as long as it retains political permission and there is no spike in either the positive tests returned by players or the infection rate across Britain. If the league cannot return, the season will be determined on a points-per-game basis (effectively freezing the table as it stands, with one or two exceptions). It will name a champion. It will relegate its three worst teams. At last, the idea of ""null and void"" is off the table. For a while, that seemed to be the preferred solution of a number of teams who exist entirely to play soccer. For some time, there has been a constituency in the Premier League to whom all that matters is being there: not excelling, not winning games, not entertaining anyone, but simply existing in the top flight of English soccer. Null and void seemed to be the natural conclusion of that approach: It did not matter if anyone played soccer at all, it turned out, as long as they could keep cashing those television checks. It was initially dressed up in an understandable, fairly compelling, morality: The very idea that soccer should return was almost offensive, they said. Then, later: The idea that the season should be played out in empty stadiums, compromising its integrity, was unfair, they said. Then, later still: Soccer could be played without fans, they said, but not at neutral venues; or it could be played at neutral venues, but nobody could be relegated. There is merit to some of these arguments. Certainly, in April, it felt distasteful to try to map out the return of a mere sport (we have established previously that it is morally OK to miss sports, no matter what else is going on) as the pandemic raged at its peak and it seemed there was no end to the nightmare.

Less significantly, the Bundesliga's experience does suggest that the absence of fans has a dramatic impact on results: Home-field advantage seems, almost overnight, to have disappeared in Germany. And it is true that the desire to play games at neutral venues -- in case crowds gather outside stadiums -- is, in essence, an egregious insult to those fans upon whom the entire edifice rests. That those arguments have not won the day, though, is a relief. Not because the only ""fair"" way to settle the season was always to play it out. Not because of the economic imperative -- for the health of the clubs and, to some extent, the game as a whole -- to find a way back. And not because it is necessarily right that soccer will return. It remains, after all, a delicate balance. There is no guarantee that the English -- or even the German -- season will be able to finish. It may well be that one or both will be decided, in the end, off the field, by some mathematical formula.

But that is vastly preferable to voiding it, to scratching it from the record books, pretending it never happened, starting over whenever we can. Not because that was never really necessary, or because it is inherently unfair, or because it prioritizes things that did not happen over things that did. No, it is preferable for a much more fundamental reason. There is a covenant between fans and the sports they follow. It assures that what the fans are watching, what they are investing their time and money in, counts for something. It matters. It has meaning -- an artificial meaning, something that we impose, rather than something inherent, but a meaning nonetheless. To write off the season, then, would not only strip the first nine months of this season of that meaning, it would also jeopardize the meaning of any season in the future. It would make it hard to invest financially in a season ticket or a television subscription. More important, frankly, it would make it hard to invest emotionally in a team again.

Why would you, after all, if someone might tell you a few months later that what you were watching happened, but didn't count, didn't mean anything? Voiding the season would have ruptured the bond we have with the sport. One of the rationales you hear, frequently, from those who would have abandoned it is that -- at a time like this -- soccer doesn't matter. Cancellation would have been confirmation that it doesn't matter at any time. That, perhaps, is what the revised Premier League Handbook should reflect. Just an addendum to Section C: a clause that says, in case the worst should happen again, what you are watching, what you are playing in, what you are part of, cannot be extinguished by some force majeure. It will all, in the end, count for something. This Is the Future, for Now. We Might as Well Try.

There is a golden rule of the internet. It is not, despite what a lot of people think, Godwin's Law. It is this: If you put something online, at some point in the process some man -- and it is, essentially, always a man -- will hijack it for the purposes of some form of sexual gratification. And so nobody, but nobody, should have been surprised on Thursday that when the Danish club AGF Aarhus invited fans to follow its first game of the resumed season on Zoom, two men had to be cut from the feed by the club's moderator for exposing themselves. (Thankfully, before their little stunt had been seen by anyone.) It is a bleak reality, don't get me wrong. It isn't funny. I can't explain it. I don't even begin to understand it. But it should also not distract from the fact that there is something encouraging in Aarhus's experiment. If we accept that fans are not going to be in stadiums for some time, then clubs, leagues and broadcasters should be looking for ways not so much to soften the blow, but to adapt. In Germany, the league's broadcaster is offering ambient crowd noise to viewers watching at home. In South Korea, it was pumped directly into the stadium. Bringing fans into the stands through Zoom is a valiant attempt to go a step farther. (Our friend Tariq Panja wrote about the AGF match, and the video is fun.)

There was a suggestion, presented to me by a friend not long ago, that could solve so many problems, and that made such perfect sense, that it was inevitable, really, that English soccer should ignore it completely. It ran like this. The glamour and significance of the F.A. Cup have been fading for years. It now ranks, for most teams, as either a nuisance or an afterthought. It's a competition for the reserves and the squad players and the stiffs. Many fans treat it with contempt. It serves, too often, as an unwelcome interruption of the league season. But this year's edition would need to be finished. So, rather than trying to squeeze it in amid a breathless schedule of Premier League games, why not wait? Why not allow the league to finish, and then play the last three rounds of the Cup -- quarterfinals, semifinals, final -- in a single week, all at the same location? It would be an emergency measure, of course, given the circumstances, but there is absolutely no reason this should not be how the F.A. Cup works in future. It is perfect: Rather than cluttering up the calendar and disfiguring the league through March and April, the cup can be put on ice from the quarterfinal stage. Everyone gets a bit of breathing room, some time to think.

Last week's column on the effect of Athletic Bilbao's buy-local approach to transfers prompted quite a few questions. Patricia Zengerle had mixed feelings about the idea, asking: ""In an international, multicultural sport, does the team stay white white white?"" The answer is not entirely -- Athletic's star performer this year has been the striker Inaki Williams -- and the policy does not officially see color, as it were. But (without having conducted a survey) I would guess that Athletic's team is whiter than most in Spain, and has been for some time. Daniel Arbelaez wrote that the ""underlying elements of nationalism"" in the policy were ""disturbing."" Edward Baker pointed out that Athletic's definition of ""Basque"" can be traced to Sabino Arana, the father of Basque nationalism, who is now widely regarded as a problematic figure. ""There is nothing, absolutely nothing, charming about this repulsive blood-and-soil nationalism and its expression in the history of Athletic de Bilbao,"" Baker wrote. There is, of course, an uncomfortable undertone to the roots of Athletic's approach, and one that should have been acknowledged; these are valid critiques. So, too, is the reminder from the author Phil Ball that other teams in the Basque region tend to suffer from Athletic's predation of the best local talent. It would not be possible for Athletic's model to be implemented directly elsewhere; in an ideological sense, it would not necessarily be desirable. Last week's column was an attempt not to condone that, but rather to suggest that what could be learned is that it is possible both to find pleasure in and to take pride from a sports team while accepting that it will not win all of the time.","The Premier League has finally resisted the temptation to pretend the 2019-20 season never happened.

Movies,Review: 'Mama Africa' Remembers the Life of Miriam Makeba,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/movies/mama-africa-review-miriam-makeba.html,"More than once, the documentary ""Mama Africa: Miriam Makeba!"" quotes what the South African singer and activist would say when asked about political content in her music: ""I don't sing politics. I sing the truth.""

Even so, it's hard not to wish that the Finnish director Mika Kaurismaki's primer on Ms. Makeba (1932-2008) had a stronger point of view. Like many biographical documentaries, it resembles a lengthy highlight reel of crucial events from its subject's life, without much in the way of style or perspective.

Ms. Makeba's life was, of course, more than eventful enough to sustain a movie. ""Mama Africa"" remembers her appearance in the film ""Come Back, Africa"" and performances with Harry Belafonte; her 31-year exile from South Africa after the apartheid-era government revoked her passport; her anti-apartheid activism before the United Nations; her marriage to the black-power activist Stokely Carmichael (a union that's said to have caused concerts in the United States to be canceled because of controversy surrounding Mr. Carmichael); and her return to South Africa following Nelson Mandela's release from prison.

Mr. Kaurismaki (a brother of Aki Kaurismaki, who made the recent ""The Other Side of Hope"") includes the tributes of family members and former musical collaborators. More crucially, he has considerable footage of Ms. Makeba in concert and in interviews. At one point, she says that she wishes that the song ""Pata Pata,"" about a dance, hadn't become such a signature tune; she would have preferred another song with more meaningful lyrics.",The documentary presents a highlight reel of crucial events from the South African singer and activist's life.,befbc974-71c7-5278-8974-a40a9869e655,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/17/movies/miriam1/miriam1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=c353586d49649c5bb4c8e13fa8eb41a84fb4d3ff47d0653fcee1ff001cc8eecd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Miriam Makeba in the documentary ""Mama Africa.""",befbc974-71c7-5278-8974-a40a9869e655,N24News/imgs/befbc974-71c7-5278-8974-a40a9869e655.jpg,5
Technology,The Coronavirus Revives Facebook as a News Powerhouse,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/technology/coronavirus-facebook-news.html,"Until recently, Facebook could feel at times like the virtual equivalent of a sleepy bingo parlor -- an outmoded gathering place populated mainly by retirees looking for conversation and cheap fun. That was before the coronavirus. Now, stuck inside their homes and isolated from their families and friends, millions of Americans are rediscovering the social network's virtues. That has lifted usage of Facebook features like messaging and video calls to record levels and powered a surge in traffic for publishers of virus-related news. As of Thursday, more than half the articles being consumed on Facebook in the United States were related to the coronavirus, according to an internal report obtained by The New York Times. Overall U.S. traffic from Facebook to other websites also increased by more than 50 percent last week from the week before, ""almost entirely"" owing to intense interest in the virus, the report said. The report, which was posted to Facebook's internal network by Ranjan Subramanian, a data scientist at the company, was a lengthy analysis of what it called an ""unprecedented increase in the consumption of news articles on Facebook"" over the past several weeks.

According to the report, more than 90 percent of the clicks to coronavirus content came from ""Power News Consumers"" and ""Power News Discussers"" -- Facebook's terms for users who read and comment on news stories much more frequently than the average user. The company is now considering several options for targeting those people with higher-quality information to make sure it is ""being spread downstream."" ""These users are having an extraordinary impact on the coronavirus information diet of other Facebook users,"" Mr. Subramanian wrote. The report shows that Facebook is closely monitoring people's news habits during a critical period and actively trying to steer them toward authoritative sources in what amounts to a global, real-time experiment in news distribution. At times, Facebook itself seemed unsure which news sources users would turn to in a crisis, with Mr. Subramanian noting that ""fortunately"" many people were clicking on links from publishers that the company considers high-quality. Facebook's revival as a dominant news hub is a striking shift. Sharing of news stories on the social network had declined for years, partly because the company tried to emphasize feel-good personal posts over polarizing national news.

In 2018, Facebook overhauled its News Feed algorithm to show more posts by family and friends, which hurt news and entertainment publishers who relied on it for traffic. Some of those publishers shut down as a result of Facebook's changes, while others were forced to seek traffic elsewhere. As of last week, much of the new, virus-related traffic on Facebook was flowing to mainstream news outlets. The Washington Post got 119 percent more clicks on its Facebook links during a two-week period this month than in the same period last month, while traffic to articles published by The Atlantic more than quadrupled over the same period, according to the report. The Times's Facebook traffic has grown by 180 percent, while traffic to NBC News rose 160 percent. In a statement, Campbell Brown, Facebook's vice president for global news partnerships, said, ""We are working overtime to help people find and share credible information right now which includes important news from local and national publishers, and expert health organizations. We're actively testing ways to ensure people see more timely and explanatory Covid-19 related news and information, while out-of-date news gets demoted."" Facebook's report also listed the ""news ecosystem quality"" score, or NEQ, for 100 of its top publishers. Those scores, which Facebook adopted last year and has never spoken about publicly, are calculated based on a number of variables, including whether an outlet is broadly trusted by Facebook users and whether it has a history of sharing clickbait or misinformation. They are one of many factors that determine how often an outlet's articles show up on users' News Feeds. Many of the highest scores listed on the report belonged to large, mainstream news organizations like CNN, The Times and The Post. The report claimed that since early March, when stories about the coronavirus outbreak began catching on with American Facebook users, those users have sought out news from higher-quality sources than usual. ""We are continuing to see that people are on average reading Covid-19 content from higher-NEQ publishers compared to the other news links they are consuming,"" it said.

That was good news for those publishers -- and for society, given the relationship between getting accurate information about the virus and taking proper health precautions to limit its spread. But it was bad news for publishers with lower scores. The Daily Mirror, a British tabloid that had the most clicks from Facebook of any English-language publisher in February, had its traffic drop 28 percent this month. And Facebook traffic to The Daily Wire, a conservative publication that ranked third in clicks among all English-language publications on Facebook in February, fell 20 percent. These trends may signal that users are seeking out more authoritative sources on their own. It could also indicate that Facebook was changing its algorithms to promote content from high-quality publishers. The report mentioned an experiment called ""Mixshift Higher NEQ Health Links,"" which was meant to test the effects of elevating higher-quality publications in Facebook's News Feed on health-related topics. The report called the test's initial results ""promising,"" although it also said the change had not yet formally launched. The outlets with the biggest drops in traffic over the month specialize in news unrelated to the virus. Mashable, the technology website, had its Facebook traffic plummet by 72 percent this month, according to the report, while Facebook traffic to BET and Sports Illustrated each dropped more than 50 percent. The report noted that local news publishers had gotten a bigger boost in traffic than nonlocal outlets, reflecting users' interest in how the virus is affecting their immediate communities. Facebook has not been entirely successful at keeping virus-related misinformation from spreading. Last week, a Medium post written by a tech marketer that played down the virus's seriousness was shared on Facebook more than 50,000 times, according to data from CrowdTangle, a Facebook-owned data platform.

The post, whose author claimed it had gotten 2.6 million views, was later taken down by Medium for violating the site's policies. A Medium spokeswoman, Sandee Roston, said the post was removed ""based on its violation of our rules, specifically the risk analysis framework we use for controversial, suspect and extreme content."" Facebook's report, which lists 100 English-language news publishers ranked by the number of clicks they received from the social network in February, also provided a rare glimpse of where users typically get their news. The Daily Mirror, The Daily Mail and The Daily Wire made up the top three, followed by GoFundMe, the crowdfunding site. The BBC, CNN, The Washington Post, and Fox News appeared in the top 10, while MSNBC ranked 79th, behind Breitbart, Page Six, and ScaryMommy.com. The report also hinted at Facebook's potential to use its enormous data trove to predict the spread of the virus. Detailed maps and charts in the report showed the rapid spread of the virus coinciding with increased traffic to coronavirus-related news stories. As of Feb. 19, few Americans were reading about the virus, according to the report. Two weeks later, nearly 1 out of every 5 articles clicked on in the Pacific Northwest, where the virus first took hold in the nation, were about the outbreak. By March 19, a ""radical change"" had occurred: Nearly half of all articles clicked on across the United States were about the coronavirus. The report, which noted a ""somewhat correlated"" relationship between users' interest in virus-related news and confirmed cases in a region, also included maps showing regions where interest in the pandemic was on the rise, including areas of South America, Southeast Asia and Africa. In Eastern Europe, the report noted a ""huge increase"" in the number of people interested in virus news in countries including Poland and Ukraine, which did not align with the number of cases reported in those places. Should those countries begin reporting higher numbers, it could show that Facebook data is a leading indicator of where the virus may have taken hold.","More than half of all news consumption on Facebook in America is about the virus, according to an internal report.",fa7139e4-a2ed-5140-9ad6-691b66a42feb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/23/business/23fb-news/23fb-news-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a53afa5d3dea304e294d7840d98b2408ee7e659ce813db17e3d49c887e55d6bb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Millions of Americans are rediscovering Facebook and using it to connect to their family and friends during a time of isolation.,fa7139e4-a2ed-5140-9ad6-691b66a42feb,N24News/imgs/fa7139e4-a2ed-5140-9ad6-691b66a42feb.jpg,20
Books,How Christians Destroyed the Ancient World,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/books/review/catherine-nixey-darkening-age.html,"THE DARKENING AGE 

The Christian Destruction of the Classical World 

By Catherine Nixey

 Illustrated. 315 pp. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $28. Vandalizing the Parthenon temple in Athens has been a tenacious tradition. Most famously, Lord Elgin appropriated the ""Elgin marbles"" in 1801-5. But that was hardly the first example. In the Byzantine era, when the temple had been turned into a church, two bishops -- Marinos and Theodosios -- carved their names on its monumental columns. The Ottomans used the Parthenon as a gunpowder magazine, hence its pockmarked masonry -- the result of an attack by Venetian forces in the 17th century. Now Catherine Nixey, a classics teacher turned writer and journalist, takes us back to earlier desecrations, the destruction of the premier artworks of antiquity by Christian zealots (from the Greek zelos -- ardor, eager rivalry) in what she calls ""The Darkening Age."" Using the mutilation of faces, arms and genitals on the Parthenon's decoration as one of her many, thunderingly memorable case studies, Nixey makes the fundamental point that while we lionize Christian culture for preserving works of learning, sponsoring exquisite art and adhering to an ethos of ""love thy neighbor,"" the early church was in fact a master of anti-intellectualism, iconoclasm and mortal prejudice. This is a searingly passionate book. Nixey is transparent about the particularity of her motivation. The daughter of an ex-nun and an ex-monk, she spent her childhood filled with respect for the wonders of postpagan Christian culture. But as a student of classics she found the scales -- as it were -- falling from her eyes. She wears her righteous fury on her sleeve. This is scholarship as polemic. A statue of Athena, decapitated by early Christians, who considered it idolatrous, and reconstructed by archaeologists. Nixey writes up a storm. Each sentence is rich, textured, evocative, felt. Christian monks in silent orders summoned up pagan texts from library stores with a gagging hand gesture. The destruction of the extraordinary, frankincense-heavy temple of Serapis in Alexandria is described with empathetic detail; thousands of books from its library vanished, and the temple's gargantuan wooden statue of the god was dismembered before being burned. One pagan eyewitness, Eunapius, remarked flintily that the only ancient treasure left unlooted from the temple was its floor.

Christians became known as those ""who move that which should not be moved."" Their laudable appeal to have-nots at the bottom of the pile, both free and unfree, meant that bishops had a citizen-army of pumped-up, undereducated young men ready to rid the world of sin. Enter the parabalini, sometime stretcher-bearers, sometime assassins, who viciously flayed alive the brilliant Alexandrian mathematician and pagan philosopher Hypatia. Or the circumcellions (feared even by other Christians), who invented a kind of chemical weapon using caustic lime soda and vinegar so they could carry out acid attacks on priests who didn't share their beliefs. Debate -- philosophically and physiologically -- makes us human, whereas dogma cauterizes our potential as a species. Through the sharing of new ideas the ancients identified the atom, measured the circumference of the earth, grasped the environmental benefits of vegetarianism. To be sure, Christians would not have a monopoly on orthodoxy, or indeed on suppression: The history of the ancient world typically makes for stomach-churning reading. Pagan philosophers too who flew in the face of religious consensus risked persecution; Socrates, we must not forget, was condemned to death on a religious charge.

But Christians did fetishize dogma. In A.D. 386 a law was passed declaring that those ""who contend about religion ... shall pay with their lives and blood."" Books were systematically burned. The doctrinal opinions of one of the most celebrated early church fathers, St. John Chrysostom -- he of the Golden Mouth -- were enthusiastically quoted in Nazi Germany 1,500 years after his death: The synagogue ""is a den of robbers and a lodging for wild beasts ... a dwelling of demons."" Actions were extreme because paganism was considered not just a psychological but a physical miasma. Christianity appeared on a planet that had been, for at least 70,000 years, animist. (Asking the women and men of antiquity whether they believed in spirits, nymphs, djinns would have been as odd as asking them whether they believed in the sea.) But for Christians, the food that pagans produced, the bathwater they washed in, their very breaths were thought to be infected by demons. Pollution was said to make its way into the lungs of bystanders during animal sacrifice. And once Christianity became championed by Rome, one of the most militaristic civilizations the world has known, philosophical discussions on the nature of good and evil became martial instructions for purges and pugilism.

Still, contrary to Nixey, there was not utter but rather partial destruction of the classical world. The vigorous debates in Byzantine cultures about whether, for example, magical texts were demonic suggest that these works continued to have influence in Christian Europe. The material culture of the time also lends nuance to Nixey's story: Silverware and dining services in Byzantium were proudly decorated with images of the ""Iliad"" and ""Odyssey."" And while 90 percent of all ancient literature has been lost, paganism still had a foothold on the streets. In Constantinople, the spiritual headquarters of Eastern Christendom, the seventh-century church was still frantically trying to ban the Bacchanalian festivities that legitimized cross-dressing, mask-wearing and Bacchic adulation. I read this book while tracing the historical footprint of the Bacchic cult. On the tiny Greek island of Skyros, men and children, even today, dress as half human, half animal; they wear goat masks, and dance and drink on Bacchus' festival days in honor of the spirit of the god. It seems that off the page there was a little more continuity than Christian authorities would like to admit. But the spittle-flecked diatribes and enraging accounts of gruesome martyrdoms and persecution by pagans were what the church chose to preserve and promote. Christian dominance of academic institutions and archives until the late 19th century ensured a messianic slant for Western education (despite the fact that many pagan intellectuals were disparaging about the boorish, ungrammatical nature of early Christian works like the Gospels). As Nixey puts it, the triumph of Christianity heralded the subjugation of the other. And so she opens her book with a potent description of black-robed zealots from 16 centuries ago taking iron bars to the beautiful statue of Athena in the sanctuary of Palmyra, located in modern-day Syria. Intellectuals in Antioch (in ancient Syria) were tortured and beheaded, as were the statues around them. The contemporary parallels glare. The early medieval author known as Pseudo-Jerome wrote of Christian extremists: ""Because they love the name martyr and because they desire human praise more than divine charity, they kill themselves."" He would have found shocking familiarity in the news of the 21st century. Nixey closes her book with the description of another Athena, in the city of her name, being decapitated around A.D. 529, her defiled body used as a steppingstone into what was once a world-renowned school of philosophy. Athena was the deity of wisdom. The words ""wisdom"" and ""historian"" have a common ancestor, a proto-Indo-European word meaning to see things clearly. Nixey delivers this ballista-bolt of a book with her eyes wide open and in an attempt to bring light as well as heat to the sad story of intellectual monoculture and religious intolerance. Her sympathy, corruscatingly, compellingly, is with the Roman orator Symmachus: ""We see the same stars, the sky is shared by all, the same world surrounds us. What does it matter what wisdom a person uses to seek for the truth?""","Catherine Nixey's ""The Darkening Age"" tells a story of desecration on an enormous scale.",cfcc9edd-f235-5bd0-9d56-05207f73912b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/10/books/review/10Hughes-SUB01/10Hughes-SUB01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=545&w=1042&s=199c08557c8cb4a9c64c6a7812f148ade24332a4922387fa3f93bc45e4ee7db2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,St. John Chrysostom.,cfcc9edd-f235-5bd0-9d56-05207f73912b,N24News/imgs/cfcc9edd-f235-5bd0-9d56-05207f73912b.jpg,13
Automobiles,This Tour de France Never Leaves New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/13/automobiles/collectibles/this-tour-de-france-never-leaves-new-york.html,"On Sunday, French expatriates, Francophiles and fans of old French cars and motorized bicycles will gather to celebrate Bastille Day -- a day early -- with a rally through the streets of Manhattan.

This will be the 15th year for the Bastille Day Rally and Rendez-Vous. Howie Seligmann, co-founder and organizer of the sponsor group, the Greater New York Citroen and Velosolex Touring Club, said he expected 40 Citroen cars and about 15 Velosolex motorized bicycles to show up, as well as a few interlopers from Renault, Panhard and even non-French marques.

After gathering at 9 a.m. at Grant's Tomb on Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, the vehicles will wind through Manhattan to 60th Street at Fifth Avenue, where they will be displayed at the Bastille Day fair of the French Institute Alliance Francaise.

French automakers left America years ago, but Francophiles still celebrate the cars left behind. Angela Goding, director of development at MoMA PS1 and owner of a 1969 Citroen DS, summed up the appeal: ""Old French cars are quirky and unreliable -- but like Buddhas in that they teach us patience and the necessity of going with the flow.""",Fans of French cars and motorized bicycles are holding a rally around the streets of New York on Sunday.,f610ead1-cd61-543a-8a94-adc7204250a0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/13/automobiles/BASTILLE/BASTILLE-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=387&w=600&s=579be51aec84a4a5222cb3c8efc2b27dc40d4ac079f33a3667d54e646515cf90&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Citroën 2CVs at the Washington Square arch during the 2012 Bastille Day rally in New York.,f610ead1-cd61-543a-8a94-adc7204250a0,N24News/imgs/f610ead1-cd61-543a-8a94-adc7204250a0.jpg,23

Especially on the band's latest album, ""Freedom,"" there's a refreshing restraint to their work, stripping away most of rock's maximalism in favor of gentle, reverb-laden riffs that spotlight McMahon's distinctive, ever-so-slightly wavering voice. The result is pleasant, mild chaos with enough familiar sounds to be an easy listen. The electronic artist Arthur opens. 

212-777-6800, mercuryeastpresents.com/warsawconcerts TONI BRAXTON at Kings Theater (Feb. 7, 8 p.m.). This R&B titan takes over the cavernous theater in Flatbush, Brooklyn, for a show that has long been sold out (though tickets are available via resellers). Braxton specializes in dramatic, emotional epics, songs that are practically operatic in scope; her most enduring hit is ""Un-Break My Heart,"" a sweeping power ballad. Most remarkable, though, is that Braxton's style has remained constant in spite of shifting R&B trends. Her 2018 album ""Sex & Cigarettes,"" a collection of cathartic, unrelenting songs about infidelity, earned three Grammy nominations. The trio SWV, responsible for chart toppers such as ""Weak"" and ""Right Here,"" will also perform. 

718-856-5464, kingstheatre.com ESTELLE at Baby's All Right (Feb. 6, 8 p.m.). This British singer's 2008 major-label debut is best known for its smash hit ""American Boy,"" which features Kanye West as her raffish suitor. The release had another minor hit, though: ""Come Over,"" a pop-reggae song featuring Sean Paul. Estelle, whose father is from Grenada, revisited reggae and dancehall on her most recent record, 2018's ""Lover's Rock"" -- a tribute to the buoyant, romantic British reggae subgenre that goes by the same name. The album, released on the legendary reggae label VP Records, features heavy hitters including Chronixx, Tarrus Riley and Konshens.

SHAMIR at Brooklyn Bazaar (Feb. 2, 8 p.m.). Pinning a genre to this singer-songwriter from Las Vegas is challenging. His 2015 debut, ""Ratchet,"" is eclectic synth-pop with 1980s flair; his latest, last year's ""Resolution,"" is stripped-down indie rock that includes songs like ""I Can't Breathe,"" which focuses on police killings, and ""The Things You Loved,"" which has a folksy twang. There are constants, though: Shamir's instantly identifiable voice -- high and sweet with an acidic edge -- and his songwriting. Even as his sound becomes more rough-hewed, his songs remain taut and compelling.

bkbazaar.com TIBET HOUSE US BENEFIT CONCERT at Carnegie Hall (Feb. 7, 7:30 p.m.). For the 32nd year in a row, Tibet House US, an organization devoted to preserving Tibetan culture and protecting its refugees, will host an all-star musical benefit. This year's edition, curated by Philip Glass, a longtime participant, includes Laurie Anderson, Jon Batiste, Debbie Harry, Jason Isbell, Angelique Kidjo, Nathaniel Rateliff, New Order's Bernard Sumner and the Tibetan artist Tenzin Choegyal. Stephen Colbert will be on hand for comic relief. And surprise one-off collaborations are likely; last year, Patti Smith and Angel Olsen covered the Velvet Underground's ""I Found a Reason.""

TRIBALISTAS at the Hammerstein Ballroom (Feb. 5, 8 p.m.). The singers Arnaldo Antunes, Marisa Monte and Carlinhos Brown were already stars in Brazil before joining forces to record their 2002 album, ""Tribalistas."" A collection of lilting songs in the tradition of what's known as ""musica popular brasileira"" -- a post-bossa-nova movement dedicated to integrating international sounds into Brazilian music -- the album boosted the supergroup to international success, selling over three million copies globally. It took 15 years for the trio to release a follow-up, also simply called ""Tribalistas""; now, they're performing in New York for the first time as a group.

800-745-3000, mc34.com [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] YOLA at Rockwood Music Hall, Stage 2 (Feb. 6, 7 p.m.). Country-soul seems overdue for some mainstream attention, thanks to the parallel success of old-school singers like Leon Bridges and Charles Bradley, and outlaw-era-inspired country stars like Chris Stapleton and Miranda Lambert. Yola, whose Southern soul sound belies her upbringing in southwest England, is as good a candidate as any to spark such a renaissance. Her rich alto fits in seamlessly alongside the slide guitars, jangling piano and lush arrangements on her upcoming debut, ""Walk Through Fire,"" produced by the Black Keys' Dan Auerbach.

NATALIE WEINER

J. D. ALLEN QUARTET at Smoke (Feb. 1-2, 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m.). One of today's premier tenor saxophonists, Allen spent the last decade working with a steady trio, developing a sturdy but flexible sound based around minor melodies and bristling postbop rhythms. But he recently assembled a new trio featuring a couple of younger musicians, the bassist Ian Kenselaar and the drummer Nic Cacioppo. The early returns are good: An appearance at Winter Jazzfest, where the new trio was joined by the tenor saxophone luminary David Murray, showed how ably the young players have adapted to Allen's personal style. This weekend the group performs with another of Allen's frequent collaborators: the crisply expressive guitarist Liberty Ellman.

212-864-6662, smokejazz.com JIMMY COBB at Jazz Standard (Jan. 31-Feb. 3, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Cobb, a drummer and National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, will probably be remembered as the drummer whose crackling ride cymbal adorned Miles Davis's 1959 classic, ""Kind of Blue."" But his career is much bigger than that one date: He accompanied Sarah Vaughan and John Coltrane and Freddie Hubbard, playing on countless record dates and remaining in the top tier of New York jazz for over 60 years. Cobb turned 90 in January, and he celebrates this weekend in a quartet featuring Peter Bernstein on guitar, Tadataka Unno on piano and John Webber on bass.

212-576-2232, jazzstandard.com PEDRO GIRAUDO TANGO QUARTET AND SOFIA TOSELLO at Joe's Pub (Feb. 1, 9:30 p.m.). Giraudo is an Argentine bassist and composer who reinforces his love for tango with a mastery of Western classical and jazz vocabulary. He sometimes performs with a full orchestra, but he's just as dazzling with his quartet -- the group that appears on his 2018 album, ""Vigor Tanguero,"" which won a Latin Grammy for best tango album. Also on the bill is Sofia Tosello, a vocalist whose last album, ""Lluvia Fue"" (""Chamber Tango""), presents its own distinctive take on the tango tradition, mixing old songs and new.

212-967-7555, publictheater.org MARIA GRAND QUARTET AND JOEL ROSS GOOD VIBES at Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola (Feb. 5, 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.). Grand, a tenor saxophonist, and Ross, a vibraphonist, are two of the most-buzzed-about young players on the New York jazz scene -- each with their own sleek, sanguine take on mainstream jazz. They're also frequent collaborators, and at Dizzy's on Tuesday they will split the bill, with Grand's quartet (the vocalist Fay Victor, the bassist Kanoa Mendenhall and the drummer Savannah Harris) starting things off, and Ross's group (Mendenhall on bass, Immanuel Wilkins on alto saxophone, Jeremy Corren on piano and Jeremy Dutton on drums) playing the second set. Tickets for each performance are sold separately.

212-258-9595, jazz.org/dizzys HYPNOTIC BRASS ENSEMBLE at the Blue Note (Jan. 31-Feb. 3, 8 and 10:30 p.m.). The brass-band tradition is naturally associated with New Orleans, but Hypnotic proudly espouses its Chicago roots. With less marching-band thunder and more hip-hop swagger than, say, New Orleans's Dirty Dozen Brass Band, this eight-piece ensemble mixes the influence of hip-hop, soul and gospel into a coolly grooving sound. And Chicago's deep legacy as a cradle of experimental, Afrocentric jazz is never far away: All but one of Hypnotic's members is a son of Kelan Philip Cohran, a patriarch of Chicago's creative black music scene, who died in 2017.

212-475-8592, bluenote.net EIVIND OPSVIK OVERSEAS AND SNARK HORSE at Nublu 151 (Feb. 6, 9 p.m.). A Norwegian-born bassist with a big, dark tone and precision chops, Opsvik writes music with an irreverent intensity, adhering to no single style and showing little interest in the mannered formality of so much progressive jazz. Much of his latest album, the fifth installment of his ""Overseas"" series, boasts the rugged conviction of rock music and the tangled melodic momentum of a fugue. At Nublu 151, he shares the bill with Snark Horse, an all-star group of improvisers playing short, nervous melodies that they repeat and deconstruct. Snark Horse appears here in quartet form with Matt Mitchell on piano, Ava Mendoza on guitar, Matt Nelson on tenor saxophone and Kate Gentile on drums.

Sports,A Virtual N.F.L. Draft Might Be a Back to the Future Moment,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/sports/football/nfl-draft-virtual-past.html,"Ernie Accorsi, the former general manager of the Baltimore Colts, Cleveland Browns and Giants, remembers attending his first N.F.L. draft in 1969. He expected to enter a grand, ornate ballroom filled with titans of the game: Vince Lombardi, Paul Brown, Don Shula. Instead, he walked into a tiny New York hotel conference room and did not recognize anyone other than the league commissioner, Pete Rozelle, who stood against a wall. ""Rozelle didn't even have a chalkboard,"" Accorsi said. ""He was writing the names of drafted players in Magic Marker on a big white sheet."" Gil Brandt, whose 28-year career as a Dallas Cowboys draft guru began in 1960, recalled recently that early in his career some teams considered a thick roll of quarters an essential draft tool.

""If they needed a tackle, someone would go to the hotel lobby pay phone and start using the quarters to call college coaches,"" Brandt said. Conversations hinged on a question: ""You got anybody good at tackle?"" On Thursday, the N.F.L. will hold its first virtual draft. Nearly every person involved in the process will be working remotely via video conference to comply with physical distancing guidelines. The usually splashy television broadcast will lack its normal pageantry. In its place, player selections will be announced, almost comically, from the basement of the current N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell. To modern fans, the scene might seem like a throwback, the N.F.L. turning back the clock to 1970. The truth is, the N.F.L. draft 50 years ago was much more primitive, cruder even than today's football fans can imagine. (More on that later.) And while this year's draft may look as if it has gone back in time, the essentials of this annual, much ballyhooed event will largely remain the same, behind the scenes, at least, as it has for decades.

Yes, there will be an unprecedented dependence on technology to get picks delivered on time, which could cause a few nerve-racking glitches. But 255 former college football players will be selected, and as in every other recent draft, teams will have relied on a deep reservoir of accumulated player data to make those choices. Along the way, there will be stupefying picks that prove to be spectacularly prescient and seemingly safe selections that end up embarrassing busts.

But first, to go back to the future. There was one chief reason the draft in the early 1970s was almost primeval: The event was held about 10 days to two weeks after the Super Bowl. That scheduling had a profound effect, leaving no time for a scouting combine, player workouts, medical examinations or many face-to-face interviews with prospects. ""There was little time to prepare, and in a sense that wasn't bad,"" Accorsi said. ""You had no choice whatsoever but to draft by production."" Members of the college all-American team dominated the early rounds, which was often constructive. In the 1975 draft, for example, three of the top six picks were future members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. But from 1967 to 1976, the draft also had 17 rounds, so plenty of players with less decorated careers were drafted, even if general managers sometimes found those players by scanning articles in preseason college football magazines. The fundamental basics of the modern draft started to take shape in 1976 when the event was moved to late spring. It was dropped to 12 rounds the next year. By 1980, ESPN was televising the proceedings, and in the 1990s, the number of rounds was reduced to seven. When lucrative television contracts turned the N.F.L. into a cultural and business monolith, teams had the money to hire hundreds of college scouts and personnel directors. Prepping for the draft became a year-round endeavor, an obsession within a sport rife with compulsive personalities.

That is why, even in a pandemic, N.F.L. teams will not be heading into Thursday's draft in disarray despite the interruption of their predraft routines by the spread of the coronavirus. ""Teams have had the information they need for months and months,"" said Scott Pioli, a former N.F.L. front office executive with six teams who helmed player personnel duties for eight seasons with the New England Patriots, during which time the team won three Super Bowls. ""There have been regular, frequent meetings about this draft since December. At each interval, general managers have read every report on every player that matters.""

Pioli does believe, however, that the atypical circumstances of this year's virtual draft will be somewhat unnerving to N.F.L. general managers because they are accustomed to being surrounded by advisers in one room as selections are made. ""They're used to having to turn to their left or right to get information,"" Pioli, now an N.F.L. analyst for CBS Sports HQ, said. ""They won't be in their normal comfort zone."" Unforeseen technological lapses that might thwart communication between team staffers or between teams and league officials during the draft also continue to be a substantial concern for general managers and their staffs. Peter O'Reilly, an N.F.L. executive vice president, insisted Friday on a conference call with reporters that the league had prepared multiple layers of contingencies to prevent communication breakdowns. Team executives can also be granted a one-time clock extension if a technological issue arises. ""Even if there are glitches, if you have several phones -- your phone, another family member's phone -- there are ways to be ready, and I'm sure teams have thought that out,"" he said.","Without the ability to gather in one location for a big televised production, this year's draft may rely on the bare essentials.",76e42005-8f4f-5b59-95d3-ef4583fab0db,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/22/sports/20nfl-pastrdraft/merlin_82415879_c42b7a7e-7608-4b75-8400-348af6d5bc23-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=5c8227344eb772a76f0396d8c5dd0e1847282669f672753928b05406138998c6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Pete Rozelle, then the N.F.L. commissioner, did not have to worry about bells and whistles at the 1970 draft at the Belmont Plaza Hotel in Manhattan.",76e42005-8f4f-5b59-95d3-ef4583fab0db,N24News/imgs/76e42005-8f4f-5b59-95d3-ef4583fab0db.jpg,9
Sports,"For Curry, a Return Home Shows He Is Where He Belongs",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/sports/basketball/golden-state-warriors-stephen-curry-charlotte-all-star.html,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Stephen Curry was about 25 minutes into a news conference here on Saturday afternoon when a magician who goes by the name Jibrizy sidled up to the dais to do a card trick. Curry, the Golden State Warriors point guard, seemed impressed. ""That was nice, big fella,"" Curry said. ""That was crazy. Y'all see that? Did y'all see that? What's your name, boss? Jibrizy? Nice to meet you, man. Fire. You're fire. That's what's up."" Lots of weird stuff tends to happen during N.B.A. All-Star weekend, and a cameo by Jibrizy was no exception. But it was also the rare instance when the spotlight left Curry, if only for a moment, in the run-up to the weekend's flagship game on Sunday. Curry, a six-time All-Star and two-time most valuable player who has already coaxed Golden State to three championships, is used to lots of attention. But he relished his return to Charlotte, where he grew up to become perhaps the greatest shooter of all time -- and where he is still revered.

Curry was not so great Sunday, but that was not the point. He finished with 17 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists for Team Giannis in a 178-164 loss to Team LeBron in the All-Star Game, which was a defense-free postscript to a weekend that was a Curry family affair. ""Incredibly fond of the family,"" Commissioner Adam Silver told reporters. ""They seem to be the first family of Charlotte, at least this week."" For much of his trip home, Curry was accompanied by his father, Dell, who spent 10 seasons playing for the Charlotte Hornets, and his mother, Sonya, who drilled a half-court heave after the family helped refurbish a community center. It was probably the family's splashiest shot of the weekend.

Curry had less success in Saturday night's 3-point shootout, where he was joined by his younger brother, Seth, who plays for the Portland Trail Blazers. Stephen Curry made it to the championship round before losing to Joe Harris of the Brooklyn Nets. But Curry had also found time to return to Davidson College, his alma mater, where he clambered into the student section to celebrate an 80-72 victory over St. Joseph's on Friday night. ""The energy in the building was unbelievable,"" Curry said. ""It's surreal every time I get to go back there."" The following afternoon, Curry swayed in a sea of reporters (and at least one magician) as he fielded a wide-ranging mix of questions. What did it mean to him to be back in Charlotte? ""It's kind of overwhelming to be honest,"" he said. ""I've got to be like the Energizer bunny.""

During warm-ups for Sunday's game, Curry mimicked a game of volleyball with Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid, posted up a ball boy so that he could take an entry pass from Oklahoma City Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook, made chitchat with bigwigs who were courtside and jacked his share of 30-footers. Most of them went in. All-Star weekend is a circus, but it is still basketball, after all, and Curry has unique skills. He is assembling another spectacular season, even if his work has been overshadowed by fellow All-Stars like James Harden of the Houston Rockets, Paul George of the Thunder and Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo. Curry has been so consistently good for so long now -- and his team so dominant -- that perhaps some of the novelty has worn off. It is unfair, of course. If his feats feel too familiar, consider his production this season: 28.6 points, 5.2 assists and 5.1 rebounds per game while shooting 48.8 percent from the field and 44.4 percent from 3-point range. He missed 11 games with a groin injury but spent part of that time gluing the Warriors' locker room back together after Kevin Durant and Draymond Green had a big dust-up. The friction stemmed from Durant's looming free agency, which has been a steady hum of distraction for the Warriors. But Curry has been a stabilizing force for his team -- and even for the league.

With a contract that runs through the 2021-22 season, Curry has not had to face pressing questions about his future. He is committed to the Warriors, and the Warriors appear committed to him. He is a throwback in an era dominated by player movement, the current face of which is Anthony Davis, the All-Star center who recently requested a trade from the New Orleans Pelicans. So many other stars face uncertain summers, too: Durant, Kyrie Irving and Kawhi Leonard among them. But Curry has his niche in Northern California, even if his roots are in North Carolina. After Sunday's game, he described trying to persuade his father to move to the Bay Area, where Curry has settled in with his wife, Ayesha, and their three children. Dell Curry, who is a color commentator for the Hornets, always says no. ""This is where home is for him,"" Stephen Curry said. And for Stephen Curry, the whereabouts of his father seem to be the only player movements on his mind. Curry said he was unconcerned with free agency this summer and the potential departures of his teammates. ""That's a part of the business,"" Curry said. ""But the great teams, the great players, they stay in the moment and they understand what's in front of them."" And so, after taking a weekend to dip into his past, Curry returned to looking ahead. The journey goes on.","An All-Star weekend in his hometown, Charlotte, N.C., affirmed the growth, and greatness, of the Golden State Warriors guard.",fec5ea20-a64e-5406-bbe1-8e5080dd59d0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/19/sports/19allstar-web1/19allstar-web1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=f600b26690c49a9aab6634800d5a75fdeea1d2028dee985da15257f17e886235&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry has made the N.B.A. his playground, but during All-Star weekend, where he grabbed the rim on Sunday after a dunk, he was really in his element.",fec5ea20-a64e-5406-bbe1-8e5080dd59d0,N24News/imgs/fec5ea20-a64e-5406-bbe1-8e5080dd59d0.jpg,9
Travel,"On Small Ship, Ocean Life (and Other Passengers) Are Up Close",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/20/travel/cruises-safari-quest.html,"Most of the boat is asleep when we pass through Ballard Locks in Seattle shortly before midnight. Blotchy, heavy clouds are stacked like anvils above a purple horizon. Stars wink here and there, a promise of a clearer night. Salmon still run freely between the fresh water of Lake Washington and the salt water of Puget Sound, through a fish ladder integrated within the locks. Two workers from the Army Corps of Engineers man the locks this evening; they wave and throw lead lines to our crew working the deck. Capt. Tate Grant sticks his head out on the bridge wing to monitor our 120-foot-long, 234-ton vessel as it is pulled closer to the dock, fenders given the lightest of kisses. We drop 20 feet over 20 minutes to match the water level outside the locks. Then they open, and we are released. So began my first cruise -- a weeklong stint on the 22-passenger Safari Quest as it made its way around the moody, mercurial Pacific Northwest islands off the coast of British Columbia last fall. Seattle fell away as we entered the inky dark of Puget Sound, our wake slicing away at 45-degree angles from the hull as we picked up speed.

If a typical cruise ship is a floating city, this was a floating small town, owned and run by Seattle-based Un-Cruise Adventures, which specializes in small-boat exploration to places larger cruises can't go. The company's biggest vessel carries just 88 passengers. The Safari Quest seemed like the right kind of boat for me, because I wanted the main attraction to be outside, not on board. For my mom and her three sisters -- two of them retirees and the other two not far behind -- big, traditional cruises are a great way to get around. They love the nonstop entertainment, the traveling without the hassle of travel, the towers of food. Me? I fear splashy spectacles. I worry about claustrophobic, sedentary boat life with thousands of others. I think of death by all-you-can-eat buffet. Here are more fascinating tales you can't help but read all the way to the end.
* None
* Getting Personal With Iman. The supermodel talks about life after David Bowie, their Catskills refuge and the perfume inspired by their love.
* A Resilient Team for a Broken Nation. With the Taliban in control, what, and whom, is Afghanistan's national soccer team playing for?
* The Fight of This Old Boxer's Life Was With His Own Family. A battle among   Marvin Stein's family over his fortune broke out, and he suddenly found himself powerless to fight for himself. There is truth in these expectations, even on a cruise so diminutive. Almost every traveling resident in my floating small town was upward of 60 and retired. The food was spectacular and abundant. There was an open bar. The real surprise was that boat life could be as active as I wanted it to be, despite the range of ages and abilities on board. The size of this vessel -- just 29 feet wide, with four levels from top to below decks -- means you can't help but be immersed in the people and workings of the boat that's taking you places. And I found that I quite liked small-town life in this place, where everyone knows your name.

Anita from Michigan was also a frequenter of cruise vessels, and she liked the small ones best. ""With the 2,000-passenger boats you're on for a week and you get off before you've ever been in the fitness center because you never could find it,"" she confided one evening as we waited for cocktails by the bar in the boat's wood-paneled main salon. ""It's a more anonymous experience."" Then there was Joan, who actually hailed from the same tiny Massachusetts town that my husband grew up in. She enjoyed our little yacht -- just 19 passengers on this departure -- because it suited her and her husband's different travel styles. ""Doug likes the outdoors and the hiking, but I like the Four Seasons,"" she said on the second-floor stern deck, her feet up, as we gazed out over the glassy waters that surrounded us. ""I like to sit on the boat and be taken care of. They let me do that here."" It sure didn't hurt that the views from the boat were varied and excellent. From Vancouver Island, we headed up into the tiny inlets along the Sunshine Coast of British Columbia; when the tide rushes out through particularly slim channels on this part of the coast, white-water rapids and whirlpools form. A huge volume of water heads back to sea at Skookumchuck Narrows -- some 200 billion gallons on a 10-foot tide. Here, we jumped in a couple of skiffs to get a closer look at the region's rich intertidal life. While speeding up to track a bald eagle, one of our boats nicked the edge of a whirlpool and nearly lost a passenger overboard. A sea lion frolicked in the current, its big brown head like a bear's, laughing at us. Up on a little island there was a haul-out point for seals. There they lay, dozens of little brown lumps shiny as slugs. Seals are shy. We cut the engines hundreds of yards out, but still their heads came up and a handful of them fell clumsily into the water. A few of the pups were fuzzy and spotted. On land they wiggled comically on their tiny forefins. But in the water the seals were smoothly confident, fluent in the medium. They swam circles around us and disappeared. Though it was late in the season, there were still tangles of bull kelp in the water. We gathered up a long, whip-shaped frond to sample this varietal of seaweed (tasting notes: crunchy and herbaceous, and not as salty as I'd imagined it to be). Pam Navis, our expedition leader, sliced the bulb at one end of the frond to release the carbon monoxide within, then played the sawed-off tube like a mini-trumpet. What came out sounded something like the call of a dying moose.

At the edge of another rocky island not far from the haul-out, fat purple sea stars -- a constellation of them -- sprawled along the intertidal zone, gorging themselves on tiny mussels. We held the hand-size stars in our palms and watched their guts work to spit out the shells. Down in the clear, dark water, I spotted a little moon jellyfish, its milky white outlines pulsing like an accordion over the violet stars and crescent shells below. A moon and stars, suspended in a tidy little universe below the water. Some facts about our little boat and its character-filled crew: Mr. Grant, the captain, has been with the company for 13 years. He still gets seasick. He lives in Seattle and his favorite itinerary is summertime in Alaska. The expedition leader, Ms. Navis, spent 20 years in Maui and knows everything about humpbacks; she plays the harmonica and once sang in a two-woman band that opened for Hootie and the Blowfish and the Doobie Brothers. Mike Morrissey, the night pilot, drove a tugboat around San Francisco Bay and helped build the new section of the Bay Bridge. Monica Barber, the boat's flame-haired hotel manager, always brings her fiddle and plays Irish jigs and reels; she also makes a mean, extra-spicy Bloody Mary. Lucas Campbell, the engineer, had a habit of talking thermodynamics with Rob Buccigrossi, the mate, while the two were on deck. The Safari Quest is Mr. Campbell's favorite boat to work because it's so small. ""It's a baby boat,"" he said with affection. ""Everything that needs fixing I can hold in my hand."" Huddled in the narrow galley with the tattooed pastry chef, Justin Rightwood, I learned that he was a sponsored semipro skateboarder and BMX biker when he was 12. Joe Pienody, the talented head chef, turned out a string of gorgeous dishes from that tiny kitchen: delicate pork belly, perfectly seared wild Chinook salmon, tender spears of grilled asparagus and carrots. He is a die-hard sports fan and weeps a little inside every time he misses a football game while at sea. But, like the rest of the crew, he does love to be at sea. And why wouldn't he? At lunchtime in Jervis Inlet, a humpback whale surfaced lazily, spouting and waving a fin. Later that day, after we rode the slack tide through the Malibu Rapids -- a narrow, shallow channel safely accessible only to even a small boat like ours every six to eight hours -- we dropped anchor at Princess Louisa Inlet, a glacier-cut gorge with provincial marine park status and a series of waterfalls spilling over 5,000-foot granite canyon walls. It's one of the most glorious spots in this part of British Columbia, and a place where we could stand-up paddleboard, kayak and hike. The water there was so calm and clear that we could spot the blood-orange frills of a lion's mane jellyfish pulsing under the surface, and a seal's wake from several hundred yards out. At sunset in Princess Louisa, the crew built a bonfire in a wood pavilion onshore, at the foot of Chatterbox Falls. Stands of old-growth hemlock and cedar were draped with dewy lichen. The hemlocks' treetop canopies reminded me of velvety moose antlers. Pam and Lucas began to strum their guitars and sing; Monica mixed margaritas for the rest of us, then took out her fiddle to join them. Accompanied by music, the wood smoke wafted dreamily through the slanted late-afternoon light.

I spent the next two days stand-up paddleboarding the waters there and in the Harmony Islands, 26 miles south of Princess Louisa as the crow flies. There's a quiet magic to paddling around an endless expanse of mirrored water for hours, with just a seal or two tailing you and the occasional barking sea lion for company. But the most electrifying experience of all was made possible one evening only once the sun had set. In complete darkness, I joined a couple of crew members at the back of the boat. We jumped, whooping, into the 45-degree water. I did it for one reason: I had always wanted to make phosphorescent snow angels. Clouds of glowing bioluminescence bloomed around us as we treaded water -- a kind of aquatic light show for observers on deck. When I finally climbed out of the water and vigorously rubbed my arms, sparks flew. Glancing up, I saw the starry froth of the Milky Way, that night a mirror for the glitter of the undersea world. Later, as we cruised back down the Strait of Georgia toward the San Juan Islands and Seattle, we came across two humpback whales, a mother and her calf, swimming and spouting along. We paused to watch them as they rolled and played, diving down to show us their distinctive tail patterns, as unique to them as our fingerprints are to us. Then the mother leapt into the air, breaching just to the right of our bow. This was my type of spectacle, and my type of crowd. What comes of being confined to a boat with 20-odd people for seven days? By the end of the week, we were all busybodies in one another's lives. We had nicknames and huddled in cliques. On a phone call with my husband near the end of the cruise, he marveled at the fact that we had all had enough time to form posses and gossip about one another. The intensity of time spent with the others on this boat was familiar to me. Perhaps it was like the first week of college, but for retirees. At the end of the trip, we exchanged email addresses and photos, promising to stay in touch, to do this all again sometime. It turned out that a couple of guests didn't have to say goodbye, or unpack. They were already headed straight to their next cruise. Un-Cruise Adventures destinations include Alaska, Central America, the Galapagos and Hawaii; the seven-day Pacific Northwest yachting itinerary starts at $3,695 a person.","On a vessel this small, you can't help but be immersed in the people and workings of the boat that's taking you places.",5dce3e62-14af-5655-9d95-1921876c89c7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/20/travel/20SMALLCRUISE/20SMALLCRUISE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=8139b79eccfa8f6734f2ce58a4e4eed7142dbba313ac5963d54834f8b358f833&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The 22-passenger Safari Quest in the Princess Louisa Inlet in British Columbia.,5dce3e62-14af-5655-9d95-1921876c89c7,N24News/imgs/5dce3e62-14af-5655-9d95-1921876c89c7.jpg,4
Fashion & Style,"With These Rings, She She Weds",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/fashion/collina-strada-wedding-new-york-fashion-week.html,"It would have been hard to predict that Ms. Taymour, whose label has been enthusiastically taken up by a fringe of the young, restless and digital, would answer the call with a white wedding -- albeit one in which the bride wore cargo pants, a ""chap skirt"" train affixed with a buckle at the waist and a T-shirt pierced by nipple rings, connected with a chain. It was an appeal to love, Ms. Taymour said, in an age of anger (however well justified). No groom or second bride appeared. She was marrying her ""higher self."" ""Sologamy,"" Ms. Taymour called it: To thine own self be true!

Ms. Taymour's presentation was the bridal procession: the flower girls (ringers for ""The Shining"" twins), the club-kid friends, the family elders, a squirming baby (whose crushed-velvet-covered diaper matched the crushed-velvet suit of the model toting him down the runway). The ceremony was performed by Bunny Michael, a musician and self-proclaimed higher-self healer whose prescriptions include a fair number of New Age memes.

""I vow to love myself, every day, and never fear that this may be misconstrued as vanity,"" said the bride, Sasha Frolova, a young actress with a modified Dorothy Hamill bob, reading from a page fetched from her cargo pocket. ""I vow to do so that I may give back love and support those around me, and provide and inspire for those within reach, tangibly and intangibly through my honesty.

Automobiles,Miracle Baby's Burden: New Family to Support,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/automobiles/autoreviews/12saab-9-5.html,"THE familiar two-digit name of the 9-5 gives no clue to the car's troubled birth  or to the near-miraculous survival of Saab. This all-new sedan needs a more evocative name. The Saab Lazarus, perhaps, or the Kummback. With Pontiac and other brands already felled by the bad economy, it is only natural to hope that the Swedish automaker can stick around. Yet as the revived company's first would-be savior  with the 9-4X crossover and a new smaller 9-3 sedan to follow  the 9-5 reveals a handsome face but feet of clay. Saab had been one of the brand castaways of the recession, cut loose by General Motors with few white knights in sight. But just when Saab seemed to be sunk, the owner of a speck-sized Dutch maker of exotic cars  Victor Muller of Spyker  stepped in to acquire the Swedish automaker for $400 million, including $74 million in cash. Now comes the hard part: reviving a proud company whose sales have plummeted  so sharply that some consumers assume Saab is dead and buried. Both the new management and some journalists place all of the blame on G.M. and its distracted stewardship.

These critics seem to have forgotten where Saab was headed before G.M. threw it a lifeline. Even before 2000, when G.M. fully absorbed the brand, the Swedes were getting their herring creamed by hungrier, nimbler luxury brands. Despite game-changing threats from Lexus and other fast movers, Saab clung to an obsolete strategy, offering scant model choices with limited appeal beyond a core group of fans. These few models were updated roughly every dozen years as rivals revamped their entire lineups in half that time, leaving Saab behind the competitive curve. The complacency continued under G.M. The last-generation 9-5 was a tired soldier after 13 years. And G.M. failed to give Saab the luxury crossovers that the company desperately needed. Ultimately, even loyal Saabistas got tired of being taken for granted. Mr. Muller's mission, as he sees it, is to win back owners who've fled from Saab  to Audi far more than to any other brand, he said in a recent interview  by recapturing the Scandinavian character that had leaked away during the G.M. years. Yet even as G.M. and Saab have divorced and squabbled, they still have to get along for the sake of the children: The new 9-5 is handsomely, unmistakably a Saab, yet under the skin the car remains a G.M. creation to its core. It shares its front- or all-wheel-drive platform with the solid Buick LaCrosse. Its engines and other components can be found in several G.M. models. That's not a major issue in itself. But a car born in such corporate turmoil bears the scars of separation. While G.M. was fighting for its life  and trying to unload its foster child  it abandoned development work on future Saabs, said G.M. executives and engineers deeply involved in its projects. In Detroit, the 9-5 sat untouched and unfinished for well over a year.

Unfortunately, the 9-5 leaves just that impression, of a car whose finishing touches were hastily applied or even overlooked. It's a car you want to love, with a swept-back elegance that makes a refreshing contrast to trendy or generic Asian luxury cars, and to the ubiquitous Germans that dominate the midrange luxury market. The 9-5 also feels especially roomy, front or back. But a key missing ingredient is chassis refinement, that alchemist's blend of a smooth ride and taut control that characterizes the 9-5's main rivals, including the Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, Cadillac CTS and Infiniti M37. There's much to admire in the 9-5, beginning with its graceful lines. Huge front air inlets and a wrapround cockpit nod to Saab's aircraft roots. The roofline falls sweetly, buttressed by strong, sweeping rear pillars. And where so many rivals conform to a wheels-at-the-corners approach, the Saab strikes a more classic profile with a long tail that extends far beyond the rear axle. The 9-5 looks modern yet stately. Like the best Saabs of the past, it's an individualist's car, with a timeless character that should look as good a decade from now as it does today.

This Saab is also huge, roughly seven inches longer and three inches wider than the previous 9-5. At 197 inches, the Saab stretches past any car in its class, with a spacious back seat that puts a 5 Series or CTS to shame. The cabin shows more good design. It is so attractive and comfortable that you nearly overlook the mediocre materials or the many bits obviously borrowed from the G.M. parts bin. Saab's offbeat Nordic charm shows in driver's gauges with green needles that glow as threateningly as Darth Vader's light saber; matrix-style air vents and a ""night panel"" button that blacks out most of the instrument panel. A keyless pushbutton replaces the key switch at the traditional location on the console  no more fishing for dropped keys between the seats. The seats are handsome and supportive. The controls, which initially seem haphazard, are smoothly functional. The car's Detroit-derived hardware is a mixed bag. The intuitive G.M.-based touch-screen navigation system is one of the most appealing interior features. Some switches, however, would look at home in a Chevy. And while the metal-ribbed shifter for the 6-speed automatic transmission looks good, it clomps noisily through its gate like a Clydesdale on a hardwood floor. I drove an Infiniti M37 back-to-back with the 9-5, and the contrast of the cabins was unavoidable. The encompassing richness of the Infiniti, to name just one competitor, makes a luxury statement that leaves the Saab wanting.

Again, it's the underripe nature of the car that draws criticism. I drove the 9-5 Aero, with its solid Haldex all-wheel-drive system, that starts at a heady $48,390. With options including the navigation system and 19-inch wheels, the price reached $52,360. On the plus side, the 9-5 delivers respectable fuel economy for its size: 16 miles per gallon in town and 27 on the highway. Saab offers a far more affordable Turbo4 model, starting at $39,350 with front drive and a turbocharged Ecotec 4-cylinder. Options on that version include a 6-speed manual transmission and all-wheel drive. But on paper, the Turbo4's numbers raise concern: how smartly can a 220-horsepower G.M. engine lug around a two-ton luxury sedan? For now, the 300-horsepower 9-5 Aero is powered by G.M.'s turbocharged 2.8-liter V-6, an engine that's competent but no prize winner. As mentioned, the Saab shares its platform with the LaCrosse, whose critical praise is well-earned  in part because the Buick costs barely $30,000, not $50,000. To its credit, the 9-5 smooths out the turbo's uneven power delivery. The 9-5 gathers power in a linear, pleasantly silent rush. There's just enough grunt to make the Saab feel not-so-slow; Car and Driver magazine recorded 0-to-60 acceleration at 6.3 seconds. But many competitors are downright fast. Weight is one issue: at 4,365 pounds the 9-5 Aero is the class heavyweight. The Saab's transmission can be slow and stubborn, even when you're changing gears with the the paddles on the steering wheel. There's plenty of tire grip, but so little steering feel that the 9-5 doesn't transmit much confidence or pleasure at high speeds. The Saab's boomy ride is its weakest point. A selectable system dials up three modes  Comfort, Intelligent and Sport  to adjust parameters including the suspension, throttle, transmission and stability control system.","The new 9-5 is handsomely, unmistakably a Saab, but a car born in corporate turmoil is likely to bear the scars of separation.",ad5e2526-47f0-52f1-a0d4-f5214532220d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/12/12/automobiles/WHEE-2/WHEE-2-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=268&w=600&s=3379cb8d2308ecd68afbfb73e5a827f5ccbc8c9061ee93804fdd81180e3cf3fa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"ADOPTED Saab's new owner revived development of the 9-5, which G.M. had put in limbo during its financial crisis.",ad5e2526-47f0-52f1-a0d4-f5214532220d,N24News/imgs/ad5e2526-47f0-52f1-a0d4-f5214532220d.jpg,23
Economy,U.S. Consumer Spending Was Stagnant in April,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/29/business/economy/29econ.html,"Consumers earned more income in April but they also spent less, according to government statistics released on Friday, raising some questions about the pace of the recovery. The Commerce Department said that personal income rose by $54.4 billion, or 0.4 percent, in April. Spending increased $4 billion, and was essentially flat. Both were less than economists had forecast. In March, personal income increased 0.4 percent and spending 0.6 percent, based on revised estimates. Savings, on the other hand, grew; the rate rose to 3.6 percent in April from 3.1 percent in March. Personal savings were $398.5 billion last month, compared with $342.7 billion in March. Paul Dales, the United States economist for Capital Economics, said the report puts a ""modest dent"" in the outlook for consumption growth in the second quarter

""I think consumption has some near-term momentum. The figures are disappointing but they are far from being a disaster,"" he said. According to the report, spending decreased on such nondurable items as utilities and groceries. Spending on durables, like cars or household appliances, was flat, compared to 3.7 percent up in March. Guy LeBas, the chief fixed-income strategist for Janney Montgomery Scott, said one factor that might have contributed to the drop in April was an early Easter, which sent spending for that holiday into the March calculations. Second-quarter consumption is still likely to grow at an annualized rate of about 3 percent, Mr. Dales said, suggesting that the consumer sector is strong enough to weather any adverse effects from the recent financial market turmoil. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index for May was revised to 73.6 from a preliminiary figure of 73.3. It was up from 72.2 in April but even with the figures for February and March.

Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR Inc., said the outlook for consumer spending growth, which typically fueled the economy, would primarily be determined by the pace of the recovery in the job market and the confidence of consumers. Mr. LeBas, of Janney Montgomery Scott, said, ""Jobs growth or spending? That's the critical question raised in the wake of April's solid income growth and disappointing spending numbers."" The economy has slowly added jobs this year  290,000 in April  but with more than eight million jobs lost since the recession began in December 2007, any recovery is expected to take time. While analysts caution against drawing any conclusions from the April data, they took note of the increase in the savings rate. Mr. Dales said that in the past, many people thought they could rely on the increasing value of their houses as a form of savings. ""Now they are returning to old-fashioned, good old cash under the bed, or in the bank, really,"" Mr. Dales said. ""And I think we will probably get a trend toward that over the next 12 months.""",The flat reading raised concerns about a possible slowing in the recovery from the recession.,884a49f5-7a79-57ac-9cfd-2e4827c3aa21,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/05/29/business/29Econ01_span/29Econ01_span-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=330&w=600&s=222608fd8f78ace8a28ff24bc20fd57877866b4722f1f21789b97ed8d34c2e74&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"A Coach retail store in Dallas.

Books,"Dick Bruna, Author of Miffy Books, Is Dead at 89",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/books/dick-bruna-dead-miffy-creator.html,"AMSTERDAM -- Dick Bruna, the Dutch illustrator and children's book author who created one of the most recognizable characters in the world, a sparely drawn round little white rabbit known in English as Miffy, died on Thursday at his home in Utrecht, the Netherlands. He was 89. His death was announced on his website. Mr. Bruna's work has been translated into more than 50 languages in 85 countries and has spawned a Miffy cottage industry, with videos, television spinoffs, toys and other products with the character's likeness sold worldwide. ""He's the most translated author in the Netherlands, except for Anne Frank,"" said Agnes Vogt, a children's book specialist at the Dutch Foundation for Literature, ""and in that sense he's one of the most important not only illustrators but also authors that the Netherlands has ever had."" Mr. Bruna wrote and illustrated 124 books for children over six decades, beginning with ""De Appel"" (""The Apple"") published in the Netherlands in 1953. The book, which tells the story of life from the perspective of an apple, has never gone out of print.

None of his characters, however, became as famous as Miffy, a cheerful little bunny who enjoys the small moments of happiness that go along with small-scale adventures: a trip with her family to the zoo, throwing a shiny ball around with friends, visiting a farm or a museum or celebrating her birthday. Mr. Bruna was inspired to create Miffy after spotting a rabbit running in the woods on a trip he had made to the countryside. He introduced her in his second book, naming her by shortening the Dutch word for rabbit, konijntje, to Nijntje, which is what she is called in the Netherlands. That book, ""Nijntje"" (or ""Miffy""), published in 1955, was followed by ""Miffy at the Zoo,"" both in a small, square format -- about six inches by six inches -- designed to be manageable for little hands. He went on to write 30 more Miffy books. His children's books were not immediately successful, however, said Marja Kerkhof, managing director of Mercis Publishing, which has published all his books. ""At the time he started, it was very common to have large books for children with many illustrations,"" she said, ""and they would be far more busy and more complicated -- books that were more interesting from the parents' point of view.""

Mr. Bruna insisted on simplicity -- just a few illustrations and short texts -- as well as the small size. ""He felt it was exactly the right size for young kids,"" Ms. Kerkhof said. He was born in Utrecht on Aug. 23, 1927. Wanting to be a fine artist, he lived for a while in Paris and studied at the Rijksakademie (the State Academy of Fine Arts) in Amsterdam but did not finish, frustrated, he said later, that he could not paint or master perspective. But he held on to his artistic ambitions, even in the face of skepticism: When he sought to marry Irene de Jongh in 1952, her father asked him how he planned to support her. To earn a steady income he went to work for his father's publishing company, A. W. Bruna and Zoon, designing posters, promotional materials and book covers for detective novels, some of which featured silhouetted detectives against simply colored backgrounds. His children's books were a side project at first. And he did marry Ms. de Jongh, who survives him, along with three children and six grandchildren. Mr. Bruna never became the fine artist he had originally wanted to be, but his work has nevertheless been recognized as part of the Dutch canon of art and design. ""Bruna very much continues a Dutch tradition which we call the 'klare lijn' -- you could translate it as the clear line, or you could just call it simplicity,"" said Taco Dibbits, director of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which in 2015 organized an exhibition devoted to a half-century of Mr. Bruna's art and graphic designs. ""You see that's he's part of a tradition going from Pieter Saenredam through Vermeer to Mondrian."" During his time in Paris, Mr. Bruna was influenced by the bold lines and two-dimensionality of Henri Matisse and Fernand Leger, Mr. Dibbits said. He also used primary colors and clear lines favored by members of the Dutch de Stijl movement, a pared-down, abstract aesthetic heralded by artists like Mondrian and the designer Gerrit Rietveld.

""He eliminates anything that's not essential from the face of this little rabbit until it's really reduced to the absolute minimum,"" Mr. Dibbits said. ""And he does the same for the text of his children's books. He uses a language that's not simple or stupid, but he reduces to the bare essentials."" About his own work, Mr. Bruna once said, ""I spend a long time making my drawings as simple as possible, throwing lots away, before I reach that moment of recognition."" He added, ""I leave plenty of space for children's imagination."" The result is a series of ""Zen-like"" tales, Ms. Vogt said, ""and that's also part of the universal appeal."" ""There are many, many copycats who have tried to reproduce the style over the years,"" she added, ""and though it seems so simple, it's very hard to get the same feeling."" Miffy became more famous than the man who invented her: Mr. Bruna is sometimes referred to as ""Miffy's father."" For a brief time in the early 2000s, New York City tourism officials enlisted the little rabbit as a ""good will ambassador."" His work is particularly popular in Japan, where Miffy books and merchandise have also found an adult market. Until he had a stroke at 84, Mr. Bruna had continued working six days a week, waking up every morning at 6 o'clock, biking to his studio before 8, and eating lunch at home every day with his wife, Ms. Kerkhof said. He retired in 2011.",The Dutch writer and illustrator was known for children's books depicting a sparely drawn round white rabbit who gained a worldwide following.,41e0b7f8-577a-5058-97f3-3ea27511308f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/21/arts/21BRUNAobit/21BRUNAobit-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=3f2aff8239142859b5bb3d9aafb11f2f4e762bee6d9acb7f03474bc6f74cb42c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Dick Bruna in 2005 at the opening of an exhibition devoted to his Miffy books in The Hague.,41e0b7f8-577a-5058-97f3-3ea27511308f,N24News/imgs/41e0b7f8-577a-5058-97f3-3ea27511308f.jpg,13

It's a position he seems to relish, or at least to remind you of.

Marni has always been eccentric. Mr. Risso's innovation is to make it kiddy-ish, too.

""A well-to-do boy falls in permanent vacation"" read the notes he distributed at the Marni show as a kind of mission statement. Not a bad description of a job in fashion, despite all the work that goes into lifting these baroque, often-six-figure spectacles off the ground.

For the Marni show on Saturday, Mr. Risso designed the collection and, with Marni's team, the space, including the leather, wood and pool-float benches and the darkened, black-curtained passageway through which guests passed to enter.

It put you in mind of Alice falling down the rabbit hole, an impression amplified by the collection itself, whose ballooned and shrunken shapes and sizes (""XS, M, L: his game of sizing is absent-minded,"" the notes said) conjured Lewis Carroll's heroine's becoming 10 inches tall after taking her tasty potion.

Food,A Sauce That Tastes Like a Good Sweater Feels,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/dining/lamb-ragu-recipe.html,"This fast take on a ragu uses ground lamb and cooks in less than an hour.



Alison Roman's quick lamb ragu is warm, luxurious and something you'll want to keep close on very cold days.

For reasons that are both tangible and psychosomatic, there is truly nothing like the middle of February to make you feel as though you won't make it through winter. But instead of letting the early sunsets slowly drain my serotonin, I am starting to resist the gloom and finding joy in wintering, focusing on the things that are truly best this time of year: not leaving the house once on a Saturday, wearing your best apres-ski look even if there is no skiing and eating a ridiculous amount of pasta -- to be specific, the indulgently meaty, rich and saucy kind of pasta, topped with so much cheese.

This recipe is very much that: an extremely lamby, tomatoey sauce that tastes like how a very good sweater feels. And like a very good sweater, it's not the kind of thing I'm trying to work into my summer lifestyle, so I celebrate the cold weather by eating as many bowls of the stuff as possible.

This sauce, which comes together in about 45 minutes but tastes like it took 90, isn't technically a ragu, a word that inherently implies long-cooked. That said, ""meat sauce"" doesn't quite have the same ring to it (or any ring, really), so I'm going to stick with calling it ""quick ragu,"" letting that qualifier speak for itself. It's also a very basic sauce, and so I urge you to leave the optional anchovies in: They play an important role in complementing the flavor of the lamb and add a complexity usually achieved by a long cook time (and for anyone who is anchovy-averse, no, you don't really taste them).

From there, if you feel the need to sass it up by adding a pinch of fennel seeds to the onions, a splash of red wine to the tomatoes or a mess of freshly chopped herbs at the end, I will not be offended. (The beauty of a good recipe is often in its flexibility, no?) Other options for an upgrade include mixing up the meat (pork and lamb!) or serving the finished pasta with a spoonful of seasoned ricotta dolloped on top, which will surely have you wishing it was winter all year round. (O.K., maybe not.) While it would be easy to consume this sauce day after day over bowls of polenta or different pasta shapes (it loves a thick noodle, like fettuccine or pappardelle), it also freezes well -- meaning this seasonal delight could carry you deep into winter. But by then, we'll be trying to lean into spring, so I say eat up while you still can.","Alison Roman's quick lamb ragù is warm, luxurious and something you'll want to keep close on very cold days.",d796d82c-b3a3-56d5-b225-f6a054604ce3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/20/dining/20Roman1/merlin_147497019_c8ecb378-f7e4-43fd-a2da-35d7e2b560de-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=1877c8ba3af68d9347ac20119a94ae6d1400a603f03a188a7ebf008cf308afd1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,This fast take on a ragù uses ground lamb and cooks in less than an hour.,d796d82c-b3a3-56d5-b225-f6a054604ce3,N24News/imgs/d796d82c-b3a3-56d5-b225-f6a054604ce3.jpg,17

That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. Good morning. Purim starts Saturday night, a commemoration of Esther's smart actions, two and a half millenniums ago, before her king. She vanquished the evil Haman and saved the Jews. It's a big party, lots of food and wine and singing: hamantaschen time. Later on, among a different congregation: Phagwah, the Hindu spring festival of the Indian diaspora in and around the Caribbean, known in India as Holi, the festival of colors. Me, I'll make Julia Moskin's recipe for banana beignets and contemplate nirvana. What are you cooking this weekend? I don't care if it's 10 degrees out, or raining. It's been a few months, and I want to eat grilled ribs, barbecued chicken, a fine stack of grilled romaine lettuce heads lashed with a dressing to recall Caesar's.","We've got three ways to spend the days — Purim, Phagwah or project cooking — and recipes and ideas to accompany them.",5ef68d6b-f4bb-521d-ba89-20bbb8e99493,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/28/dining/28COOKING-EGGSBENEDICT1-copy/28COOKING-EGGSBENEDICT1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=fc91bad5072a9fc181053ff3308c60845a101734567737699a4612af33bf4ba0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Eggs Benedict.,5ef68d6b-f4bb-521d-ba89-20bbb8e99493,N24News/imgs/5ef68d6b-f4bb-521d-ba89-20bbb8e99493.jpg,17
