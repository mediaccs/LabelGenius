Dance,The Top Male Dance Performances of 2014,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/14/arts/dance/alastair-macaulays-top-male-performances-of-2014.html,"Many performances in 2014 took me where I had not gone before. Here I recall just 10 male dancers and the dates, in chronological order, when the scale of their achievement dawned on me. April 11, London: Andrew Scott Andrew Scott is not a dancer but an actor, and is as well known on screen (he's Moriarty in the TV series ""Sherlock"" and will play the villain in the next James Bond movie) as he is onstage. In Simon Stephens's drama ""Birdland"" at the Royal Court Theater, he played a blithely destructive rock star, perpetually low key, except for a few, brief scene-change moments when he stood center stage and danced. With rapid changes of weight from foot to foot -- his pelvis, torso and heels shifted seismically, and he hurled gestures with full force -- electricity poured through and from his entire body.

April 24 and 25, Berkeley, Calif.: Aaron Loux The Mark Morris Dance Group is a wonderful ensemble; how can any one dancer here be more remarkable than another? At the world-premiere performances of Mr. Morris's ""Acis and Galatea,"" the hilarious dance quartet that closed Act I was a highlight, with Aaron Loux its most infectiously engaged participant. The same proved true in New York, at the Fall for Dance world premiere of Mr. Morris's ""Words"" in October. Though Mr. Loux is not the most physically remarkable member, he's even more Morris than the others: immediate, witty, intense.

May 3, Sarasota, Fla: Logan Learned As the virtuoso Blue Skater in ""Les Patineurs,"" Logan Learned gave the most uncannily perfect performance of the Sarasota Ballet's four-day Frederick Ashton Festival. Mr. Learned, a short Californian, has this role's spinning turns, giddy jumps and speed; he also brings it a childlike fantasy and innocence. How can Americans master this British choreographer's intricate, filigree works? The question is best answered in Sarasota. May 9, Philadelphia: Alexander Peters Trey McIntyre's new work ""The Accidental,"" performed by Pennsylvania Ballet, is all male-female duets -- until its conclusion, an unusual male solo. The dancer is Alexander Peters, a remarkable 5-foot-6 redhead, who has danced lead Balanchine roles and created parts by several choreographers. In his ""Accidental"" solo, he seems to open his heart even while changing direction, as if questioning himself and laying himself bare.

May 12, New York: Herman Cornejo On the gala opening night of American Ballet Theater's season, Herman Cornejo's performance as the Peruvian in Leonide Massine's ""Gaite Parisienne"" demonstrated the kind of brilliantly high-energy, half-cartoon characterization that many of us thought long gone from the world. Where does such mastery of style come from? Mr. Cornejo, now absolutely in his prime, has long been Ballet Theater's most remarkable and versatile artist -- and its most admirably mysterious. May 17, New York: Russell Janzen What was it about young Russell Janzen -- then a corps dancer still unknown to some of New York City Ballet's followers -- that helped him deliver the best-ever account of a Balanchine role older than he is? The ballet was ""Robert Schumann's 'Davidsbundlertanze' "" (1980); he played its anguished, Romantic protagonist. Tall and broad shouldered, Mr. Janzen, with an adult authority beyond his years, deepens the world onstage by the power of his absorption in it.

June 28, Memphis: Phyouture Altavien Hart, who dances under the name Phyouture, is a mid-teenage exponent of Memphis jookin. Like other Tennessee performers of this bravura form of hip-hop, he does heart-stoppingly audacious and individual footwork and feats of balance (in sneakers, often on point) while dancing solos to loud rap. As I watched him in a jookin ""battle"" in Memphis, I felt that grace itself was being radically redefined.

July 25, New York: Dylan Crossman When I played hooky from the Bolshoi Ballet one night to watch Pam Tanowitz choreography at Lincoln Center's open-air Damrosch Park theater, Dylan Crossman, in a solo from ""The Spectators"" (2013), proved more compellingly poetic than anything in the Bolshoi's season. Mr. Crossman -- a member of the final Merce Cunningham Dance Company, from 2009 to 2011 -- has a strange leprechaunlike vitality. This Tanowitz solo made him look like the young Merce Cunningham: free, bold, exploratory. Sept. 19 and 20, New York: Rob Fordeyn Although Trajal Harrell's seven-part series, ""Twenty Looks or Paris Is Burning at the Judson Church,"" at the Kitchen, was a pretentious and half-baked failure, it featured four masters of vogueing: Rob Fordeyn, Thibault Lac, Stephen Thompson and Ondrej Vidlar: style in excelsis. The androgynous Mr. Fordeyn grew only more fascinating: tall, willowy, with stunningly arched feet, but also with force, darkness, even violence. Oct. 28, New York: Jorge Torres For some tango devotees, Jorge Torres, a senior Argentine tango dancer based in New York, has long been the very embodiment of this genre. Whole new aspects of this irresistible form opened up for me when at last I saw the exquisite Maria Blanco dance with him at the Dardo Galletto Studios. Mr. Torres is commandingly elegant; his secret lies in the seductive passion of his phrasing and partnering. MORE ON THE YEAR IN DANCE:","From London to California, with stops in New York, Philadelphia and New York, Alastair Macaulay's list of 2014's best male performances.",c13bf580-0acf-511a-ae33-e1c6a24d1cfa,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/14/arts/14MACAULAY1/14MACAULAY1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=401&w=600&s=2003a4fce7fffca13ebf7495a08dbb3191db712c1e97ef4776c1ea7e67bfb710&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Andrew Scott (in the play ""Birdland,"" in London).",c13bf580-0acf-511a-ae33-e1c6a24d1cfa,N24News/imgs/c13bf580-0acf-511a-ae33-e1c6a24d1cfa.jpg,6
Opinion,"In Netflix's 'Hollywood,' One Movie Fixes Racism. Hooray!",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/opinion/netflix-hollywood-ryan-murphy.html,"I was 12 years old when I first fell in love with the dreams spun by ""classic"" Hollywood: the myth of simpler times, the seductive glamour of men and women who often spoke in a quasi-British accent. For a time, I longed to live in that period. But as they say, you live and you learn -- and what I learned was that in reality, there was little glamour in being a black girl anytime from the 1930s to the 1960s. Still, ""Hollywood,"" a splashy, star-studded Netflix mini-series set in the late 1940s and created by Ryan Murphy and Ian Brennan, is aimed squarely at my 12-year-old soul. In this alternative universe, the fictional Ace Studios serves as the backdrop for a series of history-making acts of good will on the part of straight white people, resulting in the production of ""Meg,"" a feature film penned by a gay black man, starring a black actress and directed by a half-Filipino filmmaker, whose wild success solves racism in show business for good. Hooray!

That's one way to describe it. A blunter question also came to mind as I watched: What if a handful of straight (and ostensibly straight) white people were actually willing to risk their careers and reputations in order to create opportunities for the underrepresented? Both counterfactuals are played out in ""Hollywood,"" but they rest oddly alongside one another -- one is playfully subversive; the other a retread of simplistic progressive logic about how to combat systemic oppression. The show's appeals to the benevolent hearts and minds of ""good"" people are maddeningly naive. I devoured each episode anyway.

This plot mechanism reaches its eye-roll-y apex in the fourth episode, in which Patti LuPone's Avis Amberg takes over as head of the studio after her husband suffers a heart attack. She doesn't want to cast the black actress Camille Washington (Laura Harrier) as the lead, even as she agrees that Camille's screen test is the best. Avis is worried about the inevitable backlash -- that she could bankrupt the studio, that southern theaters will boycott a movie featuring a black actor in a nonsubservient role. Enter none other than Eleanor Roosevelt, who delivers a speech about ""what it might mean to a dirt poor little black girl living in a shanty in some cotton town"" to see someone like Camille onscreen. Roosevelt goes on to say that she's lost her faith in government's ability to enact change, but what Avis and her colleagues do -- make movies for the masses -- is the real deal. The scene is just like the ""message pictures"" from that era: earnest, unintentionally self-aggrandizing, wildly oversimplifying complex real-world issues like racism.

The final episode takes a bold and bonkers leap in its rewrite of history, making ""Meg"" not only a box office hit but also an Oscars sensation -- Avis, Camille and others, including Anna May Wong (cast in a supporting role in ""Meg""), all take home awards. Additionally, Archie Coleman (Jeremy Pope), the gay black screenwriter, walks the red carpet hand-in-hand with a young, then-unknown Rock Hudson and announces him as his boyfriend, thanking him during his acceptance speech. Is it possible for a fantasy to be too absurd? ""Hollywood"" is emphatic about what ""Meg"" is able to achieve for those like Anna May and Avis. Within just a year, it kick-starts a wave of major films starring women and people of color and ""racial protests across the country simply melt away,"" according to a fictional newsreel. In real life, Miyoshi Umeki's win for best supporting actress for the 1957 film ""Sayonara"" didn't instantly lead to significantly better parts for her or her peers. Halle Berry's best actress win for ""Monster's Ball"" didn't suddenly open doors for other black women in Hollywood. That's because history has proved that even for those who have been sympathetic to the causes of the marginalized, there's only so much power they are willing to concede. It's how we end up with, say, the North capitulating to the bruised egos of the side that lost the Civil War, or politicians catering to the religious right in the race to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment.

This has been as true of the entertainment industry as it has been of government -- which is why it remains a big deal when a ""Black Panther"" or a ""Crazy Rich Asians"" or a ""Wonder Woman"" gets made, much less finds success. Those films were borne of hard-won fights for equality. And yet I keep coming back to the happy endings of the ""Hollywood"" characters. There is something to be said for the show's fluffy confection of ahistoricism when it's not indulging in myths of racial reconciliation and movies-as-changemakers. The happy resolutions conjured up by message films from the ""Hollywood"" era almost always benefited straight white people and no one else. Here is a fantasy set in the past where women, people of color and queer characters ultimately win, too. Yes, the Avises of the world are able to pat themselves on the backs for doing the right thing. But Archie, Camille and Anna May also get to pursue their dreams and see their success open doors for others. They survive, they flourish, they are happy. A part of me can't ignore what it feels like to see this Technicolor spectacle populated by these faces and experiences, to see the 1940s depicted through a 2020 lens -- browner, less sexually repressed, more women calling the shots. ""Movies don't just show us how the world is, they show us how the world can be,"" says one character in ""Hollywood."" The line feels straight out of a Judy Garland-Mickey Rooney vehicle, in which small-town kids conspire to put on a show (sometimes with blackface!). Instead, it comes from an ambitious, if faulty, series that dares to imagine an assortment of characters conspiring to make a movie with a half-Filipino man, a gay black man and black and Asian women in 1940s Hollywood. The show is willfully naive and laughably self-satisfied. But as far as dreams go, it's also progress.

Television,"'Atlanta' Season 2, Episode 2: Miraculous Waves",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/arts/television/atlanta-season-2-episode-2-recap.html,"Earn and Alfred are allergic to winning. Why else would they go to such great lengths to avoid it? Even with cash in hand and opportunities placed at their feet, they each find a way to screw up success. If he had his druthers, Al would just as soon make drug-dealing his day job, relegating rap to a side gig. Unfortunately, he's got major supply chain problems these days. At the top of the episode, his drug supplier -- or ""plug"" -- abruptly ends their 10-year work relationship by robbing him of a knapsack full of cash. It was the most deferential gunpoint exchange ever, starting off with a plaintive ""Ay, my fault,"" followed by sincerities like ""Appreciate it,"" and ""I'd give you a ride home, but ..."" The guy may have succumbed to the wicked ways of Robbin' Season, but that's no reason to abandon his home training. It turned out to be the first of three botched weed transactions this week, and it soured Al's mood for the next day's meeting at a streaming music company. But then, that meeting was doomed anyway.

The company is called Fresh -- a term that hasn't been synonymous with coolness in decades -- and it's filled with a mostly white millennial staff and stereotypical start-up fixtures (a Ping-Pong table, turf-covered walls, organic, gluten-free snacks). Earn feigns optimism but he clearly doesn't want to be there any more than his cousin does. The string of Fresh scenes -- visually both brighter and whiter than is usual for ""Atlanta "" -- jab at the fact that even as the music industry has gotten a high-tech makeover, the practice of exploiting black youth culture persists. There's the visual of a young rapper energetically performing on top of a boardroom table as executives stoically appraise him. There's the audio guy prompting Al to be ""more cool"" and to act ""like you're at a party"" (code for ""sound more black"") as he's recording promo spots. Then there's the scene in which Earn's just mills about the office, munching Cheerios, until he realizes every other person is wordlessly watching him. Once they know he's onto them, they quickly spark back into motion. This speaks to a feeling known all too well by those who've experienced ""the only one in the room"" syndrome. For those who haven't: Being the lone minority in, say, a work environment or classroom can create an unsettling sense that people are silently observing your every move, no matter how mundane. Here the episode writer Stephen Glover brings that nagging notion to life. The visit ends when Al storms out of an excruciating Tiny Desk Concert-style performance, after most employees can't be bothered to leave their cubicles to watch him rap ""Paper Boi."" It's his second loss in less than 24 hours, and there are more to come. Back on the illegal grind, Al tries his luck with a second plug only to have the star-struck dealer post a stealthy, potentially incriminating photo of him onto Instagram. The third is a seemingly cool hippie bro who soothes Al's nerves with a potent smoke-out session and promises of discounted pricing. Alas, everything goes left when he loops Al into a group text with his ""gangster"" girlfriend, who turns out to be one of the millions of vanilla twentysomethings hunched over a guitar, trying to go viral with an acoustic rap cover. One video clip of her chirping his eponymous single is all it takes for Al to defenestrate his cellphone and burn that bridge, too.

After his terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad trapping day, Al retreats to his living room comfort zone. Nearly everyone he had encountered were fans -- from music biz types to dealers to fellow musicians -- but each compliment seemed to grate his nerves raw. Networking isn't really his jam and he's not one for schmoozing, social climbing or, interpersonal communications with anyone outside his inner-circle. So why, exactly, is such an introvert courting fame? (And is Paper Boi reflecting all or just a fraction of Donald Glover's own reported mercurial moods and ambivalence about celebrity?) If Al's considering changing careers, now might be the time, because his manager is a liability. That dog-breeding scheme Darius concocted in Season 1 proved to be surprisingly lucrative, making Earn $4,000 richer. It's a windfall that would certainly make his daughter's mom, Van, happy and might offer a solution to his persistent lodging problem. Alas, grown-up thoughts like these never get a chance to take root, because Al's new couch-surfing ex-con friend, Tracy, lures him into a fool's gold charge card scam. ""You give me the cash and I'll double it on any gift card you want,"" Tracy promises. Off they traipse to the mall, where Earn's real-world responsibilities are doomed to take a back seat. The plan has failure written all over it, of course. (It may have been viable had a visionary like Darius pitched it.) How hard did you facepalm when Earn slumped back into the apartment bearing empty pockets and only a fraction of his mall haul? He quickly descends into the doldrums with Al, smoking weed and watching TV. But their respite is interrupted by an incredibly catchy Yoo-Hoo ad starring Clark County, the rapper who, by contrast, made all the right impressions during his overlapping visit to the Fresh offices. On the TV screen, he's filled with the kind of animated swagger that disgusted Al and left Earn awe-struck. Here again, was the kind of career-spiking opportunity that Paper Boi would've turned down flat. He never would've received such an offer though, because his manager isn't even savvy enough to level up from burning demos onto blank CDs. While those two remained in their respective ruts, Tracy made plans to move up in the world. He had a job interview and was filled with gumption, despite his ex-convict status. First things first: He had to make sure his hair was perfect.

Tracy's wave cap expertise is where the episode gets its name, ""Sportin' Waves."" Watching these guys sit around sharing laughs and potshots about a hair care phenomenon that's pretty unique to black men -- without expounding on its nuances for the benefit of a wider audience -- felt like witnessing a secret handshake. Assured that his grooming was on point, all Tracy needs is the right pair of shoes to make his interview look complete. At the mall, he doesn't even bother using his own gift card scam (which should've been a warning to Earn), preferring to employ a brazen five-finger discount. (""They got a no-chase policy; they can't stop me."") Armed with Earn's crib notes on how to talk to ""white folks"" -- basically, ""don't call them 'white folks'"" -- he was ready to put his best foot, and coif, forward. The comically exaggerated finished product was equal parts Moe Howard and early-career Brian McKnight, glistening like a unicorn mane as Tracy expertly code-switches his way through the interview. (Earn would've been proud.) Ultimately, though, being the ""King of Waves"" -- nay, the ""Prince of Tides"" -- is not enough to land him the job. Was he actually the victim of racism, as he alleges on his way out? Was he stigmatized by his record? Maybe he just lacked the appropriate qualifications (none of us ever learned what the job was, anyway). Whatever held Tracy back, it certainly wasn't those ""miraculous waves."" They were baked to perfection.
* That pet dragon that mesmerized Al at the hippie's place is the second prominent reptile this season, for those keeping score.
* Anyone else notice the TV when Earn returned from the mall? If you blinked, you might've missed the fake Dodge Charger commercial from last season's ""B.A.N."" episode.",This week found Earn and Alfred stuck in their ruts as Tracy made plans to move up in the world.,496c20db-cdc3-5e6f-b08b-5d5ea1f5236e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/08/arts/08atlanta-recap/08atlanta-recap-slide-LLS9-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=6312947c48d698edaeeb0d43b162ef9242971cc39bd0a6fd9aa07c1b5fe6a411&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Brian Tyree Henry, left, and Donald Glover in ""Atlanta.""",496c20db-cdc3-5e6f-b08b-5d5ea1f5236e,N24News/imgs/496c20db-cdc3-5e6f-b08b-5d5ea1f5236e.jpg,3

# As Fiat sales lag in China, Sergio Marchionne, chief executive of Fiat and Chrysler, seeks to build Jeep Cherokee sport utility vehicles there.

# The number of long-term car loans spanning 73 to 84 months has risen more than 25 percent over the last year, according to a report by Experian Automotive. Such loans now make up about 20 percent of car loans, whereas 61- to 72-month loans - once considered very long - now account for more than 40 percent of the automotive loan market. (USA Today)

# Toyota outsold General Motors again this quarter, and financial analysts say the automaker's success, along with the successful sales records of other large Japanese manufacturers of late, can be attributed to the yen-weakening fiscal policy of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan.

Economy,Tax Tactics Threaten Public Funds,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/business/economy/multinational-tax-strategies-put-public-coffers-at-risk.html,"When the European Commission charged this week that Ireland's sweetheart tax treatment of Apple amounted to an illegal corporate subsidy, the company said that it had done nothing wrong. Apple executives might have added that whatever they did, they were not alone. Corporate tax strategies intended to minimize global taxes, by hook or by crook, are by now standard practice. Google and Facebook move money through Ireland to lower their taxes. Starbucks uses the Netherlands, a practice that is under review by Europe as well. ""The commission picked up a case which is quite common in terms of tax planning,"" said Pascal Saint-Amans, who runs the Center for Tax Policy and Administration at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the policy advisory organization of the world's advanced nations. The question is whether this sort of strategy -- as common to multinational companies as filing a tax return every year -- can truly be stopped. What hangs in the balance is whether governments can continue to tax corporations beyond the barest minimum. Or whether globalization will make such taxation all but impossible.

""A combination of greater economic integration and more income accruing to intangibles like intellectual property, which by nature are hard to locate, does raise profound questions for the future of taxation,"" said Lawrence H. Summers, Treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and President Obama's first chief economic policy adviser. ""It is a significant problem for the revenue capacity of states and an immense problem for their capacity to maintain progressive taxation."" If corporations can continue to evade taxation -- using strategies like sham transactions between phantom subsidiaries to shift profits to the lowest tax jurisdictions and costs to where taxes are highest -- the burden of public finance will land almost entirely on the shoulders of ordinary workers, the only link in the economic chain that can't move. ""Consider a superstar banker, an enormously valuable pharmaceutical patent, a terrific entertainer, an assembly line worker and a teacher. Of all those things, which is the least mobile?"" asked Mr. Summers. ""A tax system that can't reach the mobile is a tax system that is going to burden working people."" Some scholars -- including Robert B. Reich, who served as Labor Secretary during the Clinton administration and now teaches at the University of California, Berkeley; and Greg Mankiw of Harvard, who was former chief economic adviser to President George W. Bush -- have proposed abolishing the corporate income tax, replacing it with direct taxes on shareholders. But it is highly doubtful that the American political system could raise taxes on dividends, capital gains and upper incomes enough to compensate for the lost revenue from business. Rich taxpayers also have their own sophisticated tools to shield income, including parking money in tax havens around the world.

Mr. Saint-Amans said he feared that without the corporate income tax, income taxation would fall apart entirely as the wealthy could avoid taxation by becoming companies, inserting several corporate layers between themselves and their money. Nobody has a confident grasp of the scale of corporate tax avoidance. Corporate tax revenue in the United States today amounts to some 2.6 percent of total economic activity, roughly the same as it did in the early 1980s, when the latest wave of globalization took off. Across the 34 O.E.C.D. nations, corporate tax revenue actually grew from just above 2 percent of G.D.P. in the 1960s to some 3.7 percent in 2007, before the financial crisis walloped companies around the world. These figures can be misleading, though. In the United States, corporate taxes have remained flat despite a sharp increase in corporate profits, which today take the highest share of national income since the government started measuring them in the 1920s. Profits have similarly risen in other industrial countries around the world. Plus, there is plenty of suggestive evidence that profit-shifting has become a core pillar of corporate strategy.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions. In 2012 the Irish subsidiaries of American multinationals generated $120 billion in profit, according to United States government data, eight times as much as their German subsidiaries. Subsidiaries in Bermuda generated $82 billion, four times as much as subsidiaries in Mexico.

Americans seem to be the most nimble dodgers. The United States has a higher statutory corporate tax rate than Europe, but according to a recent study by Reuven S. Avi-Yonah of the University of Michigan Law School and Yaron Lahav of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, European multinationals effectively pay a higher rate than their American counterparts. The problem is global. In 2010, according to the International Monetary Fund, Barbados, Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands received more foreign direct investment combined than Germany or Japan. The British Virgin Islands was the second-largest investor in China, after Hong Kong. These fictions are possible because most of the money flows through shell corporations that employ nobody and produce nothing. Can these problems be fixed? ""I think so,"" Mr. Saint-Amans said. ""The golden age of 'We plan aggressively and pay taxes nowhere' is over."" The European Commission's deployment of competition policy to go after dubious tax breaks in Apple's case is a novel and potentially powerful strategy, which could be applied to many other arrangements. Governments in both the rich and poor world are fed up, Mr. Saint-Amans said. Having spent the last few decades drafting rules to prevent double taxation, they are now terrified that they have built a system of double nontaxation instead. Governments that turned a blind eye to the tax avoidance of their multinational champions to give them a competitive edge against foreign rivals are now under enormous pressure from voters to prove that it's not only workers and dupes paying taxes.

The O.E.C.D., Mr. Saint-Amans says, has no business telling countries what tax rate they should impose. If the Irish can fund their government charging companies 12.5 percent, that's their business. Still, he trusts new rules developed by the O.E.C.D., if broadly adopted, could put an end to common avoidance practices, like parking valuable intellectual property in tax havens or having subsidiaries in high-tax jurisdictions, where interest is deductible, borrow from subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions where interest is not taxable. Under enormous pressure from the rest of the world, tax havens might even repent. The Irish, he said, have been mulling tightening the rules unilaterally, concluding that the bad blood generated by the arrangements outweighs the modest number of jobs that they lure and the scant tax revenue that these artificial investments leave in the country. There are reasons, however, to remain cautious that the world's tax collectors can get ahead of its corporate tax strategists. The trend in the United States, if anything, is going in the opposite direction. Despite the Obama administration's new rules to prevent so-called corporate inversions, where companies move their tax residency abroad, companies like Burger King and Medtronic are still dropping their American ""citizenship"" to reduce their tax liability. Ireland has based its entire development strategy on becoming a low tax base for the multinationals of the world. And until the financial crisis walloped its banks, it had been successful. As Mr. Summers pointed out, putting a stop to the shell company shenanigans doesn't automatically put an end to international tax competition. In fact, it might make it worse.","If global corporations can continue to evade taxation, the burden of government financing could fall disproportionately on ordinary workers.",1de5c156-9cea-5971-9fdf-b6a4ce9bf35c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/02/29/business/eduardo-porter/eduardo-porter-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2014&h=900&w=600&s=e0f5bc829638945c9b9699e41305b013e6fb17053b1c05c78d9b02c6891b47ef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Eduardo Porter,1de5c156-9cea-5971-9fdf-b6a4ce9bf35c,N24News/imgs/1de5c156-9cea-5971-9fdf-b6a4ce9bf35c.jpg,8
Real Estate,Westchester Home Sales Drop to Recession-Era Lows,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/realestate/westchester-home-sales-drop-to-recession-era-lows.html,"The coronavirus severely hampered the spring sales market for homes in Westchester County, with the number of sales dropping by more than 27 percent in the last three months compared to the same period last year, the largest decline recorded in 11 years.

Home sales in Westchester fell off significantly in April and May, but picked up once brokers were allowed to start showing homes in person again in June. Sales volume also declined farther north in Dutchess and Putnam Counties, according to quarterly reports released by Douglas Elliman.

The number of contracts signed in Westchester jumped from 801 in May to 1,215 in June, an increase of 53 percent. The flurry of post-lockdown activity in June is a good sign, but the total is still 15 percent below the number for the same time last year.

Style,Chris Christie Makes Cameo Video For Montana Democrat (By Mistake),https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/style/chris-christie-cameo-montana.html,"Chris Christie, the former New Jersey governor, on Thursday became the latest Republican politician to be fooled into making a campaign video on behalf of a Democrat. Mr. Christie is one of many of Mr. Trump's current and former associates available for hire on Cameo, an app that allows users to commission personalized videos from minor -- and increasingly major -- celebrities. The video, which cost $200, was framed as a jovial message to a person named Greg, who Mr. Christie was prompted to encourage to return to New Jersey, Greg's former home.

Mr. Cooney's staff ordered up the Cameo video on Wednesday, and Mr. Christie turned the assignment around quickly, delivering it that evening. (The celebrities available for hire on Cameo are told who to address in their video, but usually do not know the identity of the recipient.) ""Think about everything we got back here,"" Mr. Christie says in the video, cajoling ""Greg"" to return to New Jersey. ""We got Taylor ham. We've got Bruce Springsteen. We've got Jon Bon Jovi. We've got the Jersey Shore. We've got the boardwalks."" ""We've got all that stuff back here that is waiting for you, but more than anything else, Mike and your whole family, they want you back here,"" he added. Then he jokingly threatened to retrieve the addressee himself, if he wouldn't return willingly. ""I don't think that's what you want, Greg,"" Mr. Christie said.

On Thursday, Mr. Cooney posted the video on Twitter, framing it as a ""special message"" for his opponent. Mr. Christie responded by telling NJ Advance Media that he had been hoodwinked, and he tweeted about the incident, emphasizing that he was on Cameo for the benefit of a New Jersey-based charity. ""Shame on @CooneyforMT,"" he said in his tweet, stating his support for Mr. Gianforte. (With five days to go, the Montana governor's race is tight; in a poll released on Wednesday, Mr. Cooney and Mr. Gianforte were tied.) The idea to prank Mr. Christie originated with Mr. Cooney's campaign manager, Brad Elkins, who spotted the former governor on Cameo. The move was meant to emphasize a message that Mr. Cooney's campaign has been pushing: that Mr. Gianforte -- who was born in California and spent his early adulthood in New Jersey -- is an outsider, with outsider values. ""It's been a fun day,"" said Matt Fidel, a campaign spokesman. Other Trump associates have been susceptible to pranks like the one organized by Mr. Cooney's staff. In the last several months, Rob Flaherty, the digital director of Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s presidential campaign, has commissioned Cameo videos from one of Mr. Trump's former campaign managers, Corey Lewandowski, and Sebastian Gorka, a former White House adviser, as well as the president's longtime friend Roger Stone. Each video was made to pump up ""Joey"" (Mr. Biden) before his debates with Mr. Trump. Mr. Flaherty tweeted the first clip, from Mr. Lewandowski, on Sept. 29; the one from Mr. Gorka, on Oct. 15; and the final one, from Mr. Stone, on Oct. 22. (The second debate was canceled after a disagreement over Covid-19 safety protocols.)",The former New Jersey governor is the latest Republican politician to be tricked into making a video for the opposing party.,75376db1-0710-5215-b533-610216092641,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/01/style/29cameo-owns-01/oakImage-1603998940903-facebookJumbo.png?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=bc1b537b3b905ddc6a5982727409a8d26a2a36a1ea5bdab7acb1da8812c04e93&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Chris Christie, in a still from a Cameo video supporting a Democratic candidate for governor in Montana.",75376db1-0710-5215-b533-610216092641,N24News/imgs/75376db1-0710-5215-b533-610216092641.jpg,15
Theater,Review: Taming 'The Taming of the Shrew' Under a Tent,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/theater/taming-of-the-shrew-hudson-valley-shakespeare-review.html,"GARRISON, N.Y. -- When last we dropped in on Kate, Petruchio, Bianca and the gang, they were contestants in some kind of surreal beauty pageant, riding around on bikes and making no sense. That's what ""The Taming of the Shrew"" had come to in a 2016 Shakespeare in the Park production directed by Phyllida Lloyd. To be fair, those were end times for ""Shrew""; no one knew what to do anymore with a comedy that turns on the humiliation, torture and probable rape of an ""irksome brawling scold."" (In Anne Tyler's novel ""Vinegar Girl,"" released that same summer, Kate tames herself.) Ms. Lloyd evidently hoped that an all-female staging -- the men were played by women in drag -- would pluck the stinger from the wasp, to paraphrase Petruchio. Instead, the sweaty desperation of the effort exacerbated the problem and made it look intractable. Two summers later, with the #MeToo movement having exploded in the interim, it seemed time to say that ""Shrew,"" for all its perverse pleasures, should be left alone, in either of that phrase's meanings. Do it as written and live with it, or don't do it at all.

Not that its intent is so clear. ""Shrew"" is a shaggy, youthful play -- Shakespeare was still in his 20s when he wrote it -- and can be pruned into various shapes. In Ms. Cooper's staging, the topiary figures of a man and a woman that at times flank the dirt floor of the playing area, connecting it to the riverine flora beyond, suggest the shape she is after. For her, ""Shrew"" is a parable of discovery in which two misfits find, beneath the social construction of love, its natural contours. Aside from the usual heavy trimming, the director has taken only a few textual liberties to get there, mostly at the end. The infamous speech in which the tamed Kate says she is ""ashamed that women are so simple"" now finds her ashamed that ""people"" are. Otherwise, Ms. Cooper reorients the play through her psychological framing of the action. Like Waze for Shakespeare, she offers an alternative route through the usual terrain. The key to her interpretation is that Kate and Petruchio are (as she writes in a program note) ""radical souls."" Kate (Liz Wisan) is not a termagant for nothing; she is protecting the slight freedom she has as a wealthy man's daughter. Though instantly drawn to Petruchio, she's too smart to trust him, or even herself; hostility is not her flesh but her armor. Likewise Petruchio (Biko Eisen-Martin) is instantly drawn to Kate, not merely to her money. (When he calls her ""the prettiest Kate in Christendom"" he is not, for once, being sarcastic.) The ""taming,"" which is at first a sexy, mutual game and only becomes grim when he fears he is losing, is thus not a punishment but a test. Petruchio wants to know whether Kate can truly love him despite her natural defenses. He does not so much ask ""Will you obey me?"" as ""Will you soften your pride enough so that I can make you happy?""

And she, in essence, asks the same. Their common enemy is marriage as it is traditionally arranged in their time -- and, often enough, in ours. Ms. Cooper's production shows us exactly what this means in its treatment of younger sister Bianca (Britney Simpson), who cannot wed until her older sister does. The scene in which suitors vie for her hand by trying to top one another's financial offers is staged as an auction, complete with paddles. When Bianca does marry, even though it is to the suitor she most wanted, the girlish glee of independence drains from her at once.

What Kate models is thus not subservience to a man but a remaking of love through humility instead of humiliation. She no longer tells just wives to ""place your hands below your husband's foot,"" but all spouses of any gender to do so, beneath ""your partner's."" The taming must be mutual and voluntary; you have no doubt that, should Petruchio try to spank her again, she would walk off into the landscape -- as she does after their first encounter in this production -- with her middle finger aloft. That landscape does part of the work here. Like all of the festival's offerings, ""Shrew"" -- running in repertory with ""Richard II"" and ""The Heart of Robin Hood"" -- benefits from its environs. The awesome view through the semicircular tent openings of the Boscobel grounds, Constitution Marsh and the Hudson River beyond suffices for the eternalities; the production can afford to be more improvisatory, frolicsome and of our time. Ms. Cooper sees to that with a mostly young, eight-person cast, closer to the ages of the characters than we usually get. Ms. Wisan is an ideal Kate for this production, whip-stinging and whip-smart but deeply interested in men. And Mr. Eisen-Martin provides plenty to interest her, with his collegiate gamesmanship and boyish good looks, still slightly unformed. When love overtakes him unexpectedly you believe, as if for the first time, that he does what he does ""in reverend care of her."" These adjustments still can't answer all the problems that ""Shrew"" keeps raising. (Worse almost than starving Kate is Petruchio's coming late to the wedding she has finally decided to relish.) And Ms. Cooper's carnivalesque staging -- stuffed with comedy bits, golden oldies, pop culture references, cross-dressing, sprightly costumes (by Asta Hostetter) and the ""Kiss Me, Kate"" song ""Tom, Dick or Harry"" sung fetchingly by Bianca -- sometimes seems like it's trying too hard. Still, with the sky behind the actors slipping from pink to mauve to purple as the story itself grows darker, it's hard not to have rosy feelings about this ""Shrew."" It nearly makes you believe that within the same oldfangled men and women we've known for centuries, new people may really be ready to emerge.","An hour north of New York City, a new production of Shakespeare's impossible comedy finds a sensible way to respond to the #MeToo moment.",926eac24-898b-5c0a-b29e-ae273ee18b3d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/20/theater/20hudson-valley/20hudson-valley-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=f51eec7107d5f8be8cedfcaaeeaad592b35449e09490c3d13119f544353f0e46&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ms. Wisan plays the role of Kate, a woman protecting the slight freedom she has as a wealthy man's daughter.",926eac24-898b-5c0a-b29e-ae273ee18b3d,N24News/imgs/926eac24-898b-5c0a-b29e-ae273ee18b3d.jpg,10
Books,Tragicomic Fiction That Masquerades as an Extended Lawyer Joke,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/books/review/the-mutations-jorge-comensal.html,"Among other things, ""The Mutations,"" a feisty first novel by the Mexican writer Jorge Comensal, is a dark, extended lawyer joke, made at the expense of Ramon Martinez. A decadent urban professional about to enjoy another pork sandwich, Ramon becomes a dyspeptic, housebound mute after the sudden pain he feels at his favorite cantina turns out to be a tumor, ""which throbbed in his mouth like a tiny, misplaced heart."" Comensal's brisk, if at times diffusive, storytelling -- in a translation by Charlotte Whittle that conveys both his blunt and sharp humor -- coheres around the question of how a person (as well as his family members, friends and colleagues) deals with the felt and future consequences of sudden dire news.

After Ramon perceives that he has more to worry about than a missed lunch, the novel proceeds through a cycle of doctors' appointments, treatments, counseling sessions, recuperations and reckonings with the inevitable. All this activity is marked most dramatically by a ""total glossectomy,"" the removal of Ramon's entire tongue. The procedure ends his law practice even as it fails to prevent the cancer from spreading. Comensal moves through several responses to Ramon's worsening situation, most of which encourage the proud atheist's fatalistic, interior raging and bleak flights of fancy. After he returns from the hospital to humiliating home-care and insomniac television-watching, he fantasizes about the alpha dad agency he will regain by purchasing Japanese knives advertised on an infomercial: ""He pictured himself sauntering through the house with the roast beef knife, carving things up for his own amusement. He would have butchered at least half of the decorative throw pillows Carmela had piled onto the living room armchairs.""","Jorge Comensal's first novel, ""The Mutations,"" features an attorney rendered mute by tongue cancer who finds comfort in the profane squawks of a parrot.",ca2554f5-4278-5d54-9eb4-243af37be87f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/22/books/review/22Boyagoda1/Boyagoda1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=f98df171105ef2a7538d66a6a1ae8a15e08fa6828300a865e653c01922d1cddd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Jorge Comensal's first novel features a lawyer who can't speak and a parrot who won't stop cursing.,ca2554f5-4278-5d54-9eb4-243af37be87f,N24News/imgs/ca2554f5-4278-5d54-9eb4-243af37be87f.jpg,13
Theater,"Review: Mary-Louise Parker in the Subliminal, Sublime 'Sound Inside'",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/theater/the-sound-inside-review.html,"The urge to move small shows to Broadway should generally be resisted. Whether musicals or plays, most transfers from 199-seat houses feel dinky in palaces accommodating 900, and the frantic efforts made by creative teams to fill the void too often wind up highlighting it instead. There are, of course, exceptions, including ""The Band's Visit,"" which won the Tony Award for best musical last year. That show's director, David Cromer, a minimalist to begin with, didn't inflate the material for Broadway; he battened it down, as if for a storm. Urging the audience to come closer instead of forcing the show to grow bigger, he made you enter its world through the smallest possible door. The surprise -- and joy -- is that the world can seem so vast when approached that way. Or at least it does in Cromer's flawless production of ""The Sound Inside,"" a play by Adam Rapp that opened at Studio 54 on Thursday. When I saw its world premiere at the Williamstown Theater Festival in 2018, it was already a gripping small-scale mystery, and a spectacular showcase for its star, Mary-Louise Parker. Now, having been put through Cromer's less-is-everything makeover, it's even more resonant on Broadway: a tragedy about fiction, both the kind we read and the kind we live.

That's literal here. Bella Lee Baird (Parker) is a 50-ish creative writing professor at Yale who has just received a diagnosis of stage 2 cancer. Addressing the audience directly as if reading a novel-in-progress aloud , she describes -- and in the process aestheticizes -- her unorthodox treatment decisions. These eventually come to involve Christopher Dunn, a freshman in a course of hers called Reading Fiction for Craft. Christopher (Will Hochman) is a misfit at Yale: He won't use email or drink fancy coffee. He may be a misfit everywhere else, too, with his bursts of rudeness, floods of invective and obsessive interest in ""Crime and Punishment."" But he is nevertheless, in Bella's judgment, a prodigy. As he shares with her the pages of his own novel-in-progress, about a Yale freshman named Christopher who does something very bad, the two grow closer. By the time their stories (and fictions) start to merge, the pleasure of fine in-the-moment writing is hopelessly jumbled with dread about what happens next. Even having seen the play before, I was in constant doubt as to its outcome . A piece of advice Bella gives Christopher helps to explain Rapp's technique here: ""If your protagonist is leading you then you'll likely stay ahead of your reader."" Certainly Rapp, a longtime master of foreboding, stays well ahead of us, as Bella and Christopher seem to have stayed ahead of him. Rapp's revisions emphasize those gaps. Lines that tended to explain behavior or to suggest the possibility of such explanations have been cut. (Christopher's father, described as a schizophrenic in the earlier version is now just ""a complete mystery."") Lines that were giveaways as to the characters' emotional states are now refocused. (Bella no longer calls Christopher's prose ""gorgeous"" but ""beautifully restrained."") Lovely, extraneous selections from other writers' works have been trimmed in favor of tantalizing selections from Bella's.

That this never becomes twee is miraculous, but Rapp keeps switching up his approach, sometimes having Bella and Christopher alternate in telling the story and other times having them enact it together in scenes. The specificity of the performances also helps prevent the cultivated tone from cloying. Parker, never better in her 30-year stage career, has dug even deeper into Bella, treating each line as if it were an archaeological site; she builds her performance on artifacts, not theories. And Hochman, who was still pecking his way toward the tricky role at Williamstown, has found it. What can read on the page as a character back-formed from plot necessity, and what therefore seemed like a collection of tics onstage, is now fully connected. Believable both as an 18-year-old and an artist, Hochman -- and this is saying a lot -- is a worthy partner to Parker onstage. But it takes a third character -- Cromer's staging, a living presence in itself -- to make ""The Sound Inside"" so riveting. I don't know what other director would have dared to provide so little visual information in a two-person show; it is even sparer, more subliminal, on Broadway than it was at Williamstown. On the other hand, a lack of visual information is a form of visual information ; once you adjust to it, the dark created by the designers -- Alexander Woodward (sets), Heather Gilbert (lights), Aaron Rhyne (projections) -- becomes exceptionally expressive. Between black and jet black there's room for a lot of drama. Cromer has likewise forsworn, as a writer steers around cliches, any emotional underlining of the kind you typically get from costumes (David Hyman), sound (Daniel Kluger) and overacting. His principle seems to be that of fiction itself: to force an engagement between the author's imagination and the reader 's . When you enter a story, especially one that is basically a mystery, you should do so almost naked, with as little information as possible.

Perhaps it shouldn't surprise us that the result is almost erotic in its withholding. Rapp tips us off to this by having the manuscript of Christopher's novella bear an epigraph from ""Crime and Punishment"": ""We sometimes encounter people, even perfect strangers, who begin to interest us at first sight, somehow suddenly, all at once, before a word is spoken."" ""The Sound Inside"" interests us at first, bleak sight. It keeps our interest not only on its narrowest terms, as a play about writing, but in its larger implications. What we know about other people, what we know about ourselves, are stories that won't stay still. As we write our lives, like a good novel, our lives keep out-writing us.",Adam Rapp's play transfers to Broadway in a rivetingly dark and detailed production by David Cromer.,3e3b7e85-8aff-509c-a80a-cc925480c813,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/17/arts/17sound-inside/17sound-inside-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=b76c29e2b4a8452dc32783eb5ec00d2b45239625f1cfdc6f2659ca334b6756f4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mary-Louise Parker as Bella Lee Baird in Adam Rapp's play ""The Sound Inside.""",3e3b7e85-8aff-509c-a80a-cc925480c813,N24News/imgs/3e3b7e85-8aff-509c-a80a-cc925480c813.jpg,10
Theater,"From 'South Park' to 'Knives Out,' Pop Culture Is Steeped With Sondheim",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/theater/sondheim-in-pop-culture.html,"Last year, it seemed like everyone was doing Sondheim somehow, in ""Marriage Story,"" in ""Knives Out,"" in ""Joker,"" on ""The Morning Show,"" on ""The Politician."" It was quite a little run for Sondheim fans, but those are far from the only instances -- his work is omnipresent television and movies. Sondheim cameos on ""The Simpsons,"" sure, and there's an episode of ""South Park"" that imagines him in a ""bro-down."" Every ""Desperate Housewives"" episode title is a Sondheim lyric, and Andy does ""Sweeney Todd"" on ""The Office."" On ""BoJack Horseman,"" a Stephen King musical opens next to a Sondheim revival, but don't worry: ""'Misery' loves 'Company.'"" He comes up on ""Reno 911!"" and ""Grey's Anatomy,"" on ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" ""30 Rock"" and ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt."" ""The Sopranos."" ""Gilmore Girls."" ""Taxi."" ""Billions."" The Ryan Murphy oeuvre.

Then there are the homages and satires of Sondheim's work. ""My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic"" has a few direct nods, and ""Crazy Ex-Girlfriend"" has some, too. Maybe the best episode of ""Documentary Now!"" is ""Co-Op,"" a masterly spoof of D.A. Pennebaker's essential documentary ""Original Cast Album: Company."" Theater nerdery isn't a requirement to be a writer, but it probably doesn't hurt, and the name ""Sondheim"" itself is shorthand for erudite musical theater in a way that no other writer or show is -- there's a reason Niles and Frasier bicker about whether he's really ""light opera."" The ubiquity of the allusions is particularly interesting in contrast to the relative scarcity of straightforward actual adaptations. (Or Sondheim's own for-the-screen work, like the intriguing but obscure 1966 television one-off ""Evening Primrose."") You could watch ""Sweeney Todd"" or ""Into the Woods,"" fully fleshed out movies that were well regarded at the time of their releases. And in a pinch (or a punch), you could do a lot worse. But you could a lot better, too.

One reason lots of Sondheim adaptations don't work onscreen is the same reason magic tricks and fireworks tend not to, either: the effort is part of the point, the shock of it all, the dazzle. Things are supposed to look good in movies, and Meryl Streep can recount the rooting of her rutabagas as many times as she needs to get it just so. I want a witch who works for it in front of me, without a net, without cuts and do-overs. Movies can't -- or at least typically don't -- convey the unmediated, vivid wretchedness of life, and stage actors and theater audiences have a different pact than screen actors and at-home or cinema audiences. A transcendent feat of strength onstage is just another glassy token onscreen. You need another layer. That's why some of the better on-screen performances aren't direct adaptations but rather characters doing the performance -- it's not Adam Driver as Bobby, it's Adam Driver as Charlie as not really Bobby in ""Marriage Story."" I can't imagine a successful all-teen production of ""Company,"" but Anna Kendrick as the vindictive Fritzi doing ""The Ladies Who Lunch"" in ""Camp"" has its own clash-of-worlds kind of greatness. Maybe a ""Follies"" movie will be good ... or maybe we're best off with Hugh Grant as the villain in ""Paddington 2"" doing a high-glitz prison version of that show's ""Rain on the Roof.""

Richard Linklater is making a movie of ""Merrily We Roll Along"" that will film over 20 years, a la ""Boyhood,"" starring Beanie Feldstein, Blake Jenner and Ben Platt. In the meantime, there is already a near-perfect ""Merrily"" movie, the thorough documentary ""Best Worst Thing That Ever Could Have Happened."" Talk about adding layers back in: ""Merrily"" is about youthful optimism that, pickled in uneven showbiz success, turns into middle-aged bitterness and alienation. The documentary is about youthful optimism met with rude, shocking failure that becomes middle-aged wisdom and acceptance. The show moves in reverse chronology, and in some ways the film does, too, hagiography and canonization in one, the flop that became beloved becomes the movie about the flop. ""Best Worst Thing"" is about everyone involved in ""Merrily,"" but for a more focused biography, there's ""Six By Sondheim,"" an HBO documentary from 2013 that uses six songs -- ""Opening Doors,"" ""Being Alive,"" ""I'm Still Here,"" ""Something's Coming,"" ""Send In the Clowns,"" and ""Sunday in the Park With George"" -- as its tent poles. The new arrangements for some of the songs are fresh and intriguing, and if you can't be charmed by Sondheim himself singing Joe in ""Opening Doors"" and humming ""Some Enchanted Evening,"" I'm not sure why you're even finishing this article.

Sondheim and the host James Lipton geek out briefly about their favorite thesauruses -- ""you work with tools over a period of time, and they become important,"" Sondheim says, cutting through audience giggles -- and lament the paucity of words that rhyme with ""love."" His favorite word is ""pioneer,"" he says, and his least favorite is ""celery."" Not for nothing, Sondheim also says in that interview that if he had to have a different job, he'd pick teacher. His classroom skills are evident in what for my money is the most important Sondheim viewing anyone can do: ""The MTI Conversation Piece With Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine,"" a video for those staging their own productions of ""Into the Woods."" (There's a similar one for ""Assassins,"" but I like the ""Into the Woods"" one better.) Much of it is Sondheim sitting at a white piano, offering background and deconstruction of motifs, as well as tips on acting, directing and conducting.

When it comes time to educate viewers on ""No One Is Alone,"" Sondheim squirms on the bench.

Art & Design,"Wartime Quilts Honor Battles and Leaders, but Mostly Art",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/arts/design/review-wartime-quilts-american-folk-art-museum.html,"An installation view of ""War and Pieced: The Annette Gero Collection of Quilts From Military Fabrics"" at the American Folk Art Museum. At right, a soldier's quilt probably made in India around 1850-1880.

There's plenty of visual heat to be had in New York's galleries and museums this fall, but nowhere more than at the American Folk Art Museum. The radiance shines forth from the bold geometries in ""War and Pieced: The Annette Gero Collection of Quilts From Military Fabrics."" This ravishing exhibition features 29 sturdy, intricate wartime quilts dating from the Napoleonic and Crimean Wars and also the British colonies, made by soldiers, sailors or regimental tailors in Europe or India.

In addition, wartime quilts were sometimes a means of behavior modification. In Britain at least, quilting was encouraged by the military and temperance organizations alike; they gave idle hands something to do between military engagements, staving off the temptations of drink and gambling. They also occupied the time of wounded soldiers recovering in military hospitals and prisoners of war. Some were made for families back home, others to be sold and a few by orderlies as gifts for their commanding officers. With their pulsating squares, diamonds and triangles of color, these works attest to the expansiveness of geometry, as well as its use in flags, banners and coats of arms. The unusual quatrefoil motifs of some individual quilt blocks are based on the four-pronged footprint of battlements known as star forts.

Interspersed among their patterned borders and fields are beaded crowns, embroidered portraits of monarchs, and dedications to siblings. A quilt made by Samuel Sadlowski, a tailor in the Prussian Army taken prisoner during the Napoleonic Wars, is dated 1806; it includes among its many fort blocks, a lovely pastoral frieze in applique illustrating the folk tale of a goose-stealing fox pursued by a hunter. In a quilt from 1766, the central medallion features profile portraits of King George III and Queen Charlotte of Britain, but perhaps most riveting is the thick border distinguished by large applique blocks with propeller-like designs.

The museum says this is the first exhibition in the United States devoted to wartime quilts made of felted wool, as opposed to woven fabrics. It has been organized by Stacy C. Hollander, deputy director and chief curator at the folk art museum, and Annette Gero, an Australian quilt historian and collector. Dr. Gero made one of her first acquisitions at a jumble sale in England about 20 years ago, paying all of 30 pence (50 cents) for a Crimean War quilt. She recounts this in her 2015 book, ""Wartime Quilts: Appliques and Geometric Masterpieces From Military Fabrics,"" which traces a history of war quilts beginning with ""The Great Pazyryk Felt,"" found in southern Siberia, dating from around 300 B.C. and now in the collection of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg.

Dr. Gero also notes the crucial importance of felt to the genre. It doesn't fray, making it easier to handle; is thick enough to hide stitches and allows shapes to be fit together like puzzle pieces with no seam allowance (a technique known as intarsia). In addition felt could be cut and sandwiched together for flowerlike decorations and crenelated edges. While the show is a tribute to Dr. Gero's leading scholarship, only slightly more than half of the quilts are from her collection; the remainder come from collections in London, Vienna and New York, and also the International Quilt Study Center and Museum at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, which is a collaborator with the American Folk Art Museum.

The play between the patterns and the representations they frame is part of the energy of many works. Perhaps the most subtle integration of the two occurs in an army quilt commemorating the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, whose opening battle, at Isandlwana in South Africa, the label tells us ""stunned the world"" when the Zulu, armed only with spears and knives, decimated a battalion of British foot soldiers equipped with rifles and artillery.

The quilt's pattern is especially explosive, because it is made only of diamond shapes that decrease in size toward the center; its volatility is further enhanced by four bladelike shapes pointing inward, each rather discreetly embroidered with a grass hut, a drum, a shield with spears and a butterfly. Embroidery reaches a height of both skill and mixed messages in a Regimental Bed Rug that includes the name of the soldier who made it, Sergeant Malcolm MacLeod, a large sailing ship and flags. These are flanked by two lavishly embroidered vases of flowers and a bear-fur helmet like those worn by Buckingham Palace guards. But many of the quilts avoid references to war or any images at all, gathering power from an impressive, admittedly heraldic, range of geometric patterns and their optical effects. In some, the different patterns and shifting rhythms continue to the center, sometimes culminating in a compass rose. One example is covered entirely with concentric squares of pinwheel stars. Others dispense with the centers altogether, like one consisting of a dozen concentric squares all different from one another. This suggests that the felt quilting technique accommodated many different skill sets; makers with limited chops made more abstract, evenly patterned quilts that look especially modern today. Wartime quilts confirm once more that abstraction is hardly the province of modernist painters. They join the expanding category of 18th and 19th-century geometric abstraction of the West, whose achievements include Amish quilts, Navajo blankets and the parfleche rawhide containers of the Plains Indians, made of elegantly thin leather and usually painted by women. Like all of these, the wartime quilts are resounding tributes to human ingenuity and the power of art.","Military quilts made by men during the 18th and 19th century are, pure and simple, eye dazzlers.",f8231638-d9fb-577f-860b-66d5c09e6dca,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/27/arts/27warquilts6/27warquilts6-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=0fd96c7f12457bf2dff13f1ae96be4a90d83d3a97120c7eebde734837b18fae0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Beaded Soldier's Quilt, artist unidentified, India, circa 1860–1870.

Science,Mount Wilson Observatory Survives a Trial by Fire,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/19/science/wilson-observatory-bobcat-wildfires.html,"Mount Wilson Observatory, where astronomers a century ago first described the expansion of the universe, appears to have survived a close call with the Bobcat fire, which has been ravaging the San Gabriel Mountains in Southern California. ""It looks very good,"" Dan Kohne, a trustee of the Mount Wilson Institute, which runs the observatory, said in an email Friday morning. ""The Observatory has been declared safe."" The observatory sits on a knife-edge ridge overlooking Pasadena. For the past week, after being evacuated from the observatory, astronomers have watched in horror as webcams posted on the mountain relayed images of flames racing up the steep ravines to within a few hundred feet of the familiar telescope domes, in which modern cosmology was born. The scientists were reduced to commenting on Twitter about huge water drops, speculating about which of the fires in view were backfires, and offering praise for the firefighters.

""Much of the immediately surrounding terrain is too steep to negotiate to create breaks,"" Mr. Kohne wrote in an email a couple of days earlier, when things looked bad. ""But the fire crews cleared more defensible space everywhere they could. I take what hope I can knowing the essential structures are concrete and steel -- and in the case of the domes, double skinned -- and all the reservoir tanks are filled with over three-quarters of a million gallons of water."" On Tuesday, firefighters had managed to beat back fires that had crept up the east side of the mountain, only for flames -- visible from downtown Pasadena -- to reappear two days later on the southwestern side of the mountain.

But by 10 a.m Friday, a composite image, generated at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, at the foot of Mount Wilson, of the observatory and the fire boundaries suggested that the observatory buildings had been saved; the edge of the burned area only just brushed the edge of the ridgeline. There was blue sky above the mountain. ""It's not over yet,"" Rebecca Oppenheimer, astronomy curator at the American Museum of Natural History, said in a note to the astronomy community on Thursday morning. ""Fingers crossed, but the smoke damage has to be horrific already, even if this fire business goes away."" The many days of smoke and heat had most likely wreaked havoc on the telescopes' optics, she said. Mr. Kohne said that it would be some time before anyone could visit in person but that there had been no reports of damage. Mount Wilson Observatory was founded in 1904 by George Ellery Hale, a solar astronomer who had been director at the Yerkes Observatory at the University of Chicago and was an indefatigable astronomical entrepreneur. Funding was provided by the Carnegie Institution for Science.

Despite the proximity to the lights of Los Angeles, Mount Wilson, located essentially on the edge of the continent, was blessed with steady air, which allowed for very crisp images of the stars. In 1908, Hale installed a new a 60-inch-diameter primary telescope, then the largest in the world, on the mountain. He followed that in 1917 with the 100-inch Hooker telescope, which remained the world's biggest telescope until 1949, when a 200-inch telescope -- also a Hale project -- was installed on Palomar Mountain further south.

It was with that telescope that Edwin Hubble and other astronomers, including Harlow Shapley, Walter Baade and Milton Humason -- who had started his career as a mule skinner hauling supplies up the mountain -- first gauged the size of the Milky Way, the nature of its stars and the distances to other galaxies and deduced that other galaxies were all flying away from us: The universe was expanding. Also at Mount Wilson, Fritz Zwicky had the intuition that something he called dark matter was filling the universe. With those achievements and ideas, Mount Wilson became a center of the scientific universe, a name respected in the dusty byways of the world. Albert Einstein visited several times. In addition to the 60-inch and 100-inch telescopes, Mount Wilson has had three solar telescopes with which continuous studies of sunspots have been carried out for a century. Other instruments there include the new Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy, built and operated by Georgia State University. It consists of six one-meter telescopes that operate collectively as an interferometer to conduct high-resolution studies of stars. In 1989, as part of an effort to free up resources to build telescopes in Chile, the Carnegie Institution handed over operation of the observatory to the nonprofit Mount Wilson Institute. Subsequently, the 100-inch and 60-inch telescopes were retired from research and are now devoted to public observing. Mount Wilson itself has become a tourist attraction, a place where in normal times the public can visit, eat at the Cosmic Cafe, see the stars and commune with the ghosts of Hubble, Einstein and other great minds of the cosmos for at least a little while longer.","The birthplace of modern cosmology ""has been declared safe"" from the wildfires that have ravaged the surrounding area in Southern California.",327fdd69-d5d6-56af-b8da-25e2aa98e725,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/18/science/18SCI-OUTTHERE-MTWILSON/18SCI-OUTTHERE-MTWILSON-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=ed786344a1f60a823e71e542eb3ab6bbd9d198fb6099f81b4953db044c47f04e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Firefighters atop Mount Wilson in Los Angeles on Wednesday.,327fdd69-d5d6-56af-b8da-25e2aa98e725,N24News/imgs/327fdd69-d5d6-56af-b8da-25e2aa98e725.jpg,2
Sports,W.N.B.A. Players Escalate Protest of Anti-B.L.M. Team Owner,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/sports/basketball/wnba-dream-loeffler-warnock.html,"Players for the Atlanta Dream and other teams across the W.N.B.A. have begun a public show of defiance by wearing T-shirts endorsing the Democratic opponent of the Dream's co-owner Senator Kelly Loeffler, Republican of Georgia, who is in a tightly contested race for her seat and has spoken disparagingly of the Black Lives Matter movement. Images of players, including the nine-time All-Star Diana Taurasi, wearing the shirts endorsing Dr. Raphael G. Warnock flooded social media on Tuesday ahead of a nationally televised matchup between Atlanta and the Phoenix Mercury. Across the chest of the black T-shirts were two words ""Vote Warnock,"" a reference to the Atlanta pastor who is one of the top Democrats running against Loeffler in a special election in November.

It was the latest escalation in a conflict that has roiled the W.N.B.A. in recent weeks. Loeffler, who owns 49 percent of the team, has publicly and frequently derided the league for dedicating its season to the Black Lives Matter movement, provoking sharp criticism from some of the league's most high-profile figures. The players' union has called for her ouster, but W.N.B.A. Commissioner Cathy Engelbert told CNN in mid-July that Loeffler would not be forced to sell the team.

Elizabeth Williams, who has played for the Dream since 2016, said in an interview on Monday that the players plan to ""vocally support"" Warnock in the coming weeks, and that players have had ""several"" conversations with him. ""When we realized what our owner was doing and how she was kind of using us and the Black Lives Matter movement for her political gain, we felt like we didn't want to feel kind of lost as the pawns in this,"" Williams said.

Warnock, in an email, said he was ""honored and humbled by the overwhelming support from the W.N.B.A. players."" ""This movement gives us the opportunity to fight for what we believe in, and I stand by all athletes promoting social justice on and off the court,"" Warnock said. ""Senator Loeffler and those like her who seek to silence and dismiss others when they speak up for justice have planted themselves on the wrong side of history."" Williams said the idea to publicly endorse Warnock came from Sue Bird, the 11-time All-Star guard for the Seattle Storm. Both Williams and Bird are executives in the players' union. Top players also consulted with Stacey Abrams, the Democrat who lost a close race for the Georgia governor's seat in 2018 to Brian Kemp, a Republican. Abrams joined the players' union board of advocates last summer. In planning the demonstration, the players thought it was important that the T-shirts debuted during a game that was nationally televised. Tuesday's game between the Dream and Mercury was scheduled to be broadcast on ESPN 2. Williams said that the Dream players will continue to wear the T-shirts in upcoming games, and other teams have agreed to do so, too. ""We can't really do anything about her ownership,"" Williams said, referring to Loeffler. ""That's not something we can control. We can control who we vote for."" The teams' coaches were made aware of the demonstration, Williams said, but she was unsure whether Mary Brock, the philanthropist who owns the other 51 percent of the Dream, was told ahead of time. Brock thus far has not publicly addressed the conflict between Loeffler and the W.N.B.A. players. This level of public protest -- players on a team openly campaigning against their own owner -- is virtually unheard of in professional sports. But it is not out of character for players in the W.N.B.A., a league that has frequently shown a willingness to tackle social justice issues publicly. In 2016, W.N.B.A. players were among the first professional athletes in the United States to demonstrate against police brutality, also with T-shirts. The W.N.B.A. initially fined those players before rescinding the fines.

Recently, the league has waded deeper into politics, in large part because of its players' willingness to do the same. In 2018, the W.N.B.A. partnered with Planned Parenthood for an initiative called ""Take a Seat, Take a Stand,"" which sent a portion of ticket proceeds to multiple groups including Planned Parenthood. Since then, W.N.B.A. players have often been spotted at the front lines of demonstrations, especially recently after the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, who were killed by the police. The initial response to Loeffler, who is not involved in the day-to-day operations of the team, came after she wrote a letter in early July to Engelbert, saying, ""I adamantly oppose the Black Lives Matter political movement, which has advocated for the defunding of police."" Loeffler also accused the movement of promoting ""violence and destruction across the country."" One of the most high-profile rebukes came from Dream players, who issued a collective statement on July 10: ""It is not extreme to demand change after centuries of inequality. This is not a political statement. This is a statement of humanity."" Loeffler has since made a cause celebre of criticizing the W.N.B.A.'s commitment to social justice, frequently conducting interviews painting herself as a victim of so-called ""cancel culture"" as a result of the backlash from players. In her Senate race, Loeffler is fighting to remain in the seat she was appointed to late last year after Johnny Isakson stepped down because of health problems. To win, a candidate must get 50 percent of the vote. If no candidate reaches that mark, the top two candidates will have a runoff, which is widely expected to be the outcome. The other top candidate in the race is Representative Doug Collins, a Republican and ardent supporter of President Trump.","Led by the members of the Atlanta Dream, players have begun wearing T-shirts supporting a political opponent of Senator Kelly Loeffler, who co-owns the Dream and has spoken against the Black Lives Matter movement.",eca5cca5-1f28-5d87-9cc1-faa40510a2ab,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/05/sports/05WNBA-PRINT/05WNBA-PRINT-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c9e63181e6ab6da5798a95b094fb7b0aeeb260ed294195a22453b472cc7da87a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Before their game on Tuesday, Atlanta Dream players wore shirts backing Dr. Raphael G.

Science,Updated Brain Map Identifies Nearly 100 New Regions,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/science/human-connectome-brain-map.html,"The brain looks like a featureless expanse of folds and bulges, but it's actually carved up into invisible territories. Each is specialized: Some groups of neurons become active when we recognize faces, others when we read, others when we raise our hands. On Wednesday, in what many experts are calling a milestone in neuroscience, researchers published a spectacular new map of the brain, detailing nearly 100 previously unknown regions -- an unprecedented glimpse into the machinery of the human mind. Scientists will rely on this guide as they attempt to understand virtually every aspect of the brain, from how it develops in children and ages over decades, to how it can be corrupted by diseases like Alzheimer's and schizophrenia. ""It's a step towards understanding why we're we,"" said David Kleinfeld, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved in the research.

Scientists created the map with advanced scanners and computers running artificial intelligence programs that ""learned"" to identify the brain's hidden regions from vast amounts of data collected from hundreds of test subjects, a far more sophisticated and broader effort than had been previously attempted. While an important advance, the new atlas is hardly the final word on the brain's workings. It may take decades for scientists to figure out what each region is doing, and more will be discovered in coming decades. ""This map you should think of as version 1.0,"" said Matthew F. Glasser, a neuroscientist at Washington University School of Medicine and lead author of the new research. ""There may be a version 2.0 as the data get better and more eyes look at the data. We hope the map can evolve as the science progresses."" The first hints of the brain's hidden geography emerged more than 150 years ago. In the 1860s, the physician Pierre Paul Broca was intrigued by two of his patients who were unable to speak. After they died, Broca examined their brains. On the outer layer, called the cortex, he found that both had suffered damage to the same patch of tissue.

In the late 1800s, a group of German researchers identified other regions of the cortex, each having distinct types of cells packed together in unique ways. In 1907, Korbinian Brodmann published a catalog of 52 brain regions. Neuroscientists have relied on his hand-drawn map ever since, adding a modest number of new regions with their own research. ""This is the standard for where you are in the brain,"" said Dr. Glasser. Three years ago, Dr. Glasser and his colleagues set out to create a new standard. They drew on data collected by the Human Connectome Project, in which 1,200 volunteers were studied with powerful new scanners. The project team recorded high-resolution images of each participant's brain, and then recorded its activity during hours of tests on memory, language and other kinds of thought. In previous attempts to map the cortex, scientists typically had looked only at one kind of evidence at a time -- say, the arrangements of cells. The Human Connectome Project has made it possible to study the brain in much greater detail.

In addition to looking at the activity of the brain, the scientists also looked at its anatomy. They measured the amount of myelin, for example, a fatty substance that insulated neurons. They found sharp contrasts in myelin levels from one region of the cortex to the next. ""We have 112 different types of information we can tap into,"" said David C. Van Essen, a principal investigator with the Human Connectome Project at Washington University Medical School. Using these variables, the scientists trained a computer with data from 210 brains to recognize discrete regions of the cortex. Once the computer profiled the distinctive combinations of myelin, activity and other characteristics, they tested it on 210 other brains. The computer pinpointed the regions in the new brains 96.6 percent of the time. The scientists found that only a small number of features were required to map the brain. That means that researchers will be able to use their method to map an individual's brain in a little over an hour of scanning. The map produced by the computer includes 83 familiar regions, such as Broca's area, but includes 97 that were unknown -- or just forgotten. In the 1950s, for example, German researchers noticed a patch on the side of the brain in which neurons had little myelin, compared with neighboring regions. But the finding was soon neglected.

In other parts of the cortex, the scientists were able to partition previously identified regions into smaller ones. For example, they discovered that a large region near the front of the brain, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, actually is made up of a dozen smaller zones. The region becomes active during many different kinds of thought, ranging from decision-making to deception. It's possible that each of the newly identified smaller parts is important for one of those tasks. The computer program developed by the scientists became so adept at mapping the cortex that it could identify hidden regions even when they took on unusual shapes. Twelve of the research subjects, for example, have a 55b region that's split into two isolated patches. (The researchers don't know whether this affects how the subjects use language.) Other neuroscientists hope that the new map will sharpen their experiments, allowing them to discover how the brain's cogs mesh. ""The next big step is seeing what this can do for us in terms of buying more power,"" said Emily S. Finn, a graduate student at Yale University who has used Human Connectome Project data to find links between brain activity and intelligence. Dr. Kleinfeld predicted that other researchers will find ways to verify the new map's accuracy. Genetic testing, for example: If 180 regions of the cortex really are distinct, then the neurons in each should share a distinct combination of active genes.","Data from 1,200 brain scans performed as part of the Human Connectome Project allowed researchers to unveil the brain's hidden geography.",4b7c302e-08fd-5d31-b6cc-99b21705aabf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/21/science/21ZIMMER1/21ZIMMER1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=dafd44dd32259cc32ebe7a1ff6b0faedd5f8522db57ed0620c3e1214ee065027&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A new map based on brain scan data collected by the Human Connectome Project.

Theater,Review: 'Dana H.' Maps a Harrowing Journey Into Hell,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/theater/review-dana-h-hnath.html,"First impressions might suggest otherwise. But Lucas Hnath's ""Dana H.,"" a one-woman drama that explodes expectations at every turn, is one of the richest, most complete works of theater to come along in many seasons. And by its end, you realize that its singular power could be achieved only in real time, on a stage, with a live audience as its witness. Watching the early moments of this production, which opened on Tuesday night at the Vineyard Theater, you may wonder, a bit impatiently, why its account of a violent kidnapping is being told in the way it is. ""Dana H"" is not a conventionally scripted or acted drama. It is, or at first appears to be, a rather basic documentary work, which consists almost entirely of a recorded interview with the title character. (In some ways, it is a perfect companion piece to the uncanny documentary play ""Is This A Room,"" recently staged at the Vineyard.) The subject is Dana Higginbotham, a Florida hospice chaplain -- and the playwright's mother -- who was held hostage for five months by a psychotic client, and who is indeed telling her own story. But while it is Higginbotham's voice we hear, she is not the woman who appears onstage. We see instead the wonderful actress Deirdre O'Connell, who mouths, with near-perfect specificity, what is said on the recording. It is, in other words, a deliberately limited performance, stripped of a whole layer of interpretation that O'Connell might bring to the part if she were allowed to speak it herself.

Yet that implicit distance between performer and character winds up bringing us closer to both. As directed with virtuosic pace and shading by Les Waters, this first-person account of a season in hell becomes an ever-deepening exercise in concentrated listening -- and a journey into an empathy so intimate that it melts the boundaries of your own sense of a solid self. At the center of ""Dana H.,"" a coproduction of Vineyard, Center Theater Group and the Goodman Theater, is a tale about an unspeakable violation of autonomous self, one so upsetting it perhaps can be approached only by the staggered degrees that give this work its form. Higginbotham says in the recording that this is the first time she has ever talked this explicitly about what happened to her during those five months in 1998. ""I can't be who I am with people,"" she says. ""I can't tell people about this."" She had certainly never spoken about it in such terms to her son, Hnath, a dramatist of quicksilver intellect and probing compassion who was a college student in New York at the time of his mother's abduction. Hnath, whose earlier works include ""A Doll's House, Part 2"" and ""Hillary and Clinton,"" did not conduct the interviews that make up ""Dana H."" The other voice we hear in the recording belongs to Hnath's friend, the writer and director Steve Cosson, who conducted the sessions nearly two decades after the events took place. Those sessions occurred over several days and have been pieced together into a production that is said to last 75 minutes, though what you experience eludes any usual measurement of time. No one here is pretending that what occurs onstage is a facsimile of the interviews. The tapes include the distortions of a do-it-yourself recording project, with its prickly static and wandering amplification. (Mikhail Fiksel did the crucial sound design.) We periodically hear metallic beeps, to indicate editing and elisions.

Supertitles are projected, dividing the show into self-contained segments (""A Patient Named Jim,"" ""The Next Five Months,"" ""The Bridge""). Well, sort of, since what is being discussed here renders all dividing lines arbitrary and inadequate. And of course from the beginning, we know that O'Connell is not Higginbotham. We watch the actress being fitted with the earpieces that will pour her character's voice into her head, allowing her to concentrate fully on the arduous task of precisely lip-syncing every word she hears. We are thus deliberately made aware of the conscious exertion required for this process. But there's a point, maybe five or ten minutes into the show, in which O'Connell's effort to become another person melt into Higginbotham's struggle to describe a chapter in her life that still feels, in many ways, beyond imagining. (She occasionally consults a well-worn manuscript she has written, like a talisman that might bring order to chaos.) As Higginbotham's voice stumbles, stutters and trails into silence -- while O'Connell's face subtly registers the ache and exasperation of words failing their speaker -- a part of us can't help leaning in, silently and forcefully willing her to continue. What follows may be deeply upsetting to hear, but there's a sense that it has to be given voice. It says much about this show's power that I have had to rise from my desk and pace before even trying to summarize the events at the heart of ""Dana H."" The play's catalyst is Jim, a former convict and member of the Aryan Brotherhood, whom Higginbotham mentored at a psychiatric ward after he tried to kill himself. He became increasingly reliant on her. And one night, when she wouldn't open the door of her Florida house to him, he broke in through the bathroom window. He hit her with the home alarm system he had ripped off the wall, knocking her unconscious. ""That was the beginning of the end,"" Higginbotham says. ""That was the beginning of the next five months.""","Lucas Hnath's brilliant, boundary-melting play, starring a marvelous Deirdre O'Connell, is a first-person account of the violent kidnapping of his mother.",ec7dd4c0-1a17-5720-9332-571218ca4afa,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/26/arts/25danah1/25danah1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=d5354485926625b9382d6bdbbc17e253b004963be2f1d5e7ba7effe8baefcbb3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Deirdre O'Connell in ""Dana H.""

Dance,"Another Taylor Marathon: They Push Dancers, Don't They?",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/17/arts/dance/another-taylor-marathon-they-push-dancers-dont-they.html,"The choreographer Paul Taylor will be 84 in July; his company's current season at the David H. Koch Theater is its 60th anniversary. His three-page program biography, laden with superlatives, begins with the sentence ""Choreographer Paul Taylor is the greatest living pioneer of America's indigenous art of modern dance."" Though he's certainly a master, it's been decades since he seemed any kind of pioneer. He has never failed to create two new works each year, but in his recent creations, he has kept returning to the topics of exhaustion, death and self-destructive doggedness. It's hard not to feel that these themes reflect -- sometimes wittily, sometimes poetically -- the tension, weariness, resignation and perseverance of a long career. How to keep grinding this stuff out? In ""De Suenos (Of Dreams)"" and ""De Suenos Que Se Repiten (Of Recurring Dreams)"" (both 2007), he dramatized dark dreamscapes arising out of the Mexican Day of the Dead. In ""Beloved Renegade"" (2008) -- his masterpiece of this period -- an artist revisits his life before paying farewell to it: His muse becomes the messenger of his death. ""Also Playing"" (2009) depicts absurd old vaudeville sketches churned out for their umpteenth performances. (The Dying Swan dies three different deaths in quick succession.) ""To Make Crops Grow"" (2012) shows how, by lottery, a village girl becomes the sacrificial victim who must dance till she drops, whereupon the other villagers stone her to death. And the subject of his latest piece, ""Marathon Cadenzas,"" which received its world premiere on Friday night, is dance as an endurance test. It dramatizes the dance marathons of the 1920s and '30s, when (as in the 1969 movie ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"") the last people still performing win the prize money. Mr. Taylor sets it to a series of busily wacky items by Raymond Scott. It's a sour piece; the dance referee here is sleazy and corrupt.

It's also a minor one, despite the commendable historical details characteristic of Mr. Taylor's many genre studies and despite a few remarkable but brief moments. In those sequences, notably a solo for Michael Trusnovec, you feel that Mr. Taylor's interest has been fleetingly ignited; otherwise, ""Marathon Cadenzas"" feels like a solid piece of slick, uninspired, not-quite-believable period-piece study. By ""genre studies,"" I mean those history pieces in which Mr. Taylor reimagines particular aspects of an era -- the Middle Ages (in ""Dust""), the late-Romantic era in France (""Offenbach Overtures""), the Depression (""Black Tuesday"" as well as ""Marathon Cadenzas""), World War II (""Company B""), the '60s (""A Field of Grass"" and ""Changes"") and more. The way he does his research and evokes a bygone age is one of the less remarked-upon aspects of Mr. Taylor's skill. It's part of his thorough professionalism and determination to keep changing the subject. ""Marathon Cadenzas,"" showing his dancers' vivid skills as actors, does not look like any previous Taylor creation. And yet it leaves two tastes in the mouth that have recurred with his works. One is a whiff of condescension: He wraps up his treatment in a shrewd satirical nutshell (""Weren't things ghastly then?""), squeezes out a few drops of intermittent compassion for some of his characters, but shows little tenderness for the topic. The other -- it has become a pervasive Taylor theme -- is his unshakable obsession with dance as endurance: what Beckett epitomized in the line ""I can't go on, I'll go on."" On Friday, ""Marathon Cadenzas"" was the centerpiece of a program whose two other works were receiving their first performances this season, ""A Field of Grass"" (1993), set to songs by Harry Nilsson, and ""Arden Court"" (1981), set to excerpts from Boyce symphonies. The ""grass"" in the title of the first piece is an obvious pun. The protagonist, Robert Kleinendorst, is smoking marijuana as the curtain rises, with a cloud of smoke above his head. In the next number, six cartoon hippies enter, in flared jeans. (The way they prance on is another dash of Taylor condescension.) There's plenty to admire in Mr. Taylor's ""Field of Grass"" dance making -- the cross-stitch of footwork in ""I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City,"" the changing patterns in ""Daybreak"" -- and the way he keeps providing different facets of the '60s (and early '70s) tone. But ""Field of Grass"" is not a piece that projects well in the deep auditorium of the Koch Theater, although something that reads all too well is the muscular tension of Mr. Kleinendorst's upper body: His shoulders keep stiffening.

""Arden Court,"" a full-out dance piece for nine performers, ends with its most breathtaking phrase: As one man (James Samson, the company's tallest and most broad-shouldered) follows a high-energy line of other dancers, he jumps high, then, without changing gears or losing impetus, rolls rapidly on the floor in the same direction. The transition -- thrilling and also alarming -- is so quick that you can't see how it's done. ""Arden Court"" abounds in such contrasts -- high against low, fast against slow, immobility against nonstop motion, lightness against weight -- and it comes from an era when Mr. Taylor was exploring dance itself as though testing its capacities. At several points, his experiments make the audience laugh out loud, but the piece's exhilaration and momentum are larger than its comedy. The season is still young, but already, every Taylor dancer has made an impression. The program lists them in order of seniority, but four of the company's junior six -- Aileen Roehl, Michael Novak, Heather McGinley and George Smallwood -- are already among its most striking and talked about. Ms. Roehl's platinum blond hair and Ms. McGinley's red locks shine like torches. Their dancing and versatility of characterization are no less vivid.","""Marathon Cadenzas,"" the centerpiece of a program by the Paul Taylor Dance Company on Friday at the David H.

Real Estate,Surprise! No Rent Increases!,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/25/realestate/surprise-no-rent-increases.html,"Residents at 8 Spruce Street were told this summer that they could renew their leases without paying more in rent.

A friend recently told me, breathless with excitement, that she was renewing her lease at 8 Spruce Street, the Frank Gehry-designed 76-story skyscraper, without any rent increase. In this red-hot rental market, why would the landlord, Forest City Ratner Companies, renew its leases without demanding more in rent? Most of us who rent, and that is the bulk of New Yorkers, expect to be mildly abused by their landlords. Every year as our leases near the end of their terms, we wait anxiously to find out what next year's outlay will look like. And when we gaze at behemoth rental towers that offer perks like full-time doormen, health clubs and live-in supers, those annual rent increases seem as inevitable as a roof-deck misting station. But that may just not be true.

Lynda Lippin, 47, lives in an alcove studio at 8 Spruce, officially known as New York by Gehry at 8 Spruce Street, with her husband and dog, a onetime stray. After two years, she still carries around the silver Tiffany key ring she was given when she moved in, a square in the shape of the tower. She speaks fondly of the private residents-only viewing party held not long ago for a $35,000-a-month penthouse, where cheese and wine were circulated amid the unobstructed 360-degree views. She attends the buildingwide barbecues, where gourmet ice-cream sandwiches are handed out. And even though she doesn't regularly go to the building's gym, ""it is lovely to stare at the snow falling on the glass ceiling"" while swimming in its heated pool. Last month the managing agent e-mailed her to say that if she committed to her two-year lease by mid-July, rather than wait until it expired at the end of October, she could renew at her current rent, around $3,300 a month. Her annual $300 per-person amenities fee would also be waived. ""I couldn't believe it,"" said Ms. Lippin, a master instructor at Real Pilates, a studio in TriBeCa. ""I was stunned, actually."" She signed the lease immediately. This is a far cry from the rent increases and stiff competition that most New York renters are experiencing. ""It's a tough market,"" said Marc Lewis, the chairman and a senior adviser for Coldwell Banker A.C. Lawrence, whose listings generally skew toward the lower end of the price spectrum. ""At most buildings, rents go up every year, and the increases have been more this year than last year and the year before that. ""Landlords rarely give tenants a hometown discount anymore,"" he added, referring to concessions offered to current tenants. ""Now, if you were paying $2,000 last year, this year they are asking $2,700.""

There are many reasons why Forest City Ratner might forgo rent increases. The luxury market, which has been commanding steadily higher prices for more than a year, may finally have plateaued. This may be especially true downtown, where luxury rents have fallen over the past year. There are also the costs associated with having to find new tenants, as well as competition from new developments in the neighborhood. Rental renewal rates are proprietary to landlords and nearly impossible to track. Declining to discuss specifics, Melissa Roman Burch, the director of commercial and residential development for Forest City Ratner, said in a statement, ""Since the building opened we have received great feedback from tenants, who are drawn to Frank Gehry's iconic design as well as the building's world-class amenities, and our renewals reflect this enthusiasm."" Cliff Finn, an executive vice president of Douglas Elliman Development Marketing, who, while at Citi Habitats, oversaw the original leasing at 8 Spruce Street, said there were ""lots of reasons for landlords offering promotions like this."" With 899 apartments, the building was so large that incentives like free rent were necessary when it opened, to fill it up as quickly as possible, said Mr. Finn, who continues to represent the building. ""So now, when these tenants come up for renewal, having a zero percent increase helps them mentally adjust to the full market rent."" In other words, while the landlord may seem to be giving something away, Forest City Ratner maintains that it is actually receiving more rent from Ms. Lippin and her husband. Since they were given two months rent-free when they first signed their lease, their net effective rent has been about 8 percent lower than the face value of the unit. But from Ms. Lippin's perspective, the lack of free rent in the new lease makes little difference. ""Except for those first two months two years ago,"" she said, ""we've been paying full rent, so the money out of our pocket stays the same as it has always been."" The overall rental market may also be a factor in Forest City Ratner's decision. After quarter upon quarter of steep price increases, it looks as though it may finally be flattening out. ""In Manhattan over the last 18 months, there has been an unprecedented rise in rents,"" said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. ""But in the last five months, it has been sliding, with rents rising at a slower pace."" According to a recent rental report for Douglas Elliman that Mr. Miller wrote, the median rents downtown increased a nominal 1.5 percent, to $3,350, in July compared with July 2012. And in the market for three-bedroom apartments, which are typically luxury units, the median rent downtown actually fell 8.7 percent, to $5,250, during the same period.

The Gehry building in particular seems to have seen some softening of prices. When it was under construction, it marketed its penthouses for as much as $60,000 a month, a staggering price for the area. It eventually lowered the price tag to $45,000 and is now renting them for $35,000. ""Sometimes it behooves a landlord to keep a tenant in place even if there is a minor dip below the market-rate rent,"" said Gary L. Malin, the president of Citi Habitats. ""The reality is, if there are a significant amount of people whose leases are overturning at the same time, or if you consider the cost of preparing an apartment for a new tenant, like painting, concessions and paying the brokerage fee, it may make sense."" Eight Spruce Street is also about to have some competition. Next summer, a few blocks to the south, the former headquarters of the financial giant A.I.G. will open as a huge luxury rental development. The developer Rose Associates is converting the building, known as 70 Pine, into 780 units that will have a hotel component and amenities that include two bowling alleys and an observatory and cigar bar with unimpeded views of downtown. Given these factors, Forest City Ratner's decision to offer no rent increases ""makes sense,"" Mr. Miller said. ""The landlord is anticipating that the rents are already high, let's keep the building at the current rents and keep it full."" But while downtown and 8 Spruce Street may be finding their footing, the overall luxury market is faring somewhat better. The top 10 percent of rental units across Manhattan saw a median price increase of 11.7 percent, to $8,412, in July compared with July 2012, according to data from Mr. Miller. And comparable buildings, like MiMA, a 500-unit rental at 450 West 42nd Street that opened last year, are not offering a break on renewals. ""We just went through our first wave of renewals and we didn't offer any concessions,"" said Daria Salusbury, a senior vice president who heads the luxury rental division for Related, ""and 90 to 95 percent came with a modest rent increase. The rental market isn't the strongest I have seen, but I've seen worse."" So the market slide that 8 Spruce Street may be experiencing might be a function of its location. The neighborhood was hit hard by Hurricane Sandy, causing some tenants to leave. The building had backup generators, but there was still cold water and intermittent power for 9 days; the landlord offered tenants a prorated rent reduction to compensate for the inconvenience. At the time 8 Spruce came on the market in 2011, it was said to be breaking a price ceiling in the financial district. Maybe the landlord, having broken into these higher price ranges, has decided that at least for the time being, it can go no higher. And that suits Ms. Lippin just fine.",A decision to hold the line at 8 Spruce Street is not exactly being copied elsewhere.,5f21b22d-6cd3-592b-ab4d-79299d42b80b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/25/realestate/25DEAL_SPAN/25-Deal-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=45410b15c0e5188ff0e05d62aceaac1796e2350480f7bd8fd74d84f4e6f472e3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Residents at 8 Spruce Street were told this summer that they could renew their leases without paying more in rent.,5f21b22d-6cd3-592b-ab4d-79299d42b80b,N24News/imgs/5f21b22d-6cd3-592b-ab4d-79299d42b80b.jpg,7
Music,Trump Lashes Out at Sweden Over ASAP Rocky's Detention,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/arts/music/asap-rocky-charged-sweden.html,"In an unusual flexing of diplomatic muscle, President Trump lashed out on Thursday at the prime minister of Sweden over what he said was the unfair treatment of the rapper ASAP Rocky, who was charged with assault earlier in the day after nearly three weeks in Swedish custody. ""Give A$AP Rocky his FREEDOM,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, further inflaming the international incident that has grown out of the musician's arrest early this month. ""We do so much for Sweden but it doesn't seem to work the other way around. Sweden should focus on its real crime problem!""

Rocky was charged on Thursday with having committed an assault causing actual bodily harm on June 30 in central Stockholm, Swedish prosecutors said in a statement, capping weeks of speculation about how the country would handle a street brawl that was captured, at least in part, on camera. The rapper will remain in custody, at least until his trial begins on Tuesday, the Swedish Prosecution Authority said in a statement. The punishment for Rocky could include a fine based on his daily earnings or a maximum of two years in prison, said Annika Collin, a spokeswoman for the Swedish Prosecution Authority. The decision to charge Rocky, and Mr. Trump's increasing ire over the charges, will sharpen the focus on a case that started as a fistfight, but has ballooned into much more, with Sweden facing accusations of racism and human rights abuses for its treatment of the rapper. Rocky, 30, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, is accused of assaulting Mustafa Jafari in Stockholm after an altercation in the street that was captured on video. The rapper and two other men were detained on July 5 as prosecutors investigated the matter.

Slobodan Jovicic, Rocky's lawyer, said in a telephone interview on Thursday that the rapper acted in self-defense. On July 2, Rocky posted two videos on Instagram that Mr. Jovicic said show Mr. Jafari and another man following and harassing the rapper, despite being repeatedly asked to stop. In one of his tweets on Thursday, President Trump referred to the videos, ""watched the tapes of A$AP Rocky, and he was being followed and harassed by troublemakers."" He also used the hashtag #FreeRocky.

But Daniel Suneson, the public prosecutor for Stockholm, said Mr. Jafari had been punched, kicked and struck with a glass bottle in an attack that lasted several minutes. One widely watched video shows Rocky throwing Mr. Jafari to the ground and, along with two members of his entourage who also will face trial, punching and kicking Mr. Jafari. Mr. Suneson said he had even more evidence against the rapper, including footage from CCTV cameras and witness statements. Rocky's case was initially treated as a minor incident, but rapidly escalated after the rapper was detained and tour dates were canceled. Pop stars including Justin Bieber shared a Change.org petition created by Rocky's team that demanded his release. More than 600,000 people have signed. As the clamor to free Rocky grew, the case made its way to the White House: On Saturday, Mr. Trump called Mr. Lofven, the Swedish prime minister, to discuss the rapper's detention.

Mr. Trump said on Twitter at the time that he had told the prime minister he would ""personally vouch"" for Rocky's bail if the rapper were to be released . Sweden has no system of bail, and usually keeps foreigners accused of crimes in detention because of the flight risk. There was no response from the Swedish embassy in Washington Thursday evening following Mr. Trump's latest tweets. But Mr. Lofven's office said in a statement on Saturday that he would not intervene, and that ""in Sweden everyone is equal before the law."" The storm has not settled despite Mr. Trump's attempts to resolve the case. ""I don't want to call the race card,"" Renee Black, Rocky's mother, told the gossip site TMZ on Monday, ""but that's what it's looking like."" ""If it walk like a duck and it quack like a duck, then it's a duck,"" she added. Lovette Jallow, a human-rights activist in Sweden and commentator on race issues, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that ""racism in Sweden is very problematic."" ""But it is not a case of racism in the ASAP Rocky case,"" she added. Prosecutors had also investigated Mr. Jafari on accusations of "" abuse and assault,"" after Rocky's bodyguard said the man had hit him during the altercation, but that case was dropped on Monday, the Swedish Prosecution Service said in a statement. The man did hit the bodyguard, the statement added, but in self-defense . Mr. Jovicic, Rocky's lawyer, said the rapper was ""under a dark cloud,"" but added that he and his legal team had ""good hope that we will get a result, and get him home soon."" He refused to consider the possibility that Rocky might be jailed for a lengthy period. ""Let's not talk about that now,"" he said. ""We are preparing for a trial.""","Hours after the rapper was formally charged with assault, the president called for him to be freed and criticized the Swedish prime minister.",a8c5b994-552c-5b52-b3f9-91718c8350ab,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/26/world/25ASAPRocky/25ASAPRocky-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=ea8c4d7d8cfbf3c3414c8af1794feb3939fb368fa5554afd36ea7aa4cd5b70f5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The rapper ASAP Rocky performing in New York last year.,a8c5b994-552c-5b52-b3f9-91718c8350ab,N24News/imgs/a8c5b994-552c-5b52-b3f9-91718c8350ab.jpg,12
Sports,"'When You Say Badminton, You Say Indonesia'",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/sports/badminton-indonesia.html,"There are 800 badminton clubs spread across Indonesia. Games -- both organized and informal -- are common sights around the country.Credit...



There are 800 badminton clubs spread across Indonesia. Games -- both organized and informal -- are common sights around the country.

JAKARTA -- Raja Sapta Oktohari, the muscular and youthful president of the Indonesian Olympic Committee, was finding it hard to contain his enthusiasm. Badminton, he explained in an interview early this year, is more than a casual pastime in his country. It is part of the country's social fabric, a game played by families in backyards and cramped public spaces and by shop workers waiting for clients. ""When you say badminton, you say Indonesia,"" Oktohari declared. ""That is how important it is."" So it was a blow to Indonesia's sporting culture when the Tokyo Olympics were postponed earlier this year because of the growing coronavirus pandemic. Badminton is the only sport in which Indonesia has won an Olympic gold medal, a feat its players have achieved seven times. It is, in an Olympic year, the only sport that matters here. The coronavirus has tested that commitment since The Times visited in February to document badminton's place in Indonesian life, but it hasn't dimmed it a bit. Slowly but surely, the game and its players are emerging from lockdown. For months, training centers and courts in Jakarta have been closed, but any easing of rules will revive familiar routines, even if coaching instructions will have to come from behind masks and face shields.

The Olympics, rescheduled for next year, are never far from the players' minds. The national squad recently held an internal tournament ""so they could not feel bored and can measure the results of training programs"" during the lockdown, one official said. Coaches and players hope Jakarta's clubs will rumble back to life soon, too, bringing the sport -- and its future -- out of its temporary hibernation. It is in those smaller gyms and neighborhoods where the sport that has been nurtured for decades by mentors like Christian Hadinata, a 70-year-old former world champion. In regular times, Hadinata could be found each weekday morning at 6 a.m. on the courts of the Djarum Badminton Club in Jakarta, waiting for his students to arrive. Uncle Chris, as Hadinata is known to the junior players, sees his contributions as paying back a debt to his sport, and his country, by passing on the learning of his lifetime. It is an obligation that Hadinata says he has felt since the Munich Olympics of 1972, when badminton was first presented as a demonstration sport. He won the men's doubles that summer, but it was a victory without a medal or an anthem and one, he said, that was quickly ""overwhelmed by the tragedy caused by Black September.""

When badminton was introduced two decades later as an official sport at the Barcelona Games, Indonesia won five medals. Susi Susanti, now the director of performance for the national team, became the first player to win gold for Indonesia, in the women's singles. As the Indonesian flag was raised during the medals ceremony, television cameras focused tightly on her as tears rolled down her face. Her boyfriend Alan Budikusuma, now her husband, won the men's singles competition a few days later. Only when they returned home, though, where they were greeted by huge crowds, did they understand how much their victories had meant to the country. They have since taken on the task of molding the country's next generation of champions. If anyone knows about the long path to success it is Susanti. In her early teens, she left home to move to Jakarta to live and train at one of the capital's powerhouse badminton clubs. It is a path still followed by many of the players who reach the national team. Liliyana Natsir, a four-time world champion who won gold in mixed-doubles at the 2016 Rio Games, was born in Manado, a port on the island of Sulawesi, and came to the Tangkas club in Jakarta at age 12. Though her parents did not play badminton, she said, her mother was a passionate follower of the sport, a woman who binge-watched games late at night while pregnant with Liliyana. ""She told me,"" Natsir said, ""that I must have been watching, too.""

Before each practice at the Tangkas club, the players are invited to say a prayer according to their religion. It is a tradition that is carried up to the highest levels, even at the training sessions of the national squad. The origin of the nation's love for the game is unclear. Badminton's rules were formalized in England at the end of the 19th century, and spread to Asia -- initially in India and Malaysia -- through British influence. Indonesia now has more than a million active club players, according to Achmad Budiharto, the secretary general of the country's national badminton association. Rudy Hartono argued it was Indonesia's first victory in the Thomas Cup, the international men's team competition, in 1958, that helped popularize the game. Hartono, still trim and elegant at the age of 70, said that victory inspired him to pursue a career in badminton; the game, he said, became ""my daily breakfast."" He grew up to become a world champion.","Badminton is part of the national identity.

Theater,Listening to the Best (and Worst) of Broadway,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/12/theater/listening-to-the-best-and-worst-of-broadway.html,"Though there were things I liked about ""Groundhog Day"" when it opened on Broadway in April, its score wasn't one of them. In my review, I may have used words like ""sloppy,"" ""thoughtless,"" ""baggy"" and ""lazy"" to describe some of the songs. Especially irksome to me were the lyrics, whose many off rhymes (like ""erection"" and ""reception"") were, I wrote, ""missed opportunities suggesting a wide array of indiscipline."" That was harsh, as the show's fans let me know in a series of responses that might best be summed up as: Shut up, grandpa. Listen to songs mentioned in this article here. But the show's songwriter, Tim Minchin, took a different approach. ""A challenge 4U,"" he tweeted. ""1) Listen to the album 3 times. 2) Talk to a songwriter about it. 3) Write about if/how it altered your opinion."" Recently I listened several times to ""Groundhog Day,"" and at least once each to the original cast albums of the 12 other new musicals that opened on Broadway during the 2016-17 season. I also listened to the recordings of two of the six musical revivals: ""Hello, Dolly!"" and ""Falsettos."" (""Cats,"" ""Miss Saigon"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"" wisely did not issue new recordings; ""Sunday in the Park With George"" won't be out until fall.)

[Watch performances by Christine Ebersole, Rachel Bay Jones and other female nominees at our Tony Awards In Performance concert] That I was able to get 15 recent shows so quickly onto my phone, even the disastrous ""Paramour,"" is the result of changes that have remade the cast album business over the past two decades. No longer do only the hit musicals, and those that someone bizarrely imagined would be hits, get recorded, as was the case in grandpa's youth. Now just about everything new, from Broadway to far Off, is preserved, regardless of merit or likely profit. Profit is, in fact, extremely unlikely, which is why the major labels have largely abandoned the business. But because recordings can be valuable to the underlying properties in other ways, helping them secure future lives in the regional and amateur markets, new labels and new business models have arisen to take the place of the old ones. Often the production, instead of the label, pays for the recording, as a loss leader. In some cases the authors themselves chip in: For them, a cast album is a talisman of creative achievement, much like a hardcover book. And like a hardcover book, ""cast album"" is starting to seem like a retronym. LPs are only available as collector's items, and even CDs are on their way out. Instead, new scores, or just individual tracks from them, are downloaded or streamed in digital format, often before a show has opened. They can then be played in any sequence or combination a listener may devise.

Certainly it has been good news for the 2015 behemoth ""Hamilton,"" whose recording now stands at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 chart, even after 93 weeks. This is astounding because the ranking, which takes into account sales, radio play and online streaming, covers all music genres. From the more recently ended season, only ""Dear Evan Hansen"" has charted as consistently. It is just the fourth cast album -- after ""Hamilton,"" ""The Book of Mormon"" and ""Hair"" -- to crack the top 10 in the past 50 years. But then ""Hamilton"" and ""Dear Evan Hansen"" are great musicals and great hits (and their albums were in fact released by major labels). They would have been successful, artistically and financially, even in the days of vinyl. On the other hand, the cast album of ""Paramour,"" with songs that seem to have been written by a monkey with a Casio keyboard and a random cliche generator, is good news only for Luddites. It argues for the days when far less was recorded. What about the rest of the pack? What do cast albums tell us about the state of the art, and what do they tell us about the shows they are based on? Mr. Minchin's challenge forced me to consider not only how his songs for ""Groundhog Day"" sounded after repeat exposure but also how listening to them in a nontheatrical context altered their texture. Among other things, I realized that a lot of the rhymes I hadn't liked onstage seemed harmless when I no longer needed to get information from them. But I still feel, and songwriters I spoke to agreed, that a show with such satirical heft would have benefited from the clean ping of exactly matched sounds. On the other hand, the songs whose musical structure I'd found ""baggy"" now seemed more compelling than they did in the theater, where the intensity of the action interfered with their reception. Relistening also enhanced my appreciation for ""Playing Nancy"" and ""Night Will Come,"" two songs I already liked. Onstage, sung by characters who were otherwise peripheral, they seemed dramatically unmoored. Listened to in the context of no context, they shone far brighter, if alone.

But if a show like ""Paramour"" (Cirque du Soleil) represents itself just as accurately by failing, the 13 other cast albums from last season fall between the unimprovable and the inexcusable, in three broad categories. ""Groundhog Day"" (Masterworks Broadway) is not the only recording that makes a more coherent case for its score than the production itself does. Four others do, too, including ""In Transit"" (Hollywood). Onstage, with its predictable subway sketches and its a cappella score, it seemed like a shotgun wedding of incompatible elements. Take away the sketches, and what you are left with is a smart set of songs with stupendous vocal arrangements and a knockout 11 o'clock number (""Getting There"") for Margo Seibert.

Four of the most-praised musicals of last season are so smart onstage that no cast album could do them justice. The best aspects of ""Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812"" (Reprise) -- Rachel Chavkin's staging and Mimi Lien's design -- are not capturable in a recording. Of course, this opinion comes from someone who has not been a huge fan of Dave Malloy's score in any of its prior incarnations. Its highlight, for me, is Pierre's song ""Dust and Ashes,"" added for the Broadway production to exploit the estimable talents of Josh Groban, who replaced Mr. Malloy in the part. The finale is also gorgeous, but not as gorgeous as when enhanced by the arrival, in the theater, of a ""real"" comet.","All 13 of last season's new Broadway shows, plus two revivals, produced cast recordings.

Health,Many Hospitals Charge Double or Even Triple What Medicare Would Pay,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/health/hospitals-prices-medicare.html,"The Parkview Health System in Indiana had among the highest overall hospital prices compared to Medicare rates, according to a study of 25 states' hospital pricing.

In Indiana, a local hospital system, Parkview Health, charged private insurance companies about four times what the federal Medicare program paid for the same care, according to a study of hospital prices in 25 states released on Thursday by the nonprofit RAND Corp. Colorado employers were shocked to learn they were paying nearly eight times what the federal government did for outpatient services like an emergency room visit, an X-ray or a checkup with a specialist at Colorado Plains Medical Center, northeast of Denver. Across the nation, hospitals treating patients with private health insurance were paid overall 2.4 times the Medicare rates in 2017, according to the RAND analysis. The difference was largest for outpatient care, where private prices were almost triple what Medicare would have paid. ""It's eye-opening, really, not just for the employers,"" said Gloria Sachdev, the chief executive of the Employers' Forum of Indiana, a coalition that helped with the study. ""It's eye-opening for the hospitals.""

The RAND study underscores the widening chasm between what the federal government and the private sector pay the nation's hospitals. The disparity shows how competition has faltered in an opaque market where the costs of care are secret and hospital systems are increasingly consolidated, gaining outsize clout in price negotiations with employers, some experts say. This yawning spread in hospital rates will likely fuel the debate over Medicare-for-all proposals that would give the federal government authority to decide what to pay hospitals and that have proved popular with many Democratic voters on the presidential campaign trail. The plans, especially one championed by Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, would provide universal coverage by replacing employer-based insurance with a government-run program. Some proponents of Medicare for all argue that employers and private insurers have failed to control costs. About one-third of all health care spending in the country goes to pay for hospital care. Many supporters point to the billions of dollars that could be saved annually if hospitals and doctors were paid at the much lower Medicare rates. ""The shadow of single payer hangs all over this,"" said Katherine Hempstead, a senior policy adviser at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which helped fund the RAND research.

Nationwide, employers provide coverage for most Americans under age 65, about 181 million people. And hospital care accounts for 44 cents of every personal health care dollar spent on those with private insurance. The RAND study shows ""market forces are clearly not working,"" said Richard Scheffler, a health economist at the University of California, Berkeley. ""Prices vary widely and are two and a half times higher than Medicare payment rates without any apparent reason,"" he said. The RAND researchers gathered information on 1,598 hospitals, about a third of the total number in the United States, using 4 million insurance claims from 2015 through 2017, a fraction of the total filed nationwide. The information was collected from employers, some insurers and state agencies. The study did not identify the employers, but researchers named individual hospitals through the information they obtained, a rare public listing. The claims included a variety of services, ranging from a hospital stay for heart surgery to an outpatient visit to the emergency room. The researchers compared the claim as it would have been reimbursed by Medicare and what the private insurer paid to determine the overall difference in prices. The hospitals did not see the study before it was released. The Indiana system, Parkview, says it is adopting new kinds of contracts. ""At Parkview Health, we think the most important conversation is around what we can do moving forward, in strategic alignment with employers and insurance companies, to provide the highest quality care at the best cost,"" said the company's chief executive, Mike Packnett, in a statement.

Colorado Plains Medical Center did not respond to requests for comment. In New York and Pennsylvania, private prices were less than two times the Medicare rates. Indiana, which has the highest private prices among the 25 states analyzed, pays roughly three times what Medicare does. Many businesses that contract with insurance companies have no idea what their insurers are paying individual hospitals in their plan's network. ""We've never seen what was agreed upon,"" said Jennifer Fairman, the benefits manager for people who work for Larimer County in Colorado. ""We've been signing these blank checks."" But soaring hospital costs have become a significant burden, and many businesses have off-loaded more of the expense onto their employees through higher premiums and deductibles. Families have struggled to cope with surprise medical bills and increasing out-of-pocket costs. The trend toward consolidation in the last several years has also spurred higher costs, as hospitals merged into bigger, more powerful systems that dominated their local markets, demanding ever-higher prices. Unlike Medicare, which sets the price it will pay for a type of care, insurers often try to negotiate discounts with hospitals over charges, especially for outpatient services, said Chapin White, an adjunct senior policy researcher at RAND and one of the authors of the study. The insurers don't have a strong incentive to demand the lowest prices because many, working for employers that are self-insured, are ""literally spending someone else's money,"" he said. Insurers are also frequently paid based on how much the employer spends; they take in more revenue when the employer spends more. Insurers say they are motivated to keep hospital prices low and point to the battles they sometimes have over whether a high-priced system will be in their networks.

Hospital prices are not always linked to overall costs, however. In Michigan, for example, insurance premiums are relatively high, even though hospital prices are low. In contrast to private insurers, ""Medicare has been much more zealous about keeping its payments down,"" said Sherry Glied, dean of the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University. Hospitals argue that they lose money under Medicare, and many say they are aggressively trying to lower costs. Paying the hospitals at Medicare rates would have a significant impact on the industry, causing many hospitals to close, according to some experts. ""Medicare payment rates, which reimburse below the cost of care, should not be held as a standard benchmark for hospital prices,"" said Melinda Hatton, general counsel for the American Hospital Association, an industry trade group, in an emailed statement. ""Simply shifting to prices based on artificially low Medicare payment rates would strip vital resources from already strapped communities, seriously impeding access to care."" Policy experts say the hospitals have come to rely on higher payments from employers and insurers. ""The whole system is symbiotic,"" Ms. Glied said. If private insurers paid the hospitals less, they ""would look different and have a different cost structure."" But some critics say hospitals are clearly flush and that private insurers are paying too much. ""It explains some of the market behaviors we've seen,"" said Robert J. Smith, executive director of the Colorado Business Group on Health, which represents employers. Although the hospitals in his state are only two-thirds full, they are building new facilities and buying physician practices.

The purpose of the research, Ms. Hempstead said, was to arm employers with information about prices. While previous efforts focused on giving consumers information so they could be smarter shoppers, employers are the ones that can benefit, she said. ""The real consumers are the employers,"" she said.

 Employers can use Medicare as a starting point for how much they should be paying the hospitals, for example, or combine information about the quality of individual hospitals with the prices they charge to steer workers to those facilities that offer the best value. ""What was missing was price,"" said Ms. Sachdev of the Indiana employers group. In Indiana, where a pilot study on hospital prices led to the Rand research, the realization that insurers were paying so much has already altered how insurers are contracting with hospitals. Anthem, the for-profit insurer headquartered there that operates the state's Blue Cross plan, now uses Medicare as a basis for how much it will agree to pay the hospitals. Anthem says it is now developing new networks made up of significantly fewer hospitals and will steer people to places that deliver the best quality at lower prices, said Paul Marchetti, a senior vice president at Anthem. ""That's where we are headed as a company,"" he said. But employers are still paying much higher prices than the government. ""We should not be allowing this,"" said Mr. Smith, with the Colorado employer group. It plans to combine pricing information with quality data so businesses can better judge the value of care at individual hospitals. It will be up to the employers to prove that they can exert discipline on controlling health care costs, which he called an open question: ""Can the U.S. market become more effective or more efficient or do we need a single payer?""",A study of 25 states provides a rare glimpse of the stark disparities between what private insurers and the federal government paid for inpatient and outpatient care.,3a42b526-cc59-5433-ba8d-b5250343033c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/10/science/10HOSPITALS/09HOSPITALS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=b905d0caf72b5bdd650861f8dbcb531737a552170b8085a882fcfa813a9419b8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Parkview Health System in Indiana had among the highest overall hospital prices compared to Medicare rates, according to a study of 25 states&rsquo; hospital pricing.",3a42b526-cc59-5433-ba8d-b5250343033c,N24News/imgs/3a42b526-cc59-5433-ba8d-b5250343033c.jpg,1
Technology,Spending Is as Easy as Pushing a Button. The Hard Part? Keeping Track.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/technology/personaltech/spending-is-as-easy-as-pushing-a-button-the-hard-part-keeping-track.html,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Tara Siegel Bernard, a personal finance reporter, discussed the tech she's using. What are your most important tech tools for tracking budgets? This may sound strange coming from a personal finance reporter, but I'm not a big fan of traditional budgets -- I don't think they work. I try to keep my own spending in check by taking the reverse approach. Instead of tracking every dollar, I focus on what we need to save for: retirement, college or some other goal. After you've automated your savings goals and created a bit of a cushion for emergencies, you're freer to spend without thinking too hard or feeling too guilty. It's an imperfect system, but it's better than a failed budget. That method won't necessarily work in all situations, especially if you need to tackle debt or establish a stricter spending plan in retirement. And everyone can benefit from tracking personal spending, even if you do it only for a few months or check in only every quarter. Mint has been around for a while, but it is still a solid way to take stock of where all of your money is going and whether your net worth is moving in the right direction. It also allows you to create a budget, and alerts you when you've spent too much. I use it infrequently, and there's usually at least one kink I need to work out whenever I log in; most recently, it counted all of my retirement accounts twice, which was kind of cruel.

Personal Capital, an investment advisory service, also has a robust free tool that tracks your spending, cash flow and retirement goals all in one place with minimal effort. For people who want a more proactive approach to spending and whittling down debt, there's You Need a Budget. I've come across many people in my reporting who have attested that it's life-changing. Which basic tools would you recommend for people to increase their savings and investments? It's not so much a tool but a technology: automation. After you've settled on a low-cost investment provider such as Vanguard, automation is the surest way to set yourself up for success. Automate as much as you can -- your Roth I.R.A. contributions, your kids' 529 college savings accounts. If you have an employer-provided retirement plan like a 401(k), see if it will allow you to automatically increase the percentage you're saving each year. If not, set a date in your electronic calendar to remind you to revisit all of those amounts annually. I also like the little revolution that the roboadvisers have started. They lean heavily on technology to help invest and manage your money, though more of them are increasingly integrating human advisers. Betterment and Wealthfront have free tools that will let you play with various goals and savings amounts to see how long it will take you to save what you need.

There are a ton of money apps for children and teenagers, but I was hoping to find something to help him focus on developing patience and delaying gratification. Today, bags of groceries magically appear on our doorstep without any visible transaction. If we need something, we can just press a button -- as adults, we're a month removed from any consequences, and children are often completely unaware that there was any exchange at all. Stuff just arrives when you want it. To help acquaint my son with the reality of how all of this works, I decided to pay him an allowance of $5 a week. Instead of putting it in physical ""save, spend and give"" jars, he's tracking the same categories on an iPad. I scanned a few different apps, but the simplicity of PiggyBot seemed well suited for younger children. He immediately set a goal to buy two of those books -- but he's going to have to wait nine weeks to get them. (I also told him that we could just go to the library.) Outside your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with? I live a pretty low-tech life. We listen to music through Sonos and watch television through a four-year-old Roku device, though we haven't entirely cut the cord because my husband is a soccer fan . I did recently learn that we can hand in our cable box and pay a little less, while keeping access to cable channels through Roku, though you lose the ability to record. There are also several apps that I use daily or weekly. I always have roughly five dozen tabs open on my computer screen, as well as stories I come across on Twitter that I want to read later. To minimize the clutter, I save everything to the Pocket app, which I'll read on my commute. I also keep a to-do list on the iPhone ""reminders"" app. I also love Ink and Postagram for turning my children's photos into cards for relatives, all from my aging iPhone 6s, which has started to shut down in the cold. I have a long wish list of apps, but I really want more sophisticated tools that would help us become smarter consumers. I want to enter a product name into an app so it can assure me that we're not feeding our children weed killer in their oatmeal.

Lots of web writers talk about the so-called FIRE, which stands for ""financial independence, retire early."" People are retiring as early as their 30s. What do you think about this movement? We can all learn something from folks like Mr. Money Mustache, who is credited with popularizing the idea of hyper-frugal, anti-consumerist living and saving a significant chunk of your salary so you can either retire early or pursue more rewarding work. But the movement started with a lot of technology workers -- and it's a lot easier to save half your salary when you're a well-paid software engineer with health insurance and no debt. Sure, these folks had to exercise discipline and restraint. But they had the luxury of exercising that discipline; there are so many people living on much less and struggling to pay for health insurance, rent, child care and student loans or to keep full-time jobs with chronic conditions. It also raises a lot of questions: How do they pay for health care? Will the money really last as long as they need it? A lot of research shows a portfolio may last around 30 years if you withdraw 4 percent of the initial retirement portfolio balance, and then adjust that dollar amount for inflation annually. So when you start looking at longer time horizons -- or a 50-year or 60-year retirement -- it's increasingly possible to run out of money if you don't make adjustments. But it's easy to see why so many people find the movement intriguing and why it has become such a popular story line. You can't help but wonder what it took to achieve financial security so early, so you click and hope to learn something.","Tara Siegel Bernard, a personal finance reporter, recommends apps for budgeting, investments and helping little ones as young as 6 understand the value of money.",1ff37ed5-e9bb-546d-b553-1c8d25afcaa0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/13/business/13techusing1/13techusing1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=87bb1327d5e5691889645b917714046279de9d637e29c2dcc6ef39b670da799d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Tara Siegel Bernard, a personal finance reporter, said Mint and Personal Capital offered useful tools for managing spending and financial goals.",1ff37ed5-e9bb-546d-b553-1c8d25afcaa0,N24News/imgs/1ff37ed5-e9bb-546d-b553-1c8d25afcaa0.jpg,20
Technology,A Hardware Renaissance Grows in Brooklyn — and Elsewhere,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/technology/new-york-startups-hardware-brooklyn.html,"StrongArm Technologies, a start-up company in Brooklyn, makes ""ergo-skeletons"" that look a bit like futuristic versions of the back support belts that warehouse workers often wear. Sensors embedded in the devices monitor a worker's movements, and artificial intelligence software uses that information to suggest rest, stretching or posture changes -- an automated safety coach for preventing back injuries. StrongArm, a fledgling outfit with just 20 employees, is one of a new wave of start-ups making all sorts of devices that offer a glimpse of the future for the manufacturing of high-tech hardware in America's cities. The company's home in Brooklyn is a vast, renovated industrial building, where World War II battleships were once made. Now it is dedicated to commercializing digital-age hardware start-ups.

New Lab, a public-private partnership, opened the doors to the 84,000-square-foot space last June. It now hosts 80 companies across a range of industries and in various stages of development, but they typically have three to 20 employees. Vincent Tullo for The New York Times On Thursday, New Lab announced that 14 of its companies, including StrongArm, are joining an urban technology initiative with the New York City Economic Development Corporation. The goal is to generate technology for urban challenges ranging from traffic congestion to local food cultivation. ""We want them to not only make technology in New York, but to deploy it in New York City,"" said Alicia Glen, New York's deputy mayor for economic development. That you don't have to be a giant company to have a good hardware idea has been evident for years at Maker Faire events, where inventors showcase their homemade engineering projects. Last year, more than one million people attended Maker Faire events worldwide.

But progress in hardware -- the messy physical world -- tends to take longer than in the digital-only realm of software. For a decade now, cloud computing and open-source software have drastically lowered the cost of starting a software company. So the number of software start-ups has surged. Now, it seems, is the time for hardware, where a similar phenomenon is getting underway. It is helped by the software trend, but it is really driven by new hardware tools like 3-D printing and laser cutters as well as low-cost, open-source hardware that allows for rapid prototyping that accelerates the pace of development. The hardware start-ups tend to be clustered in urban settings like San Francisco, Boston and New York. The Urban Manufacturing Alliance, a nonprofit community development organization created in 2011, now has about 550 members representing more than 150 cities. There are signs that manufacturing employment in cities has stabilized, and is reviving in places. After steadily declining for three decades, the number of manufacturing jobs in New York increased by 3,000 from 2011 to 2015, to more than 78,000, the most recent figure available.



But there are signs of a groundswell of high-tech hardware start-ups, beyond breakout companies like the electric carmaker Tesla and Nest Labs, the digital thermostat company, which Google bought for $3.2 billion and is now a subsidiary of the parent company, Alphabet. Funding is becoming more plentiful from traditional venture capitalists, the venture arms of major corporations and venture funds that are dedicated to hardware start-ups, like Bolt and Lemnos Labs. The companies in New Lab, for example, have raised more than $250 million. For most companies in New Lab, the Brooklyn center is headquarters, and where their design and development are done. As the hardware start-ups grow, how much manufacturing will be done in the city is an open question. StrongArm, for example, is starting to gain momentum, having sold more than 4,000 units of its digital safety wear in the last couple of years. Its manufacturing is done by contractors, one in an industrial district elsewhere in New York City and another in upstate New York.

""What we do requires a ton of equipment, and that's what got us in the door,"" said Sean Petterson, the company's 26-year-old co-founder and chief executive. A handful of corporate partners, including General Electric, Intel, JetBlue, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Autodesk, have signed up to work with the New Lab start-ups in various ways. The cities of Copenhagen and Barcelona, Spain, also plan joint innovation programs with the Brooklyn hardware center. And New Lab says it is setting up a fund, New Lab Ventures, to invest in its companies, with a goal of raising $50 million. Beth Comstock, vice chairwoman of G.E., who is in charge of new business development, has visited New Lab several times. Ms. Comstock even did a video interview with Andrew Shearer, chief executive of Farmshelf, a New Lab start-up that is using sensors and software to develop hardware units for locally grown food. ""We need to be constantly learning, connecting with new companies coming up, and seeing new business models earlier,"" Ms. Comstock said.

New Lab itself began as a test-and-learn start-up. In 2013, it created a ""beta"" space nearby in the Brooklyn Navy Yard in a building with 8,000 square feet. ""It wasn't obvious that companies would want to come here,"" said David Belt, chief executive of New Lab. But come they did. New Lab has fielded more than 400 applications to select its 80 companies. An idea and enthusiasm are not enough to make the grade. Companies, Mr. Belt explained, must have a product and usually a seed round of funding. Mr. Belt and his partner at New Lab, Scott Cohen, also recruited companies they thought could contribute a lot to their hardware community and mentor younger outfits. Nanotronics Imaging was one of them. The company, founded in 2010, grew out of the research of Matthew Putman, then a scientist at Columbia University. Its automated microscopes employ artificial intelligence and robotics to analyze and detect flaws in high-tech manufacturing for semiconductor, aerospace and other industries. Nanotronics has raised more money than any other New Lab company, $41 million, and its investors include Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel. Nanotronics started in Ohio, and it still has an office there, but its headquarters are now in Brooklyn, where it does its design work and employs 20 of its 60 employees. It operates a factory in Hollister, Calif. In addition to the 3-D printers and other prototyping equipment at New Lab, Justin Stanwix, chief revenue officer at Nanotronics, said a vital asset of the Brooklyn work space was the connections and idea-swapping to improve manufacturing, tap investors and manage intellectual property. ""That really helps mitigate the risks for these start-up companies,"" Mr. Stanwix said.","Technology, investors and entrepreneurs are behind a groundswell of innovation in hardware. A Brooklyn center dedicated to commercializing hardware start-ups shows the trend.",9ac2533e-aec4-5c3b-a002-393fd13a1d95,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/28/business/28MAKE/28MAKE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=4a742003385f67f521a9a18c363ca9f0e1223b40895fa64141df4f8e9df2bc91&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"New Lab, a public-private partnership, opened an 84,000-square-foot renovated industrial building in Brooklyn that hosts 80 companies.",9ac2533e-aec4-5c3b-a002-393fd13a1d95,N24News/imgs/9ac2533e-aec4-5c3b-a002-393fd13a1d95.jpg,20
Technology,Funding Talks at Uber and Lyft Complicate Ride-Hailing Allegiances,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/technology/uber-lyft-fundraising.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- The only thing changing faster than who is winning the race in the cutthroat world of ride hailing are the shifting behind-the-scenes allegiances between those companies and investors. At the moment, Uber, the ride-hailing behemoth, is nearing a deal to receive billions of dollars in funding from SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate, according to three people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential. SoftBank is one of the largest investors in Didi Chuxing, one of Uber's largest former foes. Didi also happens to be a major investor in Lyft, Uber's biggest American rival. And, according to three people familiar with the discussions, Lyft has held recent talks to raise funding from Alphabet, whose venture capital arm also happens to be a major shareholder in Uber. The tangled state of affairs has made for strange bedfellows, and has helped to forge occasional alliances between companies. But it has also put companies in difficult positions when they have to decide which investors to accept money from -- and what strings may be attached.

""If you believe the ride-share industry is big enough, you believe that even if you have a losing investment in one of the two competitors, the winner will be big enough to justify the loss,"" said Quin Garcia, managing director of Autotech Ventures, a firm that invests in ground transportation start-ups and has invested in Lyft. Representatives of SoftBank, Uber, Lyft and Alphabet declined to comment. Bloomberg earlier reported Lyft's discussions with Alphabet. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported some details of the Uber and SoftBank talks. Uber's position is perhaps the most precarious. As the San Francisco-based company has spent the past nine months grappling with scandal after scandal over its culture and business practices, competitors like Lyft and Ola have gained traction in key markets. Last month, Uber appointed a new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, to help right the ship.

Uber may see a lifeline in SoftBank. In recent weeks, the companies have been in discussions for SoftBank to take a large stake in Uber -- in the neighborhood of 17 percent or more -- with an investment of $10 billion, said the people close to the talks. The money would come from SoftBank's so-called Vision Fund, a $100 billion fund that is used specifically to invest in technology start-ups across multiple industries.

Complicating the talks are the many strings attached to a potential deal. SoftBank is angling to invest in Uber at a steep discount to the company's nearly $70 billion valuation. SoftBank has agreed to buy some new shares at the same valuation, but would also participate in a tender offer sent to existing Uber investors, in which the Japanese company could potentially buy their Uber shares at a price that is cheaper than the ride-hailing service's last valuation. For Uber, SoftBank could be a potentially powerful ally. SoftBank's new capital could aid Uber's expensive expansion efforts in regions like Southeast Asia and Latin America. The money could also go toward cashing out existing investors and employees, who have not been able to sell their stock since Uber is a privately held company. If no agreement is reached, SoftBank could also pose a significant threat to Uber. In a meeting with Uber investors this week, Rajeev Misra, leader of SoftBank's Vision Fund, said SoftBank would be willing to invest in a rival like Lyft if Uber did not agree to SoftBank's terms, according to two people familiar with the conversation. Those terms included demands like the heavily discounted share price, and two seats on Uber's board of directors. Lyft's recent fund-raising activities have also complicated the calculus for Uber. Lyft closed a $500 million financing round in April, with support from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the private equity firm. More recently, Lyft has held talks with Alphabet for a new $1 billion investment, according to people familiar with the discussions. It is unclear what the status of those talks are, though the discussions appear to be driven by Larry Page, Alphabet's chief executive, the people said. Lyft could use any new funding to keep pressure on Uber in its most lucrative market, North America, by offering subsidized trips to riders. An investment would also strengthen Lyft's relationship with Alphabet, which has emerged as one of Uber's most powerful foes. In May, Lyft reached a deal to work on a self-driving-vehicle pilot program with Waymo, Alphabet's autonomous-vehicle subsidiary. Waymo sued Uber this year, claiming stolen trade secrets in driverless-car technology. ""Ride sharing is starting to look more like a business that will be regionally dominated by local duopolies and monopolies,"" Mr. Garcia said. ""Until the winners shake out, the companies will use money from the same investors to cannibalize one another.""","With Uber reportedly nearing a deal with SoftBank and Lyft having held discussions with Alphabet, alliances are shifting quickly in the industry.",47d384a9-a25c-565c-8dc8-2927b5757866,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/16/business/16ride1/16ride1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=5b7b83018d502ba9247c5736ca076b229c25311305215df2517e5fbbfd8d82ce&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Discussions by Uber and Lyft with potential funding partners illustrate the tangled connections in the ride-hailing business.,47d384a9-a25c-565c-8dc8-2927b5757866,N24News/imgs/47d384a9-a25c-565c-8dc8-2927b5757866.jpg,20
Style,"Michou, Whose Drag Cabaret Was the Toast of Paris, Dies at 88",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/style/michou-dead.html,"Michou, Whose Drag Cabaret Was the Toast of Paris, Dies at 88

Michou, a flamboyant fixture of the Parisian demimonde who ran France's most celebrated drag cabaret for more than a half-century, died on Sunday night in a hospital in Saint-Mande, a suburb of Paris. He was 88. The cause was a pulmonary embolism, said Francois Deblaye, Michou's press representative. ""He hadn't been able to breathe very well for a while,"" he said. Last year, Michou was treated for colon cancer, which was said to be in remission. It was in 1956 that Michou -- born Michel Georges Alfred Catty -- opened his tiny jewel box of a nightclub at the foot of Montmartre, the storied Paris neighborhood known for its nightclubs and connection with artists like Picasso and Toulouse-Lautrec. Dressed habitually in blue, with a snowy white coif, manicured fingernails, a perpetually wide smile and a glass of Champagne always in hand, Michou was instantly recognizable in France, in part from his many television appearances. His death was front page news in France.

In Montmartre he was known for holding free luncheons for elderly residents. Cafes there engraved his name on plaques on his favorite seats, permanently reserving them for him. Local residents often blew kisses at him as he walked to his cabaret from his apartment overlooking Sacre Coeur, the basilica at the heart of Montmartre. ""They call me the 'Blue Prince of Montmartre,'"" Michou told The New York Times in an interview last March. (Even his home was decorated entirely in shades of blue, right down to a turquoise toilet seat.) ""Around here, I'm treated like a saint.""

Prominent politicians, actors and singers were his friends, and his cabaret was lined with photos of him hugging the likes of Sophia Loren and Jacques Chirac, who as president of France had awarded him the Legion of Honor, the country's highest order of merit. He was a close friend of first ladies of France, including Brigitte Macron, President Emmanuel Macron's wife, who, like Michou, hailed from Amiens, an industrial town in northern France.

Chez Michou's big draw was a colorful spectacle called ""transformiste,"" featuring a parade of performers in drag impersonating female luminaries of bygone eras, like the diva Maria Callas and Dalida, the Egyptian-born singer and actress from the 1950s. Night after night, the cabaret was packed with visitors from around France and from around the world. As one of Paris's most famous openly gay performers, Michou left another cultural mark: ""He helped open doors to liberate others,"" Francois Soustre, a French writer who is the co-author of an autobiography of Michou, told The Times last March. Michel Georges Alfred Catty was born in June 1931 in Amiens and raised by his mother and a grandmother. At age 19, he wrote, he told his mother he was attracted to men. ""What would you say if I was a homosexual?"" he recalled asking her. Her support gave Michou confidence to leave Amiens and make his way to Paris, where he settled near the legendary Moulin Rouge cabaret. He found work at a cafe on Rue des Martyrs. After befriending the owner, he eventually bought the cafe from her, transforming it into a dinner theater featuring himself and two friends as dancers.

""I did the cooking, the cleaning and the dancing,"" he said. Michou famously avoided drinking water, preferring to hydrate himself with up to two bottles of Champagne a day -- a habit that, by his account, once prompted a former first lady, Bernadette Chirac, a close friend, to admonish him. He replied: ""I don't smoke, and I don't do drugs. At least leave me the pleasure of Champagne!"" He is survived by his longtime companion, Erwann Toularastel; a half sister, Micheline; and a niece, Catherine Baudelin.","Since 1956, his jewel box of a club in storied Montmartre has drawn a host of luminaries, turning the proprietor himself into one.",b1d9bf1b-7492-5d8d-8025-6fee62dc4c0c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/28/obituaries/27Michou4/27Michou4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=677252664870e1e74082bda1f6c764c2c2b5540c3d7d8f16aad637c43afe45f2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Michou, in foreground, was flanked by the performer Silvestre, left, and the composer Georges Garvarentz at Chez Michou in 1986.

Quora discovered the data breach on Friday, the company's chief executive, Adam D'Angelo, wrote in a blog post, and it is still investigating how it happened.

""It is our responsibility to make sure things like this don't happen, and we failed to meet that responsibility,"" Mr. D'Angelo wrote.

The company noted that the incident was unlikely to result in identity theft, as the site does not collect sensitive information such as credit card or Social Security numbers.

Real Estate,Coping With a Neighbor's Renovation,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/realestate/how-to-cope-with-a-neighbors-renovation.html,"Elisabeth Cunnick's house in Brooklyn Heights is next to a lot that will soon cease to be vacant. As a precaution, she hired a lawyer to help negotiate a construction agreement with the owner.

Dan Kramer found out his new neighbor was planning extensive renovations last summer when he overheard an architect talking in the backyard next door. Within a few weeks, the reality of how this project was going to affect him literally hit home. ""A brick had fallen down into a chimney stack, hit an obstruction, then burst through the plaster in my wall because it fell two flights,"" he said. ""It came in right next to a laundry machine and almost hit my friend."" Mr. Kramer, who lives in the West Village in a 19th-century brownstone, is facing a problem increasingly common in the 21st, as homeowners renovate old buildings that share walls and foundational support -- namely, how to protect your property (and sanity) when a neighbor does major construction. People living next door to a house or apartment undergoing a serious makeover must deal with noise, dust, debris, and disruptions that can last for months, if not years, each one causing its share of headaches. But for owners of houses, the demolition process can also affect structural integrity, especially when developers dig deeper to gain space, because height restrictions prevent properties from growing taller. If not handled correctly, that process can cause adjacent homes to settle, so doors no longer shut properly and floors start to slope.

According to Mr. Kramer, contractors had not received the proper permission before they started removing bricks from the party wall he and his neighbor share. His neighbor, Ara K. Hovnanian, a real estate developer, is removing a rear addition, lowering the cellar floor and adding a penthouse, work that Mr. Kramer says has already caused leaks in his ceiling, the close call with the brick, and other damage, prompting him to hire a lawyer. ""Now we're in the process of entering into a very detailed agreement about responsibility for damages and anything else that goes wrong,"" he said. Robert Banner, a partner at Ingram Yuzek Gainen Carroll & Bertolotti who specializes in construction law, is helping Mr. Kramer negotiate that agreement, which covers issues like hiring a structural engineer to assess the state of Mr. Kramer's building, and installing crack and vibration monitors. Chris McCabe, a lawyer representing Mr. Hovnanian, declined to comment on the situation. Mr. Banner recommends that adjacent homeowners ask to be added to the renovating neighbor's insurance policy, and also have their own architect or engineer review the construction plans. That is especially important if your neighbor plans to dig a lower level deeper than yours, as it may require shoring up your foundation. ""When you go down deep,"" Mr. Banner said, ""you're creating an avenue for whatever is under the adjacent person's building -- soil or gravel -- to flow a little bit. The adjacent owner's property could move. That's the biggest fear.""

Having worked for renovators and their neighbors, he has empathy for the parties on both sides of the construction fence. ""There's the issue of vibration and how that may shake an adjacent building and loosen cornices or stone sills or even the foundation,"" he said. ""There's also the opposite situation, where nothing is going wrong and just because of adversarial neighbors or hypersensitivity to the construction, the mind starts to imagine all these problems that might have already been there."" Mr. Tortorella says that's why it is in the renovator's interest to do a preconstruction survey of adjacent buildings, and especially to document the conditions inside neighbors' homes. ""Take as many pictures as possible,"" he advised. ""Otherwise, you'll pay for every crack that's there."" Of course, to do a preconstruction survey, one would need permission to enter the neighbor's property, which is one source of leverage for anyone living next to a potential construction site.

""They may need to access your land; they may need to come in on your roof,"" said Elisabeth Cunnick, the owner of a nearly 200-year-old wooden house in Brooklyn Heights that is about to have company in the empty lot next door. To lessen the impact of watching a 9,000-square-foot building go up out the windows of her more modest home, Ms. Cunnick moved for a year to a studio in Manhattan. But the project was delayed and she has now moved back to Brooklyn just as construction is to begin. Since her lot is wider than her house, she is having a new survey made of the boundaries and has hired Mr. Banner to help negotiate an agreement with her neighbor. She also removed a chandelier, packed away most of her books to protect them from dust, and took artwork off the walls to avoid damage from vibrations from pile-drilling next door. Even more important than minimizing the stress of living side by side with construction, she said, is preserving her historic home. ""When you live in a house this old,"" she explained, ""it's like living in a big piece of 19th-century furniture. I would like to do everything I can to protect it. I don't know exactly what that is, but I'm trying to figure it out as I go."" The lot next door to Ms. Cunnick is owned by SDS 155 Lincoln L.L.C. Louis Greco, the company's manager, said, ""It's always very difficult to build next to an existing residence, but the laws are specific, and just being a good neighbor is paramount.""

Andrew Berman, the executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation (gvshp.org), recommends that people concerned about a renovation project first try to communicate with the neighbor who is doing the work, and then become involved in the permit-approval process. ""In cases where it's a landmark property,"" he said, ""the application to do the work often has to go through a much more public process than if it were not a landmark property."" The society's Web site lists applications submitted to the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission for properties in Greenwich Village, the East Village and other nearby neighborhoods; it includes dates on which the local community board or the preservation commission will consider these applications. Interested neighbors can sign up to receive e-mail notifications of updates to the status of an application for a particular address. Mr. Berman says showing up at community board meetings, at which renovation proposals are often publicly presented, is one way for a neighbor to voice any concerns. ""The problem is, often times people don't hear about these applications until after it's gone through the community board process,"" he said, adding that community boards issue only recommendations, as opposed to having a decision-making capacity. ""But they may be willing to say, 'We don't approve this unless you take these precautions to protect your adjacent property owner.' ""

* Hidden Feats: Our critic looks at some supertall N.Y.C. buildings and how the ingenuity of engineers helped build landmarks. The New York City Department of Buildings (nyc.gov/buildings) also offers resources for neighbors concerned about construction. On its Web site, you can enter an address and get information about jobs that have been filed for it, a record of any complaints or violations, and whether they have been resolved.

But homeowners say the site can be difficult to navigate if you are in search of useful information like plans, and some of the terminology can be hard to decipher if you're not a builder or an architect. Anthony Sclafani, a department spokesman, says that plans are generally available at borough offices after a project has been approved, but that interested parties can find a rendering of the proposed changes by looking up the zoning document. (After entering the property's address at the building department Web site, click on ""jobs/filings,"" select the most recent filing, choose the ""virtual jobs folder,"" then select ""zoning document-ZD1."") The city has introduced a mobile app (available for iPhone and Android devices) that provides access to building data. Using these digital tools, neighbors can find out whether the city has issued an after-hours variance permit for a construction project, allowing work outside the normal hours of 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday.

Eva Talel, a partner in the law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, says these agreements vary, but should include details like how long the construction will last, what hours it is to be allowed, how the work will be monitored, what dust containment measures will be taken, how much the security deposit will cost, and what the insurance requirements will be. One agreement she negotiated -- to be used by a building's managing agent for all renovation projects, so every shareholder is subject to the same rules -- is nearly 70 pages. ""The list of horrible things that can happen in the course of alterations is endless,"" Ms. Talel said, citing a minor paint job that turned into a fire when a worker left a blowtorch too close to the paint. ""Not only was that apartment gutted by the fire, but the neighbors suffered smoke and water damage after the fire department came."" Even though most renovations cause neighbors only temporary distress, she said, having an agreement can prevent problems like the lack of proper soundproofing in a new floor, as well as provide a path to a resolution if something does go wrong. ""It can end up in a lot of contentiousness,"" she said of the building process, ""which is not what one wants in a multifamily living arrangement."" Next-door neighbors living in houses also have a delicate relationship to navigate. One woman who lives with her husband in an early 19th-century house in TriBeCa says they now regret not having asked for a written agreement when their neighbor began extensive renovations. Although everyone started out with good intentions, and both sides tried to be accommodating when problems arose (like cracks in the walls and doors that would no longer open), she said good will eroded as the project dragged on for years.

Speaking anonymously to avoid further discord, she suggested that anyone in a similar situation with a neighbor ""get things in writing -- and find a structural engineer that you trust and believe is on your side."" But there are inevitably risks when centuries-old buildings are subject to the side effects of major construction, and not all damage can be repaired. ""We know that our house changed, and it has changed forever,"" she said. ""That's not something that can be quantified.""",How to protect your property when a neighbor is doing major construction.,4b857559-f9b3-562a-b0fe-8d29569b0cd2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/04/14/realestate/14SUBJUMP1/sub-jump1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=9d9ca1a68d75d529275cd3454eca3ef81f6784414833260bc5b4692fbd525614&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Elisabeth Cunnick removed artwork from the walls of her house to protect it from vibrations from any drilling that may occur.,4b857559-f9b3-562a-b0fe-8d29569b0cd2,N24News/imgs/4b857559-f9b3-562a-b0fe-8d29569b0cd2.jpg,7

Technology,Chief of Apple Stores Is Leaving After 5 Years in the Job,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/technology/apple-stores-angela-ahrendts.html,"Chief of Apple Stores Is Leaving After 5 Years in the Job

Angela Ahrendts, the former Burberry chief hired by Apple five years ago to oversee its stores, said Tuesday that she would leave the company in April. The departure is an unusual move for a top executive at Apple, which is facing retail challenges as sales in China have dropped and iPhone sales have turned sluggish. Ms. Ahrendts, 58, was one of Apple's most prominent hires when the Silicon Valley company lured her from Burberry with an initial $73 million pay package in 2014. She had spent eight years as Burberry's chief executive and was credited with expanding it into an international fashion brand. Over five years, Ms. Ahrendts was among Apple's highest-paid executives, earning more than $170 million, according to securities filings.

Apple said in a news release that she was leaving ""for new personal and professional pursuits."" One of Ms. Ahrendts's primary goals was to improve Apple's online retail operation so it was as admired as its sleek, minimalist stores. She generally succeeded, allowing customers, for example, to order online and pick up items in a store, said Neil Cybart, an independent Apple analyst. Mr. Cybart said that Apple's stores remained among the most lucrative in the world by square foot, and that traffic to them had been steady. ""I don't necessarily see any huge red flags,"" he said while discussing the circumstances of Ms. Ahrendts's exit. Under Ms. Ahrendts, Apple started offering more public talks, concerts and seminars at its stores in an attempt to draw in customers who weren't necessarily in the market for a new device. ""It's funny. We actually don't call them stores anymore,"" Ms. Ahrendts said at an Apple event in 2017. ""We call them town squares."" She was later criticized for suggesting that a store with $1,000 products could be a community gathering place.

Ms. Ahrendts said in a statement that ""the last five years have been the most stimulating, challenging and fulfilling of my career."" Deirdre O'Brien, Apple's human resources chief, will take over management of the retail operation in addition to her current duties, the company said. She has worked for Apple for three decades. Ms. O'Brien, 52, is a surprising choice as the new retail chief, given her already heavy load handling human resources for more than 100,000 employees. She will add responsibilities that include ""strategy, real estate and development, and operations of Apple's physical stores, Apple's online store and contact centers,"" according to Apple's website. Apple was probably willing to give her such a large role to keep retail in the hands of a company veteran, Mr. Cybart said. Apple operates 506 stores on five continents, about a 25 percent increase since Ms. Ahrendts was hired. Mr. Cybart said Apple had recently increased its focus on adding stores in prominent locations in major cities like Chicago and Milan. Two Wedbush Securities analysts, Daniel Ives and Strecker Backe, said in a research note that one of Ms. O'Brien's focuses would be stimulating demand in China, where the retail experience is important. They said they were encouraged that Apple had chosen Ms. O'Brien over an outside hire, given the company's recent struggles. ""While the timing of this departure is a head scratcher, change could be a good thing for Apple, as the last year has been nothing to write home about,"" they wrote.","Angela Ahrendts, hired after leading Burberry to global prominence, was among Apple's highest-paid executives.",71f3404d-693e-5094-9bed-c439f89b3daa,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/05/business/06apple/merlin_107963495_c0f0e5dd-0181-4a2a-ad8b-11b187615515-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=0d7d314bb2cad1fa3578b43052a14555eaef7b375bbbc90d6d7f22d1207be265&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Angela Ahrendts, formerly the chief executive of Burberry, said Tuesday that she would step down as Apple's retail chief in April.",71f3404d-693e-5094-9bed-c439f89b3daa,N24News/imgs/71f3404d-693e-5094-9bed-c439f89b3daa.jpg,20
Sports,"Despite Trump's Optimism, Lack of Sports Could Extend Into the Fall",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/sports/trump-sports-return-coronavirus.html,"Although President Trump has expressed optimism that sports leagues could resume play ""sooner than later,"" sports leaders have been planning for a longer postponement of games and events, extending into the fall and possibly later. After meeting with the commissioners of several major sports leagues on Saturday, Mr. Trump discussed resuming sports in August, ESPN reported, though Mr. Trump later told reporters at the White House, ""I can't tell you a date, but I think it's going to be sooner rather than later."" ""I want fans back in the arenas,"" he said at the White House, adding, ""As soon as we can, obviously.'' Still, a range of sports leaders and public officials have cast doubt on normalcy returning anytime soon, and even fall events face uncertainty over concerns that a renewal of mass gatherings could undermine any gains made in the fight against the pandemic by then.

The N.F.L., which is scheduled to conduct its annual draft from April 23 to 25 by videoconference, has said it is focused on not altering the regular season, which is scheduled to begin on Sept. 10. But some team owners say there is a good chance the international games in London and Mexico City will be moved back to the United States, and one owner raised the possibility that the season could be reduced from 16 games to as few as 10. An N.F.L. spokesman, Brian McCarthy, said the league's decisions will be ""guided by the latest advice from medical and public health officials, as well as current and future government regulations."" The N.F.L.'s chief medical officer, Dr. Allen Sills, was more definitive. ""As long as we're still in a place where when a single individual tests positive for the virus that you have to quarantine every single person who was in contact with them in any shape, form or fashion, then I don't think you can begin to think about reopening a team sport,"" Sills told NFL.com last week. ""Because we're going to have positive cases for a very long time.""

The N.B.A. and N.H.L., which were deep into their 2019-20 seasons before they were suspended last month, may be unable to finish their seasons because the cities they play in have restrictions on nonessential travel and because of the difficulty of acquiring enough test kits to ensure the safety of the players, team staffs and workers in arenas. Mike Bass, a spokesman for the N.B.A., which would have started its postseason on April 18, said, ""Any decision on a date to restart the season is likely weeks away and will be made in consultation with public health experts and in line with governmental directives and guidance.""

Major League Soccer, which had started its regular season, and Major League Baseball, which had its spring training interrupted, are looking at truncated schedules. Both leagues have also contemplated playing games in empty stadiums, though it is unclear how risky that might be to players and to employees who produce the games. Officials in both leagues said they prefer to play with fans in the seats.
* None
* Week 11 Predictions: Here are our picks against the spread.
* N.F.L. Tightens Covid Protocols: As cases rise and Thanksgiving approaches, the league is requiring masks inside team facilities and increasing testing.
* The Packers' Defense Is Their M.V.P.: Green Bay's oft-overlooked defense has kept the team from falling out of the Super Bowl chase.
* The Long Path to the Super Bowl: With 18 weeks in the regular season and fewer teams earning byes in the playoffs, the Super Bowl is still a long way off.
* Playoff Simulator: Explore every team's path to the postseason, updated live. Either way, sports leagues and tournaments say they will let the advice of medical experts, not the president, guide their decisions on when to resume play. ""I hope so,"" Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, said Monday when asked about Trump's ""sooner rather than later"" forecast. ""But I won't do anything that doesn't put the safety of our employees and customers first. Nothing is more important than their health."" Indeed, the governors of two of the country's largest states -- California and New York, which together host more than 20 teams in the five largest leagues -- said they were skeptical of the president's timeline. ""I'm not anticipating that happening in this state,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said Saturday after the president spoke. ""One has to be very cautious here, one has to be careful not to over promise."" Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York said he, too, will rely on guidance from medical experts. ""I would love to see sports back, help with cabin fever,"" he said on Sunday. ""But this is not about hopes and dreams and aspirations and what you would like to see. None of us like being here. Follow the data, follow the science, let the professional doctors, health care professionals tell you when it's safe to reopen and that's when you reopen.""

Epidemiologists have warned that even when the number of new cases starts to fall, travel barriers and curbs on gatherings in many places could persist until a vaccine or a treatment is found. The risk otherwise is a resurgence, given the prevalence of asymptomatic people who might unknowingly carry the virus. Amid the uncertainty about when it will be safe to resume play, leagues and tournaments continue to come up with contingencies. The N.F.L. could delay the start of training camp and eliminate some or all of its preseason games and bye weeks to hold the Super Bowl, as scheduled, on Feb. 7, 2021, one N.F.L. owner said. In college sports, the Pac-12 Conference will be guided by two factors: what public health and state officials say and what activities are allowed on campuses, a conference official said. For example, if students are not sitting in classrooms, players will not be sitting in meeting rooms. Penn State athletic director Sandy Barbour told reporters in a conference call last week that she thought if players could safely return 60 days before the first game -- essentially by around July 1 -- then the season could proceed as scheduled. An N.C.A.A. spokesman declined to respond to Mr. Trump's assertion that sports were likely to return this summer. The N.B.A. has explored bringing all the teams to Las Vegas to play games without fans, akin to the G League Showcase it stages there every December or its Summer League model. But there are doubts about how the league could oversee a safe and effective quarantine for the players, coaches and the dozens, and perhaps hundreds, of other people needed to operate the games. The players would also need at least a month to get into playing shape after such a sudden and long layoff. Josh Hart of the New Orleans Pelicans said it was ""just too hard"" for the N.B.A. to resume operations ""any time in the next two, three, four months.""

Even without fans, the league would have to find enough coronavirus tests for the players, coaches, trainers, support staff, television production crews and other personnel. The league would need the approval of the players' union if it chooses to play in empty stadiums. The league has no plans to cancel big chunks of the season. Rather, it would cancel small pieces as it goes along. The league is also considering playing at neutral sites for regular season and postseason games.","Public officials and sports leaders, worried events could wipe out gains made in the pandemic, are examining shortened seasons or not having them at all.",4f21d537-02ac-5785-887a-2248268f0d93,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/06/sports/06virus-sports-1/06virus-sports-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=b037c532e7a996da0bff9ff35e5d16eed5432aafe891634a8b4a1d4fba024848&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""I want fans back in the arenas,"" President Trump said on Saturday at the White House, adding, ""As soon as we can, obviously.''",4f21d537-02ac-5785-887a-2248268f0d93,N24News/imgs/4f21d537-02ac-5785-887a-2248268f0d93.jpg,9
Real Estate,Who's Calling It a Dog's Life?,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/realestate/buildings-rolling-out-dog-day-care.html,"THERE was a time when the New York City real estate world generally shunned owners of those furry creatures that chase cars and trucks, but times have changed. Now, the city's landlords and property developers are doing their own chasing -- after dogs and, in particular, their well-heeled owners. As residential towers work to incorporate puppy playgrounds and doggy doors into their amenities, the apartment management company Rose Associates has taken attentiveness to a new level, offering dog-care services en masse to thousands of residents. The services, provided by a dog-care group called the Spot Experience, will be offered first at the Aldyn and the Ashley on the Upper West Side beginning on Aug. 1. The next buildings scheduled to roll out the new offering will be the Verdesian, the Visionaire and the Solaire in Battery Park City, and by the end of October, Rose plans to expand it to 20 of its dog-friendly buildings, said Jamie Kaufman, the manager of Rose's concierge program. Later in the year, Rose will extend the amenity at a rate of about three to four buildings a month, she said. The management company has more than 56 dog-friendly buildings serving thousands of residents.

The Spot Experience -- with four Manhattan locations that offer dog day care, training, grooming, walking and retail pet services -- will operate a dedicated shuttle service to transport residents' dogs to and from day care. At Spot facilities, on the Upper West Side and in TriBeCa and Chelsea, dogs can be groomed or trained or simply lounge about. Residents of buildings working with Spot will have membership fees waived and receive discounts and priority access to services that might get booked up quickly, said Mitch Marrow, the founder and chief executive of the Spot Experience. For five- or seven-day-a-week day care, residents would pay $26 to $28 a day, he said. ""Compared to what you pay for a dog-walker in the city,"" Mr. Marrow said, ""if you had to have a minimum of two walks while you were gone from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., it's a discount."" The doggy day care amenity eliminates the need for multiple dog-walkers to wander throughout buildings, Ms. Kaufman said. ""We wanted to make sure our buildings are secure,"" she said, ""so it's not some random dog-walker bringing 10 dogs into the building and having them on every floor."" The dog-care services also will give Rose a marketing edge when it comes to leasing apartments, Ms. Kaufman said. Rose will offer dog owners information packets on the services, along with chew toys and dog treats, and those who don't own dogs will get information titled ""Thinking of Getting a Dog?""

Already, at the Aldyn and the Ashley, Spot Experience residents have been asking about certain dog breeds, Mr. Marrow said.""They want to get a puppy now, because having these services makes it easy for them to have it. We can housebreak it for them; we can do the basic training; we can do all the tough stuff, and they can have their pup to play with."" Mr. Marrow, a former hedge-fund employee who says he wants his dog-care company to compare to any other high-end amenity provider, describes Manhattan's dog owners as underserved.""Almost 70 percent of New Yorkers who live in residential buildings with an income of over $150,000 own a dog,"" he said, ""so that's a pretty big number."" As an Upper West Side resident with a St. Bernard and a bull mastiff, Mr. Marrow said he struggled to find a company to provide the right care for his dogs, and would often run home from work to feed and walk them. ""I couldn't get my head around why there wasn't just somebody that came in and really did it right,"" he said, ""because there's obviously such a need."" The next step for Spot is to work with property developers to create Spot facilities within or near a residential building, specifically for that building's residents, Mr. Marrow said. Ms. Kaufman said Rose was considering such facilities for some of its buildings. Bob Cohen, a resident of the Park Millennium in the Lincoln Center area, urged his condo board to consider the Spot Experience as an amenity. Mr. Cohen, the owner of a golden doodle named Spike, had been disappointed with a previous dog-care company. He described his first visit to a Spot facility as ""kind of Zen atmosphere,"" adding, ""The dogs just hanging out, and everyone was just kind of grooving."" Since January the Park Millennium has had a partnership with Spot, and about 30 of its condo owners use the service regularly. Spot has cameras in its facilities, enabling owners to log onto its Web site at any time to check up on their dogs, but Mr. Cohen said he trusted that Spike was getting good care. ""I walk him there sometimes,"" he said, ""and when he sees the storefront, he starts pulling to get inside. He's got friends there.""",A property management company will be offering dog-care services to thousands of apartment residents.,8fb27de5-ba19-54fc-8877-9280cc191178,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/07/15/realestate/15POSTING_SPAN/15POSTING_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2012&h=350&w=600&s=a40c76b5de213cf00d502bd9203fd88e6dffb87792c9a7afdf36d77dd252dca7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"YOU WALK, I WAG Jesse Baron of Spot Experience takes Lucky for a walk near the Aldyn.

Sports,Patriots Draft Kicker With Tattoo of a Militia Group,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/26/sports/football/patriots-kicker-tattoo-Rohrwasser.html,"N.F.L. teams are sometimes criticized for drafting kickers, particularly if they take them as early as the fifth round.

That did not deter the New England Patriots from selecting Justin Rohrwasser, a kicker from Marshall, on Saturday with one of their two fifth-round picks.

The choice was controversial for another reason: Rohrwasser has a tattoo on his arm with the logo for the Three Percenters, a far-right militia group. The logo, which includes the Roman numeral III surrounded by 13 stars in a circle, has become popular among antigovernment extremists. Rohrwasser also has a tattoo of an American flag on his right arm, and other tattoos that say ""Liberty or Death"" and ""Don't Tread on Me.""

The Three Percenters were formed after President Barack Obama took office in 2009, and, according to the Anti-Defamation League, ""view themselves as modern day versions"" of the colonists who fought the British during the Revolutionary War and are now devoted to fighting what they view as a ""tyrannical U.S. government."" Members of the group were among those in Washington State protesting measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.","The kicker, Justin Rohrwasser, out of Marshall University, said that he did not support the far-right group, the Three Percenters, and also that he would cover the tattoo.",578163b5-a83f-528e-b8ee-9ab5d8222585,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/27/sports/27NFL-patskicker-1/27NFL-patskicker-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=95e897bccdfb827b37587489fcbe4499c848cf8468ec5fd1f8188abb8f1228b6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Justin Rohrwasser, right, was congratulated by Marshall quarterback Isaiah Green after Rohrwasser kicked a game-winning field goal against Western Kentucky in October.",578163b5-a83f-528e-b8ee-9ab5d8222585,N24News/imgs/578163b5-a83f-528e-b8ee-9ab5d8222585.jpg,9
Opinion,Trump Says He 'Aced' a Cognition Test. What Does That Tell Us?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/11/opinion/trump-cognitive-test.html,"Next, here's a piece of paper. Write a simple sentence. It must have a subject and verb and make sense, like ""Hey, this is not a very difficult exam to pass."" (The maximum score for this test is 30; a score below 20 usually indicates cognitive impairment.)

You get the idea. These cognitive tests are basic and, unless you have dementia or some other medical or psychiatric problem that would impair your cognition, you, too, will likely ""ace"" any of these tests. If Mr. Trump wants to impress the public with his cognitive prowess, perhaps he should take the SAT.

I doubt that Mr. Trump will see it this way, but by bragging about his cognitive abilities, he's asking us to consider what to expect, cognitively, of older people -- and what cognitive attributes matter most in a president. After all, he and his likely challenger, former Vice President Joseph Biden, are well into their 70s, and their cognitive function is unlikely to be what it was in their 20s. And for a very good reason.

Just like the heart, kidneys and muscles, the brain ages and typically loses some function, something that scientists refer to as normal cognitive aging. Which is to say that you are not as mentally fast or agile at 75 as you were at 20. Your short-term memory is also probably not the same. And, at 70, you are probably not going to outperform your 17-year-old self on the SAT -- or any test that requires fast reasoning. Not that you care, since you aren't applying to college.

Yet, if you peer inside the brain -- it's easy to examine neurons under a microscope in a post-mortem exam -- you will find that with age people don't lose too many neurons in the prefrontal cortex, the brain's executive control center and reasoner-in-chief.","If the president wants to impress us with his intellect, he should take the SAT.",34f51653-d241-5e79-a6bc-13c24bfe0142,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/11/opinion/11friedman1/11friedman1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=ebc507bf10597d51834e726f02d4bfef4baa34e238da5d04c18ec9acfe4838bd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"President Trump in Doral, Fla., on Friday.",34f51653-d241-5e79-a6bc-13c24bfe0142,N24News/imgs/34f51653-d241-5e79-a6bc-13c24bfe0142.jpg,11
Sports,"Bubba Wallace Thankful for Flag Ban, but NASCAR's Fans Might Not Be",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/13/sports/bubba-wallace-nascar-confederate-flag.html,"Now that Darrell Wallace Jr., the sole African-American driver in NASCAR's top racing series, has persuaded the organization to bar the Confederate flag from its events, he expects his life to be a little different. A text from his father reminded him of that. ""He was proud of what I was doing on and off the racetrack, but he was worried about safety, going out in public and whatnot,"" Wallace, who is known as Bubba, said Friday during a teleconference with reporters. ""It's just crazy you have to worry about that side of things. Definitely got to watch your back now."" Wallace, 26, received praise and support from other top drivers for making the ban happen amid wider protests about racial injustice in the United States and the rest of the world, prompted by the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. But some NASCAR fans are furious at Wallace because they view the Confederate flag as being part of their Southern heritage -- not as a symbol of racism -- and thus an integral part of the sport, which has deep Southern roots.

""To you, it might seem like heritage, but others see hate,"" he said. ""We need to come together and meet in the middle and say, 'You know what, if this bothers you, I don't mind taking it down.'"" There once was a time that a person could not walk 20 paces at a NASCAR race without seeing a Confederate flag. Fans would come to the races with Confederate flag images on their clothing. Flags would also dot the racetrack's infield, because spectators would raise them high above their motor homes that they parked there for a weekend-long party. Long ago, the rebel flag was even a part of the victory celebration. At Darlington Raceway in South Carolina, a character named Johnny Reb, created in the 1960s, dressed in a Confederate soldier's gray uniform and would ride on the hood of the winning car to victory lane while waving the Confederate flag. While the more showy celebrations of the flag have disappeared over the years, many fans still flew it during races. They even flew the flag in 2015, after NASCAR officially discouraged them from doing so, in the aftermath of the murder of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., by the white supremacist Dylann Roof.

NASCAR tiptoed its way around the issue, offering fans at its races American flags in exchange for their Confederate ones. Few fans took them up on the offer, and NASCAR continued struggling to balance a new demographic of fans beyond the white and conservative Southern ones that helped NASCAR grow into a powerhouse industry in the early to mid-2000s. Since then, NASCAR has traveled far from its roots, which were planted in dirt tracks in places like Rockingham, N.C., and Talladega, Ala., by drivers who honed their skills by running moonshine and outrunning revenuers. The races once were predominantly in the Southeast, and its drivers hailed from the region. Now, NASCAR races are held on tracks from coast to coast, and only two of the top 10 drivers are from the Southeast. Kyle Petty, the longtime racer and son of the seven-time NASCAR champion Richard Petty, called the ban ""a huge moment."" ""As we look at the sport and how the sport has grown, we were way behind the curve,"" he said on the show ""NASCAR America"" on NBCSN. And NASCAR's recent efforts to grow, while also trying to make the sport more inclusive, have not been successful: The number of fans who have abandoned the sport since its peak is startling. For example, this year's Daytona 500, NASCAR's marquee race, had 7.3 million television viewers. Just five years ago, in 2015, that number was nearly double, at 13.4 million. The organization also has made efforts to diversify, with programs aimed at hiring minority drivers. Yet when Wallace won a race in 2013 at one of NASCAR's national series, it was the first time an African-American had won at that level in 50 years. Matthew Bernthal, the marketing department chair at Florida Southern College, has studied NASCAR, and said the organization has grappled with the flag issue for a while. ""I simply don't think they had a choice right now but to ban the flag, given the mood of the country,"" he said. ""But I think the brand's values have shifted because they have chosen to take such a strong stance.""

With the coronavirus public health crisis limiting fans at racetracks, it might be a long while before NASCAR feels the full impact of its decision. But Darrell Waltrip, the three-time Winston Cup series champion who retired in 2000, warned people not to view complaints about the ban on social media as an indication that fans will leave the sport. ""Look, how many people said they were going to move to Canada when Trump won the election, and how many of them really did?"" he said. ""Everybody makes idle threats but very few people that I know follow through."" Wallace realizes that his speaking out has already deeply affected the sport and the way it is perceived. He called for NASCAR to ban the flag on Monday. On Wednesday, it happened. That night, he raced at Martinsville Speedway in Virginia, and said it was the biggest race of his career. He felt the country watching. To commemorate the moment, Wallace unveiled a different paint scheme for his No. 43 Chevrolet, with a Black Lives Matter logo emblazoned on its sides and the words ""Compassion, Love, Understanding"" written on its hood. When he stood on pit road for the national anthem, for the second race in a row, Wallace wore a black T-shirt displaying the words, ""I Can't Breathe. Black Lives Matter."" An avalanche of fans tuned in to see him, some commenting on social media that it was their first NASCAR race. LeBron James tweeted a message to Wallace before the race. Wallace replied: ""Let's get it homie. Appreciate you. Respect."" Wallace said on Friday that he hadn't given much thought to kneeling during the national anthem, a demonstration that Colin Kaepernick and other players used in the N.F.L. that also garnered passionate reaction from fans. Wallace said he is studying and learning about exactly what message ""we are trying to push across, learn, and understand."" ""I think the messages that I have been putting out there on the racetrack and during the anthem is speaking for itself,"" he said.","Some NASCAR fans are furious at Wallace because they view the Confederate flag as being part of their Southern heritage, not as a symbol of racism.",1726df68-986f-54d7-bf43-fe48bfc7e125,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/13/sports/11unrest-nascar-flag-print/11unrest-nascar-flag-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=d9f36e6c97f255b35474a136a09db2683cb2ae47c631737df9faa0f943d4af5c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A race in Talladega, Ala., in 2007.

Dance,'La Sylphide' Is Taking Flight at New York City Ballet,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/arts/dance/la-sylphide-is-taking-flight-at-new-york-city-ballet.html,"""Yesssss!"" Peter Martins yelled with relish, as he pulled a scarf out of a caldron and brandished it overhead. ""Wipe the floor with him!"" Mr. Martins was enthusiastically demonstrating a moment in his new production of ""La Sylphide,"" when the witch Madge gives a poisoned scarf to the hero James. Two dancers, watching nearby, laughed. ""He is so enjoying this,"" one said to the other. Members of New York City Ballet, which will present the premiere of ""La Sylphide,"" together with ""Bournonville Divertissements,"" at the company's spring gala on Thursday, were onstage in late February at the David H. Koch Theater, enjoying the unusual luxury of an orchestra and costume rehearsal three months before opening night. And Mr. Martins, the company's ballet master in chief, was making the most of the opportunity to show the dancers just how clearly the ballet's extensive mime passages and varieties of dance tone had to read to the audience. ""La Sylphide,"" created in 1836 by the Danish choreographer August Bournonville (who took the idea from an 1832 version by Filippo Taglioni), is set to music by Herman Lovenskjold, and offers the tale of a young Scottish farmer, James, who jilts his fiancee, Effie, on their wedding day after becoming entranced by an ethereal woodland sprite. (""Sylphide"" comes from ""silva,"" Latin for forest.) The ballet is the oldest of the 19th-century works still commonly performed all over the world. And it's the one that established the Romantic idea of the ballerina as a luminously unattainable object of desire, partly through its extensive use of pointe work -- a relatively newfangled idea -- to create an effect of lightness and flight.

It isn't exactly an obvious choice for City Ballet, home to the great modernist oeuvre of George Balanchine, and harbinger of the balletically new. But ""La Sylphide"" is a deep part of the dance heritage of Mr. Martins, who was born in Copenhagen, trained at the Royal Danish Ballet School and danced with the Royal Danish Ballet. He first performed in a child's role in the ballet when he was 8, then danced corps de ballet parts when he entered the company. Later, when already a star in New York, he returned to the Danish company as a guest to dance James. ""I brought it to City Ballet because there is a history of Bournonville and Danish teaching and dancing here, and I wanted it to be part of the dancers' educational process,"" Mr. Martins said in an interview in his office at the theater. ""It was Balanchine who went to Stanley Williams, who had been my teacher at the Royal Danish Ballet School, and said please put together 'Bournonville Divertissments,' an audience should know this work. Stanley did it, and Balanchine never missed a performance. He once said to me, 'Bournonville entertained with steps, like Petipa.' No psychology, just the steps."" Mr. Martins has staged ""La Sylphide"" before; he set it on the Pennsylvania Ballet in 1985, and has kept the designs from that production, by Susan Tammany, for the City Ballet version. In both instances, he did not change the Bournonville choreography. ""It is too good to tamper with,"" he said. To help master Bournonville style, which emphasizes fleet footwork, a bouncy jump and an almost static torso with arms held low, Mr. Martins invited Petrusjka Broholm, a former Royal Danish Ballet dancer and teacher, to coach the dancers.

""It's a different coordination to what they are used to here,"" Ms. Broholm said in a break during the rehearsal. ""There is a lot going on with the feet, nothing on top, and the musicality is very different. Balanchine uses the downbeat to go up, Bournonville is the opposite. It's like changing the way you walk. Not easy, but the dancers here can adapt to anything."" That adaptation was tough, said Sterling Hyltin, who is dancing the title character, with Joaquin De Luz as James, on opening night. ""The big difference is that you can't use your arms to jump up, only when you are landing,"" she said. ""It gives an incredibly light look, but for the first weeks, I felt like I had the flu because my legs hurt so badly."" The ballet's extensive mime sequences presented even more of a challenge than the Bournonville technique, Mr. Martins said. ""It's the key to getting the ballet across,"" he said. ""In Denmark, we had mime classes from 12 years old; I know that mime, it is in me. These dancers are not trained in that way. The art of mime is very important to me, and I am determined to get them to convey what they are actually saying. It can't look like sign language, it must resonate. So I tell them you have to say it out loud while practicing it."" The character that drives the ""Sylphide"" story is the witch Madge. (The role is often played by a man; the great Danish dancer Erik Bruhn was both a famous James and a famous Madge.) Insulted by James early on in the ballet -- ""he knows instinctively she is evil,"" Mikhail Baryshnikov wrote in an interesting account of the ballet. After James winds the scarf around the Sylphide, she dies in his arms. Utterly bereft, he sees Effie go by in a marriage procession with his friend Gurn. Georgina Pazcoguin, who plays Madge, said she had been amazed by the level of detail written into the role. ""Just turning your palm one way or another can make the meaning of a gesture completely different,"" she said. ""I don't know how it will translate to our audience who aren't used to mime, but Peter has been really emphatic about it all."" She added: ""I think he secretly really wants to do Madge."" Mr. Martins laughed when that was put to him. ""Madge became a vehicle for stars, and I don't want to go there,"" he said. In any case, his approach to dancing Bournonville had never been an orthodox one. ""I allow them to dance the way they dance and not be confined to an image of the past,"" he said. ""As much as 'Sylphide' is historic, it cannot be approached like a lithograph or an old photo. It doesn't mean you can't approximate a stylistic accuracy, but you don't have to be a slave. It has to move the way we dance now.""","The ballet established the idea of the ballerina as a luminously unattainable object of desire, partly through its extensive use of pointe work.",602de847-1545-5af6-9f94-48a8e9dd0311,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/03/arts/03SYLPHIDE1/03SYLPHIDE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=bb11b1fad4ee09b21c318dd0252d4519c7fab30b9441bbc0dab0bc4b65ace43e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Peter Martins, New York City Ballet's master in chief is preparing to present ""La Sylphide,"" featuring Sterling Hyltin and Joaquin De Luz, together top in rehearsal.",602de847-1545-5af6-9f94-48a8e9dd0311,N24News/imgs/602de847-1545-5af6-9f94-48a8e9dd0311.jpg,6
Music,"The Met Opera Fired James Levine, Citing Sexual Misconduct. He Was Paid $3.5 Million.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/20/arts/music/met-opera-james-levine.html,"Last summer, Peter Gelb, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, convened the executive committee of the company's board to announce the end of one of the highest-profile, messiest feuds in the Met's nearly 140-year history. A bitter court battle had concluded between the company and the conductor James Levine, who had shaped the Met's artistic identity for more than four decades before his career was engulfed by allegations of sexual improprieties. Mr. Gelb told the committee that the resolution was advantageous to the Met. But the settlement, whose terms have not been publicly disclosed until now, called for the company and its insurer to pay Mr. Levine $3.5 million, according to two people familiar with its terms. The Met had fired Mr. Levine in 2018 after an internal investigation uncovered what the company called credible evidence of ""sexually abusive and harassing conduct toward vulnerable artists in the early stages of their careers."" Rather than going quietly, Mr. Levine sued the company for breach of contract and defamation, seeking at least $5.8 million. The Met countersued, revealing lurid details of its investigation and claiming that Mr. Levine's misconduct had violated his duties. It sought roughly the same amount. A year later, and after millions of dollars in legal fees on both sides, the company agreed to pay Mr. Levine, though millions less than he had sought. The terms of the settlement have not previously been disclosed because a confidentiality agreement has kept both parties from revealing its details.

The Met's multimillion-dollar payment to Mr. Levine came before the coronavirus pandemic forced the company to close its theater -- leaving many employees, including its orchestra and chorus, furloughed without pay since April. Even when the deal was struck, the Met's finances were precarious. Now the company is fighting for its survival. The size of the payment to Mr. Levine, whom the Met had accused of serious misconduct, casts doubt on the strength of the company's case had it gone to trial. Mr. Levine's contract, which had been amended over the years but was essentially based on agreements struck decades ago, lacked a morals clause, an increasingly common feature in the entertainment world that prohibits behavior with the potential to embarrass an employer. It has not been uncommon for high-profile figures forced from their jobs after accusations of sexual misconduct or harassment to leave with big payouts, often to satisfy the terms of their contracts. Two of Fox News's most prominent personalities received large payments after they were forced out amid allegations of harassment: Roger Ailes, the network's former chairman, got about $40 million when he left, and Bill O'Reilly, one of Fox's biggest stars, received roughly $25 million. But it is rare for someone who leaves under pressure because of sexual misconduct allegations to publicly challenge the firing in court. In his suit, Mr. Levine had sought $3.4 million for breach of contract after the Met stopped paying his $400,000-a-year salary as music director emeritus, just a year and a half into a 10-year agreement. He also sought more than $1.6 million for the remaining performances he had expected to conduct during the season he was fired and the season following, as well as $707,500 for defamation; he argued that the Met's statements about him led other orchestras to fire him and cost him a book project. And he sought other, unspecified amounts for defamation, pain and suffering, and attorney's fees. Before the Met's investigation and Mr. Levine's firing, it appeared that Mr. Gelb had succeeded in easing the revered but ailing maestro into a dignified career coda, making way for Mr. Levine, now 77, to be succeeded by the young and dynamic Yannick Nezet-Seguin. After ill health forced Mr. Levine to repeatedly cancel performances and miss two full seasons, he had reluctantly agreed to become music director emeritus. He would continue to oversee the young artist program he had founded and to conduct many of his signature operas, with a gala celebration of the 50th anniversary of his 1971 Met debut on the horizon.

Mr. Levine's continued role came at considerable cost to the company. In addition to his $400,000 salary, the Met agreed to pay him his customary $27,000 fee for each performance he conducted -- $10,000 more than what the Met usually described in public as its top fee. That arrangement came to an abrupt end in December 2017, after The New York Times published the accounts of four men who said that they had been sexually abused by Mr. Levine as teenagers; Mr. Levine denied the accusations. Coming at the height of the #MeToo movement, the accounts caused a furor, and the Met suspended Mr. Levine without pay and began an investigation. Other orchestras and festivals immediately cut their ties with him, including the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Ravinia Festival outside Chicago, where he had longstanding relationships. After a three-month investigation, in which its lawyers interviewed over 70 people, the Met fired Mr. Levine in March 2018, saying the investigation had uncovered additional troubling incidents and that it would be ""inappropriate and impossible"" for Mr. Levine to continue at the Met in any capacity. The company resisted paying Mr. Levine severance, or any money owed under his existing contract. Although Mr. Levine's lawsuit included defamation claims -- all but one of which were later dismissed -- it was essentially a breach of contract suit. With no morals clause, about the only basis for ending the agreement, apart from rare acts of god that would prevent the Met from functioning, was Mr. Levine's death or disability. But, armed with the findings of its investigation, the Met countersued. It cited seven unnamed people who had been the victims of what it called ""sexually abusive and harassing conduct."" Mr. Levine was undeterred by the potentially embarrassing public disclosures. People familiar with his thinking said the conductor, who has never publicly discussed his sexuality, felt he could rebut the allegations. And he was already so humiliated that he felt he had nothing further to lose by litigating.

The Met did not name any of the seven accusers. But one of the men in the Met's court filing was identified by Mr. Levine's lawyers as Ashok Pai, whose account of being molested by Mr. Levine as a teenager figured prominently in articles in The Times and The New York Post. Another accuser was a longtime Met employee who, the Met said, Mr. Levine had propositioned while wearing a bathrobe and had subsequently ""inappropriately touched"" at least seven times between 1979 -- when the man was 16 and auditioning for Mr. Levine -- and 1991. In a third incident, from 1985, the Met said Mr. Levine had driven an opera singer home from an audition, then locked him in the car and groped and kissed him against his will, later placing him in ""a prestigious program"" at the company. In another incident reported by the Met, Mr. Levine asked an artist if he ""had a large penis."" Mr. Levine's lawyers denied all the allegations, and were eager to question witnesses under oath, and to ask the Met's leaders about other sexual improprieties at the company over the years and the degree to which they had been tolerated. The Met's lawyers zeroed in on another sensitive area for Mr. Levine, demanding his medical records. Just as depositions were about to begin in earnest, the parties agreed to submit the case to mediation. Even then, tensions ran high as Mr. Gelb and Mr. Levine faced one another at the opening session, according to two people familiar with the proceedings. An exasperated Mr. Levine even left the session before being persuaded to sign off on the $3.5 million agreement. The resolution was announced publicly on Aug. 6, 2019, just days after the end of the Met's fiscal year. As a tax-exempt nonprofit institution, the Met files annual disclosure statements that include revenues and expenses, as well as specific large payments to independent contractors, such as Mr. Levine. But filings for the period in which the Met paid Mr. Levine are not due until mid-2021.",The terms of the settlement between the renowned conductor and the company he shaped have not been previously disclosed.,e0ec3099-bf89-5cc3-8011-e0834762e504,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/20/arts/20levine/20levine-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=18963fc7ae70f5aaae32d9ddc9d7240c9ce88c4cfb4816dd13a6ae9701fba16a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,James Levine shaped the Metropolitan Opera for more than four decades before his career was engulfed by allegations of sexual improprieties.,e0ec3099-bf89-5cc3-8011-e0834762e504,N24News/imgs/e0ec3099-bf89-5cc3-8011-e0834762e504.jpg,12
Music,Dying Languages Cry Out in 'Last Whispers',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/arts/music/last-whispers-lena-herzog.html,"Lena Herzog in a preserved cedar grove in Los Angeles. She calls her work ""Last Whispers"" ""an oratorio for vanishing voices, collapsing universes and a falling tree.""



MONTCLAIR, N.J. -- The earth spins onscreen amid an eerie, uncomfortable sound, like a building rush of air. It's an ominous, galactic vision that swiftly condenses into an intimate one: A dot of flickering light in the middle of darkness; a woman's voice singing, her fragile intakes of breath audible; an electric guitar strumming with spare, melancholy sweetness. Her words are unfamiliar, a little guttural, the consonants chewy. A title tells us that the woman is singing in Ingrian, a nearly extinct Finnic language spoken now by just a handful of people in western Russia. It is one of over three dozen endangered languages heard in ""Last Whispers,"" a film and surround-sound experience that will be screened Oct. 16-20 at Peak Performances at Montclair State University. Its creator, the artist Lena Herzog, calls it ""an oratorio for vanishing voices, collapsing universes and a falling tree"" -- as good a classification as any for an unclassifiable work.

So reverberant chant in Bathari, a language spoken by perhaps a few dozen people in Oman, sounds alongside enigmatic footage of rock formations. A blurry figure walks in the distance, eventually covered by pages and pages of scrolling script, as we listen to the evocative Ahom language of India. A child speaks Light Warlpiri, which has a few hundred native speakers in northern Australia. That we don't see the speakers and can't know what's being said is the point of this austere and poignant Babel. The musical landscape is sometimes gentle, sometimes aggressive, but it always keeps our attention on the rich, incomprehensible, often overlapping chorus of words. The camera slowly approaches ghostly forests, bodies of water and, through space, our planet -- imagery that suggests the language crisis interacts with, and is in part caused by, even graver threats to earth's sustainability. Ms. Herzog dates the origins of ""Last Whispers"" to more than 15 years ago, and her interest in languages even further -- back to when, as a young girl growing up in Russia, she struggled to learn English to understand a Sherlock Holmes story that turned on the deciphering of a code presented as dancing stick figures.

""The more you learn about languages,"" she said in a telephone interview, ""the more you learn they're all vanishing. What was confounding to me was how little we know about that extinction. And we are losing languages at a more rapid pace."" A photographer, she years ago found herself in the habit of listening to archival language recordings while printing in her darkroom. At first, she envisioned creating a gallery full of portraits of last speakers of these languages, with recordings emanating from behind the prints. ""But we separate ourselves from them because they're in portrait, they're the other,"" she said. ""I wanted us to feel enmeshed in them: They're us."" The more literal, visual aspect of the portraits began to disappear, but the notion of immersive sound remained. (The artist and anthropologist Susan Hiller has also made work about vanishing tongues that focuses on sound.) Poring through endless audio files of endangered languages being spoken, Ms. Herzog began a largely intuitive selection process.

""I would mark the ones to which I responded,"" she said. ""I couldn't articulate it in words. I knew how I wanted it to feel. I wanted it to be haunting, to be able to get into your cerebellum. I would go through hours listening to these voices talking, chanting, whispering, confessing.""

Since she lacked a background in music or sound engineering, Ms. Herzog cast around for a composer-designer who could help her organize this sprawling archive of voices. Eventually she settled on a pair: Marco Capalbo, a composer and director, and Mark Mangini, an Academy Award-winning sound designer (""Mad Max: Fury Road""), who each contributed sections of the finished piece. Their styles ended up being complementary: Mr. Mangini treats the voices with a lyrical, Romantic touch -- a ""21st-century version of Rachmaninoff,"" as Ms. Herzog put it -- while Mr. Capalbo's landscape is tougher and more aggressive, laced with the sound, translated into audible frequencies, of collapsing stars. Some early ideas were a bit outlandish: At one point, Ms. Herzog intended to pump the sound mix through the root systems of trees, for an effect that would be audible by listening closely to the trunks. (""No park would let us,"" Mr. Mangini said dryly.) Then there was a notion of mounting speakers high up in a forest grove.",Lena Herzog's mixture of enigmatic film and immersive sound evokes a global crisis of linguistic disappearance.,8f24ba9a-e379-50f1-be77-58b590909ada,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/11/arts/11lastwhispers3/11lastwhispers3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=f280846a71090877351bc2a05e3ab46ab6e4cddf1d40fb2852b2a8bb18d06e11&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""The form this extinction takes is silence,"" Ms. Herzog said.",8f24ba9a-e379-50f1-be77-58b590909ada,N24News/imgs/8f24ba9a-e379-50f1-be77-58b590909ada.jpg,12
Dance,Sylvie Guillem Prepares to End Her Ballet Career,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/08/arts/dance/sylvie-guillem-prepares-to-end-her-ballet-career.html,"MILAN -- ""I am not nice,"" the ballerina Sylvie Guillem said. Seated in her dressing room in the Teatro Arcimboldi here, Ms. Guillem burst out laughing. ""That has gotten me into a lot of trouble."" Nice or not, the French-born Ms. Guillem -- tall, skinny, pale, jaggedly cropped red hair -- is good company and one of the most famous dancers in the world. Like Rudolf Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov, her renown extends well beyond the ballet world. Since she burst on to the international scene in the late 1980s, her extraordinarily long, lean and flexible physicality has redefined expectations about the female aesthetic and technical prowess in ballet. And like Nureyev and Mr. Baryshnikov -- but even more unusually as a woman -- she has had a self-determined career, one that has helped forge a path for a generation of world-class dancers seeking similar independence. Now that career -- an extraordinarily long one by dancer standards -- is almost over. Ms. Guillem, 50, is retiring at the end of the year, after a nine-month around-the-world tour. She was recently here and will stop at New York City Center (Nov. 12-14). The tour program, ""Life in Progress,"" features works by Akram Khan, Russell Maliphant, William Forsythe and Mats Ek, and shows Ms. Guillem with almost spookily undimmed powers: Her famously tapering legs and cambered feet, supernaturally high extensions, wonderful coordination, musicality and control seem no different than those of the young dancer who amazed the world when she was made an etoile, or star dancer, at the Paris Opera Ballet at 19. But, Ms. Guillem (pronounced GHEE-lem) who speaks in fast, fluent English, said the fact that she was still dancing at a high level was the reason to stop. ""I don't want to push my luck,"" she said. ""You never know how long it will last. I don't want to be obliged to stop because my body says no.""

Ms. Guillem likes to be in control of her destiny and has never shied away from tough decisions. For good and for ill, she has always followed her own path, often bringing accusations of divadom and willfulness upon her. ""Even when she was young, Sylvie, without any arrogance, understood the value of her own skills,"" said Mr. Forsythe, who first met Ms. Guillem when she was a shy 18-year-old, and established a new context -- ballet as a part of the contemporary world -- for her gifts in his groundbreaking ""In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated"" (1987). ""It wasn't about the leg height, the positions -- it was her coordination, the quality of her motion, the way she internalized the ideas behind the work. She was never going to allow her career to be governed by other peoples' decisions."" What seems normal today, as dancers like Diana Vishneva, Alina Cojocaru and Natalia Osipova dance with multiple companies, negotiate their own contracts, choose their repertory and commission work from choreographers, was almost unheard-of when Ms. Guillem stunned the dance world by leaving the Paris Opera Ballet in 1988, at 24. ""They didn't believe I would do it, because no one ever had,"" she said, explaining that matters came to a head when she asked for her schedule to be determined several months in advance so that she could accept invitations to dance elsewhere. Nureyev, who had supported and promoted her (""He changed my life,"" Ms. Guillem said), understood the issue, but he was unable to change the administrative impasse. ""I think he knew I would go,"" she said.

No one else did; when she left, it made front-page news and was a topic of discussion in France's National Assembly. ""It was no problem for me because I did not have that girlhood dream to become a ballerina,"" she said. ""I had no sense of having reached some goal because I was an etoile at the Paris Opera. My ambition, if you can call it that, was to discover and learn and be excited by what I was doing. If I didn't have that, I would find it elsewhere.""

Ms. Guillem soon found a somewhat unlikely home at the Royal Ballet in London, which offered her the freedom to determine her schedule and roles she would dance, as well as meaty acting roles in ballets by Frederick Ashton and Kenneth MacMillan. She fought with MacMillan and quickly incurred a reputation for intransigence. But she said that she had loved the theatricality and approach of the company and greatly appreciated Anthony Dowell, the artistic director. ""I realize how patient he was with me and how much I looked up to him. He understood me, I think."" It was because of Mr. Dowell, she said, that she lasted 19 years, until 2007, at the Royal. ""I can see now that I was"" -- she hesitated -- ""a little raw. I was young, I felt alone in the jungle, and sometimes you think you need to protect yourself. Maybe I was childish, maybe I didn't want to show weakness. I knew what I wanted and didn't want, and I hadn't made difficult choices to then waste my time. But maybe I could have invited people for tea, and told them gently. Instead I would just say no."" Some critics adored Ms. Guillem's interpretations of the great classical roles and the passion of her acting in the 20th-century repertory; some criticized her liberties with choreography and style. ""Not everything is adaptable to every body,"" Ms. Guillem said when asked about this. In 2005, Ms. Guillem, frustrated by the Royal's reluctance to invite contemporary choreographers to create new work, collaborated with the Ballet Boyz and the choreographer Russell Maliphant, then with Mr. Maliphant alone on a full-evening production, ""Push,"" produced by Sadler's Wells and performed around the world. The next year she joined Sadler's Wells as an artistic associate, and has continued with a steady stream of collaborations: Akram Khan (""Sacred Monsters"") and Robert Lepage (""Eonnagata""), then Mr. Forsythe and Mats Ek in ""6000 Miles Away."" ""What she does looks easy to copy,"" said Alistair Spalding, the director of Sadler's Wells, ""and people are always approaching me now with these ideas. But Sylvie has always had the necessary taste and judgment. She has been a role model not only for people coming to the end of their careers, but for younger performers who see that this is possible. It's a new way of focusing on a particular talent.""

The shift to more contemporary work happened quite naturally, Ms. Guillem said. ""I always wanted to work with choreographers like this. You never know what the person will be like, what you can learn from them, and if you can inspire them. It's a risk, but the rewards are very exciting."" Ms. Guillem has gone on taking risks on her farewell program, which includes new works by Mr. Khan and Mr. Maliphant, as well as Mr. Forsythe's 1996 ""Duo"" (danced by Brigel Gjoka and Riley Watts) and Mr. Ek's solo, the appropriately titled ""Bye."" Does she regret the decision to stop? ""Every day!"" she said. ""But I know what I need to do."" She has no commitments after Dec. 31; she plans to live in Switzerland with her husband, the photographer Gilles Tapie, and their dogs, and to pursue her interests in animal rights, gardening and ceramics. ""I think it's going to be a big shock,"" she said. ""I don't know who I am going to be without this."" Then she brightened, stimulated by another sort of challenge. ""So -- let's just face it.""","The dancer is finishing up her nine-month around-the-world tour, which will include a stop in New York.",8fd5e67c-ced7-5e9b-aaa1-77a99e83ff0d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/08/arts/08DANCE1/1108DANCE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=e6247637b8a808a8f659ece68b595724c7f54bc3dbe3f095425004a94bd11fd3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sylvie Guillem in ""Bye,"" part of her final tour.",8fd5e67c-ced7-5e9b-aaa1-77a99e83ff0d,N24News/imgs/8fd5e67c-ced7-5e9b-aaa1-77a99e83ff0d.jpg,6

For better or worse, today is Valentine's Day. But fear not: We're here to help you get through it. In fact, The New York Times loves to talk about love. We publish essays, podcasts, wedding stories and more. Here's some of the work we like best, sorted to meet your specific need on this fraught day. To start, a few words on love.

We could all just model our notion of love on Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. But alas, none of us are in line for a royal wedding. So The Times culled a few nuggets of wisdom from our Modern Love columns to help people baffled by the world of relationships. Here are some ways to love better -- some of which might surprise you. In a similar vein, we looked through a year's worth of advice to give you eight tips that can better your relationships in 2018. And honestly, it's only February. It isn't too late to try. Really.

If you're alone and want to wallow ... Keep a few things in mind:
* Love is not a feeling that must be confined to another human being; you can feel it intensely for a city, for instance, as this writer does for New York.
* Neither is loneliness. If you think you're having trouble finding a mate, just try being Jeremy, the lefty brown garden snail whose unusual shell made it nearly impossible for him to find a suitable partner.
* For every warm and fuzzy love story, there's a crushing tale of heartbreak. We even compiled proof. Here are a few tales of breakups and bad dates that are sure to make you happy to be alone.
* And, even if you think you're in love, there's a pretty good chance you will marry the wrong person. Awesome, right?

It's easy! As this now-famous Modern Love essay tells us, just ask the person you wish to fall for this series of 36 increasingly personal questions. (If, however, you find that those questions worked entirely too well and you've made a terrible mistake -- i.e. ""married the wrong person"" -- you can extricate yourself with these 13 questions that lead to divorce.) Or take an example from someone else. The Times often writes about how couples go from dating to ""I Do."" One of the most memorable recent stories of this kind came from C.J. Chivers, who won a Pulitzer Prize for a 2016 article about an Afghan war veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Last year, he wrote again about the veteran, the woman who had loved the veteran since elementary school, and the long, weary road to their wedding day. So, you say you still need to buy your sweetheart a gift? Wirecutter has some great suggestions. This guide includes everything from a sleeping bag built for two to the perfect bottle of pink bubbly. For those who already caved and bought flowers at the drugstore, we can at least offer you some guidance on how to make them last longer.

Global Business,I.M.F. Says Euro Zone Remains Vulnerable,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/16/business/global/imf-says-euro-zone-remains-vulnerable.html,"FRANKFURT -- The euro zone remains vulnerable to shocks because of weak banks and incomplete regulatory safeguards, the International Monetary Fund said Friday, in a warning to European leaders not to slacken their efforts to build a more resilient financial system.

In its first official assessment of the European Union financial system, the I.M.F. urged political leaders to show resolve in addressing the remaining weaknesses in the structure of the euro zone. Unfinished tasks include creation of a mechanism for winding down failed banks, and a system to guarantee customer deposits in order to prevent runs on banks, the I.M.F. said.

The fund praised the decision by euro zone leaders last year to concentrate bank supervision in the hands of the European Central Bank, rather than solely with national regulators who have sometimes been reluctant to impose tough measures on their home banks. But, in a 60-page report, the fund also said that a lot of work remained to be done.

Opinion,Testing Is on the Brink of Paralysis. That's Very Bad News.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/opinion/coronavirus-testing-us.html,"As Covid-19 cases surge to their highest levels in dozens of states, the nation's testing effort is on the brink of paralysis because of widespread delays in getting back results. And that is very bad news, because even if testing is robust, the pandemic cannot be controlled without rapid results. This is the latest failure in our national response to the worst pandemic in a century. Since the Trump administration has abdicated responsibility, governors must join forces to meet this threat before the cataclysm that Florida is experiencing becomes the reality across the country. Testing should be the governors' first order of business. Despite President Trump's boast early this month that testing ""is so massive and so good,"" the United States' two largest commercial testing companies, Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp, have found themselves overwhelmed and unable to return results promptly. Delays averaging a week or longer for all but top-priority hospital patients and symptomatic health care workers are disastrous for efforts to slow the spread of the virus. Without rapid results, it is impossible to isolate new infections quickly enough to douse flare-ups before they grow. Slow diagnosis incapacitates contact tracing, which entails not only isolating those who test positive but also alerting the infected person's contacts quickly so they can quarantine, too, and avoid exposing others to the virus unwittingly.

Among those who waited an absurdly long time for her results was the mayor of Atlanta, Keisha Lance Bottoms. ""We FINALLY received our test results taken 8 days before,"" she tweeted last week. ""One person in my house was positive then. By the time we tested again, 1 week later, 3 of us had COVID. If we had known sooner, we would have immediately quarantined."" Another complaint came this week from Mr. Trump's former acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who wrote in an op-ed commentary for CNBC that ""my son was tested recently; we had to wait 5 to 7 days for results."" Noting, too, that his daughter was told she didn't qualify for a test, he added, ""That is simply inexcusable at this point in the pandemic."" As summer turns to fall, slow and fragmented testing will fatally undermine the reopening of schools and universities, whose plans are predicated on quickly identifying outbreaks and suppressing spread. Testing for millions of students will feed into an already failing national system. Vice President Mike Pence's casual invocation of an ""extraordinary national success in testing"" in a recent call with governors was flatly wrong, as is the president's similar trumpeting of testing success. These claims contribute to a false sense among the public that testing may have had early stumbles but is ramping up slowly but surely. The reality is that the spread of the virus has vastly outpaced the expansion of testing capacity. That spread in turn results in more illness and therefore more tests to process, which further slows down turnaround time in a vicious cycle. The dedication and patience of thousands of people waiting in serpentine lines of cars for hours to be tested are wasted when the results aren't returned quickly enough.

We are at this point because of the absence of a coordinated federal plan, and, indeed, because of a White House that seems actively hostile to producing one. The nation's governors and state legislators must fill the void. Unity among the states is not just about neighborliness but also about self-interest. So long as interstate travel continues, inadequate testing anywhere threatens public health everywhere, including in places that have found or developed localized testing capacities and are less sensitive to the bottlenecks that Quest and LabCorp are experiencing. The signal difference between federal and state leadership is that the former can print money and the latter cannot. If states are to step up, they will need resources: money from Congress without executive branch holdup, coordination and mutual aid from one another, and cooperation and expertise from the public itself. Here's what the governors need to do to bolster the overall testing capability before the end of the summer, best begun with a summit in the next two weeks. Governors must work collectively to fill gaps in their own testing and contact-tracing programs. The National Governors Association helped in a similar effort to curb the spread of the Zika virus. In March there was a mad scramble and competition for personal protective equipment. Now, the allocation of tests and test processing may end up in another free-for-all. A coordinated approach by all states would avoid that. Consistent metrics must be established for accountability and to identify trigger points that call for rapid policy responses. Acting in concert can make it easier to undertake tough or controversial decisions like ordering lockdowns when testing shows renewed spread. Governors should also agree to assist in sharing local test processing capacity, including by university labs, so it is available wherever it is most needed. Relying largely on two large commercial testing companies, as we are now, has proved to be a major vulnerability.",Our pandemic fight requires prompt testing results — and singular cooperation among the states to achieve them.,56b0a492-9731-55b8-ac48-be3d758b2389,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/17/opinion/14zittrain/14zittrain-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=cff4a80197519584c4d262d1ec0f4f99ae497e5dcaad46334a12f2254ee6e108&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Drivers waiting to be tested for the coronavirus at the Hard Rock Stadium parking lot in Miami Gardens, Fla., last week.",56b0a492-9731-55b8-ac48-be3d758b2389,N24News/imgs/56b0a492-9731-55b8-ac48-be3d758b2389.jpg,11
Automobiles,Arriving in Style Just as the Tailgate Party Winds Down,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/automobiles/autoreviews/arriving-in-style-just-as-the-tailgate-party-winds-down.html,"Considering the rarity of station wagons in America, BMW's new tailgating 3 Series set me wondering: who exactly spends $50,000 or more on a compact wagon, instead of going the usual American route with an S.U.V. or a crossover? In certain locales scented with artisanal coffee and self-affirmation -- college towns, gentrified urban blocks, Ralph Lauren suburbs -- the natives have circled the wagons for what may be their last stand. Strangely, considering the station wagon's wood-paneled role in American cultural history, today's downsized models rarely seem to have children on board. Instead, they seem to be favored by bearded software developers, practical-performance iconoclasts and empty nesters in mourning for the boxy old Volvos and Subarus they once drove. Like many people who write about cars, I also have a thing for wagons, the more out-there, the better. For instance, the Cadillac CTS-V, Mercedes E63 AMG and Ferrari FF wagons -- the latter the most unexpected of all -- make a combined 1,784 horsepower, and their average top speed is nearly 195 m.p.h. But you're as likely to see a Lamborghini at your local Dairy Queen as to spot any of those exotic family haulers pulling up for Xtreme Blizzards. To ensure their survival, even mainstream wagons may soon need a nature preserve -- perhaps a simulated ""Leave It to Beaver"" environment of pink houses and picket fences.

This year, Americans have just nine wagon models to choose from, down from 24 in 2004, according to LMC Automotive, an industry research firm. Their percentage of the market, not strong to begin with, slipped to 1.1 percent last year, to a paltry 165,000 sales. (A single model, the Subaru Outback, accounted for 112,000 of those.) As the enlarged version of the latest 3 Series sedan, the 328i xDrive does its part to keep wagons from extinction. It's an especially handsome member of its herd, with a squinty version of BMW's twin-kidney grille and a streamlined, scalloped fuselage. Compared with the former model, the Sports Wagon has grown 3.5 inches in length and almost 2 inches in wheelbase. The BMW's track, or the space between the opposing wheels, is 1.2 inches wider up front and 1.6 inches in back. The result is nearly an inch more of legroom in the back seat and an 8 percent increase in cargo volume, to 53 cubic feet. For all of a wagon's advantages over S.U.V.'s -- reduced weight, better aerodynamics and mileage, generally superior handling -- its relatively low roofline remains the biggest practical demerit. BMW's X3 crossover S.U.V. can fit 62 percent more gear behind its second row and nearly 20 percent more over all. That includes taller, bulkier items -- furniture, bicycles, boxes -- than the wagon can swallow.

Yet the new BMW makes the most of its modest dimensions. The redesign, which includes more high-strength steel, carves out a larger hatch opening. The load floor is lower to the ground, too, for easier lifting of cargo. A power tailgate opens via the remote key or an interior button. If you order the Comfort Access feature, the tailgate swings open when you wiggle a foot under the rear bumper, a useful hands-free feature first offered by Ford. The rear seat folds flat in a 40-20-40 arrangement, making it easy to haul, say, four sets of skis for four passengers. The cargo area gets four tie-downs, a 12-volt outlet and coat hooks. With run-flat tires eliminating the spare, there's extra space under the floor; in a clever touch, the retracting rear luggage cover detaches for storage below deck when it's not needed. A rear-view camera with a 360-degree top-down view, part of a $1,900 Driver Assistance Package, made it a breeze to park without scraping the pretty 18-inch alloy rims on the curb.

Figuring there's no sense importing myriad models to satisfy a tiny cult of American wagon enthusiasts, BMW offers only xDrive all-wheel-drive versions with the excellent 8-speed automatic transmission. So there's no rear-drive version, no manual transmission and no 335i variant with its turbocharged 300-horsepower in-line 6. What BMW does offer is gasoline and diesel engines whose performance and mileage are unmatched in its field. The 328i gets the 2-liter turbo TwinPower 4 with 241 horses and 258 pound-feet of torque. That gas-burning wagon hustles to 60 m.p.h. in six seconds, with the free-revving brio and wall-to-wall torque that's a signature of this remarkable motor. Stand outside, and you'll hear the engine's tick-tick idle and direct-injector noise, but the uncouth behavior disappears once the car is under way. The same can't be said for the standard engine stop-start function, which restarts the car at stoplights with an intrusive shudder.

The 328i is also rated at 22 miles per gallon in town and 33 on the highway, and that's no fooling. Set to its EcoPro mode, the BMW actually indicated 35 m.p.g. over a long 60 m.p.h. cruise -- commendable economy for such a strong, relatively spacious car. Premium fuel, of course, is required. That Eco Pro setting saves gas by softening the accelerator response, selecting higher gears and dialing back the power to systems like the heated seats and climate control. Drivers can select Comfort and Sport settings as well. As in other BMWs with this small-caliber engine, the wagon sipped responsibly even when my driving was anything but. Hammered from New York to Boston in a convoy with a Corvette and two German sedans, the BMW still returned 30 m.p.g. A truly miserly wagon master can opt for the diesel version, the 328d xDrive, which starts at $43,875, a reasonable $1,500 premium over the gasoline-sipping car. The 328d's 2-liter turbodiesel -- with 180 horsepower and 280 pound-feet of torque -- is rated 31 m.p.g. city, 43 highway. (The same diesel engine in the rear-drive 328d sedan achieves 32/45 m.p.g.) Nor is the diesel wagon a slouch in acceleration, moving from a standstill to 60 m.p.h. in 7.7 seconds. BMW says the new wagon's structure is 10 percent stiffer. Ride quality, even with the run-flat tires, is smoother than Robin Thicke at a Ladies' Night. Yet there's a growing chink in the BMW's once-impregnable armor. This is the softest, spongiest 3 Series I can recall, with too little feedback from the electric power steering. The steering is accuracy itself, and the BMW will still fly through curves. But on initial flights, neither the car nor the driver gains the confidence you expect from this handling benchmark. Opting for the $1,000 Dynamic Handling Package, which adds variable sport steering and a stiffer M sport suspension, should help firm the flab. But let's hope that the coming 4 Series coupe can provide a template for BMW to get the 3 Series back on the fun-to-drive track.","In an environment crowded with S.U.V.'s and crossovers, vehicles that buyers seem to prefer, station wagons are becoming things of the past.

Sports,"SEC Reaches $3 Billion Deal With Disney, Drawing CBS Ties Toward an End",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/sports/ncaafootball/sec-disney-deal.html,"The broadcast rights to the Southeastern Conference's biggest football games, like the annual Iron Bowl matchup between Alabama and Auburn, have been purchased by Disney, meaning that all of the league's games will appear on its networks including ABC and ESPN for 10 years starting in 2024. The agreement, announced Thursday evening by the ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro at Disney's investor day, will end the SEC's nearly three-decade association with CBS, and give Disney ownership of all of the SEC's lucrative, and accordingly expensive, media rights. ESPN will pay the SEC around $300 million annually for the rights, according to two people with knowledge of the agreement who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to speak publicly. That is nearly a sixfold increase from the $55 million annually CBS currently pays. ABC will show Saturday afternoon SEC games, ""as well as selected Saturday primetime football games"" according to an SEC news release. That is in addition to other SEC football games that will appear across ESPN cable channels and the ESPN+ streaming service.

""We will be able to schedule games on any network in any of the windows, which will allow for flexibility in that regard vis-a-vis teams that would prefer to be at night and afternoon,"" said Burke Magnus, an ESPN executive, at a news conference. Greg Sankey, the SEC's commissioner, indicated that Disney's scheduling flexibility across times and networks was a key consideration in the conference's sale of the rights to it. ""One of our primary goals was to improve the television scheduling process in ways that will benefit our students, coaches, alumni and fans,"" Sankey said in the news release. ""With all SEC events now under The Walt Disney Company umbrella, we were able to craft an agreement that includes more lead time for many game time announcements, and in many ways modernizes the college football scheduling process."" The new deal, worth at least $3 billion in total, adds on to Disney's existing foothold in the SEC. CBS has been the signature television home of SEC football since 1996, and of the conference's championship game since 2001. Even after ESPN signed a $2 billion agreement with the SEC in 2008, and then created the SEC Network in 2013 and extended its agreement with the conference through 2034, CBS retained the rights to one SEC football game each week. Importantly, CBS also got the first choice of games each week. The network's 3:30 p.m. Eastern slot was effectively appointment television on autumn Saturdays, and CBS also had some SEC doubleheaders and the league championship game.

The SEC and CBS signed a 15-year rights agreement in 2008, just before an explosion of television money reached college sports. Even after the SEC expanded and created the SEC Network with ESPN, the financial terms of its agreement with CBS remained unchanged -- and ultimately became a fantastic bargain for CBS. With the new agreement, the SEC could overtake the Big Ten Conference as the richest league in college sports. The SEC, home to 10 of the last 14 national champions in football, swaggers more than any other league in college football, with a slogan -- ""it just means more"" -- that elicits as many knowing nods as sneers and jokes. The conference, which is based in Birmingham, Ala., and includes powerhouses like Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Louisiana State, distributed more than $624 million to its 14 schools for the 2018-19 fiscal year, the most recent year for which data is available. Only a decade earlier, the SEC, then with a dozen members, paid out $132.5 million to its universities. And while the league can credit ESPN for much of its recent financial rise, CBS has remained an integral part of college football culture in the South. Many fans referred to the longtime announcers Verne Lundquist, who retired from SEC football in 2016, and Gary Danielson by their first names. This fall, even the pandemic-delayed Masters golf tournament effectively planned the timing of its third round to accommodate sunset -- and CBS's plans for the Alabama at L.S.U. game, an ordinarily titanic matchup that has long drawn viewers. (The game was eventually postponed because of coronavirus issues at L.S.U., and the rescheduled matchup drew disappointing ratings, partly because of how L.S.U. has declined since it won last season's national title.) It became apparent a year ago that the SEC's relationship with CBS would conclude at the end of the contract, if not sooner, as conferences struck ever-richer deals. Sports Business Journal reported last December that CBS had pulled out of bidding on an extension of the agreement.","The Southeastern Conference is poised to become the richest conference in college football after it struck a television deal with Disney, which owns ABC and ESPN.",08e4d951-c60d-57d7-b59d-aa1964e0175f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/10/sports/10sec-media/10sec-media-facebookJumbo.jpg,Alabama facing Auburn in the Iron Bowl is one of the marquee games of the Southeastern Conference each year.

Fashion & Style,The Great Fashion Week Migration,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/fashion/new-york-fashion-week-oscar-de-la-renta-monse-proenza-schouler.html,"Stars and stripes were projected on the Beaux-Arts facade of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue. The steps were lined with a green stream of Statue of Liberty impersonators. The rotunda was filled with an equally round proscenium, complete with drum set and keyboards waiting for The Kills to take the stage. The show was an hour late. Everyone was waiting for Madonna. Not me. I left after it hadn't started by 10 p.m., and I checked it out on my computer. No one embraces their own terrible taste with as much unrepentant gusto as the German designer Philipp Plein, who usually shows in Milan but who on Monday night brought his P .T. Barnum fashion to New York for the first time, seemingly with no sense of how tone-deaf the whole display was -- from bustier to thigh-high boots, from fire-and-brimstone embroidery to NASA puffer coats.

Mr. Plein came to New York because he is expanding in the United States, and on each seat was a look book urging to ""Make New York Fashion Week great again."" But what he showed wasn't style. It was self-indulgence. Don't be distracted by the pyrotechnics. For fashion, you had to look elsewhere: to a show that heralded a beginning, and one that marked an ending. At Oscar de la Renta, a house that has been in some turmoil since the death of its founder in 2014, the former design director Laura Kim and design assistant Fernando Garcia made their debut as creative directors just under two years after they left to start their own brand, Monse, which they showed before the Oscar collection, as a kind of opening act. And at Proenza Schouler, the designers Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough, favorite sons of the city, were saying farewell; as of July, they will move their show to Europe and to the couture schedule. Both collections were worthy of attention because of what they put on the runway: ideas that reflected a turning point. It's where we are. Mr. Garcia and Ms. Kim took some shears to de la Renta, where they gave the brand the fashion equivalent of a haircut, transforming it from a shellacked bouffant into slick, swinging ponytail. Off with the frills!

""When I was trying to get them to come back, Fernando said, 'You know, I'm afraid you don't have the guts to make it young,' "" Alexander Bolen, the brand's chief executive, said in a preview before the show. But ""young"" is a relative term. The Monse collection was younger in the poet-meets-pirates-of-venture-capital sense (lots of shoulders unzipped to show skin, cargo pants, shearling, albeit too many flapping luggage strap belts, terrific twisted velvets). De la Renta, immediately afterward, was younger in a flexible, Pilates-sculpted sense. Full of ... pants.

Black cigarette numbers were paired with everything from standard tuxedo jackets to devore and mini paillette-paved corsetry molded or draped at the hips. That mix of smoking elegance and heritage swag has become a familiar trope of a new designer at an old house since Raf Simons landed at Dior (his now-former job), but that doesn't make it any less attractive.

Also good: small-shoulder ankle-length coats slit above the waist at the side for an elongated line, strapless bell-shape party dresses that hit not the floor but the ankle, and a color palette that mixed silver with shell pink and orange, or sea blue with forest green and black. It wasn't as original as Monse (it wasn't so original at all), and it isn't necessarily time to bring back the mini-pouf skirt (also: who wants to wear a giant fur skirt?), but the show was coherent and had a cosmopolitan, cleaned-up edge. Martini glass optional.

The arty edge, however, belongs to Proenza Schouler, a brand that began colonizing the Chelsea gallery scene more than a decade ago -- at least as it exists in some shared industrial-chic imagination. This collection was a case in point, dipping in and out of a familiar vocabulary: high-waist trousers bloused at the hip and pegged at the ankle, oversize outerwear dangling skinny logo ribbons from zippers, and jackets wrapped and belted at the waist, so pockets were pulled atop (a treatment that also showed up more specifically at The Row in a lavishly understated collection).","Philipp Plein comes to New York, Proenza Schouler says farewell, and new designers debut at Oscar de la Renta.",f13db19c-d53b-551d-9531-9b8eae898ef0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/15/fashion/14oscar-A/14oscar-A-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=0c2297b18adb4bdeed01c6e1a31b2733f7d6ffb079769e8efc7fe9396749b1e5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Oscar de la Renta, fall 2017.",f13db19c-d53b-551d-9531-9b8eae898ef0,N24News/imgs/f13db19c-d53b-551d-9531-9b8eae898ef0.jpg,19
Travel,What Do Millennials Want? Hotels Have Some Ideas,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/travel/millennials-hotels.html,"Hotels are concluding that millennial travelers want three things: customized experiences, digital convenience and relevant information on social media. Call it Canopy by Hilton, Moxy by Marriott or Element by Starwood, traditional hotel chains are catering to the tastes of young adults who have never known a world without the Internet. Even Best Western, known for its budget hotels, has announced plans for a new brand called GLo, which will offer lower-priced small rooms and free high-speed Internet. According to Phocuswright research, seven in 10 18- to 34-year-olds took at least one leisure trip in 2014, and while millennials spend slightly less annually ($3,217) than older travelers ($3,381), they do travel more on the fly. Almost a quarter of Gen Y travelers booked their last trip less than one week before departure, says Phocuswright. ""We see millennial travelers more as explorers than tourists,"" said Brian McGuinness, global brand leader, Starwood's Specialty Select Brands. ""Our Aloft hotels are specifically designed with them in mind.""

Aloft features free Wi-Fi, areas for working poolside or in the bar, and even a robotic bellhop that appeals to tech-savvy millennials, he said. Now, guests who are too busy to talk to a human can order from an emoji room-service menu by texting a string of emoji with their last name and room number to Aloft TiGi (which stands for Text it. Get it.). The pilot program is available at Aloft Manhattan Downtown, Aloft Liverpool and Aloft London Excel, and will go to Aloft properties in Asia next. On the menu are things like a hangover kit of Vitaminwater, Advil and bananas for $10; a phone charger for $25; a Surprise Me package of what the Aloft emoji room-service menu calls ""fun swag and cool stuff"" for $25, and more. ""If I'm traveling for work, and it's late, I want a hotel where the food is good, and the delivery is quick,"" said Sherrelle Banks, 28, a communications analyst for Fidelity Investments in Westlake, Tex. ""Clean, nonsmoking rooms are a must."" When it comes to leisure travel, Ms. Banks said that she takes photos of everything in the hotels where she stays -- the lobby, the view from the room, and the room itself -- along with vacation shots of activities to share with friends and family.

""I post almost everything on social media,"" Ms. Banks said. ""People who saw pictures of my trip to Costa Rica on Facebook said they want to go with me next time."" To grab the attention of millennials who regularly use social media, Marriott International has gone Hollywood by running its own studio to create short films, TV shows and webisodes that promote its various brands, said David Beebe, vice president for global creative and content marketing at Marriott International. Marriott Content Studio has created shows like ""Navigator Live,"" which gave guests in Renaissance Hotels a look at a city through the eyes of touring musicians. The show also ran on the cable network AXS TV. Short films like the action comedy ""Two Bellmen Two,"" about two bellmen who save the day when a guest's business presentation goes missing, was filmed at the J.W. Marriott Marquis Dubai and garnered 7.9 million YouTube views. The film, which will soon be featured on Emirates Airline, is also shown in a number of Marriott hotels. The short films are created by Marriott Content Studio executives and Hollywood producers like Ian Sander and Kim Moses (whose credits include the television series ""Ghost Whisperer"" and ""Profiler"") who produced ""French Kiss,"" a romantic tale set at the Paris Marriott Champs-Elysees. ""French Kiss"" has received 6.1 million YouTube views, and also has been seen on flights on JetBlue and American among other airlines, and in certain Marriott hotels. Information on the company's 19 social media brand campaigns is monitored at its headquarters in Bethesda, Md., using a screen that tracks pop culture events and allows staff members to create real-time marketing opportunities, like its recent Super Bowl ""Suite Stadium Contest"" that gave a winner and three guests an overnight stay at Levi's Stadium the night before the Super Bowl in a converted guest room suite, along with tickets to the game. ""Marriott is trailblazing marketing infrastructure for major hospitality brands, using platforms such as Snapchat and context-specific video content to build brand awareness and encourage participation,"" Andrew Alvarez, a hospitality industry analyst for IBISWorld, an industry research company based in New York, said in an email. Marriott's Renaissance Hotels have also introduced Evenings at Renaissance, a free event for guests featuring local craft beverages chosen by the hotel bartender and local drink experts. The program is part of the brand's new It's Business Unusual global campaign to appeal to young entrepreneurial business travelers.

Hotel chains are also trying to draw young adults to their brands with music-related loyalty program events, like Hilton@PLAY's concerts. In December, for example, Hilton presented Neon Trees at the Washington Hilton in the District of Columbia for an exclusive performance for guests. Hilton HHonors members can redeem points to attend such concerts, or can make a gift of the experiences to others. Apps that allow hotel guests to select rooms, check in digitally or order a burger before arrival are becoming standard mobile features, while social media like Hilton Suggests Twitter handle (@HiltonSuggests) shares recommendations from contributors around the world for everything from where to eat to what to do and see. ""It's the concierge for the social age,"" said Mary Beth Parks, senior vice president for global marketing for Hilton Worldwide. Because 44 percent of millennials prefer booking hotel services from a mobile phone, versus 26 percent of baby boomers, according to IHG's 2015 Trends Report, it's no surprise that IHG is using mobile for more personalized service with customers. The company, with brands including InterContinental, Kimpton, EVEN, Indigo and Crowne Plaza, is running a pilot program in IHG hotels in China that places beacons in the lobbies and restaurants that recognize rewards club members using the IHG app nearby. ""These beacons then send information to the guest's smartphone, including personalized notifications and offers,"" said Heather Balsley, IHG senior vice president, Americas Brand Management.","With Wi-Fi, craft beverages, concerts, ordering room service by emoji, hotel chains are trying to appeal to young travelers with a new playbook.",3d231be7-5105-5d50-b80a-ed52de27be54,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/10/travel/10HOTELS/10HOTELS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=48f81b76305b2b16b3b388a71e318c2d9cc792c3457b1d0b94ff498bf495c509&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Even Hotel Times Square, where the vibe is sleek and savvy.",3d231be7-5105-5d50-b80a-ed52de27be54,N24News/imgs/3d231be7-5105-5d50-b80a-ed52de27be54.jpg,4
Automobiles,Ford Wants to Take Next Mustang to New Places,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/06/automobiles/ford-wants-to-take-next-mustang-to-new-places.html,"Online media leaks aside, the 2015 Ford Mustang is, officially, no longer a secret after its unveiling Thursday morning in New York City and five other sites around the world. Alan R. Mulally, Ford's chief executive, spoke at the New York opening, noting that it was here, at the 1964 World's Fair, that the Mustang was first introduced to an enthusiastic public. ""It's so fun to be back here 50 years later to introduce the completely new, sleek-styled Ford Mustang,"" he said at the news conference, next to a 2015 Mustang convertible. A turbocharged fastback model sat outside.

""Not only is this a world-class sports car that's been in production for 50 years, it's going to be available to everyone around the world,"" Mr. Mulally said in an interview before the unveiling. Lower and wider than the current, retro-styled generation, which made its debut for the 2005 model year, Ford's new car still has the long snout, blunt nose and short rear deck that has come to define the pony car genre over five decades. Ford's engineers were able to squeeze more interior space into the car -- adding hip and shoulder room to the new model, as well as a trunk large enough to accommodate two golf bags.

Aside from sheet-metal changes, the new model has been the recipient of striking suspension and power plant revisions. For the first time, the Mustang will have a modern independent rear suspension instead of the old-fashioned live axle that has been a mainstay of past models. Ford said the improved rear suspension led to refinement of the front suspension, too. It now features a double-ball-joint MacPherson strut design that the automaker says improves stability over previous models and allows for the installation of larger front brakes. Along with engine choices that include a 300-horsepower 3.7-liter V6 and a 420-horsepower 5-liter V8, Ford has added a 305-horsepower 2.3-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder, a turbocharged engine that it says will be more appealing in overseas markets where gasoline costs more than in the United States.

MyFord Touch, the heart of Ford's in-car infotainment system, had come under fire in recent years over its reliability and ease of use, notably by J.D. Power and Consumer Reports. But Mr. Mulally said Ford had simplified the system, adding knobs where customers said they preferred a tactile interface. There's no word on whether the new Mustang will get all-wheel drive and other upgrades, but Mr. Mulally suggested that such features remained possible. ""Everyone who knows the Mustang knows that there will be a lot of fabulous derivatives,"" he said. He said that the car's distinctiveness, powertrain options and utility would make it an attractive option for consumers around the world. One of its major features, he added, will be affordability. ""On Jan. 24, 1925, Henry Ford laid out his plan, in an ad, to open the highways to all mankind,"" Mr. Mulally said. ""We are accelerating Henry Ford's vision, and the next proof point of that is the new Mustang. Fifty years after Lee Iacocca introduced the Mustang, it has world-class performance, but will continue to be one of the most affordable sports cars.""","Ford unveiled its new Mustang on Thursday morning, but unlike the pony car released in 1964, this one will be sold globally.",724833a2-736d-5318-b1dc-ed3e0fe1dc9c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/06/automobiles/06MUSTANG-image/06MUSTANG-image-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=04fe862abc1945848a2eb94c01f314065b09bcd4c516f9ced180871ff076fc9e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Alan Mulally, chief executive of Ford, standing with the 2015 Ford Mustang convertible at its unveiling in Manhattan.",724833a2-736d-5318-b1dc-ed3e0fe1dc9c,N24News/imgs/724833a2-736d-5318-b1dc-ed3e0fe1dc9c.jpg,23
Fashion & Style,The 2017 U.S. Open Winners: Brooks Koepka and 'Millennial Pink',https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/fashion/us-open-brooks-koepka-millennial-pink.html,"As to why, well, it can't have escaped sportswear behemoths Nike, Adidas and Uniqlo that an entire generation of consumers whose hearts and minds and wallets the companies would like to capture has displayed an affinity for this range of rose-colored shades. Nor can they have missed the fact that public figures of all sorts including Gwyneth Paltrow, Harry Styles and Rihanna have suddenly started sporting (yes, I meant to use that word) clothes in said colors. Over the weekend, not only did Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, wear a bright pink Alexander McQueen dress to the Trooping the Color parade in honor of Queen Elizabeth's birthday, but she also dressed her daughter, Princess Charlotte, in a pink party frock.

When golfers and royalty make the same sartorial choices, you know it's not just a fashion thing. Millennial pink may have started as a runway trend for both men and women -- the Gucci designer Alessandro Michele and his muse Jared Leto love a dose of pink -- but it has become something else: a shorthand or symbol of this particular moment in time, from the looser definitions of gender and gender stereotypes to the refusal to be boxed in to a traditional set of dress code mores and expectations.

That it has reached critical mass in unexpected places, like the fairway, simply speaks to its use as a means of connecting a person or a discipline that might seem elitist or inaccessible to the values of a larger group. Can you relate?",The very rosy palette that many players chose on the tournament's penultimate day is already a strong favorite with young consumers.,8c5807b3-c3b5-5e54-bce7-e4bed98f10d1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/20/fashion/19otr-AA/19otr-A-1497869816944-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=5127686bf9eeba0297e9af74242ac60b6f2691c02b0a9626460b3e0824550e72&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Justin Thomas, left, in trousers by Ralph Lauren, and Jonathan Randolph during the U.S. Open on Saturday at Erin Hills in Wisconsin.",8c5807b3-c3b5-5e54-bce7-e4bed98f10d1,N24News/imgs/8c5807b3-c3b5-5e54-bce7-e4bed98f10d1.jpg,19
Music,"Amina Claudine Myers, a Singer Who Still Needs No Words",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/14/arts/music/amina-claudine-myers-gospel.html,"Amina Claudine Myers has recorded 11 albums as a leader since 1979. In October, she'll debut a new program at the Community Church in Midtown.

Amina Claudine Myers was sitting in her apartment in Hell's Kitchen, surrounded by paintings and photographs as she recalled a rehearsal there almost 40 years ago. She'd been playing the same baby grand piano that sits in the living room today, and Cecil McBee had brought his upright bass. She recalled that sounds came spontaneously to her lips. ""I do remember thinking: You don't need words to express,"" she said. ""Just your voice, the sound, can relay a message.""

Now 76, Ms. Myers never became a top name, but devotees know her as an uncategorizable force, someone who can communicate powerfully through poetry, piano, organ and voice, and even as an actor. She has recorded 11 albums as a leader since 1979 -- mostly solo or trio efforts -- but her legacy runs much deeper.

[Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] When she sings, especially without words, Ms. Myers's voice can work like a horn or a drum -- an instrument in which air passes straight through, responding directly to the vessel. Her vocals don't have the clothespin tightness of a scat singer or the loose delirium of a gospel crescendo, but you can hear her savoring every note. In her piano playing, the blues, the black church, classical music and free improvising coexist. She often paints in warm, billowing sheets, skirting both the classic lexicon of traditional jazz and the brazen outsiderism of the avant-garde.

On Oct. 19, in a performance at the Community Church of New York, in Midtown, Ms. Myers will debut a new program celebrating the classic gospel groups of the 1950s. The music will also reach into Ms. Myers's songbook, and the black spirituals of the slavery era. She'll be joined by Generation IV, a group featuring Pyeng Threadgill, Luna Threadgill-Moderbacher and Richarda Abrams, all children and grandchildren of Ms. Myers's longtime associates in the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians, or A.A.C.M. And, covering the repertory of groups like the Staples Singers and the Gospel Harmonettes, she'll be accompanied by memories of her own childhood.

Born in 1942 in the tiny hamlet of Blackwell, Ark., Ms. Myers grew up playing the piano at Baptist and Methodist church functions, and leading gospel quartets. After graduating from college, she moved to Chicago and in 1966 joined the A.A.C.M., a newly formed group of black composers dedicated to shepherding one another's work. She developed a particularly close musical partnership with the pianist Muhal Richard Abrams (""my spiritual brother,"" she said). At the same time, she was gigging with Gene Ammons and Sonny Stitt, eminent soul-jazz figures. She soon began writing poetry and setting it to music. Her first serious work was ""I Dream,"" a set of songs for choir and band. She continues to compose ambitious, large-form pieces -- a long-gestating opera based on the life of Harriet Tubman remains in the works -- but of late Ms. Myers has been performing solo almost exclusively. The shows I've seen have been transcendent. In 2016, playing at the Community Church, she sang a tired, disillusioned, defiant original, her voice rising on a slant as she repeated a biting refrain: ""Ain't nobody ever gonna hear us/Ain't nobody hearing us now."" But moments later, drawing the concert to a close, she played a simple, lapping, major-to-minor progression, and insisted on gratitude. ""Thank you for life,"" she sang. ""Thank you for blessings/Thank you for family/Thank you.""","The 76-year-old performer will debut a new program that celebrates 1950s gospel, black spirituals and her own songbook in October.",8a1a93b4-3b75-5fcc-b7a1-9ded701990a2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/16/arts/16AMINA1/16AMINA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=ba2e25d875c3f70c0a1c0aeef44203eb4ec2f60147d96cfedaae6d63f8e3c8ba&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Amina Claudine Myers has recorded 11 albums as a leader since 1979.

Style,Early Vaccines for Santa? Not So Fast.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/style/santa-christmas-performers-covid.html,"Ric Erwin is one of thousands of men for whom Santa Claus is both a sacred idea and a seasonal occupation. Earlier this year, he was looking forward to donning his red velvet suit and hat this December, just as he has each winter for the last decade. But the pandemic has thrown a wrench in the usual Christmas shows and shopping mall photo ops. And Mr. Erwin, 62, who is the chairman of the board of the Fraternal Order of Real Bearded Santas -- a national association for men who grow and maintain their own beards to play Santa Claus at holiday events -- has found himself advocating for 500 professionals to safely support their work while virus cases are surging. [How Santas in New York are staying safe this year.] In September, Mr. Erwin, who lives in Hemet, Calif., testified virtually before the Centers for Disease Control's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. He noted that the production and distribution of an H1N1 vaccine in 2009 allowed Santa Claus performers to save Christmas that year. He hoped the C.D.C. could similarly expedite a vaccine in time for this holiday season.

""That sounded like a great deal to us,"" Mr. Erwin said. ""Within 24 hours we had over 100 volunteers. The response was overwhelming."" Mr. Caputo told Mr. Erwin he couldn't wait to tell President Trump that the Santas were onboard with the plan. Then, Mr. Erwin said, Mr. Caputo, the C.D.C. and the H.H.S. ghosted him. Mr. Erwin realized Mr. Caputo was never going to call him back when The Wall Street Journal published an article in late October stating that the campaign, which was meant to include not only Santa players but also celebrities, had been scrapped. (In a statement to The New York Times, an H.H.S. spokeswoman reiterated: ""This collaboration will not be happening."") ""We saw the handwriting on the wall and we knew there was not going to be a collaboration at that point, so if we were going to save Christmas this year it was just going to be the Clauses,"" Mr. Erwin said.

In addition to stoking some false hope, his negotiations with the federal government drew attention to the myriad societies Santa Claus performers belong to today (though the word ""performers"" is scorned by those who take a method approach to the role). There are regional groups (like the Lone Star Santas and the New England Santa Society), as well as national and international ones. For the most part, these organizations try to stay out of politics, activism and other kinds of campaigning. So some Santas were annoyed.

""First of all, Santa lives in the North Pole -- he doesn't live in the United States,"" said Stephen Arnold, 70, a Memphis resident and president of the International Brotherhood of Real Bearded Santas (I.B.R.B.S.), a trade group with more than 2,000 members. ""He might have an interest in seeing that the United States is a calm and safe place for him to visit and deliver Christmas presents, but as a Santa Claus, you shouldn't have a political posture."" Mr. Arnold added that his understanding was that only four or five people would end up eligible for an early shot of the vaccine according to the offer Mr. Caputo made to Mr. Erwin.

To be fair, Mr. Arnold and Mr. Erwin have some history. The Fraternal Order of Real Bearded Santas (F.O.R.B.S.) emerged out of the dissolution more than a decade ago of the Amalgamated Order of Real Bearded Santas (A.O.R.B.S.), which was wrapped in scandal at the time. (""If you Google 'Santa Wars,' you'll find articles on it,"" Mr. Arnold said.) Today, F.O.R.B.S. is much smaller than I.B.R.B.S., which also includes Mrs. Clauses, and there are members of each group who will not forget the Santa tension of years past. Personal matters aside, Mr. Arnold said his resistance to take part in the government campaign revolved largely around a desire to remain apolitical. ""Most of our members were reluctant to consider being first in line because they felt that the whole thing on vaccines was being politically manipulated,"" he said. ""We work very hard on not being political. We do not allow any political posts or anything on our Facebook group pages."" ""If somebody posts something that's even slightly interpreted as a political statement, it's gone instantly,"" he continued. ""It's just deleted."" Should a member like to make a statement out-of-character, that's fine, Mr. Arnold said. ""We encourage all of our Santas who want to make political posts to create a separate page where they don't wear any red, and don't indicate they're Santa Claus or have Santa in their names,"" he said.

At this point, according to C.D.C. recommendations, Santa players shouldn't expect to be vaccinated before Christmas. So, what does that mean for this holiday season? ""Generally speaking, within the Santa community, we are being as cautious as possible,"" Mr. Arnold said. ""There's a small contingency of people who have laughed it off and said 'I'm going to go on normally, I won't be performing with a mask.'"" Most members of Santa organizations, however, are considered high-risk coronavirus candidates: They are retirees in their 70s and 80s and many have underlying health conditions, Mr. Erwin said. ""There isn't a group of people that are more compromised than the Christmas Committee,"" Mr. Arnold said. ""A lot of us are old and have diabetes. Most of us have a heart problem, most of us are obese. We check every box."" While many Santa-related innovations have come out of 2020 -- holiday-themed masks, plexiglass and acrylic walls that can be made to look invisible in photos, video calls, drive-through greetings -- Mr. Erwin is most enticed by the idea of placing Santa in a vinyl dome. The dome provides physical separation, but it can also be explained with a clever story for the children to understand, Mr. Erwin said. ""If parents don't want to explain virus transmission, they can say Santa got trapped in a snow globe by an elf magician and you have to come visit him at the globe,"" he said.

But Mr. Erwin won't be scheduling any in-person visits this year. His father-in-law suffered a stroke in April and was hospitalized for 30 days before he died; none of his family members were able to visit because of the pandemic. Mr. Erwin told his wife and his mother-in-law, who makes Santa costumes and goes by Mother Claus, that he would not take any chances with the virus. ""I don't even care about giving up my season,"" Mr. Erwin said. ""I'm thinking about the 150,000 plus people that did not have to die."" He blames the rising toll on the current administration and plans to deliver fitting gifts to its members this Christmas. ""As a Santa, I am neutral and love everybody, but as a citizen I have to say something,"" Mr. Erwin said, adding that he would not be giving politicians coal. ""They are getting dryer lint, at best.""","After a brush with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, professional Santa Clauses are just trying to get through this holiday season safely.",8a57a11b-b885-58ab-9db6-2cd9ee741f95,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/06/fashion/04SANTAS1/04SANTAS1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,"Ric Erwin is the chairman of the board of the Fraternal Order of Real Bearded Santas, a national association for Santa Claus performers.",8a57a11b-b885-58ab-9db6-2cd9ee741f95,N24News/imgs/8a57a11b-b885-58ab-9db6-2cd9ee741f95.jpg,15
Opinion,Mike Pence vs. the Coronavirus,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/opinion/letters/mike-pence-coronavirus.html,"Why should we be worried by President Trump's naming Vice President Mike Pence to coordinate the government's response to the coronavirus? Mr. Pence has an established and proven record in the scientific field.

Many of us remember that Mr. Pence wrote: ""Despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn't kill."" He is also a longtime climate change denier. And, of course, he has denigrated the theory of evolution while championing creationism.

As governor of Indiana, when H.I.V. started its rampage, Mr. Pence's proposed solution was to have those seeking assistance change their sexual behavior. He initially refused to open needle exchange programs to stop the spread of the virus. Instead, he said the most important thing we can do is ""pray.""

Mike Pence has succeeded already, because that is exactly what I am doing now. Not only for myself and my family but for my country.","A reader cites the vice president's response to previous health emergencies like AIDS, when he urged prayer.",267bad13-d597-5da1-82a7-c6aceac29c2b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/26/us/politics/26dc-virus-sub2/26dc-virus-sub2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=a90cf9c169731b6fc0b278b939b5ccbb3ab7849f4c6caf2352112f724092c6e1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,President Trump speaking to reporters about the coronavirus at the White House on Wednesday.,267bad13-d597-5da1-82a7-c6aceac29c2b,N24News/imgs/267bad13-d597-5da1-82a7-c6aceac29c2b.jpg,11
Books,"Picture Books About Kindness, Compassion and Peace in a Turbulent World",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/books/review/kindess-compassion-love-nikki-giovanni-i-am-loved.html,"In the last year my young daughters have asked, ""Did you know Trump grabs people's private parts?"" and ""Did someone shoot Ariana Grande?"" and ""What is porn?"" and ""How far away is North Korea?"" The year we just said farewell to was a bad one, whose passing certainly warrants four new picture books where love and fear meet in troubled times. I recently read the mighty Octavia Butler's ""Parable of the Sower,"" a dystopian road novel of survival published 13 years before Cormac McCarthy's ""The Road."" Butler leaves me trembling. In 1993 her clear vision of an American landscape where Los Angeles is burning, drugs are epidemic, racism rages and guns do the loudest talking was eerily prescient. Since my parenting now involves casual apocalypse prepping, I read Butler's novel as a how-to guide. I paid searingly close attention to the contents of the Go Bag, the emergency disaster pack, of Butler's 18-year-old narrator, Lauren. Spoiler alert: The dried fruit, extra shoes and water purification tablets all come in handy. But what most preserves Lauren on the bitter road is her mercy, compassion and love. So Butler was in my thoughts as I read these four magnificent new picture books. They are also how-tos: how to keep love present when fear is rampant, how to remember wonder and how to increase compassion in a flood of greed and danger. Matt de la Pena's simply titled ""Love"" collects life's small beauties -- laughter and waves, trains in the distance, the sound of a parent's voice, the soft music from the cabdriver's radio. But it does so from a sometimes deeply sad or scary place. The joy of grandparents, dancing and family gatherings are not layered on neutral ground, rather, ""Love"" is courageously set in moments of alarm, distress and heartache. From these depths, de la Pena, whose picture book ""Last Stop on Market Street"" was awarded a Newbery Medal, indicates the path to kindness and peace. ""On the night the fire alarm blares, you're pulled from sleep and whisked into the street, where a quiet old lady is pointing to the sky. 'Stars shine long after they flamed out,' she tells you, 'and the shine they shine with is love.'""

Loren Long's illustrations for ""Love,"" collaged and painted monoprints, corroborate a child's paradoxical, simultaneous confusion and clarity. A large family stands in the glow of the TV. Something horrific has happened, again. The adults are processing the bad event through the media and do not see that a child in pink pajamas has sneaked downstairs. ""But when you ask what has happened, they answer with silence and shift between you and the screen."" Here is fear, but here is also love. Elsewhere an older brother makes burned toast for his sibling while their father rides the early bus to work. In the toast's char, in the father's absence, we find love even in places that hurt. I am even more moved by these unseen acts of care -- char, breadwinning -- than all the flowers, laughing uncles and buskers de la Pena and Long (the Otis series, ""Little Tree"") also provide. Love that comes untested is perhaps not love strong enough for troubled times. This book looks into the darkness and still find stars twinkling overhead. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

""I Am Loved,"" a collection for children from the distinguished poet Nikki Giovanni, tackles, among other things, the idea of self-love and social justice. One poem asks us to look in the provided mirror and see all the bravery that came before, the hope, the sweat, the suffering that made us. ""And for that alone I am loved."" This ancestral pride is perfectly met in the book's illustrations, by the renowned Ashley Bryan, now 94 and still making indelible art. They are a world of exuberance and color, swirling portraits that show off a fluency with art drawn from multiple eras: 1960s psychedelia, Tibetan mandalas, American quilts, Madhubani paintings. Gorgeous. A clear favorite from Giovanni's collection is ""Do the Rosa Parks,"" a rhythm song both joyful and catchy. I heard my 7-year-olds singing it to one another days after we had read ""I Am Loved."" ""Do the Rosa Parks / throw your hands in the air ... Do the Rosa Parks / tell them that's not fair."" Playground empowerment gives me a lot of hope. ""Dear Girl"" is an epistolary picture book written by Amy Krouse Rosenthal, the author of many books including ""Friendshape"" and ""Uni the Unicorn,"" who died last year, and her daughter, Paris Rosenthal. Their book is a series of reminders I sorely wish we didn't still need. And yet. ""Dear Girl, Keep that arm raised! You have smart things to say!"" They also use the device of a mirror to discuss self-love. ""Thank you, birthmark! Thank you, red hair!"" ""Dear Girl"" mixes the joy of childhood -- ""Sometimes you just gotta stop and DANCE!"" -- with threads more troubling. ""Dear Girl, If your instinct is telling you to say no, say no, you know?"" Some may find a picture book that touches on consent disheartening, yet it seems abundantly necessary.

J. M. Barrie's epigraph to Oliver Jeffers's ""Here We Are: Notes for Living on Planet Earth"" says it best. ""Shall we make a new rule of life from tonight: Always try to be a little kinder than is necessary?"" Jeffers wrote this book as an address to his son. It's an explanation of our planet and a catalyst for curiosity to power responsibility. ""Make sure you look after it, as it's all we've got,"" Jeffers writes. ""Here We Are"" plumbs the depths of wonder. A glorious illustration of the magnitude of the Milky Way does not escape Jeffers's tongue-in-cheek humor: He adds, ""*Probably not to scale."" It is a tour through the land, the sea, the sky, our bodies: dioramas of our wild diversity. As fans of his book ""Stuck"" already know, he is the master of capturing the joy in our differences. Readers might lose themselves in these pages, cataloging the magnificence of the blue man in the red fez, the tiny beekeeper, the green haired punk, the whirling dervish, the baboon's bare butt, the quiet queen, the hammerhead, the unquiet chorister, the earthworm. How on Earth do purple trees exist? Jeffers paints an abundance of rich, dynamic purples: skies, bodies, cities and sundresses.

Real Estate,A SoHo Condo Designed by Renzo Piano,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/03/realestate/a-soho-condo-designed-by-renzo-piano.html,"Davide Bizzi consulted with many of his real estate colleagues in New York before deciding to buy a parcel on the western edge of SoHo, at the mouth of the Holland Tunnel, for a condominium development.

""In the beginning, I was afraid of the tunnel,"" said Mr. Bizzi, a global developer.

But many friends, including Howard M. Lorber, the chairman of Douglas Elliman Real Estate, talked to him about the changing downtown landscape. Neighborhoods that were once considered outer fringes of Manhattan, like Hudson Square to the west, were now bleeding into SoHo and TriBeCa, they agreed, and formerly distinct neighborhood borders were being blurred.

Even the Pritzker Prize-winning architect Renzo Piano, a friend who at the time was working on the new Whitney Museum of American Art, thought the location was good, Mr. Bizzi said. Although the building would overlook tunnel traffic that is often quite heavy, units that were high enough would have a clear view of the Hudson River, because it is unlikely that the low-level tunnel entrance would ever be built over.

""Renzo's philosophy is all about light, openness and transparency,"" Mr. Bizzi said. ""And that works well for this location because of the great views of the Hudson River.""","Renzo Piano's first residential project in the city, 565 Broome SoHo, overlooks Holland Tunnel traffic, but residents also get Hudson River views.",f56dc09e-6a5d-542e-867e-f27394682ba5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/03/realestate/03BROOME/03BROOME-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=e82fb058af930ac136172c9395f2503345f2abc947d48c2fcf53edaf0b3869a7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The 30-story 565 Broome SoHo on Varick Street will have 115 condominium units.,f56dc09e-6a5d-542e-867e-f27394682ba5,N24News/imgs/f56dc09e-6a5d-542e-867e-f27394682ba5.jpg,7
Food,Salad For Dinner,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/dining/salad-for-dinner-newsletter.html,"Good morning. Ginia Bellafante has a top-flight bit of sociology in The Times today, a story about the restaurant Freds, in the flagship Barneys store on Madison Avenue -- ""a restaurant in a department store rather than a department-store restaurant,"" Ginia wrote, ""which carries a meaningful distinction."" It is delicious.

As is, as it happens, the restaurant's roasted chicken salad (above), which has been for years the most popular item on the menu. You could pick up a rotisserie bird on the way home to make it this evening, if you like, with as many of the other ingredients tumbled into it as you can manage, and pretend you're eating on 61st Street, in advance of a showing of ""Lean on Pete"" at the Paris Theatre and a walk home afterward to your suite at the Carlyle.

No? Not your scene? (What, did you not like ""Metropolitan,"" either?) I like this roasted cauliflower salad with watercress, walnuts and Gruyere from Melissa Clark, just as much. (Here are 21 other vegetarian salads that are stand-alone meals.) I like it especially if I can have this rhubarb crisp for dessert or better yet, have leftover rhubarb crisp for breakfast in the morning, with a big dollop of plain yogurt.

You could make a frittata -- check out this frittata that is more vegetable than egg, from Mark Bittman. Or you could make Alison Roman's garlicky chicken thighs with scallion and lime, which delivers big, big flavors in way less than an hour. That's great.","Assemble a roasted chicken salad, or start the week with a frittata that is more vegetable than egg.",279cd88c-3fc3-5fa1-918a-150ee7f1f483,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/09/dining/09Freds2-copy/09Freds2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=3644608f469d91c744969af230dea3243a28449f94d67979b4075ce55bf214d5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The chicken salad at Freds has long been the restaurant's most popular dish.,279cd88c-3fc3-5fa1-918a-150ee7f1f483,N24News/imgs/279cd88c-3fc3-5fa1-918a-150ee7f1f483.jpg,17
Media,How a Justice Department Ruling Could Affect Your Favorite Musician,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/business/media/how-a-justice-department-ruling-could-affect-your-favorite-musician.html,"The Justice Department announced on Thursday that it had concluded a two-year investigation into the complex world of music licensing and decided against making changes to the regulatory agreements that govern Ascap and BMI, two large clearinghouses for performing rights that process about $2 billion in royalty payments each year. BMI quickly said it would challenge the decision in federal court, and Ascap said it would ""explore legislative solutions"" to the problems of music licensing in the digital age. Let's take a look at what happened and what it means. What are Ascap and BMI? The American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (Ascap) and Broadcast Music Inc. (BMI), known as performing rights organizations, collect money for songwriters and music publishers whenever their songs are publicly performed, whether on the radio, on television, in retail stores, bars, restaurants or on streaming services. Why is the government involved? Since Ascap and BMI are collectives that sell music rights at set prices, they have long been under antitrust scrutiny, and since 1941 they have been bound by regulatory agreements called consent decrees. Two years ago, both organizations asked the Justice Department to change these agreements, saying they needed to be updated to secure fair royalty rates in the digital era.

The Justice Department said it had decided not to make any changes to the consent decrees. But it added a requirement, saying that for Ascap and BMI to comply with the existing regulations, they must offer ""100 percent licensing"" of their songs. Many songs have multiple writers, and those writers don't always belong to the same rights society. According to the government's proposal, if a song has, say, three writers -- one affiliated with Ascap, one with BMI and the other with one of the smaller, unregulated groups like Sesac or Global Music Rights -- then for Ascap or BMI to offer that song to radio stations and digital services, it would need to have legal clearance to represent the song and be responsible for getting the writers their share of the royalties. Music industry groups say the proposed requirement would break with decades of practice, causing turmoil and possibly even violating private contracts. They argue that the performing rights organizations have long represented only the fractions of songs that they control, and that for a radio station or digital service to be properly licensed, it must have deals in place with the various groups representing any portion of a song. Musicians like Max Martin have said a government proposal on the licensing issue could interfere with their creative process. In a filing with the Justice Department, Ascap said the government's proposed rule could also cast doubt on whether it would actually be able to license as many as 370,000 of the more than 10 million songs in its catalog, which would cause headaches for any music outlets that wanted to play them. And musicians -- like Max Martin, who has written blockbuster hits for the likes of Taylor Swift and Britney Spears -- say it could interfere with their creative process, causing complications when they collaborate with a writer who is a member of a different rights organization.

Broadcasters and tech groups dispute this. In their view, offering entire works is the only way to have a fair marketplace and prevent the monopoly power that consent decrees were put in place to block.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions.
* $15 minimum wage for federal contractors will take effect Jan. 30. What about the money? Some executives and analysts in the music industry said the government's proposed changes would drive down the amount of money artists received because it would give an incentive to groups like broadcasters and streaming services to shop for the lowest royalty rates. Advocates for technology companies say that by helping keep costs down, this will lead to more consumer choice. Others say it is too soon to know how the ruling could affect things. Justice Department officials said they expect Ascap and BMI to compete to retain members, which should prevent rates from dropping. One area in which the effect of the new ruling is unclear is unregulated competitors like Global Music Rights, started three years ago by the music executive Irving Azoff. It represents top writers like Pharrell Williams, Bruno Mars and members of the Eagles. On one hand, carrying out the ""100 percent licensing"" rule would seemingly undermine that company's leverage to demand higher rates for any songs that were co-written with a member of Ascap or BMI. But music executives also say that the model of Global Music Rights and Sesac may now become more attractive for top writers who are unhappy with the new rules for Ascap and BMI. What happens now? The Justice Department is giving the music industry a year to comply with its new requirements. It is unclear how this would happen, but industry executives say it could include the creation of new databases to share data that previously was proprietary. Mike O'Neill, the chief executive of BMI, said in a statement announcing the group's legal challenge that the government's decision ""serves no one, not the marketplace, the music publishers, the music users and most importantly, not our songwriters and composers who now have the government weighing in on their creative and financial decisions."" But the challenge may be difficult because the judges who monitor Ascap and BMI have made tough rulings in recent years. Another possibility is that major publishers like Universal and Sony/ATV could withdraw completely from Ascap and BMI, moves that would severely weaken those groups and add yet more uncertainty in the world of music licensing. For the music companies and the outlets that need music, that is an outcome they would prefer to avoid.","The department, after a two-year investigation, decided to keep the complex regulatory environment of music licensing largely intact, with the addition of a rule requiring ""100 percent"" deals. This breaks down what that means.",04d1a5b3-98f1-5c8c-894e-139cd5e386fe,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/04/business/media/05MUSIC/05MUSIC-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=9acc2deccf6590719bce60112b9c8cff0d7f9d7f8d03e46061acfbfc031c948d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Taylor Swift performing at the Grammy Awards in February.

Automobiles,If Your Chauffeur Needs a Snowplow,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/automobiles/autoreviews/if-your-chauffeur-needs-a-snowplow.html,"DETROIT -- It started with a few innocent flakes. (Doesn't it always?) And then a snowstorm barreled into town the night after Christmas, frosting rows of parked cars and smothering the Walter P. Reuther Freeway, an unofficial autobahn where traffic tends to stream at 80 to 85 miles per hour. But not tonight. Confidence plummeted in direct proportion to the snowfall. Drivers picked their way along the freeway's eerie, white-glowing moonscape like nervous skiers on a powder run. At this moment, I'm glad to be driving the latest Bentley Flying Spur, a 2.5-ton holiday goose from England. With a serious all-wheel-drive system, 21-inch wheels and claw-gripping winter tires, the Spur becomes an unstoppable monster in the snow: a 616-horsepower Zamboni that could probably clear a rink and glide around the boards at 120 m.p.h. The Bentley also makes a grand holiday entrance, though if my family was expecting me to hand out Rolexes, they were disappointed. The best I could do was to point to the analog Breitling clock in the Bentley, whose interior is suitable for some Wall Street wolf. There is Chippendale-worthy burr walnut, chrome brightwork and hand-stitched leather from cool-climate herds unmolested by insect bites and blemishes. Such overkill is the point of a Bentley, even for the Chinese nouveau riche who line up for the Spur but may never take the wheel, hiring a chauffeur instead.

Those back-seat one-percenters -- or maybe .00001 percenters in China -- can have their folding wood picnic tables, champagne chillers and remote-controlled rear entertainment system. (The $2,135 bottle cooler and $7,300 entertainment system were missing from my Spur, even though the base price is $205,825 and the test car totaled $238,180.) But piloting the Flying Spur is better than riding in the back. It clocks miles so effortlessly that for my trip to Detroit I was happy to trade being groped by a T.S.A. agent -- and a sardine seat in coach class -- for the Bentley's upper-class accommodations. I knocked out 630 miles from New York to Detroit in nine hours flat, wafted by a twin-turbo 6-liter W12 engine with 590 pound-feet of torque. Compared with Rolls-Royce, the main rival for the vault keys of the rich, Bentley puts more heft in the steering and more starch in its adaptive suspension. That air suspension is just one technology that has trickled up from Volkswagen and Audi since the VW Group bought Bentley in 1999 and built it into the world's best-selling brand of ultraluxury cars. After enduring a huge dip during the recession, Bentley is going gangbusters again; its global sales last year of more than 10,000 cars represented a 19 percent gain over 2012.

Bentley's explosive revival began in 2003 with the Continental GT Coupe, the boat-tailed showstopper that became a must-have for ballers and brokers, both old money and new. The Continental Flying Spur followed in 2006. That 12-cylinder sedan drove fine, but its appearance was limousine-generic. The reworked Flying Spur drops Continental from its name, and the design allies itself more closely with Bentley's flagship, the $280,000 Mulsanne. Using the nearly foot-longer Mulsanne as a template, the Spur's body builds stronger shoulders and adds formal body creases -- superheated aluminum is molded by air pressure into complex shapes -- to display its Bentley heritage. Wide-eyed outer headlamps bookend a smaller inner pair. A full-length lower fascia plays up the car's wider stance. New vents behind the front wheels flash a ""flying B"" motif. The rear roof pillars dip into a lower rear end with broad, Mulsanne-style haunches. Horizontal taillamps house LED ""light pipes"" in the brand's signature elliptical shape. Aside from its oversize mesh grille, the exterior remains understated, saving the spectacle for the cabin. Bentley claims more than 600 new parts inside. Even the headliner is wrapped in cowhide, with a choice of 17 colors. Bentley also offers seven wood veneers, each requiring about 10 square meters of mirror-polished timber.

My Spur test car featured the optional Mulliner Spec package ($10,930), whose goodies include 21-inch alloy wheels, diamond-quilted leather upholstery, a knurled-metal sport shifter, Bentley wings embroidered on the headrests and a metal fuel cap that could double as a paperweight. A $615 wood-and-metal eyeglass case, too precious for drugstore sunglasses, plugs into the center cup holders. More money is burned with cigar lighters and ashtrays ($440); a two-tone, hide-trimmed steering wheel ($2,335); contrasting leather seat piping ($2,335); and a crystalline 1,100-watt Naim audio system ($7,480). In that indulgent vein, the trick for brands like Bentley is to convince people that design, exclusivity and elvish levels of craftsmanship justify paying double the price -- or more -- of cars that offer comparable performance and sometimes superior technology. One easy example is the Bentley's poorer cousin, the Audi A8. The Flying Spur rides on a modified version of the chassis that underpins the A8, which costs roughly $90,000. For $112,000, the S8 version of the Audi has a 520-horsepower V8 and accelerates faster than the Bentley (3.9 seconds from 0 to 60 miles per hour, versus 4.3 seconds for the Spur, according to the manufacturers). One element of these price disparities might be explained by any hotel valet: One car is an Audi, but the other is a Bentley. And while Bentley continues to rely on ""the help"" at Audi for technology, Audi still keeps the newest gizmos for itself, bestowing hand-me-downs when it's good and ready. Bentley is again denied the latest, greatest version of Audi's Multi Media Interface and navigation system. The Flying Spur's screen graphics, processing speed, menus and controls are middling, though they're significantly better than the VW-based, abacus-level system that Bentley once foisted on its customers.

Bentley does impress with its optional rear entertainment and connectivity system. Aside from dual 10-inch screens and DVD players, a Wi-Fi connection streams media or links devices from iPads to laptops. There's even a USB charger onboard. Bentley has soothed the Spur's once-crusty ride by softening the springs, bushings and antiroll bars, and by adding standard 19-inch tires with taller sidewalls. Yet the stiffened chassis and adaptive suspension still conjure Bentley magic, allowing the Spur to handle with remarkable poise at a ridiculous pace. Bentley says the Spur has shed 120 pounds, yet the beast still weighs 5,451 pounds when empty, more than the current Range Rover. Even lugging that mass, the Spur's 14 percent increase in power-to-weight ratio allows a claimed top speed of 200 m.p.h. Smarter electronic controls for this Frankenstein engine -- essentially two Volkswagen V6 engines bolted into a W configuration -- and a new 8-speed ZF automatic transmission bolster the Spur's aura of invincibility. To reduce drag and increase stability, the body lowers automatically at 121 m.p.h., then drops further at 149 m.p.h. Driving in such magisterial fashion takes a toll on mileage. The Spur's federal economy rating has risen by 1 m.p.g. in both city and highway use, to 12/20 m.p.g., but that remains low enough to warrant a $2,600 gas-guzzler tax. In 1,600 miles of driving, I was forced to make one unscheduled stop. In Detroit one evening, the bitter cold confused the tire-pressure monitor, which insisted that all four tires had gone low simultaneously -- and then refused to let me shut off the screen's alert message to access other data. I pulled into a station with a bog-slow air pump and crouched with the hose as my hands went numb. A family in a Jeep Grand Cherokee awaited their turn, clearly entertained by the sight of a Bentley driver getting his hands dirty. Perhaps the Bentley buyers in China are onto something: That's what chauffeurs are for.","With a serious all-wheel-drive system, 21-inch wheels and winter tires, the Bentley Flying Spur is an unstoppable monster in the snow: a 616-horsepower Zamboni that could glide around the boards at 120 m.p.h.",8bafd513-4c1e-546c-97da-1e1dab6d0d28,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/23/automobiles/WHEEL1/WHEEL1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=412&w=600&s=6135c164cc3fe26615ee0f6f1afdb3a842d15a66cb962bcddffa8080316a6079&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"The new Flying Spur has broad haunches like Bentley's Mulsanne flagship.

Food,New Essex Street Market Opens in an Enormous New Space,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html,"It has been known, for years, that the original Essex Market, founded in 1940, one of several city markets established by Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia, would have to shut its doors, giving way to more lucrative use of its real estate. Its much larger replacement has opened across Delancey Street in a vast new multifaceted development called Essex Crossing. Run by the New York City Economic Development Corporation, the market covers 37,000 square feet, triple the original's size, and has added 16 new vendors to the old market's 21, along with two restaurant spaces and a demonstration kitchen. Shoppers can stock up on ingredients from grocers, fishmongers, cheese purveyors, butchers and others. They can also sample Middle Eastern specialties from Samesa; seafood from Don Ceviche; Moroccan fare by Zerza; meat from Essex Shambles; Thai chicken and rice from Eat Gai; and sweets by Lower East Side Ice Cream Factory and Josephine's Feast, all new to the market. Later this year, Roni Mazumdar, an owner of the Indian restaurants Adda and Rahi, will open Dhamaka, a full-service restaurant serving regional Indian cuisine. A huge lower-level market, not just for food, called Market Line is also set to open at Essex Crossing in late summer.

The name means grandmother in the dialect of Modena, Italy, where the chef and partner, Stefano Secchi , worked at the highly rated Osteria Francescana . The focus of his restaurant will be traditional handmade pastas reflecting the region of Emilia-Romagna , where the chef cooked. Shapes like tagliatelle, strozzapreti and tortelloni will be dressed with classic ragus and tomato sauces. Some also feature vegetables, like a dish of cappelletti verdi stuffed with leeks and served with black mushrooms. Main courses include rabbit, veal cheeks and grilled dry-aged steaks. The room is rustic, with a brick wall and tile accents.

A five-course tasting menu will be available for $12 4 at this 18-seat addition to the West Eighth Street restaurant lineup. The chef and an owner, Franco Sampogna, had a significant career cooking in France with Alain Ducasse and Guy Savoy. His menu features dishes like green asparagus with pistachios and coconut, ravioli with calamari, halibut with fennel, and Wagyu beef with potatoes and onions. He uses the picanha cut of the beef, part of the sirloin, and a favorite in his native Brazil. Bernardo Silva, his partner in this venture, will run the restaurant, which is reached through an art gallery. The chef de cuisine, Pierre Magnolini, also worked for Mr. Ducasse. (Thursday)

Semi Feyzioglu is turning the spacious 150-seat room that was Isabella's into an Eastern Mediterranean and Turkish spot. The name is a reference to its location beyond Istanbul, a city built, like Jerusalem, Lisbon and Rome, on seven hills. Mr. Feyzioglu, whose family is in the restaurant business in Istanbul, has installed a shiny bar in the center of the room with tables around and seats on a mezzanine above it. The place has something of a midcentury modern look. The chef, Yilmaz Ucar, is from Istanbul.","Handmade pastas from a Osteria Francescana chef, a five-course tasting menu in the West Village and more restaurant news.",a306bffa-ade1-57e7-ac2f-1016f1c8d069,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/15/dining/14off/merlin_154675710_1258d6cb-0fc8-4a06-9a20-b92f5d5b0c32-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=0a736c3f10f62fa20773e5945d4680703b1d7630d164248893723f80565aa097&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Essex Market at Essex Crossing covers 37,000 square feet, triple the size of the original.",a306bffa-ade1-57e7-ac2f-1016f1c8d069,N24News/imgs/a306bffa-ade1-57e7-ac2f-1016f1c8d069.jpg,17
Media,The Intercept Promised to Reveal Everything. Then Its Own Scandal Hit.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/13/business/media/the-intercept-source-reality-winner.html,"Internal documents show how a source ended up in jail -- and the fallout in the newsroom.

Where were you when you first heard about the Snowden leak? The huge breach of the National Security Agency's domestic surveillance program in June 2013 was one of the proudest moments in modern journalism, and one of the purest: A brave and disgusted whistle-blower, Edward Snowden, revealed the government's extensive surveillance of American and foreign citizens. Two journalists protected their source, revealed his secrets and won the blessings of the Establishment -- a Pulitzer Prize and an Oscar for it. One of the people who fell in love with that story was Pierre Omidyar, the earnest if remote billionaire founder of eBay. That October, he pledged $250 million for a new institution led by those two journalists, Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras. Mr. Omidyar was the benefactor of journalists' dreams. He promised total independence for a new nonprofit news site, The Intercept, under the umbrella of his First Look Media. The Intercept was founded in the belief that ""the prime value of journalism is that it imposes transparency, and thus accountability, on those who wield the greatest governmental and corporate power."" The outlet's first mission was to set up a secure archive of Mr. Snowden's documents, and to keep mining them for stories. The recent history of the news business has been about what happens when your traditional business is disrupted by the internet and your revenues dry up. But at The Intercept and First Look, the story is of a different destabilizing force: gushers of money. In 2017, the for-profit arm of the company had budgeted $40 million for a growing staff and bets on movies and television shows, a former executive said, while the nonprofit arm spent about $26 million in 2017 and again in 2018 according to its public filings, most of it on The Intercept.

High-profile stars collected big salaries -- Mr. Greenwald brought in more than $500,000 in 2015 -- and they sometimes clashed in public with their titular bosses over the rocky efforts to build an organization. Writers warred on Twitter and in Slack messages over Donald Trump, race and the politics of the left. Mr. Greenwald continues to infuriate younger colleagues with tweets like one denouncing ""woke ideologues."" Not long after Mr. Omidyar wired his first dollar, he found himself presiding over chaos so public that Vanity Fair asked in 2015 ""whether First Look Media can make headlines that aren't about itself?"" All the drama would make this another colorful story about extreme newsroom dysfunction had The Intercept not caught the attention of a naive National Security Agency linguist with the improbable name of Reality Winner in 2017. Ms. Winner, then 25, had been listening to the site's podcast. She printed out a secret report on Russian cyberattacks on American voting software that seemed to address some of Mr. Greenwald's doubts about Russian interference in the 2016 campaign and mailed it to The Intercept's Washington, D.C., post office box in early May. The Intercept scrambled to publish a story on the report, ignoring the most basic security precautions. The lead reporter on the story sent a copy of the document, which contained a crease showing it had been printed out, to the N.S.A. media affairs office, all but identifying Ms. Winner as the leaker.

""They sold her out, and they messed it up so that she would get caught, and they didn't protect their source,"" her mother, Billie Winner-Davis, said in a telephone interview last week. ""The best years of her life are being spent in a system where she doesn't belong."" Failing to protect an anonymous leaker is a cardinal sin in journalism, though the remarkable thing in this instance is that The Intercept didn't seem to try to protect its source. The outlet immediately opened an investigation into its blunder, which confirmed the details that the Justice Department had gleefully announced after it arrested Ms. Winner. They included the fact that The Intercept led the authorities to Ms. Winner when it circulated the document in an effort to verify it, and then published the document, complete with the identifying markings, on the internet. Internal emails and records I obtained reveal the tumult that led to one of the highest-profile journalistic disasters in recent memory and provide broader insights into the limits of a news organization dependent on an inattentive billionaire's noblesse oblige. A spokeswoman for Mr. Omidyar declined to make him available for an interview. The New York Times is not publishing the documents, which run to more than 100 pages, because they include discussions of sourcing and security measures. The documents, among them two internal reports on the Reality Winner incident that have not been made public, were given to me by people who were senior employees in 2017 and contend that the organization failed to hold itself accountable for its mistakes and for what happened to Ms. Winner as a result. Some current and former staff members I interviewed expressed fundamental questions about the internal investigation into the debacle, including why Betsy Reed, the editor in chief, had assigned Lynn Dombek, then The Intercept's head of research, who reported directly to her, to work on the investigation, under the direction of an outside law firm. Ms. Reed, who had been brought in to stabilize The Intercept and rein in its big personalities in 2015, told me she faced ""a treacherous situation"" after the article was published. She needed to balance a ""legitimate demand for transparency"" that aligned with The Intercept's founding values with lawyers' strong advice to stay silent to protect her reporters and their sources.

Ms. Poitras said The Intercept should have held itself to a higher standard. ""We founded this organization on the principle of holding the powerful accountable and protecting whistle-blowers,"" Ms. Poitras said in an interview. ""Not only was this a cover-up and betrayal of core values, but the lack of any meaningful accountability promoted a culture of impunity and puts future sources at risk."" The internal tensions were boiling over one night, just before Thanksgiving 2017, when the two American journalists who helped bring Mr. Snowden's revelations public were exchanging late-night emails, which I obtained. They were writing not about government misconduct, but their own newsroom's. Ms. Reed's oversight of the investigation, Ms. Poitras wrote, was an attempt ""to cover up what happened for self-protective reasons."" It was, Mr. Greenwald agreed in response, a ""whitewash."" The documents fall short of revealing a conspiratorial cover-up. Instead they show an extreme version of the human errors, hubris and mismanagement familiar to anyone who has worked in a newsroom -- and the struggle of The Intercept to live up to its lofty founding ideals in dealing with its own errors. Ms. Winner may have thought she was mailing the documents to Mr. Greenwald and Ms. Poitras, who went to great lengths to protect Mr. Snowden. But Mr. Greenwald was in Brazil and when he heard about the document, he was not interested. He told me that he considered its claims about Russian hacking during the 2016 race ""wildly overblown"" and that it didn't include direct evidence to persuade him otherwise. Ms. Poitras, meanwhile, had at that point left The Intercept, and gone on to establish a nonprofit production firm, Field of Vision, a part of First Look Media, which also includes The Intercept and Mr. Omidyar's other ventures.

Ms. Reed and her deputy, Roger Hodge, gave the story to a pair of established television journalists: Matthew Cole and Richard Esposito. Mr. Cole, formerly of NBC, had collaborated with Mr. Greenwald on the Snowden stories and was on staff. Mr. Esposito, also a veteran of broadcast news at NBC News and ABC News, was brought in from outside and is now the top spokesman for the New York Police Department. Ms. Reed told me she'd brought them in partly because The Intercept's outsider posture had left it without the inside sources who could verify documents like Ms. Winner's. But their reflex to reach out to national security officials carried its own risk.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""If you get a document that purports to be from the N.S.A., it should be a five-alarm fire,"" a member of The Intercept's high-powered security team, Erinn Clark, said in her interview for the internal inquiry. ""Go to a secure room, with an editor, freeze where you are. You are not aware who you are exposing or putting at risk."" Instead, Mr. Cole put the document in his bag and got on a train to New York. One concern did cross his mind. ""I thought at the time there would be an audit if they printed on a government printer,"" he said, according to the internal review notes. ""I forgot about that thought."" Later, he called a source in the intelligence community in an attempt to verify the document, and casually revealed its postmark. ""My source said something about, 'How did it come to us?' I said in the mail, from Georgia, and my source laughed about that,"" he recalled during the internal investigation. Then, Mr. Cole mentioned that the postmark was Fort Gordon, Ga., which is home to the N.S.A.'s Cryptologic Center. ""'There's a logic to that,' the source said.""

The startling carelessness about protecting Ms. Winner was particularly mystifying at an organization that had been founded on security. The Intercept had hired leaders in digital security, Ms. Clark and Micah Lee, for just such situations. Mr. Cole did not involve them at all. Mr. Cole and Mr. Esposito said they'd been pushed to rush the story to publication, but Mr. Cole also acknowledged that failing to consult with the security team was a ""face plant."" The Intercept's leaders argued in 2017, and still contend, that the narrative laid out by the Justice Department in its prosecution of Ms. Winner was shaped to make The Intercept -- a thorn in the government's side -- look bad. And Ms. Winner's own carelessness -- she printed the document at work -- could easily have gotten her caught even if The Intercept had been more cautious. But they also knew they had made real journalistic errors. And so a key question was who to blame for this catastrophe and what consequences they should suffer. Ms. Dombek, who helped conduct the internal investigation, concluded that the editors -- Ms. Reed and Mr. Hodge -- needed to take responsibility. Others, including Mr. Greenwald, were demanding that Mr. Cole and Ms. Reed be fired, and The Intercept provide a public reckoning. (Mr. Greenwald later relented, and said he understood the desire not to ""scapegoat"" for an institutional failure.) On July 11, 2017, Ms. Reed published a post on The Intercept announcing that First Look would pay for Ms. Winner's legal defense. Ms. Reed also announced that an ""internal review of the reporting of this story has now been completed."" ""We should have taken greater precautions to protect the identity of a source who was anonymous even to us,"" she wrote. ""As the editor in chief, I take responsibility for this failure, and for making sure that the internal newsroom issues that contributed to it are resolved."" But the drama didn't end there. Mr. Greenwald and Jeremy Scahill, an investigative reporter who is the third founder of The Intercept, demanded a more thorough investigation, and in response to their pressure, the company commissioned a second internal report, by a First Look lawyer, David Bralow. Mr. Bralow's report, issued four months later, cited as central issues the decision to share the document with the N.S.A., Mr. Cole's discussion of the postmark and the publication of the identifying markings.

The Intercept never fully regained its swagger after the Reality Winner case, though it has continued to produce notable stories. It has broadened its original mandate to reporting on ""civil liberties, social justice, the fight against corruption,"" Ms. Reed said, and broken stories including revelations from the Snowden files of AT&T's role in N.S.A. surveillance and an investigative profile by Mr. Cole of Erik Prince, the founder of the private security contractor Blackwater. Nowadays, it seems more taken by politics, both in Brazil, where Mr. Greenwald lives, and in the United States, where it has become a hub for the fiery ideological battles playing out among the American left. A leak to Mr. Greenwald last year showed how corruption investigations had been politicized in Brazil; the reporting reshaped the country's politics. In the United States, Mr. Greenwald has been increasingly engaged in the bitter feuds with others on the left, charging that liberals -- including some of his Intercept colleagues -- have become fixated on identity politics and Russia, and ignored the more insidious workings of corporate power. His most memorable television appearances these days seem to be on Fox's Tucker Carlson show, during which the two men denounce the so-called ""deep state."" Meanwhile, his colleagues have refashioned the site to champion insurgents and critics of the Democratic mainstream, including a woman who accused Joe Biden of sexual assault, Tara Reade, as mainstream outlets raised doubts about her story.",Internal documents show how a source ended up in jail — and the fallout in the newsroom.,26ecaee5-90c3-582e-baf4-74494221ae41,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/14/business/13JPBenSmith1-print/13JPBenSmith1-print-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=698105c9cf82d36260c33acd99e977781a3ce2fa353463476b2fb731f3e97d3e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Pierre Omidyar, the billionaire founder of eBay, was the benefactor of journalists' dreams.",26ecaee5-90c3-582e-baf4-74494221ae41,N24News/imgs/26ecaee5-90c3-582e-baf4-74494221ae41.jpg,16
Art & Design,"The National Portrait Gallery Lost Visitors, Though Not as Many as Feared",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/arts/design/national-portrait-gallery-london-miscount.html,"Art institutions in Britain have faced declining attendance in recent years, and museum officials met last year to discuss the issue. But when a steep drop-off in visitors to the National Portrait Gallery in London was included in its report to Parliament in July, people were alarmed: It was a decrease of more than 40 percent.

It turns out it was the result of a counting error by Ipsos Retail Performance, the company that tracks visitors to the museum and other establishments.

The number of visitors in the 2017-18 fiscal year, which ended April 1, had been falsely reported as having dropped to about 1.1 million, from about 1.9 million. The real number of visitors for 2017-18 was nearly 1.7 million, the museum said Wednesday. 



That represented a drop of about 10 percent from the previous year, not the more alarming decline based on the false information.

How Science and Public Health Gave Children a Future

By Perri Klass



""A Good Time to Be Born"" is an ambitious, elegant meditation on what the doctor-writer Perri Klass describes as one of our greatest human achievements: a reduction in child mortality. She begins by reminding us that ""we are the luckiest parents in history""; for the first time in human memory, early death of children is now the exception, not the norm. Klass goes on to explore the toll taken in previous eras by measles, tuberculosis, diarrhea and other, now preventable, illnesses -- and also the art that grew from such pain. She describes how scientific advances that led to the reduction of child mortality have shaped culture, transforming parenting, medicine and the way we live now.

The book is divided into three sections: ""The Desolation of That Empty Cradle,"" ""The Birth of a Great and New Idea"" and ""What Marvelous Days"" (from a 1902 speech by Mary Putnam Jacobi, a champion of women's health, describing the birth of her first child). Chapters are punctuated with nursery rhymes, paintings, newspaper clippings, letters and photographs -- all shining a light on advances in clinical medicine and science alongside the meaning of childhood. Klass also examines ""Peter Pan,"" ""Jane Eyre,"" ""Little Women"" and ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" through this lens.

The politics of health care are another undercurrent throughout ""A Good Time to Be Born."" Klass describes inequality and racism with a quiet, powerful rage that underscores the shameful political truths that continue during our contemporary plague: ""As we have watched the Covid-19 pandemic sweep the world, we have learned again the hard lesson that this new virus, like old infections, does more damage among the poor, among minorities, among immigrants and refugees, among people who are kept on the margins."" She reminds us that ""racism continues to blight the health and growth of children in many different ways,"" and then highlights continued disparities in medicine.

In the acknowledgments of this book is an almost apologetic disclaimer that Klass does not consider herself a historian or expert in any sense -- yet she clearly is an expert in narrative and in medicine. In ""A Good Time to Be Born,"" she takes the most complex human patterns of all -- history, medicine, politics, art -- and knits them into something unique and beautiful.","In her new book about child mortality, Perri Klass explores the science.",8f17bafe-c758-574d-ad1c-dd86e0984a2c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/13/books/review/13Watson/13Watson-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=9c257c95ac4407b40e4614fff08ee5f03d3b8214398e8a47a992d3ecd07a1fc2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A nutritionist weighs a child.,8f17bafe-c758-574d-ad1c-dd86e0984a2c,N24News/imgs/8f17bafe-c758-574d-ad1c-dd86e0984a2c.jpg,13
Television,"'Westworld' Season 3 Is Here. Wait, What Happened in Season 2?",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/arts/television/westworld-season-2-recap.html,"It has been about a year and a half since the second season of ""Westworld"" ended with ""The Passenger,"" a feature-length episode so loaded with timelines and twists that even explainer articles became their own Russian nesting dolls. Had the third season begun the next day, many of us would be scrambling desperately to sort through all the host-human hybrids, the smuggled control units and the three or four different terms for the virtual Eden where android souls are uploaded. ""Westworld"" has the power to turn the human brain into the ultimate corrupted server. So let's start with a basic reassurance about the new season, which debuts Sunday on HBO: You're going to be OK. The action has shifted from Westworld to the real world, where Dolores Abernathy (Evan Rachel Wood) can continue her quest for revenge on the humans responsible for making her life -- and the lives of the other hosts -- an ever-looping hell of violation and death. Her path to this point was wayward to the extreme, but her mission hasn't wavered in the least. In the great robot rebellion, she has always been the tip of the spear.

All season long, the characters were making their way toward a mythical place on the horizon. Dolores said that the Valley Beyond was a ""weapon"" she would turn against the humans, which was partly true (see below), and the Ghost Nation leader Akecheta (Zahn McClarnon) envisioned a doorway into another world, which is a little bit closer. In truth, it is a virtual paradise created for the hosts by Robert Ford (Anthony Hopkins), where they can all live free and peacefully away from their human tormentors -- a kind of giant server into which their conscious minds were uploaded. The virtual doorway lay at the edge of a cliff; the moment a host passed into the Valley Beyond, its mind separated from its body, which then dropped lifeless into an actual valley beyond. The good news for narrative purposes is that these hosts are not ""Westworld"" dead, but dead-dead. (R.I.P. Akecheta.) And Dolores secured their everlasting bliss by beaming this Eden to a satellite that apparently no human can access. The Cradle and the Forge

The second season introduced two massive server farms. The Cradle, located in the Mesa Hub, where the park's technicians do their work, stored all the relevant backup data for the hosts and the park environments. It was to Westworld what an external hard drive or the Cloud might be to a computer. The host Angela (Talulah Riley), once a submissive greeter to guests at the park, blew it up in a suicide bombing. That means freedom for the hosts, but also mortality. The Forge was like the Cradle but for human information. (Its servers also contained the Valley Beyond before Dolores beamed it and its inhabitants elsewhere.) One big revelation from Season 2 was that the true value of the park for the Delos Corporation was in mining data from the guests. Using those ten-gallon hats, Delos collected information and stored it in the Forge with the aim of copying human minds into host bodies, which, if successful, could effectively make those people immortal.

James Delos (Peter Mullan), the company's founder, was the original lab rat for this experiment, but perfection was elusive: At some point, each new iteration of Robot James would reach a ""cognitive plateau"" and break down. But that didn't mean the end of the idea -- there's a lot of business potential in immortality. The relationship between Dolores and her fellow host Bernard Lowe (Jeffrey Wright) is adversarial in many respects -- expect the two to clash in Season 3. But Bernard quietly programmed the Forge to be a database where Dolores could consume the guest data in a virtual library. (Remember this when Dolores makes reference to a book early in the Season 3 premiere.) He also ""killed"" Dolores in the Forge and later took out her control unit, or ""pearl,"" in order to place it in the body of another host. Much like the Cradle, the Forge is wiped out, this time by a flood. (A reminder to keep your electronics away from water.)

In the season's biggest twist, Bernard created a hybrid by placing Dolores's pearl inside a copy of Charlotte Hale's body. The executive director of the Delos board, Charlotte (Tessa Thompson) had been the chief ""Westworld"" villain, leading her security team in putting down the host rebellion and securing the company's intellectual property. After the Charlotte-Dolores hybrid (""Halores,"" let's call her) gunned down the real Charlotte, it not only allowed Dolores to smuggle herself onto a rescue boat to the human world, it also ensured that a perfect copy of Charlotte's body would be available to occupy the seat of power at Delos, where she could make consequential decisions that might not be beneficial to mankind. The only chance to stop Halores was a scanner that would identify her as a host, but in another twist, the security chief holding the scanner, Ashley Stubbs (Luke Hemsworth), revealed that he was a host himself. And so she was off to the mainland, clutching a purse full of pearls.

There were five pearls in Halores's purse. One of them was Bernard, which we know because the Season 2 finale jumped ahead to a scene in which we see him and Dolores in a safe house provided by Ford, complete with a 3-D host printer. Which also means that Dolores (as Halores) printed a new body for herself as well. But the Hale host-body wasn't discarded; it showed up at the safe house, too, which means that one of those other four pearls wound up inside of her. The other four could be any host that didn't walk into the Valley Beyond. Among those who didn't make it: the sharpshooting Sweetwater bandit Armistice (Ingrid Bolso Berdal); the bandit leader Hector Escaton (Rodrigo Santoro); and Maeve (Thandie Newton), the hugely powerful host who spent the second season searching for her daughter. When Maeve's body was left in the hands of two sympathetic technicians, Sylvester (Ptolemy Slocum) and Lutz (Leonardo Nam), her revival became a near certainty.","It's been a while since the last season finale, and the details were a little fuzzy the first time around. Here's some help before the start of Season 3.",c34c7f27-c6cb-59e7-9042-52e964d4b1bc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/13/arts/13westworld-walkup/13westworld-walkup-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=0f2d591222621393f5a6d669333f97721bec881ac5937aa13bcb32163f17400b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Bernard (Jeffrey Wright) looks disoriented; he isn't alone.

Health,More Men With Early Prostate Cancer Are Choosing to Avoid Treatment,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/25/health/prostate-cancer-active-surveillance-surgery-radiation.html,"Seemingly overnight, treatment of men with early-stage prostate cancer has undergone a sea change. Five years ago, nearly all opted for surgery or radiation; now, nearly half are choosing no treatment at all. The approach is called active surveillance. It means their cancers are left alone but regularly monitored to be sure they are not growing. Just 10 percent to 15 percent of early-stage prostate cancer patients were being treated by active surveillance several years ago. Now, national data from three independent sources consistently finds that 40 percent to 50 percent of them are making that choice. In recent years, major research organizations have begun to recommend active surveillance, which for years had been promoted mostly by academic urologists in major medical centers, but not by urologists in private practice, who treat most men. In 2011, the National Institutes of Health held a consensus conference that concluded that it should be the preferred course for men with small and innocuous-looking tumors. Last year, the American Society of Clinical Oncology issued guidelines with the same advice. The data includes a large new national registry established by the American Urological Association involving 15,000 men nearly all treated by urologists in private practice through 2015; a national registry of 45 mostly private urology practices; and a Michigan registry of mostly private urology practices. In addition, preliminary 2016 data from the urology association indicates that the numbers are growing, with even more than 50 percent of patients choosing active surveillance.

""Things are changing very, very quickly,"" said Dr. Matthew R. Cooperberg, a urologist and epidemiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who has been helping collect data for the new American Urological Association database. Half of all men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer have low-risk tumors, which pathologists, using a scoring system that looks at the appearance of cells under a microscope, rate as Gleason 6 or less on a commonly used scale. Their risk of dying from prostate cancer in the next 10 years is less than 1 percent, whether they have aggressive treatment or whether they choose active surveillance, research shows. Nothing, though, is straightforward in the cancer world. Is everyone with a cancer scored as Gleason 6 or lower a candidate for active surveillance? It is not clear. It is an easier decision for older men with a life expectancy of 10 to 15 years because most prostate cancers that grow do so very slowly. But what about men in their 50s or early 60s?

That leads to a dilemma for younger men, said Dr. Jonathan I. Epstein, a pathologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital. They have a longer life expectancy during which their tumor might grow and become more aggressive. Yet, he said, ""it is the young men who really want to avoid radical treatment for their cancer as the complications, such as impotence and incontinence, affect them to a much greater degree."" Dr. William Catalona, a professor of urology at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said he worried that some younger men may find out too late that their cancer has become incurable. Active surveillance, he warned, ""is a tragic mistake for some."" Yet some doctors are beginning to question whether these tumors should even be called cancers. Dr. Cooperberg argues that the lowest-risk tumors need a name that conveys their languorous growth and generally benign nature. ""There has to be some terminology that doesn't say it's normal but doesn't use the C-word,"" he said. Others, like Dr. Justin E. Bekelman, an associate professor of radiation oncology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, are not ready to drop the word ""cancer."" ""They have an excellent prognosis, but it is still cancer and we have to follow it carefully,"" he said.

Without the word ""cancer,"" Dr. Epstein said, men may not take seriously the need for regular biopsies and other tests. He and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins proposed a grading system to make it clear that Gleason 6 cells are less frightening than higher-grade tumors, but not necessarily benign. In the Gleason system, which involves a pathologist's assessment of how ominous the prostate cells look, 6 is actually pretty much the lowest score for cells that are cancer, despite the Gleason scale officially starting at 2. The highest is a 10. But many men, hearing that their cancer is a 6, assume the worst. In the new system, which has been endorsed by the World Health Organization, instead of calling the cells Gleason 6, they will be called Group 1 in a scale that goes from 1 to 5. One issue complicating the active surveillance questions, said Dr. Alan J. Wein, the chief of urology at the Perelman School of Medicine, is that the long-term outcomes are unclear. ""We need follow-up of at least 10 to 15 years to be sure we are not hurting these people,"" he said. ""The problem is we've been in the active surveillance business only since about 2000, and everyone started off very, very slowly. No one really has a number of patients who have gone for years and years."" Dr. Wein advocates active surveillance for most men with low-risk cancers. But he emphasizes that they should have a second biopsy within a year, followed by regular biopsies every year or two and regular PSA tests, a blood tests that looks for a protein linked to prostate cancers.

""I tell patients, this is a bet,"" he said. ""You are betting that the disease is not going to progress, or if it progresses, you will be able to tell before it progresses to a situation where it is less treatable. You enhance the chances of winning the bet by doing a confirmatory biopsy."" Mike Steskal, a commodities trader who lives and works just outside Philadelphia, decided to take the bet. He is 55 and was told last summer that he had prostate cancer after his doctor ordered a blood test for flulike symptoms that happened to include a PSA test. His PSA level was slightly elevated, which led to more tests, including a biopsy that showed a Gleason 6 cancer. Mr. Steskal spent months seeing different doctors, most of whom recommended aggressive treatment because he is so young. He also researched prostate cancer on the Internet and talked to men who had gone through various treatments. Finally, he chose active surveillance. As part of the surveillance, he had two more PSA tests. They came back with levels so low that no one would ever have suspected prostate cancer. His higher level last summer was probably due to an infection, which can cause PSA levels to rise. ""It was pure chance"" that he got a prostate cancer diagnosis, Mr. Steskal said. ""That's another thing that went into my decision."" Bruce Perry of Charleston, W.Va., who was a similar age when he received a diagnosis of prostate cancer, said he wished he had had a chance to make that bet. He was 57 when he learned he had a Gleason 6 cancer in 2010. ""I'm like, 'Oh my God. That is a bad cancer,'"" he said. ""The problem with men, when they find out they have something like this, it's like, 'Get it out now, I don't want it in me.' With prostate cancer, I now know that's not the right attitude.""","The approach, called active surveillance, involves regular monitoring. Data finds that 40 percent to 50 percent of men are making that choice.",2843c3d0-0042-5138-a105-ff6fd0036ec7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/25/science/25PROSTATE1/25PROSTATE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=acb0c08c7d32abb79fc42b738dfdf7103e83025fd87170104083708265de470b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Bruce Perry of Charleston, W.Va., said his doctors never discussed active surveillance when he received his diagnosis.",2843c3d0-0042-5138-a105-ff6fd0036ec7,N24News/imgs/2843c3d0-0042-5138-a105-ff6fd0036ec7.jpg,1
Style,Does Hispanic Heritage Month Need a Rebrand?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/style/does-hispanic-heritage-month-need-a-rebrand.html,"El Espace is a column dedicated to news and culture relevant to Latinx communities. Expect politics, arts, analysis, personal essays and more. ?Lo mejor? It'll be in Spanish and English, so you can forward it to your tia, your primo Lalo or anyone else (read: everyone). It's almost Sept. 15, which means any day now my Instagram stories will be packed with cringe-worthy ads targeted at the Latinx community: references to chanclas and cafecitos, or social media managers of corporate accounts trying to tweet in Spanish. That's what Hispanic Heritage Month has been reduced to in my eyes: a month when brands pander to us, hoping to convince us to spend our last few centavos. National Hispanic Heritage Month has been around since 1988, when Ronald Reagan signed a bill to extend a weeklong celebration -- ""National Hispanic Heritage Week"" had been introduced two decades earlier -- into a full month. Back then, it was viewed as a step toward visibility, named after the new shared label, Hispanic, that had come into use to refer to Spanish and Latin American descendants living in the United States. But fast forward to 2019, and Hispanic Heritage Month seems to have lost its sheen. Many of us bristle at the persistence of the term ""Hispanic,"" given its connection to Spain and colonization. Those with African and indigenous roots often feel left out of conversations and celebrations under that label. And while the time period, Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, is significant because seven Latin American countries celebrate their independence in that span, this association presents a complication: When dozens of countries' traditions are meant to be represented, are any of them actually getting their due?

These challenges raise the question of what Hispanic Heritage Month should look like in 2019. First, let's talk about the name. G. Cristina Mora, an associate professor of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, and author of ""Making Hispanics: How Activists, Bureaucrats, and Media Constructed a New American,"" said the term Hispanic emerged both as a ""fight for recognition"" and an ""administrative quandary."" After the 1970 census severely undercounted Latinx populations, the Census Bureau developed a Spanish Origin Advisory Committee made up of activists, academics and civic leaders to tackle the problem. Soon, intense debates about how to address the issue emerged: Should the new label focus on commonality of the Spanish language? Should it center race? A shared experience of colonization? Some argued ""Latino"" too closely resembled ""Latin American,"" and preferred to distinguish themselves from a transient immigrant community. Others felt focusing the label on the Spanish language connected them too closely to their European colonizers. To complicate matters, there were generations of folks in New Mexico who embraced the term ""Hispano""; these communities cherished both their Spanish and their Apache, Comanche, Pueblo or other Indigenous ancestry. ""Even if they had never set foot in Spain,"" Mora said, many claimed this part of their heritage as a mechanism to avoid discrimination, particularly during the Jim Crow era. ""Hispanic"" was presented as an English-language parallel to the New Mexican term ""Hispano,"" one that could be reframed into a catchall to include dozens of nationalities, races and identities. ""Hispanic became the imperfect compromise,"" and eventually became a census category in 1980, Mora said. Since then, the word Latino (and, more recently, the gender-inclusive term Latinx) has become more widely adopted, calling into question the continued use of Hispanic in the federally observed commemoration. Janel Martinez, a multimedia journalist who started Ain't I Latina?, an online publication that highlights black Latinas, said she doesn't refer to the month by its official name at all, instead calling it Latinx Heritage Month. But she says the issue goes deeper than terminology. ""Though these 'all-inclusive' terms were designed as umbrella terms to unify and reflect a shared culture, it's clear not everyone is included,"" Martinez said. ""Those of us who often exist on the outskirts of the definition, such as black and/or Indigenous Latinxs, we've created our own safe spaces to celebrate ourselves during the month and beyond."" Martinez also added that she'd like to see the month include conversations about ""how equitable and inclusive spaces are being created to center"" the existence of black and Indigenous Latinos and ""issues that disproportionately impact us.""

Saudi Garcia, a racial justice activist and facilitator for the conflict resolution organization In Cultured Company, which focuses primarily on Dominican-Haitian relations, said she preferred to identify as an ""afrodescendant."" When the term Hispanic was introduced, said Garcia, ""it came from a space of, 'There isn't room for us in this society.'"" But she added that today, the umbrella term erases important differences in race, culture, language and class. Garcia said she did not know what Hispanic Heritage Month should be called instead, but what was clear to her was that it needed a shift in intent. ""Yes, there is something particular about being a Latin American child of immigrants,"" Garcia said. ""The work in the '70s was gaining some visibility as a community of immigrants. Now the work is turning to combat the negative beliefs within our own Latinx communities here,"" such as colorism and anti-blackness. Hispanic Heritage Month should go beyond mere celebration, she said, and instead focus on intercommunal conversations that will move our communities forward. Read about the Mexican artist Francisco Toledo, ""the prototype of the artist-activist for his region of the world."" Read all about ""Hustlers"": why it matters that it's helmed by women, whether J.Lo deserves an Oscar for her performance and an interview in which the actress answers reader questions. One of the most visible signs of government neglect and environmental catastrophe in Puerto Rico is its disappearing schools. Hundreds have closed over the last three years.","For starters, why is ""Hispanic"" still part of the name?",2dc119f1-7c70-5fea-abb1-360cb7f1a828,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/13/fashion/13elespace01/13elespace01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=d7f35b00e88e227a635820d2b8cd37bed1baef5d67793315d3e657eb57cdb79e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A 2017 Hispanic Heritage Month celebration.,2dc119f1-7c70-5fea-abb1-360cb7f1a828,N24News/imgs/2dc119f1-7c70-5fea-abb1-360cb7f1a828.jpg,15
Movies,'Never Rarely Sometimes Always' Review: A Woman's Heroic Journey,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/movies/never-rarely-sometimes-always-review.html,"Hi. My name is Eliza Hittman. And I am the writer and director of 'Never Rarely Sometimes Always.' ""I want to spend a few minutes talking with you about your relationships, O.K.? Because they can affect your health. Did you know that?"" The scene that you're watching an excerpt from is the pivotal scene of the entire film. The main character-- her name is Autumn. The actor's name is Sidney Flanigan-- has finally reached Planned Parenthood in Brooklyn. And she is going through her intake questionnaire with a counselor before she has an abortion. The scene is shot actually at Margaret Sanger, which is a Planned Parenthood on Bleecker Street. And that level of authenticity was really important for me in shooting the film. And the actress, Sidney Flanigan, is doing the scene not with another actor, but with an actual counselor named Kelly Chapman who I met doing research for the film. ""Always."" ""Why are you asking me this?"" ""I want to make sure that you're safe."" The shooting style of the scene was very simple, intentionally so. I didn't want to do anything stagy to get in the way of the intimacy of the questions that are being asked. ""Your partner has hit you, slapped you, or physically hurt you. Never, rarely, sometimes, always."" So we went for a very stripped down, minimal approach. We used two cameras. One is frontal on Sidney, and one is actually 3/4 profile. And those two cameras were pushed very, very, very close to her. Because we wanted to trap her a little bit to intensify the emotions of the scene. ""It's just a couple more questions, all right?"" I spent a lot of time rehearsing the scene, because it was so important. And on the day that we shot, I took Sidney aside. Because, sometimes, when you work on an independent film set, it's a little like being on a construction site. And I wanted to quarantine her away from all of the commotion. And I found a private office for her to sit in. And she sat for several hours. And I remember, I came in, and she said, I'm ready, let's do it. And the scene that is in the film, it's actually the first take. Then after she did it, she said it was cathartic, and she couldn't do it again. - Has anyone forced you into a sexual act ever in your lifetime? Yes or no.","In this stirring drama, the director Eliza Hittman tells an intimate story that is also a potent argument about self-determination.",11a54050-1ce9-598c-9719-8da2beb3eea3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/13/arts/13NEVER-RARELY-1/13NEVER-RARELY-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=d6de35ecf6ed8241e17f0bf18282adda3e8ca38c4c4319037c453e717a3b7573&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Sidney Flanigan in a scene from Eliza Hittman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Never Rarely Sometimes Always.&rdquo;,11a54050-1ce9-598c-9719-8da2beb3eea3,N24News/imgs/11a54050-1ce9-598c-9719-8da2beb3eea3.jpg,5
Real Estate,"In Downtown Brooklyn, a Rental With No Stairs",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/realestate/downtown-brooklyn-no-stairs-rental-for-elderly-couple.html,"When Chuck and Cindy Nemser bought their Park Slope townhouse in 1966, an aunt of Ms. Nemser's observed that there was no bathroom on the main floor. ""She said, 'You will regret it,' and she was right,"" Ms. Nemser said the other day. Ms. Nemser had been eager to move for a few years. Because of unexplained nerve pain, it had become increasingly difficult for her to live in a house with stairs. And as time passed, she and her husband found themselves less interested in tending the backyard, finally hiring a gardener. To help them sell their home and find a new one, a cousin of Ms. Nemser's connected the couple about two years ago with Stefania Cardinali, who was then an associate broker with Citi Habitats and is now at the Corcoran Group. The townhouse -- three stories and a basement -- sold for $3.3 million this past winter. The Nemsers' original purchase price was $32,500. As for their next headquarters, their wish list included, beyond a stair-free home, two spacious bedrooms, a parking spot and a good view for Ms. Nemser, 78, who spends much of her time in bed. She's an art historian and an author; Mr. Nemser, 80, is a retired industrial tool salesman. Something in a high-rise might fit the bill.

They wanted a lobby that was ""easy in, easy out,"" Ms. Cardinali said -- no steps, no long hallways, no slippery floors. The Nemsers wished to remain in New York, and particularly in Park Slope, but its housing stock is mostly townhouses with stairs rather than full-service high-rises. In a co-op or condo building, the long-term renewal of a lease from a unit owner might be a problem. ""Rental stock was the most reasonable,"" Ms. Cardinali said. Brooklyn Heights had some possibilities, but those buildings were way over the couple's budget, which was $4,000 to $6,000 a month. Some parts of Downtown Brooklyn were chaotic, filled with noisy construction.

""At the end of the day,"" Cathy Nemser said, ""it seems that in a way, Brooklyn is not that elderly-friendly -- unless you're just loaded."" Manhattan's Upper East Side was an option. But there, buildings ""were going up and blocking views,"" Cathy Nemser said. And some well-located rental high-rises were too small as well as too pricey. Ms. Cardinali checked out many spaces. ""I knew in their mind's eye what they wanted, but unfortunately it didn't exist,"" she said.

In any event, the clock was ticking. The purchasers of their house were waiting to start renovating. One winter day, Ms. Nemser was persuaded to visit some two-bedrooms in Downtown Brooklyn that Ms. Cardinali thought might do. At Bklyn/Air, a new high-rise on Gold Street, they saw a penthouse for $5,875 a month. But the curved living room wall did not suit. ""It had a semicircle plan rather than straight lines"" that would make it hard to arrange the furniture, Cathy Nemser said. Ms. Nemser also thought the bedrooms were too small. ""When I heard her talking about putting the bed in the living room, I thought, 'This is not working,' "" Ms. Cardinali said.

A few blocks away, in what is often considered Fort Greene, another new high-rise, 66 Rockwell, had two apartments with spectacular views, one renting for around $4,700 a month and the other for around $5,100. But they also seemed to Ms. Nemser to be on the small side. And both were on high floors, which would make for ""a long ride in the elevator up and down,"" she said. ""I could see it wouldn't work out, although sitting by the window you could watch all day long."" They came at last to a new rental building of 10 stories, Ms. Cardinali's favorite all along. An apartment was available on the top floor. Besides two bedrooms, the place had two bathrooms and a washer-dryer. Its 1,250 square feet and boxy rooms would allow plenty of space for furniture. The view included the Manhattan skyline and an exit ramp from the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. ""We could do a traffic report,"" Ms. Nemser said.

The rent was near the top of their budget, $5,495 a month, plus monthly fees of $150 for parking in the building's garage and $19 for a storage bin. It wouldn't be available for long. The Nemsers had to decide quickly. And they did, renting the apartment and moving in this past winter. Now, they are relieved to be well situated in a comfortable place, although they do have quibbles. The open kitchen doesn't quite suit. In so many listings, Ms. Nemser said, ""they show you pictures of people using bar stools, but I knew I wasn't going to be doing that.""","Chuck and Cindy Nemser left their long-held townhouse in Park Slope, Brooklyn, for a rental that offered easier living.",c87e1a15-d87e-5157-95e3-2cd0c7af2a3f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/07/realestate/07HUNTMAIN/07HUNT-MAIN-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=4fa42aa8c2d06a435445dd5c6f9fc2bb04f4a5d53d18654aadb125f9e31c8cd1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,THE RENTERS Chuck and Cindy Nemser's new home came with a spectacular change of scene.,c87e1a15-d87e-5157-95e3-2cd0c7af2a3f,N24News/imgs/c87e1a15-d87e-5157-95e3-2cd0c7af2a3f.jpg,7
Style,ASAP Ferg Feels 'Like a Walking MoMA Installation',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/style/asap-ferg-tiffany.html,"ASAP Ferg is the first male rapper to act as a spokesman for Tiffany & Co. In a recent interview, he said he planned to use the partnership to teach ""kids about wealth versus being rich and just having gaudy jewelry."" Nathan Bajar for The New York Times

When ASAP Ferg was still a teenager in Harlem, he started making crystal-studded pendants. He would sketch designs of characters like Bart Simpson and Mega Man, then hand the drawings over to Earl Harley (also known as ""Harley, the buckle man""). Mr. Harley would create the bases for Ferg, who would then add Swarovski crystals and sell the pendants. They cost him about $200 to make; he sold them for about $700 a piece. A decade later, Ferg, born Darold Ferguson Jr., is hawking pricier gems. This month, he became the first male rapper to appear as a spokesman for Tiffany & Co., the luxury jeweler. Ferg, 29, is not yet a megastar nor the most famous artist in the ASAP crew (that would be Rocky). But in collaborating with him, Tiffany has aligned itself with a princeling of Harlem fashion who aims to honor the legacy of his father, the designer Darold Ferguson Sr., by out-accomplishing him. During a recent interview at The Blue Box Cafe at the Tiffany flagship store on Fifth Avenue, Ferg was frank about the mutual interest driving the partnership. ""I feel like we open up doors for each other,"" he said of Tiffany. ""I show them my world, they show me their world.""

In working with him, the jewelry brand follows other luxury brands that have sought to reupholster their stuffy brand images by collaborating with luminaries of the hip-hop world. The conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton recruited Jay-Z as a brand ambassador for its Hublot watches in 2011, and in the years since, it has been rewarded with hundreds of bars, from his songs and others', testifying to the status of its brands. Virgil Abloh, Kanye West's longtime creative director, was tapped in March as the artistic director of men's wear at Louis Vuitton. And in January, Gucci opened a studio with the Harlem fashion legend Dapper Dan, who worked with Ferg's father and is close enough with the rapper to refer to him as his nephew. Before Mr. Ferguson Sr. died of kidney failure in 2005, days before Ferg's 17th birthday, he designed T-shirts for stars like Teddy Riley and Heavy D and logos, like the one he created for Bad Boy Records. Also in 2005, Ferg started his own line, Devoni Clothing. ""I always ask my grandmother, when did my father have his first car, when did my father have his first apartment,"" he said. ""That was a way of measuring myself."" Eventually, Rocky, who had known Ferg for years, helped convince him to start making music in addition to designing clothing. A couple of studio albums and mixtapes into his career, Ferg now feels as if he's beginning to reach a new level of fame.

Ferg's love of jewelry is obvious in his music. The first verse of his highest-charting song to date, a remix of his 2018 single ""Plain Jane,"" opens with him decked out in a chain he had made in honor of his friend ASAP Yams, the mastermind behind the ASAP crew, who died in 2015. In a song he created with the actress Elle Fanning, ""Moon River,"" he raps about a Tiffany grill with all gold filling. If such a piece were real, it would be the first grill manufactured by the company. (""I'm a strong believer in talking things into existence and I've gotten everything I wanted so far,"" Ferg said.) These days, he cares less about flash. He said he believes in the artistic value of the jewelry he's promoting -- referring to himself as a ""a walking MoMA installation"" -- but also understands what it could mean for young people to see him wearing gold from Tiffany & Co. ""I couldn't afford anything in here so I never walked in the store,"" he said, gesturing at the room. ""Kids, I can imagine them feeling the same way, they didn't have anything to connect to."" He imagined what he might say to someone from his neighborhood: ""I came from where you came from. You could attain this as well.""","The Harlem rapper talks about jewelry, his new partnership with Tiffany & Co. and his drive to one-up his father's legacy.",8f6c29dd-c3a9-5738-96e6-a8a7fbeea5a6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/01/fashion/01FERG/01FERG-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=26e2e97bc86ff7739f079a33e2ace251fe1bc8f41c260303a511ff5dcd0708a9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Rapper, A$AP Ferg at Blue Box Cafe.",8f6c29dd-c3a9-5738-96e6-a8a7fbeea5a6,N24News/imgs/8f6c29dd-c3a9-5738-96e6-a8a7fbeea5a6.jpg,15
Music,A History of Blue Note Records in 15 Albums,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/arts/music/blue-note-records-essential-albums.html,"After hearing Meade (Lux) Lewis and Albert Ammons at the historic ""From Spirituals to Swing"" concert at Carnegie Hall in late 1938, Albert Lion approached t he famed stride pianists , and a few weeks later, they entered a New York studio and made the first Blue Note recordings. Lion invited Ammons back in spring 1939, this time with a band, to record a few sides in the chugging boogie-woogie style that Ammons had recently helped popularize. Christened the Port of Harlem Jazzmen, the thrown-together sextet was the first full-on ensemble recorded for the label.

As bebop became the vanguard in the 1940s, Lion and his partner, Francis Wolff, kept their ears to the ground. Bud Powell, one of bebop's inventors, fronted an all-star quintet on his first Blue Note session, with an already-impressive Sonny Rollins, then just 18 years old, on tenor saxophone. Recorded in 1949, the album was released as a 10-inch LP three years later.

Thelonious Monk was one of Powell's closest friends and musical counterparts. Monk's sharp-edged, percussive style of playing -- and composing -- had turned off critics for years before Lion and Wolff took a chance on him. In 1947, they recorded his first sides as a leader, eventually released as the LP ""Genius of Modern Music."" Soon afterward, he went back into the studio, this time with the vibraphonist Milt Jackson joining his ensemble. Though many of the tunes (including the off-kilter masterpiece ""Evidence"") were Monk's, the music was originally released under solely Jackson's name. By the time the label started putting out 12-inch vinyls in 1956, Monk's star was on the rise, and it credited the reissue to both Monk and Jackson. This became the first Blue Note LP to feature cover art from Reid Miles, whose crisp designs would become a symbol of the label's identity -- and jazz at large.

John Coltrane's one and only recording for Blue Note is among his finest records. In a move that was rare for other labels, Blue Note paid Coltrane's band for its rehearsal time; as a result, the group cruises crisply through Coltrane's challenging originals, particularly ""Lazy Bird"" and ""Moment's Notice."" On the title track, a proclamatory blues, his solo took such a radical approach to rhythm and harmony that he inspired an often-cited work of jazz criticism, by Zita Carno in The Jazz Review, examining his musical ideas in detail for the first time, and proclaiming that Coltrane's ""command of the instrument is almost unbelievable.""

This album represents the height of modal jazz: music that has all the component parts of hard-bop, but with the harmonies cooled and simplified, creating a sense of indeterminacy and suspension. It's an opportunity to hear Herbie Hancock make some of his most inventive statements as an improviser, seeming to exploit every angle of every chord.

By the mid-1960s, Blue Note had come on board with the free-jazz revolution sweeping across the jazz world. This recording, by the titan of avant-garde piano Cecil Taylor, is an unrelenting but expertly crafted barrage of smashed-up textures and rhythms that are always in the process of being ripped up and begun anew.

A flutist and vocalist who mixed velvety textures and nonstop grooves, Bobbi Humphrey became one of Blue Note's most popular artists of the fusion era. Her biggest success, ""Blacks and Blues"" was entirely composed and produced by Larry Mizell. He and his brother Alphonso became like the Gamble and Huff of Blue Note Records for much of the 1970s, producing a small harvest of catchy crossover albums by Humphrey and the trumpeter Donald Byrd.

James Hurt was among a cohort of talented young musicians coming up in the late 1990s whose careers were buffeted by a downturn in the recording industry. He recorded ""Dark Grooves, Mystical Rhythms"" just before the Napster bubble burst, and he was quickly dropped from the label after its release. But nowadays, this largely forgotten album feels like a link between jazz's old barrelhouse history, the globalist avant-funk of the M-Base collective (to which Allen belonged) and the hip-hop fusions to come. It's also a reminder of Blue Note's continued engagement with jazz's cutting-edge.

Norah Jones's debut album turned her into an instant sensation, and profoundly impacted the label's creative (and commercial) direction in the new millennium. The smoky butterscotch of her voice; the twinkling tapestry of piano and acoustic guitar; the coffeehouse songwriting of Ms. Jones and her bandmates -- it all made ""Come Away With Me"" into the choice for the average American family struggling to agree what to play on the car stereo, moved about 30 million copies (more than any Blue Note album before or since) and earned her an armful of ore at the Grammys.

The standard-bearing trumpeter of his generation, Ambrose Akinmusire made a splash in 2011 with his shape-shifting Blue Note debut, and since then he's continued to undermine assumptions about what a jazz trumpeter or composer ought to be doing. His most recent album is his most ambitious, putting a tersely arranged string quartet into conversation with jerky, post-hip-hop instrumentals, and inviting the rapper Kool A.D. to spit verses untethered from the rhythms around him.",The most storied label in jazz turns 80 this year.

Automobiles,2015 Dodge Challenger and Charger: Retro Retooled,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/18/automobiles/2015-dodge-challenger-and-charger-retro-retooled.html,"What makes it tick? Both cars get Chrysler's 8-speed automatic transmission, which, according to the automaker, will improve fuel economy and performance. Engine options include a 3.6-liter V-6 and a 5.7-liter Hemi V-8 that generates 375 horsepower in the Challenger and 370 in the Charger. A new Scat Pack Challenger model is offered with a 470-horsepower 6.4-liter Hemi V-8. In a news release, Dodge said the car would be capable of zero-to-60 in the mid 4-second range, 12-second quarter-miles and a top speed of 182 m.p.h.

How does it look? The Challenger looks more like the early '70s car that inspired it than did the last version. That retro reference is achieved in part with front-end styling and a split tail lamp design that reference the '70s styling.

Music,Review: An Extraordinary 'Elektra' Shows a Path Forward for the Met,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/arts/music/elektra-review-met-opera.html,"The Metropolitan Opera is struggling right now, facing longstanding challenges like declining tickets sales and a shriveling donor base, as well as looming ones like coming labor negotiations. But Thursday's extraordinary performance of Richard Strauss's ""Elektra"" pointed a way out of the company's problems: Just keep presenting opera on this level, and all should be fine. The intense, tormented one-act opera lasts just over 100 minutes. And I was swept up in every moment of the rapturous, terrifying and moving performance. Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager, has made some mistakes during his tenure. But Thursday's ""Elektra"" is the result, in part, of three smart calls he made, each of which bodes well for the future. He brought in the visionary director Patrice Chereau, who was responsible for two milestone productions: a grimly powerful staging of Janacek's ""From the House of the Dead,"" then this ""Elektra"" in 2016, a collaboration with other companies that, sadly, arrived at the Met nearly three years after Mr. Chereau died in 2013. The production places the bloody saga of the house of Agamemnon in a vaguely updated setting: the drab, stone courtyard of the dead king's palace in Mycenae, where the tale plays out like the ultimate dysfunctional family drama.

In another savvy move, Mr. Gelb went calling on Christine Goerke with contracts to sign once it became clear that she was developing into the most impressive dramatic soprano of her time. She now owns the role of Elektra, as she demonstrated on Thursday with this overwhelming performance. And next season, she will bring her acclaimed Brunnhilde to the Met for the first complete revival Robert Lepage's much-debated production of Wagner's ""Ring."" The third wise move on Mr. Gelb's part was placing the artistic future of the company in the hands of Yannick Nezet-Seguin. His magnificent account of Wagner's ""Parsifal"" just ended a seven-performance run. And on Thursday he led a blazing and urgent, yet richly nuanced account of Strauss's still-shocking score, first performed in Dresden, Germany, in 1909. This immensely gifted, youthful conductor was not scheduled to become the company's music director until 2020. But when James Levine was suspended in December following allegations of sexual misconduct, something had to be done to fill the leadership vacuum. Mr. Gelb persuaded Mr. Nezet-Seguin to shift commitments around so that he could start his tenure with the new season this fall.

This ""Elektra"" showed him at his best. All the modernist elements of the music came through with slashing incisiveness and piercing sound, from the opening orchestral blast of chords that signal the motif of Agamemnon, murdered by his wife, Klytamnestra, and her lover Aegisth, and mourned every day with obsessive compulsion by Elektra, his daughter. But I was ever more impressed by the subtleties and lyricism Mr. Nezet-Seguin drew from the music, which has moments of plush, shimmering allure that conductors with a blunter approach often miss. Now and then, though, especially during the opening scenes, Mr. Nezet-Seguin let the orchestra erupt with too much brassy fervor. Even Ms. Goerke, with all the thrilling power of her voice, was covered by the orchestra during some crucial outbursts.

In every moment her courageous singing exposed the tormented nature of this mystifying character, who lives to avenge her murdered father. Yet, as Ms. Goerke made clear, Elektra is all talk, a young woman who has adopted the identity of the avenging child and seems powerless to take any action. She stalks around the palace like an unkempt animal, say the servants who both mock and fear her. The scenes between Elektra and her sister, Chrysothemis, here the exciting soprano Elza van den Heever, were extremely moving. Chrysothemis is also shocked by the brutality of her mother. But she wants to break free of the palace, which is like a prison, and the seething hatred within her family. She wants children, a husband -- even a peasant will do, she says. Ms. van den Heever's melting, plaintive singing conveyed the character's fragile emotions beautifully. But during intense confrontations with Elektra, Ms. van den Heever cut loose with steely outbursts that showed inner strength you don't normally detect in the this character, making her seem, however fleetingly, like Elektra's soul mate. The mezzo-soprano Michaela Schuster had a notable Met debut as the guilt-ridden Klytamnestra. She brought glint and terror to moments when her fears took hold, and was even more chilling when she unfurled her scheming thoughts in breathy utterances. The crucial scene comes during the reunion between Elektra and her beloved brother, Orest, come to seek justice for their father. This is music of longing and beauty, with tender vocal lines unfolding atop gently rocking orchestral figures. With the strong-voiced, stalwart bass Mikhail Petrenko as Orestes, Ms. Goerke at her most vulnerable, and the orchestra playing with undulant sway and pungent colorings, the scene was a moment of affecting repose -- before the murderous, harrowing finale.","The Metropolitan Opera is struggling on several fronts.

In a statement, Mr. Fry expressed his affection for the Bafta show and his colleagues there: ""Over the last two decades I have especially loved watching the emergence of new young film talent behind and in front of the camera. But after so long a time I felt it only right to stand down and let others take the Baftas on to new heights and greater glories.""

Mr. Fry served as host from 2001 to 2006, andfrom 2012 to 2017. The comedian and television presenter Jonathan Ross hosted in the intervening years.

Science,Judge Prods Wildlife Service on Protection for Wolverines,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/08/science/wolverines-endangered-fish-and-wildlife-service-montana.html,"HELENA, Mont. -- Because it depends on heavy spring snowpack to excavate dens and safely raise its young near the top of mountain peaks high in the northern Rockies, the wolverine is on the front lines of battles over the effects of climate change. There is less snow in the Rockies these days, and researchers forecast that in the coming decades, the wolverines in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming may disappear with the snowpack. Only about 300 of the animals are in the lower 48 states. In 2014, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service refused to list the animal for endangered species protection, calling the science inconclusive. The debate over protection for the reclusive animal, the largest in the weasel family, has been going on for about 20 years, and it was revived this week by a federal court ruling here in Montana. Chief Judge Dana L. Christensen of United States District Court for Montana on Monday rebuked the agency in a lengthy court decision, citing the ""immense political pressure that was brought to bear"" by Western states on the question of whether to list the wolverine, rather than relying on sound science. The states of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming, along with the petroleum industry and other groups, have opposed granting the wolverine the designation of a threatened species.

Judge Christensen ordered the agency to go back and reconsider its reasoning under the Endangered Species Act. (During the trial, the judge noted that he had seen the elusive animal three times.) ""No greater level of certainty is needed to see the writing on the wall for this snow-dependent species standing squarely in the path of global climate change,"" Judge Christensen wrote. ""It's the undersigned's view that if there is one thing required of the service under the E.S.A. it is to take action at the earliest possible, defensible point in time to protect against the loss of biodiversity within our reach as a nation. For the wolverine, that time is now.""

The decision not to list, the judge wrote, ""was arbitrary and capricious."" But Dan Ashe, the director of the Fish and Wildlife Service, adamantly denied that the decision was based on anything but science. ""I cannot disagree more strongly,"" he said. The judge ""made a sweeping statement about political interference for which there is not a shred of evidence."" The wolverine is a cryptic, reclusive animal, he said, and definitive science is lacking. In February 2013, the agency proposed listing the wolverine as a threatened species, a lesser designation than endangered.

But Mr. Ashe, in describing the service's decision in 2014 against protections for the wolverine, said: ""We were presented with inconclusive scientific information and decided against the listing. The wolverine is not at risk of extinction, which is different than saying the wolverine is not going to be affected by a changing climate."" Still, scientific experts and environmental groups who filed the lawsuit said they were dismayed that the Fish and Wildlife Service's decision appeared to be political and welcomed the judge's decision. ""It's not just a win for the species, but a win for science,"" said Matthew Bishop, a lawyer for the Western Environmental Law Center here, which challenged the decision on behalf of 22 groups. ""Five papers said there's a significant connection between wolverines and climate change and not a single one suggested there isn't. They chose to disregard the science."" There is a disagreement about the impact of climate change on wolverines, but ""instead of having a debate, the tactic they chose was to discredit the science and the scientists personally,"" said Jeff Copeland, a former wolverine biologist for the Forest Service and one of the researchers on key papers about the relationship between wolverines and deep snow. He now does research for the Wolverine Foundation. Existing research on the animal is clear, he said. ""Wolverines don't reproduce in the absence of snow,"" he said. ""Climate change is going to have a real impact on wolverines."" Wolverines raise their young in dens they dig deep in the snow in an ecological niche between rock and ice and the tree line, tunneling and living down there with their cubs until about the second week of May. While much is unknown, experts say that as the snow season grows shorter, the wolverine may no longer be able to den and reproduction will most likely decline.

The genetic variability in so small a population is also a concern. Other threats include trapping. As a scavenger, the wolverines often gets caught in traps set for other animals, and Montana would like to allow trappers to take the animal. Wolverines are also sensitive to intrusions in the high country by recreationists, especially with snowmobiles. Some snowmobile groups have opposed protections out of concerns that they will block access to the backcountry. Mr. Copeland said that he was working on a wolverine project in the Teton Mountains of Wyoming, where recreational use is heavy, and a team had only been able to trap one male, even though there were as many as eight or 10 animals there not long ago. The wolverine, sometimes referred to as the mountain devil, is a one-of-a-kind creature, earning respect and admiration from those who study it. Males weigh less than 40 pounds, but are extremely fierce, often fight well above their weight, and have been known to kill an adult bull moose. ""They have an insatiable need to keep moving,"" Mr. Copeland said, and they wander wide in their search for food across the rocks and snow of the mountains, sometimes traveling as much as 25 miles in a day. ""The wolverine is a tremendous character,"" wrote the naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton in the 1920s, ""a personality of unmeasured force, courage and achievement.""",The chief federal district judge in Montana said the reclusive mountain animal may fall victim to reduced snowfall related to climate change.,8d505b34-07e1-584a-ba7b-cafeed700c4d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/08/science/08WOLVERINE/08WOLVERINE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=3be947a7010d65cb99d2058b288c17cdf958619f9e3249a07fdf0cb29273dcde&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A wolverine in the Bridger Mountains north of Bozeman, Mont.

Health,"Sex and Drugs Decline Among Teens, but Depression and Suicidal Thoughts Grow",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/health/youth-risk-depression-suicide-opioids.html,"One in seven high school students reported misusing prescription opioids, one of several disturbing results in a nationwide survey of teenagers that revealed a growing sense of fear and despair among youth in the United States. The numbers of teenagers reporting ""feelings of sadness or hopelessness,"" suicidal thoughts, and days absent from school out of fear of violence or bullying have all risen since 2007. The increases were particularly pointed among lesbian, gay and bisexual high school students. Nationally, 1 in 5 students reported being bullied at school; 1 in 10 female students and 1 in 28 male students reported having been physically forced to have sex. ""An adolescent's world can be bleak,"" said Dr. Jonathan Mermin, an official with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which conducted the survey and analyzed the data. ""But having a high proportion of students report they had persistent feelings of hopelessness and 17 percent considering suicide is deeply disturbing.""

In 2017, 31 percent of students surveyed said they had such feelings, while 28 percent said so in 2007. In 2017, nearly 14 percent of students had actually made a suicide plan, up from 11 percent in 2007. The Youth Risk Behavior Survey is given every two years to nearly 15,000 students in high schools in 39 states, and poses questions about a wide array of attitudes and activities. The report did offer some encouraging trends, suggesting that the overall picture for adolescents is a nuanced one. Compared to a decade ago, fewer students reported having had sex, drinking alcohol or using drugs like cocaine, heroin or marijuana. Because this was the first time that the question about prescription opioids had been given, the researchers who compiled the report could not say whether the 1 in 7 (or 14 percent) figure represented an increase or decrease. David C. Harvey, a social worker who is executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, said that even without a means of comparison, the numbers offered an important look at the lesser-known impact of opioids on adolescents. He said they strongly suggest that opioid use may be contributing to a rise in sexually transmitted diseases among young people.

Mr. Harvey noted that the report also shows that condom use is declining among teenagers. Fifty-four percent of teens who were sexually active reported using condoms the last time they had sex, compared to 62 percent in 2007. Combining that decline with prescription drug abuse, he said, is ""a recipe for disaster,"" referring to transmissions of HIV and hepatitis as well as other STDs, such as syphilis. Dr. Mermin, director of the C.D.C.'s National Center for HIV/AIDS, viral hepatitis, STD and TB prevention, echoed his concern, and said, ""These numbers call on all of us to respond quickly and effectively."" Although health disparities still remain among races, some sexual risk behaviors are decreasing across the board. The percentage of white students who'd ever had sex, for example, decreased to 39 percent in 2017 from 44 percent in 2007. Among black students, the rate plummeted to 46 percent from 66 percent in 2007 and, among Hispanic students, decreased to 41 percent from 52 percent. Overall, the percentage of students who had ever had sex decreased to 39 percent in 2017 from 48 percent in 2007. Tips for Parents to Help Their Struggling Teens Are you concerned for your teen? If you worry that your teen might be experiencing depression or suicidal thoughts, there are a few things you can do to help. Dr. Christine Moutier, the chief medical officer of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, suggests these steps: Look for changes. Notice shifts in sleeping and eating habits in your teen, as well as any issues he or she might be having at school, such as slipping grades. Watch for angry outbursts, mood swings and a loss of interest in activities they used to love. Stay attuned to their social media posts as well. Keep the lines of communication open. If you notice something unusual, start a conversation. But your child might not want to talk. In that case, offer him or her help in finding a trusted person to share their struggles with instead. Seek out professional support. A child who expresses suicidal thoughts may benefit from a mental health evaluation and treatment. You can start by speaking with your child's pediatrician or a mental health professional. In an emergency: If you have immediate concern for your child's safety, do not leave him or her alone. Call a suicide prevention lifeline. Lock up any potentially lethal objects. Children who are actively trying to harm themselves should be taken to the closest emergency room. Resources If you're worried about someone in your life and don't know how to help, these resources can offer guidance:1. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-8255 (TALK) 2. The Crisis Text Line: Text TALK to 741741 3. The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention The percentage of students who had experienced sexual dating violence declined to 7 percent in 2017 from 10 percent in 2013. Experts said that the decade-long decline in risky sexual behavior and drug and alcohol use underscored the ability of adolescents to make wise choices, which made Dr. Mermin hopeful. ""There's strong data to show that family support and attention by your parents to what you're doing can make a difference in an adolescent's life,"" he said. ""Communities can support access to mental health and substance use services. Schools can offer coping skills and bystander intervention training.""",The C.D.C.'s biannual survey of U.S. high school students also showed increases in bullying and declines in condom use.,6631ec2c-61b9-5a9b-8b30-9d225b5dc027,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/15/science/15CDC/15CDC-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=ba45ec387f5569459a917aac6a2dca3d1514db98cd15145c1385ced382558d43&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Condom use is declining among sexually active teens, a federal survey found.",6631ec2c-61b9-5a9b-8b30-9d225b5dc027,N24News/imgs/6631ec2c-61b9-5a9b-8b30-9d225b5dc027.jpg,1

'MAX BECKMANN IN NEW YORK' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Feb. 20). In the last two years of his life, the great German Expressionist Max Beckmann lived in New York. This terrific exhibition, closing on Feb. 20, gathers paintings that he created during his time here as well as paintings now owned by museums and private collectors in New York, regardless of origin. If this sounds like a recipe for mishmash, it's not: There's not a single dud among the 39 works in the show (left, ""Self-Portrait With a Cigarette""), which will warm the hearts of Beckmann's fans and serve as an excellent introduction for those unfamiliar with his deeply and vigorously humane art.

'MARILYN MINTER: PRETTY/DIRTY' at the Brooklyn Museum (through April 2). This peripatetic but thoroughly engrossing survey reveals an artist who has operated for more than 30 years in the gap defined by feminism, painting and popular culture. Her provocative images borrow from fashion, advertising, burlesque and pornography; push the unpromising 1960s trend of Photo Realism into new areas of gorgeousness and abstraction; and explore the varying ways in which women do and do not own their bodies.

Economy,"No Clarity From Fed on Stimulus, Upsetting Wall Street",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/business/economy/fed-closer-to-easing-back-stimulus-but-still-no-consensus-on-timing.html,"Will they move in September or won't they? The confusion over exactly when the Federal Reserve will begin scaling back its huge economic stimulus efforts only deepened Wednesday, with the release of a summary of the deliberations at the central bank's last meeting in late July. There were hints that some members of the divided committee are comfortable with beginning to ease the Fed's program of buying $85 billion a month in government bonds and mortgage securities as soon as their next meeting in mid-September. But there were also indications that another camp within the policy-setting group favors waiting until December, or even later. The only thing that was clear is that the Fed intends to keep Wall Street -- and the rest of the world -- guessing. For one thing, a number of participants at the Federal Open Market Committee raised concerns that economic growth in the second half of the year would prove disappointing, which would tend to encourage them to delay any changes in their current policy,

In June, the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, indicated the stimulus program could be scaled back this year if economic data continued to be relatively positive. But he avoided setting any target dates to begin what many investors refer to as the Fed's coming ""taper."" The minutes of the meeting did little to clarify the issue. While ""a few members emphasized the importance of being patient and evaluating additional information before deciding on any changes to the pace of asset purchases,"" a few others ""suggested that it might soon be time to slow somewhat the pace of purchases,"" the summary of the July 30-31 meeting said. As a result, longtime Fed watchers came up with analyses so different from one another that it seemed as if they might be reading different documents. In a report issued shortly before the stock market closed, IHS Global Insight concluded that ""the Fed is unlikely to taper at the mid-September meeting,"" and predicted a move in December instead.

Other institutions, like Goldman Sachs, hedged their bets. ""Over all, we think this information is consistent with September tapering, but this is by no means certain,"" the firm said. With Mr. Bernanke all but certain to step down as Fed chairman early next year, most analysts expect the Fed to initiate the tapering process before he leaves office, and to do so at one of the meetings remaining this year -- either September or December -- where Mr. Bernanke is scheduled to conduct a news conference after the session. The committee will also meet in October, but Mr. Bernanke is not scheduled to address the media then. On Wall Street, investors were just as uncertain as economists. After selling off immediately after the minutes were released at 2 p.m., stocks briefly rallied, only to fall back more deeply into negative territory by the end of the trading day. The most widely followed measure of the stock market among professionals, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, fell 9.55 points, or 0.58 percent, to 1,642.80. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 105.44 points, or 0.7 percent, to 14,897.55. The Nasdaq composite index declined 13.80 points, or 0.38 percent, to 3,599.79.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Bond prices also dropped after the release of the Fed's minutes, sending interest rates higher. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note fell 20/32, to 96 20/32, while its yield rose to 2.89 percent, its highest level since July 2011. It was at 2.82 percent late Tuesday. While the difference between a start to the tapering on bond purchases in September vs. December might not seem very significant to most people, the Fed's decision-making is already affecting such things as the value of 401(k) retirement accounts, mortgage rates for home buyers and currency values in many emerging markets of the world. By pumping $85 billion a month into the economy through the bond purchases, the Fed has helped push up prices for many kinds of assets, especially stocks. The indications that the infusions might soon come to an end has generated increased volatility both on Wall Street and in stock exchanges around the world. The bond purchases also have helped push long-term interest rates sharply lower, forcing mortgage rates to record lows. Since Mr. Bernanke first started signaling in the spring that tapering was on the horizon, those rates have increased significantly.

One notable source of strength identified by the Fed policy makers is the housing sector, which helped lead the economy down before the Great Recession, but has led the way during a fitful recovery. Even if mortgages become slightly more costly, they said, the housing market should continue to improve. ""While recent mortgage rate increases might serve to restrain housing activity, several participants expressed confidence that the housing recovery would be resilient in the face of the higher rates,"" the minutes said. Despite upbeat signs like the housing market, Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, said the minutes left him less convinced that the Fed would reverse course in September. ""To me, the minutes nudge you away from an immediate tapering,"" he said. ""It sounds like they are still in the middle of the debate.""","Fed watchers offered very different analyses after the minutes of the central bank's July meeting were released, sending the stock market lower.",db405db7-41da-546a-864c-0a8d3cb8c553,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/22/business/Fedjp/Fedjp-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=d99d43df139bccab619a64dda91d2f00a60f48d89b063ca3b30fc6ad4bd5db48&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Maurice Dolan, a real estate agent, placing an open house sign in San Francisco.

Travel,"Last-Minute Spring Break Trips, Away From the Party Set",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/08/travel/spring-break-last-minute-options-for-the-crowd-averse.html,"Over the last few years Rey Alton, a manager with Travel Leaders in Houston, said he's been booking more adult-only vacations during spring break and that Tulum is indeed a terrific escape for ""grown-ups."" He likes El Dorado Seaside Suites there, an adults-only resort near the Mayan ruins that he said has multiple restaurants and bars, yoga, tennis and a spa.

If the eco-friendly feeling of Tulum appeals, you may also be interested in Roatan, Honduras, which will draw some spring break travelers and scuba divers but, as Donna Scicolone, the owner of Travel Leaders in Solon, Ohio, said, ""there are a couple of very cool, eco-resorts that are more removed and earthy. In addition, Roatan is accessible flight-wise, but has the feel of being an adventurous, remote destination.""

For a last-minute domestic getaway, consider Sanibel Island in Florida. Many of the hotels are sold out for spring break, but Kate Rosevear, the president and owner of Travel Leaders in Plymouth, Mich., said some of the smaller, private hotels still have availability.

""One of the best things about Sanibel and neighboring Captiva, apart from the miles of gorgeous beaches and the relatively calm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, is it is just far enough off the beaten path and pricey enough that its appeal is mostly to adults and/or families with young children,"" she said in an email while on vacation there. ""No 'out of control' Spring Breakers here!,"" she continued. ""One of the other great appeals is that, if it is too late to find reasonable airfares to southwest Florida, you can drive here in a day or two from most of the central, mid and upper Midwest, and Eastern Seaboard states. This is as close as you can come to a 'Caribbean experience' without leaving the continental U.S.""

Florida is a quintessential spring break destination, but Gabe Saglie, a senior editor with Travelzoo, the travel deals website, said Sanibel Island, along with Pensacola and Fort Myers ""still offer awesome beach experiences with less of a party slant."" In California, another major spring break haven, he suggested forgoing Los Angeles and San Diego for more low-key desert communities such as Rancho Mirage and La Quinta.

In general, you can avoid much of the spring break hubbub by choosing upscale hotel brands such as the Four Seasons, Fairmont and Ritz-Carlton, he said, because they may be tougher for large families or young adults to afford. The same can be said of cruises. More affordable lines such as Carnival will attract families and young adults, he said, so opt for lines such as Oceania, Silversea and Seabourn.

Still, there are plenty of large families who can afford to go anywhere they please.

""While small, boutique, high-end properties lessen the odds or overall numbers of kids,"" said Joshua Greenberg, an agent with Protravel International in New York, ""it's no guarantee.""","In need of a quick, sunny getaway?

Art & Design,"An Art Show, by Veterans Armed With Cameras",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/arts/design/veterans-photographs-art.html,"In a 19th-century shopping arcade in downtown Buffalo , spread out between a barber shop and a pet store, a stationery store and an art gallery, the ghosts of American wars cling to the walls. A photography show called ""Odyssey: Warriors Come Home"" has taken over the halls at the Market Arcade, featuring work by 36 veterans, most of whom have served since Sept. 11, 2001. The veterans each participated in a three-month photography workshop , a partnership between the CEPA Gallery and the Veterans One-Stop Center of Western New York , designed to give them an outlet and to help them cope with the challenges of being back in civilian life. Some of the participants had a longstanding interest in art, and some had never taken a picture that wasn't on a cellphone or a disposable camera. But many of these men and women said photography has given them a way to process their past and reconnect with emotions long since shut away. The workshops were taught by Brendan Bannon , a photographer and the founder of the project, and Julian Chinana , a former scout sniper with the Marines. Chinana, who received a purple heart for his service in Afghanistan, has studied photography and is now a police detective. He said that the point of the workshop, as he saw it, was to give veterans a way to communicate without having to have a conversation.

""That's one thing you always hear from all the wars of the past: People always say, 'Grandpa was in World War II, but he never talked about it,'"" Chinana said. ""But just getting it out of your head and out of your body really starts that whole communication. It allows you to start to let go of some of it."" The exhibit, which opened in September, will be up through the end of December . Here are some of the photographic works and the veterans who took them: Deployed to Afghanistan from 2007 to 2008 with the Army National Guard.

This photograph, taken on his living room floor, is a recreation of a painting Sacco made in 2011, when the stress of a divorce and other family issues compounded his struggle returning home from war. ""I had this battle going on in my head and it was hard to express, so I found myself laying around all the time, just separating myself from friends,"" he said. ""That's where the painting came from. I stuffed all that away, and doing the photography brought it back out. It was very, I guess, healing to finish processing that part of my life.""

She helped break the window of a nearby trailer, its frame bent by the explosion, so a trapped soldier could escape. Then she jumped over a concrete barrier, where she saw a group of soldiers and contractors who were watching the flames -- filming it. ""I kind of broke from humanity at that time,"" she said. ""That kind of changed me."" In the photograph, she is handcuffed because she felt helpless to save the soldier and had to bottle up her aggression toward the people who enraged her. It's hard to see, she said, but she is screaming at the flash of a camera, as well as the flames. Deployed to Iraq from 2006 to 2007 with the Army, and to Afghanistan in 2012 with the Army National Guard.

During the Odyssey workshop, Welsted was navigating difficulties in his personal life, and he said the weekly classes became a respite for him, a place of calm. Assigned to take a self portrait, Welsted went to his backyard pool and let himself sink to the bottom of the deep end. He set the camera on a tripod, and his father pushed the button. ""I was trying to emulate the hopelessness of a situation,"" Welsted said. ""I was trying to act calm, just sitting under water. An acceptance .""

Siulc, who said he had always been interested in the arts, made this photograph by layering a picture of the embers in his backyard firepit over a shot he took while his wife was driving them down a road in Hamburg, N.Y. He said he wasn't trying to convey something specific with this photograph, but was experimenting with the skills he was taught in the class. ""You never unsee what you've seen in war,"" he said. ""You either learn to accept it, or you escape through drugs and alcohol, or you escape this world altogether. But the camera, for me, has been a great escape."" From the moment he learned about the class, he said, ""I loved the idea of putting cameras in veterans hands and saying, 'Show me your world after.""",A photography workshop for veterans offered an outlet to help them cope with the challenges of being home.

Travel,"When Guests Want to Check In With Firearms, What Can Hotels Do?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/travel/when-guests-want-to-check-in-with-firearms-what-can-hotels-do.html,"On May 31, 2017, the police arrested a Pennsylvania doctor who had brought guns to a luxury hotel near the White House. What made the incident notable was the hotel's name: Trump International . It is still not known what the doctor, Bryan D. Moles, a former Navy corpsman who a friend described as a ""hard-core Trump supporter,"" planned to do in the nation's capital. What is clear is that the police in Washington, D.C., acting on a tip that an armed man had come to town hoping to meet the president, received full cooperation from Trump hotel staff. Employees informed the officers that the man had checked in and had guns in his car, according to a police affidavit. They provided the police with the key fob to his valet-parked BMW, where the officers found an AR-15-style Bushmaster rifle, a loaded Glock semiautomatic pistol and two 30-round magazines. Then they gave the officers his room number so he could be arrested. Dr. Moles pleaded guilty in federal court in July to carrying a pistol without a license, and agreed to forfeit the weapons in his car and at his home. The Trump Organization and the Washington hotel each refused multiple requests to comment on the incident or state their firearms policies. But other Trump properties have the ""gun-free"" policies the president has condemned at schools and other public places. Asked on a reservations line, a manager at the Trump International Beach Resort in Sunny Isles Beach, Fla., said guests are asked not to bring guns onto that property, even if the owner has a permit and the weapons are locked in a safe.

That inconsistency reflects the larger confusion surrounding gun policies in U.S. hotels. As Americans struggle to balance competing ideas of safety and gun rights, a hotel industry that takes in $245 billion on yearly sales is caught in the middle. The stakes of that debate were raised significantly a year ago last week, when a gunman used his suite at at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas resort to carry out a massacre. Wary of criticism and liability, and operating under a patchwork of state and county firearms laws, hotels have crafted an inconsistent range of gun policies that can vary from door to door on the same street and location to location within the same chain. To help travelers navigate, we've explored the confusing mosaic of gun policies at some of the big hotel chains. But travelers should know that if they want to know the rules at the hotel where they will be staying, they need to call the location itself -- regardless of local law, whether you have a permit or if the property is part of a chain -- and ask.

Much of the discussion about hotel gun policies comes from travelers who want to take their guns on the road. On social media and gun-enthusiast blogs, some criticize hotels that ban weapons as ""gun-free zones."" ""I realize they have a right to do this, just as I have a right to no longer stay here,"" a business traveler who signed in as BixTex wrote on the TripAdvisor site of a Holiday Inn Express in Mansfield, Tex. On the other hand, 70 percent of Americans think guns should be banned outright from schools, bars and sports stadiums, according to the 2015 National Firearms Survey, a national poll designed by Harvard University public health researchers and conducted by the German research firm Growth for Knowledge. More than half of the nearly 4,000 Americans polled said guns should not be allowed in restaurants. (The survey did not ask specifically about hotels.) Several countries, including Canada, Germany and New Zealand, warn travelers to the United States about the easy availability of firearms and the frequency of violence. Most of the hotel industry personnel contacted for this article were loathe to discuss their gun policies. ""It's a no-win situation for us,"" said one representative who requested anonymity for fear of offending potential clients and others in the industry. ""Either we're infringing on rights or we're compromising guest safety."" Hotels are also worried about lawsuits. After the October 2017 mass shooting at the Mandalay Bay, hundreds of victims joined lawsuits accusing the hotel of lax security. MGM Resorts, which owns the hotel, had banned firearms from all its properties before the shooting, which killed 58 people and injured hundreds more. But the gunman spent days smuggling an arsenal of at least 23 firearms into his hotel room hidden in suitcases. Nevada is a permissive open-carry state, meaning that people there can carry firearms in public even without a license. MGM Resorts in turn sued more than 1,000 victims and others, claiming that it cannot be held liable for the shooting under a 2002 federal law. The cases are still pending. The checkerboard of gun policies can seem random and is often independent of local firearms laws, which themselves can vary from state to state and county to county. The organizers of a 2016 biblical literature conference in Texas, which had recently enacted an open-carry law, advised attendees that three hotels on San Antonio's Riverwalk -- the Grand Hyatt, Hyatt Regency and Hilton Palacio del Rio -- banned firearms. The nearby Marriott Riverwalk and Marriott Rivercenter, on the other hand, allowed guns. But even those policies seem to differ: at the Marriott Riverwalk, a security official said guests have to show a firearms license at the front desk before taking their guns to the room. Right across the street at the Marriott Rivercenter, a security official said simply, ""because of the law, you can open carry.""

There are Marriotts in other states, even some in states with open gun laws, that don't allow firearms. And the Hyatt Regency O'Hare in Chicago, in contrast to its Texas cousins, allowed guns when it hosted the Second Amendment Foundation's Gun Rights Policy Conference in September. (Those weapons had to be kept unloaded and secured in a locked, hard-sided firearm container in guests' rooms, Stephanie Lerdall, a senior manager for Hyatt's global corporate communications, said in an email.) Once a hotel has a policy, it has to be enforced. U.S. hotels don't typically have metal detectors or baggage screening, and there is no way for staff members to know what guests are carrying in their luggage. Most hotel representatives would not discuss enforcement procedures in detail, saying that doing so would compromise security. Some hotels post signs at the entrance explaining their gun policies, and several hotel representatives said that they can use trespassing laws to remove a guest who violates them. Las Vegas's Wynn Resorts bans firearms, and has a security team that ""includes crisis and tactical response, a K-9 team, mobile and stationary officers, surveillance and other departments which the company does not disclose,"" a spokesman, Michael Weaver, said. The American Hotel & Lodging Association, a major industry trade group, does not make recommendations about gun policies, a representative said. But it is often up to individual hotel employees to determine when and if the rules are enforced. After citing the policy prohibiting guns at the Trump International Beach Resort in Florida, the reservations agent added: ""Of course, we do not conduct searches at all."" Jonathan M. Katz is a National Fellow at New America and the author of ""The Big Truck That Went By: How the World Came to Save Haiti and Left Behind a Disaster.""","U.S. lodging chains are caught up in the debate over safety and gun rights, leaving a confusion of policies that can vary from location to location.",8fc9537b-9d5b-51df-b70c-1bd62c886b28,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/07/travel/07Getaway-guns/07Getaway-guns-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=41316fc34f555e907b770b7c5b4f6504f033d162b3d53ad66740b374da3309c0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"In October 2017, a gunman smuggled more than 20 firearms into his room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, and killed 58 people attending a music festival below the hotel.",8fc9537b-9d5b-51df-b70c-1bd62c886b28,N24News/imgs/8fc9537b-9d5b-51df-b70c-1bd62c886b28.jpg,4
Fashion & Style,Colin Hanks Learns the Importance of Fashion From Tim Gunn,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/12/fashion/colin-hanks-fashion-tim-gunn.html,"Shoes My default pair of shoes is from this company I found out of Chicago called Oak Street Bootmakers. The one I have is basically a black leather trench boot. Sometime in my 30s, I realized I needed different boots for different scenarios. I have a Red Wing boot for running around. These Oak Streets are my ""fancy"" boot, but I also don't care if they get scuffed up.

Generally, I like brands that have a story. I was never all that into high fashion. I always thought of fashion as kind of silly and sometimes pointless. But then I saw Tim Gunn on the ""Daily Show"" one day, and that kind of blew my mind. He said fashion is like a time capsule: It's of a place and of a time and shows that place in the world at that moment. I've never had anyone explain it to me so simply. That made me think of what fashion could mean from an artistic standpoint.

Accessory I've spent the last five years trying to shed myself of accessories. The one accessory I do love -- I only use it when I wear a tie, which isn't that often -- is a small silver tie clip I stole from the ""Mad Men"" costume department. It's ironic because when I was on the show, I didn't wear a tie. I played a priest. This was the second season of ""Mad Men,"" and it was before it really became a cultural phenomenon. Now they sell them everywhere, but at the time, you could only find them at vintage stores.","The actor and documentary filmmaker discusses his favorite looks, including the tie pin he stole from the 'Mad Men' set.",f2558987-b39e-532b-bdd3-1e87a1c6b666,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/06/fashion/06LIST3/06LIST3-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=5baae559a90e0c183d780e2bf9afaa1bcdaf74df1bb44e93e6ea2c2d84ae4499&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The actor Colin Hanks said he was never into high fashion: ""Generally, I like brands that have a story.""",f2558987-b39e-532b-bdd3-1e87a1c6b666,N24News/imgs/f2558987-b39e-532b-bdd3-1e87a1c6b666.jpg,19
Economy,"Workers Organize, but Don't Unionize, to Get Protection Under Labor Law",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/07/business/economy/nonunion-employees-turn-to-work-site-committees-for-protection.html,"Luis Munoz, left, and Jorge Porras in front of the Squeaky Clean Car Wash in Santa Fe, N.M. The two were fired after they sent the company a list of grievances.

SANTA FE, N.M. -- Jorge Porras used to report to his carwash job here most mornings at 8:15 a.m., but he said that his boss often did not let him clock in until 11, when customers frequently began streaming in. Many days he was paid for just six hours, he said, even though he worked nine and a half hours. One day, when the heavy chain that pulled cars forward got stuck, Mr. Porras tried to fix it, but it suddenly lurched forward and cut off the top of his right ring finger. The injury caused him to miss work for the next two weeks, he said, but he received no pay or workers' compensation for the forced time off. Mr. Porras and nine co-workers became so fed up that they took an unusual step. They formed a workers committee (not a labor union) and sent a certified letter to the owner of the carwash. In it, they complained about being ""insulted and humiliated"" in ""front of our co-workers and customers"" and protested being required to work off the clock and not being given goggles or gloves even though they worked with toxic chemicals. An advocacy group for immigrant workers, Somos Un Pueblo Unido, advised Squeaky Clean's workers to set up such a committee because the National Labor Relations Act -- enacted under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1935 -- prohibits employers from retaliating against workers for engaging in ""concerted"" activity to improve their wages and conditions, even when they are not trying to unionize.

In an era when the traditional labor unions envisioned by Depression-era supporters of that law have weakened steadily, many advocates now see work site committees as an alternative way to strengthen workers' clout and protections. Simon Brackley, president of the Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce, said Somos had exaggerated the prevalence of wage violations and had been too quick to pounce on employers. But Somos is not backing down, and many worker groups are now copying its work site committee idea, which has been adopted at about 35 restaurants, hotels and other companies in Santa Fe. ""A lot of workers don't know about labor unions, and a lot are scared of retaliation if they try to form one,"" said Marcela Diaz, the executive director of Somos Un Pueblo Unido (We are a United People). ""So we have to find ways to protect workers when there isn't a union."" Santa Fe may be a famously artsy, liberal community, Ms. Diaz said, but many businesses too readily take advantage of their immigrant employees. Luis Munoz, a co-worker at the Squeaky Clean Car Wash, said their boss frequently humiliated workers, sometimes shouting, ""You're good for nothing."" One winter day, Mr. Munoz said, the boss -- complaining that cars were not being washed faster -- soaked him with bone-chilling water from a hose.

""We knew we'd have little protection if we acted alone,"" Mr. Porras, an immigrant from Guatemala, said in Spanish. ""But we knew that if we formed a committee, we'd be protected."" Ultimately, the labor board ordered Squeaky Clean to reinstate the workers and pay $6,000 in back wages. The carwash agreed separately to pay $60,000 to settle claims for minimum wage and overtime violations. The workers say that, in response to the worker committee's pressure, the carwash has improved conditions for those who complained (but not necessarily for the rest of the crew) -- paying them for their full eight hours and giving a one-hour lunch break and one-week paid vacation. Jay Ritter, Squeaky Clean's owner, did not respond to telephone messages seeking comment. These newfangled worker committees have been accumulating victories. In recent years, workers at 12 New Mexico companies have complained to the N.L.R.B. that they were fired for pushing to improve conditions. In 11 of those cases, the labor board's Phoenix office found that the firings had been unlawful and pressed for the workers' reinstatement.

* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations. ""A lot of people thought the National Labor Relations Act could be used only during unionization campaigns,"" said Andrew Schrank, a labor relations specialist who recently became a professor at Brown University after teaching at the University of New Mexico. ""They're finding that the National Labor Relations Act is much more expansive than many people thought.""

Richard F. Griffin Jr., the labor board's general counsel, said a 1962 Supreme Court case -- involving a spontaneous walkout because a factory was so cold -- makes clear that the National Labor Relations Act protects nonunion workers, too. ""It's important that people understand that the law applies to all private sector workplaces and protects activity outside the context of union activity,"" Mr. Griffin said. Somos's success has impressed officials at many of the nation's 230 immigrant worker centers. ""We're looking at taking some of these steps,"" said Adam Kader, director of the Arise Chicago Worker Center. ""We urge workers to form committees with as many people as possible. We know three people out of 20 at a workplace is much better than one out of 20."" To the relief of business, labor specialists say these committees will rarely if ever be as effective as traditional unions, which are larger and engage in collective bargaining. Somos, a 20-year-old immigrants' advocacy group, originally focused on persuading New Mexico lawmakers to let immigrants without legal papers obtain driver's licenses. That effort succeeded. The group has since found a fresh calling, fighting for immigrants who face workplace problems, sometimes by staging raucous protests after workers filed claims alleging wage theft or illegal firings. ""We feel that the group's tactics are over the top,"" said Carol Wight, chief executive of the New Mexico Restaurant Association. ""I think there are nicer, more effective ways of getting what you want -- achieving justice for workers."" She said most restaurants tried to comply with labor laws, but New Mexico has various overlapping minimum wage laws that can make compliance difficult. Luis Munoz, left, and Jorge Porras were advised by Somos Un Pueblo Unido. Mark Holm for The New York Times Glenn Spencer, executive director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Workforce Freedom Initiative, voiced concern that some immigrant worker groups like Somos were fronts for unions and were being used to help rebuild the labor movement.

Ms. Diaz said Somos was not fronting for unions, adding that they had shown scant interest in organizing low-wage immigrant workers in New Mexico. ""It's hard to form unions,"" acknowledged Mike Archuleta, immediate past president of the Northern New Mexico Central Labor Council. ""If these workers could join a union, I would prefer that. But as far as protecting their own rights, these worker committees are the next best thing."" Four hotel housekeepers at the Holiday Inn Express in Los Alamos were fired after forming a workers committee and complaining to management about harsh treatment, favoritism and unfair punishments. A federal judge ordered them reinstated with $11,375 in back pay. A receptionist at the hotel said there was no one to discuss the case. One of the first cases involved 19 janitors for the Santa Fe school system who formed a workers committee in 2008 because they were upset that a supervisor was repeatedly harassing female workers, they said. The committee contacted the cleaning contractor that employed them, Merchants Building Maintenance, and pressed it to take action. That supervisor soon retired, but the next year, the contractor refused to rehire the committee's 19 members, while rehiring almost everyone else. After extensive litigation, a labor board judge ordered that the employees be reinstated, and the janitors received $130,000 in back pay. The janitors were never rehired because the company lost its contract with the school system. Merchants Building Maintenance did not respond to inquiries. Three workers at Posa's El Merendero restaurant here said they were fired after sending a letter asking management to discuss their concerns: not being paid for attending a 5 a.m. monthly meeting, not being paid when they worked through lunch, and often not being paid time and a half for overtime.

""If I were to do this on my own, they would just fire me and that would have been the end of it,"" said Mayte Flores, a cook who lost her job. ""When we wrote the letter together, we were able to protect ourselves."" The N.L.R.B. ordered the restaurant to rehire the workers. Jeff Posa, the restaurant's co-owner, criticized Somos and defended his actions. ""I can't say anything positive about them,"" he said, asserting that the group incites workers to attract members and membership fees. Somos's membership fee is $20. Mr. Posa said the fired workers had provoked heated arguments in the kitchen with co-workers. ""I don't want to have people that are upset making my food,"" he said. ""That's not good for my workers or my customers."" Mr. Porras, the carwash worker, said the campaign was having ripple effects across the city. ""I'm helping other workers,"" he said. ""People in Santa Fe are less willing to abuse workers because they see workers are standing up for their rights.""","As unions have weakened, work site committees offer an alternative that is easier to form and can guard workers' rights and improve job conditions.",145be0b2-8417-5dc1-8747-70881a621cb2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/05/business/05somos/05somos-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=eb3d43ab99313b1d241f35c23e111f88fb2bf418ce02d3d2e9d2bdb13512afed&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Luis Muñoz, left, and Jorge Porras in front of the Squeaky Clean Car Wash in Santa Fe, N.M.

Your Money,How to Get Rich by Buying a Franchise (Really),https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/your-money/franchise.html,"Dan Gagne has been a plumber for three decades, but it has been years since he held a wrench. He has built a plumbing business in the Bay Area that generates $20 million a year in revenue and employs 100 people. The money his empire brings in allows him and his family to pursue other interests. ""The income is more than I'd ever imagined,"" Mr. Gagne, 54, said. ""I own several homes. We've invested in eight acres in Costa Rica and are going to build a health spa. We live there about six months of the year."" He credited his wealth not to his skill as a plumber but to his being part of a national franchise, Benjamin Franklin Plumbing. Franchises are promoted as a way to control your destiny and build wealth by getting a head start, as well as guidance in good times and bad, from the franchiser that created or controls the concept.

But when an economic cycle is at its height, there's a risk that people will move too fast into a new franchising concept and not do enough due diligence, which could lead to a dream of wealth turning into a nightmare of loss in a recession. Just since 2012, about 1,740 brands have tried the franchise model, according to FRANdata, a company that tracks and advises the industry. Opportunities include Sir Grout, which specializes in grout, tile and wood restoration, and Shack Shine, a house detailing service. The costs for many of these concepts typically range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars (although a single McDonald's location tops out at $2.2 million). But the comparatively low barrier to entry can cloud the risk assessment for entrepreneurs. Franchises are often promoted as businesses that fare well in a recession, but Darrell Johnson , chief executive of FRANdata, said the research did not support that. (A new report from the National League of Cities found that two-thirds of city finance officials expect a recession as soon as next year.) ""Franchising is not an industry,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""What you're really asking is, what industries are more or less susceptible to downturns? And within those industries, what's the presence of franchises?""

If someone is inclined to buy a franchise, whether for the independence or the wealth, a cleareyed view of what is being pitched is important. Here are some questions to consider. For starters, analysts say, investors should ask whether the underlying industry is growing. But even in growth areas, not every franchise is a winner. Franchising, like the economy, is cyclical. Data shows that the top growth areas for franchising include fitness centers, children's educational programs and the general health sector; food, as a broad category, is ebbing. Potential buyers should look carefully at federal disclosure forms that are required for franchises, paying particular attention to Item 19, which addresses the return on investment and the unit economics, said Jeff Johnson , founder and chief executive of the Franchise Research Institute. The second big factor is whether branding will matter. Darrell Johnson of FRANdata said most people know their primary physician's name but probably not the name of the doctor's medical practice. Yet in an emergency, people are highly unlikely to ask for a doctor by name, relying instead on the reputation of the hospital or ambulatory care center. Branding counts in some franchise areas, too, like home health services. ""Senior care is one sector where branding matters,"" he said. ""It's hard to arrange something if I'm six states away. But there could be a consistency and expectation around a certain type of senior care."" Do you have a winning idea of your own? A better opportunity to create wealth may be to become the franchiser by setting up a business that creates and manages your concept and collects fees from licensing and revenue.

Coming out of the 2008 recession, Mr. Gagne followed the franchising company's direction on marketing and creating efficient systems. And that, he said, helped take his business from $5 million in revenue in the downturn to $11 million in 2011 and double that today. ""Could I have done this on my own?"" he asked. ""Probably not. I would not have gotten all the knowledge that I've gotten."" Unless the brand is already widely known, like 7-Eleven or Midas, what the franchisees receive in support from corporate headquarters can determine whether they build wealth. The most successful franchises focus on technology and systems that create a repeatable experience for consumers, said John Carter , chief executive of Vonigo, which specializes in technology for mobile franchises like pet grooming and massage therapy. ""There's a difference between a technician -- someone with expertise in a certain field -- and someone who has business expertise,"" Mr. Carter said. ""Just because someone is a great mover doesn't mean they should be building a moving franchise."" An entrepreneur needs to have some experience before starting a franchise. ""It's the business elements that count the most: sales, marketing, finance, technology, systems, human resources and who you have on your team,"" he said.

George Saldana has been an electrician for 42 years. In 2006, he bought a Mr. Sparky franchise. He credits the franchiser's technology for his moving from a business that paid him well to one that has created wealth for him and his family. ""We spent the last five years developing our propriety process to run our business in San Antonio,"" Mr. Saldana said. By being able to modify the franchise system, he said, he kept better track of service calls and provided service records to his technicians showing repairs that had been done and upgrades that were needed. There are downsides, including the risk that the franchiser may not be well run. Jeff Johnson of Franchise Research said he had been an area developer for Schlotzsky's Deli, a chain that grew after an initial public offering in 1995 to more than 750 locations before filing for bankruptcy in 2004. Franchisees lost all the wealth they had accumulated in the company's stock. To avoid this trap, he said, potential investors need to ask: ""Do you believe the franchiser is looking ahead and around the corner when it comes to the competition, the economy, changes in customer tastes?"" ""The best franchise opportunity may not be the one that makes the best hamburger,"" he said. ""It could be the one with the best purchasing, marketing and buying power. No one thinks a McDonald's hamburger is the best, but McDonald's has systems driven by technology: You're getting the same experience at any location."" In addition to the financial and franchise due diligence, Darrell Johnson said people should look for franchisees (not ones recommended by the franchiser) and ask them: ""Would they do it again? Are they interested in buying another one?""

Another risk is oversaturation of a concept in one area, like four frozen yogurt shops in one small town. Jeff Johnson said that even if those shops were all well run and received plenty of corporate support, there were only so many frozen yogurt fans to go around. ""You just can't have a fancy frozen yogurt stand on every corner,"" he said. ""When things tighten up, the strong will survive, but the ones that have problems with distribution and pricing will fail."" And the franchisees will fail with them. One way to mitigate this risk is to spread it around. Jeff Rahn invested in franchises in the Minneapolis area that focused on different essential services: heating and air-conditioning, electrical, and plumbing. Combined, their annual revenue is close to $12 million. ""All of them follow the same blueprint: no new construction and very little commercial work,"" he said.

Opinion,Google Gives Cover to Trump's Lies,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/opinion/google-covid-trump.html,"President Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic has been a case study in a management style marked by falsehoods and intimidation. Rather than risk inviting his ire, subordinates and fellow Republicans covered for him as he delayed a coordinated response to the coronavirus and it felled nearly 200 Americans. His political allies haven't been the only ones to fall into line. Just look at the way the president co-opted Google. While declaring the national emergency last Friday, President Trump announced that he had enlisted Google to create a broadly available website to help facilitate testing for the virus. He said that 1,700 engineers were working on the site and had ""made tremendous progress."" It sounded ambitious and promising. If only it were true. What followed were attempts by Google to placate the president and a mad scramble to get done what he'd said it was already doing.

Blindsided by the announcement, Google at first revealed that a subsidiary of its parent company known as Verily was working on a small-scale website initially intended only for health care workers in two Bay Area counties. The Verily site was being developed in coordination with Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, who was taken with the idea after speaking with Verily's chief executive, Andy Conrad, The New York Times reported. (It rolled out on Sunday but was immediately overwhelmed by people seeking testing.) But then Google pivoted and announced it was in fact also working on a new national informational coronavirus website. The saga could have ended there, but Mr. Trump instead lambasted the press for correctly reporting that Google initially had no plans for the website he described. And Google did nothing to correct the record, making itself complicit in his stoking of press mistrust. Mr. Trump asserted on Sunday that Google's national site was always the plan, while doubling down on his attack, saying, ""I don't know where the press got their fake news, but they got it someplace."" And he said Sundar Pichai, chief executive of Google-parent Alphabet, called to apologize, though he didn't clarify what he meant by that. Alphabet refused to confirm to The Times whether such a call even occurred or for what Mr. Pichai would need to apologize. And it declined to discuss the episode further. It's not the first time a technology company has bent to Mr. Trump's will. Apple's chief executive, Tim Cook, failed to correct Mr. Trump when he took credit in November for opening a Texas computer manufacturing plant that had been in operation since 2013.

Of course, Google and Apple are loath to cross a president whose administration is overseeing antitrust investigations of them. And his vendetta against Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post, most likely cost Amazon a roughly $10 billion government contract. Put simply, Mr. Trump's bullying often works. The Google flap lays bare his strong-arm tactics and the dangers of being complicit in his crusade against the media, particularly when Americans are trying to make sense of a mushrooming health crisis. Google's national site finally went live early Saturday morning, just over a week after Mr. Trump's surprise announcement. Comprising mostly links to other Google sites, like YouTube how-to videos for those working at home and video updates from the C.D.C., it does not help facilitate coronavirus testing, as Mr. Trump promised. Earlier, its limited Verily site raised concerns on Wednesday from a group of Democratic senators over data-collection practices that include potentially sharing personal health information with contractors, government agencies and other outside parties. Yes, it's commendable that Google ultimately committed to creating what may ultimately prove to be a valuable tool in combating the coronavirus. But as one of the world's most valuable and powerful companies, it should also come clean about the president's falsehoods. What the public needs is sober, forthcoming leadership, whether from Silicon Valley or from Washington. It needs a president who speaks accurately about the growing global crisis and works with industry transparently and decisively.","If one of the most powerful tech companies can't call out the president's dishonesty, who can?",221726b5-1270-5a5b-96a2-1dc4f5b11981,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/20/opinion/20googleWeb/20googleWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=e97af234d5be34b8db7ac44df27d8bd2f7209233eb2e82e73994f2f7fa83b1ec&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, last Friday showed a chart featuring a future national website that President Trump had said Google was preparing, although it wasn't.",221726b5-1270-5a5b-96a2-1dc4f5b11981,N24News/imgs/221726b5-1270-5a5b-96a2-1dc4f5b11981.jpg,11
Sports,"With Patchwork Pitching, the Padres Turn Another Page",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/03/sports/baseball/san-diego-padres.html,"When the San Diego Padres announced their first-round playoff roster Wednesday, it was hard not to look and think: Well, it was fun while it lasted. There were 14 pitchers among the 28 names, but not Mike Clevinger or Dinelson Lamet. Clevinger and Lamet are the Padres' aces, hard-throwing right-handers with wipeout sliders. They combined for a 2.17 earned run average in 10 September starts -- dominant until the moment their arms gave out. Clevinger went down with elbow impingement, Lamet with biceps tendinitis. Both tried to return for Padres' first playoff series in 14 years, but neither was ready. ""Those two guys are just phenomenal, the way they execute,"" said catcher Austin Nola, who joined the Padres in late August. ""But as soon as I came to this organization, I realized how many good arms we have."" On Friday, in the winner-take-all Game 3 of their series with the St. Louis Cardinals, the Padres used nine of those arms -- a different one each inning -- to survive. Their 4-0 victory was the first nine-man shutout in postseason history, a fitting end to a series in which no Padres pitcher worked more than two and a third innings in a game. The staff combined for 26 appearances to get 27 outs.

For the Padres, patchwork pitching fits with their postseason pedigree. When they won their first pennant, in 1984, the rotation averaged two innings per start in a five-game World Series mauling by the Detroit Tigers. At least the Padres looked good then -- or distinctive, anyway -- in their lively brown and gold uniforms. They dropped gold the next year and soon ditched brown for navy blue, with subsequent bland alterations underscoring the team's fading identity. The Padres won only one more pennant, in 1998, and finally revived their old colors this season. This year's team, pitcher Craig Stammen said on Friday, wants to make its own history and ""turn the page on maybe some struggles within the organization -- the blue Padres. Now we're the brown Padres, excited to build some new memories with the new colors.""

Stammen, 36, is the Padres' oldest player, a clubhouse leader who has learned to channel adrenaline since flopping in his first playoff experience, for Washington in 2012. On Friday Tingler trusted him with the first leg of an epic pitching relay, no matter his 5.63 regular-season E.R.A.

""We looked at numbers, we looked at other options, and we just gave it to a trustworthy man,"" Tingler said. ""How he was able to set the tone and get us out of there in an even game, when we hadn't done that yet -- it was huge, and I think it set the tone on the domino effect for the other guys coming in."" Stammen, a right-hander, retired the side in the top of the first. He gave way to a lefty, Tim Hill, with two outs in the second, and the right-handed Pierce Johnson bailed Hill out of a jam in the third. St. Louis never put another runner past second base, and closer Trevor Rosenthal, a former Cardinal, struck out the side in the ninth. Padres General Manager A.J. Preller acquired Rosenthal from Kansas City in August after losing Kirby Yates -- last year's major league leader in saves -- to elbow surgery. Preller also grabbed Nola and two relievers in an August deal with Seattle, part of a deadline haul in which Clevinger was thought to be the prize. Preller sent six players to Cleveland for Clevinger, tapping into the prospect depth he had built since taking over in August 2014. Five losing seasons followed, but this year the plan came together, with the highest-paid Padres -- Manny Machado, Eric Hosmer and Wil Myers -- all producing, and Fernando Tatis Jr. emerging as a magnetic star.

""The talent and energy is off the charts,"" Nola said of Tatis. ""You can watch it and it just brings everybody's energy level up when he's so enthusiastic to play the game."" That excitement has spread through San Diego, where the Chargers' departure in 2017 has left the Padres as the only major sports franchise in town. From the field, Hosmer said, the players could hear the fans cheering outside. The city has not won a championship since the Chargers ruled the American Football League in 1963. ""There would be nothing sweeter than to see this place sold out, to see the fans going crazy, to see good baseball being played in San Diego at Petco Park,"" Hosmer said. ""I know it's unfortunate they can't be in the stadium, but we definitely feel their energy."" Petco Park will continue to host playoff games this month, but in a cruel twist of this strange pandemic season, the Padres are leaving town. The rest of the postseason takes place in neutral sites, so the Padres will play in Arlington, Texas, for their best-of-five division series with the Los Angeles Dodgers starting Tuesday (Clevinger and Lamet, who both played catch on Friday, have not been ruled out). San Diego, as its team departs, will play host to the Yankees and the Tampa Bay Rays, and then the American League Championship Series.","To win their first postseason series in 14 seasons, San Diego relied on nine different pitchers and some thrilling young stars to dispatch the Cardinals.",eed54467-81a0-52ae-b1c9-88254064e7cc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/04/sports/04mlb-kepner1/merlin_177974919_5c93e6f9-685e-47ce-b880-cb082513d1f3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=ee88e124591aca70b992657a6f7a65c360db9678d302cde8606756e455755264&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Trevor Rosenthal embraced Austin Nola after finishing off the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 3 of their Wild Card series on Friday.,eed54467-81a0-52ae-b1c9-88254064e7cc,N24News/imgs/eed54467-81a0-52ae-b1c9-88254064e7cc.jpg,9
Real Estate,Shopping for Fireplace Tools,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/02/realestate/shopping-for-fireplace-tools.html,"Because the fireplace is usually the focal point of a room -- and all the furniture is arranged around it -- the accessories that go with it matter. Especially the fireplace tools, which not only need to look good, but are also used to tend the fire and clean up after.

""Nice fireplace tools are essential, but good ones are hard to find,"" said Steven Johanknecht, a founding partner of the Los Angeles-based design firm Commune.

A great set of tools, Mr. Johanknecht said, ""just finishes off the room, but too often it's something that people don't really consider.""

At Commune, ""almost every residential project we do has a fireplace,"" he said, and the firm's designers have used a wide variety of tools for homes ranging in style from Tudor to midcentury modern.

Food,Your Thanksgiving Helper? The Sous-Vide Machine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/08/dining/sous-vide-thanksgiving.html,"This Thanksgiving, charge your sous-vide machine with making the turkey breast, potatoes and sweet potatoes.





Picture any kitchen on Thanksgiving Day. There are dishes in the sink; every surface is covered with bowls, containers and cutting boards. In line for the oven are pies, turkey, casseroles and anything that needs reheating. On the burners, you've got gravy, cranberry sauce and mashed potatoes vying for space with the soup (whose idea was soup anyway?). Then, imagine a tiny corner of calm amid the chaos. A sous-vide machine, maybe perched on a chair so as not to take up any precious counter space, is simultaneously cooking a turkey breast and reheating your mashed potatoes. It can make life easier on the home cook's busiest day of the year. If you have a sous-vide machine, you're probably already versed in the delights of using it for steak, salmon, and ramen eggs with their silky, runny yolks.

Breaking it out on Thanksgiving is a holiday game changer. Not only will it cook a turkey breast conveniently and easily, but the results are better, juicier and more succulent and reliable than anything you can roast. And it does so conveniently and quietly, without adding to the already prodigious mess of the day.

But perhaps the greatest advantage to using sous vide to cook a turkey breast is that it eliminates one of the greatest Thanksgiving Day stresses, second only to wondering what your Great-Uncle Walter might say to stop the table conversation this year. I speak of the piercing, meat thermometer-doubting anxiety of ""did-I-over-or-undercook-the-turkey?"" Since white meat cooks faster than dark meat, the fear of drying out the breast meat is an annual reality. With sous vide, however, overcooking becomes impossible. The water will never get hotter than the temperature you set it to, which in my book should be 145 degrees for pink-tinged, tender morsels. In terms of food safety, 145 degrees is fine when using sous vide because the long, steady heat pasteurizes the meat.

Another benefit of sous vide is convenience. You can start your turkey breast in the morning and let it hang out there all day. Unlike traditionally roasted breast meat, it's ready when you are, not the other way around.

Now, I'm not saying that sous-vide turkey breast should necessarily replace your roasted bird (and nothing beats those crispy, bronzed bits around the turkey tail and wings). But if you're feeding a crowd and love leftovers, consider roasting a smaller whole turkey, and cooking an extra breast sous vide. Maneuvering a smaller bird in and out of the oven is less awkward than a 20-pounder, and it will roast more quickly, freeing up the coveted space for pie. Plus, a higher ratio of gorgeous, juicy breast meat means more sandwich-ready leftovers. (If you accidentally overcook the white meat of the roasted bird, it can still find a happy place in the soup pot.)

The only downside to sous vide poultry is soggy skin. I like to bake the turkey skin separately until it renders its fat and turns golden and crunchy. You can even do that on a baking sheet on the bottom of the oven while you reheat the green bean casserole. Once you've taken your sous-vide machine out of its box, you can also use it ahead of time for mashed potatoes and brown sugar sweet potatoes, then reheat both of them at the same time in the same pot while your turkey breast cooks. Note that the thinner you slice your potatoes, the more quickly they will cook. And make sure to poke several at the end, so you know they are all done. (Err on the side of overcooking here.) Sous-vide potatoes can sometimes cook unevenly, and making sure they are all very tender is important for a smooth, silky puree. Cooking a Thanksgiving meal can be as much of a yearly challenge as it is a joy. A sous-vide machine can lend a hand, in the most delectable way.

Style,"Roger Federer, Sneakerhead?",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/23/style/roger-federer-on-running-sneaker-deal.html,"If you run into Roger Federer on your way to board a plane, do not be surprised if he looks you up and down, or mostly down. That's because Mr. Federer has something of a sneaker fixation. The Swiss tennis champion is not an ""obsessive,"" he said (slightly hard to believe about someone who has won 20 Grand Slam trophies), but still he is ""always looking at other people's feet in airports."" Earlier this month, when Mr. Federer was in London to play in the ATP Finals, he said in an interview that he owns at least 250 pairs of sneakers. Then, pulling on a burnt orange pair with terra cotta laces and distinctive hollow little pods that ran the length of the soles, he acknowledged that that was probably a conservative estimate, given all the shoes he has from past matches. So, realistically, double? Possibly, he said with a grin. Mr. Federer, 38, would go on to lose the ATP semifinals, to the eventual winner, Stefanos Tsitsipas, a 21-year-old born the same year Mr. Federer played his first professional tennis game.

Pundits have been predicting Mr. Federer's retirement for almost a decade. For nearly as long, he has defied their expectations. Lately, however, despite stressing that he is far from finished playing, Mr. Federer has started to talk more openly about what comes next. That's where a company called On comes in. Switzerland, birthplace of both Mr. Federer and On, is often associated with fine chocolate, luxury watches and private bankers. The country ""is known for money and for passion but not always for innovation,"" said Caspar Coppetti, a founder of On. ""It can be quite a conservative place."" Mr. Federer has become an investor in, as well as a contributing product designer and representative for, the brand, which was started in 2010 in Zurich. You may not recognize the name immediately (Googling it can be tricky) but you may recognize its cult range of Cloud shoes, which feature an ""On"" light switch logo, a little Swiss flag and an odd-looking multi-globular cushioned rubber sole. (The patented technology, called CloudTec, gives runners a soft landing but springy takeoff.) After growing by word of mouth among endurance athletes and Olympians, and in running specialty stores, On is gaining ground as an underdog rival to giants like Nike and Adidas in the performance sports shoe category.

""Fans seem to think of us as an athletes' insider secret,"" said Olivier Bernhard, a duathlon and Ironman champion and one of On's three founders, over salad at the company's bustling Zurich headquarters. But in Germany, the Cloud has become the second most-sold sneaker after Nike's Air Max 270, according to NPD, a research firm; in America, now On's largest market, increasingly the shoes are a mainstay of gym floors on the East and West coasts. Fashion figures like J.W. Anderson wear Clouds; so do Hollywood types like Will Smith, John Malkovich and Emma Stone (the company said it does not pay people to wear its products). When Mr. Bernhard and his co-founders, Mr. Coppetti and David Allemann, considered next steps and bringing on a new partner, their thoughts turned to the most famous Swiss person in the world.

Instead, they likely think of his championships, two-decade-long career and huge global fan base. Still, a close friendship with Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue, has honed an interest in the fashion world, and Mr. Federer has graced his fair share of Met Gala red carpets, magazine covers and runway front rows. ""I learned to embrace personal style a while ago, both on and off the court,"" Mr. Federer said, noting that sneakers were increasingly a part of men's style. After a decades-long sponsorship agreement with Nike ended in 2018, Mr. Federer signed an apparel contract with Uniqlo reportedly worth $300 million. He has signed numerous other brand partnerships, including with Rolex, Moet & Chandon, Mercedes-Benz, Rimowa, NetJets and Credit Suisse. Among the timepieces, luggage, bubbly and luxury conveyances, however, there was an opening in footwear. Mr. Federer had originally met the On founders over dinner two years ago, several years after he had first noticed how many people in Switzerland were wearing their shoes.

Mr. Federer also has some hometown pride: ""We like it when little Swiss guys make a move on the big international stage."" Mr. Federer started to wear Ons for his sprints training, and has been building a relationship with the brand ever since. Even before anything was signed by him or his longtime agent Tony Godsick, Mr. Federer said, he had been going to the On office every time he was in Zurich to give feedback on product colors and cuts, growth ideas and marketing. (He is building his family a lakeside residence that is about a 25-minute drive away from the headquarters for when he retires from professional tennis.) Federer-designed products are already in the pipeline for next year, and he will represent the brand publicly, though he also ticked off other responsibilities. ""Brand building and global marketing,"" he said. ""How to connect with fans across cultures. And I think I can motivate employees from a leadership perspective too, on how to stay humble but dream big."" Neither Mr. Federer, who is the highest paid tennis player in the world, with a net worth estimated to be around $450 million, nor the On founders, would specify the financial terms of the deal.

Mr. Federer's arrival at On comes at an important time in the evolution of both the brand and the 50-year-old global sneaker market, where, historically, so-called performance categories (tennis, running, basketball, cross-training) have driven industry growth. According to its founders, On has been profitable since 2014. Its sneakers are sold in 55 countries, there are almost 500 employees, and the company has also started producing all day, hiking and trail running footwear, as well as sports apparel. For the past four years, however, the popularity of performance shoes has been dwindling. In their place are sports lifestyle shoes -- sports-inspired or fashion-forward sneakers that are not intended for sports use -- which are set to become the largest footwear category in the United States, according to NPD. Matt Powell, a senior industry adviser on sports for NPD, said that, for now at least, On appears to be bucking that trend. ""Many people are no longer in need of expensive and highly technical sneakers -- they just want to look good,"" Mr. Powell said. ""But there are still tens of millions of people out there who are runners who do want those types of shoes, and increasingly want unique brands that others don't have."" On, he said, is catering to that crowd. ""But the signature On aesthetic -- which is very design forward -- has also appealed to tastemakers from the sneaker community,"" he said. ""It's pretty clear it wants to be more than a niche running brand.""

It may not rank in the booming sneaker resale market, or feature in the most hyped of sneaker drops, but On's position at the intersection of fashion, performance and outdoor lifestyles mean it is gaining traction with a casually attired, digitally connected and health-conscious professional class. Which is where Mr. Federer -- and possibly much of his fan base -- come in. ""Sometimes, as an athlete of a certain age, you can feel like a falling star,"" Mr. Federer said. ""You can almost feel your image and success fading."" In the past, he said, he never used to want to dwell on life after tennis. ""Now,"" he said, ""it feels good committing to what will come next.""","The 20-time Grand Slam tennis champion is taking a big step toward life after tennis with On, a small Swiss running shoe brand with a cult following and global ambitions.",fff0c3b7-80f4-55fc-9786-610e444e08ca,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/24/fashion/23FedererOnRunning-roger-federer/23FedererOnRunning-roger-federer-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=d13530749b6059226a6efefeb18be1f0e33a6185190fd17e8a66342aeb299aba&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Roger Federer in London getting hands-on with his new investment, the Swiss sneaker company On.",fff0c3b7-80f4-55fc-9786-610e444e08ca,N24News/imgs/fff0c3b7-80f4-55fc-9786-610e444e08ca.jpg,15
Theater,Review: A World of Cardsharps and Zoom Dupes in 'The Future',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/theater/The-future-review.html,"When a used-car salesman says, ""I will be honest,"" it's a sure sign he won't be.

Same with a card huckster. For him, ""I will be honest"" means ""Don't look at my hands."" Other tells may include ""You saw for yourself that this deck was legitimately shuffled."" (It wasn't.) Or ""I want this to be as fair as possible."" (Watch your wallet.)

All of these are part of Helder Guimaraes's patter in ""The Future,"" a Zoom magic show from the Geffen Playhouse trying very hard to be more -- but only partly succeeding. Oddly, it's the magic part that most disappoints, at least as theater. The ""more"" part, a stretch toward greater meaning, is engaging even as you wonder if it too is a deception.

That stretch comes between card tricks, as Guimaraes offers glimpses of his life's journey from fanboy to sorcerer's apprentice to fast hand for hire. The tension between entertainment and crookery that's built into the business eventually grows into a full-blown dilemma when he meets his childhood idol in Marseille.

The idol, a British cardsharp named Kevin who presents himself as a reformed gambler, at first fulfills Guimaraes's teenage fantasies. Kevin seems to be the kind of man who would ply his trade in purple rooms with velour curtains and Venetian landscapes on the wall.","In his latest magic show, Helder Guimarães shuffles an old genre into a new technology with mixed results.",26d6489a-e0ee-5c55-a087-ae614f7e5bee,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/14/arts/14future-1/14future-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Helder Guimarães in ""The Future,"" his Zoom magic show for the Geffen Playhouse.",26d6489a-e0ee-5c55-a087-ae614f7e5bee,N24News/imgs/26d6489a-e0ee-5c55-a087-ae614f7e5bee.jpg,10
Economy,"Job Growth Steady in July, Possibly Easing Path for Fed Action",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/business/economy/jobs-report-july-unemployment-hiring-wages.html,"The American economy delivered pretty much what was expected last month in terms of hiring, giving the Federal Reserve one more piece of evidence that conditions are strong enough to support an increase in the interest rate. The pace of employment growth was steady, if not spectacular; the economy added 215,000 jobs in July. While not as robust as the gains recorded in May and June, Friday's Labor Department report came in within 10,000 jobs of what forecasters had predicted, a notable feat of consistency in an economy that employs nearly 150 million people. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.3 percent. If the current pace of job growth can be maintained, economists expect the jobless rate to sink below the crucial 5 percent level by late 2015 or early 2016. With the job market generally moving in the right direction, the Fed is likely to stay the course in its plans to raise short-term interest rates soon. Fed officials haven't given a definitive signal, but they've indicated that a rate increase is possible at the next Fed meeting in September or at their last meeting of the year in December.

""Solid enough to keep the September hike alive,"" said Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics, in a note to clients shortly after the release of the data. Although the initial increase will be small, short-term interest rates have been near zero since late 2008. The Fed dropped rates to historically low levels during the depths of the financial crisis in a bid to stimulate growth and stave off panic. The Fed controls short-term interest rates, rather than the longer-term benchmarks like 10-year bond yields that help determine rates on mortgages, so ordinary Americans won't feel much of an impact at first.

In fact, consumers could actually benefit from an increase in what's known as the federal funds target rate as it filters through the financial markets and causes yields on checking accounts and money market deposits to rise, according to Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco. But the slow reversal of years of easy credit by the central bank has markets on edge, with traders and investors having grown used to very cheap borrowing costs. ""It comes down to a shift in policy, and this will be a watershed event,"" Mr. Anderson said. ""Investors are looking beyond the first rate hike to where rates will be two, three or four years down the road.""

Despite the overall healthy tone of Friday's report, areas of weakness remain. Wage growth has been sluggish. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent in July, also about what was expected and better than comparable figures in June, when wages were flat. Over the last 12 months, wages have risen at an annual rate of 2.1 percent, not much more than the already-low underlying rate of inflation. The situation helps explain why many workers remain frustrated with what has been a fitful recovery. The proportion of Americans in the work force also did not bounce back in July after declining in recent months. At 62.6 percent, it remains at levels not seen since the late 1970s. The Labor Department's broadest measure of unemployment, which includes people working in part-time positions because they can't find full-time jobs, declined 0.1 percentage point to 10.4 percent.

The mining and logging sector lost 4,000 jobs, a sign of the pain in the oil patch as energy companies cut drilling and other exploration efforts. The public sector added 5,000 jobs, while private employers increased payrolls by 210,000. The strongest areas for hiring included health care, retailing and professional and business services. Manufacturers added 15,000 jobs in July, the biggest monthly increase for the sector since late 2014. After years of slow gains, healthy consumer demand is finally persuading management at some factories to take the plunge and build up their work forces. In Morganton, N.C., Ekornes, a furniture maker, plans to hire 10 more workers by the end of 2015, bringing employment at its factory to about 50, said Peter Bjerregaard, president of North American operations for Ekornes. Like many manufacturing jobs, the new positions at the Ekornes factory pay a bit more than comparable jobs at nearby stores or restaurants. Workers earn $15 to $25 an hour and receive a generous benefits package.

Although more positive in recent days, economic data over the last few months has been uneven, with better numbers for trade and factory orders, but a lackluster overall growth rate recorded in the spring. These crosscurrents made the report on the labor market eagerly anticipated by traders and investors on Wall Street. Over all, the tone was slightly better than expected. The Labor Department also revised upward the number of jobs added in May and June by a total of 14,000, bringing the average monthly gain over the last three months to 235,000. The average workweek also grew slightly, another sign of economic momentum after a slow start to the year. ""This is very supportive of a September rate hike by the Fed,"" said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""At this stage, the Federal Reserve is looking for confirmation. They don't need to see additional strength, and this report pushes them one step closer."" The snapshot provided monthly by the Labor Department is of course prone to revision, and even the economists who track it closely each month warn that a difference of 50,000 or so jobs has only limited statistical significance in an economy where gross domestic product stands at roughly $17 trillion.","With the central bank assessing the labor market as it considers raising rates, the economy added 215,000 jobs and unemployment stayed at 5.3 percent.",936b7a45-953b-5abc-9048-8c1e4187d455,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/08/business/0808-BIZJOBS/0808-BIZJOBS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=dd6194bf760cc86e5535bef1300d643f7a9e821211d6b3d41964465594db4c80&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Workers at the World Trade Center PATH station.,936b7a45-953b-5abc-9048-8c1e4187d455,N24News/imgs/936b7a45-953b-5abc-9048-8c1e4187d455.jpg,8
Art & Design,Metropolitan Museum of Art to Reopen Five Days a Week in August,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/arts/design/met-museum-reopening-plans.html,"The Metropolitan Museum of Art announced on Wednesday that its landmark location on Fifth Avenue will welcome visitors five days a week, Thursday through Monday, when it reopens to the public on Aug. 29.

The museum, which had not been closed for more than three days in a row in over 100 years before it was forced to shut down in March because of the coronavirus pandemic, has prepared for the reopening by devising safety protocols for visitors and staff that follow the guidelines formulated by the Centers for Disease Control and the government. Face coverings will be required in the museum, and social distancing will be encouraged. The number of visitors will also be capped at 25 percent of the facility's maximum capacity.

""The safety of our staff and visitors remains our greatest concern,"" Daniel H. Weiss, the museum's president and chief executive, said in a statement.

Three new exhibitions will be on display when the museum resumes operations late next month. ""Making the Met, 1870-2020"" will focus on the institution's history; ""Jacob Lawrence: The American Struggle"" will highlight a series by the modernist painter that surveys the formative history of the United States; and a new commission by Hector Zamora, ""Lattice Detour,"" will grace the building's roof garden. Visitors will be able to view the new exhibitions, and the museum's other treasures, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturdays, Sundays, and Mondays, and noon to 7 p.m. on Thursdays and Fridays.",Three new exhibitions will be on display when the museum's Fifth Avenue location begins welcoming visitors again on Aug. 29.,92329e30-d865-572c-a498-0595fb204686,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/15/arts/15met-item/merlin_172175682_994d720d-48a3-43f2-8253-e2f7f05f83a0-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=cd368f6325bc51a7ab2525c704c2e2f79d1b00e9cc456d61daf17f17510e4026&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Face coverings will be required inside the museum, and the number of visitors will be capped at 25 percent capacity.",92329e30-d865-572c-a498-0595fb204686,N24News/imgs/92329e30-d865-572c-a498-0595fb204686.jpg,14
Travel,"36 Hours in Boone, N.C. (and Environs)",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/travel/what-to-do-36-hours-in-boone-north-carolina.html,"Asheville, N. C. -- with its lively arts district, locavore food movement and over-the-top, Gilded Age mansion -- attracts hordes of leaf peepers as soon as the temperatures start to drop. But a two-hour drive up the spine of the Blue Ridge Mountains, the less-visited Boone, a gem of a college town in the heart of Southern Appalachia, offers many of the same attractions, and plenty more besides. Come for the fresh air and majestic mountain views, but stick around to sample the local brews, enjoy live music and admire the fine crafts of the area's talented artisans. The Blue Ridge Parkway is well worth the small detour for its historic sites and sweeping overlooks, while nearby Blowing Rock -- a genteel resort town long favored by well-to-do Southern tourists -- offers fine dining, swank boutiques and one of the most famous views in the state. For a high-quality, locally sourced meal in a warm and friendly setting, stop by F.A.R.M. Cafe on King Street. It's not obvious at first glance, but this easygoing diner, which attracts a mixed crowd of professor types, families and tourists, doesn't have fixed prices (although there is a suggested donation of $7 for a small plate and $10 for a large). The cafe's full name is Feed All Regardless of Means, and its goal is to eliminate hunger in North Carolina's High Country. The menu changes every day but always includes a home-cooked soup, main, two sides, salad, dessert and as much iced tea as you can handle. The forested bluffs of Elk Knob State Park might have been turned into a housing development had it not been for a group of concerned citizens who joined with the Nature Conservancy to purchase the land and hand it over to the state government in 2003. Now protected, the park's 4,200 acres are home to wild turkeys, bobcats and black bears, as well as flame azaleas, orchids and the rare Gray's lily. Get a close-up look at this high-mountain habitat along the 1.9-mile Summit Trail -- a steady, well-marked climb that leads you to the top of Elk Knob (5,520 feet) and rewards you with a panorama of the rolling Blue Ridge Mountains. The views are especially radiant in the first half of October, when the fiery autumn colors at this elevation usually reach their peak. On a clear day, you can catch a glimpse of Mount Mitchell, the highest mountain east of the Mississippi.

So hard to reach were the mountainous counties of northwestern North Carolina that lowlanders early in the state's history often called them ""the lost provinces,"" and the nickname stuck into the first half of the 20th century. Modern highways have solved the access problem, but the old moniker has been embraced by the owners of Lost Province, a popular brewery-cum-restaurant that opened in downtown Boone in 2014. The vaulted wooden interior welcomes friendly crowds of locals and visitors, who come to dine on the wood-fired pizza, enjoy the house-brewed beers and catch some live music (bluegrass, classic rock, folksy singer-songwriter sessions) on a Friday night. Dinner and drinks for two, about $50.

Start your morning with a cappuccino and blueberry scone from Stick Boy Bread Company, a popular bakery and coffee shop that offers a rotating selection of pastries, loaves, cakes and seasonal pies. Grab a stool by the window and gaze across the road at the source of Boone's youthful energy: Appalachian State University, where the student population of roughly 19,000 just exceeds the population of the town. Breakfast for two, about $12. Boone was named after the storied pioneer Daniel Boone, who hunted, fought and started a family in the area in the 18th century. Spend a couple of hours exploring the city's lively main drag, King Street, which still has a hint of frontier charm. Stop by the Mast General Store, which has just about everything you could need -- from hiking gear to kitchenware to dozens of varieties of hard candy. Browse the work of local potters at Doe Ridge Pottery, where you can watch the master potter at work in the back. Or explore the fine arts and crafts on display at Hands Gallery, which features the work of jewelers, painters, basket makers and other artists from the region. Look out for the bronze statue of Doc Watson with his trusty guitar, which he called ""Ol' Hoss,"" sitting on a bench on the corner of King Street and Depot Street. The celebrated musician, who died in 2012, was born a few miles down the road.

About a 20-minute drive from downtown Boone, The Blowing Rock (as distinct from the nearby, article-free town of Blowing Rock, which took its name from the famous local boulder) claims to be the oldest tourist attraction in North Carolina. Eighty-six years after its opening, the site -- a quarter-mile graded trail along the edge of a blustery cliff -- continues to draw plenty of visitors, who come to admire the far-reaching and easy-to-access views of some of the state's highest peaks. If you're not spooked by heights, you can dangle your legs off the Blowing Rock itself, where -- legend has it -- the strong wind once blew a Cherokee brave back into the arms of the woman who loved him. Entry, $7.

Just a few miles down the road, the vaulted Blowing Rock Art and History Museum houses a small but impressive selection of local art and artifacts (free entry). A number of paintings by the artist Philip Moose, a North Carolina native, are on permanent display, alongside an informative exhibition on the history of Blowing Rock and tourism in the area, which has long driven the town's economy. A colorful and thought-provoking exhibition on textiles and fiber art in the state runs through the end of October, to be followed by a retrospective on the work of Hugh Morton, one of North Carolina's most important photographers.

So on-brand is Blowing Rock that even the local bank and gas station display the town's classic native-stone exterior. The result makes for a pleasant wander -- from the manicured park at the heart of the town to the many high-end boutiques that line the local Main Street. Start at Neaco, where you can pick up modern decor and funky gifts, then wander down to Crown Gallery, which sells fine art from the region and beyond. Bolick and Traditions Pottery is worth a look for its brightly glazed ceramic dishware, while Windwood Antiques offers a wide array of vintage copperware, artwork and furniture. If you're feeling inspired, leave a note on Blowing Rock's public prayer tree, which overflows with messages from the many souls who have passed by. Blowing Rock's Inn at Ragged Gardens has been around for so long that the shingles covering the hotel's exterior are fashioned out of the bark of the once-widespread American chestnut. The hotel's woodsy feel extends to its popular restaurant, The Best Cellar, which offers fine dining in a cozy, fireplace-warmed dining room. Order the crispy-skinned roasted half duckling or the locally caught mountain trout, served with a white wine, butter and caper sauce. Reservations essential. Dinner and drinks for two, about $100.","A lively Appalachian college town, a genteel resort spot and stops along the Blue Ridge Parkway offer a colorful fall weekend of music, crafts, beer and majestic views.",5055fcfc-e99f-59a1-b677-9a42b4b1cccd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/03/travel/03Hours-Boone-NC4/merlin_161146428_74643bbd-8ff2-4742-8cdd-80f5d8a4a32a-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=3286d29f9c23e34ba21bda499c544d51cc7f9bd40760895e1c0045ceb82292bd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A view of downtown Boone, a college town in the heart of Southern Appalachia.",5055fcfc-e99f-59a1-b677-9a42b4b1cccd,N24News/imgs/5055fcfc-e99f-59a1-b677-9a42b4b1cccd.jpg,4
Health,Zika Virus Case in Utah Baffles Health Officials,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/19/health/utah-zika-case.html,"The mosquito that typically transmits Zika -- the Aedes aegypti -- does not usually range into northern Utah, but maps of the mosquito's range can be unreliable and experts say it is theoretically possible that it has made it there.

WASHINGTON -- In another puzzling twist to the Zika epidemic, the Utah Department of Health on Monday reported the diagnosis of a new case of the virus that did not appear to have been contracted through either of the known sources of transmission: a mosquito bite or sexual contact. The patient, who has fully recovered, was a ""family contact"" who helped care for an older man who had become infected with the virus after traveling abroad. That man, from Salt Lake County, died in June. He also had other ailments, and it was unclear whether the virus had contributed to his death.

The Zika virus has caused more than 1,500 cases of birth defects, mostly in Brazil, where the epidemic began last year. In the United States and its territories, several hundred pregnant women have been infected with the Zika virus, with the largest concentration in Puerto Rico; many had traveled to countries where the virus is circulating.

Zika is known to be transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito and through sex, but neither seemed to be a plausible explanation for what happened in Utah. The infected caregiver, who tended to the ailing man at home and in the hospital, had not traveled to a country where Zika is circulating and had not had sex with him, officials said. Local health workers had been trapping mosquitoes since last year, but had found no Aedes aegypti. Joseph Conlon, a technical adviser to the American Mosquito Control Association, said neither Aedes aegypti nor a cousin, Aedes albopictus, is found in Salt Lake County.

""We have found no evidence that mosquitoes here in Utah are transmitting the Zika virus,"" said Dr. Angela Dunn, the deputy state epidemiologist at the Utah Department of Health on a call with reporters. She said that for that reason the case was not a danger to the broader public. Zika has surprised scientists with its ability to be transmitted by sex -- both from men to women and, in a recent discovery in New York City, from women to men. But it is not known to be transmitted in any other way -- without the help of a mosquito -- so the Utah case is remarkable.

Disease sleuths are sifting through clues. The Utah man who died had a very high level of virus in his body, which may have increased the risk that his bodily fluids could infect others. But while the virus has been detected in blood, semen, vaginal fluid, saliva and urine, it had not been known to infect others through nonsexual contact. ""We don't have any evidence that suggests Zika can be passed from one person to another by sneezing or coughing or kissing or sharing utensils,"" said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has a team investigating the case. Dr. Frieden said other people who had come into contact with the Utah man were being tested. The results will take a few weeks. The continental United States has become a useful laboratory for unusual transmission of Zika. There has yet to be a local spread through mosquitoes, making sexual and other transmission easier to trace. There are more than 1,300 case of the Zika in the continental United States -- all acquired through travel abroad. ""This raises some interesting questions,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist in Tennessee. ""Was there a needle stick or injury? Or if not, possible contact with other bodily fluid like urine or saliva?""","A ""family contact"" of an infected man who died last month got the virus but has fully recovered.",f19b94c2-0c31-5a79-9bc1-27def9808564,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/19/science/19UTAH/19UTAH-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=dfad8f2b7693d47729cc3118a2627831542efef7dac113d9b3f66ecaf2ebcdda&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The mosquito that typically transmits Zika — the Aedes aegypti — does not usually range into northern Utah, but maps of the mosquito's range can be unreliable and experts say it is theoretically possible that it has made it there.",f19b94c2-0c31-5a79-9bc1-27def9808564,N24News/imgs/f19b94c2-0c31-5a79-9bc1-27def9808564.jpg,1
Real Estate,Views of the B.Q.E. and Beyond,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/realestate/views-of-the-bqe-and-beyond.html,"With the windows open at the Cobble Hill House, the sound of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, which the new condo building overlooks, is -- delicately put -- a constant roar. But close the triple-glazed, parlor-style windows and the condo units at 78 Amity Street, at the corner of Hicks Street, transform into quiet, light-filled spacious homes with fantastic East River views, just beyond the expressway. ""Incredible, right?"" said Deborah Rieders, a broker at the Corcoran Group, who is marketing the property. The firm launched sales this week for the 27-unit building, which includes one- to three-bedroom homes priced between $725,000 to $3.675 million. Developed by Vega Management, the 5-story brick building was designed by CWB Architects and the interior designs were done by the Meshberg Group.

Each unit will have access to a basement storage unit and underground parking spaces can be purchased for $150,000. The building will have a common roof deck facing the Cobble Hill Historic District, a fitness center, a children's playroom, and a virtual doorman. The sole commercial space, facing Hicks Street, is already occupied by the Brooklyn Preschool of Science, operated by Carmelo Piazza, better known as Carmelo the Science Fellow. (The preschool refers to this site as its Brooklyn Heights location, it also has schools on Wykoff Street in Cobble Hill and in Park Slope.) Ms. Rieders said monthly common charges for a medium-sized three-bedroom unit (about 1,450-square-feet) would be about $600, which is low relative to many other high-end condo buildings that charge thousands of dollars in monthly fees. ""This building has simple, classic finishes and aims to attract clients that might be priced out of certain buildings because of really high common charges,"" she said. ""It's high-end, in a low-key way.""

At the Polhemus Residences, a prewar building on the corner of Amity and Henry Streets that was converted to 17 condo units, only one $3.5 million, three-bedroom unit is left for sale, according to Alexander Maroni, a Douglas Elliman broker. Half of the eight adjacent townhomes, priced between just under $6 million to $8.4 million, that are collectively called the Pohlemus Townhouses, are also under contract. Brokers said that new, turnkey homes built in Cobble Hill are selling quickly, in part because of its proximity to Brooklyn Bridge Park. ""The park is like the Brooklyn version of the High Line,"" Mr. Maroni said. Phase two of River Park involves three buildings. A 15-story, 25-unit condo building at 347 Henry Street will likely be completed by the end of 2019, according to Jonathan Landau, chief executive of Fortis Property Group, the developer. The majority of the homes will be three-bedroom units, catering to families with children. The building will have an outdoor swimming pool and two outdoor decks. Mr. Landau said he hoped 91 Pacific Street, a 36-story tower with 103 units will be completed by early 2021. This building will have a mix of studio to four-bedroom homes and a 25,000-square-foot common roof deck. There will also be a 19-story, 48-unit condo building at 350 Hicks Street , at the corner of Atlantic Avenue, with parking spaces and a private early education school on the lower floors. This building will be tailored to have ""a livelier feel for a younger clientele,"" with a cafe in the lobby area that will turn into a bar at night, Mr. Landau said.

The current emergency room operated by New York University Langone Health at 83 Amity Street will move into a new building on Atlantic Avenue that will be built by Fortis. Once the new medical facility is up and running, a new building with a private K-12 school on the lower levels and a condo tower above will be built on the current site, Mr. Landau said. The future of the former hospital site has been contentious since the state announced the hospital's closure in 2013. Most recently, the Cobble Hill Association and local politicians have helped form a construction task force that meets every four to six weeks to monitor construction and address neighborhood concerns. Amy Breedlove, president of the nonprofit, said she believed the task force has helped keep Fortis and government agencies like the Department of Transportation and Buildings accountable. ""We would like the neighborhood's concerns to be heard and met,"" she said, describing the talks so far as productive. She estimated Cobble Hill has a population of about 8,000 people, and River Park, once finished, will add another two thousand or more. ""You have to look at the impact on the neighborhood over the long term,"" she said. Mr. Landau said he believed ""the meetings have opened up a line of communication between all parties,"" and he added: ""There's always a back and forth and differences in opinion, but I think we're in a more stable place and it's my job to be attentive about neighborhood concerns.""

Music,"Philharmonic Players, Fired on Misconduct Grounds, Are Reinstated",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/arts/music/new-york-philharmonic-misconduct.html,"The New York Philharmonic has been forced by an arbitrator to reinstate two players it fired over allegations of unspecified sexual misconduct, the orchestra said on Monday night.

The Philharmonic dismissed the players -- its principal oboist, Liang Wang, and associate principal trumpet, Matthew Muckey -- in September 2018. Both men denied wrongdoing, and the players' union filed a grievance challenging their dismissals. The case was heard by an independent arbitrator, who found that the players had been terminated without just cause and should be reinstated.

""We are profoundly disappointed by the arbitrator's decision,"" the Philharmonic said in a statement, adding: ""While we obviously disagree with the arbitrator and stand by our original actions and decisions in this matter, we will, as we must, abide by the arbitrator's ruling and reinstate both players.""

The case was an example of how organized labor can struggle with sometimes conflicting interests as it grapples with a sharp uptick in misconduct cases in recent years.

Media,Why Tobacco Companies Are Paying to Tell You Smoking Kills,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/24/business/media/tobacco-companies-ads.html,"The biggest tobacco companies in the United States will start running prime-time television commercials and full-page ads in national newspapers on Sunday -- but the campaign is unlikely to spur enthusiasm for their products. ""More people,"" one ad says, ""die every year from smoking than murder, AIDS, suicide, drugs, car crashes, and alcohol, combined."" Another reads: ""Cigarette companies intentionally designed cigarettes with enough nicotine to create and sustain addiction."" Each ad starts by noting that Altria, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard and Philip Morris USA were ordered to make the statements by a federal court. The messages stem from a lawsuit brought by the Justice Department in 1999. As part of the 2006 ruling in the suit, which sought to punish cigarette makers for decades of deceiving the public about the dangers of their product, the companies were ordered to disseminate ""corrective statements"" centered on the health risks and addictive nature of smoking. But until now, they resisted through appeals and by wrangling over wording.

""It's both an important victory and a frustrating one,"" said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, who has worked on the case since 1999. The tobacco companies ""have spent millions of dollars and a decade of time resisting a court order that simply requires them to publish truthful facts about their products and their behavior,"" he said. Mr. Myers said the ads would be less effective than originally intended because fewer people read newspapers and watch television today. The tobacco companies, he said, also negotiated to not include the phrase ""here's the truth"" in the ads. Altria, which owns Philip Morris USA, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, declined to comment beyond an Oct. 2 release about the ads, which said it was working to make its business practices more responsible. Murray Garnick, the company's general counsel, said in the statement that ""includes communicating openly about the health effects of our products, continuing to support cessation efforts, helping reduce underage tobacco use and developing potentially reduced-risk products."" R. J. Reynolds, which is part of British American Tobacco with Lorillard, said in an email that the company was ""fully complying with its obligations under the court order."" The initial order came from a 1,600-page civil racketeering judgment from Judge Gladys Kessler that excoriated the tobacco industry for lying about and misrepresenting its products beginning in the 1950s. She said they had sought ""to make money with little, if any, regard for individual illness and suffering, soaring health costs or the integrity of the legal system.""

The corrective statements were meant to appear in places that tobacco companies had ""historically used to promulgate false smoking and health messages."" In addition to the TV and newspaper ads, there will be messaging on the packs themselves and on the company's websites, though details are still being worked out.
* $15 minimum wage for federal contractors will take effect Jan. 30.
* Jeff Bezos gives $100 million to the Obama Foundation. ""I certainly don't think that what we have finally ended up with is really in the spirit of the original ruling,"" said Ruth Malone, a professor of nursing and public health policy at the University of California, San Francisco, who consulted for the Justice Department in the case. ""The original ruling was so that the American public would understand that they had been deceived through multiple means about whether smoking caused disease, whether smoking killed people, whether secondhand smoke caused disease, whether nicotine was addictive,"" she said. Proposed versions of the ads in 2011 appeared tougher. One said: ""We told Congress under oath that we believed nicotine is not addictive. We told you that smoking is not an addiction and all it takes to quit is willpower. Here's the truth: Smoking is very addictive. And it's not easy to quit. We manipulated cigarettes to make them more addictive."" Tobacco companies argued that the initially proposed statements were ""forced public confessions"" designed to ""shame and humiliate them."" They also said the statements were unnecessary after a 2009 law gave the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco products. The campaign that will begin on Sunday includes five different ads with statements divided by category, such as the ""manipulation of cigarette design and composition to ensure optimum nicotine delivery"" and ""adverse health effects of exposure to secondhand smoke."" Other statements include ""Secondhand smoke causes lung cancer and coronary heart disease in adults who do not smoke"" and ""Smoking kills, on average, 1,200 Americans. Every day."" Full-page ads will run online and in the Sunday issues of more than 40 newspapers, including The New York Times, on five separate days. There are also five versions of the commercials, which will run for a year on CBS, ABC and NBC in the evenings on Monday through Thursday. The spots feature a voice reading a statement as the text appears on the screen.

Altria said in its most recent annual filing that it expected actions related to the order to cost $31 million. American cigarette manufacturers spent more than $8 billion on advertising and promotional expenses in 2014, according to the Federal Trade Commission, though the vast majority of that was through price discounts. That year, they spent $50 million on magazine ads, while newspaper spending was too limited to report. The companies are not allowed to advertise on broadcast TV. In October, the F.D.A. expanded its public education campaign to emphasize the harmful effects of nicotine on the developing brain. The agency will follow that with ads aimed at discouraging young people from using e-cigarettes. About 15 percent of adults in the United States smoked cigarettes in 2015, compared with 43 percent in 1965, government figures show. And while the tobacco industry has moved to create safer products, Dr. Malone said the public should understand that the companies would rather not be running the corrective statements campaign. ""The only reason they're finally printing and broadcasting all of this is because they were forced to do so by a judge that found them guilty of racketeering,"" Dr. Malone said. ""Otherwise, this would still be going on.""","Court-ordered ads, which will start appearing on Sunday, are ""corrective statements"" about the health risks and addictive nature of smoking.",94fa68c4-d6de-5a2e-8de0-72fee5951198,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/25/business/25TOBACCOADS1/25TOBACCOADS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=b85623554675ca32d4a8c225d6a5df2b237f29328b6a9c27c6a9c55984e4df18&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A billboard ad for Marlboro cigarettes in Atlanta in 1995.

Movies,"'Firecrackers' Review: Young, Angry and Trapped",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/movies/firecrackers-review.html,"""Firecrackers,"" Jasmin Mozaffari's astonishingly confident (and perfectly named) debut feature, opens with a flare of fury and ends on a note of anxious optimism. What happens between is often sensed more than spoken: This is a movie that, like its characters, is more fluent in feelings than in words.

That initial fury belongs to Lou (a fierce Michaela Kurimsky), 17 years old and with a temperament to match her flaming hair. Fists flying, she lays into a foulmouthed acquaintance, but her anger seems surplus to the circumstances. What she's really raging against is a dying town too small to contain her, which is why she and her best friend, Chantal (Karena Evans), have saved their wages from cleaning motel rooms. Tomorrow, they will take off for New York City; tonight, they celebrate.

Shot by Catherine Lutes in a tumult of skin and hair and bleached-out surroundings, this scrappy Canadian drama (filmed in small-town Ontario) crackles and pops. There's an animalistic desperation to the performances and camerawork that nudges the theme of escape into one of survival itself. Stifling between lowering skies and the pale earth of parking lots where jerks and losers lurk, the young women seem constantly under threat.","In Jasmin Mozaffari's scrappy drama, two teenagers yearn to escape their backwater hometown before it smothers them.",039e4083-1636-57d4-9b67-032e417ce607,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/12/arts/11firecrackers/merlin_157715262_348c70cc-03bd-495e-94cf-bbc4644b6c27-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=7265872802f92f47bc38ccb918df20926c9fa01ce23df4a3b15a6629cee3ca52&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Michaela Kurimsky, left, and Karena Evans play best friends in ""Firecrackers.""",039e4083-1636-57d4-9b67-032e417ce607,N24News/imgs/039e4083-1636-57d4-9b67-032e417ce607.jpg,5
Movies,Review: 'West of the Jordan River' Examines the Mideast Peace Process,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/movies/west-of-the-jordan-river-review.html,"The Israeli director Amos Gitai models ""West of the Jordan River"" on his earlier ""Field Diary,"" a 1982 documentary that he filmed in the occupied territories. At the opening of the new film, Mr. Gitai somewhat pretentiously likens his role to that of an ""archaeologist"" of negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians.

This episodic documentary jumps back and forth in time, mainly between 1994, when Mr. Gitai filmed an interview with Yitzhak Rabin, then the Israeli prime minister, who was assassinated a year later, and 2016, when Mr. Gitai surveys the aftermath of the stalled peace process that Rabin fought for.

In the Rabin interview, the prime minister explains to the filmmaker how he reached the decision to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization, and argues for the necessity of social and economic development with Arab partners to secure a lasting peace. Other footage from 1994 -- some shot in Gaza and at a checkpoint on the Israeli-Gaza border -- is presented as a reminder that the past was not all that different from the present.

Through interviews with Israeli politicians, and Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank, ""West of the Jordan River"" gives voice to peace-seeking residents on both sides of the conflict. The journalist Ari Shavit, who wrote for the newspaper Haaretz before resigning after being accused of sexual harassment, says that if settlement construction continues, Israel will be forced to choose between abandoning its status as a Jewish state or abandoning its status as a democracy -- a recipe for national suicide.","In this documentary, the Israeli director Amos Gitai describes himself as an archaeologist of Israeli-Palestinian relations.",0c7c9a7f-cd46-5f84-9e80-fce066d06115,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/24/movies/west1/west1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=915332d0fea2d1f22b460647f6a666c14fdff317ae4b99fb1c0d0363581f6187&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The director Amos Gitai in the documentary ""West of the Jordan River.""",0c7c9a7f-cd46-5f84-9e80-fce066d06115,N24News/imgs/0c7c9a7f-cd46-5f84-9e80-fce066d06115.jpg,5
Sports,Sports Leagues Bar Fans and Cancel Games Amid Coronavirus Outbreak,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/sports/basketball/warriors-coronavirus-fans.html,"A steady trickle of cancellations and other disruptions in the sports world caused by the coronavirus outbreak erupted into an avalanche on Wednesday, with the N.B.A. abruptly suspending its season and the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and other events barring most spectators. A major tennis tournament was also in doubt. The N.B.A. acted after a player for the Utah Jazz, who had been listed as not playing, tested positive for the coronavirus, causing a moment of confusion before tip-off of a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The game was called off and the N.B.A. said the season would go on hiatus indefinitely. Earlier, the Golden State Warriors had become the first N.B.A. team to bar fans from games because of the coronavirus pandemic, announcing that it would close the doors to spectators for Thursday's game against the Nets at Chase Center in San Francisco. The move foreshadowed sweeping changes across sports as public officials pressured teams to bar fans to help limit the spread of the virus. At least 1,190 people in 41 states and Washington, D.C., have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a New York Times database, and at least 37 patients with the virus have died. A majority of the cases were in Washington State, California and New York.

In parts of Washington State and California, large gatherings were restricted entirely. In states like Ohio, the authorities said similar orders were on the way. And the governing body of men's tennis was in discussions about suspending tour events, including the Miami Open, a major tournament, for six weeks, according to three people briefed on the discussions who were not authorized to speak about them publicly. In Major League Baseball, the Seattle Mariners announced that they were working with the league to find alternative arrangements for home games at the end of March. The N.H.L.'s Columbus Blue Jackets said they would restrict attendance after the governor of Ohio announced that a ban on large gatherings was coming. Before the N.B.A.'s suspended season, the biggest move had come from the N.C.A.A., which barred all but a limited gathering of family members and essential staff members at the men's and women's basketball championship tournaments set to begin next week. The N.B.A.'s team owners held a conference call on Wednesday to decide what to do about their games, with the start of the playoffs just over a month away. The owners, according to a source familiar with the call, leaned toward playing in empty arenas for the rest of the season, but nothing was decided Wednesday night until news arrived that the Utah Jazz player had contracted the virus. On Wednesday, after San Francisco moved to ban gatherings of more than 1,000 people for at least two weeks, the Warriors announced that Thursday's home game against the Nets would be played without spectators, and that all other events at the arena would be canceled or postponed through March 21.

The San Francisco Giants, who play at Oracle Park, said in a statement that they would cancel their only event at the stadium during that city's two-week ban on public gatherings -- a March 24 exhibition against the Oakland Athletics. Santa Clara County, where the N.H.L.'s San Jose Sharks and M.L.S.'s San Jose Earthquakes play, announced a ban earlier in the week on gatherings of more than 1,000 people. The N.H.L. said in a statement, after the N.B.A. suspended its season, that it was evaluating its own plans for the season. Earlier, the league said it was working with the Sharks ""to determine an appropriate course of action for home games through the end of the month."" In Washington State, Gov. Jay Inslee banned gatherings of more than 250 in multiple counties, including King County, which encompasses T-Mobile Park, the home stadium of the Seattle Mariners, and CenturyLink Field, where the Seattle Sounders FC of the M.L.S. play. The Sounders said their March 21 match against FC Dallas, which was to take place at CenturyLink Field, would be postponed. While many events in different industries have been canceled or changed because of the health crisis, attention sharply shifted to the sports world on Wednesday after Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, put the sports leagues on notice in an appearance before lawmakers. ""We would recommend that there not be large crowds,"" Dr. Fauci said. ""If that means not having any people in the audience when the N.B.A. plays, so be it. But as a public health official, anything that has large crowds is something that would give a risk to spread."" Still, the N.B.A. had seemed determined all day to carry on in some capacity. In Washington, D.C., despite a recommendation from the Department of Health that large gatherings be postponed or canceled, Monumental Sports and Entertainment, the ownership group of the Washington Wizards and the N.H.L.'s Washington Capitals, said its home games would be played as scheduled ""at the current direction"" of both leagues.","The N.B.A. abruptly suspended its season after a player tested positive for the coronavirus.

Technology,How to Juice and Jam at the Same Time,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/technology/personaltech/charge-battery-listening-music.html,"Q. Is there any way to both charge the phone and listen to music at the same time on these new models that don't have the traditional headphone jack?

A. Apple retired the 3.5-millimeter jack in 2016 with the iPhone 7, and Google omitted the port on its Pixel 2 phones last year -- leaving owners of those models a single Lightning or USB-C connection to use for earbuds and the battery charger. Other phones will likely follow suit if they haven't already, and a few popular workarounds have emerged for people who like to listen to audio while the phone's battery is charging.

For those who prefer the fidelity of wired headphones (and the fact you don't have to charge those up as well), a port adapter may be your best option, and you can find different products online. Although it has mixed reviews, Belkin's Lightning Audio + Charge RockStar adapter is one option for the iPhone, and can be found for $40 or less. For Google Pixel 2 owners in a similar situation, Moshi's USB-C Digital Adapter With Charging dongle is about $45.

If you do not want to keep track of a port adapter, using a wireless charging mat is another approach. These mats, like those that use the Qi technology, allow you to place the phone on its surface to power up the battery. This leaves the single connection port free for headphones.","If your phone uses a single port for the charger and headphones, you can still power the battery while you listen to music — with the help of some additional gear.",916d98b6-ebfb-50c4-87f0-d5a233d4ca4e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/26/technology/personaltech/26techtipwebART/26techtipwebART-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=ac92c34b23000c7a8d76d5822eb3ae85d484f13f083261f66047baab383c2970&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Wireless Bluetooth headphones allow you to listen to music while a battery charger is plugged into the phone's one port.,916d98b6-ebfb-50c4-87f0-d5a233d4ca4e,N24News/imgs/916d98b6-ebfb-50c4-87f0-d5a233d4ca4e.jpg,20
Global Business,Support Is Offered to Greek Banks After Latest Downgrade,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/business/global/support-is-offered-to-greek-banks-after-latest-downgrade.html,"FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank acted on Tuesday to prevent a potential collapse of the Greek banking system after the country was declared by a large ratings agency to be in ""selective default,"" making Greek bonds ineligible as collateral for loans from the central bank.

Standard & Poor's issued the most recent downgrade late Monday because of the debt-reduction deal reached last week with Greece's private sector creditors.

Greece will pay back less than half the face value of its bonds under the agreement, which is ostensibly voluntary.

The central bank did not specifically mention the S.& P. downgrade on Tuesday, but it said in a news release that the agreement with creditors meant that Greek bonds could no longer be used as collateral to obtain cash from the central bank.","Although Greek bonds can no longer be used as collateral with the European Central Bank, national central banks can step in under a stop-gap measure.",1d2319f4-e664-52d1-a499-fe5c5dda9da5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/02/29/business/ECB/ECB-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=370&w=600&s=7a80156045fd5b205e68138ae985514966d0b569a668a1d71a8ebf3888832db0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Greek policemen, firefighters and coast guards protested planned wage and pension cuts on Tuesday in Athens.",1d2319f4-e664-52d1-a499-fe5c5dda9da5,N24News/imgs/1d2319f4-e664-52d1-a499-fe5c5dda9da5.jpg,24
Travel,"Tamales, Catfish and Meringue Pie: Delicacies of the Mississippi Delta",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/travel/tamales-catfish-pie-delicacies-of-the-mississippi-delta.html,"As I stared into my Styrofoam container of fried chicken gizzards, I considered my mission. I had set out to explore the culinary delights of the Mississippi Delta, hoping to discover foods with rich histories unfamiliar to those who had never visited. These gizzards were a start, but I had my eye out for tamales, neck bones, pies topped with ankle-deep meringue. I wanted to explore the established restaurants and the odd hole-in-the-wall joints. But I hadn't quite made it to Mississippi yet; I'd stopped 20 miles short, across the Mississippi River in Marvell, Ark. Eating at the Double Quick gas station -- a small chain based in Indianola, Miss., scattered throughout the Delta, and known for its soul food offerings of fried chicken and fish and stomach-engorging sides -- didn't feel like cheating, though, as the gastronomic borders in the deltas of Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi tend to blur. In these epicurean time capsules, created by insurmountable and harrowing poverty, locals prepare and enjoy dishes that stretch ingredients sourced from the land's nutrient-rich earth and blended from a stew of cultural influences. My reverie was interrupted by an elderly woman at the booth across from me, asking if I was one of the Teach for America teachers in town. I looked up and explained that I lived in New Orleans. ""New Orleans,"" she said with all the energy the offensively steamy Delta day would provide. ""Never been that far from here, but I got to get some of that great food and gumbo before I die.""

I popped a few final gizzards into my mouth, chewed through their strange gumminess and heat-tinged saltiness, and got up to leave. As I drove across the river, I reflected further on a region that had been unchanged by time. Time -- and the economic pressures of the era we live in. A shrinking job market has led to a shrinking population and rampant poverty. A renewed effort by the Mississippi Tourism Association has helped create a greater flow of tourists to the region by creating the Mississippi Blues Trail and the Mississippi Freedom Trail. But there are a growing number of individuals visiting the Delta specifically for its food. ""For some reason the food in the Delta is just different,"" said Sylvester Hoover, a blues and civil rights guide and owner of Hoover's Grocery, which I visited in Greenwood, Miss. ""It's got a different taste to it. Turnip greens here don't taste like turnip greens outside of here. None of your foods taste the same as it does here in the Mississippi Delta because in the Delta a lot of it was raised here. It's got a different, good dusty taste to it.""

Once I made it into Mississippi, I aimed to find more of that food and figure out what about it made people drive to the poorest area in the country. And I started in Clarksdale. Right at the famous crossroads where the late blues musician Robert Johnson supposedly sold his soul, where Highway 61 and 49 intersect, I came across Abe's Bar-B-Q, famous for its barbecue and hot tamales. Opened by Lebanese immigrants in 1924 (it moved to its current location in the mid-1930s), Abe's is an institution. Paper plates are slathered with barbecue ribs, pulled pork, burgers and a constant flood of chili; the frozen grape leaves available for order are the only giveaway of its ethnic background.

Phyllis Fowler, sister of the current owner, Pat Davis, worked at the restaurant -- then owned by the eponymous Abe -- in high school and recently returned after retiring from a different career. It's very much a family-run operation that includes cousins and her nephew. After I took my time consulting the menu, she recommended a burger with coleslaw and barbecue sauce. ""It's what I grew up on,"" she said. ""Wrap it in foil for 30 minutes and it's just perfect."" I added an order of tamales topped with the house chili and cheese and went to town, ignoring her prescribed 30-minute wait, but the potency of the food made each bite more difficult than the last. The tamales were covered in so much chili I couldn't tell how many there were. How the tamale made its way to Mississippi is still debated. Some say it arrived with the migrant laborers who came in to help with the cotton harvest. Others claim Mississippi soldiers from the Mexican-American War returned with tamale recipes, and a few assert tamales are a result of a Native American population with a surplus of maize. Robert Johnson references the cornmeal and pork packaged treat in his 1936 song ""They're Red Hot,"" in which he tells the story of a girl who is selling tamales ""two for a nickel, got four for a dime.""

Whatever the true history, tamale production throughout the Mississippi Delta remains high. Whose is best is hotly contested, but in the spirit of the other trails the Southern Foodways Alliance, headquartered in Oxford, Miss., cobbled together a trail of its own for the gastronomically curious -- the Hot Tamale Trail. Traveling its route proves that no two tamales are the same. (Doe's Eat Place in Greenville, Reno's Cafe in Greenwood and the White Front Cafe in Rosedale are a few other classic tamale joints worth checking out.) ""Mile High"" coconut meringue pie, a signature item at the Crystal Grill in Greenwood, Miss. Robert Rausch for The New York Times Forty minutes south of Clarksdale sits Cleveland, and the Senator's Place, a soul food restaurant that offers plate lunches and a simple cafeteria-like decor. Opened in 2003 by Willie Simmons, a Democratic state senator who has represented his district since 1993, the restaurant pays homage to Senator Simmons' mother who fed 11 children on the recipes Senator Simmons' kitchen staff now use. While there I gorged myself on a plate of smothered chicken, candied yams, collard greens with ham and neck bones. ""We eat practically every [neck bone] they send down South as well as the ones that are here because neck bones is kind of a special meal,"" Senator Simmons told me, ""especially when you can find the ones that we have that are meaty. When you season it properly, some folks say it becomes a delicacy."" Neck bones come from the pig and were long considered a throwaway piece of the animal. The intrepid people of the Delta didn't let that food go to waste and have always boldly cooked a cut many dismissed as inedible. It is considered a staple of soul food cooking and has recently gained popularity -- an analogous reclamation to the more mainstream fandom surrounding pork belly. ""It used to be a cheap item, but the more demand you have for it, like anything else, the more the price tends to go up,"" Senator Simmons said. ""We're seeing the cost of neck bones increase over the years, but it continues to be one of the items people love to eat.""

The restaurant ""has grown on me for 60 years,"" said Johnny Ballas, who still cooks in the kitchen and pulls 70-hour workweeks, and who told me that the secret of the meringue is in the simple syrup. ""The best thing about it is seeing families in the tradition of children bringing their children, and I've seen all that from fathers bringing their kids and them bringing their kids now."" But there's an interesting dichotomy growing in Greenwood and outside of it. A ""New South"" has emerged. Though its ideas are somewhat vague, it tries to promote the belief the South has become more diverse, progressive and healthy. It's a dismissal of the grease. The Delta Bistropub, co-owned by Fred Carl Jr. -- the founder and former chief executive of Viking Range Corporation, a company that has helped keep this small Delta town alive -- and the James Beard-nominated chef Taylor Bowen Ricketts, offers small plates and upscale cocktails, but the food remains powerfully Southern to appease the expectations of tourists and locals alike. Ms. Ricketts came to Greenwood from Oxford to start the Delta Fresh Market, a cafe and farmers' market, and slowly developed an appreciation for her new town. The farm-to-table movement started in the Delta long before it became a national trend, she said. It's this sort of authenticity that excites Ms. Ricketts, and though this isn't where she is from, it is what has made it home. ""I cried for three days when I moved here,"" she said, leaning forward on her stool and resting her elbows on her bar. ""But now, I don't know why -- I hate to love it so much. There's something about the dirt. It gets stuck in your toes."" Pickled onion hush puppies with pimento cheese queso and andouille sausage at the Delta Bistropub.

Television,What Was the Problem With 'Wyatt Cenac's Problem Areas'?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/arts/television/wyatt-cenac-problem-areas.html,"""It is very bizarre to think that when we did it, people just weren't ready to hear about it or think about it,"" Wyatt Cenac said.Credit...Photographs by Brad Ogbonna for The New York Times



""It is very bizarre to think that when we did it, people just weren't ready to hear about it or think about it,"" Wyatt Cenac said.

In the debut season of his topical HBO comedy series, Wyatt Cenac resolved to tackle the challenging issue of police reform in America. The show, ""Wyatt Cenac's Problem Areas,"" drew on its host's experience as a former correspondent for ""The Daily Show,"" allowing him to meet with activists, law enforcement officials and elected leaders across the country. Using a mixture of journalism and comedy, Cenac sought to educate viewers on subjects like community policing, consent decrees, defunding and abolition. If it were airing on HBO now, when the killings of Black Americans have led to nationwide protests and the strongest demands for police reform in a generation, ""Problem Areas"" would be an especially timely series. But that prescient season was broadcast two years ago, and the program was canceled in 2019. Looking back on ""Problem Areas"" now, Cenac remains immensely proud of the show. ""It felt like our opportunity to talk about this thing that no one else in late-night was dealing with, that's not making its way into the dialogue,"" he said in a recent interview. But having seen police reform become a central issue of American life as the country confronts institutionalized racism and audiences hasten to inform themselves on the subject, Cenac is trying to understand why his efforts to highlight it did not gain much traction at the time.

Though he had considered devoting the season to a sprawling idea like gun control, Cenac said the killings of Michael Brown in 2014 and Philando Castile in 2016 compelled him to cover policing. The overall issue was vast, but Cenac hoped to bring it into focus through specific issues of reform in each city he visited. ""You could tell a full story about policing, but also be able to see chapters of it by going to different places,"" he said. ""If you want to fix Minneapolis, you've got to be in Minneapolis."" These preliminary decisions led to some obstacles, though not necessarily insurmountable ones. The journalistic nature of the show made it difficult to know what story ""Problem Areas"" would tell until Cenac completed his field reporting. ""You couldn't game out what your thesis or solution was going to be until you went through that process,"" said Ezra Edelman, the documentary filmmaker (""O.J.: Made in America"") who was an executive producer of ""Problem Areas."" ""What's your beginning, middle and end?"" Edelman said. ""It's hard to know that when you're doing something that is explorative and investigative by nature.""

Timothy Greenberg, a fellow ""Daily Show"" alum who also worked as an executive producer on ""Problem Areas,"" said the need for people who would speak on camera also proved limiting. ""You have to book police who are willing to go on television and talk about the difficulties in policing,"" Greenberg said. ""That's hard to do. It's borderline impossible."" Perhaps the most significant question facing ""Problem Areas"" was one of tone and how it would create comedy from this raw material. ""With something as serious as policing, how do you find the humor in it?"" Edelman said. ""Where do you inject levity with characters that are talking about dead-serious topics?"" Though ""Problem Areas"" opened each episode with shorter, in-studio segments where Cenac could be loose and lighthearted, his field pieces presented him as a more open-minded interviewer who was not necessarily striving for punch lines. As Greenberg put it, ""Wyatt's instincts are to dig into the complexity and the nuance and spend time there, not always to offer simple, easily digested answers that make a crowd cheer.""

Instead, around 300,000 viewers watched the first episode and the show rarely improved on those numbers. ""I remember being frustrated that it did not get more pickup and more attention at the time,"" said John Oliver, the host of HBO's ""Last Week Tonight"" and an executive producer of ""Problem Areas."" ""I thought, well, OK, maybe people will find it,"" Oliver said. ""That's the beauty of HBO, right? You can come back and find it."" But audiences did not seek out the series in sizable numbers, either. HBO renewed ""Problem Areas"" for a second season in which it focused on education reform, after which the show was canceled. Nina Rosenstein, an executive vice president of HBO programming, said that ""Problem Areas"" was the show that the network had hoped for, but the program did not build on its lead-in show, ""Real Time With Bill Maher,"" on Friday nights.

""Content-wise, we were so happy with it,"" she said. ""It was scheduled in a perfect place. We supported it on air and with marketing. It was teed up for success."" Cenac said he hoped HBO would bolster its support for a show in need of viewership, but instead felt that the network backed away from his struggling series. When ""Problem Areas"" was canceled, he said, he was told by HBO executives that it might have been renewed if it had been nominated for more awards. ""In retrospect,"" he said, ""it was something I found odd as HBO is the one in charge of pushing their shows for award recognition."" Rosenstein said ""there's so many different ways to measure success"" for HBO programs: ""being in the zeitgeist, being reviewed by critics, being talked about on social media."" In this case, she said, ""it just didn't catch fire the way we hoped."" She said HBO remained ""really proud of the show,"" adding that the network was preparing a stand-up comedy special with Cenac. ""He's in the family and I can't wait to see what he comes up with,"" she said. Cenac said the stand-up special was part of his contract with HBO but that ""it's more of an obligation to fulfill versus something I actually want to do.""

""I'd kind of lost the itch for stand-up,"" he continued, ""but could use the check."" Cenac said that going into ""Problem Areas,"" he was aware that late-night shows hosted by Black men tended to have brief life spans, pointing to past programs like ""D.L. Hughley Breaks the News,"" ""The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore"" and ""Totally Biased With W. Kamau Bell,"" none of which lasted more than two seasons. (There are also prominent exceptions, like Trevor Noah's tenure on ""The Daily Show,"" which he took over in 2015.) ""Whatever that thing is, that thing is real,"" Cenac said. ""There was a pattern that existed. You've got two and done, and I am part of that club."" He anticipated this with a sardonic joke in the first episode of ""Problem Areas,"" when he followed an interview with Hassan Beck, a community activist who is Black, with a video clip of Peter Moskos, a professor and former police officer who is white, making an almost identical point. What he was trying to illustrate, Cenac said, is that ""when a Black guy says something profound, for it to really land, you need a white guy to basically say the same thing."" Oliver agreed that there was ""certainly something there"" to Cenac's point about the late-night environment. Pointing to the praise that ""Last Week Tonight With John Oliver"" has received for its own recent coverage of police reform, Oliver said, ""The fact that that got a bunch of attention, coming from a white man, I do think is a pretty sad way to almost embody the problems that exist, rather than showing any way to solve them.""

Cenac said he had grown used to seeing the topics he covered on ""Problem Areas"" resurface in the news and on other TV shows, though he did not single out any of the current late-night programs. ""You throw your hands up,"" he said. ""Well, I guess this is the way of the world."" Current events have brought renewed attention to the first season of ""Problem Areas,"" and HBO has made the series available on services like YouTube, HBO Max and HBO.com. While Cenac contemplates his next move, his friends say that he has been reluctant to capitalize on this wave of attention. Recalling a recent conversation with Cenac, Greenberg said: ""I was like, you should be out pitching the next iteration of the show. He said to me he hadn't given much thought to it.""

""That just goes to show, Wyatt is a real artist first,"" Greenberg said. ""As a strategic thinker in terms of Hollywood, that's a distant second."" Cenac said he had not been dissuaded from covering material that he is passionate about, even if it's perceived as sensitive or potentially polarizing. What eluded him on ""Problem Areas,"" he said, was a way to convey these ideas to a mass audience. He'll keep striving for the right format, but he couldn't help but feel that the show not connecting was ultimately his fault. ""Some people are Coke and some people are RC Cola, and I may just be RC Cola,"" Cenac said. ""How do I get more people to recognize that I'm slightly cheaper and just as bad for you as that other soda?""","Two years ago, his HBO series tried to take on police reform in a thoughtful, comedic way. But being ahead of its time didn't help keep it on the air.",9c38b0b3-62d9-520f-a0ca-dc6b853cb8b7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/09/arts/08wyatt-cenac5/08wyatt-cenac5-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=f67ee50f2df9559de5c17577754f8b64b974cb61e17803348357710cf63ec5e8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Noting that few late-night shows with Black men as hosts last for a third season, Cenac said, ""You've got two and done, and I am part of that club.""",9c38b0b3-62d9-520f-a0ca-dc6b853cb8b7,N24News/imgs/9c38b0b3-62d9-520f-a0ca-dc6b853cb8b7.jpg,3
Music,Jazz Fest at 50: The Stubbornness and Joy of New Orleans,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/arts/music/new-orleans-jazz-festival-50th-anniversary.html,"The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage festival has proved ambitious and resilient, surviving deficits, rainouts and the aftermath of hurricanes over its half-century history.

It started small, half a century ago, but with a mission. The first New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival was held in 1970 in Beauregard Square, previously and afterward known as Congo Square, where African drumming and dancing had persisted through the era of slavery. It was modeled on the traditional-music showcases at the Newport Folk Festival, but filled entirely with Louisiana's own styles -- jazz, blues, gospel, brass bands, zydeco, Mardi Gras Indians and much more. Duke Ellington, the only performer without Louisiana roots, was commissioned to write and perform a ""New Orleans Suite."" Nearly two dozen food vendors offered jambalaya, etouffee and other specialties. Tickets were $3. But only about 300 people showed up, and the overstocked vendors ended up feeding children from a nearby orphanage.

""Jazz Fest is everything that you love about New Orleans to begin with,"" said Ivan Neville, the keyboardist who made his first appearance there in 1977; he is performing this year with his band Dumpstaphunk and in the Foundation of Funk with the rhythm section of the Meters, the band co-founded in 1965 by his uncle, Art Neville. ""It's the most variety of music that you'll ever see in one given place, so that's first, and then the best food that you will ever eat in your entire life."" [Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.] In recent years, Jazz Fest has drawn between 400,000 and 500,000 attendees across its two extended weekends; its peak, in 2001, was 618,000. Festival organizers estimate that it brings $300 million into the New Orleans economy. This year's event includes nationally known headliners and hitmakers, among them Katy Perry, J Balvin, Chris Stapleton, Diana Ross and Pitbull, as well as habitual Jazz Fest performers including Santana, Bonnie Raitt, Jimmy Buffett, Al Green, Herbie Hancock and the Dave Matthews Band. Yet while visiting attractions have boosted attendance, they have never defined the festival. Quint Davis, who has booked music for Jazz Fest since it began and is now the C.E.O. of Festival Productions-New Orleans, noted that this year's lineup includes 688 groups, ""and 600 of them are from New Orleans and South Louisiana.""

Jazz Fest has maintained its mandate because it operates far differently from other American festivals its size. Its music encompasses vintage jazz to chart-topping reggaeton; its audience is genuinely all-ages. It takes place in daylight, ending at 7 p.m. -- which not only encourages visitors to seek out night life, but also rules out stage spectacles dependent on lights and video, emphasizing old-school musicianship instead. More significantly, Jazz Fest is nonprofit, channeling revenues back into Louisiana music. ""The mission of the festival all along has been to make a full circle,"" Davis said. ""To go back and support the culture that you're promoting.""

Jazz Fest generates about $3 million each year for the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, according to the foundation's executive director, Don Marshall. The foundation owns the license of the New Orleans public radio station WWOZ-FM -- which plays the kind of music heard at the festival year-round -- and provides the bulk of its funding. The foundation also gives 8,500 Jazz Fest tickets to community groups; runs the free Heritage School of Music and supports other music-education programs; presents four free annual music festivals in New Orleans; subsidizes performances by Louisiana musicians across the state; underwrites a musicians' clinic; documents the region's musical history, and steps in with other efforts at maintaining New Orleans traditions. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the foundation arranged to buy beads and feathers for the Mardi Gras Indian tribes who, in a New Orleans tradition, sew new, eye-popping costumes each year and dance in the streets -- and did so even after losing everything in the storm. And when the city raised the price of police permits for street parades, affecting jazz funerals and other community events, the foundation helped pay for them.

The festival's own legacy began with the producer George Wein. He had presented the Newport Folk Festival and the Newport Jazz Festival, and in the early 1960s he was approached by New Orleans city officials and its hotel association. He told them he could not produce a jazz festival in a city that enforced segregation. Eventually, years after the passage of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, he seized the chance to create a New Orleans festival ""combining the two festivals I had done in Newport, the folk and the jazz,"" he said in an interview. He didn't want to simply import well-known musicians for jazz concerts in auditoriums; for him, the ""heritage"" aspect of the festival, bringing all of New Orleans's musical subcultures to the stage, was paramount from the start. ""We had in mind to create a permanent relationship with the culture of New Orleans,"" he said. Davis, a New Orleans native, had coinciding ambitions. ""My first idea was to have the world's biggest backyard barbecue, like the old rent parties,"" he said. That first festival in 1970 lost $40,000, then a sizable downside. But it survived a few shaky years and soon outgrew Beauregard Square, moving to its current site, the Fair Grounds racetrack, where it could add more stages and more food vendors, all still homegrown. This year's festival has 14 stages, large and small, and five dozen food vendors.

The festival became self-supporting by the mid-1970s, and Wein's Festival Productions considered turning it into a for-profit corporation. But the New Orleans-based staff resisted that idea, and Wein conceded. In his memoir, ""Myself Among Others,"" he wrote, ""It was probably the biggest financial mistake I ever made."" Decades later, the many repeat visitors to Jazz Fest -- often wearing past years' souvenir New Orleans-themed Hawaiian shirts -- bask in its routines. They welcome the annual reappearance of favorite performers, including New Orleans R&B stalwarts like Irma Thomas and Clarence (Frogman) Henry, long-running groups like the Rebirth Brass Band and members of Louisiana music dynasties like the Neville, Chenier and Marsalis families. In 1970, the pianist Ellis Marsalis advised the first festival on booking the city's up-and-coming jazz bandleaders. ""George didn't know the musicians yet, and I knew all of the musicians that could play,"" Marsalis recalled. ""I said, yeah, no problem."" Now 84, Marsalis will be performing his compositions at Jazz Fest on April 28 with his four sons: Wynton, Branford, Delfeayo and Jason.

After years of growth, the first decade of the 2000s brought challenges for Jazz Fest. The 2003 festival was a financial and physical washout, rained out for five days and running a large loss. The foundation's executive committee courted new producers, until Davis and Festival Productions-New Orleans arranged a partnership with A.E.G. Entertainment, the second largest promoter of music events worldwide (after Live Nation). ""Up till then,"" Davis recalled, ""We're down here doing this, we've got no connections professionally to the outside world, we've got no clout, we're not connected to the music industry. When we partnered with A.E.G., now, if we needed a big gun, we had the second biggest company in music behind us.""

A continuing question for Jazz Fest, Ramsey said, is, ""How does the festival change and adjust to keep its focus on the heritage music, and also still satisfy an audience and draw the numbers that it needs to survive financially?"" But in 2019, Jazz Fest will proudly serve up its familiar pleasures. Over five decades, it has become a tradition of its own. ""The real bulwark of our success,"" Davis said, ""is not knowing any better.""","Over a half-century, the eclectic and beloved live-music and food event has grown inseparable from the cultural ecosystem of its hometown.",d14d0f04-e0d3-5b30-8c0b-0b0741f58626,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/24/arts/24jazzfest-walkup10/24jazzfest-walkup10-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=c42e0a7d4efbf85a9e3693b2cc683c27d05d6ae795123b041e9d6aa671fecd8b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage festival has proved ambitious and resilient, surviving deficits, rainouts and the aftermath of hurricanes over its half-century history.",d14d0f04-e0d3-5b30-8c0b-0b0741f58626,N24News/imgs/d14d0f04-e0d3-5b30-8c0b-0b0741f58626.jpg,12
Opinion,States Are in Crisis. Why Won't Trump Help?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/opinion/states-coronavirus-federalism.html,"When most people think of the New Deal, they think of the enduring institutions it created -- above all, the web of agencies and programs that has provided the social safety net, such as it is, for life in the United States since the 1950s. A national retirement system, public housing, collective bargaining, unemployment insurance, the minimum wage -- all had their origins during the Great Depression. More important than any specific benefits, however, was the way that the New Deal recast the structure of American federalism. Washington stepped in to address a crisis that states and local governments were failing miserably to meet on their own, overwhelmed by tremendous need and limited by the resources and powers at their disposal. New Deal federalism has shaped American governance for almost a century, and it has played a vital role in our country's success. Now, with the Covid-19 crisis wreaking havoc across every state in America and the president unwilling to hold up Washington's end of the bargain, that system may be falling apart. For all the New Deal's achievements, the American welfare state would never live up to the fuller protections provided by some European nations and our neighbor Canada. And there were glaring flaws in the programs that were created, such as excluding agricultural and domestic workers from the minimum wage guarantees of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and refusing to pass anti-lynching legislation. Both of these failures were partly attributable to the fragile coalition of Southern Democrats and Northern liberals that made the New Deal possible.

Still, the New Deal's programs, enhanced by the Great Society's addition of Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960s and President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act in 2010, made the United States on the eve of the Covid-19 pandemic a far more benevolent place than it had been when the Great Depression hit in 1929. New Deal federalism likewise made it easier for the states to respond to challenges and emergencies. But in exchange for federal resources, states accepted the federal government's expectations and regulations. That relationship has substantially contributed to historic levels of economic prosperity and notable progress toward greater class and racial equality across regions. Many of the landmark programs originating in the New Deal and the postwar era were built on this system of governance, with great success. Social Security has reduced poverty among older Americans. Intervention by the U.S. Justice Department helped the struggle to register African-American voters in the South and to integrate public accommodations nationwide. And the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 provided a legal basis for accountability, even if challenging to enforce. The expansion of federal authority took place under Republican and Democratic presidents alike. When the variation in workplace protections state by state left some workers more endangered than others, the federal government under President Richard Nixon created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to set national standards for safety. And faced with wildly unequal welfare benefits across the states, the government instituted the uniform, federally funded Supplemental Security Income program in the early 1970s. Federal consumer protection and clean air and water legislation in the 1960s and 1970s protected citizens in all states, however friendly their local leaders were to mass marketers or polluters.

Surely federal standards were enforced more rigorously in some places than in others. And from Richard Nixon's New Federalism to Ronald Reagan's assertion that ""government is the problem"" to Bill Clinton's pledge to ""end welfare as we know it,"" a backlash against big government gained ground steadily. For the past 50 years, privatization and deregulation have been the buzzwords of presidential administrations of both parties, and inequalities of wealth have grown. But the essential core of the New Deal welfare state has survived. The federal government's enormous purse and power continue to deliver benefits and protections, even as it has also undertaken more pernicious national policies, such as the expansion of incarceration. Until now. The Trump administration's unwillingness or inability to manage the pandemic has called into question the balance of power between the federal government and the states that has prevailed for almost a century. Likewise, a growing chorus of Republican leaders is seizing the moment to try to turn back the clock to the pre-New Deal days, intent on severing the federal obligations to states in crisis. When Covid-19 reared its ugly head this winter, governors and mayors quite naturally expected the federal government to supply medical equipment, to set strict standards guiding testing and public activity and to mount a national strategy for battling the disease. Instead what they encountered was an anemic federal response that belittled anything more as resembling the menial labor of a shipping clerk. The Trump White House defined the federal role as the president pontificating at daily briefings and playing a doctor on TV. His ""L'etat, c'est moi"" approach, governors were shocked to discover, left them scrambling to manage the crisis on their own, even finding themselves pitted against one another -- and the federal government -- in securing crucial supplies. States with areas where the epidemic proved most virulent had no choice but to mount their own foreign-trade policies, securing supplies when possible from abroad. There is much to lament about Mr. Trump's failure to assume responsibility at this catastrophic time. But the greatest damage, apart from the unnecessary loss of lives, may be the undermining of uniform national standards of benefits and protections that had emerged from a national crisis in the 1930s -- and that provided the bedrock for so much subsequent stability and prosperity. The abandonment of a federalist system where states are accountable to Washington and residents everywhere can expect equitable treatment is recasting the United States of America to favor States over United. That retrenchment may prove to be one of the direst consequences of Covid-19.

Music,"Vittorio Grigolo, Star Tenor, Fired for 'Inappropriate' Behavior",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/arts/music/vittorio-grigolo.html,"Vittorio Grigolo, one of opera's star tenors, was dismissed by the Metropolitan Opera on Thursday after he was fired by the Royal Opera in London, which found that he had engaged in ""inappropriate and aggressive behavior"" during a recent company tour of Japan. The Royal Opera said that an independent investigation of the incident, which occurred in September in Tokyo, concluded that Mr. Grigolo's ""inappropriate and aggressive behavior at the curtain call and afterward fell below the standards we expect of our staff and performers."" The Royal removed him from his upcoming performances with the company, and the Met, which had suspended him after the incident, quickly followed suit. Mr. Grigolo pre-empted the announcement of his dismissal with a post on Instagram. ""I recognize that my personality can be very exuberant at times, and I am willing to make sure that what happened will not happen again in the future,"" he wrote. With his dismissal from the Royal Opera and the Met, where he had been scheduled to sing Alfredo in Verdi's ""La Traviata"" this winter, Mr. Grigolo became the latest in a line of opera luminaries whose careers have been upended by allegations of misconduct and abusive behavior.

Placido Domingo, one of opera's most prominent figures, lost all of his remaining United States engagements this year and stepped down as general director of Los Angeles Opera amid allegations that he had sexually harassed women. And the Met fired James Levine, its longtime music director, in 2018 after finding evidence that he had ""engaged in sexually abusive and harassing conduct toward vulnerable artists."" (Both men have denied the allegations.) Mr. Grigolo's dismissal stemmed from an incident on Sept. 18, when he was singing Gounod's ""Faust"" while on tour with the Royal Opera in Japan. The details of what happened are not clear. The Sun, a British tabloid, reported that Mr. Grigolo was accused of ""allegedly grabbing a female member of the chorus"" onstage during a curtain call, in view of the audience, and then arguing ""vehemently"" when asked to stop. Several Italian publications suggested it had been a misunderstanding, saying that Mr. Grigolo had touched the padded belly of a dancer playing a pregnant woman, and cursed at her when she objected. The Royal Opera took the allegations seriously enough that Mr. Grigolo was replaced for the next performance by another tenor, Georgy Vasiliev.

Mr. Grigolo's publicist did not respond to a request for comment shortly after the incident. But in an Instagram post this fall, Mr. Grigolo thanked his fans and friends for their support and said that he would cooperate with the investigation. ""I remain calm,"" he wrote. He also posted an image from a curtain call he had taken during the Japan tour.

The Royal Opera did not reveal details about the incident on Thursday, or what its investigation found. Mr. Grigolo claimed in his Instagram post that the investigation had contradicted ""accusations made against me by several journalists and tabloids"" and said ""even though it was never my intention to offend anyone, the situation deteriorated unexpectedly due to a brawl between colleagues."" It was not immediately clear if Mr. Grigolo might be invited back by either company in the future. In recent years, Mr. Grigolo has been establishing himself as something modern opera houses desperately need in the post-""Three Tenors"" era: an exciting leading man. His strong voice and passionate, sometimes over the top stage presence made him a favorite with fans. Mr. Grigolo also cultivated a rebellious image -- ""The Bad Boy of Opera"" was the name of a short film Bruce Weber made about him for Italian Vanity Fair, and he was known to race motorcycles and drive sports cars offstage. ""I like to push things to the limit,"" he told The New York Times in April. Though some critics accused him of showboating and unfocused singing, especially early in his career, he had been winning more than his share of rave reviews in recent years. Zachary Woolfe described one of his Met performances in The Times in 2017 as ""both brazen and intimate"" and added that ""he may be the most galvanically convincing singer in the world today."" The Royal Opera, whose findings now threaten to derail his career, was also where his international reputation was launched in 2010, when he stepped into a performance of Massenet's ""Manon"" and won plaudits. ""A great operatic career lies in his sights,"" Rupert Christiansen wrote in a five-star review of that performance in The Telegraph, ""if he keeps his wits about him.""",The Metropolitan Opera and the Royal Opera in London dismissed the singer for an incident during the Royal's tour of Japan in September.,4da528e2-95e8-5345-8b87-6a5190a03fa8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/04/arts/04tenor-item/04tenor-item-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=e543495ee81be3141386a9a9bf3c64162ae1f0917894fea55854fa4b6be19128&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Vittorio Grigolo, one of opera's star tenors, was dismissed by the Metropolitan Opera on Thursday after being fired by the Royal Opera in London.",4da528e2-95e8-5345-8b87-6a5190a03fa8,N24News/imgs/4da528e2-95e8-5345-8b87-6a5190a03fa8.jpg,12
Theater,Mamas Going Strong: A Conversation With Linda and Laura Benanti,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/theater/mamas-going-strong-a-conversation-with-linda-and-laura-benanti.html,"Fans of Laura Benanti, the Tony Award-winning actress of Broadway (""Gypsy"") and television (""Supergirl,"" ""The Sound of Music Live!""), know that she has an entertainingly complicated relationship with her mother, Linda. Linda Benanti, a voice teacher and former Broadway actress, is often name-checked in her daughter's cabaret show and on her Twitter feed, portrayed -- in Laura's telling, anyway -- as a voice of well-intentioned parental nagging, encouragement and reason. It's a bond that has grown even stronger since Laura gave birth to a daughter of her own, Ella Rose Benanti-Brown, on Feb. 14. Linda and Laura Benanti will bring their delightfully sparring relationship, as well as some of their favorite songs, to audiences in a cabaret show, ""The Story Goes On,"" that they will perform at Feinstein's/54 Below on Friday and Saturday. Recently, at Laura Benanti's home in West Harlem, Laura was settling into her new life as a mother, with Ella snoozing in her lap, while Linda looked on in appreciation. Together they tried to predict how Linda's mothering skills had been passed down (""I'm going to be that weird parent at the sleepover, trying to make sure everybody's nice to her,"" Laura announced), while also campaigning not so subtly for the performer's next Broadway role. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. How has your relationship changed since Ella's birth?

LAURA BENANTI She was here for the first 10 days of Ella's life. 

LINDA BENANTI Pitched a tent, moved in, took care of [Laura and Patrick Brown, her husband] so they could take care of the baby. And then they came out to our house. 

LAURA Because I lost my mind. The first 10 days, it was like, everything's perfect! The baby's amazing! And then the day she left, everything went to hell. The baby was inconsolable.

Did you always know Laura would grow up to be an actress?

LINDA Oh, Laura knew. [Laughs] It wasn't me saying: ""You know what, honey? I think you might like this."" This was Laura getting up on her wooden Fisher-Price slide, going, ""Presenting -- !""

LAURA Shy. Always shy. My first words were, ""Can I have an agent?""

LINDA I filmed her saying that. 

Laura, when did you realize that your mother was a talented performer in her own right?

LAURA When I was 5 years old, I was coming up the stairs and I saw my mom standing there, singing ""A Quiet Thing"" a cappella, and it was such a differentiating moment for me. I realized that we are separate from each other -- she has dreams and goals. You weren't just there to bring me stuff. It stuck with me my whole life. 

LINDA You used to critique my voice students. This one particular student was not great. Laura was on my lap, I think you were about 2, and he sang and she looked at him and she went, ""No."" 

LAURA Telling people what to do since 1981. Linda, how could you be sure your professional assessments of Laura were objective, and not just coming from a place of motherly pride?

LAURA I'm actually interested in this answer as well. 

LINDA It's complicated. I was trying not to go, ""That's my daughter -- she's brilliant!,"" because I see a lot of moms like that. But as a voice teacher, I know someone's voice could develop really early and then plateau out. You wait and see. My husband and I both felt it was really important for her to develop who she is from the inside. 

LAURA You're going to get so much hate mail from the stage moms. The entire cast of ""School of Rock"" is going to come after you. What is it like now, to see Laura go through a negative experience, like not getting a role she wanted ... 

LAURA Never. No. Always got it. So, no that one.

... or getting a bad review? How do you process that as her mother?

LAURA How do you process that?

LINDA I think you process that like any parent would process anything that happens to their child. Having been in the industry before, I was probably more nervous than a normal parent would have been. And more excited than a normal parent. 

LAURA A bad review, you're like, meh. But when it's been personal, you want to protect me and correct someone's misinterpretation. Laura was in ""Gypsy,"" a show about a notorious stage mother who comes to resent her daughter for achieving a stardom she did not. Did you feel any of those feelings yourself?

LAURA She's like the opposite. Even in my speech, I called her the anti-Mama Rose. [Breathlessly] When I won the Tony Award. 

LINDA I never, ever felt, ""Oh, that should have been me."" Not in a million years. 

LAURA You were saying for years I should play her [Louise in ""Gypsy""]. 

LINDA There are a lot of roles that I always thought that about. Amalia [in ""She Loves Me""] was one of them. Louise was one of them. 

LAURA [Whispers] Say ""My Fair Lady."" 

LINDA And ""My Fair Lady"" is definitely one of them. Gee! Obviously. 

LAURA Good job. When did you commit to these concerts at Feinstein's/54 Below?

LAURA When I was pregnant, and, like, ""Being a mom's going to be easy!"" And now I'm like, ""Great."" 

LINDA It'll be fine. 

LAURA I'm excited to do this with you. I wish you had continued on, because you're so talented. I wish you'd been able to pursue that for yourself, and that you weren't in a position where you had to take care of me, and transition solely to being a voice teacher. I feel like 35 years later, you have an opportunity to share your gift with people, and it is a gift. Do you think Ella will follow in Laura's footsteps?

LAURA My husband was playing the piano for Ella -- he was playing ""Fur Elise,"" the only piano piece he remembers -- and her eyes welled up with tears. And we were like, whoa, O.K., that's a one-off. He did it again the next day -- same thing. 

LINDA She's going to sing. 

LAURA She better. 

LINDA Laura had a very husky voice when she was a baby. And as her mom, I thought, ""Where does she get this?"" We called her Moose. 

LAURA I've talked to a lot of therapists about this.","Laura Benanti, the Tony-winning actress and a new mother, talks with her own mom, Linda, a former stage actress and co-star of her new cabaret show.",07d6d8d7-f1fa-561c-881f-9f1b2039119d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/02/arts/02BENANTI1/02BENANTI1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=18ba908d8fe76e855794f41a1acbcbd77f18fa19e76c46c3fd89b5d246830185&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Linda Benanti; her daughter, Laura Benanti; and Laura's baby, Ella Rose Benanti-Brown.",07d6d8d7-f1fa-561c-881f-9f1b2039119d,N24News/imgs/07d6d8d7-f1fa-561c-881f-9f1b2039119d.jpg,10
Opinion,How to Fix the Coronavirus Testing Mess in 7 Days,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/opinion/coronavirus-testing.html,"The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was asked at a congressional hearing on Thursday who was in charge of making sure that people can be tested for Covid-19, especially health care workers.

Was it he, the vice president or someone else?

Dr. Robert Redfield, the C.D.C. director, replied that his responsibility was only to ensure that state public health laboratories have access to the test. Pressed further, he said he would look into who was in charge.

If he didn't know, that's a problem. On Friday morning, President Trump took a belated but welcome step by designating Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary of health, to be responsible for the government's testing response.

Media,"Traveling Is Stressful, but Do It With Us, Companies Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/business/media/travel-hotels-advertising.html,"Traveling Is Stressful, but Do It With Us, Companies Say

A contentious political climate has some Americans eager to escape, and a growing number of travel companies are tapping into that angst in a curiously effective way: by reminding them that travel can be cramped, hectic or disappointing. ""Take back what seat 34E took from you,"" one print advertisement in Westin Hotels & Resorts' new global ad campaign declares. Other ads in the new campaign, which was rolled out this month, refer to the disruption that being on the road can bring to sleep schedules, diets and workout plans. In one sense, the messaging builds on Westin's wellness-based brand image, highlighting its proprietary ""Heavenly Bed,"" healthy food offerings and activities like early-morning jogs. In another, it's anything but typical. Most hotel ads focus on the luxurious side of travel, without acknowledging that it can often be tiring, frustrating or painful.

""For a lot of people, travel is a bit of a disruption into your routine,"" said Will McGinness, a partner and the executive creative director at Venable, Bell & Partners, Westin's agency partner. ""Acknowledging that, leveraging that insight was important."" The idea that getting away from it all can be as stressful as what you're getting away from is one that has gained traction.

""Customers just really want a break,"" said Mariano Dima, global chief marketing officer for HomeAway, the home-rental site. HomeAway recently reprised a campaign it began a year ago that featured travelers in unpleasant or awkward situations on vacation -- tweaking traditional hotels and, with its depictions of partly clothed and poorly groomed hosts, its rival Airbnb.

Hilton Hotels & Resorts began a campaign last year that centered on the catchphrase ""Stop clicking around."" Ads showed people frustrated as they pecked away online, looking for the best price. (Hilton, like other hotel companies, would prefer to have guests book their rooms through its own site to avoid paying commissions to third-party sites and to maintain customer loyalty.) Although it might seem counterintuitive, acknowledging negativity can make a brand seem more credible. ""It can actually be a strategy to disarm consumers,"" said Derek Rucker, a professor of marketing at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. ""When you represent some of the potential negatives of a product or service, that actually makes me feel as if I'm better informed."" An October telephone survey commissioned by Westin found that while people planned to take more trips this year, a greater number found vacations more of a burden than business trips.

""When you really take time off on your vacation, there's a lot of pressure to make sure you maximize your time,"" he said. The Oregon Tourism Commission addressed this feeling last year with a campaign that heralded the state's outdoors activities -- and then reminded visitors that just relaxing is O.K., too. Video clips carried assurances like ""There are all kinds of things you can do in Oregon, but you don't have to do any of them"" and ""Looking at things is an activity."" Beyond the pressure people put on themselves, there is the stress caused by fellow travelers. ""Whether it's the train or on the roads or airplanes -- it's just the volume,"" Mr. Povinelli said. ""Everybody's gotten better about maximizing inventory. It's very rare when most of the seats aren't filled."" Like HomeAway's, other campaigns have capitalized on the idea that close quarters make for uncomfortable experiences.","Some hotels and airlines are acknowledging that travel is difficult and often frustrating. Disarming customers with straight talk, they hope, will prove attractive.",7f359208-0e63-5209-8945-bc7c2f41f52e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/21/business/23ADCO1/23ADCO1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=57dd5027c692cb00cdbb10e204aef67f3b4700b3d4204e5c027ea069c6de7cf8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An advertisement in Westin Hotels & Resorts' new global campaign.,7f359208-0e63-5209-8945-bc7c2f41f52e,N24News/imgs/7f359208-0e63-5209-8945-bc7c2f41f52e.jpg,16
Health,Mental Health Groups Split on Bill to Overhaul Care,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/03/health/mental-health-groups-split-on-bill-to-revamp-care.html,"Lawmakers, patient advocates and the millions of Americans living with a psychiatric diagnosis agree that the nation's mental health care system is broken, and on Thursday, Congress will hear testimony on the most ambitious overhaul plan in decades, a bill that has already stirred longstanding divisions in mental health circles. The prospects for the bill, proposed by Representative Tim Murphy, Republican of Pennsylvania, are uncertain, experts say, given partisanship in both the House and the Senate and the sheer complexity of the mental health system. And its backing of the expanded use of involuntary outpatient treatment has drawn opposition from some advocacy groups. But the bill, the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, does have more than a dozen Democratic co-sponsors in the House, and several mental health organizations are supporting it. Last week, both houses of Congress adopted one of its central provisions, expanding funding for outpatient treatment programs through other legislation. On Thursday, the House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee is scheduled to hear testimony on the entire bill, which includes more than two dozen measures. ""It's the most comprehensive mental health bill we've seen in a long, long time, and that in itself is an accomplishment,"" said Keris Myrick, chief executive of the Project Return Peer Support Network and president of the board of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, which supports some parts of the bill. ""I think almost everyone sees things in the bill that are long overdue, but also things they're very concerned about.""

Among those opposing the bill because of its involuntary treatment provisions is the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, whose president, Robert Bernstein, said, ""Many serious organizations seem to have an 'any port in the storm' mentality, supporting this bill even though it includes dangerous provisions."" Mr. Murphy, a clinical psychologist from Pittsburgh, put together the legislation at the behest of House Republican leaders after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. He spent a year hearing testimony about the current system, a patchwork of community clinics and state hospitals chronically short of funding that leaves millions of people with mental illness without treatment, often homeless or in prison. ""It's a broken system, and we're not going to fix it by throwing a little money here or there,"" Mr. Murphy said in an interview. ""We know that when people get care, they get better, but there are simply not many options: Clinics are reducing services, there are not enough psychiatrists or psychologists to go around -- we found all sorts of barriers to care."" Widely backed provisions of the bill include streamlining payment for services under the Medicaid program, and providing funds for clinics that meet standards for rigorous, scientifically supported care. The bill also provides money for suicide prevention programs and for so-called telepsychiatry, or remote video therapy, which is seen as especially crucial in rural areas.

Provisions calling for increased training for police officers and emergency medical workers in how to identify and treat people with mental disorders are also widely approved. The police and paramedics often act as ad hoc social workers, dealing with people with mental problems when they are hurt or break the law. About 350,000 Americans with a diagnosis of a severe mental illness like schizophrenia or bipolar disorder are in state jails and prisons, while the number of psychiatric beds available has shrunk to 35,000, according to a coming analysis by the Treatment Advocacy Center, a nonprofit group that favors expanded access to treatment. ""The situation has been getting progressively worse for 50 years, to the point where we now have 10 times more people with severe mental illness in prisons and jails than in mental hospitals,"" said Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, of the Stanley Medical Research Institute, a nonprofit organization supporting research in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and a strong supporter of the bill. But the bill's backing for involuntary treatment is highly contentious. It would provide state grants for so-called assisted outpatient treatment programs under which certain mentally ill people with a history of legal or other problems get court-ordered therapy, which in most cases means trying to ensure they take their medication. The result: more people treated earlier, and more treated against their will. ""This becomes a civil rights issue quickly, and it can drive people away from seeking services when they fear treatment will be forced on them or they'll be locked up,"" said Gina Nikkel, president and chief executive of the Foundation for Excellence in Mental Health Care, which advocates a more holistic, less medication-oriented approach to recovery. In the last two decades, 45 states have adopted laws allowing compelled treatment in some cases, with varying requirements and levels of enforcement. Kendra's Law, passed in New York in 1999, is one that researchers have monitored closely. One recent analysis, led by investigators at Duke University, found that since the law was passed, patients were much less likely to land back in the hospital or be arrested. Mental health and Medicaid costs for them dropped by about half. But involuntary treatment programs have led thousands of former psychiatric patients to become fierce critics of the mental health system.

Dr. Bernstein of the Bazelon Center and Dr. Nikkel said that extending such programs would ""eviscerate civil right protections"" and further erode trust between patient and provider. The Murphy bill also proposes amending federal medical privacy protections -- the now-familiar Hipaa laws -- to allow parents or other caregivers access to a patient's medical information. Under current law, those records are private once a person becomes an adult, and as a result, caregivers are often effectively cut out of treatment decisions. The bill seeks to bring them back in, with a provision that will also generate strong political resistance, experts said. Finally, the bill proposes to sharply scale back many of the programs funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. This agency, with a $3.6 billion budget, has long financed programs that critics say are not backed by good evidence. ""When something has been funded for a long time, it's tough to let it go,"" Mr. Murphy said. ""What we're saying is that if a program works, then show us the evidence that it does, and we'll keep it. If the evidence is not there, then the taxpayers shouldn't pay for it.""","As Congress takes up a proposal by a Republican representative, Tim Murphy, advocates divide over its expansion of involuntary treatment programs.",7fb187d7-8bd5-5e11-a8fa-20f69aa91a27,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/03/us/MURPHY/MURPHY-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=b4512ffaff6771646a8af82c4ca867966717a79461da5c13bd7d35c7babfa16d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Congress will hear testimony on Thursday on a bill proposed by Representative Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania.,7fb187d7-8bd5-5e11-a8fa-20f69aa91a27,N24News/imgs/7fb187d7-8bd5-5e11-a8fa-20f69aa91a27.jpg,1
Science,"Amid a Graying Fleet of Nuclear Plants, a Hunt for Solutions",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/science/nuclear-energy-power-plants-advanced-reactors.html,"The H.B. Robinson nuclear power plant, about 70 miles from Columbia, S.C., has been producing electricity with few interruptions since the Nixon administration. But as of now, its fate is clear: The plant will have to shut down by 2030, when it will be six decades old. The Robinson reactor is one of the oldest still operating in the United States, but others are getting on in years. From 2029 to 2035, three dozen of the nation's 99 reactors, representing more than a third of the industry's generating capacity, will face closure as their operating licenses expire. Any shutdowns would be another blow to nuclear energy, which provides 19 percent of the nation's electricity but has struggled in recent years to compete against subsidized solar and wind power and plants that burn low-priced natural gas. Industry advocates say that by removing sources of clean electricity -- a nuclear reaction produces no carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases -- the closings could affect the government's ability to fulfill its pledge, made at the Paris climate talks last year, to reduce emissions. And to continue to meet the nation's electrical load, new generating capacity will have to be built to replace any that is lost.

""Some of those plants are going to be retiring,"" said Stephen E. Kuczynski, the chief executive of Southern Company's nuclear subsidiary. ""Which means we're going to need to meet this load with something."" Given the sometimes glacial pace of design, licensing and construction in the nuclear industry, the 2030s are not far-off. Plant operators may be able to buy time by seeking license extensions for another 20 years from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or by building more large reactors like four that are under construction. The industry and the Department of Energy are also pinning their hopes on the development of less conventional reactor designs that are meant to be safer and cheaper to build and operate. Yet it is unclear whether any new designs could reach the market in time to make a dent in the generating capacity lost as plants are closed. Some in the industry are bullish, including Southern, which announced in January that it would receive up to $40 million from the Department of Energy to develop an advanced reactor that uses molten salt as a coolant instead of water, which all current designs use. ""Our target is -- can we really move the process forward and have a commercial option by 2030?"" Mr. Kuczynski said. To do that, he and others say, the pace of the design process, and of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's review process, needs to be sped up.

But some say the shortened timetables are unrealistic, given safety and other concerns and the need to test new designs before seeking approval from the commission. ""It's a 25-year process, no matter what,"" said Michael McGough, the chief commercial officer of NuScale Power, which is the furthest along among companies working on less conventional reactors. NuScale's design, called a small modular reactor, uses water as a coolant, but the units are far smaller than current reactors and have advanced safety features. They could be built largely in a factory, saving money, and up to 12 of them could be installed at one site. Mr. McGough knows all about long timetables; NuScale's design has been under development since 2000. It has lined up a potential first customer, Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems, or Uamps, which operates in the Intermountain West, and hopes to have 12 of the small reactors operating at a site in Idaho by the mid-2020s. ""It's improbable to me that you will see any new design developed or licensed in a much shorter time frame than the kind we're on,"" Mr. McGough said. NuScale has been testing its design for 13 years, using a nonnuclear prototype. Later this year, it plans to submit an 11,000-page application to the N.R.C. to have its design certified. The commission then has up to 40 months to review the application. The certification process, and a later application by Uamps for a construction and operating license, could be delayed if the N.R.C. asks for more information. But even if all goes smoothly, the plant will produce only about half the electricity of many existing reactors. About 50 of these 12-reactor plants would be needed to replace the generating capacity that could be lost by 2035. Many in the industry hope that extending the licenses of existing reactors will forestall at least some closings. Nuclear plants were originally licensed for 40 years, but almost all have sought and received 20-year extensions.

The regulatory commission has begun researching what would be required to extend a plant's life to 80 years. ""We're asking very basic questions, like how long can a reactor vessel remain acceptable since it's being bombarded by neutrons,"" said Scott Burnell, a spokesman. ""The information we have at this point is that those are issues that are not showstoppers."" So far one operator has announced plans to seek such an extension, for two reactors set to close in the early 2030s, but an application and possible approval are still years away. Duke Energy, owner of the Robinson plant in South Carolina, said it was evaluating whether to pursue an extension.

Given the relatively poor economics of nuclear power, however, even if a plant could be licensed to operate up to 80 years, the question remains whether it would be financially worthwhile for it to do so, especially if expensive work is required. Skeptics cite two American plants that have been closed for economic reasons since 2012, after their licenses were extended to 60 years. Similar economic uncertainties surround the latest generation of reactors, the Westinghouse AP1000, a design that is similar in many respects to existing units but has safety improvements and cost-saving features. Four of these are being built in the United States, and there have been lengthy construction delays and ballooning costs. But Mr. Kuczynski of Southern, which is building two of the reactors in Georgia, said the industry was learning from experience, which would lower the cost of subsequent plants. ""We're going to get through the first of a kind,"" he said, and any future orders ""are going to be just terrific bargains."" Others are not so sure the industry will rush to build more. ""What eventually happens with the four AP1000s will be very important,"" said Matthew McKinzie, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""If the economics of extending the lifetime of a plant to 80 years are poor, then what does that say about the economics of a new plant?""","To avoid a shortage of generating capacity in coming decades, the industry is looking at options like advanced reactors and licensing extensions.",6fb247a5-8213-5abc-9040-54d01e3c8a73,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/22/science/22NUCLEARJP/22NUCLEARJP-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=c36ccc0f7b12191659a01bb9c6d5c70fa81376e67c310adb93aafdd5fa86ba6e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The H.B.

Books,"'Bestiary' Offers a Compendium of Creatures, and Generations",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/books/review/bestiary-k-ming-chang.html,"All unnamed, mother, daughter and grandmother are inextricably linked by the fantastical beasts that birthed them and ultimately bind them together across oceans, states and cities. The story of Hu Gu Po, a tiger spirit who wishes to live inside the body of a woman, but can only do so if she eats children, becomes the central force in the young daughter's life. As she finds herself growing a tiger's tail, she begins to realize her own power, and how that power leashes her to the generations of women before her. The tail helps her see herself both as her family's protector and as a burgeoning romantic conqueror. In both cases she's unsure of who ultimately wields her newfound power: the woman or the tiger.

""Bestiary"" floats in and out of fantasy, layering its airy legends of imaginary creatures with the grounding reality of building a life in a new country, of severing the ties with your past so you can lay claim to a future you can call your own. Children inherit their parents' trauma, settle the moral score their parents have racked up.

At the same time that it lays bare the ground that shaped this particular family, ""Bestiary"" also paints a portrait of Taiwanese identity, poking at the various histories and horrors that built the island and its citizens. A place where ""Ma doesn't measure her life in years but in languages: Tayal and Yilan Creole in the indigo fields where she was born ... Japanese during the war, Mandarin in the Nationalist-eaten city. Each language worn outside her body, clasped around her throat like a collar."" From pirates to soldiers and those who came before, the men who claimed Taiwan and the women who sustained it, the country's evolution is as much a part of the book's collection of beasts as is the tiger spirit.

And in retelling so many of Taiwan's legends, Chang manages to create new ones, filling pages with hopeful, queer love, from lost pirates creating a crab daughter born from their passion, to young girls hungrily discovering sex and friendship in the salt of their bodies.

Chang's poetry lifts her prose, creating a hybrid voice that lends itself well to the magic realism at play throughout the novel even if it becomes muddied at times, flitting between the parsed lines of myth and the frenzied language of adolescence.","K-Ming Chang's debut novel tells the stories of three generations of Taiwanese women through the beasts, both real and mythical, they encounter.",d7658cbd-22a9-5518-9781-d55290c92fb2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/15/books/review/Niazi1/Niazi1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=269&w=515&s=8681b368c76194b135635f8728d81035bd9df4613443a778b3b5266adbd4c64e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"In retelling so many of Taiwan's legends, K-Ming Chang manages to create new ones.",d7658cbd-22a9-5518-9781-d55290c92fb2,N24News/imgs/d7658cbd-22a9-5518-9781-d55290c92fb2.jpg,13
Art & Design,"A Festival of New Asian Art, Seeking a Direction",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/arts/design/asian-art-triennial-review.html,"You could find reasons for both enthusiasm and skepticism when Asia Society announced last year that it would present a triennial of contemporary art, centered on art from what the organizers called ""Asia and the world."" Enthusiasm: Our supposedly global galleries and museums still engage too little with a continent that's home to 60 percent of the world's population, and the more new Asian art we see here, the better. And admission would be free. Skepticism: There are now more than 300 biennial and triennial exhibitions of contemporary art worldwide. In New York alone, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the New Museum, MoMA PS1, the Queens Museum, El Museo del Barrio, the International Center of Photography and the Wallach Art Gallery at Columbia University all gum up their galleries with perennial festivals of new art. In the high-water years of globalization -- the '90s and early 2000s -- the -ennial exhibitions popping up all over promised to forge a new, worldwide field of artistic creation, with the West no longer at the center. Twenty-odd years later, when digital networks have dissolved distances and novelty seems an artistic nonstarter, the format is feeling increasingly tired. ""We Do Not Dream Alone,"" the inaugural Asia Society Triennial, was meant to spill out of the institution's Park Avenue headquarters, with major commissions on Governors Island and participatory installations in partnership with the New York Philharmonic. The coronavirus pandemic -- which, among its other injuries, has brought anti-Asian prejudice to an appalling boil in the United States -- pushed almost all the largest projects out of reach, and made it impossible for most artists to travel. What is left is a scattershot, unadventurous assortment of new and not-so-new art, which barely reflects the ambitions espoused in those initial announcements. It feels less like a calamity than a missed opportunity, and might have benefited from a longer postponement and rethink.

About two dozen artists, from the Middle East to Indonesia to New York, have works on view at Asia Society's headquarters. (They were selected by Boon Hui Tan, the recently departed director of the Asia Society museum, and Michelle Yun Mapplethorpe, now promoted to the directorship. A second round of artists will take over the galleries in February.) There are a few of note, including Arpita Singh, an Indian artist born a decade before partition, whose forceful, thickly daubed paintings of fleshy and contorted women imbricate mythic and everyday imagery.

Quite a bit more of the art here is easily summarized and biennial-ready, as if communicating a single social or geopolitical concern was all a picture or an object can do. Ghiora Aharoni, a New York-based Israeli designer, embroiders gowns with eyeroll-inducing hybrid scripts of Hebrew and Arabic, Hindi and Urdu. Nasim Nasr, born in Iran and based in Australia, gives us a short video loop of women breaking apart religious prayer beads; you do not need the accompanying text to know they are ""metaphorically defying patriarchal traditions."" A second segment of the triennial, staged across Central Park in a large gallery of the New-York Historical Society, purports to strike up a conversation between that museum's collection and contemporary Asian artists. But the hang is soporific -- there is not a single internal wall; old and new art is strung monotonously along the perimeter like so many PowerPoint slides -- and the juxtapositions are frequently forced. Thomas Cole's monumental five-painting cycle ""The Course of Empire"" (1833--36) is placed as a mirror-image of photographs of the artist Huang Yan, whose torso is tattooed with traditional Chinese landscapes. As for the hasty co-optation of a vernacular painting of George Floyd, plus a poster with a raised fist sloganed ""Asians for Black Lives,"" they ought to confirm that this show could have used a longer delay to think more systematically about the upheavals of 2020.

There are, still and all, high points. New Yorkers have had few opportunities before to discover the work of Minouk Lim, one of the most important artists in South Korea, and at Asia Society a whole gallery is given to her disquieting mannequins and to her video ""It's a Name I Gave Myself,"" a harrowing edit of footage from a 1983 television special featuring orphaned survivors of the Korean War, uncertain of their whereabouts or even their own given names. The hushed landscape photography of Taca Sui, at the Historical Society, and Xu Bing's silk-woven copy of Confucius's ""Analects,"" at Asia Society, offer pensive, knotty updates to the Chinese classical tradition. And maybe there will be surprises when the second group of participants appears in February; they include the Indonesian artist Melati Suryodarmo, renowned for her grueling durational performances, and Ahmet Ogut, an incisive Turkish artist of Kurdish descent.

But bringing these artists and others together under one umbrella feels, at best, haphazard. This is a triennial in search of a reason for being -- although that does not make it so different from hundreds of others. Starting with the Gwangju Biennale in South Korea in 1995, the biennial/triennial format became decisive for the development of Asian contemporary art at the end of the last century. In Yokohama or Singapore, in Taipei or in Kochi, India, these festivals served as mixing points for artists East and West, brought Asian artists into a global orbit, and eventually became an ecosystem of their own. They talked a big game about ""knowledge production"" and ""transnational discourses,"" even as biennials started to seem more satisfying for tourist boards and corporate sponsors than for artists. What should an -ennial be now, as we approach the quarter-way mark of the 21st century? The ""new art from all over"" model of the 2000s feels more and more like a dead end. The pandemic's sudden deceleration of the art world offers a chance at least to try something more tightly argued or historically engaged, so that when the motors of the market start revving again we at least know where we want to steer. Between the shortcomings of our ""global"" shows and the timidity of our ""local"" ones lie a thousand possible encounters, where we can meet in ways that truly change us.

Fashion & Style,Opening New York Men's Fashion Week: A Show With No Men,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/fashion/new-york-mens-fashion-week-krammer-stoudt.html,"Looks from the Krammer & Stoudt fall 2018 collection. The models are Madison Paige, Arta Gjonbalaj and Terra Juano, who is known as TJ.

Is the future of men's wear nonbinary people? It is if the designers behind the indie label Krammer & Stoudt are to be believed. In just five seasons, Mike Rubin and Courtenay Nearburg, who are married, have proved themselves a pair worth watching. (Last month Mr. Rubin, 59, was awarded the Fashion Group International's Rising Star award.) The couple's shrewdly assembled collections have played on influences that ranged unfettered from the German Neo-Expressionist dandy Markus Lupertz to the Orange County surf culture memorialized in the novels of Kem Nunn (sometimes referred to as surf fiction's dark lord) to the live-rough transients known as gutter punks. This season, Krammer & Stoudt summoned shades of the playwright Sam Shepard to create a collection ostensibly influenced by Mr. Shepard's seldom-performed ""Cowboy Mouth"" (written with Patti Smith), and yet more notably inspired by the thrill Ms. Nearburg felt when she stumbled last year upon Terra Juano, a model known on Instagram (@Renegades_) as TJ, or Skinnybonejones.

Dressed for the Krammer & Stoudt show in a rejiggered hooded Army M65 fishtail parka, its body elongated and its sleeves shortened; a patch-pocket wool shirt that looked like a supersize version of a standard-issue Pendleton; a pair of drawstring wool trousers Mr. Rubin based on a favorite pair of vintage Capri pants; and a high-crowned Esenshel rabbit velour hat with a brim the size of a cartwheel, TJ looked like an incredibly cool butch girl or a very pretty femme boy or both at once or something altogether in-between. Like many of the models cast for the show -- among them Madison Paige (@madspaige), Arta Gjonbalaj (@artagee), Rain Dove (@raindovemodel) and Merika Palmiste (@merikatheone) -- TJ identifies as nonbinary. And the lineup may reflect a reality the fashion world has been struggling to accommodate -- mashed-up men's and women's shows is one example -- for some time. ""There is this evolution happening -- as opposed to a revolution -- of people recognizing themselves outside of gender specificity,"" Ms. Nearburg wrote in an email before what would be the first men's wear show in this observer's memory in which not a single model was male.

""Krammer & Stoudt has a loyal following among nonbinary people, L.G.B.T.Q. women and straight women,"" she wrote. ""Often we are asked if it's 'okay' for these people to buy our clothes. Of course it's okay."" What is more, Ms. Nearburg said on Monday, recognizing an inevitable tropism away from traditionally defined gender identities opens up not only potential new markets, but also many design possibilities. ""The practical reason for doing this is that people like TJ and Mads and those in their generation or younger are not comfortable confining themselves to a gender definition any more,"" Ms. Nearburg said. Yet, as she learned during her years in the 1990s punk scene in Austin, Tex., gender play as a way of subverting societal norms is one of fashion's time-honored tools. Back when her club uniform was a sleeveless man's T-shirt, a leather biker jacket and trousers, Ms. Nearburg found that her apparent androgyny made her attractive across the spectrum of gender identities. ""I was hit on by straight men, gay men, gay women, straight women,"" she said. ""That was part of my inspiration for doing the casting this way,"" she said. ""We're deliberately not casting feminine-presenting men because we're doing a masculine show. It's still men's wear we're dealing with here. We wanted masculine-presenting women, androgynous women, gay women who consider themselves female, nonbinary women, because we wanted to demonstrate how that space is opening up at a culturally regressive time."" There was something else. ""You look at people like TJ and Madison and they are just so badass and cool,"" Ms. Nearburg said.",The award-winning indie label Krammer & Stoudt reaches beyond gender to cast its models.,41aa62a1-cdf0-5212-8dd7-59d0afa849d9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/05/fashion/05Krammer-Stoudt-1/05Krammer-Stoudt-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=cf2126b31be6e8e4c563159a3281c0f8a591f587615a7fa9de88ec48e1522b07&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Looks from the Krammer &amp; Stoudt fall 2018 collection.

Real Estate,"For Holdout Renters, Condo Conversions Can Be Messy",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/realestate/for-holdout-renters-condo-conversions-can-be-messy.html,"In New York, elbowing aside others to make money in real estate is as old as the founding of the city itself. And for every rental building that has been converted to a co-op or condominium over the years, there have been tenants who have felt the sharp jab. This time around, with apartment sales on the upswing and the number of rent-regulated tenants on the decline, many of the buildings that developers are converting from rental to condo are large and located in areas that are pricey and desirable. And unlike the 1980s, when scores of buildings were converted to co-ops, the fabulous insider deal no longer exists. But some things remain constant. Those who insist on hanging on to their rental apartments can expect a noisy, dusty mess. ""This is one of the hairiest times for renters that I've seen in my career,"" said Kevin R. McConnell, a real estate lawyer who has focused on tenants' rights since the 1980s. ""There's tremendous upheaval in the market.""

To their defenders, conversions are hardly an across-the-board bogeyman. They note that many renters move away after a few years anyway, as part of the natural ebb and flow of buildings. Still others, they say, wind up with fancy condos purchased at a discount. And the renters who remain often benefit from spiffed-up facades, upgraded swimming pools and new elevators. As for construction clatter while a building is undergoing a makeover? Just another annoyance, they say, in a city that shrieks with car alarms and sirens. But tenants in general are feeling more pain than in the past. Complaints about harassment, lack of heat and rent increases are rising, according to several government organizations that track them. And local government officials are taking notice; last month, a new joint city and state task force was created to crack down on landlords using disruptive renovations to push tenants out of rent-regulated homes. ""To take a building like this and do what they have done is horrible,"" said Avra Petrides, a renter at the Evelyn at 101 West 78th Street since 1958, referring to the number of interior walls that have been removed at the building, whose exterior is a designated landmark. The copper-red 1886 building, which is among the city's oldest apartment houses, is being converted to a condo by Newcastle Realty Services, with GTIS Partners, an investment firm. At least it was being converted until the state attorney general halted the project in January over concerns that tenants may have been given the boot illegally.

Ms. Petrides, who is in her late 70s, lives in one of the 11 apartments that are still occupied in the building, which originally had 44 units. Newcastle wants to reduce the number of apartments to 24 to create roomier units, according to design plans. ""Suddenly, I was living in a dust bowl,"" said Ms. Petrides, an actress and playwright whose two-bedroom, with parquet floors and a pair of fireplaces, is rent-controlled, at about $830 a month -- a rent that many would consider tantamount to winning the lottery. Rent-controlled apartments have a rent that is generally the lowest in the rent-regulated category. Rent-regulated tenants are strongly protected against eviction. They can be forced out if a building is being demolished, but they can't be thrown to the curb in a conversion. All renters are entitled to have first dibs on buying their homes, and they also have months to mull over the decision. If rent-regulated tenants decide to stay, they are supposed to have the same livable space as before. But Newcastle appears to have violated a few rules at the Evelyn, according to the attorney general's office, in that it may have induced people to leave well before the conversion plan was made official or before they had a chance to consider whether they wanted to buy there. According to court papers, both rent-regulated and market-rate tenants were cleared out before the developers had the official O.K. to put apartments on the market, which is illegal.

Newcastle ""engaged in what can only be a deliberate campaign to deceive the tenants at 101 West 78th Street and to move them out of the building as quickly as possible,"" prosecutors said in court documents. The investigation is ongoing, a spokeswoman for the attorney general said. In the meantime, the building, which has a large ""Hard Hat Area"" sign hanging inside its front door, has a rough work-in-progress ambience. In early March, there were several open building code violations at the site, according to Department of Buildings records, including seven for Class 1 violations, for immediately hazardous conditions. Separately, Newcastle has also been cited for improper asbestos removal. Margaret Streicker Porres, Newcastle's president, declined to comment, ""since this is an ongoing legal matter,"" according to an email from George Arzt, a spokesman. Complaints about overall tenant harassment appear to be escalating in New York, although it is difficult to know how many are from renters displaced or inconvenienced by conversions and how many are, say, routine heat or water problems. In the fiscal year that ended in 2013, the city's housing court received 752 harassment complaints, Mayor Bill de Blasio said last month at a news conference. This year, as of mid-February, 426 complaints have been made, he said. The number of condo conversions has been relatively steady in recent years. At the height of the last construction boom in 2007, 20 rental buildings in Manhattan gave way to condos, according to an analysis of filings provided by the attorney general's office. In 2013, 14 similar conversions took place, with others pending approval, and in 2014, 15 were planned. Today's conversions are concentrated in prime neighborhoods, often in large, well-known buildings. But in 2007, about 50 percent of the projects were way uptown, in Harlem or Washington Heights. By 2013, however, only about 20 percent were in those northern Manhattan neighborhoods, with the balance in places like the Upper West Side, Gramercy Park and Midtown.

Over the years, developers have found it easier to convert rental buildings. Changes to housing laws in the 1990s made deregulation easier. Citywide, 256,952 apartments have left the rent-regulation program since 1994, according to a report last year from the New York City Rent Guidelines Board. And even though rent-regulated units have also been created along the way, the report said, there has almost always been a net decrease each year. But while there may be more apartments to buy, they're not coming as affordable as they once did. During the wave of rental-to-co-op conversions in the 1980s, the ""insider price"" offered to tenants could be as little as 50 percent of the market price. Developers needed to fill a certain number of apartments in their buildings to qualify for conversions, and offering discounted units to current renters was a surefire way of doing so. Renters sometimes banded together to hold out for a lower price. In today's white-hot sales market, though, there's much less risk that units will go unsold, and so steep discounts are not as necessary. At Carnegie Park, a brick 1980s rental going condo at 200 East 94th Street and Third Avenue, the discount rate is about 10 percent, according to the Related Companies, the building's developer.

""It breaks my heart; I really felt trapped,"" he said. ""There is no respect or appreciation for the people who live here."" A ""handful"" of renters, however, had purchased apartments in the building by early March, said Vanessa Morin, a spokeswoman for the project, with more expected by a deadline this spring. Ms. Morin added that while Related did not discount rents, tenants could move to other Related rentals, or anywhere else for that matter, without penalties for breaking their leases. Housing advocates are on guard about situations in which construction noise and mess compromises the ""warranty of habitability"" that is a tenant's right. ""Harassment can play out subtly,"" said Benjamin Dulchin, the executive director of the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development, an advocacy group. ""A pattern can add up that tenants are really not welcome. It can create this subtle pressure that pushes tenants out."" In February, the offices of the governor, the attorney general and the mayor formed the Tenant Harassment Prevention Task Force, which ""will confront the rise in complaints that landlords are using a variety of tactics, including disruptive and dangerous renovation and construction projects, to force tenants into vacating rent-regulated apartments,"" according to a statement. And that crackdown could involve criminal charges, said Eric T. Schneiderman, the state attorney general.

But for Ms. Burstein, the move was in many ways a case of going from the frying pan to the fire. That's because HFZ is also converting the Chatsworth to a condo, and the noise is so loud that Ms. Burstein has to wear headphones to work in her apartment. And what was supposed to be a temporary visit has turned into a 19-month stay, ""with no end in sight,"" she said. In the meantime, Ms. Burstein and HFZ have tangled over pipes that were run through her original apartment and covered by bumped-out walls, making the livable space smaller, she said. There was also damage to a bathroom. Last fall, she sued HFZ over those alterations. Although a judge allowed the pipes to stay, Ms. Burstein said, she is negotiating to have the developer repair the bathroom. She also seeks to have an office reconfigured, because her photograph printer will no longer fit in the rejiggered room. Over the course of those talks, she said, HFZ offered to buy her out for $1 million, which she declined. Apartments at the Marquand have sold for between $14 million and $22 million since HFZ bought the building in 2012, according to StreetEasy. About 17 of the 25 planned units are in new hands. In the end, Ms. Burstein said she just wants to move back to the Marquand and continue renting there. As to the $1 million she said she was offered: ""I'm not saying that's not a great deal of money -- it is. But the reality is, I need a home and I'm not ready to leave New York."" One of today's more prolific converters, HFZ, which declined to comment through a spokeswoman, is working on or has plans for about a half-dozen condo projects in Manhattan, including Nos. 90 and 88 Lexington Avenue, by Gramercy Park, as well as 301 West 53rd Street, a brick postwar tower in Midtown. HFZ is also planning to convert the Belnord Apartments, a rental with about 200 units at 225 West 86th Street, according to an HFZ spokeswoman, though the company's purchase of the building has not yet closed, according to city records.

Its appeal may be obvious: A decade ago, more than five dozen tenants -- about a third of the building -- gave up their rent-regulated status as part of an unusual deal to avoid shouldering the cost of building repairs, and are now in market-rate apartments. For those rent-regulated tenants who are determined to be holdouts in converted rentals, rough patches may await. At the Chatsworth, for instance, most renters won't have the air-conditioning enjoyed by apartment owners. And the dust flying at the building, a co-op that began sales in January, has led to sinus infections, said Naomi Greenberg, 59. She said she has had to wash her dishes in a bathtub because of a regular lack of hot water at her sink. She would move if she could, added Ms. Greenberg, a chef, nanny and college student. But HFZ will not pay her the $750,000 she thinks her rent-stabilized lease is worth, she said. Buying her two-bedroom for $1.775 million is not in the cards, Ms. Greenberg said, considering that she makes about $50,000 a year. In the meantime, she's enlisted Adam Leitman Bailey, a real estate lawyer who has sued many major developers including Related, the Extell Development Company and the Trump Organization, to investigate suing HFZ for harassment. ""I've decided to stay and buckle down,"" Ms. Greenberg said.","With conversions on the upswing, some renters are finding staying put a dusty and noisy option.",710711e5-a866-525c-a3ee-de220489c191,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/15/realestate/15COV1/15COV1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=4bfec88a04a6edacb2440d8d00590b6a271c8f9bee07ad2401b41ef8dac5eb77&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Avra Petrides, a rent-controlled tenant at the Evelyn on West 78th Street, in the hallway outside her door.

Automobiles,A Special on His Menu,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/automobiles/collectibles/06EGO.html,"LATE in 2009, not long after finishing construction work on Saraghina, his carefully considered pizzeria-restaurant that occupies a street corner in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, Massimiliano Nanni bought a '65 Ford Econoline pickup.

""Just a moped. In the summer, the people would come to the beach."" He wanted Saraghina, named for a Fellini character, to have a similarly laid-back vibe. With whitewashed walls built of reclaimed wood and mismatched everything, the restaurant, designed by his wife, Paola Citerrio, has the comfortable aura of a rustic country house.

The others saw several whales. Mr. Nanni saw one. ""I get seasick,"" he said, explaining that he had retired below deck. ""And I was a fisherman. I used to get seasick in Italy when I fished for clams."" Mr. Nanni looked ready to shove off to sea, wearing a striped T-shirt, a blue shirt over it, a red shirt over that and a deep blue Patagonia parka. He had tan corduroy pants and shoes, and a white apron hung from his waist. Instead, he was headed across Brooklyn to pick up his son from preschool. He slung a bag over his shoulders, said goodbye to his wife and trundled off into the bitter cold. Parked on the street, the Econoline was marginally fenced in by fresh snow. Mr. Nanni tossed his bag behind the driver's seat and hopped in. The truck started right up.

""I didn't drive it for a couple of weeks,"" he said, recalling an earlier demonstration of the old Ford's reliability. ""It's the winter. I turned the key  it starts right up."" Inside, the truck has two seats, and that's pretty much it. Everything is metal, with no visible frills other than the upholstery on the seats. The steering wheel, as big as one in a bus, and the gearshift, which pokes out from a slot on the floor, seem to be the only controls.

The truck, which is dark blue beneath a thick layer of filth composed of snow, salt and sand, fit the vision that he and his wife hold for Saraghina  and for a new Mediterranean bistro, Celestino, that he plans to open in the same neighborhood this year. When people see the vintage truck, Mr. Nanni said, ""They understand the restaurant."" Mr. Nanni bought the Econoline on eBay, from a seller in Texas, for $5,000. There have been no problems with it, though he admits that the sagging rear suspension needs some attention  while hauling a refrigerator for Celestino, the rear tires rubbed against the wheel wells. In many ways, the Econoline of the 1960s was built more to capture a spirit of the times than to provide sturdy utility. (That's what the F-Series pickups were for.) Introducing the Econoline as a 1961 model, Ford was seen as chasing the success that Volkswagen was enjoying with its quirky Type 2 Microbus. Based on the compact Falcon economy car, the Econoline model range also included a passenger van and a delivery van. The design featured a forward driving position, with the front wheels almost directly under the front seats  the only seats in the pickup version  and the in-line 6-cylinder engine positioned between the seats.

Chevrolet based its van on the Corvair platform and called it the Corvair 95. Dodge had the A100, which became extremely popular after a racer named Bill Golden converted one into the Little Red Wagon, a Hemi-powered exhibitionist known for its improbable wheelies on the dragstrip. Mr. Nanni, who is also a co-owner of Piadina, a restaurant in Greenwich Village, said his garrulous nature has been a secret to his success. ""The trick is, I like my job,"" he said. ""I like to meet other people. I like talking a lot."" His conversations center on restaurants: what it takes to succeed, how much luck is involved and most of all, how lucky he has been. ""All my life I was very lucky,"" he said. ""My mother was very young when I was born. She watched her money. We worked all the time. I grew up in the restaurant.""

""I remember the father, he wasn't able to work because he was too old,"" he said. ""He had five sons. All the brothers worked over there. We're talking about 55- to 65-year-old Italian men. Even if the father wasn't able to work, he would always sit in the line with the customer, talking with the people, because he didn't have anything else to do. He spent all his life in that store. And this is what I want to do. I want to maybe be in a chair one day."" But now it was 3 p.m., and Ercole was waiting to be picked up. Mr. Nanni got in the truck, drove a few blocks, found parking next to a snow bank and disappeared inside the preschool.","Not long after finishing work on his new Brooklyn restaurant, Massimiliano Nanni bought a 1965 Ford Econoline pickup.",eab23dda-6dcd-5163-b13d-feb731a3cd0a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/02/06/automobiles/EGO-1/EGO-1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=315&w=600&s=a3d9ad1fe5ff5caa77ec3d92d5b4831d8a02bb495b0855e154a8866c56f82f78&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"RUSTIC When people see Massimiliano Nanni's truck, they understand his restaurant.",eab23dda-6dcd-5163-b13d-feb731a3cd0a,N24News/imgs/eab23dda-6dcd-5163-b13d-feb731a3cd0a.jpg,23
Food,Legacy Records Lends Several Dining Options to Hudson Yards,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/dining/legacy-records-nyc-restaurant-news.html,"LEGACY RECORDS Something of a pioneering spirit has driven the chef Ryan Hardy and his partners Robert Bohr and Grant Reynolds, of Charlie Bird and Pasquale Jones, to open their third restaurant, in a new residential building at the edge of the Hudson Yards development. ""This is an underserved neighborhood,"" Mr. Hardy said. The restaurant, named for the recording studio once housed at its address, is starting with a breakfast and lunch cafe in the front half of the space, serving what Mr. Hardy calls ""chef-driven food,"" not the usual muffins and egg sandwiches. It has a handsome sweep of bar for drinks and dining, and a marble bar for wine, with comfortable seating. By night this area will become a wine bar and dining counter with the same menu as the airy dining room beyond. The design, by Ken Fulk of San Francisco, suggests midcentury modern. The dinner menu is what Mr. Hardy calls ""more uptown"" than those at his other restaurants, with less Neapolitan fire, more Piedmontese complexity and a greater focus on seafood. The winter menu has a crudo section and dishes like crispy sunchokes with puntarelle, chestnut tagliatelle with duck ragu and duck offal, and Icelandic sea trout with pickled fennel and horseradish. Arvid Rosengren, an award-winning sommelier, is a partner here and has assembled a mostly French and Italian wine list. Upstairs is another bar with a lively mural to set the scene, and Jeff Bell of PDT consulting on the drinks.

OXBOW TAVERN The chef and restaurateur Tom Valenti is back on the Upper West Side. Having closed the much-loved Ouest in 2015 and done a brief stint at Le Cirque, he is opening this neighborhood bistro in the former Cafe Tallulah space. The name, however, has a longer history because the location once housed the Cuban restaurant Victor's Cafe; near the front door there's still a mural of oxen pulling a wagonload of sugar cane. Mr. Valenti said he is doing a quick turnaround, some cosmetic changes but nothing major. ""The idea of spending months and millions decorating is too difficult these days,"" he said. The food will have some signature dishes like salmon gravlax and a frisee salad with artichokes and mussels and, occasionally, his braised lamb shank. Also on the menu are a burger, a fried chicken sandwich, seared halibut with cauliflower puree and assorted simply grilled items. Downstairs, Mr. Valenti plans occasional dinner-party-style dinners starting in the spring. (Wednesday): 240 Columbus Avenue (71st Street), 646-490-4075, oxbowtavern.com.

Technology,"Amazon Bans, Then Reinstates, Hitler's 'Mein Kampf'",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/technology/amazon-hitler-mein-kampf.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Amazon quietly banned Adolf Hitler's manifesto ""Mein Kampf"" late last week, part of its accelerating efforts to remove Nazi and other hate-filled material from its bookstore, before quickly reversing itself.

The retailer, which controls the majority of the book market in the United States, is caught between two demands that cannot be reconciled. Amazon is under pressure to keep hate literature off its vast platform at a moment when extremist impulses seem on the rise. But the company does not want to be seen as the arbiter of what people are allowed to read, which is traditionally the hallmark of repressive regimes.

Booksellers that sell on Amazon say the retailer has no coherent philosophy about what it decides to prohibit, and seems largely guided by public complaints. Over the last 18 months, it has dropped books by Nazis, the Nation of Islam and the American neo-Nazis David Duke and George Lincoln Rockwell. But it has also allowed many equally offensive books to continue to be sold.

An Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement on Tuesday that the platform provides ""customers with access to a variety of viewpoints"" and noted that ""all retailers make decisions about what selection they choose to offer.""",The retailer is trying to do two contradictory things: Ban hate literature but allow free speech.,2563b958-7109-5e77-83e9-6d548ca24e95,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/17/business/17meinkampf/merlin_63577067_96605298-481b-4110-a08c-3202a64c9bda-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=82d991123466b992487848e59cf0d7692b0d73f72db75600c89c0769cf3e1a44&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""Mein Kampf"" was first banned by Amazon and then reinstated.",2563b958-7109-5e77-83e9-6d548ca24e95,N24News/imgs/2563b958-7109-5e77-83e9-6d548ca24e95.jpg,20
Real Estate,In Flushing: Upscale Condos and Retail,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/30/realestate/in-flushing-upscale-condos-and-retail.html,"For much of the city's Asian community, the center of New York City is not in Manhattan, but in downtown Flushing, Queens, the bustling shopping district at the end of the No. 7 subway line. Soon this crowded commercial hub will grow even busier as sales start early next month at Flushing Commons, a mixed-use development that has been in the works for a decade. The first phase of the 1.8 million-square-foot project will be finished in 2017, delivering 148 residential condos as well as office condos and retail. Eventually, the complex of more than five acres will house a total of 600 residential condos, an outdoor plaza and a new Y.M.C.A. facility. Completion is scheduled for mid-2021. Construction began last year on the site of a municipal parking deck between Union and 138th Streets and 37th and 39th Avenues, snarling traffic and isolating small businesses. Although the previously existing parking was consolidated at an undeveloped portion of the site, prices have jumped to $3 an hour from $1, vexing drivers and merchants. But supporters of the development see the arrival of the glassy contemporary complex as a welcome addition to a rapidly changing neighborhood, one that will deliver much-needed open space -- and ultimately increase parking spots to 1,600 from 1,100. ""Flushing is coming of age,"" said Michael Meyer, the president of F & T Group, which is developing the $1 billion project with the Rockefeller Group and Aecom Capital.

Flushing Commons will certainly alter the character of an area full of mom-and-pop shops selling pork buns, noodle soups and herbal remedies. Prices start at $650,000 for a one-bedroom with Swedish oak floors, quartz countertops and Italian porcelain tiles. Among the amenities for condo residents: a dog park, a reading room and Zen walking gardens. Two-bedrooms start at $850,000, three-bedrooms at $1.2 million and four-bedrooms at $2.5 million. The project is being marketed to Chinese buyers, particularly new arrivals. The glossy residential brochure, translated into Chinese, highlights the area's rich Asian culture, describing a place ""where deep-rooted traditions and the authentic foods and flavors of your homeland blend seamlessly with a multigenerational community."" ""Somebody that's moving from China, they're not going to want to live in the West Village and eat at the Spotted Pig,"" said Helen Lee, an executive vice president of F & T Group, referring to the popular Manhattan restaurant. ""It makes no sense. They don't speak English."" But the merchants toiling in the mostly Korean-owned shops along Union Street see Flushing Commons as a threat to their livelihoods. Foot traffic has dwindled since construction began, according to Ikhwan Rim, the president of the Union Street Small Business Association, which represents about 150 businesses. Shopkeepers also worry that once the project is complete, customers will favor the upscale Flushing Commons shops and restaurants over the older businesses nearby. Turnover has spiked since construction began, with about a third of the 150 businesses along Union Street replaced by new ones, said Mr. Rim, who owns Rim's Fine Jewelry on Union Street. ""We're sitting ducks just waiting for businesses to close down,"" he said. ""Your neighbors are one by one leaving and it's not a good sight.""

Merchants also worry that the higher parking fees have cost them the customers who plan to buy only inexpensive items like pastries or dumplings. But the lot is now privately owned and rates were set according to an agreement between the developer and the city. According to Mr. Meyer of the F & T Group, they are below current market rate. To alleviate the strain of years of construction, the city provided local businesses with $2.25 million for marketing and other support. And the Department of Transportation has taken steps to ease traffic congestion in a transit hub that includes a subway station, a Long Island Rail Road station and 22 bus routes. ""The impact is there, so then the question becomes: How do we try to minimize that or bring the community together to take on the challenge?"" said Christopher Kui, the executive director of Asian-Americans for Equality, which is managing the city funds for the businesses and has also provided about $1.5 million in microloans to 32 local businesses. The temporary inconvenience, said Peter Koo, who represents Flushing on the New York City Council, is a worthwhile price to pay for the addition of more housing, a new Y.M.C.A. and a 1.5-acre plaza to the neighborhood. ""This is an exciting development in our area,"" he said. ""It will create a lot of jobs and a lot of tax revenue for the city.""",Sales begin soon at a mixed-use complex that will add 600 condos to the neighborhood.,4049334b-4606-58cf-9e26-3979309b2529,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/30/realestate/30FLUSHING/30FLUSHING-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=e67382bbed843ff9e09b1ca85dd57ffa416ad7d8406f9870da2aa43ed9fd3f6b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A rendering of Flushing Commons, a five-acre mixed-use development planned for downtown Flushing, Queens.",4049334b-4606-58cf-9e26-3979309b2529,N24News/imgs/4049334b-4606-58cf-9e26-3979309b2529.jpg,7
Technology,"Lyft's Losses Continue, but Company Says They Will Abate",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/technology/lyft-earnings-revenue.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Lyft had warned this year that it would lose record amounts of money as it expanded its business.

But on Wednesday, the ride-hailing company walked that prediction back.

With its number of ride-hailing passengers growing and its trip commissions also increasing, Lyft said its revenue for the year would be better than it had expected, rising to a range of $3.47 billion to $3.5 billion. That growth would also help crimp its losses, Lyft said, with its expected adjusted losses totaling around $875 million for the year instead of a previous projection of $1.17 billion.

""We anticipate 2019 losses to be better than previously expected, and we are pleased to have updated our outlook,"" Logan Green, a co-founder and the chief executive of Lyft, said in a statement.

Yet the improved prospects do not mean that Lyft was close to making a profit. It lost $644.2 million in the second quarter, Lyft said, far more than the $178.9 million it lost a year earlier. A large chunk of that loss -- about $296.6 million -- was due to expenses related to the stock compensation that Lyft pays its employees. Revenue rose 72 percent from a year earlier, to $867.3 million.","With its number of ride-hailing passengers and trip fees growing, Lyft said its losses would not be as bad as it previously thought.",977518e4-2212-57d4-9acb-3c658bb39629,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/07/business/07lyft/merlin_139785927_bccbc302-6279-48fe-99f6-48efe27ff411-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=147e99d07cc92baad60e0e36f569d59e936e50b70adf41928e613174a6aeb7cf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The improved prospects do not mean that Lyft was close to making a profit.

Science,The Science of Exploding Lava,https://www.nytimes.com/video/science/100000006275847/the-science-of-exploding-lava.html,"[explosion] If that seems like a volcano, well, you're almost right. It's an experimental re-creation of what happens sometimes when cold water meets hot lava in a real volcano. Researchers at the  created this explosion, and lots of others, and they did it to study one of the dangers of volcanic eruption. They did the experiments out in the country about 40 miles south of Buffalo. The first step was to make homemade magma, and they did that by heating chunks of basalt. That's essentially ancient magma now found in quarries. The rock they used was formed in volcanoes 70 million years ago. They heated the basalt for four hours. They brought it to a temperature of 2,400 degrees -- that would melt many metals like silver and gold and do unimaginable damage to human skin, if, somehow it spilled. For that reason, the researchers suited up with protective gear, as you can see. They poured the homemade lava into a container fitted with heat-resistant steel tubes. Those tubes would allow the researchers to inject water into the molten rock. They did that remotely for obvious reasons. Sometimes, the water set off an explosion. But sometimes, they needed a swinging sledgehammer to trigger the lava bomb. The combination of homemade explosions and sophisticated video analysis turns out to be a good method for studying this process. Oh, and they recorded some really great explosions. Next up, more research using the same method because there's no question about the value of knowing more about lava bombs. And it's a lot safer to study a barrel of homemade magma than to get near a live volcano.",Scientists from the University at Buffalo study the explosive reaction between water and lava.,0d039d-f342-5568-b9d0-582cf0d5beb4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/09/science/08SCI-TAKE-promo/explosion-side-facebookJumbo.jpg?video-overlay?video-overlay,University at Buffalo,0d039d-f342-5568-b9d0-582cf0d5beb4,N24News/imgs/0d039d-f342-5568-b9d0-582cf0d5beb4.jpg,2
Science,Hoping Llamas Will Become Coronavirus Heroes,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/science/llama-coronavirus-antibodies.html,"Winter is a 4-year-old chocolate-colored llama with spindly legs, ever-so-slightly askew ears and envy-inducing eyelashes. Some scientists hope she might be an important figure in the fight against the novel coronavirus.

She is not a superpowered camelid. Winter was simply the lucky llama chosen by researchers in Belgium, where she lives, to participate in a series of virus studies involving both SARS and MERS. Finding that her antibodies staved off those infections, the scientists posited that those same antibodies could also neutralize the new virus that causes Covid-19. They were right, and published their results Tuesday in the journal Cell.

Scientists have long turned to llamas for antibody research. In the last decade, for example, scientists have used llamas' antibodies in H.I.V. and influenza research, finding promising therapies for both viruses.

Humans produce only one kind of antibody, made of two types of protein chains -- heavy and light -- that together form a Y shape. Heavy-chain proteins span the entire Y, while light-chain proteins touch only the Y's arms. Llamas, on the other hand, produce two types of antibodies. One of those antibodies is similar in size and constitution to human antibodies. But the other is much smaller; it's only about 25 percent the size of human antibodies. The llama's antibody still forms a Y, but its arms are much shorter because it doesn't have any light-chain proteins.","Antibodies from Winter, a 4-year-old llama with great eyelashes, have neutralized coronavirus and other infections in lab experiments.",262e3b8e-ffd4-5b94-97f0-1731687bb37e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/06/science/06VIRUS-LLAMAS1/06VIRUS-LLAMAS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=534d19cb26e3c837dcb1a11ca3629c915cba9798bc23a460c6432320d9fb257b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Winter, center, a llama on a farm run by Ghent University in Belgium.",262e3b8e-ffd4-5b94-97f0-1731687bb37e,N24News/imgs/262e3b8e-ffd4-5b94-97f0-1731687bb37e.jpg,2
Style,The Art of the Pitch in the Midst of a Pandemic,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/style/publicists-marketing-coronavirus.html,"The Art of the Pitch in the Midst of a Pandemic

LOS ANGELES -- Millions of people had started to shelter in place. The global economy was cratering. Coronavirus-panicked shoppers were clawing at each other over toilet paper. But apocalypse be darned. Ashley McCormick, a fashion publicist at Ragdoll PR in Los Angeles, had a product to promote. ""Forget everything you've ever heard about latex,"" her March 19 email to lifestyle journalists began. She was not referring to gloves. ""Latex has become an inescapable fashion sensation, with designers creating unique and innovative looks for both on and off the runway,"" Ms. McCormick wrote, citing Bella Hadid and Kim Kardashian West as celebrity devotees. ""But jumping straight into a full latex look may seem intimidating. So why not test the waters first with sexy & seductive latex lingerie? Our luxury lingerie line, Anya Lust, is the perfect place to find all your latex lingerie needs."" At first glance, Ms. McCormick's note, forwarded to me by a nonplused recipient, came across as offensively extraterrestrial. What planet was this person living on? Then I felt an emotion approaching compassion: She was just doing her job.

The undergarment makers of the world have payroll to make too. So do boutique public relations agencies. Fashion magazines have pages to fill; online influencers have beauty trends to discover. Just how do you go about promoting nonessential products (celebrities, linoleum, jewelry, $230 latex thongs) at a time of death counts and soaring unemployment and improvised hospitals? A single ill-considered post on social media could result in tar and feathers -- both for companies and for brand-name people, as David Geffen discovered with his Instagram salutation from self-isolation in the fancy-pants Grenadines. Even Wonder Woman got it wrong: Gal Gadot's now-infamous coronavirus video, which found her and a flock of celebrity chums warbling ""Imagine,"" will likely haunt her (and us) forever. There wasn't a single publicist around to body-block that thing? ""How brands appear to the world during this pandemic could impact how people see them for years to come, good and bad,"" said Lauren Reed, the founder of Reed Public Relations, a firm in Nashville with dining, tourism and fitness clients, among others. As the pandemic began to escalate in mid-March, Ms. Reed started a free hotline for small businesses looking for communications advice. Callers have included a cosmetic surgery center and a furniture maker.

""We're finding that a lot of people are totally lost,"" she said. Howard Bragman, the Hollywood publicist and crisis communications expert, warned that ham-handed efforts to tie products to the pandemic could do as much brand damage as charging forward as if the world had not changed at all. ""We're all getting these marketing messages in our feeds that feel really gross -- trying to sell us things we don't need by slapping on an 'in these difficult times' at the start of the pitch,"" Mr. Bragman said by phone. ""I understand that people are worried about their businesses, and rightly so. It's awful. But my personal belief is this: It's OK to say nothing for a while.""

Ms. McCormick was far from alone in pushing ahead with her promotional duties. A few hours after her pitch went out into the world, American-Brazilian Body Waxing, a Miami salon, sent a jolly email to clients to unveil a new social media account. (""Follow us on Instagram!"") A socially conscious fashion company, Able, publicized a sale on earrings and apparel -- a way to ""keep things classy"" while social distancing. (Worried about looking good on Zoom work meetings? Just remember: ""Business on top, comfort on the bottom."") Krista Ritterhoff, a publicist at Bullfrog + Baum, a New York agency, emailed a reporter she did not know -- twice -- in hopes of generating attention for Singapore as a ""Westworld"" shooting location. ""Hope all is well!"" her March 20 note started.

Clint Morris, who runs October Coast Publicity in Burbank, Calif., got in touch with me to offer an interview with an actress. ""Please let me know if you'd like to talk to Jamie Bernadette ('I Spit on Your Grave: Deja Vu') for her new film 'Dead by Dawn,' releasing in April,"" he wrote in an email. ""Happy to coordinate!"" A little too on the nose, perhaps. Ms. Ritterhoff, the high-spirited Singapore slinger, declined to comment. Mr. Morris said: ""Like everyone else, we're a little frightened -- the pandemic, the uncertainty of the entertainment business -- but the show has to go on. People need entertainment and distraction right now, so we can help with that."" Greta Kovacs Schmid, the owner and chief executive of Ragdoll PR, responded on Ms. McCormick's behalf. ""We are doing the best we can to remain sensitive in content and approach,"" Ms. Kovacs Schmid said. ""Most of our clients are small businesses and are really struggling from the pandemic, as most companies currently are, so now more than ever is it important for us to pitch."" And the response from editors and influencers? ""We've actually seen a dramatic increase in responses to our pitching efforts,"" she said. ""We've chatted with many close editor contacts who let us know they still want us to keep pitching. They understand this is our job, and we're just trying to keep our company and our clients' companies afloat."" Some agencies, however, have taken a more cautious approach.

It Wasn't Generation Z.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/style/generation-z-name.html,"Some people at a music festival who, our respondents suggested , belong to a generation you could call ""memelords"" or ""dazers"" or ""the over anticipated cleanup crew.""



When we asked readers last week to suggest new names for the generation after millennials, we received thousands of replies, both from those we had called on (22 and under) and those we hadn't (everyone else). Hundreds wrote in only to ask why we had bothered. They argued that this was an empty exercise. Kiernan Majerus-Collins, the 22-year-old chairman of the Democratic Party in Lewiston, Me., wrote: ""Don't call us anything. The whole notion of cohesive generations is nonsense."" It was the second-most popular comment on our Facebook post. He has a point. Malcolm Harris, the author I interviewed for the original reader callout, described those jostling to coin a lasting name as hacks and salesmen. (He's 29, a year older than I am.) Mr. Harris, an editor for The New Inquiry, is more amenable in his book, ""Kids These Days: Human Capital and the Making of Millennials,"" which makes a case that these labels help explain the political, economic and social trends that shape our lives.

""I do believe that it is useful, or can be useful, clearly,"" he said. ""It can also be less than useless."" We'll get to some of the least useless suggestions below, but first here are some of the broad trends revealed by the approximately 3,000 responses submitted on Facebook, Twitter, our website and directly to my email. There was plenty of support for widely publicized names already coined for the generation born, roughly, between 1995 and 2015: Generation Z, Homeland Generation, Post-Millennials and iGeneration. A significant minority had grown comfortable with ""Generation Z,"" including Raquel Glassner, 22, of Olympia, Wash. ""I've never heard iGeneration before, but that is really horrendous,"" she said. ""Our whole generation shouldn't be branded by Apple. Gen Z is the final generation of the 1900s, and a generational title using the last letter in the alphabet seems fitting.""

The youngest respondent I tracked down was Mari Sobota, 8, a third-grader in Madison, Wis., who wrote in to say that her generation would be known for ""girl power!"" Mari, 8, could identify an obvious generational difference between her and her 12-year-old sister Cassandra, and their mother, Carousel Bayrd. ""We both like cotton candy, and my mom hates that,"" she said. The oldest respondent to give her age was 91-year-old Annette Benedict, of the Bronx. ""I figure you're not an ageist,"" she wrote, a gambit that all but ensured her inclusion. Her suggested name was The Thumbies, for the digit used to operate smartphones. ""I think that suits them,"" she said, chuckling, when I called her. A significant number rejected the age ranges we selected, especially 22-year-olds who consider themselves millennials, like Zach Witkin, of Providence, R.I., who said he could clearly recall Sept. 11, 2001, an unforgettable day for many older respondents. He was 6 then. ""Maybe we could make a firm cut-off just beyond 1995?"" he suggested. Others were glad to escape a generational label so tarnished by, yes, the media.

The most popular Facebook comment came from Alexandra Della Santina, 22, an engineer at Boeing in Philadelphia. ""I wouldn't mind being called Generation Scapegoat,"" she wrote. ""It would be kind of the tongue-in-cheek dry humor that I see in this generation. And when baby boomers and Generation X or Y or whatever decide to start using us as punching bags instead of millennials, it's gonna be much harder to whine about us if they're forced to call us The Scapegoats."" Roshan Mueller, 11, was one of many to suggest the Meme Generation. ""I think it goes with how our generation goes through life,"" he explained in a phone interview, with his mom listening in. ""We go through life fast. And just like that, memes spread fast."" We also heard from multiple people suggesting Memelords, Memennials and Generation Snap. Also, the Hopeful Generation, the Anxious Generation, Generation Fix-It and The Cleaner-Uppers. Some simply wrote ""Doomed."" The Last Generation and the Final Generation were also popular. Andrea Habiba, 15, of Houston, suggested the Sisu Generation. ""Sisu is a Finnish word that roughly translate to determination in the face of adversity, and my generation will be facing many adversity such as fixing the economy, global warming, the threat of terrorism and so on,"" she wrote. Benton Molina, 21, of Athens, Ohio, suggested we call the new youngs Spimes. The term, coined by the science fiction author Bruce Sterling, refers to an object hooked into the internet of things: aware of its environment, constantly documenting itself, its existence mirrored in the cloud.

""Post-millenials share these characteristics,"" Mr. Molina observed. ""They are central units in small, personal clusters of technological nodes (made of both people and machines) who leave a data trail throughout their entire lives."" But we had a favorite. Four separate people suggested Deltas or the Delta Generation. Kelsy Hillesheim, a 22-year-old New Yorker, provided the most thoughtful explanation. ""Delta is used to denote change and uncertainty in mathematics and the sciences, and my generation was shaped by change and uncertainty,"" she explained, mentioning terror attacks, wars, the Great Recession and the 2016 election. ""I do not have much memory of a sustained time of stability, and I'm on the older end of what you're looking for, though I imagine this is also the case for younger deltas."" ""We take nothing for granted,"" she continued. ""We were kids when our parents lost their jobs in the recession. We also are a generation of demographic shift -- we are more diverse than any in American history. We generally see it as something to embrace, and welcome changes that could make for a more inclusive and just America."" Delta also implies members of this generation will be agents of change, not just people reacting to it, she said. ""We are not passive products of circumstance, but active members of society with agency to affect the course of history, and will to build each other up to make things better,"" she added. ""We know all too well that adults aren't doing so today.""",Thousands of people 22 and under (and many older people) weighed in on the most important question of the coming century.,0b86d8da-f102-595c-bc34-5608d5b65793,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/01/us/01xp-genz/01xp-genz-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=cb53e9cb3d3779487adc320b065fc22bb47a029f70a387fdf910da0832ace147&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Some people at a music festival who, <a href=""https://twitter.com/Jonesieman/status/958416564239392770"">our respondents suggested</a>, belong to a generation you could call &ldquo;memelords&rdquo; or &ldquo;dazers&rdquo; or &ldquo;the over anticipated cleanup crew.&rdquo;",0b86d8da-f102-595c-bc34-5608d5b65793,N24News/imgs/0b86d8da-f102-595c-bc34-5608d5b65793.jpg,15
Dance,A Choreographer and Her Girls Retell a Tragedy Through Dance,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/22/arts/dance/tiffany-rae-birmingham-church-bombing.html,"For the choreographer Tiffany Rae, dance is a language, deeper and more articulate than words. ""I'm better at showing you with dance what I need to say than actually talking,"" she said in a recent interview. ""You will understand how I'm feeling."" Part of what drives Ms. Rae -- apart from her innate love of dance -- is exploring issues rooted in social justice and Black culture. Dance is a way to demonstrate both artistry and activism, and last summer she did both during a protest at Borough Hall in Brooklyn, where she chose dancing over speaking and, to her surprise, the crowd paid attention. ""Everyone sat down,"" she said. ""We didn't even have to ask. It was just so amazing -- thousands of people sitting down so everyone could see."" At that protest, Ms. Rae, 24, presented a version of ""Underground,"" which examines the trauma that comes from fighting for racial equality and the continuous cycle of pain in Black communities. She said, ""The power we had in our hands, in our faces -- it gave a sort of stillness for everybody to be like, OK, this is the time to focus, this is the time to listen.""

Gillian Walsh, a contemporary dance artist who interviewed Ms. Rae for Movement Research's online publication, Critical Correspondence, wrote that to ""see this dance happen unexpectedly, so seamlessly in between people giving speeches and marching really set me on fire."" Ms. Rae, who grew up mainly in Brooklyn, has also been creating videos on Instagram and YouTube, some political and others for fun, like ""The Parkers,"" her jubilant homage to the television series. Intended as a Thanksgiving gift for her followers, it went viral; Missy Elliott, whose music is featured, reposted it.

Her most recent Rae Beast production, ""Unearth Birmingham,"" is more urgent: a response to the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church by members of the Ku Klux Klan. Four young girls were killed and many others injured. Ms. Rae's film, shot at Gymnopedie, the basement of Bushwick United Methodist Church in Brooklyn, brings the girls' perspectives to life through an inventive, vibrant tapestry of dance -- brimming with hip-hop, modern, jazz and moments of improvisation -- and music, starting with Cheryl Lynn's ""Got to Be Real"" and ending with Whitney Houston's ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody."" Naomi Southwell, 14, who portrays Cynthia Wesley, one of the girls who died, didn't know about the Birmingham bombing before she started the project. Ms. Rae had the girls watch Spike Lee's documentary ""4 Little Girls"" (1997), but her own narrative is more impressionistic than linear.

""She wanted to show people the story through our movement,"" said Ms. Southwell, a freshman at Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts. ""She wanted us to express how we might have felt if we were those four little girls, if we were in their shoes."" Toward the end, the four girls find themselves in a place they haven't been before: a gymnasium. Scared and confused, they stand close as more young dancers enter, some dressed as schoolgirls (from the studio Dancers Dreamzzz, where Ms. Rae teaches), while others are cheerleaders with the Brooklyn Diamonds (of which Ms. Rae was once a member). ""The other girls come around us,"" Ms. Southwell said, ""trying to comfort us and show us that we were going to be OK."" And then they all dance, layering forms that reflect Ms. Rae's eclectic background. She has trained in many genres, including ballet, jazz, modern, West African, Horton and hip-hop. She can move large groups, thanks to cheerleading.

And, there's something else, too: She was the only female player on the football team in middle school. (For a while, she was a cheerleader and football player at the same time.) ""I feel like the football helped me to be a power dancer,"" she said, ""To dance soft and subtle, but still have that power behind it."" Her first time performing in a music video was Beyonce's ""Let's Move Your Body."" She was in elementary school. ""Instead of mostly paying attention to the dancing, I was paying attention to what they were doing,"" she said. ""I would watch the choreographer.""

Now young girls are watching her. In a recent interview Ms. Rae spoke about the Birmingham bombing, why it was important to show the innocence of her cast and how, in the end, joy wins. What follows are edited excerpts from that conversation. When did you first learn about the bombing and how did it affect you? When I was little, I actually played one of the girls in a play. It always resonated in my heart and I wanted to do something on my own. This moment triggered so much. After that bombing, there were riots -- the same thing that's going on today. Even then, people who were racist, they realized, Oh my God, these are four innocent children. I feel that sparked the turn a little bit.

I love the way your video skips back and forth between sorrow and exuberant dancing. I want you to know that these girls are alive. Not to make it so sad, but to show the brightness at the end of that tunnel. I wanted to show that these are young girls; they're having fun. Like they could have had this, but it was taken away. I wanted to keep snatching at feelings.

It made me think about studies that talk about how Black girls are perceived as being less innocent and more adultlike than other girls their age. Was that also part of it? Yes, yes! That's so important. That's why I made them so fun. And they did that naturally themselves -- these kids are really fun and energetic, and they're really girly girls. And innocent. How did you develop the choreography? I had to make sure I knew each individual girl -- her character. I don't like to force choreography. I don't need to do a thousand steps, but I want to do choreography, not just for the dancer's eye but for regular, everyday people so they can feel what she's feeling. Sometimes you don't need to do everything so technical because the message won't come across. So I knew I just had to be each girl. I'm like, all right -- we need to have a turn here, or she needs to jump here. Or this needs to be a kick. OK: What do I feel?

Sometimes I have to just sit back and not be the dancer for a while and just be a regular person. That's why sometimes it's good for me to be on the train and just listen to the music and just be like, OK, if I was not a dancer and I was watching a show, what do I want to see? What do I want to feel? And how can that movement relate to what I could bring across? I think that was how I was able to create that choreography. How did you come up with the group dance in the gym? I knew I wanted something simple, but something loving. Something that would be easy, but subtle. We don't need to be sad forever. We need to grow and to move forward. They're looking down on us and they're shining. And it's like, we're dancing. That's the point I'm trying to make. Dance is everything.","Tiffany Rae explores the Birmingham church bombing of 1963, in which four Black girls were killed, in a new dance video.",9f68a171-56a5-5416-b931-e2131f0c8567,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/22/arts/22tiffany-1-promo/22tiffany-1-promo-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg,"A still from Tiffany Rae's ""Unearth Birmingham"" with, from left, Naomi Southwell, Sanaa Boshé, Kimora St. John, Madisen Edwards and Nahja Callis.",9f68a171-56a5-5416-b931-e2131f0c8567,N24News/imgs/9f68a171-56a5-5416-b931-e2131f0c8567.jpg,6
Health,Setting the Body's 'Serial Killers' Loose on Cancer,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/health/cancer-cell-therapy-immune-system.html,"Credit...Jesse Dittmar for The New York Times





The son of Orthodox Jews who immigrated from Poland to New York and ran luncheonettes, Steven Rosenberg was about 6 years old when his family learned that many relatives, including six of his father's nine siblings, had been murdered in the Holocaust. ""I saw so much evil in the world that early on I decided I wanted to do something that would help people, not hurt people,"" he said in an interview here. He received a medical degree from Johns Hopkins and a doctorate in biophysics from Harvard. From the start, he was a workaholic. At one point he tried to call off his relationship with Alice O'Connell, whom he would later marry, because he was afraid it would distract him from research. ""I loved the night,"" Dr. Rosenberg wrote in his book, ""The Transformed Cell,"" published in 1992. ""I remember the exhilaration of working through the night in the lab, drinking thick pasty coffee that had been on the burner for hours, walking out into the sunrise."" He added: ""To be alone and out on the edge like that, there was no feeling like it in the world."" When Dr. Rosenberg arrived at the National Cancer Institute in 1974, his first attempt at immunotherapy was to give patients T-cells harvested from pigs. That failed. He then began giving patients interleukin-2, or IL-2, a protein made by the body that spurs T-cells to proliferate. In some cases he treated patients with their own white blood cells that had been incubated in IL-2. The treatments sometimes set off such a violent immune system reaction that patients had to be placed in intensive care. From 1980 to 1984, he treated 66 patients without success. Then, in late 1984, he encountered patient No. 67, Linda Taylor, a Navy officer with melanoma whose personnel file carried the stamp ""death imminent.""

The Navy was not Carl June's desired career choice. Accepted at Stanford in 1971, he instead chose the Naval Academy to avoid the draft and Vietnam. The Navy sent him to medical school and for training in bone-marrow transplantation, geared toward treating people irradiated by nuclear weapons. When the Cold War ended, the Navy lost interest. Dr. June turned to working with T-cells at the Naval Medical Research Institute in the mid-1980s. He and a colleague, Dr. Bruce Levine, found a way to multiply T-cells in huge numbers outside the body, a method still used today. And in the mid-1990s, working with Cell Genesys, a gene therapy company, Dr. June began trying to genetically modify patients' T-cells to kill H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. But when his wife, Cindy, the mother of the couple's three children, developed ovarian cancer in 1996, Dr. June's research turned personal. Dr. June had tried everything to save her, including the primitive immune therapies under development. But Ms. June died in 2001. ""A lot of other scientists would have been disillusioned by the failure, in his case the personal tragedy,"" said Sean Parker, the internet billionaire who is funding some of Dr. June's work. Instead, Dr. June, who had moved to the University of Pennsylvania, stopped treating patients, and devoted himself to creating cell therapies for cancer. ""Things that were back burner on cell therapy became front burner,"" he said. In the 1980s, scientists began experimenting with gene therapy, putting new genes into cells of the body to treat disease. Michel Sadelain, while still a graduate student studying immunology at the University of Alberta, told colleagues that he thought the technique could be used to supercharge T-cells to fight cancer.

The new claws came from another part of the immune system known as antibodies. Drug companies already knew how to make antibodies with claws that bind to specific proteins in the body. But the claw was not enough. Once a claw binds to a target protein, it needs a molecule to signal the T-cell to go into killing mode. Yet another signal helps sustain the killing. The DNA instructions for all three components are inserted into the patient's T-cells. Since this concoction is part antibody and part T-cell, it is a chimera, like the monster of Greek mythology that is part lion, part goat and part serpent. The claw is called a receptor and the protein it binds to on the cancer cell, the target, is called an antigen. So the whole construct is called a chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, and the use of it to treat cancer is called CAR T-cell therapy, or CAR-T. Dr. Sadelain was not alone in this work. Zelig Eshhar, an Israeli scientist, is credited with developing one of the first crude CARs around 1989. Dr. Rosenberg, always on the lookout for new types of immunotherapy, invited Dr. Eshhar to be a visiting scientist in his laboratory at the National Cancer Institute. Another early developer was Dr. Dario Campana of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. As scientists worked to perfect the formula in the 1990s and early 2000s, there was quite a bit of sharing. Cancer cell therapy was still mostly an academic exercise; it was highly uncertain whether it would ever really work. Dr. June, after hearing a presentation by Dr. Campana at a conference in 2003, requested a sample of Dr. Campana's CAR. Dr. Sadelain shared his design with both Dr. June and Dr. Rosenberg. The most prominent CAR developed at the National Cancer Institute owes a lot to Dr. Sadelain, Dr. Rosenberg said. But the science proved difficult and the research money scarce. Pharmaceutical companies showed little interest, preferring mass-produced drugs, one size fits all, rather than a treatment that would be made separately for each patient.

Bill Ludwig, a retired captain in the New Jersey Department of Corrections, had already paid for his funeral when he started treatment in August 2010. Once his genetically engineered T-cells were unleashed in his system, Mr. Ludwig's lungs started to fail, his legs ballooned to twice their size, his blood pressure dropped and he began hallucinating. When he emerged from the ordeal, doctors searched for cancer. Detecting none, they ordered another test, certain of error. But there was no mistake. Five pounds of tumor had been destroyed. Mr. Ludwig, now 71, and his wife bought an R.V. ""We're trying to make up for lost time,"" he said. He has celebrated the high school graduations of five grandchildren and welcomed his first great-grandchild. As for Dr. June, Mr. Ludwig said: ""It's hard to describe someone who basically saved your life. He lost the one he loved, and turned around and saved me years later."" The 2011 publication of Dr. June's results transformed the field. Novartis, the big Swiss pharmaceutical company, licensed the rights to the therapies created in Dr. June's lab at the University of Pennsylvania, throwing aside concerns that treatments manufactured for individual patients would not be good business. That set off a commercial rush, flooding the field with cash after years of doubt. While various companies are in pursuit, three are in the lead. They hope to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration to bring the first CAR treatments to market as early as 2017 or 2018, although it is not yet clear how easy it will be to get regulatory approval for such a novel therapy. The companies are teamed with academic pioneers: Novartis with Penn; Kite Pharma with the National Cancer Institute; and Juno Therapeutics with Sloan Kettering, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and Seattle Children's Hospital.

Patrick M. Coughlin, who teaches anatomy at the Commonwealth Medical College in Scranton, Pa., now explains the immune system to his classes by telling how one man overcame cancer. Only gradually does it become clear that he is referring to himself. Now 63, Mr. Coughlin noticed a mass the size of a softball in his abdomen in summer 2013. It was a form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Three different types of chemotherapy and a bone-marrow transplant all failed to help him. Desperate, he came to the National Institutes of Health campus here last year for the cell therapy developed by Dr. Rosenberg's team. The battle between Mr. Coughlin's genetically engineered immune cells and the cancer was brutal. For four days he had a fever as high as 105, chills and bed-soaking sweats. Even his brain malfunctioned -- at one point he could not count to 10 or write his wife's name. But when the battle ended, the cancer was no longer there. ""If I had gotten this thing five years ago,"" he said of his disease, ""I'd be dead."" Yet for all the excitement, there are reasons for caution. The CAR therapy works now only for patients with some B-cell lymphomas and leukemias, which account for only about 80,000 of the 1.7 million cases of cancer diagnosed in the United States each year. It has not been successfully used to treat malignancies of the lungs, breast, prostate, colon or other organs. ""The solid tumors that kill over 90 percent of people do not respond to anything we have now,"" Dr. Rosenberg said. Because it is personalized, cell therapy is likely to be frightfully expensive -- probably hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient, though the companies bringing these treatments to market have not yet said how much they would charge.

Producing the re-engineered cells is lengthy and complex. Some patients have died during the two to four weeks it took to genetically modify and multiply their cells. And the therapy itself can be arduous. First, patients get chemotherapy to wipe out many of their existing T-cells to make room for the engineered ones. Once those enter the body, they can set off a ferocious immune response as well as temporary neurological problems like memory loss, seizures and hallucinations. Recently Juno Therapeutics had to temporarily halt its clinical trial after three patients died from brain swelling. The problem arose when the company added a second chemotherapy drug to the regimen preparing the patients for the cell infusion. The authorities allowed the trial to resume without that chemotherapy drug. Still, some patients find themselves hoping they get violently ill, since that is a sign the treatment is working. ""Every morning my wife would ask me how I'm feeling,"" said Myles Stiefvater, a copier salesman from Newark, Del., who had the treatment in 2014. When he said he felt O.K., they were disappointed. Researchers are also finding, to their dismay, that remissions do not always last. The therapy has had its biggest success in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, producing complete remissions for 60 percent to more than 90 percent of patients. Yet up to half of those patients eventually suffer a relapse. In some cases, the tumor evolves so that it no longer displays on its surface what the claw binds to, making it invisible to the engineered cells. In other cases, the engineered cells might not last long enough in the body, giving the cancer a chance to resurge.

""T-cells are very powerful,"" said Dr. Campana, formerly of St. Jude and now at the National University of Singapore. ""In the same way they can eliminate cancer, they can also kill you."" A protein called HER2, for instance, is found on many breast and other tumors, making it a seemingly good target. But it is also found in tiny amounts in the lungs. When Dr. Rosenberg's team infused killer T-cells aimed at HER2 into a patient, she went into respiratory distress within 15 minutes and died five days later. The treatments work for the blood cancers because there is a good target. But finding these for the most common cancers has been difficult. One problem is that CARs, because of how they are made, can bind only to proteins on the surface of cancer cells. But most proteins made by these cells, or by any cell for that matter, are inside the cell, out of reach. There is an alternative approach that is gaining interest. Patients' immune cells can be engineered to make what are called T-cell receptors, or TCRs. These can recognize proteins inside the cancer cells. Some experts say TCRs, which have a far wider array of potential targets, represent the best hope of using cell therapy to treat solid tumors. There have been hints of effectiveness already in treating one of those, a type of sarcoma. It might turn out that the best target for each patient will be unique to that person. Scientists are now experimenting with using DNA sequencing and other techniques to find the best mutated protein in each person's tumor at which to aim the claw.

In the last two years he has visited more than 150 cities in more than 20 countries. This year alone he has accumulated more than 200,000 airline miles. Despite that schedule, he runs ultramarathons and participated in July in the Death Ride, a grueling bicycle race in California. Dr. Rosenberg still arrives at the National Cancer Institute nearly seven days a week. The walls outside his office are covered with signed photographs of the hundreds of fellows who have trained under him, many of them now leaders in immunotherapy. Every five years, they gather for a reunion, to reminisce and honor their mentor. Arie Belldegrun, who was a fellow in the 1980s, now runs Kite, the company commercializing the National Cancer Institute's CAR technology. He recounted what happened when he tried to get Dr. Rosenberg to join the company. ""He sits quietly, quietly, quietly, and then he asks, 'Arie, why don't you ask me what I want to do?' ""He said: 'Every day that I go to work, I'm as excited as a kid coming to a new place for the first time. If you ask me what I want to do, I want to die on this desk one day.'"" But not before he conquers cancer. ""I want to end this holocaust,"" Dr. Rosenberg said in the interview. ""I think I'm finally getting the hang of what it will take to widely apply this to cancers.""","After a long, intense pursuit, researchers are close to bringing to market a daring new treatment: cell therapy that turbocharges the immune system to fight cancer.",9dc9d7cd-cf9d-51fe-bf01-387030977635,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/01/science/01CANCER2-01/01CANCER2-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=b4b5bd0f303e746406274cd36cbc1dedeb46675c69d45ae6db07808e3b7b111b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dr. Steven A.

Health,Wikipedia and W.H.O. Join to Combat Covid-19 Misinformation,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/health/wikipedia-who-coronavirus-health.html,"As part of efforts to stop the spread of false information about the coronavirus pandemic, Wikipedia and the World Health Organization announced a collaboration on Thursday: The health agency will grant the online encyclopedia free use of its published information, graphics and videos. The collaboration is the first between Wikipedia and a health agency. ""We all consult just a few apps in our daily life, and this puts W.H.O. content right there in your language, in your town, in a way that relates to your geography,"" said Andrew Pattison, a digital content manager for the health agency who helped negotiate the contract. ""Getting good content out quickly disarms the misinformation."" Since its start in 2001, Wikipedia has become one of the world's 10 most consulted sites; it is frequently viewed for health information. The agreement puts much of the W.H.O.'s material into the Wikimedia ""commons,"" meaning it can be reproduced or retranslated anywhere, without the need to seek permission -- as long as the material is identified as coming from the W.H.O. and a link to the original is included.

""Equitable access to trusted health information is critical to keeping people safe and informed,"" said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the W.H.O.'s director general. His agency translates its work into six official languages, which do not include, for example, Hindi, Bengali, German or Portuguese, so billions of people cannot read its documents in their native or even second language. Wikipedia articles, by contrast, are translated into about 175 languages. The first W.H.O. items used under the agreement are its ""Mythbusters"" infographics, which debunk more than two dozen false notions about Covid-19. Future additions could include, for example, treatment guidelines for doctors, said Ryan Merkley, chief of staff at the Wikimedia Foundation, which produces Wikipedia. If the arrangement works out, it could be extended to counter misinformation regarding AIDS, Ebola, influenza, polio and dozens of other diseases, Mr. Merkley said, ""But this was something that just had to happen now."" Eventually, live links will be established that would, for example, update global case and death numbers on Wikipedia as soon as the W.H.O. posts them, Mr. Pattison said.

The agency maintains its own website at www.who.int and has accounts on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, Pinterest, Snapchat, YouTube and Twitch. Both men said their organizations want the world to have accurate information about the disease. Since the virus was discovered in January, Mr. Pattison has been leading the W.H.O.'s efforts to work with online platforms to fight what it called an ""infodemic"" of rumors. The health agency collaborates with panels of moderators from each website, and also teaches short courses in covering medical information to journalists from various countries, including the United States. Some rumors, like the belief that Covid-19 is caused by eating bat soup or that it can be cured by eating garlic or hot peppers, are fairly harmless or ""just silly,"" Mr. Pattison said. But others, such as claims that the illness can be fought by drinking bleach or high-proof alcohol, can be lethal. ""More than 700 people in Iran were killed by that rumor that you should drink high-grade alcohol,"" Mr. Pattison said. The debunking effort has become more difficult as unfounded rumors have been repeated by influential people. Guests on Laura Ingraham's show on Fox News have touted at least seven unproven Covid treatments, including hydroxychloroquine, antibiotics, vitamins, zinc and monoclonal antibodies targeted against other diseases.

President Trump backed hydroxychloroquine for weeks and publicly asked whether Americans should inject themselves with disinfectants or put ultraviolet lights -- which can cause burns and break human DNA, which leads to cancer -- inside their bodies. Mr. Pattison said he had a staff of only five, although the agency subscribes to NewsGuard, a service that hunts for new rumors springing up on the internet. His staff examines NewsGuard alerts, consults medical experts, posts accurate information on the W.H.O. website and then calls its contacts at social media agencies and asks them to link to it. In contrast, collaborating with Wikipedia ""is like having an army to work with,"" he said. Wikipedia has about 5,200 Covid-related articles in 174 languages, Mr. Merkley said. More than 82,000 contributors have written or edited them, including 3,000 who worked on the main article in English Wikipedia. Because some contributors insert errors or ""make malicious changes,"" he said, there are several levels of safeguards. Some pages can be ""locked"" and cannot be changed until one of more than 200 volunteer editors on WikiProject Covid-19, many of whom are doctors or academics, review it. More than 1,100 volunteers have set alerts to notify them when any page they are interested in is changed. And, if necessary, changes by any account that has existed for less than 30 days can be blocked. The W.H.O. also works with Google, but in a different way, Mr. Pattison said. For instance, Google analysts alerted his team that searches for an unfamiliar product as a Covid cure were peaking in Peru. The W.H.O. looked at the product, realized it was a type of bleach and alerted Google. ""They gave us $50 million worth of free ads on Google,"" he said. The agency posted public service announcements that read, ""Learn the truth about Covid and chlorine.""","The health agency will license much of its material to the online encyclopedia, allowing the information to be reposted widely into almost 200 languages.",e3858397-86d1-502e-9afb-9f97df1d3438,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/22/multimedia/22virus-wikipedia/22virus-wikipedia-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=3091158e0dca5f80dd30e8e0037483a0c7b5caa1b27b91f345f46f5df6cb8576&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The collaboration aims to counter misinformation regarding the coronavirus and could be extended to debunking other medical myths.,e3858397-86d1-502e-9afb-9f97df1d3438,N24News/imgs/e3858397-86d1-502e-9afb-9f97df1d3438.jpg,1

* None  

The piped-in crowd noise at this fan-free United States Open won't be anything near the shouts -- some of joy, some of fury -- generated last year by Daniil Medvedev. He antagonized the crowd in his third-round win over Feliciano Lopez, basking in boos that he encouraged during his on-court interview. Then he battled to the fifth set of the final against Rafael Nadal, and had New York in the pocket of his Lacoste shorts. For Medvedev, it was ""a great roller coaster"" that showed the different sides of his personality. ""I didn't try to, say, 'OK, sorry, guys, that was not me.' I did mistakes; I admit it. But that's me,"" Medvedev said. ""And then, finally by fighting, playing good tennis, maybe being funny, but again, not being another person, not trying to hide something, they were cheering me at the end."" With Nadal not competing in this U.S. Open, the third-seeded Medvedev stands apart as an obvious threat to return to the final, where he could face top-seeded Novak Djokovic, who has not lost a match this year. Medvedev cruised in his first round match on Tuesday, beating Federico Delbonis 6-1, 6-2, 6-4. Though there was no crowd to please, Medvedev still pulled off an impressive no-look passing shot for his own amusement. Medvedev's second round opponent will be Christopher O'Connell, who is ranked No. 116. Medvedev's run to the U.S. Open final, along with titles in two other big tournaments around that time, helped vault him into the top five in the men's ranking. His success in New York was no fluke, even though his unusual wielding of his lanky limbs can make his laser shots look lucky. ""You wouldn't say from a tennis coach's perspective that he is an ideal player for his shots, but he does everything so well,"" said Aljaz Bedene, who lost to Medvedev last week in the third round of the Western & Southern Open. ""He moves well, he serves well, he's tall. Even if his shots look odd at times, he hits everything so well."" Tennys Sandgren, a 2018 and 2020 Australian Open quarterfinalist, recalled marveling at Medvedev the first time he saw him, on a practice court in Lyon, France, three years ago. ""He was hitting them so hard and so flat,"" Sandgren said. ""I was like: 'What is this? What are these levers moving this way?'"" Medvedev's coach, Gilles Cervara, said that ""Daniil has this unusual technique because of his unusual body."" ""The technique works with his body, his biomechanics, and also his psychology and mentality,"" Cervara added. ""It's a system: All four things go into that technique."" Djokovic, who lost twice last year to Medvedev and won a bruising four-set match against him at the Australian Open, said that despite ""not the best-looking technique"" on his forehand, Medvedev's unshakable backhand makes engaging him in metronomic rallies a mistake. ""It's kind of cat-and-mouse when you play him,"" Djokovic said. ""You're really trying to change the depth and not just go kind of left-right, because he likes the rhythm."" Medvedev did not play any of the exhibition events held during the tour's five-month stoppage, but looked sharp in his three matches last week at the Western & Southern Open. He led Roberto Bautista Agut, 6-1, 4-3, before losing their quarterfinal. ""My muscles are going to learn from it,"" Medvedev said after that loss. ""They are going to remember what it is to play these tough matches."" Aside from his practices, Medvedev got his competitive kicks during the tour stoppage by playing a mobile trivia game, only ever wanting to compete against other people. He excelled, fittingly, on questions in the sports category. (He enjoyed watching hockey, snooker and other sports with his father when he was a child.) On the court, Medvedev can generate showstopping speed, even catching opponents off-guard when they think the point has been won. ""We've seen highlights where players stopped playing and he still got there and won the point,"" Bedene said of Medvedev. ""It's amazing. Besides having a strong serve, his movement is above any others."" Medvedev said it was too bad fans would not be able to react to his game in person in New York because he thought he had done enough to win them over. ""Of course, it's going to be really sad without the New York crowd,"" Medvedev said of playing this year. ""Because I think at the end of what happened that this year they would be a lot for me, I hope.""","Daniil Medvedev, who took Rafael Nadal to five sets in the men's singles final last year, is among the favorites to get there again.",47a42882-6a4f-54b1-b8ca-0ce661b3731f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/01/sports/01usopen-medvedev01/01usopen-medvedev01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=1699aa361c2b94aeadc1c8f53408d2f6fb78334b4878a068b81ba41af132e6d6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Daniil Medvedev is seeded third in the men's singles draw of the United States Open.,47a42882-6a4f-54b1-b8ca-0ce661b3731f,N24News/imgs/47a42882-6a4f-54b1-b8ca-0ce661b3731f.jpg,9
Food,"Eyal Shani, an Israeli Celebrity Chef, Makes His New York Debut",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/08/dining/eyal-shani-miznon-restaurant-nyc.html,"Whole roasted cauliflower as interpreted by Eyal Shani, an Israeli celebrity chef, is about to make its debut in New York. The chef's signature dish will be on the menu at a branch of Miznon, his global group of casual counter-service restaurants, opening at Chelsea Market in a couple of weeks.

The burnished head of cauliflower, first boiled in salt water that's ""always moving, like the sea,"" as the chef put it, then gently massaged with olive oil and roasted, becomes a meltingly tender, pull-apart dish. Mr. Shani claims to have been the first to create it after noting a roasted head of cauliflower at the home of Shahar Segal, a filmmaker and advertising executive who is his partner at Miznon.

Whether or not he was first, whole cauliflower and cauliflower steaks have become popular around the world. And to hear this 59-year-old chef with impressively sculpted hair tell it, the cauliflower is only one of his achievements, including, as he claims, inventing ""the first carpaccio in the world made from fish."" He also boasts about his tomato sashimi. ""The world started copying me, and nobody gave me credit,"" he said.

A self-taught chef who started his career in Jerusalem in 1989 with the high-end seafood restaurant Ocean, Mr. Shani became known for his bouillabaisse. ""It was the best bouillabaisse because it was straight out of Julia Child's book,"" he said.","Mr. Shani's whole roasted cauliflower will be on offer at a branch of Miznon, his global group of casual restaurants, when it opens at Chelsea Market this month.",80d778b0-dbde-5aec-9904-2bb82f357b3e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/10/dining/10israeli1/10israeli1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=be19008e932cee2bdcf7070cd0684ae8ab277b5a1c7447623f725fe1a83e5c05&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Israeli celebrity chef Eyal Shani is bringing his signature whole roasted cauliflower to Chelsea Market in a couple of weeks.,80d778b0-dbde-5aec-9904-2bb82f357b3e,N24News/imgs/80d778b0-dbde-5aec-9904-2bb82f357b3e.jpg,17
Science,Lanternflies Eat Everything in Sight. The U.S. Is Looking Delicious.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/science/lanternflies-pennsylvania-crops.html,"Lanternflies Eat Everything in Sight. The U.S. Is Looking Delicious.

To most people, the buds and sprouts of April are welcome heralds of spring. But to some farmers and scientists in the southeastern corner of Pennsylvania, these signs mark the beginning of a long season of dread. Their worry is Lycorma delicatula, the spotted lanternfly. It is an invasive pest with a voracious appetite and remarkable reproductive talents. Native to Asia, lanternflies first appeared in Pennsylvania in 2014. Despite a quarantine effort, they have also been discovered in small numbers in New York, Delaware and Virginia. In their native range, lanternflies feed primarily on one type of tree -- Ailanthus, the tree of heaven. The trees are an invasive species, too, common across the continental United States, and so entomologists fear lanternflies one day may spread to far-flung corners of the country.

A nationwide outbreak would be something of a disaster, some scientists believe. Among the lanternfly's more alarming qualities is an ability to feed on a huge range of plants, including many of commercial value. Lanternflies are believed to use at least forty species of native plants in the United States as hosts. They are particularly fond of grapevines, apple and stone fruit trees as well as a number of hardwood trees, like black walnut and maple. ""We've seen it in hops, we've seen it in some of the grain crops that are out there, soybean and what have you,"" said Fred R. Strathmeyer Jr., Pennsylvania's deputy secretary of agriculture. ""It's able to feed on many, many different things."" While it is too soon to gauge how much damage lanternflies might cause in the long-term, they can easily decimate certain crops in a single season. ""They've been appearing in grapes, and we have reports from growers last year of a 90 percent loss,"" said Julie Urban, a senior research associate at Penn State.

Then there is the lanternfly's unusual ability to lay eggs on almost any surface. While other species tend to deposit eggs on a living plant or in soil nearby, lanternflies can place a bundle of eggs nearly anywhere -- wheel wells, train cars, shipping containers. Agricultural inspectors in Pennsylvania have even started checking beehives for lanternfly eggs. ""Most pests deposit their eggs on their host plant, or very close, so they already have food available,"" said Surendra Dara, an adviser at the University of California Cooperative Extension. ""Those that have the advantage of being able to lay eggs on non-plant material obviously have a better chance of surviving and spreading,"" he added. To try to contain lanternflies, regulators have set up a quarantine zone in Pennsylvania that now spans over 3,000 square miles (up from 174 in 2016) and includes 13 counties, as well as Philadelphia. The state prohibits the moving of certain items within the zone, including firewood, outdoor furniture and construction debris. Officials also have launched a permit program for companies shipping goods out of the area. ""It's not just an agriculture problem, this is truly an across-the-board commerce problem, because we are trying not to move it,"" said Mr. Strathmeyer. ""This is everyday people, this is the trucking company, the U.P.S. driver, the delivery guy."" In February, the federal Agriculture Department stepped in as well, setting aside $17.5 million in emergency funding to finance research and help the quarantine effort.

Many scientists who have studied lanternflies fear that the pace at which populations have grown so far suggests an uphill battle ahead. ""It's unbelievably eruptive in terms of its population,"" said Michael Saunders, a professor emeritus of entomology at Penn State. ""The very first year we went out, in 2015, you had to really hunt for egg masses, and then over the next two years it was just spectacularly exponential in its growth."" ""I've been through a few waves of invasive species, and this is far and away the most incredible thing I've ever seen,"" he said. South Korea is the only other country in which the spotted lanternfly is an introduced pest. It was first observed in 2004, and its impact on agriculture there has become a cautionary tale. ""It spread across the whole country in three years,"" said Dr. Urban. ""It's still a problem there."" Like aphids, lanternflies feed on plant sap and excrete most of the carbohydrates they consume in the form of honeydew -- a sticky, syrupy liquid. The honeydew promotes the growth of mold, which can ruin produce and cover leaves, blocking out sunlight and killing plants. In residential areas, honeydew can coat yards and porches, and its sugary consistency attracts gnats, bees and other unwanted insects. ""I've actually seen stalagmites of hardened honeydew on the ground,"" said Dr. Saunders. ""If you're an entomologist, it's spectacular, but if you're a homeowner and you have these in your yard, it's a nightmare.""

Lanternflies have mostly been contained in Pennsylvania so far, so some experts hope that they may still be eradicated through traditional means. A variety of insecticides are being tested. In March, lawmakers in Maryland even tabled a bill to ban chlorpyrifos, a pesticide deemed unsafe by the Environmental Protection Agency some years ago, in anticipation of needing it to combat lanternflies in coming months. Researchers have also begun studying the insect's natural predators in Asia, with an eye to possibly releasing them in the United States. Several species of parasitic wasps are under consideration as a method of biological control, though this strategy typically only becomes practical once an invasive species becomes established. ""Biocontrol is an option that you would take up after eradication has been ruled out,"" said Kim Hoelmer, a research entomologist at the Agriculture Department. Scientists are pondering more experimental solutions as well. A team of researchers at the University of Kentucky is exploring using RNA interference, or RNAi, to develop a novel insecticide. The technology works by silencing the expression of genes that are critical for vital functions like movement, but are also unique to a given species of insect. Last year, the E.P.A. approved the first RNAi-based insecticides for use against another pest, corn rootworm. ""RNAi is one of the ways to control insects in a target-specific manner with precision, without harming the environment,"" said Subba Reddy Palli, a professor of entomology at the University of Kentucky.

While RNAi has proved ineffective against other types of insects, notably many species of butterflies and moths, early indications are that the spotted lanternfly may be susceptible. With more sophisticated solutions still years away, however, many of those working to halt the advance of lanternflies in the field are staying focused on the present. If trends continue, this season is expected to be an important predictor of how severe the problem could become. ""2018 is going to be a critical year for us to know whether we'll be able to really effectively contain, suppress and ultimately eradicate this pest or not,"" said Osama El-Lissy, a deputy administrator of plant protection and quarantine at the Agriculture Department.","The invasive insects turned up in Pennsylvania in 2014.

Music,R. Kelly Is Set to Face Trial in Chicago in September,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/22/arts/music/r-kelly-trial-chicago.html,"A date was set on Tuesday for the singer R. Kelly's federal trial in Chicago on child pornography and obstruction charges, but even the judge said the date was ""not set in stone"" given the pandemic-related delays that continue to bog down the court.

Judge Harry Leinenweber of U.S. District Court set Kelly's trial for Sept. 13, five months after another federal trial Kelly faces in New York.

Prosecutors in the Northern District of Illinois told Leinenweber they would need three weeks to present evidence against Kelly, who is facing charges that he and two former employees conspired to fix his 2008 state trial in Cook County on child pornography charges by paying off witnesses and victims to get them to change their stories.

Mr. Kelly is also scheduled to face trial on April 7 in New York on racketeering charges. In that case, an indictment filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn alleges that Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, and his associates ran a criminal enterprise that recruited women and underage girls for illegal sexual contact and then isolated and threatened them to keep them under control and prevent them from going to the authorities.",A judge acknowledged that the date for the singer's federal trial on child pornography and obstruction charges could change because of pandemic-related delays.,ccb21c23-3551-5a82-b108-67eabdc708fd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/22/arts/22rkelly-item-2/merlin_170039889_65169358-6dab-422d-9e91-4287b61356e9-facebookJumbo.jpg,R.

Travel,Three Strategies for Finding Snow,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/travel/ski-resort-snow-conditions.html,"Planning a ski vacation well in advance is a tricky proposition. Early birds can't possibly know what snow conditions will be several months or weeks out. And those who wait for flakes to fall risk missing out on special deals -- if there is any availability left at all late in the booking game.

One strategy for early bookers is to consider where the snow has fallen most in the past. The highest snowfall averages over the course of more than 10 years include at Jay Peak in New England, Alta and Snowbird in Utah, and Revelstoke in British Columbia, according to Joel Gratz, the founder of Opensnow.com, which offers snow reports and forecasts by a group of powder-hungry meteorologists. ""However, every season is different,"" he points out. ""And most often, snow forecasts for an entire season are not reliable, so we can't necessarily use the past as a perfect guide to the future.""

Case in point. If you avoided Colorado this holiday season because of dismal early conditions last year, you sorely missed out. Plentiful snow allowed ski resorts to open early with more terrain than usual. Aspen Snowmass had already received more than 130 inches by the end of December, with more than 5,300 acres of terrain open for skiing, compared with 1,900 the previous year. Vail Mountain's Back Bowls opened just after Thanksgiving, marking the third time in the last decade that the backside of the mountain has opened so early, and all the resort's 5,289 skiable acres were open before the New Year. Breckenridge, which reported more than 172 inches by early January, had opened all five of its peaks by Dec. 12 -- the earliest all five were open in the resort's history .

Scientists say climate change will make the booking equation all the more complicated as temperatures continue to rise. The Climate Impact Lab, a group of climate scientists, economists and data analysts from the Rhodium Group, the University of Chicago, Rutgers University and the University of California, Berkeley, released an analysis last year projecting that if trends continue, some popular ski resorts could lose as much as a month of the season within the next two decades.","How do you plan a ski trip to ensure the best conditions? You can think about a resort's track record, or which have the best snow-making machines. Or you can gamble.",191e298f-ef7b-56e1-a10c-08ded44087d7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/10/travel/03update-snowfall2/03update-snowfall2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=09dc36e99fa8b9a05d76497de98d57109f2bbcc6b9d5eb789e629911027fb845&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Jackson Hole Mountain Resort in Wyoming has nearly tripled its snowmaking volume in five years.,191e298f-ef7b-56e1-a10c-08ded44087d7,N24News/imgs/191e298f-ef7b-56e1-a10c-08ded44087d7.jpg,4
Opinion,John Bolton Gets the Last Laugh,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/opinion/john-bolton-book.html,"President Trump's reaction to the leak of incriminating details in John Bolton's forthcoming book shocked me. Not the part where the president said that Bolton was making up a Ukraine quid pro quo in the service of the best-seller list -- that he was lying for lucre. Trump sees that transaction everywhere he looks, because he sees it first and foremost in the mirror. No, I was surprised that the president didn't dispute knowing Bolton, or at least didn't say that he was so slightly acquainted with his own former national security adviser that he couldn't pick him -- chinchilla-bushy mustache and all -- out of a lineup. That's Trump's favorite ploy. Ask Michael Cohen, Anthony Scaramucci, Prince Andrew, Stormy Daniels, Gordon Sondland, Lev Parnas. Fall into disrepute, cross Trump or claim to have the goods on him and you're wiped clean from his memory, no matter the existence of contradictory forensics. Ivanka, beware. You're one bad manicure away from paternal amnesia. Bolton is the impeachment star of the week, whether he winds up testifying or not, and I can't shake the feeling that he plotted all of this out: keeping his head down during the hearings in the House; letting it be known only afterward that he'd be willing to testify in the Senate; the revelation this week -- simultaneous with assertions by Trump's defense team that there were no firsthand witnesses to the president's wrongdoing -- that his book indeed addresses Ukraine and fully backs up the charges in the articles of impeachment.

When Trump came down that escalator in June 2015, the laws of political gravity were suspended, and Bolton's emergence as a darling of Democrats is the latest example. He was so far to the right and such a ferocious hawk that President George W. Bush bypassed the Senate to sneak him in as ambassador to the United Nations. He later feathered a nest at Fox News, also known as the Trump administration applicant pool. And at a time when most self-respecting foreign-policy mavens had concluded that Trump was toxic, Bolton opened his lips wide to the poison, signing on to become the president's third national security adviser. Of course, the president is now on his fourth. Trump can't dismiss Bolton's account of events as partisan. Bolton's conservative credentials prove otherwise. Trump can't bellow ""deep state,"" not when he handpicked Bolton at a stage of his presidency when he'd already become sensitive to that supposedly pernicious force. All Trump can do is command his Republican minions in the Senate to fall in line. Sadly, most of them will. Don't be impressed by the possibility that now -- and, I stress, only now -- some Senate Republicans may press for witnesses, including Bolton, in the trial. This isn't a stirring of conscience. It's a cloaking of humiliation. If they ignore Bolton, their still-unshaken commitment to acquitting Trump becomes even more naked.

Besides, hearing from witnesses wouldn't erase Republican senators' awful behavior to this point in the trial: all the ugly gloating from the likes of Lindsey Graham that Adam Schiff's undeniable eloquence was for naught; Marsha Blackburn's pathologically exuberant attacks on the integrity of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman; Martha McSally's disgraceful sniping at a perfectly polite television reporter (""liberal hack,"" she spewed) and then her cynical use of that Trumpian outburst to raise money for her re-election campaign. This is sycophancy at its most shameful. Scratch that superlative: I was forgetting Mike Pompeo. According to The Times's scoop about Bolton's book, he writes that Pompeo, too, was aware of the Ukraine pressure campaign -- the same Pompeo who did nothing to stop the vilification of Marie Yovanovitch; the same Pompeo who promoted the debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election; the same Pompeo who once warned that Trump would be ""an authoritarian president who ignored our Constitution"" and then, when Trump gave him a really neat job, decided that a little authoritarianism never hurt anyone. Of late he seems to be having a meltdown. I attribute it to his realization that his reputation and belief in his own rectitude won't survive Trump. He's assessing the bargain he made and understanding how completely his ambition eclipsed his integrity. It's hell when you're revealed to yourself. Bolton, meanwhile, is probably feeling pretty content. He knows how badly the Trump presidency will be judged and has positioned himself on the right side of history -- this time around. Maybe bitterness brought him here, maybe ego, maybe this quaint old thing called patriotism. He survived Trump. I'd read that book. I invite you to sign up for my free weekly email newsletter.

Well,Late to Launch: The Post-Collegiate Struggle,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/well/family/late-to-launch-the-post-collegiate-struggle.html,"When Hayley Hanway graduated from the University of Michigan in 2013, she expected to quickly land a job in her desired field of ecosystem management. She had a respectable grade point average as an environmental science major from one of the nation's top-rated public schools. She had participated in a climate science program at Oxford University in England and spent a summer working for an environmental conservation program in New Zealand. But after a fruitless five-month job search, she took a 20-hour-a-week position as a fragrance assistant at Macy's, making minimum wage. She moved into her parents' basement in Marshall, Mich. In April, 2014, she finally secured a job in her field as a lead horticulturist at a zoo. The job provided benefits, but paid only $12 an hour -- still not enough for her to have her own place.

It used to be that students looked upon college graduation with excitement -- the beginning of a road full of promise and, ultimately, an exciting new career. But for many college graduates these days, it's quite the opposite. Despite a national unemployment rate of 3.7 percent, about the lowest it's been in 50 years, many young adults lack job prospects that mesh with their idealized vision of the post-college world. In 2018, 23 percent of those ages 25 to 29 were living in their parents' home, up from 17 percent in 2007, according to the National Center for Family and Marriage Research at Bowling Green State University. Crippling student loan debt often forces young people to move back home. According to the Pew Research Center, 53 percent of those with a bachelor's degree or higher have student loans and a quarter of those with debt owed $43,000 or more. A 2015 study by Jennifer Copp, an assistant professor at Florida State University, found that returning to a parent's home was associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms among young adults experiencing employment problems. Maria Kefalas, a professor at St. Joseph's University who was part of the MacArthur Foundation's Research Network on the Transition to Adulthood, said moving back home creates a domino effect. ""If you can't afford your own place, you limit your job search to the opportunities in driving distance of your family home."" Courtship becomes challenging when you live in your parents' basement, she said. Dr. Kefalas has observed an increase in the number of recent college graduates who are having difficulty transitioning into the post-college world. She said some students are not using college effectively; many show up in the career office for the first time in their senior year, without immersing themselves in experiences throughout their college years that prepare them for the job market.

A 2017 survey by Strada Education Network and Gallup of 32,000 students at 43 four-year institutions found that the vast majority of students feel unprepared to get a job after graduation; only a third of students believe they will graduate with the skills they need to succeed in the workplace, while just half believe their major will lead to a good job. Diane Hudson, director of the Certified Professional Career Coach Program, a certification of the Professional Association of Resume Writers & Career Coaches, said recent graduates today often lack the interpersonal skills needed to land a job. Reliance on social media and limited experience with face-to-face interaction means they no longer know ""how to properly shake a hand or look somebody in the eye. They have to learn social skills later."" Natascha F. Saunders, a career coach specializing in teens and adults who is based in Boston, said over-involved parents can hamper a job search. She recalls one parent who showed up with her child at a job interview. Ms. Saunders insisted she wait in the lobby, but the parent approached her daughter right afterward and wanted to know exactly what happened: what was said, what questions were asked and how she responded to those questions. Ms. Saunders said she has also seen parents attend career networking events geared to students and alumni. ""The parents mean well,"" she said. ""They want the best for their child, but their actions aren't helpful."" Maureen Tillman, a clinical social worker in Maplewood, N.J. who started College With Confidence & Beyond, a professional practice to help young adults become emotionally and financially independent after graduation, says many recent college graduates do not have resiliency skills ""as a result of being bubble-wrapped in high school and college"" by parents who want to protect them. Resilience is key in a stressful job market. Even though the unemployment rate for bachelor's degree recipients ages 20 to 29 is at 8.3 percent, the lowest it's been since 2007, Dr. Kefalas has seen ""disturbing trends in underemployment and stagnating wages."" The salaries her students earn after college aren't much higher than they were a decade ago. Competition for jobs can be fierce. On average, 250 people will apply for a job through a campus recruiting event. ""Hundreds of students are vying for one entry-level role. Employers are demanding more of the potential applicants. It's tough to get that particular job,"" Ms. Saunders said.

Ms. Hanway can attest to that situation. Looking to better her credentials and increase her job prospects, she received a master's degree in environmental management at Duke University in May. ""I needed my bachelor's to get a job and my master's to get a job I could actually live on,"" she said. She applied for 40 jobs -- she was one of 150 applicants for one she didn't get -- but secured only four interviews. It doesn't help that many college graduates have set the bar high. Since childhood, many have internalized the self-esteem building message that they can do anything and should not settle. ""With that comes anxiety around whether they're doing enough or whether a job is good enough,"" said Kit Yarrow, a professor emeritus of psychology at Golden Gate University in San Francisco. Jeffrey Arnett, a professor of psychology at Clark University in Worcester, Mass., and author of ""Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road from the Late Teens Through the Twenties,"" observes that ""young people today have this universal aspiration to find a job that's more than just a way to make a living that is different than previous generations."" They're seeking a position that reflects their identity and aligns with their values, he said. But ""employers don't create jobs to fulfill a person's identity. They just need someone to do the job, so there's often a mismatch."" Ms. Hanway only applied for jobs that she felt would make a positive impact on the world. ""It limits your pool and they're lower paying, but it's still more moral than making a ton of money on Wall Street,"" she said.

Young adults who are struggling aren't helped by the barrage of heavily curated social media posts that make it seem as if so many peers are succeeding, said Dr. Brian Primack, director of the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Research on Media, Technology and Health. He said nearly all young people use social media, and a study he published in 2017 showed those who use it often were the most lonely. A young adult who is in a more vulnerable state because of financial issues, a bad breakup or another kind of loss has a ""skewed perspective that is more likely to affect their sense of connectedness"" and potentially result in depression, anxiety and other problematic outcomes, he said. The takeaway of a vulnerable person scrolling through social media is often, ""I'm not having as happy and successful a life as all these people,"" he said. Despite the gloomy statistics, Dr. Arnett said he was heartened by findings in the Clark University Poll of Emerging Adults, a national survey he directs of 1,000 young adults ages 18 to 29, in which 89 percent said they were confident that they would eventually get what they wanted out of life. Dr. Kefalas agrees that it's not so much a failure to launch among young people today; it's a delayed launch. Life is looking less bleak these days for Ms. Hanway, now 28. In September, she finally got her dream job, as a science writer at her alma mater. She's now earning a salary of $52,000 plus full benefits. The day before her job started, she finally moved out of her parents' basement into a one-bedroom apartment. ""It was a lot of work, but I did finally get there,"" she said.","Despite a low unemployment rate, many young adults lack job prospects that mesh with their idealized vision of the post-college world.",46aa2ebf-5d0b-5f41-a93d-26499f88bd99,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/30/well/00WELL-YOUNGADULTS/00WELL-YOUNGADULTS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=0ef2e8251399d1eb63d0e5cb4b6361e416c8c3789230881d4288e02fe2f05fb5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Maureen Tillman, a clinical social worker in Maplewood, N.J., whose practice aims to help young adults become independent, says many were ""bubble-wrapped in high school and college.""",46aa2ebf-5d0b-5f41-a93d-26499f88bd99,N24News/imgs/46aa2ebf-5d0b-5f41-a93d-26499f88bd99.jpg,18
Fashion & Style,Kendall and Kylie Jenner Party for Their Fashion Brand,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/11/fashion/kendall-and-kylie-jenner-kanye-west-party-fashion.html,"When young designers want to unveil their first collection, they may hold a fashion show, perhaps during fashion week. But not if you're Kendall and Kylie Jenner.

On Monday night, three days before the official start of New York Fashion Week, the sisters introduced their new line, Kendall & Kylie, with an ""intimate house party"" in a penthouse duplex in TriBeCa.

First to arrive were the clothes, which were displayed on racks in the corner as if in a boutique. There were bondage-y heels inspired by Manolo Blahnik, gingham high-rise trousers that went around the knee, and crisscross mesh dresses that called to mind Givenchy and Helmut Lang.

Cindi Leive, editor in chief of Glamour, and Anne Fulenwider of Marie Claire arrived shortly after 8, just as a publicist approached the press line and made it clear that topics like the sisters' romantic life, their transgender parent and a certain in-law's struggles with drugs were off limits.","The sisters unveil their line, Kendall & Kylie, at a house party in TriBeCa, with appearances by Kanye West and ASAP Rocky.",1d50dc0d-4155-56fd-add1-5c92c7c2a923,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/11/fashion/11JENNER/11JENNER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=e3e2c4f0d70362ae9530ea4190e9c212b053e6e8cc4f9b21b7d45d61f45b7dd6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Kendall Jenner, Kanye West, Kris Jenner, Kylie Jenner, Ian Connor and ASAP Rocky at the unveiling of the new line Kendall & Kylie.",1d50dc0d-4155-56fd-add1-5c92c7c2a923,N24News/imgs/1d50dc0d-4155-56fd-add1-5c92c7c2a923.jpg,19
Dance,Swans With Glittering Technique,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/28/arts/dance/swan-lake-city-ballet.html,"Megan Fairchild has been a principal dancer at New York City Ballet since 2005. Tiler Peck advanced to that rank in 2009. Yet it was not until this week that these ballerinas got their first chance to star in ""Swan Lake."" That's not so strange. The City Ballet repertory is centered on the 20th-century masterpieces of George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins and is continually supplemented by the new works that the company produces at a rate surpassed by no other troupe. Ms. Fairchild and Ms. Peck, both virtuosos, have thrived in this home territory -- Ms. Fairchild distinguished by her comedic gift, Ms. Peck by her astonishing command of musical timing. ""Swan Lake,"" a 19th-century classic, is outside of that realm and neither Ms. Fairchild nor Ms. Peck is an obvious choice for the double-role lead. To play Odette, whom an evil sorcerer has turned into a swan, and her doppelganger Odile, who deceives the prince into betraying Odette, you need to be a highly dramatic dancer -- like Sara Mearns, who has dominated the role at City Ballet for years and who danced her passionate, complex interpretation on opening night last week.

Still, challenging ballerinas is a City Ballet tradition and a good one. And so at the David H. Koch Theater on Tuesday, Ms. Fairchild debuted in Peter Martins's 1996 version of ""Swan Lake."" Ms. Peck followed on Wednesday. They both did well, though neither has yet fully discovered how to make the role her own or how to make it heartbreaking.

Ms. Fairchild was most interesting as Odette. Especially at first, she seemed like a small-boned bird with a fast-beating heart. In her initial meeting with Prince Siegfried (Gonzalo Garcia), she kept giving slow double takes, as if to ask, ""Who is this guy? And what does he want from me?"" This was dramatically convincing.

When the tempo picked up, her quick pointe work was particularly brilliant, and in the crucial slow sections, her dancing had feathered softness. But it was never plush. It lacked the grandeur to match Tchaikovsky's music, and offered nothing in compensation. As Odile, Ms. Fairchild showed some slither and hints of bad-girl satisfaction. But this performance was too tame, too contained. The confidence and daring that have recently loosened up her dancing weren't yet evident. The role's technical challenges seemed not to bother her, though even this proficiency was dramatically flattening. There was not enough danger in her Odile to make her thrilling, just as there was not enough vulnerability in her Odette to make her tragic.

The idea that technical excellence might prove insufficient -- and possibly an impediment -- was raised in more extreme form by Ms. Peck's performance. Moment to moment, she looked every inch the traditional Swan Queen: the rippling shoulders and arms, the long lines, the picture-perfect positions. Some moments went beyond that, as when the force of her dancing made it seem that she might fly away. Ms. Peck's Odile was diamond-sharp. She used her mastery of timing to wow her Siegfried (Chase Finlay) with stop-on-a-dime phrasing. And the famous feat of fouette turns by the dozen gave her even less trouble than they had Ms. Fairchild. Ms. Peck mixed in extra revolutions.

Right after she passed that test, her face broke into a real smile. It illuminated the pleasure and freedom that had been missing before. With her extraordinary prowess, Ms. Peck can afford to be more reckless, to enjoy herself more. Her entire performance was studded with glimmers of fresh thought, down to her final exit as Odette, with part of her clinging to Siegfried as the rest of her reverts into swandom. But it was all too calculated to live as drama. It should be said that Ms. Fairchild and Ms. Peck did not have much help. Their Prince Siegfrieds, also making debuts, were competent, gallant, bland and less than believable. And this production, with its often-bemoaned flaws (the design) and irksome elements (the jester), is pushed off balance by the ingenuity of Mr. Martins's choreography, which displays the company's adroitness at the expense of the central drama. It takes a comet like Ms. Mearns (who dances the role again on Saturday night) to burn through its coldness. Ms. Fairchild and Ms. Peck aren't like that, but maybe they can find another way. They both get a second chance this weekend.","Megan Fairchild and Tiler Peck, making their Odette-Odile debuts, are still figuring out how to make ""Swan Lake"" full-blooded drama.",abd11f54-ac90-5ee0-b78c-7dc0e669cc3b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/29/arts/29SWAN1/29SWAN1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=84a01de4ba3aad03115a00ef93e6e0468180da44fc3feaf85534e2aaa6d02799&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Megan Fairchild made her Odette-Odile debut on Tuesday night.,abd11f54-ac90-5ee0-b78c-7dc0e669cc3b,N24News/imgs/abd11f54-ac90-5ee0-b78c-7dc0e669cc3b.jpg,6
Sports,"Johnny Majors, 85, Winning Coach at Pittsburgh and Tennessee, Dies",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/sports/ncaafootball/johnny-majors-dead.html,"Johnny Majors, a homegrown college football hero in Tennessee who coached Pittsburgh to an undefeated season and a national championship before returning to his native state to forge a successful 16-year head-coaching career at the University of Tennessee -- although one that ended in bitterness -- died on Wednesday at his home in Knoxville, Tenn. He was 85. The University of Pittsburgh announced his death. No cause was given. The even-tempered Majors was a college head coach for 29 years: five at Iowa State (1968-72), four at Pittsburgh (1973-76), 16 at Tennessee (1977-92) and four more back at Pittsburgh (1993-96). His overall record was 185-137-10. Majors's coaching years at Tennessee, in Knoxville, where he had been an All-America tailback, brought three Southeastern Conference championships and 12 postseason bowl trips. But just before the 1992 season, he underwent quintuple heart bypass surgery, and his offensive coordinator, Phillip Fulmer, was named interim coach while Majors recovered. Fulmer won the first three games of the season. Majors then returned and lost three of his first five games. Some people felt Majors had returned too quickly, some felt his football philosophy was too conservative, and some felt Fulmer was maneuvering to get the job full time.

University officials decided to replace Majors with Fulmer, offering Majors a job as assistant athletic director. He declined, and negotiated a buyout of more than $500,000 (about $910,000 today) with two years left on his contract. (Fulmer held the head coaching job until 2008, when he, too, was forced out. He is now Tennessee's athletic director.) ""The University of Tennessee jerked the rug out from under me,"" Majors said at the time. ""I have a lot of anger and a feeling of betrayal."" As the newspaper The Tennessean said: ""It broke his heart. It also stung his professional pride.""

John Terrill Majors was born on May 21, 1935, in Lynchburg, Tenn., to Shirley and Elizabeth Majors. His father was a well-known high school football coach who became head coach at the University of the South, in Sewanee, Tenn. As a freshman, Johnny was a T-formation quarterback for a hapless Lynchburg High School team. ""We won one game,"" he recalled. ""We lost the first three by scores of something like 58-0, 55-0 and 65-7.""

That one win came against a team his father coached at Huntland High School, and the loss rankled the elder Majors, who vowed that it would be the ""last dad-blamed time a son of mine plays against me,"" as Johnny Majors recalled in a memoir, ""You Can Go Home"" (1986, with Ben Byrd). Shirley Majors then moved the family to Huntland, about 20 miles to the south, where Johnny finished out his high school career playing for his father's squad. (Three of his brothers also played for their father.) Jackie Sherrill, who was an assistant under Majors at Iowa and Pittsburgh and succeeded him as Pitt's head coach, said in an interview on Wednesday that Majors's father had been a major influence on his son's coaching career. ""He was exposed to what a football coach was, and what it took to be a football coach and a successful coach,"" said Sherrill, who added that he spoke to Majors on Sunday night. ""And he was certainly exposed to how to treat players."" At Tennessee, Majors had an All-America career as a 5-foot-10, 165-pound tailback who did much more than run. He variously passed, punted, called signals and played safety in a 6-2-2-1 defense. (His brother Bobby also achieved All-America honors playing for Tennessee.) In 1956, Johnny Majors's senior year, Tennessee was 10-0 in the regular season and ranked second nationally to Oklahoma before being upset by Baylor in the Sugar Bowl. In the voting for the Heisman Trophy as the nation's outstanding player, Majors finished second to Paul Hornung, the Notre Dame quarterback and future N.F.L. Hall of Fame running back for the Green Bay Packers. In 2012, Tennessee retired Majors's No. 45 jersey. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1987. His death came two days after that of another former Southeastern Conference head coach, Pat Dye, of Auburn, a fellow Hall of Fame inductee.

Considered too small to play in the National Football League, Majors was not selected in the draft. Instead, he spent 11 years as an assistant coach -- three seasons at Tennessee, four at Mississippi State and four at Arkansas -- before becoming head coach at Iowa State. In his next job, at Pittsburgh, he inherited a team with 11 consecutive losing seasons and only one victory the year before. He quickly brought in 83 recruits, and his first team there went 6-5-1. Three years later, in 1976, with the Heisman Trophy winner Tony Dorsett at tailback, Pittsburgh went 11-0 in the regular season, defeated Georgia in the Sugar Bowl and was voted national champion. Majors was voted coach of the year in 1973 and 1976. Pitt has not won a national championship since then. After his ill-fated tenure at Tennessee, Majors returned to Pittsburgh to take on another rebuilding job. This time the magic was gone. After the second game of his first season, a 63-21 loss to Virginia Tech, he walked into the media interview room and asked, ""Do you have any questions?"" When no one spoke up immediately, he asked, ""Do you have any answers?"" In his second stint at Pittsburgh, his teams finished 3-8, 3-8, 2-9 and 4-7. In his final season, Pittsburgh lost to Ohio State by 72-0, Miami by 45-0, Syracuse by 55-7 and Notre Dame by 60-6. Majors resigned after that. ""I'd like to coach probably until I couldn't walk,"" he said on stepping down, ""if I had enough good teams."" Majors and his wife of 61 years, Mary Lynn Majors, had a son, John, and a daughter, Mary, who also survive him. (Tessa Majors, an 18-year-old Barnard College student whose murder in Manhattan in December gained wide attention, was a great-niece.) Complete information on survivors was not immediately available. ""He spent his last hours doing something he dearly loved: looking out over his cherished Tennessee River,"" Majors's wife told Sports Radio WMNL in Knoxville on Wednesday. Majors received an unusual honor from a young actor (and former high school and college football player), who considered him his childhood hero. As a tribute, Harvey Lee Yeary, who would become the star of the television shows ""The Six-Million Dollar Man"" and ""The Fall Guy,"" adopted the stage name Lee Majors.","A former star for Tennessee, he led Pitt to a national championship and coached the Volunteers for 16 seasons, only to be ousted after heart surgery.",9dd9faca-58c4-51fa-8c72-fe905b4589f3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/04/obituaries/03Majors1/03Majors1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=d018189647e9b1210e0c321fad830f67291fb5f67bef5b7ca1fff7ecb26e6bd9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Johnny Majors in 1990 with his University of Tennessee players.

Theater,5 Must-See Shows if You're in New York This Month,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/theater/5-must-see-shows-if-youre-in-new-york-this-month.html,"It's beginning to look a lot like summer. So go out and play, already, or better yet, go see a play. Those two pieces of advice are not mutually exclusive this month, which offers a happy assortment of open-air fare, a creepy comedy for those in the mood to be properly scared and -- for the nonpassive theatergoer with itchy feet -- the chance to get lost in site-specific wonderlands.

Does that title send a voyeuristic tingle up your spine, or perhaps the uneasy sensation that you're being watched by someone unknown? You can probably assume that both responses are appropriate to this ambiguously but evocatively titled new immersive theater piece, which takes place during World War II and is staged in a former meat market on 14th Street beneath the High Line. Its creators include Randy Weiner, a producer of that long-lived prototype of macabre, site-specific revelry, ""Sleep No More""; the choreographer Ryan Heffington; and the designer Desi Santiago. Brace yourself for what are being advertised as ""intimate encounters"" with the performers. Another auspicious offering -- and more close encounters -- for those not averse to taking a (highly) active role in their entertainment. This show takes its audiences into the wings, bowels and byways of the Claire Tow Theater at Lincoln Center to explore the mysteries that lurk backstage and the phantasmal presences that materialize when a playhouse goes dark. This journey into the night comes from the wonderfully inventive Brooklyn-based Third Rail Projects, which sent theatergoers down the rabbit hole with its hit site-specific production ""Then She Fell,"" inspired by the fantastical travels of Lewis Carroll's Alice, and into a hedonistic, out-of-time resort with ""The Grand Paradise."" Wear your walking -- or even dancing -- shoes.

This one is a sinister comedy for those who prefer to be weirded-out at the theater by more traditional means. Written by Clare Lizzimore, best known as an adventurous director in her native Britain, ""Animal"" charts the disintegration of Rachel, a successful woman who would appear to have every reason to be contented with her life. So why does she suspect that there's something unspeakable living in the walls of her house? Whatever's behind Rachel's malaise, you can expect its symptoms to be vividly brought to life by Rebecca Hall, who has shown her willingness to cross all sorts of emotional lines onstage (""Machinal"") and onscreen (""Christine""). Rachel's husband is portrayed by Ms. Hall's real-life, very talented spouse, Morgan Spector. This Atlantic Theater Company production is directed by Gaye Taylor Upchurch, who did a swell job with Simon Stephens's ""Harper Regan.""

There's nothing like watching a little bloody political carnage beneath an open sky. This year's season of Shakespeare in the Park opens with a new production by the Public Theater's artistic director, Oskar Eustis, in which he gives a contemporary gloss to Shakespeare's tragedy of honor, ambition and assassination in a seething Rome where no one is to be trusted, especially if you're an overweening head of state. The talent-packed cast includes Gregg Henry in the title role, Corey Stoll as Brutus, John Douglas Thompson as Cassius and Nikki M. James as Portia. As for Antony, the charismatic orator who can whip a crowd into a revolutionary frenzy, that role will be filled -- no doubt to repletion -- by the charismatic Elizabeth Marvel (the wily president on ""Homeland"").

Another option for those who like their theater al fresco is this one-man show, previously staged at the Old Vic Theater in London, in which Darrow -- the mythic American lawyer celebrated for his role in the Scopes trial, in which he fought for the right to teach evolution in public schools -- dispenses wit and wisdom, while snapping his suspenders. This is to take place, if you please, at the Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing Meadows, Queens. Really? A lone actor is going to hold court, as it were, in a stadium designed for epic tennis matches? Since the actor is Kevin Spacey, who never met a stage he couldn't fill, the prospect seems entirely feasible. Thea Sharrock directs David Rintels's play in a two-night-only performance (June 15 and 16).",June brings a comedy for those who prefer to be weirded-out; a show for theatergoers with itchy feet; and Kevin Spacey in the role of Clarence Darrow.,692e30d1-41cc-5a7b-9162-98c740c8b5f9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/01/theater/01mustsee-caesar/01mustsee-caesar-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=a573fc40a9a980a525cb4294c56cab19a7126ef179b1ca02c0fcdbbeb44f23af&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Gregg Henry in the title role of ""Julius Caesar"" at the Delacorte Theater.",692e30d1-41cc-5a7b-9162-98c740c8b5f9,N24News/imgs/692e30d1-41cc-5a7b-9162-98c740c8b5f9.jpg,10
Music,"24 Years Later, Roberto Alagna Steps Back Into 'Bohème' at the Met",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/arts/music/roberto-alagna-boheme-met-opera.html,"Roberto Alagna on the set of ""La Boheme"" at the Metropolitan Opera, where he sings the role of Rodolfo through Jan. 25.



A skeletal set had been constructed deep within the Metropolitan Opera earlier this week for a rehearsal of Puccini's ""La Boheme,"" and the antics of the opening act ensued in a rough approximation of a garret apartment in 19th-century Paris. Then came the most famous knock on a door in all of opera, as Mimi, the fragile, doomed seamstress, arrived to ask the poet Rodolfo to light her candle. In the company's classic Franco Zeffirelli production, after Rodolfo calls out to ask who's at the door and a woman's voice answers, he rushes over to a mirror to neaten his hair. It's a charmingly corny moment that rarely fails to earn a chuckle from the audience.

Over the past two decades, Mr. Alagna, now 56, has barely touched this opera as he moved from his breathlessly hyped early years to a more under-the-radar mature stardom. Opera careers beat ceaselessly forward, and his repertory has shifted toward heavier roles like Radames in ""Aida,"" Calaf in ""Turandot,"" the leads in the verismo double bill known as ""Cav/Pag,"" and the title role in ""Samson et Dalila,"" with which he opened the Met's 2018-19 season. (Even Wagner's Lohengrin, which he canceled in 2018 and has rescheduled for this fall.) But when Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager, offered him a return to Puccini's boyish hero, Mr. Alagna accepted. ""O.K., Peter,"" he recalls saying, ""if you want to take the risk, I'll take it, too."" ""I'm very happy they trust in me to sing it,"" Mr. Alagna added, sipping a can of Coca-Cola before the rehearsal on Monday. ""It's not easy, as you can imagine. You have to fight with the ghosts of old singers, as well as your own ghost."" These are edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Alagna, which took place in a lounge as a video monitor relayed a live feed from a stage run-through of ""La Traviata,"" starring Mr. Alagna's wife, the soprano Aleksandra Kurzak.

When is the last time you sang this opera? It's very strange to be here for ""Boheme."" Because I sang my first one 30 years ago; it was in March '90. The last time was in 2012. It was a gala for Covent Garden for the 20th anniversary of meeting Angela [Gheorghiu, the soprano who became his second wife]. But really, my last ""Boheme"" was 20 years ago. I sang many, many, many ""Bohemes"" at the beginning because it's an opera for young singers about young people -- happy and full of hope, joking about terrible things. They discover life, but also death. And this was also my case. When I was young -- I was 29 -- my first wife became ill, and she died [in 1994] when I was singing ""Boheme."" I was in the hospital and she died there, and one week later, I sang ""La Boheme"" at La Scala and everyone was in tears, I was crying, and it was impossible to sing the last ""Mimi."" Still today, after 30 years, it's terrible for me, at the end. For example, two days ago, we did the final scene and I was not able to sing the last ""Mimi."" I told it to [the conductor, Marco] Armiliato: If you can't hear the ""Mimi,"" it's because in that moment, it's too difficult for me. Your Met debut, in 1996, was another moment your real life intersected with the story, but this time more happily: Before the fifth performance, the general manager, Joseph Volpe, announced that you and Ms. Gheorghiu had been married the night before. That was a matinee, and we followed it that night with the concert for [the 25th anniversary at the Met of] Jimmy Levine. I was exhausted. But it was good; it wasn't bad performances. I think we had a wonderful success.

Expectations were high: A profile in The New York Times before your debut had the headline ""Could It Be True? A New Pavarotti?"" And the reviews were mixed. Bernard Holland's review in The Times said you were recovering from a cold and dourly predicted ""big vocal troubles five years down the road."" I was not sick; I had allergies. I was allergic to plane trees, and I was staying at the Essex House on Central Park South. In April, it was the worst, and I arrived the first night with this allergy. But I sang well. I was afraid, though, and I canceled the second performance. And I spent my entire night in my room, singing. I said, O.K., I will never cancel, it's stupid. I was able to sing. It was difficult for me: They presented me here as a star. It was maybe too much. They put my face everywhere, on the buses, everywhere. Placido Domingo went into the EMI office screaming, ""He's not the tenor of today! He's the tenor of the future. I am the tenor of today."" It was something like this. It was difficult to arrive in a new theater with such responsibility on my shoulders. How difficult has it been to transition back to Rodolfo? When you arrive in this kind of role you've sung some years ago, it's not very easy to put in the voice. We just arrived from Barcelona, singing ""Cav"" and ""Pag,"" this heavier repertoire. To return in ""Boheme"" is not easy. You have to work to make the voice smaller and higher.

But the most important is the evolution of the character. It's no more Rodolfo, the singer and poet you want to be; for me it's now a human being, it's closer to me. I understand the guy and what he can feel; everything he lives in this opera, I had in my life. Studying, being with friends, economic difficulties, a lot of problems, death. For me now, I am Rodolfo after all those experiences, with maybe a bit of [Offenbach's] Hoffmann, also. Not disappointed with life, exactly, but I understand what is important: not the glory, not the money, but to be well with yourself, with your family, to be in good health and good harmony with people, and in harmony with yourself. For many years I was very self-critical. It was difficult for me to listen to my CDs; I was sad accepting my voice, because it wasn't the sound I had in my mind. But today I am more mature, I have more serenity. I'm more relaxed, even if the challenge is big. Because, you know, I will try to sing it [Rodolfo's sweeping first-act aria, ""Che gelida manina""] in key. Everybody, after they're 40 years old, sang a half tone down -- even Pavarotti, [Jussi] Bjorling, everybody. But I will try, not because I am better than others -- but because it's for me. I want to sing clear, young, and not so large. When I was young, I had a very large breath, and I enjoyed singing long phrases; today, I try to be more maybe closer to the score, closer to the words, closer to the sentiment. I will try to be believable.","The star tenor, now 56, returns to the boyish role of his breathlessly hyped 1996 debut.",f1a91cac-3dc0-5429-a6d1-17e6d028653e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/11/arts/10ALAGNA-1-promo/10ALAGNA-1-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=db960284feba8267119bbb680fcc6e39e358f1deceb0c2ac1489d9671307c695&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Roberto Alagna on the set of ""La Bohème"" at the Metropolitan Opera, where he sings the role of Rodolfo through Jan. 25.",f1a91cac-3dc0-5429-a6d1-17e6d028653e,N24News/imgs/f1a91cac-3dc0-5429-a6d1-17e6d028653e.jpg,12
Movies,Some Movies Actually Understand Poverty in America,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/movies/hillbilly-elegy-nomadland.html,"There's a scene in Ron Howard's new ""Hillbilly Elegy"" that approaches the quiet dignity I wish the rest of the movie had. Glenn Close stands in a doorway. She's playing Mamaw, the proud Appalachian grandmother of the high schooler who will eventually write the memoir on which the film is based. Mamaw accepts a free dinner from Meals on Wheels. And while it pains her to do so, she asks for more food. The delivery kid blinks, embarrassed. But he bends the rules a little and the two connect over a small but meaningful act of charity. Depicting the complex realities of poverty -- not just its hollowed-out emptiness but attendant emotions of shame and despair -- has always been tricky. That's doubly true for those employed by Hollywood. Filmmakers in Europe and Asia have stronger track records. Italy has its earthy tradition of neorealism, bringing us midcentury heartbreakers like ""Bicycle Thieves"" and ""Umberto D."" In India, Satyajit Ray made the humane miniatures of his 1950s Apu Trilogy, set just a hair's breadth away from destitution. Socially committed voices like the British Ken Loach (""I, Daniel Blake"") and the Belgian Dardenne brothers (""Rosetta"") have each won Cannes's top prize, the Palme d'Or, twice.

To its lasting credit, Hollywood produced a mythical moment of compassion during the worst days of the Great Depression: a climactic close-up that even decades later remains nuanced and open-ended. Charlie Chaplin's ""City Lights"" (1931) is a comedy vibrating with economic anxiety. While its iconic hero's resourcefulness is never seriously in doubt, the Little Tramp looks pretty rough by film's end -- penniless, on the streets, clothes in tatters after a stretch in jail. In the final shot, though, he is seen for what he is by the one he loves; his eyes shine, knowing there can be no more hiding his true identity. Does she love him back? (By extension, do we?) The fade to black on Chaplin's quivering face is both hopeful and a touch uncertain. The critic James Agee called it the ""highest moment in movies."" But the studios, by and large, didn't follow Chaplin's lead. Ultimately, it took the schism of independent cinema, decades later, to open the door to unflinching examinations of poverty that weren't merely sentimental, reductive or convenient plot devices to be solved in the nick of time. Kelly Reichardt's ""Wendy and Lucy"" (2008) plunges us into the brutal quandaries that come with limited means: Do I buy dog food or steal it? Do I get my broken-down car serviced or make do without? Every choice knocks back Wendy, an Alaska-bound loner played by Michelle Williams, a bit, as do the rare instances when she encounters sympathy, an emotion that seems to confuse her. (The Times critic A.O. Scott celebrated the film as a piece of homegrown ""neo-neorealism."")

Like ""Wendy and Lucy,"" honest movies about subsistence living never prescribe a one-size-fits-all solution. Sometimes they're not about fixing things. Amid the squalor of Sean Baker's pastel-tinted ""The Florida Project"" (2017) and Harmony Korine's cringe-a-minute ""Gummo"" (1997), children go about the business of dreaming and playing, inventing their own escapes, not so innocently. A pre-""Hunger Games"" Jennifer Lawrence is too young to be saddled with rearing her siblings and finding her missing father but somehow that's exactly what she does in the Ozarks thriller ""Winter's Bone"" (2010) from Debra Granik.

Finding a strain of autonomy or boldness is crucial in elevating a film about poverty -- even a modestly budgeted one -- from seeming condescending. Michelle Pfeiffer carved out the performance of her career in ""Where Is Kyra?"" (2018), Andrew Dosunmu's little-seen indie masterpiece of urban isolation. It's about an unemployed, divorced Brooklyn woman falling through the cracks of the social safety net. (Kyra is on the cusp of becoming a bag lady.) Her desperation is offset by a willingness to go to scary lengths. That's because poverty itself is scary. Financial ruin serves as the subtext of so many classic American horror films, perhaps because monsters are easier to deal with than the real thing. Leatherface and his cannibal clan from ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" (1974) would have no ax to grind if they hadn't been laid off at the meatpacking plant. The hook-handed stalker of ""Candyman"" (1992) preys on the downtrodden Chicagoans of the crime-ridden Cabrini-Green housing project, at least before he begins indulging a taste for grad students obsessed with urban legends.

A science-fiction film that pays more than lip service to the plight of the poor is John Carpenter's sociopolitically inflamed ""They Live"" (1988), flatly described by the director as a reaction to Reaganomics. Its homeless hero, Nada (Roddy Piper), drifts between construction jobs before donning a pair of special sunglasses that allows him to see the alien (i.e., yuppie) invasion already at hand. According to Piper, who himself experienced homelessness before his pro wrestling career took off, Carpenter offered daily wages to vagrants appearing as extras. He fed them, too.

Partly filmed in a flimsy shantytown that the script calls Justiceville, with the luxe glass towers of downtown Los Angeles gleaming in the distance, ""They Live"" is subversive on many fronts, notably for bearing witness to sights that some civic leaders would rather erase from the cityscape. Such erasures had happened in the past: Kent MacKenzie's ""The Exiles"" (1961) captures L.A.'s Bunker Hill and its small community of working-class Native Americans, who once lived on reservations. Today, the neighborhood's Victorian buildings and their residents are long gone, paved over by corporate gentrification and racism. Like a photograph, a film crystallizes pain, traps it in time. In the case of these dramas -- along with the finest of them, Charles Burnett's ""Killer of Sheep"" (1978) -- a universality attaches itself to scenes that anyone struggling will recognize: tense conversations at the kitchen table, fury at a steady stream of disappointments, from car troubles to the sickening monotony of existence. (Burnett's beaten-down patriarch works in a slaughterhouse.) The camera watches on, a steady companion. That same documentarylike eye also grabs something serendipitous from the hazy Watts summer air: boys skipping rooftops from building to building. It's dangerous and crazy -- and also euphoric. There is freedom in their leap. The camera tilts down and we see no safety net. Burnett includes the shot for all those reasons and one more: Maybe you can fly away.","The complex realities of subsistence escape ""Hillbilly Elegy.""

Your Kitchen Can Be as Well Stocked as Restaurants Now



If Jessica Kramer didn't already know that she had started to shop in a new way, the personal letter she got from the meat and poultry supplier D'Artagnan would have been a tip-off. After thanking her for her business, the company informed her that it would be happy to send a truck to make personal deliveries to the hotel in Newport, R.I., where she and a friend have been living since March. Now, instead of having blocks of frozen meat shipped overnight, she can get freshly slaughtered Rohan duck breasts, squab and baby poussins brought to her door, along with bunches of ramps and other specialties. Ms. Kramer made a note of this in the spreadsheet where she keeps track of more than 50 high-quality food purveyors who are now selling directly to consumers, many for the first time. Some have lowered or dropped their minimum order requirements, or their delivery fees. Restaurant-supply companies that once sold fresh vegetables to chefs by the case now offer them in packages of 16, eight or four ounces. Items the local Stop & Shop rarely stocks -- wild morels, trays of sea urchin roe, pink hunks of sushi-grade tuna -- have become stars of Ms. Kramer's quarantine kitchen.

While the pandemic has changed myriad aspects of American life in ways we are still starting to see (will anyone ever go back to a desk job?), none may be as pervasive as the new ways we shop and eat. As grocery shopping became a minor tactical operation, home cooks began to think like the chef of a small restaurant that is booked every night. To stock refrigerators and cabinets with supplies for menus planned a week or more in advance, they have turned to many of the same businesses that restaurants used -- from major regional wholesalers to family farms raising asparagus and a herd of goats. Many of these suppliers slapped together their retail operations overnight in March in a desperate attempt to survive the month. Now, as summer nears, these new trade routes may be here to stay.

Restaurants in every major city now offer not just delivery and takeout -- minor lifelines for the industry -- but also boxes of the ingredients used in their kitchens, sometimes with recipes or assembly instructions included. Chefs are boxing up their hummus and selling partly-assembled meals to be finished at home -- all the supplies for beef barbacoa tacos; a clay pot of biryani sealed under a lid of dough that needs half an hour in the oven; cookies with decorating kits; meats that had been aged for expense account spenders, now for you. ""We have been talking for weeks now about how the entire business is going to change forever,"" said Marc Hennessy, the executive chef of Rare, a small steakhouse chain in Washington and Wisconsin that is now selling premium dry-aged cuts of meat butchered to order for home cooks. Retail is now about 30 percent of his business, he said, and ""we plan to keep that going."" What this all means for home cooks is access to better ingredients, sometimes at better prices, and the demystifying of restaurant dishes in ways that have made replicating them at home all the more easy. ""One thing that customers have taken away from this pandemic is that they can actually fend for themselves at home,"" said Anthony Strong, the owner of the year-old Prairie, a mesquite-grill restaurant in the Mission District of San Francisco that is now a grocery store, which it likely will remain during the daytime. ""I think that should be encouraged."" Large food distributors are still cautiously sizing up home cooks. Others have embraced them. In normal times, restaurant suppliers are essentially nutritional credit unions, giving clients ingredients in exchange for a promise to pay in 30 days or 60 days, if they didn't go out of business first. Retail customers, though, have a peculiar habit of paying up front. This has proved to be a boon for some companies.

""The cash flow model is incredible,"" said Adrian Hoffman, an owner of Four Star Seafood, in San Francisco, which over a single weekend in March rerouted its fleet of 13 fish trucks from high-end Bay Area restaurants to the home addresses of individual customers. Why not keep supplying them with special soy sauces from Japan, unusual oils and, on special request, eggs, Mr. Hoffman thought, for at least a portion of his trade? ""We certainly don't want to let this go when this is all done,"" he said. ""Selling directly to consumers is almost a better business in that it spits out enough cash to pay off everything we owed."" Baldor Specialty Foods, a Bronx wholesaler specializing in produce and meat, started with a $250 minimum for home deliveries in March, but quickly dropped it to $200. The company also expanded its delivery zones, which radiate out of Washington, New York and Boston to beach towns stretching from Maryland to coastal New Hampshire.

On Tuesday mornings, when their online store starts taking new orders, they sometimes sit and watch as items sell out within minutes. ""For a small specialty market in our part of the country, we don't usually have the problem of not being able to meet the demand,"" Ms. Bjerke-Harvey said. Restaurants have often had access to ingredients that their customers didn't know about or couldn't get their hands on. Getting a farmer or cheesemaker or winery to grant an exclusive on some obscure, delicious item used to be a considered a victory for chefs. The pandemic has put those relationships in a different perspective. ""There is this group of farms that relied on us, some of them 100 percent,"" Dan Barber, the chef of Blue Hill, in Manhattan, and Blue Hill at Stone Barns, in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., said. ""It feels like the ultimate expression of support. Then in a moment like this you realize you've created the weakest food chain imaginable."" To keep cash circulating to the farmers, foragers and fishing crews that depend on Blue Hill, Mr. Barber began selling boxes of fish, meat or seasonal vegetables for curbside pickup. Customers get a grab bag of ingredients both well-known (greenhouse cucumbers) and less familiar (Purple Sword celtuce stalks). Tucked into the boxes are recipes and background on the crops, including the information that the telltale holes in ""beetle-bitten brassicas"" were left by flea beetles, who have a knack for finding the sweetest plants in the field. As supply-chain disruptions have caused shortages in commodity beef and pork, meat from old livestock breeds raised on pastures has taken its place in some areas where a few small, regional slaughterhouses still remain. Grass & Bone, a butcher shop and restaurant in Mystic, Conn., has been flooded with orders for everything from grass-fed ground beef to lamb hearts and trotters. To supplement these cuts, James Wayman, the chef and an owner, also makes items like garlic-rosemary pork liver mousse, pasta sauces, and kits for tacos and burger

For some restaurants, these kits straddle a line between raw ingredients and takeout, giving them something to sell that grocery stores can't. Shouk, a fast-casual Israeli restaurant in Washington, is now selling its hummus, which customers have been clamoring for, as well as falafel kits to ""help you get to the last mile at dinner,"" said Ran Nussbacher, a founder. (At least until this week, when protesters broke a window in the shop.) ""Raw falafel mix is really, really hard to do at home,"" he said. ""We use an industrial strength meat grinder, and a food processor at home won't get the same texture."" These are all things he assumes customers will crave whenever Shouk's regular business returns to full strength. ""Anything we implement today is only something we think will work in the long term, not just to survive right now,"" Mr. Nussbacher said. Until the virus is brought under control, many restaurants will have to configure their dining rooms in new ways. In March, Good Dog Houston converted its two locations to convenience stores modeled loosely on New York City's bodegas, selling dried pasta and beans, canned tomatoes, paper towels and its own line of hot-dog kits. Last month, when the restaurants were allowed to reopen with strict limitations on indoor seating, they displayed grocery items on tables that they would otherwise have had to remove or leave empty. With the spoils, though, come the troubles. Home cooks, just like chefs, are learning about botched deliveries and products that don't live up to their billing. Ordering from wholesalers can also mean ending up with five liters of balsamic vinegar or carrots the size of a small child. But for Mr. Strong and other restaurateurs, the ability to offer provisions, cooking advice and food delivery is likely going to remain good business.","Without chefs to sell to, farmers, fishmongers and wholesalers are making house calls.

Economy,China Finds California Wine Pairs Well With a Trade War,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/business/economy/china-wine-trade.html,"Stephanie and Michael Honig of Honig Vineyard and Winery in Napa Valley, who have worked to build a Chinese clientele. Mr. Honig said California wines were vulnerable in a trade war because ""we are not a commodity.""Credit...Jason Henry for The New York Times



Stephanie and Michael Honig of Honig Vineyard and Winery in Napa Valley, who have worked to build a Chinese clientele. Mr. Honig said California wines were vulnerable in a trade war because ""we are not a commodity.""

Cabernet isn't the most obvious pawn in a trade war between the United States and China. Airplanes and their parts are the leading American export to China. Soybeans and wheat grow in Trump country. But China's selection of wine as a target of retaliatory tariffs did not surprise Michael Honig, a winemaker in the Napa Valley, where the tariff would hit hardest. ""The reason the government realizes they should penalize us is, we are branded,"" said Mr. Honig, the president of Honig Vineyard and Winery. ""It's hard to go after a wheat grower, because who is a wheat grower? It's a commodity. We are not a commodity."" The news was an unwelcome turn of events for Mr. Honig and many California winemakers, who have spent years trying to carve out a place in the hearts of wealthy Chinese consumers. That hard work has earned them a prized sliver of what is becoming one of the fastest-growing markets for wine imports.

China's imports of American wine reached $82 million last year -- not including bottles entering duty-free through Hong Kong -- a sevenfold increase in the last decade. But growing visibility may have turned Napa wine into easy prey. ""Wine is something people can relate to,"" said Jim Boyce, who has been covering the industry from Beijing for a decade on his blog, the Grape Wall of China. ""It's like putting a tariff on Chinese dumplings. It's something you can feel on an emotional and personal level."" The 15 percent tariff, announced Monday, on top of existing tariffs and taxes, is a gut punch to winemakers marketing their wares to the mushrooming legions of young, recently wealthy Chinese.

Mr. Honig and his business partner and wife, Stephanie, have spent a decade wooing that clientele, making a trip a year to China to pitch sommeliers in top restaurants and hotels. He has recently expanded beyond the obvious stops in Beijing and Shanghai, visiting cities like Guangzhou, in southern China. ""There are people who want to spend the most, but there are also aspirational buyers,"" Mr. Honig said. ""You may want to buy the Rolls-Royce, but you can afford the Mercedes."" And that's his sweet spot. His most popular cabernet goes for around $25 a bottle wholesale, and he sends more than 500 cases of it every year to a plucky Shanghai importing business started by two brothers with dual citizenship. With existing tariffs and value-added taxes mixed in, the total charge tacked on to California wine was already close to 50 percent. After the importer factors in shipping, takes its cut and passes the bottles to a hotel or retail store, which takes its cut, the Napa red ends up selling for the equivalent of around $100. An extra 15 percent charge would be brutal. ""No one wants to overpay,"" Mr. Honig said. ""If all they're looking at is two different bottles side by side, and we are competing with Australia and Chile, that's a big competitive disadvantage."" Chilean and New Zealand wines face no Chinese levies, thanks to free-trade agreements. Australian bottles will enter the country tariff-free next year.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Larry Yang, an importer in Shanghai, said his customers liked California wines, but not enough to ignore an even higher price tag. The wine isn't cheap as it is, he said, and if it gets pricier, he will look elsewhere.

And Chinese drinkers have a growing array of homegrown brands to choose from. Expert winemakers have spent years harvesting cabernet sauvignon, merlot and cabernet franc varietals at the foothills of the Helan Mountains in Ningxia, a region that borders Inner Mongolia. They have started winning international awards, even beating out French favorites. Then the government began protecting its domestic players. When the European Union put tariffs on Chinese solar panels in 2013, Beijing blustered back by opening an inquiry into whether European winemakers were dumping cheap, improperly subsidized bottles onto the Chinese market. It ended the investigation a year later, after the Europeans agreed to help train Chinese winemakers. Sophisticated wine shops have sprouted up across Shanghai, the online retailer Alibaba now runs a yearly wine sale, and other sites will deliver cases to people's doors within two days. In August, China got its first master sommelier, a distinction reserved for people who can pass a rigorous series of tests, including verbal and tasting exams. It wasn't like this when David Pearson made his first business trip to Beijing 15 years ago, intent on selling Chinese customers on his super-premium Napa wine Opus One. The rich drank French Bordeaux if they drank wine at all. He had to make the case for his California winery, a joint venture between Robert Mondavi and Baron Philippe de Rothschild. ""People will buy symbols of luxury -- watches, cars, expensive bottles of wine -- to demonstrate they have the means to do that,"" said Mr. Pearson, the Opus One chief executive. ""There was no middle market. You were either spending all your money on the highest quality of wine or you couldn't afford to buy anything other than the least expensive wine."" The change started when Xi Jinping became president in 2013 and began an anti-corruption campaign that zeroed in on illicit gift-giving. Wine imports dipped for a couple of years but then recovered as sellers began to learn how to market to a person who would buy a bottle at a time, not several cases.

""The distributors who learned how to deal with consumers survived and got better at it,"" said Mr. Boyce, the wine blogger. It isn't clear how exactly the new tariffs will affect Opus One. Mr. Pearson sells the wine to a group of intermediaries in France known as negociants, who then send it to Chinese importers. It's also unlikely that anyone willing to spend the $600 for Opus One in China would even notice the added charge. The middle-market wine buyer -- with $20 or so to spare -- would notice. France and Australia are already monsters in that market, sending half of all of the foreign wine that went to China last year. The United States share is just 2 percent, and it has been shrinking. The Wine Institute, which represents California growers, says that's partly because they're selling less for a higher price. ""California has had a tough time getting into the conversation,"" said David Amadia, the president of Ridge Vineyards. ""It wasn't considered a top wine region in China."" After his Geyserville zinfandel blend was served at a meeting between Mr. Xi and President Barack Obama in 2013, a flurry of new importers began asking for 1,000 cases at a time. He was initially excited about the attention. Then he realized he had no idea where it was going, or who exactly was so interested in it. ""We had concerns about gray market and counterfeiting,"" he said. So he rejected those orders, and says other American winemakers may also be choosing control over quantity. No one knows how much fake wine flows in China, but experts say French and Australian labels are stolen most often, and slapped on random bottles, because they are so well known and abundant.

On Mr. Pearson's desk, in Napa, he has a box of counterfeit Opus wines on display. The scammers did a terrific job on the box, he said, other than the ""X"" they inserted into the name Rothschild. ""Part of me takes a strange amount of pride in it,"" he said.

Fashion & Style,Natural Beauty 2.0: Credo Comes to Town,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/fashion/credo-natural-beauty-skin-care.html,"When the founders of Credo, a beauty boutique that opened in New York last week, were planning how the store should look, they checked out other green spaces -- ones that sold, say, yoga mats made of recycled rubber -- and thought a lot about the differences between a Tesla and a Prius. ""We wanted to be Tesla,"" said Annie Jackson, Credo's vice president for merchandising and planning. ""We didn't want the terrariums and the Zen music in our store."" What Credo, a Sephora-like one-stop shop that opened its first outpost in San Francisco last June, is selling is face creams and eyeliners from companies that don't use any of the ingredients it says are harmful, like formaldehyde or parabens. The list bans 23 groups of ingredients, like animal products and phthalates, a class of plasticizing chemicals.

But what Credo is really selling is the idea of switching up your beauty routine to one that seems healthier in a way that won't take you far out of your comfort zone, much as Whole Foods did with groceries or Gwyneth Paltrow does with everything. This is the kind of wellness aimed at those who recycle their Nespresso pods. In general, when it comes to knowing if what is in your moisturizing balm is bad for you, it's a murky, marketing-driven world. The Food and Drug Administration oversees only certain topical products like sunscreen, and other than requiring that labels don't misstate benefits, it lets the beauty industry regulate itself. Words like natural, nontoxic and safe have no official or legal meaning when it comes to cosmetic labeling, and dermatologists routinely caution that people can be allergic to any ingredient, natural or not.

""We want you to buy all of the brands you love and then buy ours,"" he said. ""We don't want to dis the brand you love."" The new store, at 9 Prince Street in NoLIta, is marked by a bright blue storefront, with windows big enough to please any exhibitionist. In the airy, whitewashed space, blond-wood display cases are stocked with artisanal products, all with sleek logos and modern wrapping -- skin care on one side of the store, makeup on the other. Nothing is made of hemp.

Some brands tend to have personal back stories, like Suntegrity Skincare, a line of plant-derived sunscreen that was developed after the founder's mother died from skin cancer. The green skin-care doyenne Tata Harper's line is front and center, and there are hard-to-find natural products like gel eyeliners (made by Evelyn Iona) and roll-on deodorants (from True Organic of Sweden). Credo also carries kohl eyeliners and glossy eye shadows by the makeup artist Jillian Dempsey (she's planning to sculpt a display case for the products herself). ""We don't spend a lot of time going off on a tangent about why it's good for you,"" Mr. Batra said. ""You just come in, say you want a good moisturizer and SPF, and we get you a good moisturizer and SPF."" The store also offers brow waxing, mini facials and makeup touch ups.","The one-stop eco-beauty boutique, newly arrived from San Francisco, wants to be the Tesla of the cosmetics world.",e843c988-e0fe-558c-ab05-971c7f1b2114,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/19/fashion/19CREDO-WEB1/19CREDO-WEB1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=121a6e87b686a847239d7beba1d0ae21f493d68a6ce0b1853b474bc99aba3de2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Credo's new store, in NoLIta.

Travel,36 Hours in Bogotá,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/travel/what-to-do-in-bogota.html,"Bogota just gets better and better. The city hums with energy and possibility, offering a thriving environment for creativity that makes its negative aspects -- the pollution, the traffic -- not quite as noticeable. These days, Bogota is blossoming with new ideas, from collectives that house everything from feminist bookshops to hair salons, to offbeat, all-day bars that organize gay tango events, to exquisite dining in rough-and-ready neighborhoods. The dazzling talents of Bogotanos, from culinary flourishes to chic shoemaking to visual art innovation, is on display like never before.

Scattered between the garages and auto parts shops of the San Felipe neighborhood are a dozen of the city's newer art galleries. Spend an afternoon strolling the small streets, exploring work by new and established Colombian and Latin American artists. Instituto de Vision, run by a team of women, is worth seeking out -- there's no sign outside, just an old-school punctuation mark emoji on the door -- for its dedication to up-and-coming artists. On a recent visit, SGR Galeria was exhibiting a collection of cartoon-inspired landscape paintings by the Colombian artist Paula Senior, and FLORA ars + natura had a show of work by the noteworthy Venezuelan artist Ricardo Obregon. In between galleries, stop by Azahar Coffee, a newly opened outpost from one of the city's artisanal coffee companies, for a caffeine jolt or artisanal ginger-and-chili soda.

Bogota has gone cocktail crazy. Mixologists from San Francisco, New York and elsewhere are designing menus around the city, complementing the skills of local bartenders who reach deep into Colombia's astounding array of local ingredients for inspiration. Charming Huerta Bar Cocteleria Artesanal, in the tony Quinta Camacho, has a handful of menus: a seasonal menu, a menu of fruitier drinks and one that focuses on more alcohol-forward concoctions. Enthusiastic bartenders tout the virtues of purple cucumber, shiitake mushroom elixir and eucalyptus-infused vermouth; try telling them what you usually like and give them free rein. If cocktails aren't for you, El Mono Bandido, just around the corner, is at the top of the city's equally popular craft beer wave.

Like all the best neighborhood restaurants, El Chato has cheery service, shareable dishes and fills up nightly with groups of friends gathering among the hodgepodge of bookcases and tables for lively celebrations. Book ahead for dinner at this cozy spot, where the chef Alvaro Clavijo's impeccable pedigree (he's worked at Noma and Per Se) is put to good use in the surprisingly approachable menu of dishes that recently included grilled mushrooms and squid in a nettle broth, lamb ribs dusted with feta and sunflower seeds, and corn-flavored ice cream. Dinner for two runs around 200,000 Colombian pesos, or about $63. Everything is served with local beer and a smile.

It's possible to lose hours wandering the paths of Paloquemao: This enormous market is lined with stalls piled high with colorful and extraordinarily varied fruits, and dozens of species of potatoes. You can breakfast for less than the equivalent of $5 on arepas fresh off the grill and stuffed with cheese, along with juices made from mango, strawberry, lulo and many more fruits you've never seen or heard of before. In between snacking and sampling new produce, stock up on woven baskets, bird cages and bottles of colorful potions for various purposes, including attracting money, scaring off spirits, securing good luck and raising the dead. Check out some of Bogota's most interesting designers at Casa Precis, where you'll find shoes from Gal vs. Buck, a gender-neutral line of colorful leather wingtips with fringe . You can also pick up chic straw hats, jewelry and brightly patterned swimsuits from the Colombian label Baobab. Trama Casa de Creadores is a former house where each room is now occupied by a different business. There's a hairdresser and tattoo artist if you want a new look, but for something less permanent pick up fabulous high-waisted pants and skirts made in Colombia from colorfully patterned African cloth, designed by Lia Samantha. Upstairs at Alma de Coco, artisanal body lotions, face masks and cosmetics are made from cacao and coconut oil from Colombia's Pacific Coast. El Telar de las Palabras, a bookshop selling only books by women, is on the ground floor.

The resting place for politicians and sculptors , Bogota's Cementerio Central is a shabby, romantic and still-majestic place to visit. Its mausoleums, in varying states of upkeep, hold the remains of a dozen Colombian presidents, illustrious families and artists. Walk the paths and you'll see ornate statues, locals lighting candles, and the faithful leaving flowers and prayers at the feet of the Virgin Mary statue. It's probably the most tranquil place in the city. Note that you may be asked for identification to enter. From here, stroll a block down Calle 24, past colorful street art, to Cafe de la Fonda, a quiet neighborhood spot, for an excellent cup of Colombian coffee. Pick up a few bags (12,000 Colombian pesos) to bring home while you're at it. Bogota is now home to a number of clever collectives: complexes that house shops, bars, cafes and sometimes performance spaces under one roof, and which are perfect places to stop for a midday break. For a gay-friendly, artsy space, head to A Seis Manos, where small stores sell vintage clothes, ceramics and trendy enamel pins, and a whimsically decorated all-day bar turns out reasonably priced cocktails and coffees. Check the calendar for the roster of activities, which range from gay tango to pub quizzes. For a swankier option, try Casa Arsenal, where the city's well-heeled relax in a courtyard filled with tables and chairs, surrounded by miniature versions of chic craft breweries, cafes, patisseries and restaurants, as well as a bookshop and a co-working space. Set aside several hours for dinner at one of Bogota's most fun and inventive restaurants. Villanos en Bermudas (Villains in Shorts) is the brainchild of a Mexican and an Argentine chef, who have turned this elegant house in Chapinero into a serious dining destination. Start with a cocktail, then move on to the 10-course tasting menu, which might range from simple dishes like homemade bread dipped in fermented black garlic butter, to more complex creations like chickpea mousse with passion fruit ice cream. The menu changes every couple of weeks. Dinner for two, around 300,000 Colombian pesos.

On Sunday mornings, much of Carrera 7, one of the city's main arteries, is closed to vehicles, and locals hit the street to cycle, jog and walk their dogs. Join them for a run or stroll, stopping to breakfast on fresh juice and fruit salad at one of the numerous stalls set up along the way. Free fitness classes, part of a citywide health initiative, are held in many of the city's parks throughout the morning, so aim to stop by one on your stroll (Parque Nacional Enrique Olaya Herrera is usually a fun spot, a favorite of 20-somethings dressed like they just came from the club). Led by enthusiastic instructors, with rhythmic music blasting, these are energetic, informal and full of locals of all ages and fitness levels, following along and having a great time, rain or shine. Sunday, when much of the city shuts down, is an excellent day for leisurely museum explorations. Bogota's Museo del Oro (free on Sundays, 4,000 pesos at other times) is deservedly famous for its immense and well-signed collection of intricate, glowing masks, statues and jewelry that date back to pre-Hispanic times. After you've had your fill of the shiny stuff, turn south on Carrera 7 for several activity-packed blocks of games, street performances, live music, food stalls and more. It's a popular city gathering place for affordable fun on Sunday afternoons.

If climbing the steep mile up Monserrate Mountain isn't your thing, get a milder workout by walking around the hilly paths and gardens of the one-time home of the Liberator, Simon Bolivar. The simply furnished rooms of the Quinta de Bolivar (free on Sundays, 3,000 pesos at other times) are surrounded by cobblestone paths that curve through an enormous variety of plants and statues. Bolivar didn't live here for much of the 10 years that he owned the house, but you can see why he came back here between independence campaigns : The lush gardens are surprisingly free from urban noise and offer some of the freshest, least polluted air in the city. If you're looking to rent an apartment through Airbnb for your stay, there is a good range of apartments in Chapinero, a central neighborhood with easy access to both the north and south of the city. Expect to pay between $40 and $90 for a one-bedroom. The landmark building housing the Four Seasons Casa Medina (Carrera 7 #69A-22; fourseasons.com/bogotacm; doubles from $359) is just steps from the city's best restaurant neighborhood, the Zona Gourmet; its individually designed rooms offer beamed ceilings and fireplaces.","In the Colombian capital: a gallery scene that celebrates local artists, a rapidly evolving food and bar culture, and much else to explore.",8cdb05df-4328-50fd-b7b3-bf1656110838,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/06/travel/06hours-bogota8/06hours-bogota8-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=81706ebc0f0a3d88eb69da984d7216a4cdd2877e5d24c3d60713f286d8607e94&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"La Candelaria, a neighborhood in Bogot&aacute;, is known for its street art and historic buildings.",8cdb05df-4328-50fd-b7b3-bf1656110838,N24News/imgs/8cdb05df-4328-50fd-b7b3-bf1656110838.jpg,4
Opinion,Weaponizing Truth Against Opioids,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/opinion/opioid-drug-prevention-ads.html,"Ms. Rosenberg is a co-founder of the Solutions Journalism Networ k, which supports rigorous reporting about responses to social problems.







This ad depicts a true story. It begins: A young man walks around his car, which is up on a jack. He says in voice-over: ""I got some Oxy after I hurt my neck. First I took them to feel better. Then I kept taking them. I didn't know they'd be this addictive. I didn't know how far I'd go to get more."" Here's how far he'd go: He lies down under the car. Then he kicks out the jack. You see the car fall, hear a crunch. ""Joe S. from Maine broke his back to get more prescription opioids,"" the screen says. And then a voice-over: ""Opioid dependence can happen after just five days. Know the truth, spread the truth."" A similar ad shows a woman taking off her seatbelt and deliberately crashing her car. In another, a man breaks his hand with a hammer. In another, a man slams his arm in a door. Together, those comprised the first national ad campaign in America aimed at preventing opioid misuse. They came from the Truth Initiative, the organization that was behind truth ads that helped bring about one of the most important public health victories in American history: In 1996, 34 percent of high school seniors had smoked a cigarette in the previous month -- the same as in 1975. But by 2019, less than 6 percent smoked.

Can the strategy work again? Let's look at what the group did right in its antismoking campaign. Before the truth ads, antismoking ads for teenagers were created by public health experts who, not surprisingly, emphasized that cigarettes can kill you. That threat works well to encourage adults to quit smoking. But it doesn't prevent teens from starting. For many adolescents, the danger is a lure; they smoke to rebel against preachy adults. To them, the consequences are decades away, and teens are immortal. In the 1990s, Florida and California hired advertising agencies that didn't know about public health, but did know about selling to teens. They created ads to redirect teenage rebellion against the manipulations of the tobacco industry. Some examples:
* None One California advertisement portrayed tobacco executives in a smoke-filled room, cackling maniacally as they plot to replace 1,100 customers who quit smoking every day -- ""Actually, technically, they die,"" one says.
* None Another ad showed rappers attacking Big Tobacco for targeting African-Americans with menthol cigarettes. It ended, ""We used to pick it; now they want us to smoke it.""
* None In Florida, teenagers created ads for a campaign they named ""truth."" One showed girls making prank phone calls to tobacco ad executives. ""What is the lucky part about Lucky Strike cigarettes?"" a girl asks. ""It is because"" (pause) I might live?"" That was in 1998. Over the next two years, teen smoking in Florida fell by 17.5 percent. Florida was one of the first states to sue tobacco companies. When a nationwide settlement was reached, part of the money created a national truth campaign. It copied Florida's strategies and hired its people. And it enjoyed the same success.

Of course, truth ads were only one part of this victory. States and cities raised their cigarette taxes. Indoor smoking vanished. But the ads were crucial. Those truth ads still target adolescent smoking. New teenagers are minted every year, so the campaign never ends. It also makes ""Ditch Juul"" ads that show teens creatively demolishing their vaping equipment. All this is useful for anti-opioid campaigns. ""There's a lot of crossover in terms of strategy for reaching your target audience of youth,"" said Matthew Farrelly, senior director of the Center for Health Policy Science and Tobacco Research at RTI International in North Carolina. ""The variety of tactics for getting in front of teens is nearly identical."" Surveys about the truth ads show that 80 percent of teenagers recognize the brand. And the organization knows what works. A review of published studies in 2014 concluded, ""Youth are more likely to recall and think about advertising that includes personal testimonials; a surprising narrative; and intense images, sound and editing."" That's Joe S. from Maine, all right. Anti-opioid ads can use the antismoking template, but the message must be different. ""Nobody needs education on the fact that tobacco is really bad for you,"" said Robin Koval, president and chief executive of the Truth Initiative. ""With opioids, we found out how little people know."" Adolescents know about the misery of addiction -- and addiction and overdose at 20 are scary in a way lung cancer at 60 is not. ""But there is a lack of understanding and awareness of how easily you can become addicted,"" Ms. Koval said.

Some adolescents start using opioids because their friends share. For others, the beginning is pain medication. Getting a prescription in high school after knee surgery or wisdom teeth removal is associated with a 33 percent higher chance of misusing opioids later in life. A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded, ""The probability of long-term opioid use increases sharply in the first days of therapy"" -- with a spike after five days. So every truth ad ends with: ""Opioid dependence can happen after just five days."" ""The hardest thing to go up against is nobody believes they're going to become addicted to opioids,"" Ms. Koval said. ""We had to reverse this notion of otherness. And we have to combat the stigma that says: This is a moral failing and therefore I can't believe it would happen to me or anybody we know."" The Joe S. ad is part of a campaign that began in July 2018, in collaboration with the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Ad Council. Facebook, Google, Turner, Amazon and Vice donated advertising time or space. (The Google News Initiative is a funder of the Solutions Journalism Network, my employer.)

Last year, a truth video titled ""Treatment Box: Rebekkah's Story,"" won an Emmy. In it, Rebekkah, then 26, started using opioids at 14 after a cheerleading injury. The ad showed her detoxing -- minute by minute. The video was projected into a clear glass bedroom-size box in Times Square. Passers-by watched Rebekkah's pain. A new ad series, ""Best Day,"" has a relatable ""it could be you"" message, said Margie Skeer, associate professor at Tufts University School of Medicine. It's graduation day, or signing day for college sports, or a basketball awards assembly -- but the happy teens explain that on this, their best day, they see their futures as bleak: that the pain of adult stress or a sports injury will lead them to opioids, then addiction, and finally to overdosing. ""My mom will bury me with my cleats,"" one girl says.

""It's maybe not quite as elaborate and creative and multifaceted as the truth campaign,"" said Dr. Farrelly. ""But if their goal is to raise awareness of risk, it might not be a bad strategy."" But that's not the same as avoiding addiction. The gripping Joe S. ads produce horror and fear. ""Fear works in the moment,"" Dr. Skeer said. ""But when people are scared but don't know what to do next, it can become paralyzing."" Other public health researchers also said that the ads needed to answer the question: ""O.K., so what should I do?"" The truth campaign responded that opioids were complicated, and that covering various scenarios in the ad would have been confusing. Instead, it seeks to drive young people to the Truth Initiative website, where they can get advice. The first ads should have a clear focus on ""telling stories that felt authentic and true in the voices of young people,"" Ms. Koval said. ""Helping them to understand this can happen to you.""

Style,House Calls for Everything!,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/style/coronavirus-manicures-haircuts-tattoos-dog-groomer-at-home.html,"The masked manicure: Genesis Aguirre (left) and Marianella Aguirre (right) of Green Spa tend to the talons of Ashley Lauren Barton (center) at Ms. Barton's apartment in Long Island City.





In the middle of May, Ashley Barton sipped a mimosa in her best friend's apartment in Whitestone, Queens, while she enjoyed her first professional manicure and pedicure since New York enacted stay-at-home orders. The in-house experience, with candles burning and soft music playing, was a game changer. Before the pandemic, Ms. Barton, a 33-year-old publicist, would drive from her apartment in Long Island City to a salon near her parents' house on Long Island to get a mani-pedi. But not anymore. ""There is something about the comfort of doing this in your own home, to have someone holding your foot like it is the most amazing thing,"" Ms. Barton said. ""I won't forget when I heard the clippers come out. It sounded like someone was popping bottles of Dom Perignon."" Though New York City hair and nail salons reopened on July 6, Ms. Barton doubts she'll return to them anytime soon. She has since become a regular client of Green Spa on the Go, a manicurist from Forest Hills that offers in-home manicures and pedicures that range from $140 to $300, depending on location. Ms. Barton now gets them done with her parents at their home every two weeks.

""I'm not ready to sit in a nail salon, even with this protective gear. I'd rather just be in my parents' backyard doing my nails and toes,"" she said. ""I can control the environment."" As the country undergoes a Sisyphean-seeming reopening with infection rates rising in many regions, many Americans are still wary of venturing out. To accommodate skittish clients who have neglected their basic grooming for months, a cadre of service providers -- personal trainers, hair stylists, tattoo artists, pet groomers and spiritual advisers -- have been making house calls, or plan to start doing so soon. They have been fielding calls from clients eager to receive services in their living rooms, backyards and balconies. For providers who always had an in-home component to their business, this period of seclusion has proved to be a boon, giving them an edge at an anxious time. They've attracted new clients who never considered house calls before, but have since discovered that they like private pampering. ""We believe this is a long term shift in consumer behavior,"" said Amy Shecter, the chief executive of Glamsquad, an in-home beauty company headquartered in New York City that offers services including blowouts, manicures, pedicures and makeup application. Glamsquad has resumed its usual services and introduced haircuts in New York, Florida, Boston and Washington, D.C. In Los Angeles, the company moved services outdoors after the state rolled back its reopening plans. (Its San Francisco market remains closed.) Workers undergo safety training to reduce the chance of coronavirus transmission and wear personal protective gear during visits.

Marianella Aguirre, the founder of Green Spa on the Go, which specializes in house calls in New York, Connecticut and the Hamptons, also sees her business model as one that could thrive in the current environment, with anxious clients worried about squeezing into crowded nail salons. ""It's incredible,"" she said. ""It's like we were set up for this."" Before the pandemic, Ms. Aguirre received about five calls a week from new clients. Now she receives as many a day. Nearly all of them request that the service be provided in a backyard. ""They are desperate and they don't want to wait anymore,"" she said. At-home services have always been a niche offering, and there is no data to track if the industry has grown during state-mandated stay-at-home orders, since such services that occurred during that time would have likely been clandestine. But interest does not appear to be limited to the beauty industry. At Groomit, which provides in-house pet grooming services in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, business is up 30 percent since the company started offering services again according to a founder, Sohel Kapadia. ""Even though half of New York City is empty,"" said Mr. Kapadia, referring to the residents who fled the city as it shut down, ""the new customers are making up for the losses of the old customers.""

After months spent huddling at home, many Americans feel safer on their sofa than they do almost anywhere else. But a living room is not necessarily a safer location for a blowout than a salon. With good ventilation, adequate physical distancing and enough personal protective equipment, a salon may actually be less risky than a small, cramped apartment, even if more people pass through the salon. Grooming services may not be safe in any setting in areas where cases are rising, like South Florida. ""We still don't know that much about transmission even though we're bombarded with information about what we do know,"" said Dr. Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. ""Is it safer to have more people in a space, but in a space that is bigger and has better ventilation and has better masking? We can't really quantify what the differences are.""

Joey Chavez, a tattoo artist in Corona, Calif., was able to reopen his tattoo parlor Trusted Tattoo in mid-June, but had been offering services to clients out of a mobile tattoo bus, the Body Art Bus, which he would drive to clients' homes in the weeks before the shop reopened. He sanitized the vehicle between clients, used disposable equipment and limited the number of people in the space to only himself and client. ""It is a lot safer for us to come to their homes,"" said Mr. Chavez, who charges a $250 fee for the service on top of the $150-per-hour fee for a tattoo. ""We bring a fully disinfectable mobile tattoo parlor."" Before the pandemic, the Body Art Bus was primarily used for social occasions like bachelorette and birthday parties, and once the tattoo parlor reopened, he began bringing the bus to smaller house parties again. The bus, which he has operated for 10 years, has attracted celebrity clients too, including Katy Perry, who rented it for an event, and Tech N9ne, who brought the bus along on a tour. But now, Mr. Chavez sees the bus as a way to showcase how safe body art can be during a pandemic. ""There are a lot of people who are afraid"" to go back to a parlor, he said.

Samuel Sanchez is one of them. Mr. Sanchez, 49, a substitute teacher who's studying speech pathology at California State University San Marcos, had a March appointment at Mr. Chavez's studio to restore a 25-year-old dragon tattoo etched across his back. But as news of coronavirus percolated through California, Mr. Sanchez's wife told him to cancel. ""I felt like the universe was saying maybe you shouldn't do this,"" he said. Mr. Sanchez, who lives in Menifee, Calif., was devastated. Two years earlier, he had been in a serious car accident, with injuries and subsequent surgeries that left deep scarring across his back, severing his tattoo. He saw his window to get the tattoo restored closing. But after Mr. Chavez showed him the bus and the equipment, Mr. Sanchez was convinced that it was the safest way to get inked. ""The whole thing is pampered. You're sitting on killer chairs. He sterilized everything. You sign a waiver. You walk into the bus and only the tattoo artist and you,"" Mr. Sanchez said. ""I felt like the bus was the most sterile thing I could do."" In mid-June, Mr. Sanchez had the first of four sessions to restore the tattoo. During that appointment, which took about four hours, he discovered another upside to a bus: He could avoid the prying eyes of other customers at a crowded tattoo parlor. ""It takes all the machismo out of it,"" he said. ""You don't got all these bystanders and people watching to see if you're squirming or not. It's you and your guy."" Reopening a business that makes house calls during a pandemic is not without its risks. On June 27, Mr. Chavez had to shut down Trusted Tattoo and the bus for two weeks after a client tested positive for coronavirus soon after a Body Art Bus tattoo session. Mr. Chavez and another tattoo artist who had also been on the bus quarantined for two weeks. Mr. Chavez reopened his businesses on July 13, only for local health department officials to shut them down almost immediately, as the state tightened its quarantine restrictions.

But for those who can receive them, house calls can be a salve for people isolated in a difficult time. In May, clients started calling Nini Grace, a spiritual life coach and medium in Avon-by-the-Sea, N.J., requesting house calls.

Art & Design,"Up for Bid, AI Art Signed 'Algorithm'",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/arts/design/christies-art-artificial-intelligence-obvious.html,"With their eyes trained on a gilded frame containing a smeared, half-formed image of a distinguished gentleman, a small group of potential bidders gathered Friday night over cocktails at Christie's New York and heard the pitch: here was the first portrait generated by an algorithm to come up for auction. The portrait, produced by artificial intelligence, hung on the wall opposite an Andy Warhol print and just to the right of a bronze work by Roy Lichtenstein. There were some smiles and at least one frown. Two people snapped cellphone pictures of the work, which looked as though someone had taken a sponge to a 17th-century oil portrait. The arrival of what some call the infant stages of the next great art movement at one of the world's leading auction houses was greeted nonchalantly, with a nod of understanding and a sip of mezcal margarita. Christie's is hoping for a more explosive reaction on Thursday, when the gavel comes down on ""Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy,"" formally testing the art market's interest in AI art. The work -- estimated at $7,000-$10,000 -- was a collaboration by the members of Obvious, a French trio composed of a student of machine learning and two business school graduates, none of whom have a background in art. There was no paint or brushes involved, just an algorithm that learns to imitate sets of images fed by humans -- in this case, thousands of portraits spanning the 14th century to the 20th.

But is it art? Frederique Baumgartner, an art historian at Columbia University, said the AI work raised questions about ""intention and authorship,"" but so, too, did artists from the past, including Marcel Duchamp (who famously made art out of a urinal). She went on to compare the portrait's contrasting tones, coupled with the subject's sober dress, with the old master of the Dutch Golden Age, Rembrandt van Rijn -- though she quickly added, ""That's if I look half-closing my eyes.""

The unusual sale shows the challenge traditional auction houses face staying relevant in a culture that moves at WiFi-enabled speeds. Christie's -- which shattered auction-house records in 2017 when it sold a $450 million Leonardo da Vinci painting -- reached out directly to Obvious this year, rather than working through a seller. (It is the only AI work in Thursday's sale of 363 lots.) Surprisingly, the loudest criticism has come not from the art establishment but from the small but passionate community of artists who work with AI, many of whom say that what Christie's and Obvious suggested was groundbreaking was in fact effectively AI Art 101. Ahmed Elgammal, the director of the Art and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Rutgers University, said that the technology used to create the work, Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs, had been used by artists since around 2015. ""This group was totally irrelevant,"" he scoffed. Mario Klingemann, a German artist known for his work with GANs, put it bluntly. ""When I saw that announcement"" of the auction, he said, ""my reaction was 'you can't be serious.'"" He compared the portrait by Obvious ""to a connect-the-dots children's painting."" Richard Lloyd, the International Head of the Prints & Multiples department at Christie's, who brought the work in, acknowledged that he hadn't made an exhaustive search of the small but very active field of AI art. ""I just responded to it and thought it'd be cool,"" he said.

What struck Mr. Lloyd most, he said, was the work's resemblance to European portraiture. ""It looks like something you'd expect Christie's to sell,"" he explained. ""We're the people who sold the Leonardo for $450 million."" He thought that the work Obvious was doing would be a good way to ease potential buyers at Christie's into work made with AI. ""I like the fact that it didn't at first blush look different,"" he said. Many artists and researchers who specialize in artistic applications of AI technology, while generally glad of the potential exposure the sale could bring, say that the portrait chosen by Christie's is derivative. Codes written to produce the kind of images Obvious has made are also shared freely online among enthusiasts, raising questions of originality. For its part, Obvious acknowledges that the technology it used was gleaned from others. ""It's open source,"" explained Pierre Fautrel, one of the group's members, in an interview in New York last week. ""We took a lot of different parts from different people.""

The biggest difference between the Obvious portrait and their predecessors' is the fact that Obvious had theirs printed on canvas and ""signed"" in the bottom right corner with a mathematical function used to produce it. They also had it extravagantly framed. ""We're introducing it to people who do not necessarily know what a GAN algorithm is,"" Mr. Lloyd explained, speaking to the presentation. ""It has to be, all things being equal, comparatively simple.""

The opportunity to capitalize on the buzz surrounding artificial intelligence fits in with Christie's efforts to market itself in new ways. In July it held its first Art & Tech summit, focused on the theme of blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. (Obvious themselves have sold art on SuperRare, an online marketplace that allows users to buy and sell digital artwork using cryptocurrency.) Brick-and-mortar auction houses have been slow to accept art that explores new technologies. To be sure, Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips offer plenty of digitally generated works by blue-chip artists like Andreas Gursky and Christopher Wool. But the sort of digital video and virtual reality pieces that are featured routinely at contemporary art biennials rarely, if ever, appear at auction houses. Artists in the field are hoping that works sold at auctions like Christie's will increasingly enter private collections. That appears to be happening more often. Earlier this year the New Delhi art gallery Nature Morte hosted what was billed as India's first exhibition of work made entirely by AI, including works by Mr. Klingemann, Tom White, Memo Akten, Jake Elwes and Anna Ridler. In December, Dr. Elgammal of Rutgers will exhibit AI art for sale at SCOPE Miami Beach, a satellite fair during the time of Art Basel Miami Beach.","Preparing to test the art market — and young buyers — with ""Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy.""",ea01a415-049f-5dc1-ab73-589140835ed9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/23/arts/23aiportrait5/23aiportrait5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=fd4a8a9acdff47678646e754b91b80d0725551170e3072557798842547c24a0d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy,"" a print on canvas produced by the French collective Obvious, working with artificial intelligence, will be auctioned Thursday at Christie's.",ea01a415-049f-5dc1-ab73-589140835ed9,N24News/imgs/ea01a415-049f-5dc1-ab73-589140835ed9.jpg,14
Science,Expected Soon: First-Ever Photo of a Black Hole,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/science/black-hole-photo.html,"Like terrified moviegoers seated on the edges of their seats and at the mercy of their imaginations, astronomers expect this week to finally see the monster: a supermassive black hole. At 9 a.m. Eastern Time on Wednesday April 10, a group of astronomers who run a globe-girdling network of radio telescopes called the Event Horizon Telescope are expected to unveil their long awaited pictures of a pair of putative black holes. One of the objects sits at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, buried in the depths of interstellar dust and gas, and equivalent in mass to 4.1 million suns that otherwise have disappeared from the visible universe. [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] The other target is in the heart of Messier 87, a giant galaxy in the constellation Virgo, where a black hole 7 billion times the mass of the sun is spewing a jet of energy thousands of light-years across space. According to calculations, and if all has gone well, either or both of the black holes should appear as a tiny shadow backlit by the glow of radio energy at the galactic center.

They might be circular, oval or some other shape entirely, depending on whether they are rotating, or if the Einsteinian equations describing them are slightly wrong, or if they are spitting flares of energy, which is how quasars produce fireworks visible across the universe. In such shadows the dreams of physicists die, time ends, space-time, matter and light disappear into the primordial nothing from which they spring, and the ghosts of Einstein and Hawking mingle with history and memory. For the first time, astronomers will be staring down the pipes of eternity.

If, in fact, astronomers have finally brought the monsters into view at last. The Event Horizon team has been extremely tight-lipped. Nobody knows for certain if either of these black holes, if any, has been imaged. Shep Doeleman, director of the Event Horizon Telescope, was ebullient but guarded when reached last week at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. ""The team is working exceptionally hard to quadruple-check all the results,"" he said.

The unveiling will take place almost exactly a century after images of stars askew in the heavens made Einstein famous and confirmed his theory of general relativity as the law of the cosmos. That theory ascribes gravity to the warping of space and time by matter and energy, much as a mattress sags under a sleeper, and allows for the contents of the universe, including light rays, to follow curved paths. General relativity led to a new conception of the cosmos, in which space-time could quiver, bend, rip, expand, swirl like a mix-master and even disappear forever into the maw of a black hole. To Einstein's surprise, the equations indicated that when too much matter or energy was concentrated in one place, space-time could collapse, trapping matter and light in perpetuity. Einstein disliked that idea, but the consensus today is that the universe is speckled with black holes waiting to vacuum up their surroundings. Many are the gravitational tombstones of stars that have burned up their fuel and collapsed. Any lingering doubts as to their existence vanished three years ago when the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, detected the collision of a pair of distant black holes, which sent a shiver through the fabric of space-time.

Since then, other collisions have been recorded, and black holes have become so humdrum that astronomers no longer bother sending out news releases about them. Nonetheless, astronomers are thrilled at the prospect of finally, actually seeing the previously unseeable. ""Yes, I'm definitely excited to see the image!"" Daniel Holz, of the University of Chicago, wrote in an email. ""It's not really rational, since I know the math works and the theory has been thoroughly tested. But still, this would be a picture of the real thing, up close and personal. That is super cool."" Priyamvada Natarajan, a Yale astrophysicist who is not part of the project, said, ""It's exciting, even just technically, to get this up close and personal to a black hole."" Especially when the black hole is no run-of-the-mill stellar corpse, but one of the behemoths that crouch in the centers of galaxies and direct cosmic weather, launching thunderbolts across thousands of light-years. Even if the new images do not overthrow relativity, they will be invaluable as astronomers' first glimpses into the hearts of these entities and the way they generate cosmically catastrophic energies. The center of the Milky Way, 26,000 light-years from Earth, coincides with a faint source of radio noise called Sagittarius A* (pronounced A-star). By tracking the orbits of stars around this hub, astronomers have calculated that whatever sits at the center has the mass of four million suns.

But it emits no visible or infrared light. If this is not a black hole, no one knows what it could be. The only way to be sure is to peer through the haze and record the shadow of oblivion. Which is no small job. According to the standard Einstein calculations, a black hole with the mass of 4.1 million suns would be only about 15 million miles wide -- a tiny area to observe clearly from this distance. Luckily, the black hole's gravity will magnify it to appear twice that size. But discerning even that is like trying to spot an orange on the Moon with the naked eye. It takes a big telescope to see something so small. Enter the Event Horizon Telescope, named for a black hole's point of no return; whatever crosses the event horizon falls into blackness everlasting. The telescope was the dream-child of Dr. Doeleman, who was inspired to study black holes by examining the mysterious activity in the centers of violent radio galaxies such as M87.

By combining data from radio telescopes as far apart as the South Pole, France, Chile and Hawaii, using a technique called very long baseline interferometry, Dr. Doeleman and his colleagues created a telescope as big as Earth itself. The network has gained antennas and sensitivity over the last decade. In April of 2017, the network of eight telescopes, synchronized by atomic clocks, stared at the Milky Way center and at the giant galaxy M87 off and on for 10 days. Astronomers have taken the last two years to reduce and collate the results. The data were too voluminous to transmit over the internet, and so had to be placed on hard disks and flown back to M.I.T.'s Haystack Observatory, in Westford, Mass., and the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, in Bonn, Germany.",Have astronomers finally recorded an image of a black hole?

Well,The Stoner as Gym Rat,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/well/mind/exercise-marijuana-cannabis-pot-workout.html,"Jeff Bridges as The Dude, left, hanging out at the bowling alley with his buddies Walter (John Goodman) and Donny (Steve Buscemi) in ""The Big Lebowski.""





Defying stereotypes, many people who frequently use cannabis also seem to be people who frequently exercise, according to the first large study of legal marijuana and exercise habits. The study finds that many people who report using cannabis in the hours before or after a workout believe that it makes their exercise more enjoyable and may help motivate them to get out and be active. Fewer of those who exercise and use pot maintain that it actually improves their physical performance while exercising. When we think of marijuana users, many people harbor preconceptions about their lives and lifestyles. The image that comes up for many of us, often cobbled together from watching The Dude in the movie ""The Big Lebowski"" or the misadventures of Harold and Kumar, is of the laid-back stoner who dreamily takes yet another hit on the bong. ""The usual stereotype is of someone lying on his couch for hours, blissed out and eating Doritos,"" says Angela Bryan, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at the University of Colorado Boulder, who oversaw the new study.

Recently, the possibility that this cliche might be accurate had begun to worry her and her colleagues. Her lab studies health behavior and the actions and decisions that tend to promote or reduce people's health. She and her colleagues realized that legalization of recreational cannabis use, which had occurred or was about to in several states, including Colorado, would most likely increase usage. But current government regulations restrict research with the drug, which remains illegal at the federal level. As a result, little has been known about the possible effects of regular cannabis use on behaviors that can affect health, including exercise. [Read more about marijuana and exercise.] ""If using cannabis encourages people to be sedentary and overeat, that obviously would be a concern,"" Dr. Bryan says. But she and her colleagues had no idea whether or not that scenario was true. They sought to find out with their new study, which was published last month in Frontiers in Public Health.

For the study, they first designed a simple questionnaire that asked people some general questions about themselves, including their age, gender, height and weight. More specific questions delved into their relationships with marijuana and workouts. The questionnaire probed how often people exercised or used cannabis and whether they combined the two, using the drug in some form within an hour before or four hours after a workout. It also asked if people felt that using marijuana made their workout more pleasurable, upped or reduced their desire to work out, and possibly hastened their recovery afterward. Then the researchers sought out cannabis users in several of the states where the drug is legal, including Colorado, California, Washington and Oregon, recruiting participants through websites, dispensaries and clinics. They did not approach gyms or similar sites, because their interest was in how cannabis use affects exercise and not the other way around, Dr. Bryan says. Eventually, they wound up with responses from more than 600 men and women who used cannabis, most of whom said they also exercised at least sometimes. The researchers had expected that some, but probably not a majority, of these people would report swallowing, smoking or slathering on cannabis before or after exercise. But they were wrong -- and by a wide margin. It turned out that almost 82 percent of them said that they used cannabis around the time of their workouts. This group tended to be younger, leaner and more often male than those who did not use marijuana in conjunction with exercise. They also exercised more often and imbibed or slathered on more cannabis.

And about 70 percent of them reported that using marijuana increased their enjoyment of workouts, while nearly 80 percent felt it enhanced their recovery, and more than half were convinced it motivated them to be physically active. Only about 35 percent, though, held that it actually raised their exercise performance. These findings should not be seen an endorsement of marijuana as an adjunct to exercise, Dr. Bryan says. But they do suggest that some of our entrenched ideas about cannabis and lifestyle may be outdated. ""Our concern going in was that cannabis use would be detrimental to physical activity,"" Dr. Bryan says. ""Our evidence does not support that idea."" The new study's results are severely limited, though, by being self-assessments from self-selected volunteers who live in possibly unrepresentative states, she adds. ""The states that have legalized cannabis also happen to be the states that we know are the most physically active,"" she says. Whether or not people in less-active states would respond similarly to cannabis if and when it is legalized there is uncertain. The survey also tells us nothing about how cannabis affects people during exercise, including whether it increases injuries, risk-taking or, as some anecdotal evidence indicates, the tendency to giggle and grow easily distracted by the puffiness of clouds while hiking under the influence. It also cannot explain how cannabis affects people's feeling about exercise, although Dr. Bryan suspects that changes in brain chemicals, pain sensitivity and inflammation prompted by the drug are probably involved. She would like to see far more research into cannabis and exercise, she says, but funding and approval for relevant experiments remain difficult to obtain, given current federal regulations.",Many people who frequently use cannabis also seem to be people who frequently exercise.,6bd2f41b-47ec-5315-b3e1-a8f1336edf88,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/14/well/physed-lebowski/merlin_90459992_a1151d64-f3f0-481f-96bd-f483722fedfc-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=f1f1ae77220fb9eae461867d04e5540fc6ef11546da9a7e9599fd0ca6d9221c3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jeff Bridges as The Dude, left, hanging out at the bowling alley with his buddies Walter (John Goodman) and Donny (Steve Buscemi) in &ldquo;The Big Lebowski.&rdquo;",6bd2f41b-47ec-5315-b3e1-a8f1336edf88,N24News/imgs/6bd2f41b-47ec-5315-b3e1-a8f1336edf88.jpg,18
Health,"Education May Cut Dementia Risk, Study Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/11/health/education-may-cut-dementia-risk-study-finds.html,"The risk of developing dementia is decreasing for people with at least a high school education, according to an important new study that suggests that changes in lifestyle and improvements in physical health can help prevent or delay cognitive decline. The study, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, provides the strongest evidence to date that a more educated population and better cardiovascular health are contributing to a decline in new dementia cases over time, or at least helping more people stave off dementia for longer. The findings have implications for health policy and research funding, and they suggest that the long-term cost of dementia care may not be as devastatingly expensive as policy makers had predicted, because more people will be able to live independently longer. There are wild cards that could dampen some of the optimism. The study participants were largely white and suburban, so results may not apply to all races and ethnicities. Still, a recent study showed a similar trend among African-Americans in Indianapolis, finding that new cases of dementia declined from 1992 to 2001. The 2001 participants had more education, and although they had more cardiovascular problems than the 1992 participants, those problems were receiving more medical treatment.

Another question mark is whether obesity and diabetes, which increase dementia risk, will cause a surge in dementia cases when the large number of overweight or diabetic 40- and 50-year-olds become old enough to develop dementia. In any event, in the next few decades, the actual number of dementia patients will increase because baby boomers are aging and living longer. ""You don't want to give the impression that the Alzheimer's or dementia problem is disappearing -- it's not at all,"" said Dallas Anderson, a program director on dementia at the National Institute on Aging, one of two agencies that financed the study. ""The numbers are still going up because of the aging population."" Still, he added, the new research shows that ""what happens in a person's life becomes important."" ""It's not just: 'Oh, it's in your genes. You're going to get it,'"" he said. ""You can take steps to postpone the disease."" The decline reported in the new study was strongest in vascular dementia, which is most directly linked to cardiovascular problems. Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia, also declined, but the trend narrowly missed what researchers consider statistically significant.

Still, Maria Carrillo, chief science officer for the Alzheimer's Association, an advocacy group, said ""this tells me there absolutely is hope for Alzheimer's"" if a push for healthier lifestyles accompanies efforts to find dementia treatments. Dementia experts and advocacy groups have long predicted that the number of Americans with dementia, now about five million, would triple by 2050. But a burst of new research in Europe, Canada and the United States has pointed to decreases in recent decades in more educated populations with better-controlled cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart and lung health. ""There's more studies suggesting that the risk is going down and we might have to rethink some of the projections of how big a problem dementia will be 30 years from now,"" said Dr. Kenneth Langa, a professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan. On Saturday, he will present at an international conference preliminary results from another large study, which found that the prevalence of dementia in a more nationally diverse population declined by about 21 percent from 2000 to 2010. Results like this suggest, he said, ""that even without a big breakthrough in medication or a vaccine that would stop the Alzheimer's process, that we can do things that lower the risk of dementia long-term."" The New England Journal research is considered especially strong because it looked at the emergence of new cases of dementia, or incidence, and is based on data from the Framingham Heart Study, a large collection of detailed health information that began in 1948 with participants from Framingham, Mass., and has continued to follow them and their children and grandchildren.

Significantly, the decline in new dementia cases, or incidence, occurred only with people who had at least a high school diploma. High school graduates were also the only ones whose cardiovascular health, except for obesity and diabetes, improved steadily over the same 40 years. ""Whether education is beneficial in itself or whether education is a marker for other things like poverty and unhealthy lifestyle, we didn't parse that out,"" said Dr. Sudha Seshadri, a neurologist at Boston University Medical Center and a senior investigator with the Framingham Heart Study. Dr. Seshadri said the study did not yield strong evidence that college-educated people had even lower dementia risk, but with small numbers of college graduates in the study's early groups, it was hard to tell. The study led by Dr. Langa, which compared a nationally representative survey of about 10,000 Americans aged 65 and over in 2000 with a similar group in 2010, found more college correlated with less dementia. ""We find the more education the better,"" said Dr. Langa, whose study indicated that people in 2010 averaged almost a year more education than those in 2000 and that education explained about one-half the decline in dementia in that decade. There are many theories about why education may help stave off dementia, including that it leads to better economic opportunity, which can propel healthier habits and better access to medical care. Another theory is that learning generates more neural connections, allowing brains to compensate longer when memory and cognitive functions falter. ""That's a major puzzle: What is the causal effect of education on dementia and cognitive function later in life?"" said Michael D. Hurd, the director of the RAND Center for the Study of Aging. Dr. Hurd, who led a study in 2013 estimating that the cost of dementia care would more than double by 2040, said it was too early to say if that estimate should now be lower. Some people will be living longer with dementia, needing, say, 10 years of nursing home care, instead of three, he said, adding that ""Framingham is not the U.S. population.""

Indeed, another study published Wednesday found significant racial disparities, with African-Americans the most likely group to develop dementia, Asian-Americans the least likely, and whites and Latinos somewhere in between. Not all of the Framingham results could be explained by education or cardiovascular health, Dr. Seshadri said, a reflection of the complexity of dementia. Marie and Joe Porcello, study participants, are 86-year-old high school graduates with no significant cardiovascular problems or family history of dementia. But Mr. Porcello remains healthy, while his wife, a retired secretary, developed dementia about 10 years ago and is in an assisted-living facility. ""I took care of her as long as I can, and then she fell one day when she was getting out of the bathtub,"" Mr. Porcello said. He said his wife usually recognized him, but ""the other day when I went up there, she said, 'Who are you?' and I said 'I'm your husband.'

Health,"Lee W. Wattenberg, Who Saw Cancer Fighters in Foods, Dies at 92",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/19/health/lee-w-wattenberg-who-saw-cancer-fighters-in-foods-dies-at-92.html,", a medical researcher who helped jump-start the field of cancer prevention, finding weapons in the food people eat -- including chemical compounds in broccoli, cabbage, coffee and garlic -- died on Dec. 9 in Minneapolis. He was 92. The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, his daughter Elizabeth Wattenberg said. In 1966, Dr. Wattenberg published a landmark paper in the journal Cancer Research that reviewed 36 years of animal studies on the effects that certain compounds had on the development of cancer. The paper laid the framework for understanding how these compounds work. His interest was in helping to prevent cancer, and in a statement after his death, the American Association for Cancer Research called him the ""father of chemoprevention."" He was president of the association in 1992 and 1993. ""About two-thirds of all cancers are preventable,"" Margaret Foti, the association's current chief executive, said in the statement. ""Because of Lee Wattenberg's dedication to and belief in the promise of cancer prevention, the field has taken its rightful place as one of the most important areas of cancer research.""

Dr. Wattenberg, a professor at the University of Minnesota for 60 years, theorized that there are many thousands of chemicals that can inhibit cancer-causing compounds. These chemicals work by stimulating natural enzymes that the body uses to detoxify cancer-causing chemicals before they reach susceptible cells. If these invaders have already reached the cells, cancer-fighting chemicals can sometimes slow and even stop what might otherwise be an irreversible process. ""The story in the future will be in prevention,"" Dr. Wattenberg said in a 1996 interview with The Globe and Mail of Toronto. ""We would like to develop agents that hit early in the cancer process, to prevent the damage."" He found that the preservative known as B.H.A. (for butylated hydroxyanisole), an antioxidant used as a food additive, can block many carcinogens. He showed that cabbage, brussels sprouts, cauliflower and broccoli inhibit the development of carcinogens. He isolated a compound in garlic that decreased ""by a factor of three"" the chances that animals injected with cancer agents would develop that cancer. He found two chemicals in coffee that neutralize free radicals, which are harmful chemicals commonly implicated in the onset of cancer. A.A.C.R., the cancer research association, also credited Dr. Wattenberg with pioneering the use of aerosols to deliver drugs to cancer cells in the lungs. In 2000, when Dr. Hanspeter Witschi, a professor of toxicology at the University of California, Davis, reported finding nine chemicals that slow cancer, he pointed out that Dr. Wattenberg had laid the groundwork for finding two of them. ""He has been working in chemoprevention for 30 years or so,"" Dr. Witschi told The Globe and Mail, ""and he showed three or four years ago that you can prevent lung-tumor formation in mice.""

Much of the experimental work with chemicals that inhibit cancer has been limited to animals because of the problems inherent in infusing humans with substances whose effects over many years remain unknown. But the field has produced notable successes. One is tamoxifen, an estrogen-blocker sold under various brand names that reduces the risk of developing breast cancer. Not every attempt to thwart the onset of cancer has worked. Dr. Wattenberg told The New York Times in 1979 that carcinogen inhibitors could be unpredictable. Some may actually promote the action of certain carcinogens while blocking others. Timing, he said, was critical: The drug phenobarbital, for example, suppresses cancer when given before exposure to the carcinogen, but it fosters the development of cancer if administered after exposure. Dr. Wattenberg and others once hoped that beta carotene, a substance found in carrots, squash and other vegetables, would help prevent cancer. But in clinical trials, beta carotene was found to increase the risk of lung cancer. Similarly, vitamin E, a substance once thought to lower the risk of prostate cancer, may actually raise the risk. Lee Wolff Wattenberg was born in Manhattan on Dec. 22, 1921, and graduated from the City College of New York. His brother, Albert, a physicist who worked with Enrico Fermi on the first controlled release of nuclear energy, recruited Dr. Wattenberg to join the Manhattan Project as a junior biologist in its effort to develop the atomic bomb. He studied the effects of radiation on the body. The experience, he said, stimulated his interest in pursuing a career in scientific research. Dr. Wattenberg earned undergraduate and medical degrees from the University of Minnesota. During the Korean War, he served in the Army and was assigned to do research at what was then Walter Reed General Hospital in Washington. He then joined the University of Minnesota Medical School, where he did research until last year, producing more than 150 papers. He became a professor emeritus in 2005. Dr. Wattenberg received many honors, including in 1996 the A.A.C.R.-American Cancer Society Award for Outstanding Contributions to Cancer Prevention. Last year, the American Association for Cancer Research included him in its first class of fellows. In addition to his daughter Elizabeth, Dr. Wattenberg is survived by his wife of 70 years, the former Esther Ginsberg; another daughter, Anne Wattenberg; two sons, Mark and Binks; eight grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter. His son Richard and daughter Lynn Woolf died before him. Elizabeth Wattenberg said that her father had remained undaunted when one of his hypotheses did not pan out; he was always eager to try the next thing. She remembered him once asking his wife if he could dry a bushel of brussels sprouts in the clothes dryer to prepare them for experiments. She said yes.","Dr. Wattenberg, a University of Minnesota researcher hailed as the ""father of chemoprevention,"" found weapons in chemical compounds in broccoli, cabbage, coffee and garlic.",c1ec4c0a-8f71-54d6-b987-4e833f182d17,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/19/us/wattenberg-obit/wattenberg-obit-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2014&h=550&w=1050&s=a68ed5be77585508cf8c788d589a8a840df90053ea476232b04d5cae46d9d2cf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Dr. Lee W.

Media,"In Ending 'Roseanne,' ABC Executive Makes Her Voice Heard",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/business/media/channing-dungey-roseanne.html,"Channing Dungey had stayed out of the spotlight since taking over as the head of ABC Entertainment in 2016, but her decision to cancel ""Roseanne"" drew praise from people throughout Hollywood on Tuesday.

LOS ANGELES -- In the two years since Channing Dungey took over as president of ABC Entertainment, becoming the first black executive to run a major network, she had largely eschewed the spotlight, avoiding public comments whenever possible and preferring that her work speak for itself. She has certainly made her voice heard now. Ms. Dungey on Tuesday announced the firing of Roseanne Barr, one of ABC's most important stars, after the incendiary comedian posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett, a former top adviser to President Barack Obama. ""Roseanne's Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show,"" Ms. Dungey said in a statement. Ms. Dungey did not make the decision alone. Her boss, Ben Sherwood, president of the Disney-ABC Television Group, and his boss, Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, also backed the cancellation of ""Roseanne,"" which returned with monster ratings in March after concluding its initial run in 1997.

But it was striking that it was Ms. Dungey and not one of her superiors -- and not a network spokesman or spokeswoman, to whom such statements are often attributed -- who condemned Ms. Barr and declared the end of ""Roseanne."" Ms. Dungey, 49, became an instant celebrity, her name trending on Twitter as people rushed to express gratitude for her stand and holding her up as an example of why diversity in Hollywood's highest ranks is important. Stars like Viola Davis, who headlines the ABC drama ""How to Get Away With Murder,"" and Tony Goldwyn, who appeared on the ABC series ""Scandal,"" offered their applause. Krista Vernoff, an executive producer of ""Grey's Anatomy,"" the long-running ABC medical drama, said in a Twitter post, ""THANK YOU Channing Dungey for being my one little slice of hope for our country today.""

Ms. Dungey grew up in Sacramento -- her sister is the actress Merrin Dungey, known for her TV work on ""The King of Queens"" and ""Alias"" -- and graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, where she studied film and television. She got her start in Hollywood in the early 1990s, developing movie ideas at 20th Century Fox and then becoming a story editor for Steven Seagal's company, which was based at Warner Bros. Ms. Dungey soon became a Warner production executive, working on films like ""Twister,"" ""Space Jam"" and ""The Bridges of Madison County.""

She joined Disney in 2004 as an executive at what was then Touchstone Television, where she helped develop ""Criminal Minds"" for CBS and played a major role in the early production of ""Grey's Anatomy."" Her dogged advocacy for that medical drama, created by a then-unknown Shonda Rhimes, became an asset as Ms. Rhimes rose to prominence as one of Hollywood's most important show creators, with hits like ""Scandal"" and ""How to Get Away With Murder."" Along the way, Ms. Dungey won fans in Hollywood's broader creative community by delivering feedback in a manner that managed to be both blunt and compassionate. She also became known for a quiet resolve -- standing out by not joining other television executives in public grandstanding, even when she made history as the first black network president. ""I'm humbled by the great things that people have said,"" Ms. Dungey told The Los Angeles Times in 2016 when she replaced Paul Lee as ABC's chief. ""In terms of looking at this as maybe being a role model, I've always been very focused on being a role model for my daughter. And if I can inspire young women to pursue a career path in entertainment because of this, that would be a wonderful thing."" Ms. Dungey has encountered her share of difficulties -- some involving diversity -- since taking over as president of ABC Entertainment, a job that gives her oversight of prime-time and late-night programming, marketing and scheduling. She was criticized (along with Mr. Sherwood) for putting the rebooted ""Roseanne"" on the schedule in the first place, especially after the uproar over an episode's joke about the minority-led comedies ""black-ish"" and ""Fresh Off the Boat."" In a blow to ABC, Ms. Rhimes decamped to Netflix in August after the streaming service gave her a lucrative multiyear deal.

And ABC's relationship with another important minority show creator, Kenya Barris, has deteriorated in recent months. This year, ABC pulled an episode of his show, ""black-ish,"" that examined race relations in America in pointed fashion. During a conference call with reporters this month to discuss ABC's fall schedule, Ms. Dungey said the decision to pull the episode had been mutual. ""I think we all feel like that was the best decision over all,"" Ms. Dungey said. ABC and Mr. Barris may ultimately decide to part ways. He has been talking to Netflix about a deal of his own. But Mr. Barris was among those who took note of Ms. Dungey's censure of Ms. Barr. In tweeting a link about the cancellation of ""Roseanne,"" he said ""Bye-bye!!!"" and included Ms. Dungey's name and the emoji for gratitude.","Channing Dungey, who canceled the hit sitcom after its star's racist tweet, was held up as an example of why diversity in Hollywood's highest ranks is important.",5e6970de-2d00-58da-80f9-991cb32961c4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/30/business/30DUNGEY-print/30DUNGEY-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=732914d9950851edc51e124e58ca0552763852a9d2aecbda57cd81ba8c56a9b3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Channing Dungey had stayed out of the spotlight since taking over as the head of ABC Entertainment in 2016, but her decision to cancel &ldquo;Roseanne&rdquo; drew praise from people throughout Hollywood on Tuesday.",5e6970de-2d00-58da-80f9-991cb32961c4,N24News/imgs/5e6970de-2d00-58da-80f9-991cb32961c4.jpg,16
Travel,"Tracing Your Roots Through Travel, According to Mickela Mallozzi",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/17/travel/tracing-your-roots-through-travel-according-to-mickela-mallozzi.html,"The professional dancer Mickela Mallozzi woke with a jolt of an idea one night: She would create a television show where she would connect with people around the world through dance and music. Ms. Mallozzi had started traveling internationally while a student at New York University. Everywhere she went, she danced with locals. ""It was not 'let's come up with a gimmick for a TV show,' "" Ms. Mallozzi, 37, said. ""It's 'I love to travel this way, I think there's something behind this.' "" The first generation Italian-American used her savings to film the pilot episode in her family's hometown, Minturno, Italy, and the first season of ""Bare Feet"" aired nationally on PBS three years ago. Its third season, which premiered on NYC Life on June 6, will begin airing nationally on PBS stations in October. (Seasons 1 and 2 are available online at PBS.org or Amazon Prime.) Ms. Mallozzi looked to her own DNA for the new season. She determined her itineraries with results from four separate DNA tests, which revealed Greek, Middle Eastern and North African roots, among others. Viewers can follow along as she learns about la pizzica, an ancient dance form in Puglia, Italy, and dances Gnawa, a spiritual dance created by people who were enslaved in Morocco.

Ms. Mallozzi, who, when not traveling, splits her time between New York City and Nashville (her husband is a professional musician), recently spoke about the new season's theme, her travel philosophy and why she always packs an extra bag. Why is dance such a powerful way to connect? It's a universal language. I've been able to make friendships with people without verbally communicating with them. I make new friends by dancing with strangers. How did you come up with the idea for Season 3? The idea partly came from what's going on politically. There was so much ""America First."" Each one of us is made up of so many different cultures. Diversity is our biggest asset. There are so many similarities, people share the same basic needs: food, shelter, community, and dance and music to be happy. What is your goal of the show? I'm not seeking out living relatives. The goal of this new season, for me, was just to dance and feel the rhythms of places where someone in my distant past, or not so distant past, may have come from.

I want to inspire always through ""Bare Feet,"" to explore differently. Traveling doesn't mean you have to get on a plane, but I think it is necessary to connect with people who live there. The root word for travel comes from the French travailler, which means to work. I really want people to take a little inspiration from that to get out of their comfort zone.

How can non-dancers connect with people in other cultures? It's important to have genuine interest in something that is so important to someone else, whether that's food, whether that's dance, whether that's music, whether that's artisanship. If you find someone that loves something so deeply, and you are genuinely curious about it, they'll tell you more. As soon as I get on the plane, I set my clock to wherever I'm going. I never eat on the plane, because it may keep you up when you're supposed to be sleeping. I try to travel carry-on only, but I always pack Longchamp bags that fold up pretty small. When I do go to my destination, I do all this souvenir shopping -- I have a giant carry-on bag that just open s up, fill it up with all the goodies, and then I can check my bag on my way home. Please name a few must-see destinations for dance and music. The Republic of Georgia is amazing: the polyphonic singing -- it's this gorgeous, dissonant, beautiful singing -- the wine, the dances. We're doing two episodes in Ireland because there's so much traditional dance and music and it is such a part of every day lives.

Do you think we need to travel? I think we need travel in the right way. Just traveling, booking a ticket and staying in a luxury property separated from every form of reality, to me, isn't helping anybody. I have family who are immigrants themselves and who are descendants of immigrants who feel this anti-immigrant sentiment, and I think it's because they don't travel.

Why does that color photograph speak to you?

This is by Matthew Brandt. I found him in a small gallery on the Lower East Side, and I'm just totally drawn to his work. There was a picture of his grandmother developed in her own urine, but I didn't know that when I was looking at it. I happened to be in town when he was having his next opening. He photographs lakes and develops them in the water of the lake. It's so beautiful.

You just kind of sink into it. Why did you want a picture of a lake?

I'm a giant swimmer. I'm on the cusp of Pisces and Aries -- I have no earth in me, let me put it that way. This speaks to that, and there's a nostalgia to it that I find really magnetic. But it's also completely modern. The nostalgia is in the process as well as in the image, and that's what I really like. This is the biggest piece we have in the house and Jean-Marc was like, ""That's way too big; don't get it."" And then I did it [whispering] behind his back. He was like, ""O.K., it works."" But that one [pointing to a small painting on an adjacent wall] is more his size.

It's lovely and small. Who painted that?

This is Stephen Hannock, who is an old friend of mine. It's oil on wood, and it's the lights on Vietnamese fishing boats. I know him from my days at Hampshire College. He was at graduate school at Smith, and he played ultimate Frisbee at Hampshire College. I didn't have a thing about being a dancer. I hung out with visual artists.","Stephen Petronio's farmhouse is his private museum, with a focus on works from 1950 onward.",296c29cc-d6b6-5529-8566-27724a60e926,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/24/arts/24SHOWUSYOURWALL/24SHOWUSYOURWALL-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=e33d39bb96d10f72682e24a633f732f17669d9ef1e1a06089c062cb056358418&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Stephen Petronio says Matthew Brandt's photograph of a lake speaks to his love of swimming and his astrological connection to water.,296c29cc-d6b6-5529-8566-27724a60e926,N24News/imgs/296c29cc-d6b6-5529-8566-27724a60e926.jpg,6
Technology,"Microsoft Surface Pro X Review: Powerful Computer, but So-So Tablet",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/technology/personaltech/microsoft-surface-pro-x-review.html,"When Apple unveiled the iPad in 2010, Steve Jobs presented the tablet as a third device that we could carry along with a computer and smartphone. Years later, Microsoft responded with a radically different approach: It designed its Windows operating system to work on personal computers and tablets at the same time so that we could have both devices in one product. Microsoft's vision of a two-in-one tablet PC has now crystallized with the $1,000 Surface Pro X, which arrives in stores this week. The 13-inch tablet attaches to a keyboard to convert into a laptop. It is Microsoft's latest Surface to include a so-called ARM processor , a type of power-efficient chip used in many mobile devices, enabling apps to open more quickly and the battery to last longer. It also includes cellular connectivity to work with data plans offered by carriers like Verizon and AT&T.

The result is Microsoft's first tablet PC with the thinness, quietness, elongated battery life, snappy speeds and wireless capabilities of a smartphone or tablet. That's unlike past Surface products that felt more like PCs with touch screens. So it's progress. Yet after testing the Surface Pro X for several days, it did not feel fully baked -- especially as a tablet. There are many aspects of Windows that still feel uncomfortable to use with touch controls. Some important apps that people rely on for work have also not yet been programmed to work for this ARM-based computer, which could stifle productivity. I found this out by locking my laptop in my office desk drawer and relying on the Surface Pro X as my main computing device for several days while also testing Apple's iPad Pro, the product's main rival. In the end, I probably wouldn't replace my laptop with either device, for different reasons. Here's why.

The Surface Pro X is an elegant, well-designed product with highs and lows. Let's start with the positives. For one, battery life is excellent: Microsoft promises 13 hours of battery life, and I used the Surface Pro X for two days before needing to plug it in. The keyboard, which doubles as a protective cover for the screen, felt sturdy and nice to type on. It was not as tactile as a normal laptop keyboard, but close enough. The keyboard easily attached to the screen with strong magnets, and above the keys was a nifty cradle to hold and recharge the device's digital pen. Below the keys was a roomy trackpad for controlling the mouse. To me, the keyboard was the most important feature when it came to getting work done on a PC, and this was where the Surface Pro X excelled.

My gushing stopped as soon as the keyboard came off. In tablet mode, the Surface Pro X was awkward to use. It felt heavy to hold in one hand -- the bulk comes, in part, from a metal flap on the back of the device, which can be unfolded to make the screen stand upright. The software was the biggest problem. When you use the device as a tablet, Windows doesn't properly adapt to become a touchable operating system. Important elements, like the search icon or ""X"" button to close windows, remained tiny and difficult to tap with a fingertip. Web browser tabs appeared to be jammed into the top of the screen.

At heart, while Windows was designed to be a two-in-one experience, it is still a PC operating system with some flawed tablet features. Microsoft said that it had heard feedback from people on the Windows interface and that it was continuing to improve its software for tablet use. Another downside is that some important apps were not compatible with this ARM-based computer. Dropbox, the online storage service that I rely on every day for work, doesn't fully function on the Surface Pro X. Adobe was still working to make some of its creativity apps, like Photoshop, work with this special version of Windows. The device does work well, however, with Office 365, Microsoft's cloud-based versions of Microsoft Word, PowerPoint and Excel. How will you know which of your apps will work with the Surface Pro X? There's no simple method short of doing a web search on app compatibility with this product. Microsoft said it offered a tool to help people choose a Surface device based on their lifestyle and the type of work they do. For example, the tool steers creative users who rely on Adobe apps toward the Surface Book 2 and the Surface Pro 7, which can run a broader set of apps because of their PC chip architecture. The closest competitor to the Surface Pro X is the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, the premium version of Apple's tablet that works with optional styluses and keyboards. To make comparisons, I tested an iPad Pro with Apple's Smart Keyboard and the Apple Pencil. As a tablet, the iPad Pro was superior to the Surface Pro X's tablet mode in every way. The iPad Pro's body was more comfortable to hold. The software system was designed to work with your fingertips: App icons were nice and large, and swipe gestures acted as shortcuts to close apps and return to the home screen. The Apple Pencil magnetized to the side of the iPad, which replenished the pen's power.

But Apple's Smart Keyboard, which attached to the tablet with magnets, felt inferior to the Surface Pro X's keyboard. It was light and thin, which made typing on the keys feel flimsy. Fortunately, there were plenty of third-party iPad Pro keyboards that were bulkier but felt more like normal keyboards. One other note: I have owned an older iPad Pro for several years, but it has never come close to replacing my laptop. Other than my neuroses about keyboards, the deal-breaker was the multitasking interface. I just can't get the hang of juggling several apps on an iPad when doing work; I'd rather toggle between multiple windows on a computer using a mouse and keyboard. Over all, the Surface Pro X is a neat product. In the coming years, we can expect more PCs to adopt mobile computing processors and the strengths of our smartphones and tablets. The Surface Pro will appeal mostly to those who want to live on the bleeding edge of tech. But for everyone else, there's no rush to buy. The device will be more mature once Microsoft improves Windows to be better suited for tablet use. It will also be a safer purchase after more staple apps are guaranteed to work with the device. At $1,000, the Surface Pro X is expensive. The keyboard and stylus, which are must-buys to get the most out of this tablet, drive the price up to $1,270. For that much money, you could get a great laptop and a separate tablet. For most people, that's probably still the way to go. At home with the Surface Pro and iPad Pro, I ultimately found myself wanting to reach for the iPad Pro more often to check email, browse the web and watch videos. When it came to work tasks, I yearned for a normal computer. That was abundantly clear when I faced a tight deadline for writing this review of the Surface Pro. Instead of using the Surface to type this out, I returned to the office to write on a PC.","With its new Surface, Microsoft has made progress blending the best of mobile devices and personal computers. But it falls short in offering a fingertip-friendly experience for tablets.",e3784281-328d-5c7b-a21f-f39005c62e6d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/05/business/05techfix1/merlin_163856385_2f33e79a-f6cf-4da8-af3e-def4486676aa-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=fe2012c1021d8e37a82c2f1876c25aa43a10fba2684a06d2a5a0426f5fec5d0e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The new Microsoft Surface Pro X.,e3784281-328d-5c7b-a21f-f39005c62e6d,N24News/imgs/e3784281-328d-5c7b-a21f-f39005c62e6d.jpg,20
Books,Graphic Novels With Fresh Voices From the Margins,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/books/review/hot-comb-ebony-flowers-dear-scarlet-teresa-wong.html,"The field of comics today offers many different kinds of stories -- including a rich range of fantasy titles, and even an ""Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Freshman Force"" comic book -- and also many different kinds of creators, including cartoonists who came to comics late, or unexpectedly, and now, as minority voices, are joining the ranks to establish new traditions. Ebony Flowers is an African-American education researcher who composed her Ph.D. dissertation, in 2017, largely in comics form. Teresa Wong is a second-generation Chinese-Canadian writer -- and a copywriter at a digital marketing agency -- whose author's bio relates, in its first lines, that she ""had three children in less than five years."" Five years ago, I bet, neither of these women, pursuing other careers, thought they would be doing comics. Both have just published slim but powerful debuts -- respectively, a short story collection, HOT COMB (Drawn & Quarterly, $21.95), and a memoir addressed to a firstborn child, DEAR SCARLET: The Story of My Postpartum Depression (Arsenal Pulp Press, $17.95). They center on female embodiment as well as the ways that race and gender can shape how we form our identities. Both explore, in accessible black and white, the everyday experience of feeling like an other, making that feeling -- whether in relation to one's peers or one's own offspring -- vivid and resonant on the page.

In the eight stories of ""Hot Comb,"" a mix of autobiography and fiction, the thread throughout is black women's hair -- as a source of intimacy, community and tension. The title story, at 41 pages, is the most successful: It tells of Ebony's first perm -- in which her natural hair is chemically relaxed -- at age 11, for which she and her reluctant mother visit Dee's Salon, on Baltimore's East Side. It's hard to argue with her reasoning; when her mother protests she's too young, she replies earnestly, ""Sssorry ... I'm tired of people making fun of me and beating me up."" Flowers goes deep into the context for this fraught mother-daughter outing, which includes her parents' earlier decision to move out of a mixed-race trailer park in Maryland because they think their kids are acting too white.

Ebony's hardworking mother attends to her daughter's hair, straightening it at home with a heated iron comb. In one touching early scene, Flowers draws her mother in a tier-wide panel in ""after work wear."" Her shirt and bra are off, her ""work wig"" sits next to her, and she's sipping Bacardi on the couch, a portrait of exhaustion. Yet when Ebony asks, ""Can you press my hair for the talent show?,"" a three-hour endeavor, her mom simply replies, ""Sure, baby."" Here we see the complexity around her hairstyle and its implications: The straightening of her hair is both a loving form of care and something -- when it's a perm -- that makes her mother cry. What moves us, in turn, is the artist's own attention to meticulous visual detail in her comics, charting the steps of the hair care process, a replication of her mother's effort. Between her stories, showing off her sly humor and ethnographer's eye, Flowers intersperses faux advertisements for hair care products from her fictional ""Pinnacle"" line, such as Hair Decoded, Kinky Mane (slogan: ""It Is Known"") and Kids n' Koils.","In her Graphic Content column, Hillary Chute looks at ""Hot Comb,"" by Ebony Flowers, and ""Dear Scarlet,"" by Teresa Wong — slim but powerful debuts.",1632348c-0cf5-5491-9654-c153aeb5777b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/28/books/review/Flowers2/Flowers2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=462b546ce6a151afacc49f9ae7dce3614801a2afb03a1b90168008e303b88e3b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From ""Hot Comb.""",1632348c-0cf5-5491-9654-c153aeb5777b,N24News/imgs/1632348c-0cf5-5491-9654-c153aeb5777b.jpg,13
Theater,"Review: What's a Woman's Role? All of 'Em, 'Bernhardt/Hamlet' Argues",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/25/theater/bernhardt-hamlet-review.html,"Is it chance or synchronicity that brings ""Bernhardt/Hamlet,"" a muscular comedy about a woman unbound, to Broadway at this grim transitional moment in gender politics? Either way, Theresa Rebeck's new play, which opened on Tuesday at the American Airlines Theater, is so clever it uplifts, so timely it hurts. That's a depressing thing to say about a story set in 1899 in that temple of chauvinism, the French popular theater. Janet McTeer stars as Sarah Bernhardt, then in her mid-50s and aging out of the dying courtesan roles that made her world-famous. As far as Shakespeare is concerned, she is caught in the gap between Ophelia and Gertrude. Enter the men: Edmond Rostand (Jason Butler Harner), one of France's greatest young dramatists; Alphonse Mucha (Matthew Saldivar), the Art Nouveau illustrator of Bernhardt's gorgeous posters; and Louis (Tony Carlin), a critic so parsimonious with praise I suppose it's only fair that he's given no surname.

""A woman with power,"" he says of Bernhardt, and right to her face, ""is a freak."" It is not just the assumption of male opportunities and prerogatives that bothers these men; to be fair, Rostand, whom Ms. Rebeck posits as Bernhardt's lover, is actually turned on by her Hamlet boots. ""It is delightful to undress a man and find a woman inside,"" he says, undoing her drag after rehearsal.

To which Bernhardt responds, with the hungry air of the often disappointed, ""It is equally delightful to undress a man and find a man."" Though Ms. Rebeck sees herself as a storyteller and not a polemicist, this exchange typifies her knack for jokes that score points. The gender crisis even then, ""Bernhardt/Hamlet"" suggests, was not about femaleness but maleness. What's wrong with men that they can't tolerate strong women?

From there it's barely a step to an even more taboo question: What's wrong with Shakespeare? In letting Bernhardt dissect Hamlet in rehearsal -- to ask why, undressing him, she never finds a man -- the play locates a marvelous side door to its subject. Hamlet, after all, is all words. Beautiful ones, yes: But untethered to meaningful action, what is the value of beauty? That's precisely the box that Bernhardt -- who knew from boxes because she sometimes slept in a coffin -- feels trapped in by her gender. And so she hits upon the brilliantly perverse idea of having Rostand rewrite Shakespeare to eliminate the poetry. Until that point, ""Bernhardt/Hamlet,"" a deluxe Roundabout Theater Company production, is breakneck backstage comedy, swiveling like its Lazy Susan of a set (by Beowulf Boritt) among scenes of romance, Rialto gossip, rehearsal drollery and literary exploration. (Thesis topic: How old is Hamlet?) Bernhardt makes the persuasive case that men who are youthful enough to play the role are too inexperienced and men who are experienced enough are too unyouthful. A boyish woman is the only sensible solution. In these scenes, Ms. McTeer, best known on Broadway for playing Nora Helmer and Mary Stuart, turns her tragic intensity inside out. Trying on emotions as if they were samples at a perfume counter, she flits through moods both pungent and evanescent. Dudgeon quickly melts to delight and narcissism to apology. She hardly needs Rostand, Louis or Mucha to define her; she is author, critic and self-portraitist in one.

That's rare enough in plays about strong women. Rarer yet, as Bernhardt locates the heart of Hamlet Ms. McTeer the comedian becomes a riveting Shakespearean, exploring new pathways through scenes with the ghost and with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Suddenly you want to see Bernhardt -- or Ms. McTeer -- as everyone in the canon. But in the second act, after the big decision, the play loses some of its internal logic. Not because it departs from history; Bernhardt did commission and eventually triumph in an adaptation of ""Hamlet,"" if not by Rostand. And Ms. Rebeck's confidence as a storyteller in any case moots the historical infidelities that mar so many period pieces. Her tale has its own inevitability and that is enough. Instead, the problem with the second half of the play is that it fritters its focus on a new set of concerns, including Rostand's wife, Rosamond (Ito Aghayere); his new play ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" (which actually had its premiere in 1897); and Bernhardt's adult son, Maurice (Nick Westrate). Ms. Rebeck writes about all of these with her usual verve, and her analysis of ""Cyrano"" is devastating. It's just that we cannot now invest ourselves in developments that seem to lead away from, instead of toward, the character we care most about. But with great effort Ms. Rebeck does eventually bend this all back to Bernhardt. (She has devised one of the most thrilling endings I've seen in years.) And perhaps the time away was useful to the extent that we now see the character less in the context of her own personal quest and more in the context of the play's central question: ""Is the female self exposed the same as the male self exposed?"" We still don't know the answer to that, but if we're going to find out, the stage is a good place to start. And the exceptional thing about Ms. Rebeck's no-excuses attack on the matter is that she models this as a question in which men, too, must be vividly involved. In that sense, ""Bernhardt/Hamlet,"" directed with wit and verve by Moritz von Stuelpnagel, is a deep-inside love letter to the theater as a kind of laboratory in which experiments in both art and equality are possible. Among all her supposed fans and supporters, it is only Bernhardt's company of actors, led by the old-school Constant Coqueline (Dylan Baker, great), who fully support her gender daring. Even the ingenue (Brittany Bradford) quite happily experiments with full-on Hamlet-Ophelia frottage.",Janet McTeer plays Sarah Bernhardt as the Prince of Denmark in Theresa Rebeck's muscular new play about gender limitation and possibility.,3424ce7d-1e9b-57c6-a796-0609f12a7952,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/arts/26bernhardthamlet1/26bernhardthamlet1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=a1838c0bad3322253a9f419bb276991a30ac7fd3a2c73ddaa992e3b989dfca66&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Janet McTeer as the famed actress Sarah Bernhardt in the Roundabout Theater Company production of Theresa Rebeck's play.,3424ce7d-1e9b-57c6-a796-0609f12a7952,N24News/imgs/3424ce7d-1e9b-57c6-a796-0609f12a7952.jpg,10
Technology,Clinical Trials Hit by Ransomware Attack on Health Tech Firm,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/03/technology/clinical-trials-ransomware-attack-drugmakers.html,"A Philadelphia company that sells software used in hundreds of clinical trials, including the crash effort to develop tests, treatments and a vaccine for the coronavirus, was hit by a ransomware attack that has slowed some of those trials over the past two weeks. The attack on eResearchTechnology, which has not previously been reported, began two weeks ago when employees discovered that they were locked out of their data by ransomware, an attack that holds victims' data hostage until they pay to unlock it. ERT said clinical trial patients were never at risk, but customers said the attack forced trial researchers to track their patients with pen and paper. Among those hit were IQVIA, the contract research organization helping manage AstraZeneca's Covid vaccine trial, and Bristol Myers Squibb, the drugmaker leading a consortium of companies to develop a quick test for the virus. ERT has not said how many clinical trials were affected, but its software is used in drug trials across Europe, Asia and North America. It was used in three-quarters of trials that led to drug approvals by the Food and Drug Administration last year, according to its website.

On Friday, Drew Bustos, ERT's vice president of marketing, confirmed that ransomware had seized its systems on Sept. 20. As a precaution, Mr. Bustos said, the company took its systems offline that day, called in outside cybersecurity experts and notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation. ""Nobody feels great about these experiences, but this has been contained,"" Mr. Bustos said. He added that ERT was starting to bring its systems back online on Friday and planned to bring remaining systems online over the coming days. Mr. Bustos said it was still too early to say who was behind the attack. He declined to say whether the company paid its extortionists, as so many companies hit by ransomware now do. The attack on ERT follows another major ransomware attack last weekend on Universal Health Services, a major hospital chain with more than 400 locations, many in the United States. NBC News first reported the attack on UHS on Monday, and said it appeared to be ""one of the largest medical cyberattacks in United States history.""

The incidents followed more than a thousand ransomware attacks on American cities, counties and hospitals over the past 18 months. The attacks, once treated as a nuisance, have taken on greater urgency in recent weeks as American officials worry they may interfere, directly or indirectly, with the November election.
* Who should get a booster shot? It depends, Dr. Scott Gottlieb says. A ransomware attack in Germany resulted in the first known death from a cyberattack in recent weeks, after Russian hackers seized 30 servers at University Hospital Dusseldorf, crashing systems and forcing the hospital to turn away emergency patients. As a result, the German authorities said, a woman in a life-threatening condition was sent to a hospital 20 miles away in Wuppertal and died from treatment delays. One of ERT's clients, IQVIA, said it had been able to limit problems because it had backed up its data. Bristol Myers Squibb also said the impact of the attack had been limited, but other ERT customers had to move their clinical trials to pen and paper. In a statement, IQVIA said the attack had ""had limited impact on our clinical trials operations,"" and added, ""We are not aware of any confidential data or patient information, related to our clinical trial activities, that have been removed, compromised or stolen."" Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, two companies working on a coronavirus vaccine, said their coronavirus vaccine trials had not been affected. ""ERT is not a technology provider for or otherwise involved in Pfizer's Phase 1/2/3 Covid-19 vaccine clinical trials,"" Amy Rose, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said. Companies and research labs on the front lines of the pandemic have been repeat targets for foreign hackers over the past seven months, as countries around the world try to gauge one another's responses and progress in addressing the virus. In May, the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security warned that Chinese government spies were actively trying to steal American clinical research through cybertheft.","No patients were affected, but the incident was another reminder of the risks in the increasingly common assaults on computer networks.",13fde4d7-db7a-5571-87a1-1a5017abb475,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/05/business/03erthack-print/03erthack-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=142c2bf245db7f7692c0384deb230eb0f931f4fa6e9bcc4dd38cb5b56186fffc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"IQVIA, the contract research organization helping manage AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine trial, was one of the victims of the attack.

Music,"Ellis Marsalis, Jazz Pianist and Music Family Patriarch, Dies at 85",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/arts/music/ellis-marsalis-dead-virus.html,"This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others here. Ellis Marsalis, a pianist and educator who became the guiding force behind a late-20th-century resurgence in jazz while putting four musician sons on a path to prominent careers, died on Wednesday in New Orleans. He was 85. The cause was complications of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, his son Branford said in a statement. Mr. Marsalis spent decades as a working musician and teacher in New Orleans before his eldest sons, Wynton and Branford, gained national fame in the early 1980s embodying a fresh-faced revival of traditional jazz.

Mr. Marsalis's star rose along with theirs, and he, too, became a household name. ""Ellis Marsalis was a legend,"" Mayor LaToya Cantrell of New Orleans wrote on Twitter on Wednesday night. ""He was the prototype of what we mean when we talk about New Orleans jazz."" That was not always so. Mr. Marsalis's devotion to midcentury bebop and its offshoots had long made him something of an outsider in a city with an abiding loyalty to its early-jazz roots. Still, he secured the respect of fellow musicians thanks to his unshakable talents as a pianist and composer, and his supportive but rigorous manner as an educator. Once they reached the national stage, the Marsalises' advocacy of straight-ahead jazz made them renegades of a different sort. Wynton, a trumpeter, boldly espoused his father's devotion to heroes like Charlie Parker and Thelonious Monk, and he issued public broadsides against the slicker jazz-rock fusion that had largely displaced acoustic jazz during the late 1960s and '70s.

""My dad was a giant of a musician and teacher, but an even greater father,"" Branford Marsalis said in a statement. ""He poured everything he had into making us the best of what we could be."" In an acknowledgment of the patriarch's influence as well as his own talents, the National Endowment for the Arts in 2011 named Mr. Marsalis and his musician sons Jazz Masters. It is considered the highest honor for an American jazz musician, and until then it had been awarded only on an individual basis. By that point, the Marsalises were widely understood to be jazz's royal family. Wynton had become the founding artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center in New York, the world's pre-eminent nonprofit organization devoted to jazz, and he won the Pulitzer Prize for music in 1997. Branford was a world-renowned saxophonist and bandleader with three Grammys to his name. Mr. Marsalis's two other musician sons, Delfeayo, a trombonist, and Jason, a drummer and vibraphonist, were well established as bandleaders.

""My father never put pressure on me."" he said. ""He's too cool for that kind of stuff."" Asked to define his father's brand of cool, he explained: ""The house could fall down and everyone would be running around, and he would still be sitting in his same chair."" Ellis Louis Marsalis Jr. was born in New Orleans on Nov. 14, 1934. His mother, Florence (Robertson) Marsalis, was a homemaker. His father owned the Marsalis Motel in suburban New Orleans and was involved in the civil rights movement. The motel's guests included the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr. of New York, the future Supreme Court justice Thurgood Marshall and Ray Charles. Mr. Marsalis started out as a saxophonist before switching to the piano in high school. He earned his bachelor's degree in music education from Dillard University in New Orleans in 1955 and taught at Xavier University Preparatory School until enlisting in the Marine Corps in the late 1950s. There he became a member of the Corps Four, a quartet of Marines that performed jazz on television and radio to aid in recruitment. After leaving the Marines he taught briefly in Breaux Bridge, La., then returned to New Orleans with Dolores and their four children to work at his father's motel while playing shows at night. Mr. Marsalis performed and recorded throughout the 1960s and '70s with a variety of modern and progressive jazz musicians, including the drummer Ed Blackwell and the eminent horn-playing brothers Cannonball and Nat Adderley. He later earned a master's degree in music education from Loyola University in New Orleans and led the jazz studies program at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts for high school students. It was there that he mentored such future stars as Mr. Blanchard and Mr. Connick as well as his own children.

Reviewing a 1979 performance by Mr. Marsalis at the Carnegie Tavern in New York just before his family burst onto the national stage, John S. Wilson of The New York Times introduced him to his readers. ""Unlike the widely accepted image of jazz musicians from New Orleans, Mr. Marsalis is not a traditionalist,"" Mr. Wilson wrote, describing him as ""an eclectic performer with a light and graceful touch"" and an ""exploratory turn of mind."" Four years later, Mr. Marsalis made another New York appearance, at a next-door locale with a similar name: Carnegie Hall. There he gave a solo concert, oscillating between original compositions and jazz standards. ""Mr. Marsalis's interpretations were impressive in their economy and steadiness,"" the Times critic Stephen Holden wrote. ""Sticking mainly to the middle register of the keyboard, the pianist offered richly harmonized arrangements in which fancy keyboard work was kept to a minimum and studious melodic invention, rather than pronounced bass patterns, determined the structures and tempos."" Before Wynton and then Branford found acclaim, Mr. Marsalis had recorded only sporadically. But once they all became nationally known, that changed.

Theater,'Measure for Measure' Review: No One Is Innocent on Mardi Gras,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/02/theater/measure-for-measure-review.html,"With their two productions this season, the folks at the Public Theater's Mobile Unit, a touring company that offers free shows in communities all around New York City, have proved what they know how to do better than anyone else. It's not creating a dynamic dialogue between the works onstage and the audience, although they're wizards at it. It's not making Shakespeare feel urgent and fresh by turning the plays on their head, although I can't think of any other company that has made me want to sit through ""The Tempest"" twice.

Where they excel, in miraculous ways, is in finding solutions to the Bard's ""problem plays."" In ""Measure for Measure,"" running at the Shiva Theater through Dec. 8, they have taken the icky plot about a greedy Duke trying to coerce a novice into sleeping with him, and transposed it to recent history, creating a more believable frame for the play's themes of amorality arising from hedonism.

The director LA Williams has set the action in New Orleans in 1979, on the Fat Tuesday when a police strike led authorities to threaten citizens with the cancellation of Mardi Gras. The mayor, the appropriately named Ernest Morial , asked people to stay home and sit this one out.

But of course he couldn't stop the holiday, and although some parades were axed , the people flooded the streets to celebrate anyway.","Morals are especially relative in a new production of Shakespeare's play, set in New Orleans amid the anarchy of Fat Tuesday, 1979.",88a75fc4-b55e-5f98-a026-e1814446a85c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/04/arts/00measure/merlin_164852217_8e09be25-5b9c-4986-bd48-7375489420b4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=431322665a7a22f67af007373c36c42f943f8f496ae871bf99f6ab9c548072da&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The company of The Public Theater&rsquo;s Mobile Unit in &ldquo;Measure for Measure,&rdquo; which is playing at the Public Theater following a tour of New York&rsquo;s five boroughs.",88a75fc4-b55e-5f98-a026-e1814446a85c,N24News/imgs/88a75fc4-b55e-5f98-a026-e1814446a85c.jpg,10
Real Estate,"For Now, a Studio Near Madison Square Park",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/realestate/for-now-a-studionearmadison-square-park.html,"After his graduation from the University of Delaware in 2012, Steven Rollino moved back home with his parents on Long Island, N.Y. He commuted to work in Manhattan via the Long Island Rail Road. Between the hour-long train ride and the legs on either end, the trip took him more than two hours each way. Weary of the commute, Mr. Rollino, a salesman in the information technology field, decided to team up with two friends to rent a place. Their plan soon stalled. ""I didn't really have control,"" Mr. Rollino said. ""My friends were dragging their feet."" About a year ago, he and his parents, Mark and Rosemarie Rollino, decided to buy a starter apartment together. The idea was that it would be an investment property, to be rented out ""once I get married, have a family and all that, if I move out to the suburbs like everybody,"" said Mr. Rollino, 26, the eldest of five siblings. ""We always had that investment piece in our mind.""

One of the first buildings the three liked was a co-op north of Madison Square Park. A large one-bedroom there, for $595,000 with monthly maintenance in the low $1,400s, was being sold by an architect. The building allowed unlimited renting after two years of ownership. But the apartment, which had been redone with a spartan modern aesthetic, was so individual that ""it would never be my place -- it would always be that other person's place,"" Mr. Rollino said. They moved on, and the unit sold for $640,000. Mr. Rollino and his parents also liked a large one-bedroom in a 1938 co-op building, this one in the Flatiron district, slightly south of Madison Square Park, for $549,000, with monthly maintenance in the mid-$600s. (The regular maintenance fee was almost $1,000 a month, but a three-year rebate was in effect.)

The apartment, on the ground floor, was in the back of the building, so it was away from foot traffic. The family's offer of slightly over the asking price was accepted. To their surprise, another buyer swooped in with a much higher offer -- a practice sometimes known as ""gazumping."" The Rollinos declined to counteroffer. The apartment sold for $590,000. The learning curve about the Manhattan market was steep, Mr. Rollino's father said. ""The apartment is listed under the actual value to draw people in and to draw the prices way over asking,"" he said. ""I realized the strategy is to make everybody fight over it. Once you understand the game, then you know how to play it.""

The Rollinos visited an appealing one-bedroom in a small elevator co-op building near Stuyvesant Square. The price was $529,000, with monthly maintenance in the low $1,300s. The kitchen, however, was ""a funnel-type kitchen,"" Mr. Rollino said, with a strange triangular shape. ""When you have to turn sideways to open your oven, perhaps we should think, 'Wait a minute,' "" Ms. Lindorme said. That one sold for the asking price. After nearly a year, despite many weekend apartment visits, the Rollinos were still empty-handed. ""The coolest part is you don't know what's behind the door,"" Mr. Rollino said. He was always eager to see -- and always surprised at -- ""how much bigger these photographers can make these apartments look.""

But the hunt, initially interesting, was growing tiresome. Mr. Rollino thought they might have better luck if they focused on studios instead of one-bedrooms. A studio surfaced in the building the Rollinos had originally liked, the one north of Madison Square Park. The apartment, sectioned off with a large bookcase, was being rented out and seemed cluttered. But Mr. Rollino loved the space, a rectangular room with a walk-in closet and a dressing area. The asking price was $420,000, with monthly maintenance in the high $800s. ""Sometimes going down in price makes things a better find,"" Ms. Lindorme said. The Rollinos went back several times. ""I knew that once we got the big bulky bookcase out of there, the whole place would open up,"" Mr. Rollino said. ""When we changed our mind-set from looking for a one-bedroom to a studio, all the stars aligned.""",Steven Rollino knew he might outgrow his first home. So rental potential was important.,71f5936a-bd41-594b-b577-cd720fdc4b01,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/06/realestate/06HUNT-MAIN/06HUNT-MAIN-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=663d831e66b72ae408d263cd8b30f2a65e58f03d2365e7abb6a8ca4fec93a71f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,THE BUYER Steven Rollino in the kitchen of his studio apartment.,71f5936a-bd41-594b-b577-cd720fdc4b01,N24News/imgs/71f5936a-bd41-594b-b577-cd720fdc4b01.jpg,7
Opinion,Trump Is Plotting Against the Census. Here's Why.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/opinion/trump-census-2020.html,"The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values . It is separate from the newsroom.





The Census Bureau hasn't offered a clear explanation for its decision this week to bring an early end to the decennial enumeration of the nation's population, but the reason is clear enough: The Trump administration doesn't want a complete count, as the law requires. This is not a secret plot. Mr. Trump has been trying to whitewash the census since the moment he took office. First his administration tried to add a question about citizenship in an effort to depress the response rate of noncitizens. As one longtime Republican strategist concluded in a 2015 analysis, excluding noncitizens from the census would ""be advantageous to Republicans and non-Hispanic whites."" After the Supreme Court poured cold water on that plan last year, Mr. Trump directed the government last month not to count undocumented immigrants for the purposes of reapportioning seats in the House of Representatives. (That's almost certainly unconstitutional.) The latest gambit is broader: Ending the crucial in-person canvass one month early will ensure a significant undercount of minorities, as well as rural populations and other groups. Even in the best of times, counting roughly 330 million people is a monumental task. In the midst of a pandemic, it becomes incalculably harder. The bureau anticipated this back in April, during the first wave of the coronavirus, when it requested from Congress a four-month extension to deliver its data. Current federal law requires the data to be turned in by Dec. 31; the extension would have run through April 2021. As part of its request, the bureau said it would continue knocking on doors, trying to reach every person in the country, through the end of October.

The House of Representatives approved that request in May; the Senate has not acted on it. Instead of pressing harder, the census director, Steven Dillingham, said Monday that door-to-door data collection would end September 30, a month earlier than previously planned, to meet the Dec. 31 deadline. ""We are committed to a complete and accurate 2020 census,"" Mr. Dillingham said. It's hard to see how. Just last month, the census's associate director, Albert Fontenot Jr., said, ""we are past the window of being able to get those counts"" by the end of the year. Why does an accurate and complete census matter? Because it is the anchor of representative democracy. The Constitution's framers made a national head count the first job of the federal government for a reason. Based on this count, we make some of our most consequential decisions as a society, from the states' representation in Congress to the distribution of more than $1.5 trillion in annual funding for a wide range of public programs. Businesses rely on the data to plan investments. School districts rely on it to decide how many teachers they need. Researchers use it to analyze the patterns of American life. The financial ramifications of any mistakes in the census count for state and local governments are particularly significant. Research by Andrew Reamer, a professor at George Washington University, provides a partial picture of the impact of undercounting. For each person missed by the 2010 census, he calculates that in the 2015 fiscal year, that person's state lost about $1,091 in federal funding for Medicaid and child welfare programs. Those programs comprise just a quarter of federal funding tied to the census. That's why it is essential for the census to be as precise and as comprehensive as possible. ""Like the military, the census, the nation's largest peacetime mobilization, cannot fail,"" a former Census Bureau director wrote in The New York Times this year. ""The stakes are too high, its numbers too consequential.""

To date, just under 63 percent of American households have responded to the census. In normal years, census workers would knock on as many doors as possible from the other 37 percent of homes, many in poorer and rural areas of the country. The arrival of the pandemic, only weeks before the start of the count on April 1, disrupted those plans. Census officials were hoping that the virus would fade by now, allowing for more in-person data collection. But the outbreak hasn't abated, and could get even worse this fall when the traditional flu season begins. Add to that the many Americans who have been displaced by the virus, either temporarily or permanently, and you have the ingredients for a major distortion in the count. The president ought to do everything in his power to ameliorate that distortion. Instead, Mr. Trump and his Republican allies have repeatedly tried to exacerbate it. By their calculations, the fewer people of color and noncitizens who are counted, the better. It's true that people of color, who are more likely to be poor or marginalized than white people, are less likely to be counted in the census, perhaps more so this year than in decades. But the irony is that a rush to finish the counting process could hurt Mr. Trump's own voters, too. That's because the poorest states, which depend the most on federal funding, also tend to have lower census response rates. In West Virginia, federal funding from programs tied to the census accounted for 17 percent of economic activity in 2017, according to Mr. Reamer's calculations. The state has one of the lowest census response rates. And because so much federal funding is allocated to states based at least in part on census population estimates, an inaccurate census doesn't just harm people in undercounted communities. It harms everyone who lives in the same state. Whatever happens in the election, the effects of the census will be with the country for at least another decade -- a legacy that will long outlive this administration. Congress can intervene. The deadline for delivery of the final count needs to be extended to April 30, 2021, as the Census Bureau initially requested. That would force states to delay the process of drawing new legislative maps, and in some cases could make it impossible to meet deadlines written into state law. But the necessary adjustments are a small price to pay for 10 years of a fairer and more accurate democracy. Four former census directors, from Democratic and Republican administrations, called in a statement this week for Congress to commission outside experts to establish criteria for evaluating the accuracy of the final count. That's a good idea, too.","By his calculations, the fewer people of color and noncitizens who are counted, the better.",8415072f-dff6-57cc-9af6-1e7397bd370c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/08/opinion/08census/05census-facebookJumbo-v6.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=6928e70ce4d561c9bf5729ab855029b73f443729177211eaf5d897483df4a475&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,,8415072f-dff6-57cc-9af6-1e7397bd370c,N24News/imgs/8415072f-dff6-57cc-9af6-1e7397bd370c.jpg,11
Science,How Line-Dried Laundry Gets That Fresh Smell,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/science/laundry-smell-line.html,"People have written poems about it. It has been imitated by candles and air fresheners. At least one person has even fought in court for the right to produce it naturally.

Some atmospheric chemists like that scent, too. In a paper published this year in Environmental Chemistry, researchers examined line-dried towels at the molecular level, to try to pinpoint the source of their specific fragrance.

Silvia Pugliese led the research while she was a master's student at the University of Copenhagen. When Ms. Pugliese was a child, her mother line-dried laundry, and she still does it whenever she can.

""The fresh smell reminds me of home,"" she said. So she was excited to rigorously pursue such an everyday research subject.",This is what happens when atmospheric chemists hang towels on drying racks around their chemistry building.,0a193951-440d-590d-a66f-e35e1cfed3c0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/09/science/29TB-LAUNDRY/29TB-LAUNDRY-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=64e6f50e74092a60d40bdfa358cc723e3540089f489cde47498b24617fe8e333&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Laundry drying on Lake Attersee in Austria.,0a193951-440d-590d-a66f-e35e1cfed3c0,N24News/imgs/0a193951-440d-590d-a66f-e35e1cfed3c0.jpg,2
Theater,Theater Kids Trade a Big Stage for Highlight Tapes and Heartache,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/theater/virtual-international-thespian-festival.html,"Brooke Watts and Carson Palmer played Cassie and Mike in the production of ""A Chorus Line"" by the Northwest School of the Arts in Charlotte, N.C., which couldn't be presented at the International Thespian Festival because of the coronavirus.





On the evening of the first Friday this month, in a tiny town in a rural Kansas county where you could have tallied the coronavirus cases on two hands and had fingers left over, Leslie Coats headed to the high school where she has taught drama for more than 40 years. School has been out since before Memorial Day, but one of her students wanted help preparing for a college audition. Afterward, he asked if they could go into the theater, where he hadn't been since classes went virtual back in March. Inside, he looked around at the familiar space, where the frame of a familiar set -- for Arthur Miller's ""All My Sons"" -- was already back onstage. ""He said, 'I feel like a huge weight just lifted off my shoulders,'"" Coats recalled by phone the next morning, her voice thickening in sympathy. ""And then he started crying.""

Except in Paola, where the confluence of state regulations, local virus rates and promised safety precautions resulted in a green light for a livestream festival performance of ""All My Sons."" The plan? For the cast of 10 to perform in front of an invited audience of family and friends that would fill the school's 297-seat theater to about one-third capacity. That is as close to normal as this year's festival could even dream of getting. Which is to say, not really very close at all. To veterans of the festival -- held for the past 25 years at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, whose facilities it gradually outgrew -- normal can bear some resemblance to ""Waiting for Guffman."" Abby Stuckrath, 18, who graduated this spring from Denver School of the Arts, remembers performing ""The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee"" for a 2018 main stage audience during a tornado warning -- and being told by her teacher that, should a tornado come their way and the auditorium be evacuated, ""You will stay in character."" (Stuckrath's character: Olive Ostrovsky, the Celia Keenan-Bolger role.) Alan Strait, who taught drama for years in Las Vegas, was once voted down by his own students when he suggested a spring-break theater trip to New York instead of a festival trip to Lincoln. These people are hard-core. But when, at the end of March, Indiana University canceled its summer activities, normal was no longer an option. The Educational Theater Association, the nonprofit that has produced the festival since 1941 and had expected 5,000 attendees in Bloomington, declared that the event would simply go online, with details TBA. Much of it, including workshops and the college fair, has been adapted to translate digitally. Online, the cost of admission is a more accessible $199, down from the in-person $865. And if Tina Fey was an unlikely get for an appearance in Indiana, she will be doing a live virtual Q. and A. with the students.

Amy Miller, who acted at the festival numerous times in her own student years, is now a drama teacher at New Albany High School in Indiana, where her production of ""My Fair Lady"" was chosen for this year's main stage. On the plus side, nixing the gathering means she won't have to worry about loading the show's bi-level set into two semis, and the costumes into a box truck. And she does have a professionally shot videotape that the festival can stream to its anticipated 2,500 participants. Still, Miller said, the cancellation hit her hard. ""I feel like a teenage drama queen using this language,"" she said, ""but it was a little devastating."" Early last December, when Corey Mitchell and his students at Northwest School of the Arts in Charlotte, N.C., put on ""A Chorus Line,"" he made the de rigueur preshow speech to the audience, instructing everyone to turn off their cellphones and explaining that because of copyright infringement, filming the performance was prohibited. Does the school have a video of it, though? Over the phone one recent afternoon, Mitchell's answer was a muffled scream of anguish.

But taking a production to the festival is an expensive endeavor; Mitchell's fund-raising goal for ""A Chorus Line"" was $125,000. The last time his school had a main stage show there was in 2013, when he brought ""The Color Purple"" to Lincoln -- a production chronicled in the documentary ""Purple Dreams"" and shimmeringly enshrined in Northwest memory. Brooke Watts, 19, who played Cassie in Mitchell's ""A Chorus Line,"" grew up wanting to do what she had seen the older kids do in ""The Color Purple."" ""My one theater dream,"" she said, ""was just to be on that big stage in Nebraska."" True, she noted, this year it would have been Indiana. But that is how large the festival looms as a marker of achievement in the school theater landscape. So it is also a place to make a statement, as Mitchell did with ""The Color Purple"" (""You don't see many predominantly African-American shows on that stage,"" he said) and wanted to do again with ""A Chorus Line."" His was a meticulous homage to the original 1975 production, he explained, ""except that over half the kids on the line are students of color.""

Which might not sound like a big deal, but Mitchell and Watts both said there were people in Charlotte who thought that Cassie, the Donna McKechnie/Charlotte d'Amboise role, had to be played by a white actress. Even Watts, who is black, wondered about that when she heard other students say so. ""The tradition on every Broadway show, every show that I've seen,"" she said, ""it's been a blond lady with a bob, like skinny. I have not seen an African-American Cassie ever."" This summer, the main stage audience will get a glimpse of one, anyway. The festival is the flagship event of the International Thespian Society, which has a membership of 130,000 and chapters in schools across the United States, as well as a smattering elsewhere. Its members are known as Thespians, with a capital T. An honor society that requires many hours logged in theater arts before admission is granted, it has an expansive list of famous alumni. Wayne Brady, Adam Driver and Aidy Bryant were Thespians; so were Zoe Kravitz, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Tom Hanks. Dick Van Dyke was a member. Madonna, too. All year, across the country, Thespians compete in events that were recently rebranded the Thespys. At the festival, those competitions have also gone digital, with students uploading videos of their performances for adjudication. But they have had to consider more than their skills with a camera, or how to perform in the absence of audience response. Maura Toole, 17, from Grimsley High School in Greensboro, N.C. -- a state where the coronavirus rate has risen lately -- was weighing whether to film her Thespys song, ""Falling Slowly"" from ""Once,"" in person with her duet partner or from their separate homes. ""By law, we can be together,"" she said. ""Our consciences are telling us that that's a bad idea right now, given what's going on in our community."" (Their verdict: separate spaces.)

Erielle Harris, 14, who just graduated from eighth grade at St. Martin's Episcopal School in Atlanta, also had the wider world on her mind. Planning to attend the virtual festival with her twin sister while FaceTiming with drama program friends, she said early this month that she hoped that Covid and Black Lives Matter would be part of the online conversation, to ""make sure everyone's educated."" Since then, the festival has announced a slate of diversity-themed programming, including a keynote address about racial equity by the Tony-winning director Kenny Leon. The thing about humans with smartphones is that they tend to be too entranced by their screens to pay much heed when someone tells them to put them away. Thank goodness for that, at least in the case of Northwest's ""A Chorus Line."" Needing to piece together a festival tribute to the production, Mitchell put out a call for any videos clandestinely shot by audience members.

In dress-rehearsal footage, Watts will be seen performing Cassie's big number, ""The Music and the Mirror."" There will be video, too, shot late last month at a theater in Charlotte, where the Northwest company gathered in socially distanced fashion to sing, a cappella, ""What I Did for Love."" For Carson Palmer, 18, who played Mike, that was a bittersweet reunion, and a reminder of the capstone to their high school careers that he and the cast's other seniors thought they would have. Just after graduation, there would have been an encore weekend of ""A Chorus Line"" in their school's 600-seat auditorium, then the trip to Bloomington. ""We were all so excited to have the June production be our last show together before going off to college,"" he said. ""It's wild to think that the show in December was actually the last time I'll be performing with my best friends."" 'If they bring it in, we're done' The rare luck of the students in Paola, Kan., is that they got to slip back into ""All My Sons"" -- a drama that Coats, their teacher, believes has only gained resonance with the advent of the coronavirus and the surge of Black Lives Matter protests.

""They're very conscious of the fact that if they bring it in, we're done,"" she said, two days after rehearsals started. ""If anybody gets exposed, we're finished."" For the festival performance, Coats said she would move actors out of the single cramped dressing room and into three other nearby rooms where they could spread out. Their makeup kits would be individual, not shared, and the makeup crew -- like the ushers -- gloved and masked. ""Obviously,"" she said, ""you can't social distance onstage, because the roles don't allow it."" They were taking a risk, Coats acknowledged, but one she considered acceptably small -- even if a what-if kind of worry kept her up at night. ""If I could put them all in plastic wrap and keep them isolated totally until we're done,"" she said, ""I would do it in a heartbeat."" The coronavirus quickly proved wilier than they were. A week into rehearsals, a crew member tested positive. The county's contact tracing program swung into action; a few students got calls. Yet the impulse was not to close the production. Consulting with the health department, Coats scrambled to reassess, asking her other students and their parents if they felt comfortable continuing. They said they did. And Coats, who also got a contact tracer's call, announced that she would direct via video from quarantine, while requiring her cast and crew, in the theater, to wear masks offstage and on.

""The masks will actually help you work on projection and articulation,"" she advised her actors via email, ever the educator. The show would go on, with their faces uncovered for the livestream. And then Coats reconsidered. A couple of days later, she canceled the performance. She declined to say, for this article, what had changed, but the crew member was among nine new local coronavirus cases reported that week, according to The Miami County Republic. Until that abrupt end, though, Coats's students had had the luxury of the nearly normal: being in a room together, making theater -- something so many people, their fellow Thespians included, are aching to do. Through these long pandemic months, a line from ""Hamilton"" has played on repeat in Coats's head: ""the world turned upside down."" With her company gathered, it felt for a little while like the world was righting itself again. But it isn't. Not yet. And so for these Kansans, as for legions of festival goers, virtual is as real as it gets this summer. It's not much like being there. But at least they'll not be there together.",Thousands of students should have been gathering to cheer on the year's best shows.

Art & Design,Wild Waves and Quiet Streets: 2 Artists Working From Memory,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/arts/design/wild-waves-and-quiet-streets-2-artists-working-from-memory.html,"The Metropolitan Museum of Art excels at discreet introductions: modest, magnetic shows that enable us to make the acquaintance of artists many of us have barely heard of. Occasionally these shows establish an unexpected reciprocity, their commonalities and differences evolving into a lively dialogue.

An odd pairing of this sort is the gift of two small shows of mostly small paintings by two 19th-century artists. ""Peder Balke: Painter of Northern Light"" presents the work of a Norwegian artist revered in his homeland for his renderings of some of its most dramatic coastline vistas in his first show in the United States, and it has been organized by Asher Ethan Miller, a curator of European paintings. ""City of Memory: William Chappel's Views of Early 19th-Century New York,"" organized by Amy Bogansky when she was a research associate in the American Wing, is the first time the Met has shown all 27 of its paintings by this American tinsmith and amateur artist -- his extant work -- since acquiring them in 1954. Together they illuminate different ways of being an artist, the role of observation and memory in art, the importance of size, the difference between trained and untrained talent, and also the growth of nationalism.

Balke (1804-87) and Chappel (1801-78) were almost exactly the same age, and shared humble origins and an inborn romanticism, but they worked in different styles, under vastly different circumstances on opposite sides of the Atlantic. Balke, who led something of a charmed existence, came to paint the natural sublime of coastal Norway, a region then struggling to achieve independence and national identity. Today he is considered one of its greatest Romantic artists. Chappel had a more hardscrabble life, probably spent entirely in Manhattan, and toward its end he painted scenes of everyday life in the budding metropolis of his childhood. Neither man was destined to be an artist; both worked largely from memory and died in obscurity. Chappel's was lifelong; Balke's was not.

Born to landless peasants, Balke was lifted from rural life by talent so evident that the locals bankrolled the early phase of an artistic education that took him from Oslo to Copenhagen and Stockholm. He loved Norway's wildness, making several walking treks through it. But his formative experience came in 1832. Traveling by boat up Norway's west coast, he found his own Mont Sainte-Victoire: the big, startlingly rectangular headlands of the North Cape (NordKapp), jutting into the North Atlantic -- and thought at the time to be the northernmost point of Europe. He saw it only once and may have made sketches (although virtually none survive), but it, and the waves crashing around it, haunted his work from then on. In ""The North Cape"" (1853), the first of the 17 Balke paintings in the show, we see this promontory as a broad horizontal seemingly formed by a single brush stroke. It announces Balke's interest in paint as material, even if the scene's moonlight is so excessively bright and sharp that you may be forgiven for thinking it has a small light attached to its frame. It gives you the feeling Balke sometimes had more talent than he could control.","Peder Balke and William Chappel, subjects of shows at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, were very different painters but had a surprising amount in common.",26d37db0-6eb1-5fbc-bbb4-58ab68ff84f5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/02/arts/02METPAINTERSPEDERBALKE1/02METPAINTERSPEDERBALKE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=d0bd9411ac24adc549d9cf44b5a253787b26f84b3a38efb08c5956c271eaa6c3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""Ships in a Storm,"" an oil on wood from the 1870s, is part of the exhibition ""Peder Balke: Painter of Northern Light"" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.",26d37db0-6eb1-5fbc-bbb4-58ab68ff84f5,N24News/imgs/26d37db0-6eb1-5fbc-bbb4-58ab68ff84f5.jpg,14
Television,Tom Bergeron Is Out as 'Dancing With the Stars' Host After 15 Years,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/arts/television/dancing-with-the-stars-tom-bergeron.html,"Tom Bergeron Is Out as 'Dancing With the Stars' Host After 15 Years 
* None  

After spending nearly a quarter of his life as the host of ""Dancing With the Stars,"" Tom Bergeron, the 65-year-old host of the one-time ABC ratings juggernaut, has been dropped from the show, he announced on Twitter on Monday evening. ""Just informed @DancingABC will be continuing without me,"" he wrote. ""It's been an incredible 15-year run and the most unexpected gift of my career."" ABC and BBC Studios, the show's production company, said in a joint statement that ""Dancing With the Stars"" would be pursuing ""a new creative direction"" and that Mr. Bergeron would not be part of it. Erin Andrews, the sports announcer and former contestant on the show, who had co-hosted with Mr. Bergeron since 2014, was also out, the statement said. Ms. Andrews, who announced her departure on Twitter this morning, thanked Mr. Bergeron and the show's cast for making her six seasons with the show memorable. ""I will always cherish my days on set, even if I wasn't the best at walking in heels,"" she wrote. Mr. Bergeron, a funnyman known for his wit and charisma, is the only star to have hosted every season of ""Dancing With the Stars"" since its 2005 debut. Although the show had once been a regular at the top of the ratings charts, viewership had been flagging in recent seasons. Last fall's season finale attracted the show's smallest-ever audience for a final episode. Last year, Mr. Bergeron publicly aired his concerns about the decision to cast political guests on the show. The comment came after the show decided to include Sean Spicer, the former White House press secretary and communications director for President Trump, as a contestant. Mr. Spicer took the stage for the Season 28 premiere in a garish, highlighter-yellow, ruffled shirt and tight white pants. His shimmy to the Spice Girls's ""Spice Up Your Life"" alongside Lindsay Arnold, a professional dancer, was less than technically sound. He joined a number of Republican-affiliated contestants who had appeared before him, including Bristol Palin, the daughter of Sarah Palin, the former G.O.P. vice-presidential candidate; and Rick Perry, the former Texas governor who ran for president. Mr. Bergeron said he had met with the show's new executive producer without success in an effort to ensure that the show ""would be a joyful respite from our exhausting political climate and free of inevitably divisive bookings from ANY party affiliations."" Mr. Bergeron had been hosting the show since it first aired in 2005. ""We can agree to disagree, as we do now, but it's ultimately their call,"" he wrote on Twitter last August. Before his ""Dancing With the Stars"" tenure, Mr. Bergeron was the face of ""America's Funniest Home Videos,"" the viewer-sourced TV series that he hosted for 15 seasons. He also hosted the game show ""Hollywood Squares"" from 1998 to 2004. His departure came as an unwelcome surprise -- Mr. Bergeron told ""Access Hollywood"" in 2012 that he wanted to host the show ""'til they drag me kicking and screaming off the set."" But even amid his shock Monday evening, Mr. Bergeron managed to crack one final joke. ""Now what am I supposed to do with all of these glitter masks?"" he tweeted.","The longtime host and his co-host, Erin Andrews, were let go by ABC, which said it had plans to take the show in a new direction.",eb6a7bb8-d14e-5d71-a3eb-08e9e97427e3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/14/arts/14dwts-bergeron-andrews/14dwts-bergeron-andrews-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=3918c930c6103baa56efdbcfa398312b5c6da8ab1700272c629b2758cb184511&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews will not be returning to host ""Dancing With the Stars"" after ABC announced a plan to move in a new direction.",eb6a7bb8-d14e-5d71-a3eb-08e9e97427e3,N24News/imgs/eb6a7bb8-d14e-5d71-a3eb-08e9e97427e3.jpg,3
Global Business,China Says Army Is Not Behind Attacks in Report,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/business/global/china-says-army-not-behind-attacks-in-report.html,"SHANGHAI -- A day after a United States security company accused a People's Liberation Army unit in Shanghai of engaging in cyberwarfare against American corporations, organizations and government agencies, China's defense ministry issued a strong denial and insisted that the report was flawed.

At a news conference in Beijing on Wednesday, the ministry suggested that the allegations were destructive and challenged the study, which was produced by Mandiant, an American computer security company. The report identified P.L.A. Unit 61398 in Shanghai as one of the most aggressive computer hacking operations in the world.

Geng Yansheng, a spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, said that China had been the victim of cyberattacks that have originated in the United States and that Mandiant had mischaracterized China's activities.

""Chinese military forces have never supported any hacking activities,"" Mr. Geng said at the briefing. ""The claim by the Mandiant company that the Chinese military engages in Internet espionage has no foundation in fact.""","The Ministry of National Defense said a security company's research linking a military unit to thousands of hacking attempts against United States targets ""has no foundation in fact.""",b904a6b3-4968-5727-869a-97a22d95b577,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/02/21/business/Hack/Hack-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=479271a4b83cf57bbc74de017d1393662dd36c5b6a236639ebb060a714b206cf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Hong Lei of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2010.

Science,"As Seas Warm, Whales Face New Dangers",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/02/science/humpbacks-right-whales.html,"MOUNT DESERT ROCK, Me. -- From the top of the six-story lighthouse, water stretches beyond the horizon in every direction. A foghorn bleats twice at 22-second intervals, interrupting the endless chatter of herring gulls. At least twice a day, beginning shortly after dawn, researchers climb steps and ladders and crawl through a modest glass doorway to scan the surrounding sea, looking for the distinctive spout of a whale. This chunk of rock, about 25 nautical miles from Bar Harbor, is part of a global effort to track and learn more about one of the sea's most majestic and endangered creatures. So far this year, the small number of sightings here have underscored the growing perils along the East Coast to both humpback whales and North Atlantic right whales. This past summer, the numbers of humpback whales identified from the rock were abysmal -- the team saw only eight instead of the usual dozens. Fifty-three humpbacks have died in the last 19 months, many after colliding with boats or fishing gear.

""Food is becoming more patchy and less reliable, so animals are moving around more,"" said Scott Kraus, vice president and chief scientist at the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at the New England Aquarium. ""The more you move around, the higher the chance of entanglements."" The North Atlantic right whales, which prefer colder waters, are also on a changed course -- with even more dire consequences. Fifteen of the animals have died since mid-April in a population that has now slipped to fewer than 450. ""We haven't seen this level of mortality in right whales since we stopped whaling them"" in coastal New England in the 1700s, said Dr. Kraus.

Digital algorithms make identifications a little easier, dividing the photos into categories of fluke patterns, mainly by determining how much of the tail is white or black. But researchers, including Lindsey Jones, a graduate student at the College of the Atlantic, which runs the station, must still look through several thousand images one by one to match by eye. It should be possible to build a better algorithm, but no one in the small, dedicated field of whale research has the funding to pay for one. Luckily, some matches are easy. Researchers on the island see many Gulf of Maine whales often enough that they recognize them on sight. The high number of humpback deaths from January 2016 to Sept. 1 of this year led the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to declare an ""unusual mortality event."" No one knows exactly what's going on, but the agency's investigations attributed half of the deaths to ship strikes.

Mr. DenDanto and several investigators with Allied Whale, a group affiliated with the College of the Atlantic, plan to begin a research project next year, analyzing bits of skin from humpbacks, collected using biopsy darts, to determine what the animals are eating and how that affects their health. Steven Katona, a co-founder of Allied Whale, was one of the first researchers to begin identifying whales here in the 1970s. Dr. Katona and his collaborators took pictures for the humpback whale catalog, which later confirmed their hunches that fluke patterns were consistent across a whale's lifetime. In 1975, they named one of the first North Atlantic humpbacks na00008, or Number 8. The whale has been spotted three times since: in Canada's Gulf of St. Lawrence in the 1980s, off the coast of the Dominican Republic in 1993, and earlier this year off the coast of New Jersey. ""We have only a handful of sightings of this whale, yet these link together the efforts of collaborators spanning much of the North Atlantic,"" Peter T. Stevick, a senior scientist with the North Atlantic Humpback Whale Catalog, said in an email.

The catalog has also allowed researchers to see that the whales breed at the edge of the Caribbean Sea, then fan out to traditional feeding areas, from the East Coast to Newfoundland, Labrador, Greenland and Iceland. Understanding the whales' behavior remains key to helping them survive in warming waters shared with fishermen and ships, said Judy Allen, associate director of Allied Whale. ""These are animals that are difficult to study,"" Ms. Allen said. ""They spend most of their lives underwater. We see a brief glimpse when they lift their tails out of the water and somebody happens to be there with a camera."" Right whales are generally seen in the Gulf of Maine, the coast of the Canadian Maritimes and the Gulf of St. Lawrence in the summer. In the winter, pregnant females and others migrate along the Eastern Seaboard to the Southeast. They don't have distinctive flukes; their bodies are wider, and they're less graceful than their humpback cousins. So researchers identify them using the pattern of each animal's ""callosity"" -- the roughened skin patches on their heads. Because these formations can only be seen from the top, scientists must use planes and boats to track them.

Researchers based on Cape Cod begin flying in the winter months when right whales, which can grow as long as a five-story building, seek out food and social interaction in the waters off Massachusetts. The low-flying plane rides are so dangerous that scientists undergo ""dunk training,"" learning to survive if the plane drops into the frigid sea, miles from shore. The North Atlantic Right Whale Catalog, managed by the New England Aquarium, includes images of 722 whales, chronicling the population since the early 1970s. The work has been particularly crucial this year, when there have been so many unexplained deaths. Twelve carcasses have turned up so far this year in Canada and three more in American waters; only five calves were born, as far as researchers can tell. The latest estimates, released by the New England Aquarium, put the population of North Atlantic right whales at 458 -- but that was before this year's deaths, Dr. Kraus said. Flying 750 to 1,000 feet over the animals also allows researchers to check on their health, making sure they are not dragging fishing ropes or bearing new scars, said Charles ""Stormy"" Mayo, director of the Right Whale Ecology Program at the Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, Mass. Right whales are baleen whales, so they filter feed, supporting their 70-ton weight -- nearly as much as the Space Shuttle -- solely with microscopic animals called zooplankton. That search can push whales into shipping lanes, where the animals are sometimes struck, or into the gear of fishing boats.",Scientists are worrying that many humpback and right whales are dying.,010c6ce6-4181-5905-a56b-67951ea03bd5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/03/science/03SCI-WHALES1/03SCI-WHALES1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=494379c2929b3e43d70bca902906f3f45ff3b4328587504c7e8951fa1322e829&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A breaching humpback whale.

Food,18 Easy Holiday Desserts,https://www.nytimes.com/article/easy-holiday-desserts.html,"Whether you're an experienced baker who makes a Hogwarts sorting hat croquembouche for fun, or a beginner who rarely turns on the oven, sometimes you want something delicious and festive that you can throw together in a snap. These 18 simple recipes are just that, and most of them take less prep time than it takes to watch ""The Grinch."" (The 25-minute 1966 original, of course.)

Technically, this is not a baking recipe, but it's so incredibly good, who cares? This salty-sweet treat, which came to The Times from Kelly Mahoney, a reader in Boulder, Colo., calls for just saltine crackers, sugar, butter, vanilla and chocolate. Some readers like to sprinkle the melted chocolate with crushed candy canes, flaky sea salt or chopped nuts. You can make it with salted matzo in place of the saltines, too.

Nell Lewis of Platte City, Mo., entered the Pillsbury Bake-Off contest with this recipe in 1963. She didn't win, but the recipe has since become an internet favorite for its impossibly tender crumb and sugary crust. This is the only cake recipe on this list that requires an electric mixer, but all you have to do is dump the ingredients into the bowl and beat it like mad for a good three minutes.

This banana bread from Erin Jeanne McDowell is here to use up the four overripe bananas that are languishing on your counter or in the back of your freezer. Make it chocolate-chocolate chip banana bread by substituting some cocoa powder for the flour. (See the tip in the recipe for measurements.) Oh, and thankfully, it requires no mixer.

Melissa Clark's 20-minute no-bake bars are inspired by buckeyes and peanut butter cups, but with an added layer of caramelized flavor that comes from browning the butter before stirring it into the cookie crumb crust. It's also wildly adaptable: Use almond butter instead of peanut butter, add Rice Krispies to the filling or sprinkle the top with flaky sea salt or crushed pretzels.

This shortbread, which came to The Times from Amy Casey, a reader in Sparta, N.J., is so easy it feels a little silly. Melt the butter, add the rest of the ingredients, then stir to combine. Press into a pan, top with plenty of sugar and bake. Some readers like to add a dash of cardamom or citrus zest. Good news: If you don't have rice flour, you can use cornstarch.

Readers went gaga over this one-bowl Depression-era cake from Melissa Clark. For a bit more flair, try adding a handful or two of chocolate chips to the batter, or slicking the top with a simple ganache. (One very helpful reader tip: Check your mayonnaise's ingredients before getting started; some contain dried onion powder, which would not taste great here.)

Melissa Clark's Instagram followers went nuts when she posted a picture of this plain-looking bittersweet-citrus cake on her feed: Campari and olive oil? Sign us up! Use the best olive oil you can as its fragrant notes will complement the astringency of the Campari. This is definitely a more sophisticated, less sweet cake, so if that's not your thing, try using Aperol instead as one Italian reader recommended.

A cheerful lemony cake is a nice break from the spiced and chocolaty desserts of the holiday season. Olive oil and buttermilk make this one from Melissa Clark impossibly tender and rich. For the tangiest results, use conventional lemons (not Meyer, which are milder), and really work the lemon zest into the granulated sugar. If you don't have buttermilk, use  1/4  cup milk plus  1/4  cup sour cream or plain yogurt in its place.

Leftover gingerbread house pieces were the inspiration for this recipe from Melissa Clark, but you can use store-bought gingersnaps instead (or the remains of that gingerbread house kit your kid never finished). Be sure to let them rest for a couple of days before serving.",No-fuss treats for a sweet season.,52dcc3bb-22a3-5755-ac05-0db8f20dade7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/21/dining/21COOKING-LEMONALMONDTART4/21COOKING-LEMONALMONDTART4-facebookJumbo.jpg,Pan-baked lemon almond tart.,52dcc3bb-22a3-5755-ac05-0db8f20dade7,N24News/imgs/52dcc3bb-22a3-5755-ac05-0db8f20dade7.jpg,17
Media,Essence Names Interim Chief After Claim of 'Abusive Work Culture',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/business/media/essence-magazine-accusations.html,"An anonymous essay published on Sunday criticized Essence, the groundbreaking Black media brand, citing an ""abusive work culture"" in which bullying and sexual harassment were common. Since then, Essence has installed Caroline A. Wanga, a former Target executive, as its interim leader and has also pledged to hire law firms to conduct a review of workplace issues. The essay, titled ""The Truth About Essence,"" was published on the digital platform Medium under the byline Black Female Anonymous, which has identified itself as a group of former and current Essence employees. The essay is part of an online campaign that includes Twitter and Instagram accounts and a change.org petition, which has collected more than 2,000 signatures. A target of Black Female Anonymous is Richelieu Dennis, the owner of Essence Ventures, the parent company of the magazine and Essence Communications. Mr. Dennis, the founder of Sundial Brands, a Black beauty products company, bought Essence from Time Inc. in 2018.

The essay said Mr. Dennis ""tried to force Essence employees and contractors to sign nondisclosure agreements"" to protect him and his family from ""liability or disparagement after a string of wrongful layoffs."" It also said that Mr. Dennis's wife, Martha Dennis, whom it described as the company's head of human resources, should not serve in that role, calling the arrangement a ""blatant conflict of interest."" (An Essence spokeswoman denied that Ms. Dennis was the head of human resources, saying that she had ""advised the company in its ongoing HR transition"" as the company ""searched for a full-time HR lead."") Later in the essay, the writers said the problems at Essence predated the arrival of Mr. Dennis. They faulted a previous Essence leader, Michelle Ebanks, blaming her for a ""toxic culture."" Ms. Ebanks stepped down as the chief executive of Essence Communications in March, after nearly 20 years at the company, and is a member of the Essence board. The essay also had criticism for two other Essence leaders, the chief operating officer, Joy Collins Profet, and the chief content officer, MoAna Luu. In the Medium essay and on social media, Black Female Anonymous has called for the resignations of Ms. Profet and Ms. Luu; demanded that Ms. Ebanks leave the board; and demanded that Mr. Dennis have nothing to do with running Essence. The group has given Ms. Wanga, the interim leader, until the ""close of business"" on Friday to comply.

""The once exalted media brand dedicated to Black women has been hijacked by cultural and corporate greed and an unhinged abuse of power,"" the writers said in the essay. Citing ""an abusive work culture,"" the essay's writers also said that Black women at the company ""are systematically suppressed by pay inequity, sexual harassment, corporate bullying, intimidation, colorism and classism.""
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Ms. Wanga joined the company as its chief growth officer on Monday. On Tuesday -- two days after the essay was posted -- Mr. Dennis named her the interim chief executive. In a statement on Thursday, Latraviette Smith-Wilson, an Essence spokeswoman, described the essay's ""accusations and demands"" as ""unsupported and outdated."" The statement also addressed Ms. Ebanks, saying she ""has had no role in day-to-day operations since her departure,"" and said that Ms. Collins Profet ""had already accepted a new role with another company before the anonymous blog was posted."" Ms. Luu, the head of content, ""will step back from day-to-day operations during the course of the review,"" the statement said. Mr. Dennis has also stepped away from the daily leadership role he had assumed since the departure of Ms. Ebanks, the company said in a separate statement. The spokeswoman added that Ms. Wanga would oversee the ""independent review"" of the Essence workplace.

A person who identified herself as a representative of the essay's writers, contacted through the Black Female Anonymous Instagram account, declined to be interviewed for this article. Long a touchstone of Black culture, Essence celebrated its 50th anniversary with its May issue, which featured the model Naomi Campbell on the cover. The magazine has a circulation of more than one million and its website attracts nearly seven million unique visitors each month. The company also runs the annual Essence Festival in New Orleans, a celebration of Black culture that has drawn headliners like Aretha Franklin, Mary J. Blige and John Legend. (The festival was canceled this year and replaced with a digital event because of the coronavirus pandemic.) The anonymous essay was published at a time when many other media companies have wrestled with race and discrimination against Black employees and other workers of color. The top editor of Bon Appetit, Adam Rapoport, resigned last month after a photo of him costumed in stereotypical Puerto Rican attire resurfaced on social media. His departure was part of a larger revolt at the magazine's parent company, Conde Nast. Similar uprisings have taken place at The New York Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the women's lifestyle website Refinery29. In the essay, Black Female Anonymous tied their efforts to the larger social protest movement that has swept the country. ""The demand for a new America calls for the complete accountability of all Americans, even those of us in Black America and our cultural institutions,"" the writers said. ""Black women deserve to feel safe both in white America and Black America."" In a Wednesday letter to Ms. Wanga, Black Female Anonymous asked for a guarantee that Mr. Dennis would not have a role in running Essence and that the three other executives they had identified leave the company by the ""close of business"" on Friday. The letter, which was posted on social media, also demanded that Essence be transparent about the law firms it will hire for the planned review, adding that they must not have ties to Mr. Dennis or others in leadership roles.



In an Instagram post on Thursday, Ms. Wanga sounded optimistic about the future of Essence. ""I don't believe in losses,"" she wrote. ""You win and you learn. The conversations @richelieudennis and I started a few months ago about his strategic vision for @Essence and the opportunity to be on a team furthering the health/wealth of the global black diaspora, across a portfolio of businesses including @essence, was a 'win.' A win stitched together by a 50-year legacy of black creatives, businesses, and community that I would be honored to be a part of."" Ms. Wanga noted that she had ""learned there are things that need to be better for our team and culture -- and I'm ready to begin that work,"" adding, ""I'm committed to flourishing while fixing and fastening what needs to work to be in service to our teams, communities and partners. So let's GOOOOOOOOOO!!!!"" She ended her statement with the hashtag ""#BlackWomenRiseTogether."" Black Female Anonymous replied to Ms. Wanga on social media. ""We don't want @Essence to fold,"" the group said. ""But we must fix the systemic brokenness of any Black cultural institution that devalues Black women. We're counting on you, Caroline. Fix it or fold.""",An anonymous post on Medium that said it was written by current and former Essence employees is part of a social media campaign for change at the groundbreaking Black media brand.,15df9700-3219-5a62-862c-0e9fd91dd769,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/03/business/02unrest-essence-print/02unrest-essence-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=ca50ac128ba40b7c4e00f57579ce6d2634c9a4400ac22f1892d98007e60fe410&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Richelieu Dennis, the owner of Essence Ventures, at the 2018 Essence Festival in New Orleans.",15df9700-3219-5a62-862c-0e9fd91dd769,N24News/imgs/15df9700-3219-5a62-862c-0e9fd91dd769.jpg,16
Style,"Johnny Depp Is NOT Best Friends With This Lizard, Despite Report",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/style/gossip-cop-trump-stormy-daniels.html,"Gossip Cop exists to debunk celebrity rumors. It claims to surveil ""more than 200 websites, TV shows, newspapers and magazines"" for inaccuracies. Since 2009, the site's unmistakably urgent headlines -- ""Jennifer Aniston Did NOT 'Flee To Italy' Amid Brad Pitt Reunion Rumors, Despite Report""; ""George Clooney, Amal 'Divorce' Claim Is Late And Wrong""; ""Selena Gomez 'Shocked' Justin Bieber Married Hailey Baldwin Is Made-Up Story"" -- have been written to challenge even the most frivolous of tabloid stories. When Star reported, for example, that a New York City restaurant prevented the actor Emma Stone from consuming a homemade birthday cake on its premises, Gossip Cop located an unnamed ""pal"" to dispute the account. That editorial mission makes reading Gossip Cop a confusing experience. Plenty of people would be interested if Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston secretly reunited -- one of the many recurring rumors that Gossip Cop deflates -- but how much does the populace care about Radar's report on Jessica Simpson's monthly expenditure on Postmates deliveries? Or the veracity of Star's claim that Kanye West secretly wants to open a restaurant? For whom does it matter that these stories might be false? Gossip Cop relies heavily on celebrity publicists to knock down rumors about their famous clients, so it's tempting to dismiss the site as a public relations arm of the entertainment industry. But there is an emerging rigor to Gossip Cop's methodology, reflected in the latest iteration of the site and the actions of the website's founder, Michael E. Lewittes. On the surface, it appears that Gossip Cop has ambitions to become, or at least be treated like, a full-blown fact-checking service on par with PolitiFact and Snopes. This notion is disputed by Mr. Lewittes, a former Access Hollywood producer and tabloid columnist who launched the site with financial backing from Dan Abrams, a television journalist and founder of Abrams Media, the boutique online publisher of Mediaite and The Mary Sue. (Mr. Abrams is listed as co-owner and co-founder, but is not connected to the editorial content of the site; he currently serves as chief legal correspondent for ABC News.)

Mr. Lewittes and Mr. Abrams attended high school together in the Bronx. Both grew up in families laden with lawyers. Mr. Abrams is the son of the First Amendment attorney Floyd Abrams and the older brother of Ronnie Abrams, a federal judge in the Southern District of New York. Ronnie Abrams is married to Greg Andres, a former federal prosecutor who now works for the office of Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russia's efforts to interfere with the 2016 election. And Mr. Lewittes is the son of Joel Lewittes, a former federal judge, also in New York's Southern District, and his wife, Lee Kushnir Lewittes, is a booker for the Fox News morning show ""Fox & Friends."" (According to an online newsletter published earlier this year, the Lewittes family attends Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun, the Upper East Side synagogue that, until early 2017, counted Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump as members.) In 2009, Mr. Lewittes and Mr. Abrams framed the site as a corrective to an out-of-control tabloid press. Not only would it be a ""media watchdog,"" as Mr. Abrams put it, but a source of feel-good news about celebrities. Beside videos of paparazzi behaving badly were sections called ""Hollygood"" and ""Hollywood Heart,"" both devoted to documenting celebrity philanthropy. Mr. Lewittes, in particular, wanted to combat what he saw as a nihilistic streak in the Hollywood press. ""We live in a time when many feel being first or outrageous is more important than being factual, and I want to change that,"" he told Mr. Abrams's media news site, Mediaite. ""Not only are people filing false reports on their blogs every day, but so much of what is out there is just meanspirited for no reason at all.""

The site was also built as act of repentance. Mr. Lewittes describes himself not just as ""creator, owner, founder and 'Top Cop'"" of the site, but as ""a reformed gossip columnist who knows the industry inside and out,"" and who worked previously at Access Hollywood, Us Weekly, The New York Daily News and The New York Post. He also did a stint at Star itself. The Gossip Cop masthead now lists only one other full time editor. Early on, the site drew skepticism for its methodology. Shortly after Gossip Cop's debut, an editor at New York magazine wrote: ""Publicist denials are not only boring, they're meaningless. These are people who are paid to lie to protect their clients."" In 2012, the Columbia Journalism Review questioned the wisdom of Gossip Cop using anonymous sources to challenge rumors by other anonymous sources. Or, as Craig Silverman, the founder of Regret the Error and expert on corrections in media, put it, ""How can we know that Gossip Cop's 'source' is better than In Touch's 'Insiders'?"" But for the past two years, Gossip Cop has participated in events held by the Poynter Institute's International Fact-Checking Network (I.F.C.N.), whose signatories are required to undergo an extensive audit and adhere to a detailed code of principles. The company has updated its about page to reflect those principles. Mr. Lewittes has attended Global Fact, I.F.C.N.'s annual summit, for the past two years. Being a verified signatory of I.F.C.N. is not particularly valuable by itself. It is, however, a ""minimum condition"" for becoming a third-party fact checker on Facebook's News Feed, a position that carries with it incredible power. Facebook, through these verified parties, says it deeply limits the spread of stories deemed false, and removes accounts that are flagged for violating policies. The quantity of false stories, these fact checkers said, is vast. Early on in this relationship with Facebook, fact-checking entities noted that there is no way for them to keep up with the high quantity of false or misleading information that circulates on Facebook. There can also be questions, apparently, of just how factual a fact is. In September, The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine and Facebook-certified fact checker, rated as false an online essay about Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's position on Roe v. Wade, possibly squelching that essay's Facebook readership. The nature of the fact-check, which hinged on the literal and colloquial meanings of the word ""said,"" and the liberal politics of ThinkProgress, where the disputed essay appeared, unleashed a furious debate about Facebook's role in refereeing, and suppressing, political commentary.

Gossip Cop would not discuss its future with I.F.C.N., whose signatories undergo a stringent review, or with Facebook, which has certified just five fact-checking outlets in the entire United States, including Snopes and Associated Press. Certainly the subject matter practice is different for a website that recently debunked rumors that Johnny Depp damaged his brain in a too-hot sauna, that Courteney Cox is obsessed with tarot cards and that Norman Reedus of ""The Walking Dead"" has a bad attitude on set (""Gossip Cop can debunk the baseless claim. It's simply not true.""). While giving verified independent outlets special license to fact-check may help embattled platforms like Facebook and Google help to restore their image in the short-term, in the long-term, as the Weekly Standard episode suggests, the same arrangement has the potential to do more damage. In January 2016, Gossip Cop began deleting thousands of old posts in what seems to have been an effort to organize and clean up its archives. One of the removed articles, published in October 2011, concerns the now-familiar allegation that Donald Trump and Stormy Daniels had an affair. The rumor had appeared on The Dirty, an Arizona-based gossip website, and was later picked up by the celebrity magazine Life & Style, which ran a 2-page spread under the headline, ""Did Donald CHEAT?"" (The question was not actually answered.) Two days later, Gossip Cop published a piece citing denials from both parties. An unnamed representative for Mr. Trump, identified hours later as Michael D. Cohen, described the rumor as ""totally untrue and ridiculous."" An unnamed attorney for Ms. Daniels, identified years later as Keith M. Davidson, accused The Dirty of concocting a fake scandal ""to lure potential customers to [their] commercial filth.'"" Gossip Cop's verdict: ""The story is 100% false."" ""The only people 'cheated' here are the tabloid's readers,"" the story said. Gossip Cop's treatment of this particular story presents a broader journalistic quandary. Confronted with the question of whether Mr. Trump and Ms. Daniels had a secret affair, the site did what most outlets would do: Ask both parties for comment and publish their responses. But lawyers and publicists are not always forthcoming about their own clients. Nor are the clients themselves. Indeed, around the same time Ms. Daniels denied the affair to Gossip Cop, she told other outlets, including The Dirty and In Touch, the exact opposite. In the seven years since the rumor of this affair surfaced, journalists have gathered evidence of its likelihood. Federal investigators have indicted Mr. Trump's former attorney, Mr. Cohen, over payments to Ms. Daniels and another woman, Karen McDougal, saying they violated federal campaign finance laws. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whose investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election spawned the inquiry into Mr. Cohen's payments, has not turned in a final report but House Democrats, who take control of the lower chamber in January, plan to investigate the president's role in paying Ms. Daniels and Ms. McDougal for their silence. Ms. Daniels' defamation lawsuit against Mr. Trump, which could unearth even more detail, awaits judgment before the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. (Representatives for Mr. Cohen and Mr. Davidson did not return requests for comment. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders referred questions to Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow, both of whom advise President Trump. Neither responded.)

And in the years since Gossip Cop first debunked the Trump-Daniels affair, it has beefed up its daily editorial process. Several years ago, an item about, say, Jennifer Aniston allegedly boycotting the country of Japan, required a short blog post at most. Now, Gossip Cop regularly publishes lengthy and nuanced analyses of why exactly a rumor is unlikely, citing factors such as the lack of photographic evidence or eyewitness testimony, the publication's track record, and the rumor's overall plausibility. In early April, the website began appending a list of sources to every article, including the names of elusive Hollywood publicists. Gossip Cop will revisit some stories a year after publication and gauge whether or not they turned out to be true. The site acknowledges that celebrities and their handlers have a capacity to lie: ""In an effort not to be 'spun,' we have, for lack of a better phrase, a 'social contract' with the stars, the reps and anyone else with whom we work,"" the site explains. ""If you lie to Gossip Cop, we won't work with you again."" Around the world, the spheres of politics and entertainment continue to overlap. The need for fact-checking outlets with an understanding of tabloid and celebrity culture, which is now political culture, is only likely to grow. Facebook, as is its way, wouldn't go into detail about its process for certifying third-party fact checkers. Controversially, the company enforces nondisclosure agreements with fact-checking partners, leaving the facts about fact-checking in a state of shadow. And Gossip Cop, for its part, would not speak of its plans for the future of fact-checking. But there is a world in which Gossip Cop could help determine what celebrity gossip gets to even exist on the internet. The Trump-Daniels affair is an uncomfortable reminder that in 2018, celebrity gossip can regularly be the real news. Almost every outlet that has covered the scandal has quoted or mentioned the story in The Dirty to establish the fact that the rumor predated Mr. Trump's presidential campaign. Seven long years ago, Gossip Cop deemed the underlying rumor as false. Maybe more disturbingly, it also was one of only two outlets that bothered to check it out at all.",A website called Gossip Cop fact-checks gossip.

Dance,Finding Sharp Differences in the Similarities,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/arts/dance/sidra-bell-dance-and-spectrum-dance-perform-at-summerstage.html,"An opening act can work as a warm-up or an appetizer, but sometimes the main function of the show before the show is contrastive, putting into relief the virtues of the main event. Such was the case at SummerStage in Central Park on Wednesday, when Sidra Bell Dance New York opened for Spectrum Dance Theater from Seattle.

Ms. Bell's ""Unidentifiable; Bodies"" featured an electronic sound score, by Ms. Bell, that in its idling and crunching conjured in my mind a garbage truck of the future. But it wasn't just the sound that was trashy. Whether posturing like models on a catwalk or stumbling as if on the unsteady ground of some inhospitable planet, the four dancers were relentlessly fake. The shapeless 30-minute piece felt interminable.

It may have been a coincidence that one image in Ms. Bell's work -- the dancers addressing one another like aliens summoning the mother ship -- also appeared in Spectrum's first selection, ""Septet."" But many of the adjectives you might apply to Ms. Bell's aesthetic -- ""slick,"" ""in your face,"" ""dystopian""-- have long been standard descriptors for the work of Donald Byrd, the veteran choreographer who took over Spectrum in 2002.

Those adjectives would suit Mr. Byrd's ""Septet,"" in which the dancers slap their biceps like heroin addicts and have the look of meanspirited gymnasts. Ms. Bell could be seen to be working in Mr. Byrd's field. But what a difference in invention and compositional sophistication. ""Septet"" is set to a difficult modernist string quartet by Charles Wuorinen, and Mr. Byrd is attuned to both the music's form and to its agitation. His choreography has a complementary structural logic.",Sidra Bell Dance New York and Spectrum Dance Theater left contrasting impressions on Wednesday at SummerStage in Central Park.,b9c60def-b461-585f-a1ea-9067b782a195,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/09/arts/09SPECTRUM/09SPECTRUM-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=398&w=600&s=eaed7cc77d150e7f579a109266b7ddb3ab8f48b7908537c3cf2e426d1b9c1515&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"From left, Alex Crozier and Davione Gordon of Spectrum Dance Theater performing at SummerStage in Central Park on Wednesday.",b9c60def-b461-585f-a1ea-9067b782a195,N24News/imgs/b9c60def-b461-585f-a1ea-9067b782a195.jpg,6
Art & Design,Nam June Paik at the Whitney: A Work of Dizzying Complexity,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/arts/design/whitney-museum-nam-june-paik.html,"Nam June Paik's 1989 ""Fin de Siecle II"" at the Whitney Museum. More than 200 television monitors display images taken from broadcast television and video art.





Many of the works in ""Programmed: Rules, Codes and Choreographies in Art, 1965-2018,"" an exhibition at the Whitney Museum, require an electrical outlet. The presentation -- drawn mostly from the museum's collection -- involves much in the way of video projections, lights, television sets, voice-overs, soundtracks, computers, computer programs and, in the most recent efforts, touch screens. Yet regardless of whether power sources are needed, all the artworks use algorithms. That is, they are executed according to plans, instructions, numerical systems, or, as the show's subtitle indicates, rules, codes and choreographies. The analog examples tend to be foundational works of Minimal and Conceptual Art: Donald Judd's 1965 aluminum relief based on the Fibonacci numerical sequence; a Sol LeWitt wall drawing from 1976 executed to written directions applicable to walls of any dimension; and Joseph Kosuth's string of five words in green neon that reads ""Five Words in Green Neon"" (1965). Then there is the show's most plugged work in several senses: Nam June Paik's 1989 ""Fin de Siecle II,"" a monumental video wall of dizzying complexity formed by 207 television monitors of varying sizes arranged in adjoining grids. They emit a disorienting, enrapturing flood of images and music taken from broadcast television and video art and programmed to repeat relentlessly, mutate wildly and change abruptly, although a driving, danceable beat is constant.

All kinds of culture, high and low, pass before our eyes and into our ears. David Bowie pirouettes in a white suit with Louise Lecavalier, a former soloist with the acrobatic Canadian dance troupe La La La Human Steps, while singing ""Look Back in Anger."" Merce Cunningham, in a red leotard, dances a solo and is shadowed by his own outline, in black. An image of a nude woman is put through numerous paces, multiplied different ways, in different colors, sometimes looking like an early Warhol painting , and is accompanied by an ecstatic blast of Philip Glass's music.

We see the head of Joseph Beuys performing in his signature hat, growling into a mike. His face appears on the central grid of monitors and then goes big, one massive image spread across them all. Especially complex are the machinations of a series of robot-like animated heads, both wireframe and solid blue with red lips. They start small, expand and then zoom in for grids of eyes or mouths. Metallic-looking piano keyboards, musical notes and a vast recording-studio control console twist and churn. These animations are all from Paik's most extensively used visual and aural source: Kraftwerk's 1986 music video for ""Musique Non Stop,"" a pioneering early example of computer-generated animation by Rebecca Allen. (Her name appears in part of the piece, as does that of Paul Garrin, who, as Paik's assistant, was responsible for the variations on the female nude.) ""Musique Non Stop"" also supplies the main soundtrack; its mechanized sound and distorted voices, like its animation, are of a piece with Kraftwerk's robot aesthetic.

The grids of smaller monitors around the edges exude layered images and motifs. (Stars reminiscent of the American flag are frequent.) These spin in and out of view, their abstract patterns evoke pulsating electronic quilts. ""Fin de Siecle II"" is the lodestar, the magnetic center of ""Programmed."" Visitors return to it repeatedly, often with cameras poised, sometimes just staring in disbelief. It seems unbelievable that Paik's masterpiece is 30 years old. He made it for the Whitney's 1989 exhibition ""Image World: Art and Media Culture"" -- which like this one, looked to art's unfolding future. It was given to the museum in 1993, but has never again been on view ; the label calls it ""partially restored,"" indicating a difficult rehabilitation. The thrill of seeing ""Fin de Siecle II"" again is part of the thrill of the whole show, which ends with several recent digital works commissioned by the museum. In this way, ""Programmed"" offers an optimistic snapshot of the Whitney's mission today, especially its determination to acquire, and foster new, experimental work, while giving older works in its collection fresh relevance.

Food,Questlove's Latest Quest: Bringing Chefs Together,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/dining/questlove-chef-food-salon.html,"In chunky glasses and a comfy cardigan decorated with a carrot brooch, Questlove looked like your favorite uncle as he worked the crowd at his food salon. The 45-year-old musician and D.J., whose birth name is Ahmir Thompson, hosts one every few months. On a recent night, it was in his Lower Manhattan apartment building and he had invited enough famous actors, writers and musicians to make a TMZ reporter weep. (Was that the musical director for ""Hamilton""? Is FKA Twigs in the bathroom? Has Gayle King shown up yet?) ""It's very 'Playboy After Dark,'"" said Al Roker, the television personality who was leaning against a wall enjoying a cocktail. Mr. Thompson kept edging toward the little kitchen, where the chef's equivalent of a jam session was in full swing. Marcus Samuelsson handed him a slice of pickled lotus root topped with Arctic char tartare.

Bill Telepan sweated through his T-shirt, fending off Wylie Dufresne, who snatched a few cubes of potato Mr. Telepan was frying in olive oil to go with slices of dry-aged rib-eye. By virtue of his appetite, his fame and the kind of mind that can keep track of an 80,000-record vinyl collection, Mr. Thompson in the last few years has crept into the white-hot center of a food world that is itself moving toward the center of pop culture. He doesn't cook much himself, although he grew up with a grandmother devoted to Sunday supper. Rather, he aspires to become to food what Gertrude Stein was to art, a culinary catalyst whose parties mix the creative and the powerful against the backdrop of cooking. In these discussions and a book to be released next month, Mr. Thompson continues to mine a favorite topic: the mechanics of creativity.

The job is not all indulgence. His favorite dish at the salon was a South African malva pudding with blood orange sherbet put together by Jessica Koslow of Sqirl in Los Angeles. But ""it was the first time I had sugar in, like, five weeks,"" Mr. Thompson said. He had been on a cleanse, which involved a lot of cabbage soup, in an effort to get his frame under 330 pounds. ""Based on my physical look,"" he said, ""you can tell that food and me have been friends for a long time."" The chefs at the salon said that musicians tend to have terrific appetites, and that the bridge Mr. Thompson is building between food and music makes sense. ""There is no difference between the music you listen to and the food you eat,"" Mr. Samuelsson said. ""The emotions are the same. They are both a narrative.""

Mr. Thompson has been a presenter at James Beard awards ceremonies and has been a ""Top Chef"" judge. He's the guy Chris Rock calls to find out where to eat. His culinary exploits are sent out to his 3.6 million Twitter followers and the 25,000 people who have discovered his Questlovesfood Instagram account. When he spreads his wings over food-related charity events, he can help raise hundreds of thousands of dollars. Anthony Bourdain calls him ""a fully made member of the chef mafia,"" but Mr. Thompson thinks that's overblown. He doesn't want to be another celebrity trying to extend his brand into food. ""I'm very leery of my entry into the fraternity or sorority of these people,"" Mr. Thompson said. In 2013, he opened a little food stand in Chelsea Market with the restaurateur Stephen Starr, who like Mr. Thompson is from Philadelphia. Mr. Thompson is a drummer, so they served fried chicken drumsticks. It was the food version of a rap battle between him and the chef David Chang. The bigger point, though, was to prove he was serious.

""I don't want to be perceived as someone who just bought my way into this world or used my currency as a means to get in,"" Mr. Thompson said in an interview. ""Like, I had to throw them proof."" After seven months, the stand was losing money and closed. ""After the restaurant went down, it was sort of like, 'What should our next move be?'"" he said. So the food salons started. The idea came from something he used to do with the Roots, the neo-soul hip-hop band he founded in 1987 with Tariq Trotter, the musician known as Black Thought. They made their record company add a food budget to pay Philadelphia chefs to prepare meals for social gatherings of musicians.

""We would eat and the musicians would set up and we'd start writing music,"" Mr. Thompson said. That's how the band's breakthrough album, ""Things Fall Apart,"" was born in 1999. His food obsession became more serious in 2009, when the Roots became the house band for ""Late Night With Jimmy Fallon."" (Mr. Thompson and the band have stayed on with Mr. Fallon since he took over ""The Tonight Show"" in 2014.) ""I was counting the pros and the cons of having the 'Late Night' job, and one of the big pros was just the amount of chefs who were at our disposal,"" Mr. Thompson said. ""It was like, 'Oh man, I am eating a sandwich Martha Stewart just brought in.'""

The job has also made it harder to fight his weight. For his birthday in January, cakes poured in from all over. Tastykake even made a delivery. ""They are my kryptonite,"" he said. ""The scariest thing about being here at 30 Rock is that if I mention something, a lifetime supply of it will show up."" The seminal moment in his food education came after he watched the documentary ""Jiro Dreams of Sushi"" and then traveled to the basement of an office tower in Tokyo to eat at the hands of the film's sushi master, Jiro Ono. ""Once I saw his commitment, I realized that I needed to work harder myself,"" he said. The visit led to a book, ""Something to Food About: Exploring Creativity With Innovative Chefs,"" which Clarkson Potter will publish in April. Written with Ben Greenman, co-writer of the Questlove memoir ""Mo' Meta Blues,"" it's based on lengthy interviews with 10 chefs.

The poet Elizabeth Alexander, who seemed surprised and delighted to be at the food salon last month, said she was looking forward to reading the book. She perhaps understood more than others at the party the deep link between cooking and other creative pursuits. Her recent memoir, ""The Light of the World,"" uses food memories and recipes to explore her grief over the sudden loss of her husband, a chef and painter. Chefs, she said in between bites of a baller lettuce cup, are just like any other artists: ""They are obsessive weirdos in the same way.""",The hip-hop musician is becoming a force in the food world.,4b23af26-e4c5-5f1f-b46f-a6fd0366b41b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/09/dining/09QUESTLOVE/09QUESTLOVE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=41915b2b5b11415da5066f9cc447b2f8c45fd60bb85f2ef21fd77fb1022b969d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Questlove holds a food salon in his New York City apartment every few months.,4b23af26-e4c5-5f1f-b46f-a6fd0366b41b,N24News/imgs/4b23af26-e4c5-5f1f-b46f-a6fd0366b41b.jpg,17
Television,"Review: HBO's 'Avenue 5,' a Tale of a Fateful Trip (in Space)",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/17/arts/television/avenue-5-review-hbo.html,"How far is Armando Iannucci's new HBO comedy, ""Avenue 5,"" from his previous one, ""Veep""? About a billion miles, give or take, or the distance from earth to Saturn, where the spaceship of the title is thrown off course, greatly increasing the time its load of unlucky tourists will have to spend on their interplanetary cruise.

Set 40 years in the future aboard a vessel that looks like a cross between the Starship Enterprise and a high-end mall, Iannucci's new show would seem to be a radical departure from the acrid, of-the-moment political satire of ""Veep"" and his earlier British series ""The Thick of It."" (Several of those shows' writers, including Simon Blackwell, Tony Roche and Will Smith, have joined him on ""Avenue 5."")

But there are recognizably Iannuccian things about this space-com, which debuts Sunday. Like the politicians and operatives guiding the ship of state in ""Veep,"" the crew members of the Avenue 5 are an often amoral, small-minded and quarrelsome bunch whose constant sniping provides the bulk of the humor. Leading them is a captain, played by the ""Veep"" alumnus Hugh Laurie, who, like Vice President Selina Meyer, is not ideally qualified for his post.

And there does seem to be satirical intent in ""Avenue 5,"" although one of the show's major problems, through four of the season's nine episodes, is that it's hard to tell what the targets are.","Armando Iannucci's new comedy, starring Hugh Laurie as the captain of an interplanetary cruise ship, is a long, long way from ""Veep.""",fced48d4-b89f-5b4f-b9c2-bd072f6a9ff6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/17/arts/17avenue/17avenue-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=2822b39c62cf4b1077296b1a176e096e1b2ba53f05f3e77b940d3857007f482d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Hugh Laurie plays the captain of an interplanetary cruise ship 40 years in the future in ""Avenue 5,"" Armando Iannucci's first HBO comedy since ""Veep,"" which also featured Laurie.",fced48d4-b89f-5b4f-b9c2-bd072f6a9ff6,N24News/imgs/fced48d4-b89f-5b4f-b9c2-bd072f6a9ff6.jpg,3
Media,'Alternative Facts' and the Costs of Trump-Branded Reality,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/business/media/alternative-facts-trump-brand.html,"When Donald J. Trump swore the presidential oath on Friday, he assumed responsibility not only for the levers of government but also for one of the United States' most valuable assets, battered though it may be: its credibility. The country's sentimental reverence for truth and its jealously guarded press freedoms, while never perfect, have been as important to its global standing as the strength of its military and the reliability of its currency. It's the bedrock of that ""American exceptionalism"" we've heard so much about for so long. Disinformation was for dictatorships, banana republics and failed states. Yet there it was on Saturday, emanating from the lectern of the White House briefing room -- the official microphone of the United States -- as Mr. Trump's press secretary, Sean Spicer, used his first appearance there to put forth easily debunked statistics1 that questioned the news media's reporting on the size of the president's inaugural audience (of all things).

President Trump and his press secretary disputed estimates of attendance at his inauguration, but footage from Friday's event, compared with those from President Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration, showed a different story. SOUNDBITE (English) Sean Spicer, White House Press Secretary: ""This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the globe. Even the New York Times printed a photograph showing that a misrepresentation of the crowd in the original tweet in their paper which showed the full extent of the support, depth, and crowd and intensity that existed. These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong. The president was also at the, as you know, the president was at the Central Intelligence Agency today and greeted by a raucous, overflow crowd of some 400 plus CIA employees. There were over a thousand requests to attend, prompting the president to note that he'll have to come back to greet the rest. The employees were ecstatic that he's the new commander in chief and he delivered them a powerful and important message. He told them he has their back and they were grateful for that. They gave him a five minute standing ovation at the end in a display of their patriotism and their enthusiasm for his presidency. I'd also note that it's a shame that the CIA didn't have a CIA director to be with him today when he visited, because the Democrats have chosen, the Senate Democrats are stalling the nomination of Mike Pompeo and playing politics with national security. That's what you guys should be writing and covering, that this, instead of sewing division about tweets and false narratives. The president is committed to unifying our country and that was the focus of his inaugural address. This kind of dishonesty in the media, the challenging that bringing about our nation together is making it more difficult. There's been a lot of talk in the media about the responsibility to hold Donald Trump accountable. And I'm here to tell you that it goes two ways. We're going to hold the press accountable as well. The American people deserve better, and as long as he serves as the messenger of this incredible movement, he will take his message directly to the American people where his focus will always be."" President Trump and his press secretary disputed estimates of attendance at his inauguration, but footage from Friday's event, compared with those from President Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration, showed a different story.

It was chilling when Mr. Trump's assertion that reporters were ""among the most dishonest people on earth"" became an applause line for the crowd gathered to hear him speak in front of the memorial to fallen agents at C.I.A. headquarters. Still more chilling was when the White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway appeared on ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday to assert that Mr. Spicer's falsehoods were simply ""alternative facts."" Ms. Conway made no bones about what she thought of the news media's ability to debunk those ""alternative facts"" in a way Americans -- especially Trump-loving Americans -- would believe. ""You want to talk provable facts?"" she said to the moderator, Chuck Todd. ""Look -- you've got a 14 percent approval rating in the media, that you've earned. You want to push back on us?"" (She appeared to be referring to a Gallup poll figure related to Republicans' views.)

And really, there it was: an apparent animating principle of Mr. Trump's news media strategy since he first began campaigning. That strategy has consistently presumed that low public opinion of mainstream journalism (which Mr. Trump has been only too happy to help stoke) creates an opening to sell the Trump version of reality, no matter its adherence to the facts. As Mr. Trump and his supporters regularly note, whatever he did during the campaign, it was successful: He won. His most ardent supporters loved the news media bashing. And the complaints and aggressive fact-checking by the news media played right into his hands. He portrayed it as just so much whining and opposition from yet another overprivileged constituency of the Washington establishment. But will tactics that worked in the campaign work in the White House? History is littered with examples of new administrations that quickly found that the techniques that served them well in campaigns did not work well in government. And if they do work, what are the long-term costs to government credibility from tactical ""wins"" that are achieved through the aggressive use of falsehoods? Whatever they are, Mr. Trump should realize that it could hurt his agenda more than anything else.

Mr. McClellan's book chronicles how Mr. Bush staked that credibility on the false rationale for the Iraq invasion -- that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction -- and ultimately lost the confidence of Americans, hobbling him for the rest of his presidency. But the damage wasn't isolated to Mr. Bush's political standing. To this day, the American intelligence community must contend with lingering questions about its own credibility -- to wit, taunts from Moscow (not to mention from Mr. Trump) that assessments pointing to Russian meddling in the presidential election are questionable. After all, wasn't it wrong about Iraq? There's a big difference in importance between the size of Mr. Trump's inaugural audience and the intelligence that led to war, no question. And, as the former Bush White House press secretary Ari Fleischer noted in a conversation with me on Sunday, it's way too early to say whether Mr. Spicer's weekend performance will be the norm. The Trump team's emotions were raw over the weekend, Mr. Fleischer noted, after a mistaken pool report was sent to the rest of the White House press corps, claiming that Mr. Trump had removed a bust of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. from the Oval Office. Zeke Miller, the Time magazine journalist who had written the report, quickly corrected it and apologized when the White House alerted him to the error. ""It rightly leaves the people inside feeling that 'reporters were opposed to us all along for being racist and the first thing they did was imply we were,'"" Mr. Fleischer said. Still, the weekend's events did not arrive in a vacuum. There was the report last week in The Washington Post that the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, known for high standards of accuracy, was selling a commemorative book about Mr. Trump riddled with questionable notions, such as that Hillary Clinton deserved more blame than Mr. Trump did for the so-called birther campaign questioning Mr. Obama's citizenship. (After that report, the museum said it was removing the book pending an investigation into whether it met standards for accuracy.) The administration's decision to eradicate nearly any reference to ""climate change"" on the White House website could be expected given Mr. Trump's promises to overturn his predecessors' climate policies. But it set off concerns among climate scientists that it would extend to valuable government data -- fears that also apply to the sanctity of other administration-controlled data. (Mr. Fleischer, for one, noted that career bureaucrats would blow the whistle on any moves to manipulate government data.)",The falsehoods put forth by members of the Trump team imperil one of the country's most valuable assets: its credibility.,86340d5a-2afc-563a-8b01-ca603eda1b56,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/23/business/23rutenberg-SUB2-jp/23rutenberg-SUB2-jp-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=b7d3b79f6cfa49d98f95e957996364d462bacb1edc5af329ef4279ad5824b2d2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Kellyanne Conway, a Trump adviser, referred to ""alternative facts"" when she appeared on ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday.",86340d5a-2afc-563a-8b01-ca603eda1b56,N24News/imgs/86340d5a-2afc-563a-8b01-ca603eda1b56.jpg,16
Sports,Divergent Paths Bring Rangers and Islanders to Same Postseason Start,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/sports/hockey/new-york-rangers-islanders-playoffs.html,"After a four-month pandemic pause to the N.H.L. season, the Rangers and the Islanders find themselves at the same point -- with a berth in a play-in round in the league's expanded playoffs, which begin this weekend. That did not seem likely way back when the regular season was still in progress, with the two teams going in opposite directions. The Rangers won 12 of 15 games from Jan. 31 to Feb. 27, which vaulted them into the chase for their first playoff berth since 2017. The Islanders had slid into wild-card territory before play was halted on March 12, winning two of their previous 10 games. Those results now amount to ancient history for the rivals, who face each other in an exhibition game on Wednesday in Toronto as they work their way into playoff shape. The 11-seeded Rangers (37-28-5) will play the sixth-seeded Carolina Hurricanes (38-25-5), and the seventh-seeded Islanders (35-23-10) will meet the 10th-seeded Florida Panthers (35-26-8), in best-of-five series that begin Saturday.

What to expect in terms of the caliber of play is anyone's guess in this unusual postseason, but after months of planning for this phased return, Coach Barry Trotz of the Islanders said he thought the first playoff games would be a cathartic, if frenzied, release. ""It probably will be a lot of chaos in that first 10 minutes of Game 1, exciting bad hockey and emotional hockey,'' Trotz said on a conference call with reporters last week. The major challenge now for the 24 playoff teams -- 16 of which are competing in the qualifier round -- will be revving up to postseason-level intensity from the layoff. Teams had two weeks of training camp before traveling to Toronto and Edmonton to acclimate to the playoffs' two host cities. ""It's kind of like trying to jump on a speeding train in a lot of ways,'' Rangers wing Chris Kreider said last week. ""But it's like that for everybody."" The Rangers will rely on Artemi Panarin, a Hart Trophy finalist with 95 points in his first season with the team, and Mika Zibanejad, who scored five of his team-leading 41 goals on March 5.

Coach David Quinn has said he will not name a starting goaltender until Friday or Saturday, when the series starts against the Hurricanes, whom the Rangers defeated four times in the regular season. It seems very likely that Igor Shesterkin, 10-2-0 in his rookie season, will be the team's top goaltender to start the playoffs. But Alexandar Georgiev and Henrik Lundqvist could vie for playing time in a condensed schedule.

For the Islanders, who reached the second round of last season's playoffs, their first year with Trotz behind the bench, the difference between a standard postseason and the new format will be the first hurdle to clear. ""This is going to be a challenge mentally,'' Anders Lee, the Islanders' captain, said. ""Going to a hub city, staying in a hotel and having that bubble and quarantine life -- none of us have been through that. The hockey stuff will fall into place."" Forward Cal Clutterbuck, who recovered from surgery after his left wrist was sliced by a skate blade in December, said the difficulty of the task ahead is apparent. His team will have to win 19 games over five rounds to be champion. The Stanley Cup finals are expected to begin Sept. 20. ""I know for a fact the guys who win the Stanley Cup will feel an immense sense of accomplishment because this, in a lot of ways, is more difficult,'' he said. ""You're trying to get to that level after a standstill of three and a half to four months, and you have to play an extra series. It was already the hardest trophy to win. It just got a little bit harder."" Gary Bettman, the N.H.L. commissioner, said that even bringing these unorthodox playoffs to fruition amid a pandemic was a victory unto itself.","The two teams were going in opposite directions when the N.H.L.'s regular season was halted in mid-March. Both will try to speed into playoff mode, starting with an exhibition game on Wednesday.",6c399b4d-dc0e-568c-8619-060276c637b4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/29/sports/29nhl-islesrangers/29nhl-islesrangers-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a9dd2e05d6fdf7f0453f84d398378e8d1f57de97c7e42579de2e017457d8d21d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Rangers won 12 of 15 games from Jan. 31 to Feb. 27 to vault into the chase for their first playoff berth since 2017.,6c399b4d-dc0e-568c-8619-060276c637b4,N24News/imgs/6c399b4d-dc0e-568c-8619-060276c637b4.jpg,9
Fashion & Style,"Ray Kelvin, Ted Baker C.E.O., Is Accused of Harassment",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/03/fashion/ted-baker-ray-kelvin-sexual-harassment.html,"LONDON -- Current and former employees of the British fashion chain Ted Baker are accusing the company's founder and chief executive of inappropriate behavior, citing a ""forced hugging"" policy and a workplace culture that ""leaves harassment unchallenged."" According to a petition started by Ted Baker employees and published by the employee advocacy group Organise Platform, Ray Kelvin, who started the brand with a single Glasgow shirt shop in 1988, regularly ""tries to massage people around the office, insists on long hugs with staff members, touches them inappropriately and openly asks his staff for sex."" The petition, citing multiple episodes of harassment , also says Ted Baker's human resources department ignored complaints about Mr. Kelvin's behavior. ""Harassment at Ted Baker is well documented but willfully ignored by those in charge,"" write the authors of the petition, which calls for the company to adopt new procedures that allow workers to report harassment to an ""independent, external body.""

It is not clear how many of the more than 2,500 people who have signed the petition are Ted Baker employees because anybody can add their names to it. Shares in the company, which is listed on the FTSE 250, were down 14 percent, a five-year low in midday trading in London on Monday after the existence of the petition became publicized . The company said in a statement that it was taking the allegations cited in the petition ""very seriously,"" and that a ""thorough independent investigation"" would be carried out. ""While the claims made are entirely at odds with the values of our business and those of our C.E.O., we take them very seriously,"" the statement said. It added: ""Ray greets many people he meets with a hug -- be it a shareholder, investor, supplier, partner, customer or colleague. Hugs have become part of Ted Baker's culture, but are absolutely not insisted upon."" Mr. Kelvin named his business after a fictitious alter ego and over three decades built it into one of Britain's best-known fashion brands. In the process, he became one of Britain's most successful, and most eccentric, retail tycoons, worth 522 million pounds ($665 million), according to this year's Sunday Times Rich List.

His love of hugging has been well known for some time; he has talked publicly, and regularly, about fostering ""a hug culture"" in his offices, and of playing matchmaker among his colleagues. He has also been known to make people who are late to meetings do push-ups. And he tries to never show his face in public. ""I am an ugly bugger,"" he told The Daily Telegraph in a 2013 interview, ""I don't want people to see my face. I am not into all that."" The petition, which drew significant interest in the British news media over the weekend, is not the only problem to confront Mr. Kelvin in recent months. In October, Ted Baker rattled investors already spooked by volatility among British retailers when it reported a drop in profit for the six months that ended Aug. 31. The company warned at the time that the second half of the year would ""remain challenging."" Mr. Kelvin is just the latest high-profile fashion industry leader to face public accusations of inappropriate behavior amid a widespread revaluation of workplace culture prompted by the #MeToo movement. In October, it emerged that Philip Green, the British billionaire who is the chairman of Arcadia Group, the retail company whose brands include Topshop, Topman and Miss Selfridge, had used nondisclosure agreements to silence five former employees who had accused him of sexual harassment and racist abuse. In March, Paul Marciano, a founder of Guess, said he was temporarily relinquishing his day-to-day role at the company after the model Kate Upton accused him of groping, harassment, intimidation and firing her from jobs.","A petition started by employees of the European fashion retailer cites multiple episodes of inappropriate behavior by Mr. Kelvin, as well as a workplace culture that ""leaves harassment unchallenged.""",2a078b49-a4b9-5364-aaec-2dde52d6b9f2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/03/world/03tedbaker/03tedbaker-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=3290e0d8c012755b6839e7ea562de18939a9e7b9b7de0e2f7b21d68b3ced0f95&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ray Kelvin, the founder and chief executive of the British fashion chain Ted Baker, is known for trying to keep a low public profile.",2a078b49-a4b9-5364-aaec-2dde52d6b9f2,N24News/imgs/2a078b49-a4b9-5364-aaec-2dde52d6b9f2.jpg,19
Global Business,Obama Finds Oil in Markets Is Sufficient to Sideline Iran,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/31/business/global/obama-to-clear-way-to-expand-iranian-oil-sanctions.html,"WASHINGTON -- After careful analysis of oil prices and months of negotiations, President Obama on Friday determined that there was sufficient oil in world markets to allow countries to significantly reduce their Iranian imports, clearing the way for Washington to impose severe new sanctions intended to slash Iran's oil revenue and press Tehran to abandon its nuclear ambitions. The White House announcement comes after months of back-channel talks to prepare the global energy market to cut Iran out -- but without raising the price of oil, which would benefit Iran and harm the economies of the United States and Europe. Since the sanctions became law in December, administration officials have encouraged oil exporters with spare capacity, particularly Saudi Arabia, to increase their production. They have discussed with Britain and France releasing their oil reserves in the event of a supply disruption. And they have conducted a high-level campaign of shuttle diplomacy to try to persuade other countries, like China, Japan and South Korea, to buy less oil and demand discounts from Iran, in compliance with the sanctions.

The goal is to sap the Iranian government of oil revenue that might go to finance the country's nuclear program. Already, the pending sanctions have led to a decrease in oil exports and a sharp decline in the value of the country's currency, the rial, against the dollar and euro. Administration officials described the Saudis as willing and eager, at least since talks started last fall, to undercut the Iranians. One senior official who had met with the Saudi leadership, said: ""There was no resistance. They are more worried about a nuclear Iran than the Israelis are."" Still officials said, the administration wanted to be sure that the Saudis were not talking a bigger game than they could deliver. The Saudis received a parade of visitors, including some from the Energy Department, to make the case that they had the technical capacity to pump out significantly more oil. But some American officials remain skeptical. That is one reason Mr. Obama left open the option of reviewing this decision every few months. ""We won't know what the Saudis can do until we test it, and we're about to,"" the official said.

Worldwide demand for oil was another critical element of the equation that led to the White House decision on sanctions. Now, projections for demand are lower than expected because of the combination of rising oil prices, the European financial crisis and a modest slowdown in growth in China. As one official said, ""No one wants to wish for slowdown, but demand may be the most important factor."" Nonetheless, the sanctions pose a serious challenge for the United States. Already, concerns over a confrontation with Iran and the loss of its oil -- Iran was the third-biggest exporter of crude in 2010 -- have driven oil prices up about 20 percent this year. A gallon of gas currently costs $3.92, on average, up from about $3.20 a gallon in December. The rising prices have weighed on economic confidence and cut into household budgets, a concern for an Obama administration seeking re-election.

But in a conference call with reporters, senior administration officials said they were confident that they could put the sanctions in effect without damaging the global economy. Iran currently exports about 2.2 million barrels of crude oil a day, according to the economic analysis company IHS Global Insight, and other oil producers will look to make up much of that capacity, as countries buy less and less oil from Iran. A number of countries are producing more petroleum, including the United States itself, which should help to make up the gap. Most notably, Saudi Arabia, the world's single biggest producer, has promised to pump more oil to bring prices down. ""There is no rational reason why oil prices are continuing to remain at these high levels,"" the Saudi oil minister, Ali Naimi, wrote in an opinion article in The Financial Times this week. ""I hope by speaking out on the issue that our intentions -- and capabilities -- are clear,"" he said. ""We want to see stronger European growth and realize that reasonable crude oil prices are key to this."" By certifying that there is enough supply available, the administration is also trying to gain some leverage over Iran before a resumption of negotiations, expected on April 14. The suggestion that Saudi Arabia is prepared to make up for any lost Iranian production is intended to remove Iran's ability to threaten a major disruption in the world oil supply if it does not cede to Western and United Nations demands to halt uranium enrichment. However, administration officials concede that it is unclear how the oil markets will react to Iranian threats even with the president's latest certification that there is sufficient oil to fill the gap.

Media,A Czech Billionaire Buys a Piece of Le Monde,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/26/business/media/daniel-kretinsky-le-monde.html,"PARIS -- Blaise Gauquelin, the Central Europe correspondent for Le Monde, called his editor at the paper's Paris headquarters one day last fall to pass along something of interest: One of the two French businessmen who controlled the 75-year-old daily was selling part of his stake to a Czech billionaire named Daniel Kretinsky. The news sent a tremor through the newsroom of the august national publication. Le Monde's journalists looked into Mr. Kretinsky and noted that he had built his fortune largely on power plants and coal mines across Europe. He also owns part of a pipeline that brings Russian gas through Slovakia to the West. Why would an international energy magnate be interested in an anti-Kremlin newspaper that had invested heavily in covering climate change? Mr. Kretinsky's earlier foray into French media, the purchase of the center-left newsweekly Marianne for 5 million euros last year, contributed to the staff's wariness, given that his first big move was to install the conservative commentator Natacha Polony as editor. Mr. Kretinsky, 43, has had a rapid rise under the tutelage of two of the most successful privatization barons in the post-communist Czech Republic and Slovakia, Patrik Tkac and Petr Kellner. His main business, EPH, comprises more than 50 companies and has annual revenue of 6 billion euros.

With part of his fortune, Mr. Kretinsky bought 49 percent of the stake in Le Monde's parent company held by Matthieu Pigasse, the chief executive of Lazard France. That deal made Mr. Kretinsky the owner of a little more than 13 percent of the paper and its sibling publications. Although Le Monde reported that Mr. Pigasse had initially hoped to sell his entire stake to the Prague energy executive, Mr. Kretinsky said in an interview at the Georges V hotel in Paris that he was content, for now, with his status as a minority owner. ""The idea is to support and to one day be around the table, and have exchanges and talks and debates,"" Mr. Kretinsky said. ""You cannot jump over to Paris for one day a month and believe you can be the sole shareholder of Le Monde. It would be a great pleasure to be there, and if they needed to be supported, that is something we would do with great pleasure."" Mr. Kretinsky, who is fluent in French, said he fell in love with France as a child while watching French films on Czech television. As a young man, he spent a semester studying law at the University of Dijon. Even if he were to become the leader of Le Monde, he said, he would not interfere in the newsroom.

His stake in Le Monde, an afternoon paper with more than 300,000 subscribers, allows him to play a more prominent part in supporting ""trans-Atlantic democracy,"" he said, and to push for greater regulation of Facebook, Google and other internet giants, which, he argued, undermine the free press. ""Being around Le Monde, it's much easier to launch this debate as a real member of the family of French publishers,"" Mr. Kretinsky said. ""The Czech Republic is just too small."" Le Monde's executive editor, Jerome Fenoglio, said that the other two major shareholders, Mr. Pigasse and the internet entrepreneur Xavier Niel, have kept the proper distance from the paper's journalists since taking control of Le Monde Group nine years ago.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Le Monde's reporters and editors had a controlling stake in the paper from its founding in 1944 until it was sold with their approval in 2010, and they still have a say in how it is run. What troubled some in the newsroom about Mr. Kretinsky's entry into the ownership group, the editor added, was the lack of transparency surrounding it. ""The problem is that we heard it through the grapevine, truly the worst way to win our trust,"" Mr. Fenoglio said. ""The condition that would allow us to have confidence in Mr. Kretinsky is simply to agree to our right of approval, and our right to approve or block his ownership in the company. Whoever the new shareholder is, if he loves Le Monde and wants to help it grow, he has to respect its independence."" Alain Beuve-Mery, the editor of Le Monde's economic opinion pages, and the grandson of the newspaper's founder, Hubert Beuve-Mery, noted that Mr. Kretinsky had yet to meet with Le Monde's reporters and editors. ""If the value of a newspaper is its journalists, then, when you buy a newspaper, the first thing you do is you try to win over the journalists,"" Mr. Beuve-Mery said.

Asked what the arrival of Mr. Kretinsky could mean for the paper, Louis Dreyfus, the chief executive of Le Monde Group, responded with a shrug. ""He announced it in October,"" he said. ""We haven't seen any changes in strategy from our shareholders."" Le Monde has made a turnaround in the nine years Mr. Dreyfus has been in charge. He has reduced the size of the back-office and printing staff while increasing the number of journalists at the paper, to 450 from 310. He also started a glossy weekly, M, and a paywalled newsletter, La Matinale. A newly established editing hub in Los Angeles allows for a steady flow of news through the Parisian night, and an online African edition, started in 2015, has given Le Monde a greater presence among the world's 300 million French speakers.

When Mr. Dreyfus arrived, Le Monde had about 140,000 print subscribers and roughly 30,000 digital subscribers. Today, the paper has fewer than 100,000 print subscribers, but more than 200,000 who pay for online access. ""Our strategy for the past nine years has been to keep Le Monde independent,"" Mr. Dreyfus said. ""For that, it's important that it be financially independent."" Before buying the magazine Marianne and the stake in Le Monde, Mr. Kretinsky was already a force in the media business in Prague, where he owns Blesk, a celebrity tabloid. He said he bought it in 2013 to keep it from falling into what he called ""the wrong hands."" ""Blesk is a journal that addresses ordinary people, not the top five or 10 percent of intellectuals, but the mass population, which could be manipulated."" he said. ""So for us, it was a protective measure, a way to make sure that things are going well."" If Czech media outlets had the same guarantee of editorial integrity that Le Monde has, he said with a laugh, ""we wouldn't have to buy them.""","Journalists at the premier daily in France are wary of Daniel Kretinsky, an energy magnate who has bought a stake in the paper's parent company.",50501676-3064-5627-8028-e9dfbd5aca02,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/02/business/27LEMONDE-Kretinsky-sub/27LEMONDE-Kretinsky-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=8dce8609fa56f6b41dd70dca5801477c723f6407de37adedcb46b051ab58c022&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Czech coal and gas magnate Daniel Kretinsky has bought a piece of Le Monde, the 75-year-old French newspaper that was once owned by its employees.",50501676-3064-5627-8028-e9dfbd5aca02,N24News/imgs/50501676-3064-5627-8028-e9dfbd5aca02.jpg,16

Education,Making the Case for More Than Just STEM,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/education/making-the-case-for-more-than-just-stem.html,"One of the most important issues that educators in institutions of higher learning must face is skepticism about the efficacy of liberal arts education in an era that seems to be pushing what educators call STEM -- science, technology, engineering and math -- as the answer to everything. This is not just happening in the United States, of course. Calls to cut support for students who want to study literature, history or other so-called soft disciplines are also made in Europe and Asia.

But on our own shores, just recently, the governor of Connecticut used his line item veto power to cut support for the humanities in the state. While not directly aimed at higher education, this creates a climate in which people who want to study the humanities are told that their interests are worthless. We seem to be rejecting the idea that it is essential for the good health of any society to have people who are broadly educated, who learn to investigate, analyze and present their findings in a logical and clear fashion -- even without the aid of numbers or code.

I was a member of the Commission on the Humanities and Social Sciences, put together by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The report we produced, The Heart of the Matter, discussed this issue in depth, outlining three goals that America's educational institutions should advance:

Educating Americans in the knowledge, skills and understanding that they need to thrive in a 21st century democracy; fostering a society that is innovative, competitive and strong; and equipping the nation for leadership in an interconnected world.

The commission took the position -- and I agree wholeheartedly -- that ""these goals cannot be achieved by science alone.""","The writer says the humanities encourage schoolchildren to solve problems creatively, a skill not fostered solely through science and technology.",1650f71d-8224-589c-b4a0-57995ab1aa2a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/23/education/23ESSAYGORDONREED/23ESSAYGORDONREED-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=530&w=1012&s=bae94d7c816b7f11dafb1275e3a87fc5bb115c671b2368c6f6f393e63c058f64&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Annette Gordon-Reed,1650f71d-8224-589c-b4a0-57995ab1aa2a,N24News/imgs/1650f71d-8224-589c-b4a0-57995ab1aa2a.jpg,22
Science,"In Defense of Sea Gulls: They're Smart, and They Co-Parent, 50/50 All the Way",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/science/seagulls-behavior.html,"In Defense of Sea Gulls: They're Smart, and They Co-Parent, 50/50 All the Way

Here are three good things about gulls: Males share child care equally with females. That includes sitting on the eggs during incubation. And they have figured out a way -- actually many ways -- to survive in a harsh and unforgiving world. Some eat clams, some eat fish, some are attracted to landfills. Of course , a few will divebomb you at the beach or boardwalk to steal a French fry, or the cheese on your cracker, or an entire slice of pizza. The beach pirate approach to survival is, of course, where humans and gulls clash. And the outcry from humans is almost as loud and outraged as the cries of the gulls themselves. Several recent news articles have chronicled the predations of gulls and some possible remedies.

There are more than 100 species of gulls worldwide, and they are doing well, by and large. Some live nowhere near the sea, which makes birders and ornithologists allergic to the common term sea gull, although renegade friends of common language have called this attitude ""birdsplaining."" A few, like the Ivory gull in the Arctic, which is near threatened, and the black-billed gull in New Zealand, which is endangered, are in trouble, but most are not. The gulls that people are most likely to encounter on Northeastern beaches in August are herring gulls, great black-backed gulls, ring-billed gulls and laughing gulls. Some of their populations are declining, but that is probably because they reached historic highs in the 20th century. Before that time, some of those gulls were not found in New York or New Jersey. Herring gulls were first spotted nesting on Long Island in 1931, for instance. They began to spread in the 1960s and peaked in the '80s.

Dr. Elphick said, and ornithologists and birders speculate, that the closing of open landfills like Fresh Kills on Staten Island may have something to do with the drop in numbers since then. ""There's many a birder, especially those who've been around for 20 to 30 years, who will complain about the closing of landfills and how it's removed their best places to go watch gulls,"" he said. Dr. Sarah J. Courchesne has been part of a summer gull research program at the Shoals Marine Laboratory on Appledore Island, Me., since 2008. She admits that the herring gulls and black-backed gulls there do not always take kindly to visitors. But these are breeding colonies, and the researchers take young birds off the nest, examine them and put identification bands on them. ""This is like somebody walked into your house in the night and picked up your child and tried to walk off with them,"" she said. ""You would be alarmed."" As are the gulls. So much so that the volunteers wear bike helmets and sometimes ponchos. Gull poop can ruin a shirt. ""Some gulls are just kind of psycho and others are really chill,"" she said. Some birds sit quietly on a nest and allow themselves to be lifted off by volunteers who check the babies.

And the same variation occurs in how any given gull makes a living. Thousands and thousands forage for clams, follow fishing boats and shop at the local landfills. ""We have gulls that are never seen on beaches and we know that because we have GPS loggers on them and they just never go near people,"" Dr. Courchesne said . ""They are 100 percent out at sea fishing for their own food."" ""I can't deny that there are gulls that are stealing food,"" she added. ""And I can't deny they are really good at it."" But the thieves are specialists. And to give credit where it is due, they have worked at their trade. ""If you're dealing with a gull that is really talented at stealing food,"" Dr. Courchesne said, ""that gull has perfected the technique, possibly over the course of years.""

Also, the behavior that bothers humans so much begins with humans themselves. ""Everybody who goes to the beach and gets aggravated by a gull has previous humans to thank for it,"" Dr. Courchesne said. You may not have given the gulls food, but somebody else did, and gulls are fast learners. At nearby beaches on the mainland, she said, ""You'll see people drive up to the beach and they'll just dump an entire container of French fries out their window so the gulls come.""

Dr. Elphick agreed. ""We're slobs,"" he said. ""If we didn't leave food lying around, they wouldn't be doing what they're doing."" Dr. Courchesne, a veterinarian, teaches biology at Northern Essex Community College as well as being one of the leaders of the gull program at Appledore. (Her students often volunteer for the gull program.) She came to gulls partly because she loved birds, and even in veterinary school she knew she would not be treating pets. ""I don't like dogs,"" she said. She often hears from the public, since a major part of the research at Appledore involves banding young gulls and getting reports about where they turn up. She tries to turn correspondents into gull admirers or, at least, gull tolerators. ""People say, so here's a bird, it tried to steal my sandwich. It has a band on it so I guess you want to hear about it,"" she said. ""We'll tell them the whole history. Some of these birds are 12 to 15 years old."" She tells them how many offspring they have and what devoted parents they are, and how the ""mother"" that they saw may well have been a male helping his young. Late August is ""high time for harassment,"" she said, because the young have fledged and their adult parents take them to foraging spots, which include beaches and boardwalks, to find food and to teach them the ropes. The gulls, like the humans, bring their whole families. ""They're being so pushy for food because they're such committed parents,"" she said. ""I have really come to love them,"" she said. ""They're my favorite birds. They're so scrappy and they're overlooked.""

What does she recommend that the public do about gulls? ""I would recommend to people that they spend some time just bird watching,"" Dr. Courchesne said. ""Sit back and watch what they do."" ""If you give them a little time and devote your attention to them you will see this great intelligence behind that eye and this caginess, and this generalist sensibility that I think is very relatable to a human,"" she said. ""Because it's kind of the same way we go through the world.""","Besides, if people weren't such slobs, gulls would never have learned about French fries.",7e4212bb-f4d8-57ea-80d6-a606483152da,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/27/science/00SCI-GULLS1/00SCI-GULLS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=a7d1e0c2bffd67ee50c3ff2d15428e2541e1308a3b56d1c848cf4b81c7b0cb6d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,This gull contains multitudes.,7e4212bb-f4d8-57ea-80d6-a606483152da,N24News/imgs/7e4212bb-f4d8-57ea-80d6-a606483152da.jpg,2
Art & Design,A Diary From a Gulag Meets Evil With Lightness,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/arts/design/gulag-museum-moscow-diary.html,"MOSCOW -- For nearly 70 years, Olga M. Ranitskaya's exceptional palm-sized diary, bound in snakeskin, slumbered in obscurity. Combining whimsical drawings with clever rhyming couplets, the diary -- more graphic novel than ordinary journal -- portrays the physical and emotional hardships of a spirited stick figure, the author's alter ego. What makes this diary unique is that Ms. Ranitskaya created it while incarcerated in the Gulag, the Soviet system of forced labor camps where, at its height, Joseph Stalin imprisoned millions of people from the 1930s to the 1950s. The Gulag inspired famous literary accounts, such as the works by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Varlam Shalamov, but they were all written after the authors were released. Ms. Ranitskaya's diary is believed to be the only one written inside the camps to have survived. How the diary emerged reads like a detective story, with Zoya Eroshok, a prominent Russian journalist, spending years piecing together the identity of its author and her fate. The saga is the subject of the new exhibition ""Evidence: Little Book,"" which runs through Feb. 8 at the Gulag History Museum in Moscow.

The exhibition arrives as Russia stands at a crossroads in its attitude toward the darker reaches of its recent history. The government just unveiled the first national monument to the victims of political repression, and the revitalized Gulag History Museum, which moved to a larger building in 2015, has been recording the recollections of remaining survivors. But attitudes toward Stalin and his terror have become far more tolerant, not least because the Kremlin has recast his time as head of the Soviet Union with a certain nostalgia. President Vladimir V. Putin does not deny Stalin's repressions, but there has been a new emphasis on his legacy as an ""efficient manager."" Organizers of the exhibition consider the diary so important because it puts a human face on past crimes. Getting caught with a pen and paper in the Gulag was sufficient grounds for execution. Keeping a diary was ""particularly impossible,"" said Irina S. Ostrovskaya, the senior archivist at Memorial, the Russian civil rights organization founded to establish a record of the victims of Soviet political repression.

The author began the diary in 1941 -- the date written on the first page -- while she was working at a weather station that served the farming operations of the sprawling Karlag labor camp in Kazakhstan. The diary features the misadventures of camp life experienced by the stick figure called the ""Little Weather Devil."" Drawn in the style of pre-revolutionary comics, each page depicts a theme, like hunger or fear, or illustrates specific, often emotional moments, from the tragedy of losing a coat in a harsh climate to the joy of finding a she-wolf for a pet. On some pages, the figure contemplates existential questions or the vagaries of fate. The diary frequently references Russian literature, including the poets Pushkin and Lermontov, as well as Latin axioms. The title of the diary, ""Work and Days,"" came from the epic poem of Hesiod, a Greek poet, from around 700 BC, which discussed corruption, honesty and justice. The couplets are difficult to translate, particularly the more philosophical musings. They are often word plays or otherwise ambiguous. ""It reveals a very good knowledge of the language and literature, but it is often hard to tell what she means,"" said Dmitri A. Belanovsky, who translated parts of the diary into English. He thinks the ambiguity was insurance in case the guards found the diary.

The Gulag History Museum published a copy of the diary in a small, handsome volume that also includes reproductions of newspaper articles about its discovery, the record of Ms. Ranitskaya's interrogation when she was arrested and some longer poems that she wrote later. It took some eight years to pull it all together. In February 2009, Ms. Eroshok, a founding editor of Novaya Gazeta, a liberal newspaper, received the diary from a woman in Siberia whose own mother had spirited it out of the camp in 1946. The only thing the woman remembered being told about the book was that it had been written by a woman named Olga, that she might have worked at the weather station and that she probably died in late 1942, when the diary ended.

Ms. Eroshok found the diary stunning and wondered about its author. ""She responded to this evil with something of quality, the quality of the drawing, the quality of the language and the quality of strong and positive feelings: her love for her son, her love of life, her love for people,"" said Ms. Eroshok. ""I had this deep sense of responsibility that I had to find something out about this woman, tell her story somehow."" The journalist thumbed through the tiny volume repeatedly, seeking clues. The author had dedicated the diary to her son, Sasha. Maybe he was still alive? The diary's first entry shows the stick figure sitting atop a weather station, staring out over the fields. The words suggest the figure is yearning for distant Ukraine. Did Sasha live in Ukraine?

Another page contained a list of six weather station employees. Only one was female, Ranitskaya. (In Russian, a surname often reveals a person's gender.) Could that be Olga? Ms. Eroshok wrote to the archives of 15 different secret police agencies, courts and other organizations in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, requesting information about one Olga Ranitskaya. The central archives wrote back that they had no information. Her quest was a typical example of how difficult it can be to verify information about the victims of Soviet brutality. Frustrated, she wrote an article in Novaya Gazeta about her hunt, and clues trickled in. She got lucky. In Israel, Inna A. Nogotovich, a Russian immigrant occasionally nostalgic for home culture, read the article by chance and got in touch with Ms Eroshok. Ms. Nogotovich was Ms. Ranitskaya's niece, and she filled in many blanks. Then Ms. Eroshok heard from an even more unexpected quarter. Vasily Khristoforov, then head of the notoriously secretive archives of the F.S.B., or Federal Security Service, the successor agency to the Soviet secret police, offered to help. He contacted several security agency archives, including one in Ukraine, and obtained the records of Ms. Ranitskaya's interrogation after her arrest. From this, Ms. Eroshok was able to piece the story together. Ms. Ranitskaya was a Ukrainian Jew born in Kiev in 1905 to two professionals. The family name was Rabinovich, which she eventually changed. Ending her education early, she married a Communist Party official and had a son, Sasha, in 1925. She divorced and married another party official.

Mr. Romanov believes that Russia must get past the arguments over how many millions Stalin killed and focus instead on the fate of ordinary people. ""This is a game with abstract terms,"" he said, ""What is important is to return to people's fate and allow the viewers to be part of someone's life."" For Ms. Eroshok, the book is testament to Ms. Ranitskaya outliving the system that sought to erase her. She has managed to rescue herself from oblivion, Ms. Eroshok said, and the diary is not just evidence, but a form of revenge against Stalin for all his victims. ""He wanted them to be wiped off the face of the earth,"" she said. ""Well, now he is gone, but this book remains.""","A unique chronicle written from the Gulag emerged after 70 years, requiring dogged detective work to unearth the author's identity.",3c770b5e-71ac-578f-bd97-6f3a1e9c0ed1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/04/arts/04gulag1/14gulag1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=0de944905777e6d32b8fbb6b3c8deb568feb2130197134c3931a1c5e88c6c4ce&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The journalist Zoya Eroshok in the Gulag History Museum in Moscow.

Technology,"London Lab Advances Use of A.I. in Health Care, but Raises Privacy Concerns",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/31/technology/deepmind-artificial-intelligence-health-care.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Each year, one out of every five patients admitted to a hospital in the United States for serious care develops acute kidney injury. For a variety of reasons, these patients' kidneys suddenly stop functioning normally and become unable to properly remove toxins from the bloodstream. The condition can permanently damage the kidneys, cause other illnesses or even lead to death. Acute kidney disease, or A.K.I., contributes to nearly 300,000 deaths in the United States each year, according to a 2016 study. But if the condition is identified in its early stages and properly treated, it can be stopped or reversed. In a paper published on Wednesday in the science journal Nature, researchers from DeepMind, a London artificial intelligence lab owned by Google's parent company, detail a system that can analyze a patient's health records, including blood tests, vital signs and past medical history, and predict A.K.I. up to 48 hours before onset.

The paper is part of widespread efforts to build technology that can automatically diagnose or predict illness and disease, from diabetic blindness to meningitis to cancer. In academia and industry, particularly at companies like Google and DeepMind, researchers are rapidly improving this new type of automated health care. But there are many questions regarding the research, especially when it involves big corporate labs. To build and improve their automated systems, such labs must acquire vast amounts of patient data from hospitals and other medical institutions. That has repeatedly raised concerns over patient privacy. In 2017, a British government watchdog agency ruled that DeepMind had violated patient privacy in acquiring medical records from the country's National Health Service. In November, after saying that it would not share such data with Google, the London lab said it was transferring the unit that acquired the records to the American technology giant, prompting complaints from privacy advocates in Britain and elsewhere. With Google, privacy concerns are heightened because the company already controls so much data describing what people do online.

DeepMind's new research is based on what is called a neural network, a complex mathematical system that can learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. By analyzing thousands of dog photos, for instance, a neural network can learn to recognize a dog. Tech giants like Google already use such technology to recognize faces in photos, identify spoken words and translate languages on popular internet services and consumer devices. Now, researchers are applying the idea to health care. In the new paper, DeepMind researchers describe a system that learns to predict acute kidney injury by identifying patterns in over 700,000 patient records from the Department of Veterans Affairs. The system was reasonably accurate with its predictions, but it still missed almost half of the cases of A.K.I. ""This perhaps points at the need to look into other data sources that may paint a more complete picture of the patient's clinical reality,"" said Dr. L. Nelson Sanchez-Pinto, a researcher at Northwestern University who was not involved in the DeepMind paper but is exploring similar technology. Because the system learns from the medical history of mostly male patients admitted to V.A. hospitals, it is also unclear how well the technology would work when used with patients outside that particular population. As Dr. Sanchez-Pinto indicated, the system could be improved with more, and more varied, data. But that is where DeepMind and Google are running into problems.",DeepMind is at the forefront of bringing artificial intelligence to health care.

Style,The Milk Situation,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/style/milk-dairy-marketing.html,"Credit...Brett Carlsen for The New York Times





For two fleeting decades, there was no status symbol more potent than the milk mustache. ""Got Milk?"" stretched across nearly 350 print advertisements and more than 70 television commercials featuring some of the most famous people in America: Beyonce and Tina Knowles. Serena and Venus Williams. Harrison Ford. Angelina Jolie. Alex Trebek. Rihanna. Taylor Swift. Readers of a certain age may remember the way the print ads hung, on thin and crinkly magazine pages, from their friends' bedroom walls. Those of a slightly younger age may have worn bibs that carried the slogan. ""The campaign was very brilliant, and very adorable,"" said Faith Popcorn, a marketing consultant and self-proclaimed futurist. ""It took an unbranded product and made it very special. Seeing celebrities with a little mustache on makes it very infantile and funny and warm."" What the ads didn't do was convince people to buy milk. In 1996, three years after the campaign's debut, Americans were drinking, on average, about 24 gallons of milk a year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In 2018, that number was down to 17 gallons. (Meanwhile, thanks to yogurt and cheese, dairy consumption per capita is way up.)

But the mustache isn't milk at all: It's an oat beverage sold by Chobani, the company that made Greek yogurt cool in the 2010s. And it's a sign of the times. While nondairy milk has risen from the dusty shelves of health-food stores to Times Square billboards and supermarkets around the country, dairy farmers have faced economic turmoil. The question now is not whether anyone's got milk. It's how to sell it. Our Milk, Our Selves Many people view milk as a distinctly American product. Its primary consumers, in cities and suburbs, picture their gallons of two percent coming from rural idylls in upstate New York, Wisconsin and Idaho, where cows serenely graze and farmers procure their milk by hand.

Despite their apparent attachment to milk, Americans are fairly disconnected from its agricultural underpinnings. In an online survey by the Innovation Center of U.S. Dairy, seven percent of respondents said they believed that chocolate milk comes from ... brown cows. Despite the quaint imagery many people still associate with milk's creation, almost all of it is produced at a factory scale. The largest dairy farms house thousands of cows, who are repeatedly impregnated (often by artificial insemination) so they can make milk nearly year-round. Even with a set price, Americans still aren't buying milk in the volume farmers say they need to turn a profit. Since 1975, milk consumption per capita has dipped roughly 40 percent, according to data from Nielsen, and between 2010 and 2018, sales of milk dropped by 13 percent. The already-low price of milk, which is set by the federal government, is projected to drop even further this year.

As the new coronavirus has given rise to a global pandemic, and plenty of panic shopping for household staples and items with long shelf lives, demand for oat milk has soared, according to Nielsen. 'Clean eating"" -- a catchall phrase for a mostly plant-based diet free of processed foods -- has become the North Star for many Americans looking to balance their desire for health with a desire to be thin, dairy has been branded as ""unclean."" Joaquin Phoenix dedicated an entire Oscars speech to its supposed cruelty. The party line in women's media is that giving up dairy will clear your acne, make you less bloated and bestow upon you the glow and energy of Gwyneth Paltrow. (Elsewhere, people are applying it topically to soften and smooth their skin.) ""We've done a poor job of explaining the nutritional value of milk,"" said H.H. Barlow, the executive director of the Kentucky Dairy Development Council. ""And we've done a poor job of innovation in selling our products. We're still selling milk in that plain, simple gallon jug."" The types of milk that are selling these days are the grass-fed, organic ""specialty"" milks that turn the dairy case more colorful. Consider the average American dairy case: Its heart is a sea of neutral plastic jugs, which are as visually exciting as a drawer full of worn-out socks. Things get louder and more colorful once your focus moves to the organic shelves -- and then even more so once the dairy gives way to the sparkle of almond, oat and soy milk.

Elmhurst 1925, formerly Elmhurst Dairy, has turned what was New York City's last milk processing plant into a company that ""milks"" things like oats, hemp seeds and almonds. Henry Schwartz, the owner of Elmhurst Dairy, closed the plant in 2016, citing an unprofitable business. Soon, in a moment of entrepreneurial kismet, he met Dr. Cheryl Mitchell. Dr. Mitchell is a food scientist who, at the time, had recently developed a process that can break down things like nuts, seeds and grains into their smallest particles -- separating stubborn fiber from protein, say -- and produce a smooth, creamy drink. Mr. Schwartz bought up Ms. Mitchell's patents, hired her as his lead food scientist, and reintroduced Elmhurst Dairy as Elmhurst 1925, a dairy-free beverage company. The company started out with four styles of lightly sweetened ""milked nuts"": almond, cashew, hazelnut and walnut. Now, they have 18 varieties and will begin selling coffee creamers this spring. Elmhurst arrived on the coattails of Oatly's American debut. The Swedish oat milk brand, with its irreverent ad campaigns and its full court press on third-wave coffee shops, helped revitalize the dairy-alternative category. The plant-based milk industry saw $2 billion in sales last year, according to the Good Food Institute and the Plant Based Foods Association. ""Plant-based milk is really crossing over to people who are open to trying different things in their diet, whether or not that's because of health concerns,"" said Peter Truby, Elmhurst's C.M.O. ""They want to try it because they think it might taste good. We have Oatly to thank for some of that. Impossible Foods has done a lot for that."" While almond milk is still the No. 1 seller in the category, Mr. Truby expects oat will surpass it eventually. But he's also betting on fatty, nutty hemp seeds, which Elmhurst has begun whizzing into their coffee creamers for added fat.

""If anything deserves to have its day, I think it's hemp,"" Mr. Truby said, noting the plant's sustainability. (Its byproducts can be used to make clothing and building materials, and it's a fast-growing, regenerative crop.) Sustainability and climate impact have become enormous factors in the way people talk about and purchase dairy milk and its substitutes. According to Helen Harwatt, a food and climate policy fellow at Harvard, ""dairy is the second highest emitting livestock product, accounting for 4 percent of all global emissions."" (Beef, which happens to come from the same animal as dairy, is No. 1, responsible for 6 percent of emissions.) Farming almonds for almond milk, Dr. Harwatt said, is ""much less"" harmful to the environment, as animals require food to produce food. She pointed to a study by Joseph Poore in 2018, which found that almond milk takes half as much water to make than the same amount of dairy, and produces a quarter of the emissions. But dairy farmers take issue with these environmental condemnations. ""I think dairy farmers are some of the country's best environmentalists,"" said Mr. Barlow, of the Kentucky Dairy Development Council. For him, it's a matter of using the land for its designated purpose: to feed the world. ""You hear people say, 'Let's don't have the cows in barns.' But one acre of corn silage will feed a cow all year long. And if she's grazing, there's no way that can take place.""

In an industry that has become increasingly bleak, Chaney's Dairy Barn is a success story born of desperation. Carl Chaney and his family have turned what was recently a foundering dairy business out of Bowling Green, Ky., into a tourist attraction that grosses over a million dollars a year. Mr. Chaney, a second-generation dairy farmer, remembers coming to an impasse with his father, James, in 2000. ""We had some rough prices,"" Mr. Chaney said of that year. He recalled his father saying, ""I made more money milking cows in 1943 than I am now."" The Chaneys's solution to the problem was more investment -- but instead of buying state-of-the-art milking machinery, they opened an ice cream shop and a restaurant, and opened the farm for tours, the sort where small children can hitch a ride on a large tractor. Agritourism of this sort has become a secondary, and sometimes primary, form of revenue for many small farms -- which is to say, the vast majority of farms in America. They're opening their homes for farm stays on Airbnb and renting out land on Hipcamp. They're hosting tours and classes for urbanites who view their professions as picturesque pastimes. For many farmers, turning their land into a destination has been life sustaining. ""The dairy barn is what has kept the cows here on the farm,"" Mr. Chaney said. ""If it was not for selling ice cream, and a restaurant, and tours, and taking our trailers out off-site to sell ice cream, we would have sold the cows. We lose money milking cows.""

Consumer education is a necessity for the alternative and premium milk sector: Americans are drinking less dairy milk, but it's still the product they're most familiar with. For A2, a New Zealand-based dairy company that sells milk that's free of the A1 protein that many people find difficult to digest, health benefits are a way into the fast-growing but hypercompetitive alternative-dairy market. Milk, said Blake Waltrip, the chief executive of A2, is a ""repertoire purchasing category"": The average consumer has three to four different types of milk or milk alternatives in their rotation. As far as they're concerned, it's all just milk. Which means that these companies need to constantly be innovating to recapture consumers' interests. For A2, health benefits are an easy sell. ""People care more about what the product does for them than about getting deep into the science,"" said Mr. Waltrip. In Australia, A2 accounts for 11 percent of all milk sales, and the company claims that 70 percent of their consumers have no milk intolerance at all. Mr. Waltrip believes it's because theirs is a ""better milk,"" but it also may be that consumers, long confused about whether or not dairy milk is good for them, are relieved to have a ""healthy"" dairy milk to buy. Finding new ways to market and process milk has become essential for dairy farmers looking to turn things around. But some are thinking of making bigger changes to their production.

Real Estate,New Apartments in the Suburbs Attract New Yorkers,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/realestate/suburbs-attract-new-yorkers.html,"One third of all residents who moved in June to Allure, a new rental building in Stamford, Conn., came from New York City. ""People aren't exactly sure where they want to be long term,"" said Ted Ferrarone, co-president of the developer. ""This is much less of a commitment than a house or condo.""





Some New Yorkers who have moved out of the city since the beginning of the pandemic headed to the suburbs, but not to a typical suburban life. Instead of a house with a picket fence and a front yard, many urbanites have opted to rent in newly developed apartment buildings or to buy condominiums in denser, walkable suburban communities, where apartments tend to be bigger and offer more outdoor space than comparable units in the city. The increased traffic from city dwellers surprised developers at first, but it quickly became clear that many New Yorkers were hoping to secure what they felt would be a safer, short-term future outside the borders of the city. ""Back in April, the narrative of this outbound migration to the suburbs was anecdotal,"" said James Fitzpatrick, division president for luxury home builder Toll Brothers. ""But over the past three months, that's now become real and measurable for us."" Sales on single-family homes in the suburbs spiked when the pandemic began in March. Many families fled New York in search of temporary rental homes or permanent second homes where parents could work remotely, children could attend online classes and everyone could enjoy the summer with sufficient social distancing. New Yorkers who chose to leave the city for a new apartment or condominium, however, had different priorities, namely an affordable and active lifestyle -- two things that a locked-down New York no longer offered.

""Affordability became paramount almost overnight,"" said Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers & Consultants. ""Covid-19 removed, in the short term, a lot of the things in New York that make it the reason to be there."" Nowhere is this shift more visible than in the suburbs of northeastern New Jersey. Until the pandemic, Hudson County, which includes Hoboken and Jersey City, was the top-performing real estate market in the state, according to Jeffrey Otteau, president and founder of Otteau Group, a real estate analytics and appraisal firm. But demand for condos, a popular market in this part of New Jersey, dropped by 13 percent from January through August of this year. The rental market there also suffered as people moved farther out into the state. Now, there are over 1,300 fewer occupied apartments in the area. The rental market just beyond Hudson County, however, is a different story. Across the state's 19 more suburban counties, new apartment complexes have popped up to take on demand. Next door in Essex County, PEEK Properties is opening a 39-unit rental complex at 475 William Street in downtown East Orange. In the two weeks since launching the property's leasing website, the developer has received over 50 inquiries from prospective tenants, with 60 percent of them coming from New York.

Mrs. Lambert described the decision as their most logical move for the time being. They plan to relocate permanently to their second home in New Orleans in about five years. ""When we were deciding to leave the city it didn't seem like we wanted to live in some random community,"" she said. ""Maplewood felt like coming home."" At Quin Sleepy Hollow, a building in JMF Properties' portfolio that opened last November in Plainfield, N.J., an average of 12 apartments leased from March to July, but the number jumped to 20 leases in August, and more than a third of the new tenants were New Yorkers. Seventeen miles north in Bergen County, BNE Real Estate Group two weeks ago started leasing at One500, a 228-unit luxury rental. Thirty-four percent of the newly signed leases have gone to former New York residents. Benji and Arielle Klein are moving to a two-bedroom apartment at One500 this week from their 600-square-foot spot on the Upper West Side. A handful of their New York friends signed leases in the building as well. ""I'm honestly sad to leave the city, but it does help that our friends are there and we'll have a balcony,"" said Mrs. Klein. ""We are paying much less for almost double the space.""

Suburban condominiums like the Brownstones at Edge-on-Hudson in Sleepy Hollow have seen a boost in sales since June as well. Mr. Fitzpatrick of Toll Brothers said they have sold 46 of the 72 new townhomes to date, with about 65 percent of new residents coming from the five boroughs. Straight east and situated on Long Island Sound in Stamford, Conn., Harbor Point -- an 11-building, 3,400-unit development -- has welcomed scores of New Yorkers to its newest tower, Allure, in the last few months. Since June, 188 new leases have been signed, according to Ted Ferrarone, co-president of the site's developer, Building and Land Technology, and about 35 percent of the residents who moved into the building in June came from New York. Three more buildings are under construction in the development. ""The pandemic has turned into a real driver of demand,"" he said. ""Interest across all our properties slowed for about three weeks at first, but then traffic really ramped up."" Erika Colon, a headhunter for Covid-19 nurses and the owner of her own recruiting agency, moved to Allure in May after seven years in a 400-square-foot East Village studio apartment. Without a proper desk to work from, she often made phone calls from her bed during the pandemic. Ms. Colon, who is originally from Stamford, now lives in a one-bedroom, corner unit with ample space and a waterfront-facing balcony. She said she now has enough room to breathe and focus on work. ""Sometimes you have to do something to make sure you feel comfortable from a mental health standpoint,"" she said. ""New York will always be there. It's just a train ride away.""

Fashion & Style,"At Paris Fashion Week, Who's Got the Power?",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/fashion/paris-fashion-week-dior-lanvin-ysl-valentino.html,"PARIS -- This week marks the ascension of four new designers at four vaunted houses: Anthony Vaccarello at Yves Saint Laurent, Bouchra Jarrar at Lanvin, Maria Grazia Chiuri at Christian Dior and Pierpaolo Piccioli, solo for the first time, at Valentino. It could produce, potentially, the biggest single aesthetic shift in seasons. Not just because new designers tend to mean new looks, and these brands are so dominant that new looks on their runways will filter down into new looks far beyond their own doors (and at price points far different). But because these designers -- as well as Raf Simons, newly installed as chief creative officer at Calvin Klein in New York, whose debut comes next season -- have a level of control over their work that will greatly amplify their message. After a period in which the brand was consciously prioritized over the creative, and designers' reach increasingly curtailed, so that they might be (like Mr. Simons in his former post at Dior) responsible simply for the women's wear on the catwalk, with advertising and store environments and celebrity ambassadors and so on dictated by a separate team answerable to management, the pendulum began to swing back and has been picking up momentum. Executives might want to duck, so it doesn't whack them on the way. Ms. Chiuri, for example, will weigh in on not only products, but image, ads and stores, responsibilities that Sidney Toledano, Dior chief executive, admitted at her appointment were more expansive than those of her predecessor. Mr. Simons will, for the first time since Calvin Klein himself left the brand in 2003, have creative say over every single aspect of that brand: men's and women's runway, jeans, underwear, fragrance and home. Mr. Vaccarello will, like Hedi Slimane before him, have oversight not only of clothes for both men and women but also accessories, image, advertising and store design. Ditto Mr. Piccioli.

The avidity with which their debuts will be watched suggests one conclusion: The era of the brand caretaker is over. The star designer is back. You could say this is only to be expected. Fashion does one thing, then it does another. Hemlines go up, then they go down. It's natural law: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. But the rationale behind the reversal is not quite so simple, and its implications, for everyone involved, including the woman in the store searching for a nice dress, are significant. Once upon a fashion time, designers dictated the look of their brands, writ large: Christian Dior chose not only his silhouettes but the dove gray shades of his walls and chairs. Yves Saint Laurent posed naked in his own advertisements. La maison, c'est moi was the message, and the reality. When the designer evolved into the creative director in the era of Tom Ford's Gucci reign at the end of the 20th century, it was a specific acknowledgment of not only the globalization of brands, but the extent of Mr. Ford's dominance over all the visual and emotional touch points between brand and consumer, and the need to have a single presiding imagination ensuring coherence across the whole. But Mr. Ford and his partner on the business side, Domenico de Sole, were neither brand founders nor brand owners. And after they convinced the conglomerate then known as PPR (now Kering) to buy Gucci (to save them from that other conglomerate, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton), a public power struggle ensued that ultimately saw the designer and the chief executive walk away from what they had wrought.

The following breast-beating within the industry -- how would Gucci survive without them! Oh, woe is us! etc. etc. -- convinced everyone that handing authority to the creative side to the extent that they became synonymous with their house was dangerous as they could just leave. The safest way to proceed would be to make the designer serve the brand, not the other way around. Designers (at least the majority of them; a select few, such as Karl Lagerfeld, remained a world unto themselves) became ""work for hire,"" seemingly regarded as practically interchangeable by their employers: Shirts not selling? Get rid of X; hire Y! When critics complained about the resulting aesthetic whiplash, executives would shake their heads and accuse them (O.K., me) of myopia; customers, they said, had no idea.

At least that's that they said until 2008, when LVMH handed the reins of Celine to Phoebe Philo, who rejected any lip service to ""brand DNA"" and washed the company's Aegean stables clean. Overnight the products created by the former designer Ivana Omazic were removed from the stores and Ms. Philo remade the brand in her image. It worked. Little wonder that that move was followed four years later by an even more public reimagining of Yves Saint Laurent under Mr. Slimane, who not only renamed the ready-to-wear Saint Laurent -- instead of Yves Saint Laurent -- but famously designed everything down to the furniture in the stores, and photographed the ad campaigns. Then, in 2013, Jonathan Anderson took over at Loewe, and likewise remade the logo, the stores, the show space and the products. And last year Alessandro Michele got the top job at Gucci, and -- well, we all know what's going on there. Each time, sales went up, and buzz went wild. All taken as proof positive of the payoff that can result from allowing a single imagination to create a coherent universe, especially at a time when consumer habits were changing, and people were getting more picky about what they bought. For a brand to speak with authority, a designer actually needs authority.

As a result, designers once again have the upper hand. They have proved their value, can demand their due, and increasingly are. But this time around, unlike the last time, they are doing it while thinking of themselves -- not as divas, but as free agents. And that means, if they don't get what they want, they walk. When Mr. Ford left it was with a wrench and a moan (during his last Gucci collection, roses fell from the ceiling, and at YSL, which he had been designing since Gucci bought the brand in 1999, the audience was in tears). Now departures are so common, the news gets leaked months beforehand, and everyone shrugs and moves on. But if that happens, as it has at YSL, with Mr. Slimane taking his leave after three years, and one complete reinvention of a brand is followed by another reinvention of the brand (we'll see what Mr. Vaccarello does, but the images released thus far suggest he's interested in starting afresh), it's a recipe for confusion. One strong statement atop another strong statement and, possibly, another, is not only costly but risks building a tower of babble. It starts to get hard to keep track. That does not mean designers need to be put back into their little velvet boxes and contained (please, let that not be the takeaway). But rather that a new detente needs to develop between the creative and the corporate sides of this industry: one of mutual respect, that attempts to equalize the balance of power, so that both are invested in, and loyal to, the same future: dressing their customer as relevantly and responsively and reliably as possible. Think of them as the three Rs of fashion. Wouldn't you buy that?","Fashion's cycle has turned again, and the balance of influence has shifted, with new names at Dior, Lanvin, YSL and Valentino reshaping more than silhouettes.",bc633e59-b4ec-5b13-92e9-930f67bd3bab,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/28/fashion/28TIP-WEB-COMBO/28TIP-WEB-COMBO-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=2d9dc68ea1c83a20d4a4a74759b68a7955fb5d7042dc152318a85429ebbbbd6f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Clockwise from top left: Bouchra Jarrar; Pierpaolo Piccioli; Maria Grazia Chiuri; Anthony Vaccarello.,bc633e59-b4ec-5b13-92e9-930f67bd3bab,N24News/imgs/bc633e59-b4ec-5b13-92e9-930f67bd3bab.jpg,19
Travel,Hotel Review: Modern Luxury in the Vineyards of France,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/03/travel/hotel-review-modern-luxury-in-the-vineyards-of-france.html,"Many of the 55 rooms at the Relais Chambord have direct views of the neighboring Chateau de Chambord.





There is no shortage of landmarks and charming chateaus in two of France's greatest wine regions, the Loire Valley and Champagne. Modern, design-focused lodging, however, has been much slower to develop. But two recently opened properties in the region -- one a renovation, the other a new development -- are changing that. From 150 euros, or about $175, based on current exchange rates. Designed by the award-winning French architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte, the Relais de Chambord is a four-star boutique hotel set in a converted inn located directly on the Domaine de Chambord, a Unesco World Heritage site and the largest enclosed natural reserve in Europe. The hotel, which opened in March 2018 after an 18-million-euro renovation, isn't embellishing when it promises Chateau views from some of their 55 rooms -- the Chateau de Chambord, the Loire Valley's 500-year-old landmark, dating back to the era of Francois I, is truly in its backyard. An earthy color palette in guest rooms and the decorative use of vintage garden tools and nature-inspired engravings in common areas, on loan from the Domaine's conservatory, create a design scheme that is at once contemporary and in harmony with its surroundings. With an upscale restaurant, Le Grand Saint Michel, as well as a wellness spa and a host of outdoor activities, including horseback riding and organized bike rides, the Relais de Chambord has positioned itself as a culinary and nature-focused getaway. Within eyeshot of the Chateau de Chambord, beloved for its French Renaissance architecture and its recently restored French formal gardens, the hotel has the rare luxury of sitting directly on the Domaine de Chambord, one of only three national parks in France and located two hours from Paris.

I booked a Chambord room which offered unobstructed views of the Chateau's rear formal gardens, breathtaking even as rain fell for part of my stay. The orange-hued velvet headboard and cashmere throw on the bed added a warm touch to the room's otherwise understated and neutral color palette. The key design element common to all 55 rooms is a statement wall featuring a black and white illustration of one distinct piece of the Chateau de Chambord. A bonus: blissful quiet, save for the sound of the Domaine's fauna awaking with the rising sun. Wi-Fi is free and each room has a minibar, however mine was out of order during my visit.

While the hotel has a billiard room and spa, which includes two treatment rooms, a hammam and sauna and an outdoor Jacuzzi overlooking the Cosson river, it's the outdoor activities in the park that make the stay special. Guests can rent electric boats across from the hotel for rides along the canal at the foot of the Chateau ($18 for 30 minutes), borrow electric bikes to explore nearly 10 square miles of park land, take a 4 x 4 tour with a forest guide to discover the nature reserve's biodiversity ($20 for a 90-minute tour), play a round of tennis in courts reserved for guests, or visit the Chateau (the hotel has standard tickets and can book private tours for guests). Royal Connection is an affordable shuttle service that works regularly with the hotel for guests who wish to take day trips to visit other Chateaux in the region. The Grand Saint Michel, the hotel's primary restaurant open for lunch and dinner (and for breakfast, exclusively for hotel guests), is arguably the hotel's center of attraction with its warm, contemporary design featuring an eye-catching light fixture designed by Marcel Wanders, and modern bistro menu that highlights seasonal products from local farms. When the weather allows, have your meal or even a glass of wine outside on the spacious terrace facing the Chateau. Room service was not yet available during my stay.

From 400 euros or about $460 Epernay is lined with the headquarters and visiting centers of the world's most renowned Champagne houses like Moet et Chandon and Perrier-Jouet, making it one of the region's most popular spots to visit. But the small town has long lacked enough hotel options to accommodate demand, leading most visitors to stay in nearby Reims. Le 25bis, from the biodynamic champagne house Leclerc Briant, fills the gap with a guesthouse that marries contemporary Scandinavian design with antiqued French furnishings. Occupying a private residence from the 18th century, the five-room property was designed by UK-based firm RamseyKrause to be a homey extension of the winery's adjacent tasting room. Whether in the ground floor sitting roomor in individual bedrooms, the designers preserved as many period elements as possible, like the original pine floors and the Empire style plasterwork. Two leafy terraces make for peaceful areas to have breakfast in the morning and champagne tastings in the afternoon.

At 10 minutes by foot from the Epernay train station, 25bis sits at the very heart of the Avenue de Champagne, a grand thoroughfare lined with Champagne houses that earned Unesco World Heritage status in 2015. Each room is done up with different color schemes and decorative features. I stayed in Room 3, which overlooked the property's rear garden. It blended 19th century French antiques with clean, beautiful lines, like the hulking armoire near the bed and wooden desk facing the window, with contemporary pieces from brands like Knoll, Carl Hansen & Son and Ercol. The striking yellow Louis XIV bergere armchairs were redesigned by RamseyKrause with a new velvet. But the big draw for me were the bookcases filled to the brim with the Blanche collection of literary classics published by Gallimard. The mostly-marble bathroom was spacious, brightly lit and featured both a claw-foot bathtub and one of the largest showers I've ever seen in a boutique property. The shower's stainless-steel rimmed glass enclosure prevented any water from spilling over onto the floor. Inside, there was a marble ledge with enough space to place both my own products and the Hermes 'Un Jardin sur le Nil' bath and body products provided by the hotel.",Two recently opened hotels in the Loire Valley and Champagne region are ideal spots for traveling oenophiles and French monarchists.,6424e51e-85c7-5f16-aed9-86694365f552,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/04/travel/04checkin-france1/04checkin-france1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=395f0fa7cf9ac4e16d00077010914d9c3c4472ece55cf97519070b37ab15d4ac&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Many of the 55 rooms at the Relais Chambord have direct views of the neighboring Château de Chambord.,6424e51e-85c7-5f16-aed9-86694365f552,N24News/imgs/6424e51e-85c7-5f16-aed9-86694365f552.jpg,4
Dance,Review: Capturing Childhood's Wonder in Dance and Mime,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/08/arts/dance/akram-khan-chotto-desh-new-victory-theater-review.html,"And what Ms. Buckmaster has preserved -- what must have prompted the adaptation -- is the sense of wonder, elicited mainly through a beguiling mix of dance and mime. When the soloist playing Mr. Khan (Nicolas Ricchini and Dennis Alamanos alternate in the role), tilts his bald head forward to reveal a face painted on the pate, he seems to become a puppet, an effect both uncanny and giggle-producing. In the central section, a fable about a boy's journey through the rain forest in pursuit of honey, the integration of live action and the projection of gorgeous line drawings is a delight.

It's the original frame that remains the most childish: an adult Mr. Khan, locked out of his cellphone, getting assistance from the voice of a 12-year-old Bangladeshi boy on a help line. ""I don't know where I'm supposed to be,"" the Khan character says, a problem of identity solved at the end, when he remembers a Rosebud-like password.

Only in stories for children are such questions so easily dispelled. Yet an earlier scene in ""Chotto Desh"" does suggest how Mr. Khan learned to live with the diverse influences of his upbringing.
