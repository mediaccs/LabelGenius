Books,"What It Means to Be 'Latinx,' and What That Means for America",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/books/review/latinx-ed-morales.html,"LATINX

 The New Force in American Politics and Culture

 By Ed Morales 

368 pp. Verso. $24.95.

In September, just in time for Hispanic Heritage Month, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary recognized the word ""Latinx,"" which it defines as ""of, relating to or marked by Latin American heritage -- used as a gender-neutral alternative to Latino or Latina."" I was happy to see the addition, and also more than a little amused. I thought back to my freshman year of college in 1992. As I sat in a computer room in my dorm working away on an early Macintosh, a red squiggly line immediately appeared underneath the word ""Chicano"" after I typed it into the paper I was writing about my family's background. When I hit the spell check to see what the problem was, Microsoft Word had a suggestion: Chicago. ""You don't even exist,"" popped into my head. Unfortunately, this wasn't a new experience. Years earlier, in middle school, I'd been asked to fill out a form that included a question about my background. There were three options to choose from: black, white or other. ""Well, I'm not black or white,"" I remember thinking, pencil in hand, ""but I don't like the sound of 'other.'"" I left it blank.

For many Latinos, stories like these are all too familiar. In ""Latinx: The New Force in American Politics and Culture,"" Ed Morales fills in that blank as well as the long, painful, complex and intersectional struggle for identity that has shaped America's Latino community. As Morales notes, Latinx is just the latest in a series of terms, from Hispanic to Latino/a and even Latin@, employed to refer to individuals of Latin American heritage in an inclusive way.

Reading Morales's dissection of Latinx identity formation, however, one begins to believe that the x in ""Latinx"" is more than just a means of providing gender-neutrality. As in algebra, the x is variable. How a Latino or Latina perceives himself or herself -- and how he or she is perceived by others -- often depends on context. Unhappy with the binary notion of race popular in the United States, Morales offers the concept of mestizaje, or hybridity, that encompasses a spectrum of identity, the result of hundreds of years of intermixing among African, European and indigenous peoples in Mexico, Latin America and the Caribbean. Latinos can be black, white, brown or anything in between. Skin color, national origin, whether one lives in the mainland United States or outside of it, and one's ability to speak Spanish, not to mention gender and sexual orientation, all play a role in one's self-concept.","Julian Castro, the former San Antonio mayor and Obama cabinet member, reviews Ed Morales's new book on the diversity and hybridity of Latino identity.",01f84a9a-57e4-5e9b-b934-e24edb67f93a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/18/books/review/18castro/18castro-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=f0d4cd38c55884cb2796cbe5780d1cb9cc463788346cf5549833c78d100bd6ea&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A crowd at the 2018 Puerto Rican Day Parade in New York City.,01f84a9a-57e4-5e9b-b934-e24edb67f93a,N24News/imgs/01f84a9a-57e4-5e9b-b934-e24edb67f93a.jpg,13
Travel,A Nashville Restaurant That Tastes as Good as It Looks,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/travel/henrietta-red-nashville-restaurant-review.html,"Henrietta Red, a restaurant in the Germantown neighborhood of Nashville that opened last February , has many of the telltale trappings of Instagram clickbait. While there's no millennial pink, the black sandwich board and expanse of marble at the bar, coupled with the wishbone chairs and tile-framed wood-burning oven in the dining room, fit a certain envy-inducing aesthetic. But unlike other places that hit those idealized notes, Henrietta Red lives up to its image as a place you actually want to be.

Start your meal with something fun -- a craft cocktail Jell-O shot, perhaps. The potent, jiggly cubes offer reassurance that, despite the restaurant's cool interior, it's O.K. to relax. They come are offered in flavors like Fernet and Coke, are served skewered, and, like liquid cocktails, come with a garnish.

Next up are more things to slurp. One of the goals of Julia Sullivan, the chef and an owner, who opened the restaurant with the general manager and sommelier Allie Poindexter, was to fill the void in Nashville's oysterscape. A small, perfectly nice selection hailing from both coasts, Canada and the Gulf, comes with a seasonal mignonette (in our case, juicy watermelon) in addition to the usual condiments.

Sports,Dominic Thiem Beats Rafael Nadal in Australian Open Quarterfinal,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/sports/tennis/thiem-nadal-australian-open.html,"MELBOURNE, Australia -- There will be a new-generation men's semifinal at the Australian Open when Dominic Thiem faces Alexander Zverev for a chance to take on one of the sport's Big Three for a title. Attacking and defending brilliantly, Thiem, 26, defeated No. 1 Rafael Nadal in four taut sets on Wednesday night, closing out Nadal by winning three tiebreakers. Zverev, 22, rallied from losing the first set to outwit and outplay Stan Wawrinka, a three-time Grand Slam champion and another of the game's establishment figures. The youngsters, it seems, are getting closer to the elusive prize of a major singles title.

Whoever wins on Friday will have a tall order in the final, either the six-time Australian Open champion Roger Federer or, more likely, the seven-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic. ""To really break a barrier, one young player has to win a Slam, and yeah, one of us is going to be in the finals, but it's still a very long way to go,"" said Thiem, who appeared delighted but cleareyed at his late-night news conference in Melbourne Park. His win over Nadal lasted 4 hour 10 minutes and ended after midnight. There was a time when Thiem would not have been considered a youngster in men's tennis. Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe, two of the greats, were both done winning Grand Slam singles titles by 25. But the norms have changed with the prolonged dominance of the Big Three -- Federer, Djokovic and Nadal -- who have proved, collectively, that turning 30 is no obstacle to piling up major titles and taking turns at No. 1. Thiem, a velvet-voiced Austrian with a work ethic as strong as his right arm, understands this too well. That made his 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4), 4-6, 7-6 (6) victory over Nadal all the more meaningful.

""If you want to have a chance against him, one of the all-time greats, everything needs to work in your game,"" said Thiem, the No. 5 seed. Thiem has multiple victories over all of the Big Three and has beaten Nadal four times on clay, Nadal's preferred surface. But this was his first victory over Nadal in a Grand Slam tournament after losing to him in the last two French Open finals. Both men knew what they were in for. When they faced off on a hardcourt in the quarterfinals of the United States Open in 2018, Thiem pushed Nadal to a fifth-set tiebreaker before losing in 4 hours 49 minutes. Nadal was so spent, though, that he was unable to finish his next match against Juan Martin del Potro. Wednesday's tussle hinged on Thiem's ability to recover from adversity and Nadal's repeated failure to capitalize on openings and opportunities that he normally would have pounced upon. Nadal, who has 19 Grand Slam singles titles, was aiming to tie Federer's men's record of 20, but that record is safe at least until the French Open now. Nadal lost the first set on Wednesday despite having a set point on his serve at 5-3. He lost the second set despite being up 4-2 and a break of serve. He also lost it, to a degree, with the chair umpire, Aurelie Tourte, when she called him for a time violation when he was slow to serve after winning a spectacular, extended point in the sixth game of the second set.

Nadal felt the umpire had started the shot clock too quickly after such a grueling rally. ""You don't like the good tennis,"" he said to her twice, before returning to the baseline. Nadal later expressed his displeasure further to Andreas Egli, a tournament supervisor who was standing courtside. But the irritation did not end there. Earlier in Nadal's career, it was difficult to know from his body language whether he was winning or losing. But he has become much easier to read with the years, and he veered between exasperation and exultation as he and Thiem exchanged powerful baseline blows and rebooted points with acrobatic defense in the corners. Some of their rallies drew gasps from the sellout crowd in Rod Laver Arena. And Nadal, 33, did his best to keep the entertainment going by winning the third set and then breaking Thiem when he served for the match at 5-4 in the fourth. Thiem played a very shaky game, double faulting and making three unforced errors with his forehand. ""It's a little bit demons in the head, like Roger said, it's true,"" Thiem said. ""Everybody has it, and I was just rushing way too much, changing a little bit the tactics from all the match, and that was wrong."" Thiem was referring to Federer's comment earlier in the tournament that ""the demons are always there lurking."" That is probably not be the best quote for an aspiring champion to keep in mind under pressure, but Thiem was able to recover and close out the victory in the tiebreaker, on his third match point. ""I'm really proud of how I stayed in the match after a very tough situation,"" he said. Zverev, a tall German with one of the best two-handed backhands in tennis, has dealt with a few demons of his own during his career, winning prestigious titles but failing to produce his best at the Grand Slam events that define careers.

Seeded seventh at the Open, he arrived in Melbourne after a difficult 2019 season and after struggling in the ATP Cup team event, double faulting repeatedly and losing all of his singles matches. But Zverev worked overtime to prepare and has managed to pull his power game back together in his first run to a Grand Slam semifinal. ""I've won Masters Series, the World Tour Finals, but the Grand Slam were always the weeks where I kind of even wanted it too much,"" he said. ""I was doing things in a way too professional. I was not talking to anybody. I wasn't even going out with friends."" In his view he was ""almost too focused,"" he said, but he has tried to live a more normal existence in Melbourne. He also promised earlier in the tournament to donate $10,000 to Australian bushfire relief after each of his victories, and the entire champion's check of about $2.8 million if he wins the title. ""Easy to say in the first round, right?"" he said with a grin after beating Wawrinka, 1-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2. ""Yes, it's still true. I made the people of Australia a promise, and I will keep that promise if it happens."" The odds are still against it. Thiem leads his head-to-head series with Zverev, 6-2, and has been having no trouble with his own second serve or forehand under pressure. Whoever wins will still have to deal with Federer or Djokovic in the final, and with the trend of Big Three dominance. No active men's player under age 31 has won a Grand Slam singles title.

""I think we are still a pretty long way from overtaking or breaking this kind of barrier,"" Thiem said. So it must seem at this stage, but the youngsters are undeniably coming. Last year, Daniil Medvedev, a 23-year-old Russian, pushed Nadal into a fifth set in the U.S. Open final. On Sunday, someone in his 20s will play for the Australian Open trophy.",Thiem won in a thrilling four sets and will face Alexander Zverev in one semifinal.

Technology,What Ads Are Political? Twitter Struggles With a Definition,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/technology/twitter-political-ad-policy.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- The Alzheimer's Association, a health care advocacy group, recently spent $84,000 on ad campaigns on Twitter. One campaign had a singular purpose: to persuade people to ask Congress for larger investments in medical research for the disease. Now the nonprofit is worried about whether those messages will still fly. That's because Twitter announced last month that it would soon prohibit all political ads from its platform -- and, depending on whom you ask, pushing lawmakers for money for medical research could be seen as a political cause. The Alzheimer's Association was so concerned that it contacted Twitter this month to express misgivings about the political ads ban. ""We're not really sure how it's going to impact us,"" said Mike Lynch, a spokesman for the group. ""A lot of what we do is issue advertising, so it really depends on how they define political advertising."" The Alzheimer's Association is one of many nonprofits and organizations that have put pressure on Twitter over its prohibition of political ads, which is set to start next Friday. The problem is that while campaign ads from candidates are clearly political, other messages that deal with hot-button issues such as abortion, school choice and climate change may or may not cross that line.

On Friday, after weeks of discussions, Twitter rolled out a formal definition of what it considers to be a political ad. Under the official policy, Twitter said ads that discuss elections, candidates, parties and other overtly political content would be prohibited. For ads that refer to causes generally and that are placed by organizations and not politicians or political candidates, Twitter said it would place restrictions on them but not ban them outright. The restrictions included removing advertisers' ability to target specific audiences, a practice known as ""micro targeting."" The ads also cannot mention specific legislation, Twitter said. ""It's a big change for us as a company but one we believe is going to make our service, and political advertising in the world, better,"" Vijaya Gadde , who leads Twitter's legal, policy, trust and safety divisions, said in a call on Friday to introduce the policy.

Twitter's unveiling of its political ads policy did little to mollify its critics, such as conservatives who have said the barring of such ads is an attempt to suppress right-wing voices. ""Whatever they come up with, we fully expect Twitter to continue to censor, block, or to incur 'bugs' that will unfairly silence President Trump and conservatives,"" said Tim Murtaugh , the Trump campaign's communications director. Some super PACs and political groups said Twitter's decision disrupted the political advertising strategy and budget they had already mapped out for the 2020 election. ""Changing the rules halfway through is really dangerous,"" said Danielle Butterfield , the director of paid media for Priorities USA, one of the largest Democratic super PACs. ""A lot of organizations are going to have to look back at their strategy and figure out how to adjust, especially in the middle of the cycle."" She said her group had used ads on Twitter to flag stories about the economy under the Trump administration to local reporters in swing states, a key part of its in-state strategy. Twitter finds itself in a delicate situation because its chief executive, Jack Dorsey, decided last month that the social media service would no longer host political ads. In a series of tweets on Oct. 30, Mr. Dorsey said political ads presented challenges to civic discourse and added that he believed the reach of political messages ""should be earned, not bought.""

Mr. Dorsey, though, was immediately praised by politicians -- including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York -- for taking a stand against political ads. At the time, Mr. Dorsey defined political ads as those sponsored by candidates or that discussed political issues. He said some ads, such as those promoting voter registration, would be permitted as exceptions. Mr. Dorsey, who has since been traveling in Africa, was unavailable for comment on Friday. His pronouncements quickly kicked up a ruckus among nonprofits, lobbyists and others, who said they feared they would no longer be able to run issue-based ads on Twitter because it was unclear if their messages would be considered political. ""The policy would tilt the playing field,"" said Eric Pooley, a spokesman for the Environmental Defense Fund, an environmental advocacy group. ""Nonprofit organizations need to be able to communicate to the public. That's what we do."" The American Federation for Children, a school choice advocacy group, said that Mr. Dorsey's announcement had created uncertainties and that it was being unfairly swept up in Twitter's efforts to clean up its platform. Affiliates of Planned Parenthood added that they already struggled to get ads approved on social media and worried about a ban. ""Digital advertisement is a cost-effective way for small nonprofits to reach their audience. The question becomes, where do we turn next?"" said Emma Corbett , the communications director of Planned Parenthood Empire State Acts, which represents Planned Parenthood in New York State.",Twitter has said it will ban all political ads.

Sports,"A Supposed Stickler for the Rules, Now at the Center of a U.S.C. Scandal",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/sports/college-admissions-scandal-heinel.html,"A Supposed Stickler for the Rules, Now at the Center of a U.S.C. Scandal

LOS ANGELES -- Ron Allice, the track and field coach at the University of Southern California, assumed bad news was on the way when Donna Heinel summoned him to her office back in 2011. Heinel, the athletic department administrator who functioned as a gatekeeper over whether recruited athletes could find a spot at the increasingly competitive private university, had found a problem with the track athlete Allice was pushing. He had taken a sign language class to fulfill a foreign language requirement and, though that was the standard in the state university systems, Heinel dug in against him. Now, Allice wonders if there was another reason Heinel was so resolute. And he is not alone. Heinel, 57, who as an unyielding, by-the-book administrator rose to a position of unchecked authority during her 16 years in the U.S.C. athletic department, has emerged as a central figure in the academic admissions scandal that has ensnared members of rich -- and in some cases famous -- families. They are among 50 people charged with carrying out a series of bribes and rigged admissions qualifications, including making up athletic accomplishments, in order to get affluent children into prestigious universities across the country. Nowhere was the scheme more widespread than at U.S.C., where four others who have coached there -- one of them until earlier this month -- are under indictment. Heinel stands accused of being at the fulcrum of the scheme, conspiring with Rick Singer, a private admissions consultant, to obtain millions in bribes and then easing more than two dozen students into the school through the so-called side door of athletic admissions, using fraudulent athletic profiles.

Through a lawyer, Heinel, who was fired the day she was indicted, declined to comment. Heinel is the only administrator who has been charged, and her university is the only one of eight involved at which more than one coach has been implicated. U.S.C.'s interim president, Wanda Austin, has pledged to revamp its athletic admissions process. According to the indictment, Heinel and Singer, the private counselor who hatched the plan, collaborated with the water polo coach, Jovan Vavic, and the former soccer coach, Ali Khosroshahin, who was fired in 2013, and his former assistant Laura Janke, who created phony athletic profiles. Like Heinel, Vavic was fired by U.S.C. on March 12, the day the indictments were unsealed.

Walsh and his former colleagues are now wondering how far back the alleged scam might have gone. Heinel required coaches who recruited athletes from Europe to have their transcripts translated in the United States to limit the chances of fraud, Walsh said. One runner he recruited was an artist. Heinel demanded to see a portfolio, and copies or photos of the works were not sufficient. The originals had to be shipped. ""She was basically the gatekeeper,"" said a former U.S.C. coach who requested anonymity because he was concerned that being identified could hurt his career. ""If you wanted to get someone in, she was the person that really made that decision. Or not."" Regardless of that power, Heinel largely kept a low profile both on campus and off. She has two children in elementary school and lives with her partner, a school-district special-education administrator, on Naples Island, an exclusive neighborhood in Long Beach, Calif., known for multimillion-dollar homes on winding canals. Neighbors were shocked when F.B.I. agents surrounded Heinel's house on a narrow, quiet side street just before dawn 10 days ago to arrest her, instructing an inquisitive neighbor to go back in his house. Heinel was described by neighbors as quiet and unassuming, driving a red sedan reminiscent of the official color of U.S.C., walking the dog, jogging or riding a bike frequently, and flying drones or playing sports with her son and daughter. Neighbors said Heinel generally kept to herself, even when they mentioned their children had gone to U.S.C.

It's not clear when exactly Heinel developed a relationship with Singer. But since 2014, Heinel had presented to admissions more than two dozen students with bogus athletic credentials, including a football player whose high school had no football team, as well as a 5-foot-5 men's basketball player and a high school cheerleader made to look like a lacrosse star. In fact, emails and recorded phone conversations in the indictment paint a portrait of Heinel not merely as a conduit, but also as a fixer who could spot potential brush fires and swept aside skeptical questions. When counselors at two high schools reviewing applications to U.S.C. last April raised questions with parents about the listed athletic qualifications of their children, Heinel called Singer. In a voice mail message captured by investigators, she warned that the indignant parents must be stopped from going to the high school ""yelling at counselors."" ""That'll shut everything -- that'll shut everything down,"" she said. Around the same time, Heinel wrote a lengthy email to the U.S.C. director of admissions to set aside concerns about the athletic credentials of Matteo Sloane, the son of a drinking and wastewater systems entrepreneur who was admitted as a water polo player despite not playing the sport. Heinel said that because Sloane's high school did not have a water polo team, he played at L.A. Water Polo Club during the school year and traveled internationally with a youth junior team in the summer, playing in Greece, Serbia and Portugal. None of this was true. ""He is small,"" Heinel continued in the email. ""But he has a long torso but short strong legs, plus he is fast which helps him win the draws to start play after goals are scored. He is an attack perimeter player."" She then thanked the admissions director for raising the discrepancy. Sloane did not play for U.S.C. The admissions director replied to Heinel, thanking her and saying that a paraphrased version of her email would be passed along to assure the high school officials that U.S.C. had looked into the matter. ""They seemed unusually skeptical,"" the director wrote.

Pat Haden, a former U.S.C. football star lured from his post at a private equity firm to become athletic director after the football and basketball programs were penalized in 2010 for improper benefits to players, tripled the department's compliance staff. He also promoted Heinel to senior woman administrator and the director of admissions and eligibility, jobs that had previously been handled by two associate athletic directors. Haden could not be reached for comment. More than 50 people charged. In 2019, a federal investigation known as Operation Varsity Blues snared dozens of parents, coaches and exam administrators in a vast college admissions scheme that implicated athletic programs at the University of Southern California, Yale, Stanford and other schools. The linchpin. William Singer is an admissions counselor at the center of the scheme. He led an elaborate effort to bribe coaches and test monitors, falsify exam scores and fabricate student biographies. He has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with the government. He has not been sentenced. The parents. Actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin are among the more than three dozen parents -- many of them wealthy and powerful -- charged in the case. A private equity financier and a former casino executive, who were found guilty on Oct. 8, 2021, were the first to stand trial. The former C.E.O. of Pimco has received the harshest sentence so far. The coaches. The case also involved athletic coaches from some of the most prestigious universities in the country, including Stanford sailing coach John Vandemoer and Yale women's soccer coach Rudy Meredith. Mr. Vandemoer, who was among the first to take a plea deal, has written a book detailing how he was duped by Mr. Singer. Heinel managed to cash in on her experience navigating admissions for prospective student athletes. In 2008, she established a side business, Clear the Clearinghouse, which advised high school coaches, counselors and administrators on N.C.A.A. rules for athletes. She offered subscriptions services, for up to $700 annually, and hosted workshops that cost $100, along with offering to do consulting work. Heinel's business held two-hour workshops at U.S.C.'s Galen Center. The notices advertising the clinics were sent to about 150 high school and private counselors, either from Heinel's work email account or from that of Katie Fuller, an assistant director of admissions and eligibility at the school. Typically, about 50 people attended the workshops, according to one private counselor who said she attended two of them, several years apart. The workshops were unusual in that most schools, including U.S.C., put them on at no cost or for a nominal fee as a sort of public service for counselors. One of the few documented interviews with Heinel is from a panel discussion for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people she participated in at U.S.C. in 2013, at which she described herself ""as a loner for mostly all of my life."" Growing up in Philadelphia, she recalled, she was estranged from her parents for more than two years when she came out to them as gay while she was a student at Springfield College in Massachusetts, where she was a member of the swim team. But she reconciled with them somewhat a couple of years later when a sister became ill with cancer.

The experience of coming out to her parents stayed with her. ""I've just kind of been, 'Do what I want to do, when I want to do it,"" she said. Years later, established in her career as an athletic administrator, Heinel quickly developed a rapport with Haden, who has a gay son. Haden, and his successor, Lynn Swann, instituted few checks on Heinel's powers. From October until April, Heinel would meet every other Thursday with a subcommittee from the admissions office that included the dean of admissions and two assistants. At each meeting, Heinel would go through a list of recruits, including their test scores, transcripts and athletic profile, and within a few days would get a thumbs-up or thumbs-down on whether they would be admitted, according to both colleagues and the indictment. Sprinkled among those hundreds of recruits in 19 sports were the fraudulent athletic resumes that Heinel is accused of shepherding. Often those profiles were created by Janke, who was paid by Singer, but according to the affidavit, on at least one occasion, Heinel created a profile on a U.S.C. letterhead that made it appear as if the U.S.C. lacrosse coach were lavishing praise on a recruit who in reality had never played the sport. Almost always, within days of one of Singer's clients being conditionally admitted to U.S.C., a check for $50,000 or more made out to ""U.S.C. women's athletics"" or ""U.S.C. athletics"" would arrive in an envelope addressed to Heinel. In all, those checks added up to $1.3 million, which were deposited into accounts that Heinel largely controlled and could distribute to various teams. (Heinel also received $20,000 per month dating to last July from Singer in what court documents referred to as a ""sham"" consulting agreement.)

In explaining to Todd Blake why he had received a solicitation call asking for another donation to women's basketball when his daughter was admitted fraudulently as a volleyball player, Singer said: ""the money went toward her,"" referring to Heinel, ""and she gets to decide where it goes within the department."" Eight years later, Allice, the retired track and field coach, remains annoyed. Memories of that hurdler were dredged up by the allegations against a woman who now stands accused of fraud. The athlete Heinel said did not measure up to the school's standards was hardly a borderline athlete, much less one of the fakes she and Singer created.

Opinion,Tiananmen's Other Children,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/opinion/tiananmen-protest-china.html,"Past protests actually are remembered in China -- and commemorated with yet more protests.

At some point in late May 1989, amid weeks of demonstrations that brought several hundred thousand citizens demanding democratic reforms to Tiananmen Square, in Beijing, China's leader, Deng Xiaoping, is reported to have declared that ""200 dead could bring 20 years of peace."" By June 4, some 2,000 people, mostly local residents, had been killed. The Tiananmen Square protests were the culmination of China's long-running pro-democracy movement -- and the massacre marked a peak of government repression. Each year, as the June 4 anniversary approaches, the Chinese Communist Party jails dissidents and censors social media. It tries to purge reminders of any democratic movement from the country's collective memory. The novelist Yan Lianke lamented in 2013, ""In today's China, amnesia trumps memory."" In 2014, the academic Edward Steinfeld bemoaned that ""many parts of China have moved on, and to some extent forgotten"" the event. The journalist Louisa Lim has said that China's people are ""complicit in an act of mass amnesia.""

We, instead, demonstrate that Chinese people remember Tiananmen and other democracy movements and commemorate them, especially on anniversaries, with yet more forms of protests, despite the government's extraordinary efforts to erase or rewrite the historical record. Our latest research on what we call ""focal moments"" shows not only that demands for democratic reform have persisted and resurged in mainland China throughout seven decades of Communist rule, but also that demonstrations, flash movements or pockets of resistance echo and reference previous ones and inspire the next. Since today the C.C.P. is quick to repress any explicit demands for democracy or individual rights, open calls of that kind hardly occur. Nonetheless, there is a clear lineage between all these surges of contestation, and it is apparent from the calendar of protests -- and the party's calendar of repression -- as well as the language used on protest days. In addition to the Tiananmen Square movement, four other major occasions have informed this schedule. And our statistical work reveals that there are 30 percent more protests on the anniversaries marking those moments than on other days of the year, and that protest spikes (defined as an increase of one standard deviation over the average) are 50 percent more common on those days. In the late 1970s, Deng launched a program of economic liberalization, including the so-called ""four modernizations"" in agriculture, industry, defense and science and technology. Hoping for political reform as well, in 1978 citizens throughout the country began putting up pro-democracy posters in public places, including in one spot in central Beijing that came to be known as ""Democracy Wall.""

On Nov. 27, 1978, some 10,000 people marched from there to Tiananmen Square, the symbolic heart of Beijing. The activist Wei Jingsheng demanded that the government adopt democracy as a ""fifth modernization,"" a pointed rejoinder to Deng's four. Scores of protesters were arrested, including Wei, who spent 18 years in prison. Democracy Wall was taken down. In December 1986, university students rallied behind the public intellectual Fang Lizhi's call that the C.C.P. treat the rights mentioned in China's Constitution as ""actual rights."" Tens of thousands of students protested at 150 universities and asked to directly elect representatives to the National People's Congress. The government agreed to some demands and the students disbanded; then the government mostly reneged.

A few years later came the Tiananmen movement, sparked by the death of the reformist former C.C.P. leader Hu Yaobang. Many of the main participants from the 1978 demonstrations were prominent again in 1989. The activist Wang Dan later said that Fang's activities in 1986 had ""inspired the '89 generation."" In December 2008, some 300 Chinese intellectuals, lawyers and officials circulated a manifesto, Charter 08, demanding independent courts, basic human rights and an end to one-party rule. The first sentence noted that 2008 marked the 30th anniversary of the Democracy Wall movement; the document also mentioned ""June Fourth"" as one in ""a string of human rights disasters"" caused by the C.C.P. Some 10,000 people signed the manifesto online before the government took it down -- then it was distributed by hand. One of its leading authors, Liu Xiaobo, had gone on a hunger strike in 1989 at Tiananmen Square. In November 2014, the C.C.P. announced that Dec. 4 would be a new holiday: Constitution Day, to commemorate the date on which the text had been adopted in 1982. Outraged at the irony -- many rights nominally in the Constitution, like freedom of speech, religion or assembly, were routinely repressed -- nearly 1,000 people protested in Beijing on Dec. 4, 2014. (On that first Constitution Day, the word ""constitution"" was the word most heavily censored on the microblogging platform Weibo.)

Some months earlier, dozens of journalists, lawyers and academics had written an open letter demanding that the government respect the Constitution. One section denounced restrictions on the right to assemble ""promulgated hurriedly in the wake of the students and residents democratic movement in 1989."" Today, after years of repression, protests tend to be less openly referential, and they employ more indirect language as a stand-in or proxy for democratic resistance. An N.G.O. based in Hong Kong has collected nearly 40,000 images of protests on the mainland between 2014 and 2019. Using optical character recognition software, we analyzed the language from protesters' banners and slogans, and reviewed related tweets. We found frequent use of words and phrases like ""citizens"" and ""the right to know,"" or ""people power"" and ""court enforcement."" The discourse is somewhat legalistic, but the message is still clear: This is, as the political scientist Lianjiang Li and others have argued, evidence of a ""rights consciousness"" and an inherent criticism of the C.C.P. For example, on Dec. 4, 2014 -- the first official Constitution Day -- several thousand teachers in Yuzhou, a city in central China, went on strike demanding back pay -- and ""defending their legitimate rights."" On June 4, 2017 -- note the day, a reference to Tiananmen -- hundreds of people marched in Hanzhong, northwestern China. They claimed to want to collect unpaid benefits from the local state-owned steel plant, but their banner -- signed by hundreds -- proclaimed, ""The Government Works for Me!"" Some discussed ""Western theories of government"" and called on the Chinese state to ""act for the people."" The scale of many of these protests might seem small for a country of 1.4 billion people today. But the C.C.P., for one, takes them seriously.",Past protests actually are remembered in China — and commemorated with yet more protests.,cfc1307a-2457-58f9-bd68-f97d78b108ac,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/04/opinion/04baggotc1/04baggotc1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=84f4bc0260baad656d5f8cf097ce24cd8c9875c726192dbf142e40a5912475fe&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The now-iconic image of &ldquo;Tank Man,&rdquo; a pro-democracy protester in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, on June 5, 1989.",cfc1307a-2457-58f9-bd68-f97d78b108ac,N24News/imgs/cfc1307a-2457-58f9-bd68-f97d78b108ac.jpg,11
Style,So You're Thinking of Moving …,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/24/style/moving-during-covid-coronavirus.html,"I am an extreme planner. But I'll admit that the task of planning a cross-country move during a pandemic with a suppressed immune system (and a sassy cat named Brunnhilde) was a daunting one. It was a plan born of necessity; I have Crohn's disease, an autoimmune disease that affects the intestinal tract, as well as psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis -- conditions that are managed through a rigid medication schedule that suppresses my immune system, leaving me particularly vulnerable to all manner of infections. Immunocompromised individuals are at a higher risk of experiencing severe illness from the virus that causes Covid-19 and can be sick longer once they are infected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Which means I spent nearly 100 days sequestered in my apartment in Brooklyn this spring, leaving only to get the mail. After weeks of relying on the kindness of friends and delivery services, I decided to move to Kansas City to have more space to socially distance and to be closer to family. I am far from the only person who has moved this year, but because I had to be particularly neurotic about it, I am sharing my reporting -- based in part on reader questions -- on how to navigate the experience safely.

If you have additional suggestions or tips, please share them in the comments. Good luck on your journeys and WEAR A MASK! Is it safe and ethical to hire movers? In most states, moving companies are considered essential businesses and many have altered their procedures to minimize risk for their employees and clients. But it's best to call each company in advance and ask them about their new coronavirus protocols, because there is no one-size-fits-all approach to safety. In general, you should be looking for companies that require employees and customers to wear masks, detail how they practice social distancing, and can explain what steps they are taking to screen and protect their employees from becoming sick. Get multiple quotes -- this goes for pricing, too! -- and compare them to the cost of renting a truck for yourself. I chose to pack my own belongings and hire a moving company to do the heavy lifting. My movers wore masks throughout the process, and the company required that I have a hand-washing station available on both ends of the move. Everyone practiced social distancing.

Make a list of your must-haves for your new home. Ask friends, family and colleagues if they have neighborhood recommendations. Then, use your digital sleuthing skills to learn about the area or properties and narrow your choices. Use Google Street View to virtually tour the neighborhood. Find Facebook Groups or city-specific comment forums that put you in touch with -- or give you insight into -- the people who live there. Read online reviews of apartment complexes. I've also used location searches on Instagram to get a feel for certain apartment communities and their surrounding neighborhoods. Regardless of whether you are working with a homeowner or a leasing agent, insist on taking a video tour of the specific property you are interested in. Ask detailed questions to help paint a clear picture of the property. Don't rush -- you're making a major decision and should feel comfortable before signing a lease.

I cleaned each piece, arranged the pickup and asked that anyone coming to claim the items wear a mask. Advertising your free stuff on Craigslist can also work very well. Is it safer to fly, drive or take the train? Given that all travel choices include some risk of infection, the decision will most likely depend on the distance and cost. My move required a combination of flying and driving. Other than the belongings that movers were taking, I needed to haul a small jungle of plants and Brunnhilde home to Kansas City. So my father generously volunteered to fly to New York to help with the 19-hour drive. My dad took the first flight of the day (so as to be on the cleanest plane), wore a mask throughout the journey and disinfected high-touch surfaces as he went. The flight had about 30 passengers onboard. Upon arriving in New York, he picked up and disinfected a rental van. He stayed in a hotel to further disinfect himself from any germs from the flight and brought separate sets of clothes for the road trip. For those who would travel by train, Amtrak says it is offering private rooms on some routes, limiting tickets to encourage distancing and changing its cleaning procedures. Strong personal hygiene and mask wearing is recommended no matter your travel method.

Where to stop and what to eat if you're driving ""Don't go far, stay in your car,"" Robert Sinclair Jr., a Northeast regional spokesman for AAA, told The Times. Of course, you'll need to take a break sometimes. Scenic overlooks are a great place to appreciate nature while stretching your legs. If you're stopping at a truck stop or gas station, look for an option that seems less busy. Sanitize your hands each time you leave the car. When pumping gas, Mr. Sinclair advised sanitizing your hands after replacing the pump and before you touch the car door handle -- disposable gloves work here, too. Sanitize your credit card before and after you hand it to an attendant. Don't forget to bring snacks for the road. And did we mention you should wear a mask?

Other advice for those with chronic illnesses When talking to people during the moving process, I found that being upfront about my compromised immune system was a quick way to make clear why I was asking about hygiene or accommodations. I also tried to schedule my moving dates around my medication schedule to minimize side effects and stress. I suggest working in advance with your medical team and insurance to refill any prescriptions, or to find new doctors if you're moving to a new city. (And of course, don't forget to take medications with you.) Living through a pandemic is exhausting, and even more so if you are navigating these times with a chronic illness or other vulnerability. Don't forget to take breaks and be kind to yourself. You're entering a new chapter of your life. Don't forget to enjoy it. The American countryside is beautiful. Look out the window and take it in.",But you're scared about doing it during a pandemic.

Style,The California Fur Ban and What It Means for You,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/style/fur-ban-california.html,"The California Fur Ban and What It Means for You

So California has become the first state to ban fur. This sounds draconian. What does that actually mean? It is true that on Friday the state's governor, Gavin Newsom, signed AB44 into law, which bans sales of new clothing and accessories (handbags, shoes, pompoms, key chains, you know) made of fur. But that does not mean that California is saying sayonara to all fur. For the purpose of the law, fur is defined as ""animal skin or part thereof with hair, fleece or fur fibers attached thereto."" For the purposes of shoppers, that means mink, sable, chinchilla, lynx, fox, rabbit, beaver, coyote and other luxury furs. Exceptions have been made for cowhide, deerskin, sheepskin and goatskin. Which means that shearling is totally fine. Exceptions have also been made for religious observances (shtreimels, the fur hats often worn by Hasidic Jews, can continue to be sold) and other traditional or cultural purposes.

Fur that is already in circulation can remain in circulation. So your grandmother's astrakhan stole is safe. So is any aviator jacket . But how will anyone know if the fur you are wearing is old or new? The law is really about the selling of fur, not the wearing of fur. After all, it is perfectly legal for any California resident to travel to, say, Las Vegas, buy a big fur coat and show it off back home. Some fur partisans are nonetheless concerned that because it is hard to tell what is new fur and what is old fur, they will be ostracized or otherwise seen as having done something illegal if they appear in public in a fur garment. That is a legitimate worry. What happens if a retailer cheats? If retailers break the law, they risk incurring civil penalties, including a fine of up to $500 for a first offense and $1,000 for multiple offenses. I've been hearing about various fur bans for a while. This isn't the first one, is it? California is the first state to ban fur, but it is following the lead of a number of its own municipalities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Berkeley. A variety of countries have banned fur farming, including Serbia, Luxembourg, Belgium, Norway, Germany and the Czech Republic. And similar bills banning fur sales have been introduced in New York City and Hawaii, though they have yet to become law. Really? New York City could be next? A bill was proposed in New York last March by the City Council speaker Corey Johnson, but since then conversation has gone pretty quiet. It is fair to say, though, that the momentum is with the movement.

Not really. Over the last year numerous brands have jumped on the no-fur bandwagon, including Stella McCartney, Gucci, Versace, Coach, Chanel, Prada, Burberry, Michael Kors, Giorgio Armani and Tom Ford. H&M, which is not exactly a haven of mink coats, has said it will no longer use mohair. One of the few holdouts is Fendi, which began life as a fur house, still has five outlets in California that sell fur and even has ""haute fourrure"" fashion shows once a year during couture. (Fendi did not respond to requests for comment on the ban.) Still, all of this just-say-no-to-fur is not quite the sacrifice it sounds, since for many brands fur makes up a very small percentage of sales (at Coach, for example, fur accounted for less than 1 percent of its business). In California, it was an especially tiny percentage. This is true for department stores, too. Saks does not even have a dedicated fur salon in its California stores. On the other hand, fur is still popular in Miami. Cameron Silver of the vintage store Decades said in an email that while there was ""a waning interest"" in fur in California, ""preloved fur pieces"" tend to be the first to sell at trunk shows across the country. ""I was just in Chattanooga, and on a 99-degree day two 1980s-era fur jackets sold within minutes,"" he said. So geography does play a role. Why is all this happening now? The anti-fur movement has been growing for a while, but between the general conversation about the climate crisis, a raft of books like ""Eating Animals,"" by Jonathan Safran Foer, and the sense that fur feels very last century, and contrary to millennial value systems, consumer sentiment has begun to swing against it. And whither consumers, so, too, those that sell to them.

It makes sense, so what are the arguments against it? They range from fur being a meaningful part of national industry -- generating $1.5 billion at retail in the United States, according to the Fur Information Council of America, and accounting for more than 32,000 full-time jobs -- to the fact that many of the fake alternatives are made from petroleum and other plastic-based synthetics and are generally regarded as entirely disposable, which means they end up in landfill, which means fake fur is probably worse for the environment than real fur, which is almost never thrown away.",Is this the beginning of the end of the mink coat? Here's what you need to know.,a61dd5f7-2129-5f19-92c8-9f90967eb1f6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/17/fashion/14FurBan-protest/14FurBan-protest-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=f88c763e933869e44839d8807729ce2a7c8c791694550daa2e1489413b4fb560&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"In Los Angeles, members of PETA held a &ldquo;Fur Is Dead&rdquo; rally along Hollywood Boulevard in 2018.",a61dd5f7-2129-5f19-92c8-9f90967eb1f6,N24News/imgs/a61dd5f7-2129-5f19-92c8-9f90967eb1f6.jpg,15
Dance,An Artist Who Blurs Bodies and Genres in Protest,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/14/arts/dance/an-artist-okwui-okpokwasili-who-blurs-bodies-and-genres-in-protest.html,"When Okwui Okpokwasili talks about her work, she treats each question like a knot to be unraveled, physically as much as verbally. Emphatic gestures punctuate her sentences, or complete them, as if movement might summon the answer. ""I want to fall apart, just enough,"" she said recently over coffee near her Brooklyn home, discussing her approach to performing and making performance. Her palms opened like the pages of a book, suggesting a blank slate, or a readiness for anything. ""And there's this hope that something else can come through -- I don't know what."" If you've seen Ms. Okpokwasili onstage -- in her own genre-blurring work or in that by dance and theater artists like Ralph Lemon, Dean Moss and Young Jean Lee -- you probably know what she means. Nearly six feet tall, with a hypnotic voice and limbs that swallow up space, she pushes herself to the edge as a performer, playing with extremes of ecstasy, sadness or rage with almost dangerous intensity. Her Bessie Award-winning ""Bronx Gothic,"" a fiercely intimate solo inspired by her Bronx upbringing (and the subject of a new documentary coming to Film Forum in July), began with her trembling to the point of near exhaustion. In Mr. Lemon's 2010 ""How Can You Stay in the House All Day and Not Go Anywhere?"" she spent part of each performance in tears.

It's a certain kind of getting lost. ""I'm looking for mysteries, looking for some useful confusion,"" she said. While that goes for all of her work as a choreographer, writer, performer and director, Ms. Okpokwasili, 44, was referring to her latest, ""Poor People's TV Room,"" which begins a two-week run at New York Live Arts on Wednesday, April 19.

A collaboration with her husband and longtime creative partner, Peter Born, also 44, the project grew out of her interest in resistance movements propelled by women, black women in particular, and the body as a site of protest. Exploring themes of memory and invisibility, Ms. Okpokwasili, who is Nigerian-American, is joined by three women ranging in age from their late 20s to late 60s. (The oldest is the South African singer and Olivier Award-winning Broadway actress Thuli Dumakude.) A meeting of dance, text, song, video and installation (Ms. Okpokwasili cringes at talk of disciplinary categories), ""Poor People's TV Room"" is even more elusive, in terms of genre and story, than her previous works. Asked if there's a narrative, she replied, ""Kind of, -ish.""

Since its inception almost three years ago, as a 50-minute song that she performed in Lincoln Center's David Rubenstein Atrium, the piece has passed through multiple iterations (and grown closer to 90 minutes), including performances in January at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, which commissioned the work with Live Arts and Lumberyard. ""I think she doesn't want it to be too legible in a concrete, narrative sense,"" said Philip Bither, the Walker's senior performing arts curator. ""It has a certain logic, but it's very hallucinatory, very dreamlike and surreal, and I think that's all intentional."" While the results may be porous, Ms. Okpokwasili pinpoints two specific sources of inspiration. In 2014 she became fascinated by the Bring Back Our Girls movement, the international response to the kidnapping of nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls by the terrorist group Boko Haram. She found it troubling that as the demand became a viral hashtag, touted by celebrities around the world, people lost sight of the movement's originators, the mothers of the girls. To Ms. Okpokwasili the phenomenon seemed to reflect ""how the cultural contributions of black women, African women, have been erased,"" she said in an email. ""So I wanted to begin a kind of uncovering, for myself."" That brought her to an earlier instance of Nigerian women's resistance, the Women's War of 1929, in which thousands of Ibo women from southeastern Nigeria opposed the threat of taxes from British colonizers. Their struggle was known in the Ibo language as ""egwu,"" which means dance, and involved protest tactics rooted in the body, like older women baring their breasts in front of government officials. While Ms. Okpokwasili's initial inspirations may not be obvious in the final piece, they informed the questions that run through it and that she continues to ask. ""What is it, my interest in brown bodies and brown women performing?"" she said. ""It's about a staking of presence, of place, but how to do that in a way that doesn't further entrench practices that diminish them?""

Working as collaboratively as they do has taken time and space. In a phone interview, Mr. Born said the two had enjoyed ""the luxury"" of several residencies where they could assemble the work's many moving parts (a process that, under other circumstances, might be confined to a few rushed days). The most substantial was a two-year residency at Live Arts, one of the country's most coveted opportunities for choreographers, offering a full salary, health insurance, production funds and other resources. ""I get to wake up in the morning and just think about the piece,"" Mr. Born said. ""I don't have to go be a P.A., I don't have to help load a truck. I did that for many years."" At a rehearsal two weeks before the New York premiere, the work was still in flux, with the script being tweaked, lines relearned and differences hashed out. Both Ms. Okpokwasili and Mr. Born, who is white and grew up in Madison, Wis., said that argument is a driving force in their process. Many of their debates have revolved around the role of ""spoken tongue language,"" as Ms. Okpokwasili calls it, versus the work's physical language, which at times suggests a body breaking into pieces or striving to keep another body alive. ""There's something so essential communicated by how these women are moving with each other that sometimes we're like, is the language superfluous?"" Mr. Born said of the script, which he and Ms. Okpokwasili wrote together. Ms. Okpokwasili added, ""Our fights over what the text is, or who gets to place this language in these bodies, have become kind of complicated.""","Okwui Okpokwasili, a magnetic performer, choreographer and writer returns with a long-gestating new work, ""Poor People's TV Room,"" at New York Live Arts.",a390e667-a228-564a-b1ed-99c9fb3dfbf3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/08/arts/16okwui-1/16okwui-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=8ffd7bd42bf3ff611aca7759c51c46795b8b1fd0943ccaf54331db6d7870c331&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Okwui Okpokwasili, whose new work, ""Poor People's TV Room,"" is the culmination of a two-year residency at New York Live Arts.",a390e667-a228-564a-b1ed-99c9fb3dfbf3,N24News/imgs/a390e667-a228-564a-b1ed-99c9fb3dfbf3.jpg,6
Art & Design,A Mysterious Autograph Hound's Book Is Up for Auction,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/18/arts/design/autographs-auction-twain-lincoln.html,"The little book is a relic from the years after the Civil War, when autograph-crazy Americans collected signatures, a central building block of identity before fingerprinting, Social Security numbers or credit cards. A jeweler named Lafayette Cornwell collected more signatures than most people did -- 400 or so, starting when he was a teenager. In time, eight presidents and several first ladies signed Cornwell's autograph album. So did Mark Twain, Harry Houdini and Thomas A. Edison. For decades, well into his own middle age, Cornwell had a knack for turning up where well-known people were and persuading them to sign. Sometimes they did more than that. Herman Melville wrote a quote from Shakespeare. Oscar Wilde quoted his own poetry. John Philip Sousa wrote three measures of ""The Stars and Stripes Forever."" Mary Todd Lincoln signed ""Mrs. Abraham Lincoln,"" which David Lowenherz, a collector and dealer, said was unusual. After her husband's assassination, she usually just signed ""Mary Lincoln,"" Mr. Lowenherz said.

""Cornwell somehow ingratiated himself into so many different situations,"" Mr. Lowenherz added. ""It was unusual to get more than a signature. He must have said more than, 'Mr. Melville, would you sign my book?'"" Mr. Lowenherz plans to sell the Cornwell autograph album on Wednesday through the online auction platform invaluable.com. The presale estimate is $30,000 to $35,000.

When Cornwell approached the actress Sarah Bernhardt, she made a demand, to which he complied: She insisted that her signature be the last in the album, even though it was far from filled when Cornwell boarded her private rail car in 1911. ""I write the last!"" she had announced, according to Cornwell, who spoke to The New York Times for a 1927 article about the album. She signed the last page and then pasted that page to the inside back cover. ""No one must write after me.""

The album began in the 1880s and ended in the 1930s, shortly before Cornwell gave it to a niece. How Cornwell organized the signatures in the book is as unclear as how he obtained so many -- they are not in chronological order. Melville and the oil and railroad magnate Edward Stiles Stokes signed on the same day, but 12 pages apart. President James A. Garfield's son put his signature beneath his mother's -- at least 20 years after she had signed. Mr. Lowenherz attempted to unravel the mysteries of the album by creating spreadsheets tracking Cornwell's travels. But for all the famous people Cornwell encountered, he himself remains a question mark. ""Here's a guy who's so undocumented that it makes his ability to show up and be allowed in to get these autographs all the more astonishing,"" Mr. Lowenherz said.

This helped him get around.

Real Estate,A San Francisco District Begins to Reduce Blight,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/realestate/commercial/revived-project-lifts-bayview-a-blighted-san-francisco-area.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- The names of the city's storied neighborhoods roll off the tongue: Pacific Heights, North Beach, the Mission, Haight-Ashbury, the Castro. Bayview, a historically African-American district long isolated between Candlestick Park and the former naval shipyard at Hunter's Point along the city's southeastern waterfront, is not among them. The neighborhood's decline was hastened by the decommissioning of the shipyard in the 1970s. A succession of San Francisco mayors -- including Dianne Feinstein, Willie Brown and Gavin Newsom -- sought to revitalize the area. But for decades, the Bayview remained blighted with abandoned warehouses and railroad tracks to nowhere. Now, the completion of a troubled $75 million mixed-use development at 5800 Third Street is evidence that the long-sought revitalization is finally taking root.

Divided into two mixed-use buildings with public courtyards and shared common space, the 315,000-square-foot project's 137 condominium units are priced to appeal to first-time ""work force"" buyers. Holliday Development has sold the entire ground floor, as well as 50 of the 71 units in the first building. Sales of the second building's 66 units are scheduled to begin this month. Prices range from $300,000 for a one-bedroom with a den to the high $400,000s for three-bedroom units. ""This development proves that economic diversity and market-rate housing can work in the Bayview,"" said Olson Lee, the city's director of housing. Mr. Lee also hailed the arrival of three food-related retailers -- Fresh & Easy, a grocery store owned by the British company Tesco, and branches of the popular area restaurants Limon Rotisserie and Brown Sugar Kitchen -- as an equally important milestone for the neighborhood. ""There hasn't been a new grocery store in the Bayview in 20 years,"" Mr. Lee said. ""It was a classic food desert,"" where struggling residents had to leave the neighborhood to find nutritious food and staples. ""These additions will change things,"" he said of the grocery and restaurants. Change for the better has been predicted here for some time. In 2007, it was expected to arrive in the form of a new light-rail line along Third Street, with a stop right across the street from 5800 Third at Carroll Station. The extension linked the formerly isolated neighborhood with jobs in the city's financial district to the north and technology and biotech companies in South San Francisco and Silicon Valley.

That rail expansion, coinciding with a soaring housing market, ignited construction of condominiums in neighborhoods that wrap around the city's eastern shore. The building boom, anchored geographically by the AT&T Ballpark and the Mission Bay research center medical-school campus, transformed a light industrial zone into a series of up-and-coming residential neighborhoods. The boom, however, stopped just short of the Bayview, with its lack of political clout and financial resources. The project at 5800 Third Street was started in 2006 by James D. Noteware of Noteware Development, based in Houston. But the housing market collapsed in 2008, torpedoing Mr. Noteware's effort. ""He was hoping to sell two-bedroom units for $500,000,"" said Rick Holliday, the developer who is finishing the project. ""But in 2008, prices fell by at least 30 percent."" Mr. Noteware did not return calls for comment. Cost overruns and notice of a work stoppage by Thompson Pacific, Noteware's main contractor, rang alarm bells for the project's two financiers, Citi Community Capital, a division of Citicorp, and the equity partner, the Urban Investment Group of Goldman Sachs. Citi, holder of the construction loan, faced $11 million in liens from unpaid subcontractors, a general contractor who had walked off the job and a ground floor with nothing but steel rebar protruding from a concrete slab. Hal Kuykendall, a co-director of Citi Community Capital, had a working relationship with Mr. Holliday, who specializes in affordable housing. Mr. Kuykendall and his partner, Steve Hall, had previously financed a similar ""infill conversion project"" of Mr. Holliday's in a similarly troubled neighborhood -- West Oakland's Pacific Cannery Lofts project. Mr. Hall asked the developer to evaluate the Bayview project in 2008, with an eye to starting it up again. ""We didn't want to leave behind an eyesore,"" said Mr. Kuykendall, whose division is responsible for 90 percent of Citigroup's affordable housing loans, a market segment that F.D.I.C.-insured banks are mandated to serve by the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act. ""We knew the Bayview was at a tipping point and that this project could be transformational."" Mr. Holliday liked what he saw. ""After meeting the residents and getting a deeper sense of the place,"" he said, ""I saw the potential. The Third Street corridor had become the spine of an emerging neighborhood.""

He said the area would have an influx of more than a thousand residents once housing projects nurtured in the downturn by the city's Redevelopment Agency were finished. Mr. Holliday hired a new contractor and landscape architect, modified design elements, untangled the liens and reassured neighborhood advocates and retail investors like Tesco. He also added $700,000 to Goldman Sachs's $20 million equity investment. Mr. Holliday cultivated relationships with Tanya Holland, the owner of Brown Sugar Kitchen in West Oakland, and Martin and Antonio Castillo, brothers who own Limon Rotisserie, a popular Peruvian restaurant established in the city's Mission District. In an important step, Mr. Holliday convinced the restaurateurs to buy rather than lease their space and helped them navigate financing. One longtime Bayview resident, Angelo King, the executive director of the nonprofit Neighborhood Jobs Initiative, recalls when the area near 5800 Third was little more than a long stretch of abandoned warehouses, a shuttered Coca-Cola factory and a methadone clinic. To Mr. King, these changes do not mean gentrification. ""We need to look at how many working-class African American families who do have income leave because they can't find a middle ground,"" he said. ""The housing stock here was in disrepair and dilapidated. Further away, it was overpriced."" Mr. King, who moved into a three-bedroom unit at 5800 Third last September with his wife and two children, said: ""We need private development in a post-Redevelopment Agency world of government cutbacks. Here, they've built something we can take pride in.""","A $75 million mixed-use project is at the heart of a long-sought upgrading of the Bayview, a declining neighborhood.",4ea0ca38-85e2-54dc-98c9-f5d2439f2395,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/03/14/business/Bayview/Bayview-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=370&w=600&s=e06bc60425a73356389457bbc6d15e0a5564b7d15cdf54564e9ccbb1dd6bd944&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"A $75 million, 137-unit condominium development is scheduled to open at 5800 Third Street in San Francisco.",4ea0ca38-85e2-54dc-98c9-f5d2439f2395,N24News/imgs/4ea0ca38-85e2-54dc-98c9-f5d2439f2395.jpg,7
Food,New Restaurant Offerings Amid the Pandemic,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/15/dining/nyc-restaurant-news.html,"The suspension of indoor dining in New York City ordered by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is a blow to the restaurants struggling to stay afloat and keep their workers employed. Since the pandemic started, many have tried creative solutions like sharing kitchen space or offering meal kits. Some restaurants, like Avena Downtown, have turned their premises into pop-up shops, or opened markets adjacent to their spaces. Others are joining forces to sell food from their menus, or to become restaurants within restaurants; Osteria Morini, Lafayette and Frenchette have spun-off bakeries.

Here are a few of the latest initiatives.

The owners of Sushi Noz have opened this market around the corner from the restaurant. Sushi is prepared to order by chefs trained at the restaurant for takeaway, and there is sashimi, nigiri, chirashi assortments and various maki rolls. Sauces and condiments are sold. The store also has a large fresh seafood selection, including Tasmanian salmon, Arctic char, several kinds of tuna, clams, shrimp, caviar and uni. But you'll have to reckon with fairly steep prices.

Among the more recent places offering assorted goods for home cooking is this Prospect Heights restaurant, which has various ingredients, prepared foods and assortments. The Scandinavian hygge-style kit includes a blanket and hot toddy mix, among other items to provide coziness.

Dishes like beef bourguignon are not everyday takeout, but they're among the specialties here. And on Dec. 20 from noon to 6 p.m., the restaurant will set up an outdoor market with items like soups and hot pies to take away or eat on the spot. Other purveyors will also be on hand with maple products, oyster kits, bread, pasta and more.","Though indoor dining has been suspended indefinitely in New York City, many restaurants continue to seek out creative ways to stay afloat.

Health,How a Tsunami in Japan Endangered Children in Cambodia,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/15/health/tsunami-japan-cambodia-iodine-defiency.html,"The tsunami and nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Japan, now threatens the developing brains of children in Cambodia -- but not for reasons that were ever expected. Cambodia has long struggled with iodine deficiency. The element is crucial to early brain growth: When pregnant women and their infants have low levels, the children can permanently lose 10 to 15 I.Q. points. Iodine deficiency is considered the world's leading preventable cause of mental impairment. But there is a cheap, easy remedy: iodized salt. As salt is cleaned and packaged, potassium iodate may be sprayed on it, normally at a cost of only a dollar or two per ton. That means, nutrition experts say, that the I.Q. of entire nations can be raised 10 points for just a nickel per child per year.

Cambodia was making great progress against iodine deficiency until 2011, according to a report published in 2015 by the Iodine Global Network, a public-private partnership combating the deficiency. Like many countries with regular flooding, Cambodia's soil has little natural iodine, so its crops also contain little. In 1997, according to Unicef, almost a fifth of its population had goiters -- swollen thyroid glands in the neck that indicate serious deficiency, which can also cause dwarfism and cretinism. In 1999, with help from donors, Cambodia began iodizing table salt. In 2003, the Parliament and king made it mandatory. Dozens of small producers in Kampot and Kep provinces who made salt by evaporating seawater formed a cooperative that was given potassium-iodate spraying machines. From 2000 to 2011, use of iodized salt rose to 70 percent from 13 percent of households, according to a 2015 study in the journal Nutrients. Market sampling in 2008 found only 1 percent of salt with no detectable iodine. But then things began falling apart. In 2010, Unicef and other donors turned responsibility for iodination over to the government and salt producers. Enforcement grew lax, and spraying machines that broke went unrepaired, according to a recent VOA News article.

Then in 2011, after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the global price of iodine tripled. The price increase had multiple causes, said Roland Kupka, a Unicef micronutrients expert. Global iodine stocks were already low because of the 2008 recession. A third of the world's iodine is produced by Japan's natural gas drillers, who extract it from brine pumped from coastal wells. The catastrophe damaged wells, set refineries ablaze and sharply cut electricity output. Adding to the problem, the release of radioactive iodine from the Fukushima nuclear reactor set off panic buying of protective potassium iodide pills, especially in the western United States. Prices briefly reached 50 times their normal levels.

Raw iodine prices remained high for two years, forcing the Indian companies that make potassium iodate to plead for donor help. Iodine is also used in X-ray machines, LCD screens and pharmaceuticals. Iodized salt accounted for only a tiny market share, so producers could not match other buyers' bids. The whole global iodination effort ""may be put in jeopardy unless action is taken,"" a 2011 report prepared for Unicef said. High prices also wreaked havoc on Cambodia's salt industry. Noniodized salt from Vietnam was half the cost, so it was smuggled in. Salt meant for the Kampot co-op was sold without iodination.

Some wholesalers who were supposed to test salt before repackaging it for retailers stopped doing so. In 2014, scientists from Unicef and Cambodia's planning ministry tested 1,862 salt samples bought at dozens of markets. They found that only 1 percent of coarse salt and 23 percent of fine salt met government standards. But monthly reports from the salt co-op said that over 90 percent of its samples did. ""We can be skeptical of the legitimacy of the internal control,"" the Unicef report said. A quick test of 2,300 schoolchildren showed that iodine concentrations in urine had dropped by 30 percent since 2011, and that the problem ""threatens the program's sustainability,"" the authors concluded. Unicef is urging the government to enforce its own laws and do better testing, Dr. Kupka said, and the Kampot co-op has set up a fund to buy potassium iodate in bulk. There is still time to save children from permanent damage, said Jonathan Gorstein, the executive director of the Iodine Global Network. ""The thyroid is a pretty efficient gland at storing iodine,"" he said, so it can take five to 10 years of deficiency before goiters and brain damage return.","The catastrophe set off an unexpected shortage of iodine, leaving children in faraway countries vulnerable to cognitive deficits.",29b92ff2-16db-54e2-be35-2d2b2186fdb5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/16/science/16SCI-GLOBAL2/16SCI-GLOBAL2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=0015dadc2b9d8b194ba11065c277acb497945240094f5f4920c0169d4993c2ca&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Salt producers in Cambodia's Kampot province.

Opinion,Covid-19: Lessons From the Yanomami,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/opinion/yanomami-covid-brazil.html,"The Yanomami people are no strangers to fatal epidemics, and yet on April 9, many around the world were shocked to learn that Covid-19 had taken its first victim among this relatively isolated Indigenous people of the Amazon rainforest along the Brazil-Venezuela border. Alvaney Xirixana was a 15-year-old boy from the Helepe community of the Rio Uraricoera river basin in the Brazilian state of Roraima, a region afflicted by a huge invasion of illegal gold miners. Malnourished and anemic from successive bouts of malaria, the teenager began showing characteristic respiratory symptoms in mid-March. For 21 days he was admitted four times to a local health care facility, three times receiving treatment for other diseases and the fourth time being discharged. He was finally given a coronavirus test on April 3, when he was hospitalized yet again, this time in critical condition. He died three days later. A victim of the absurd negligence of local health services, he probably infected numerous other members of his community as well as health care workers during those three wasted weeks before he was tested. This appalling episode has raised the specter of a major new health disaster among the Yanomami people. And it is a warning for other Indigenous people of the Amazon. Today, we are all frightened about Covid-19. What we're feeling is perhaps not unlike what the Yanomami have historically experienced when faced with the mysterious and lethal epidemics that our world has inflicted on them.

Since their initial contacts with outsiders beginning in the 1940s, the Yanomami have lived through wave after wave of deadly viral epidemics, notably the measles and flu. The expansion of the internal colonization frontier intensified in the 1970s when Brazil's military dictatorship opened the Perimetral Norte highway in Yanomami territory. Since the late 1980s, Yanomami lands have suffered from regular invasions by illegal gold miners, who have unleashed epidemics of malaria, flu, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases. Over 20,000 garimperos, or illegal miners, are currently devastating Yanomami lands. These invaders, who are nearly as numerous as the Yanomami themselves (current population 26,780), are most likely responsible for introducing the coronavirus to the region. Even amid the pandemic, illegal mining operations have continued to expand. More generally, rainforest destruction throughout the Brazilian Amazon has accelerated, with deforestation alerts for the first three months of 2020 increasing 51 percent over the same period last year. In this context of increasing lawlessness and invasion, Indigenous people throughout Brazil face an intensified risk of infection. So far, over 80 Indigenous people in Brazil have been found to have Covid-19, and seven have died -- Mr. Xirixana, three other members of different ethnic groups in the Amazon interior, as well as three residents of the city of Manaus, including an Indigenous health care worker. Yet given the precarious state of Indigenous health care, there are most likely many more cases. The disease appears to be spreading quickly in poor Indigenous ghettos on the outskirts of large Amazonian cities like Manaus and Belem, which were already overburdened by an influx of Venezuelan Indigenous refugees. The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on such urban Indigenous people has been overlooked in the general flood of data.

The roughly 900,000 Indigenous people are among the most vulnerable to this epidemic in Brazil. Abandoned by weak, underfunded national institutions, some Indigenous communities have taken it upon themselves to close off their villages or isolate themselves in town as best they can, suspending social and political activities and distributing prevention materials in their native languages. The Yanomami, one of the largest and most well-known Indigenous communities of the Amazon, continue to suffer from inadequate health care and a persistent climate of indifference, negligence and lawlessness concerning the invasion of their lands by miners. The press, the global scientific community and Indigenous peoples themselves must continue to expose such negligence and denounce violations of constitutionally guaranteed rights. And yet given the chaotic response of President Jair Bolsonaro's administration to the pandemic throughout Brazil, on top of its open hostility to science, Indigenous peoples and the environment, there seems little hope of significant policy change in the short term. But something fundamental has changed: We are all united by a tragedy that is unfolding around the world. We still know little about this disease. We do know that the origins of the new virus appear related to habitat destruction and the commercialization of wild animals. But we don't yet have immunity, drugs or vaccines to stop it. We are reduced to confining ourselves at home with our families in the hope of evading infection. In some way it reminds me of the stories the Yanomami elders have told me about times when they fled to the forest in small groups to hide from the cannibalistic ""Epidemic Spirit,"" Xawarari. However this time, we have become our own victims by loosing on ourselves the epidemiological consequences of this predatory hubris, just as Indigenous leaders like Yanomami shaman and philosopher Davi Kopenawa have been warning us for decades. In today's hyperconnected industrial world, ecological imbalances or disease vectors that might once have affected only one corner of the planet now threaten us all. And perhaps now, as we are all now exposed to an invisible new enemy for which we have no defenses, this harrowing experience of our shared fragility may stir global society to rethink its current course. Bruce Albert, an anthropologist, has worked among the Yanomami in Brazil since 1975. He is a co-author with Davi Kopenawa of ""The Falling Sky: Words of a Yanomami Shaman.""

Media,Warner Bros. and Lego Enter Market Where Toys and Gaming Meet,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/business/media/warner-bros-and-lego-enter-market-where-toys-and-gaming-meet.html,"BURBANK, Calif. -- Warner Bros. and Lego are deploying Batman, Marty McFly, the Wicked Witch of the West and other movie characters in search of profits in the booming area of entertainment known as ""toys to life."" Warner, which has three Lego movies in the works, on Thursday unveiled a gaming and toy initiative called Lego Dimensions. Lego will sell collectible movie-character mini-figures, which Dimensions players, using a Lego sensor base, can bring to life in a Warner-published video game. The companies plan to release Dimensions worldwide starting on Sept. 27. David Haddad, general manager of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, called Dimensions ""a very ambitious project with enormous expansion opportunity."" To add heft, Warner has recruited character reinforcements from competing studios. Universal has licensed ""Back to the Future"" characters, for instance. Characters owned by 20th Century Fox are also expected to join Dimensions as it rolls out. Highlighting Mr. Haddad's bullishness, Dimensions starter kits will cost about $100, or roughly 30 percent more than a competing product from Disney.

By some measures, Warner and Lego are late to this party. Activision Blizzard created the toys-to-life market in 2011 with its wildly popular Skylanders, which is now on a fourth incarnation and has generated $3 billion in sales. Disney arrived in 2013 with Infinity, which, analysts estimate, has sales nearing $1 billion, enough to turn around an entire Disney division. Infinity players mash together characters from Pixar, Disney and Marvel movies. A ""Star Wars"" version of Infinity is expected next. Late last year, Nintendo arrived with its own figurine-based game called Amiibo. As a category, toys-to-life sales in the United States totaled $671.3 million last year, a 64 percent increase from 2012, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm. But Dimensions signals the first time that a toy giant has arrived on this scene, said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities. ""There is still plenty of room for Warner and Lego,"" he said. ""This category is just getting started. You've got to imagine all the big toy franchises -- Hot Wheels, Barbie, G.I. Joe, Transformers -- looking very closely at this same opportunity.""
* Elizabeth Holmes Hones Her Defense in Day 2 of Testimony
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations. Dimensions reflects two strategies at Warner. In October, Kevin Tsujihara, who took over as the studio's chief executive in 2013, emphasized Lego as one of a handful of movie franchises receiving a cross-company push. ""The Lego Movie,"" released last year, took in $468.8 million worldwide. ""Ninjago,"" another Lego film, is scheduled to arrive next year, with two more brick-building movies in the pipeline. Mr. Tsujihara, who previously oversaw Warner's home entertainment division, including video games, has also promised ""meaningful growth"" from consumer products. ""Disney's success with Marvel and other franchises shows us what's possible,"" Mr. Tsujihara said at a recent investor presentation.

Movie studios have struggled to gain a foothold in gaming, but Warner's track record has been better than most. Warner Interactive, home to games like Batman: Arkham City and the Mortal Kombat series, is expected to generate $1.5 billion in gaming sales this year. Warner also has a popular line of traditional Lego games. Work on Dimensions started more than two years ago, according to Jeff Junge, a senior vice president at Warner who oversees all things Lego at the studio. ""This is not a copycat of something else,"" he said. ""It's important to Lego that Dimensions is bigger and better and richer and deeper."" What justifies the price? ""The amount of playability, and the embedded brick-building,"" Mr. Haddad said. ""In that sense, it's not very comparable to what else is out there."" Warner declined to say how much it spent to develop Dimensions. Along with the sensor pad, each starter kit will come with a Lego Batmobile and three Lego mini-figures: Batman, Wyldstyle from ""The Lego Movie,"" and Gandalf from ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Hobbit"" films. The kits will also include Lego bricks to build an elaborate ""gateway"" on top of the sensor pad, but players must accomplish tasks in the video game to unlock the building instructions. Add-on characters, vehicles and tools will be sold separately at prices ranging from about $15 to $30. Dimensions, intended for family play but aimed at boys ages 7 to 10, is available for various Xbox, PlayStation and Wii devices. ""A lot of details are still to come,"" said Jon Burton, founder and creative director of Warner's TT Games, which developed Dimensions. ""We're having to unveil it in stages, so we don't just flood people and overwhelm them.""","The studio unveiled a product called Dimensions, involving collectible movie-character mini-figures that can be brought to life in a video game.",08c23895-5f80-5bb7-a903-60fcd2483a95,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/10/business/10warner-web1/10warner-web1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=daa96f2dc95d0a0421267132f9cb29b726e969ac1ece2a9070bd573ff883ff1e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An image from a Lego Dimensions video game.

Health,Breast Milk Is Teeming With Bacteria — That's Good for the Baby,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/health/breastmilk-microbiome-parenting.html,"The numbers of bacteria in breast milk are relatively low, but breast-feeding seems to have an outsize impact in populating a baby's microbiome with good bacteria.



In the earliest days after birth, millions of bacteria make their home in a baby's body -- in the skin, mouth and especially the gut. These immigrants come from the birth canal and the mother's feces (during a vaginal birth), the mother's skin and mouth as she holds and nuzzles the baby and perhaps even from the placenta, although that source is still debated. The colonizing microbiome can have a far-reaching impact on the baby's health. Studies have suggested, for instance, that the populace of a baby's microbiome in the first two years of life may predict later risk of obesity. Children born by cesarean section are also more likely to become obese, or to develop autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and asthma. Lately , scientists have identified another major contributor to the infant microbiome. Breast milk, it turns out, is teeming with bacteria that colonize the infant's gut, and could help set the course for the baby's growing immune system and metabolism. Moreover, breast milk seems to be rich in beneficial bacteria only when it comes directly from the mother's breast -- not even when the same milk is pumped and delivered later by bottle. Pumped milk still carries most other riches of breast milk. Nevertheless, this news about the microbiome, emerging from studies done in the past few years, taps into a fraught issue for many women: medical recommendations and societal pressure to breast-feed, combined with policies, or physical problems, that often make it all but impossible to do so .

Especially for the gut microbiome of older babies, ""the number one thing that influences that composition is what they're being fed,"" said Meghan Azad, a pediatric researcher and epidemiologist at the University of Manitoba. ""In some ways that message isn't for individual moms, but for society overall: Breast-feeding is very important."" The idea of a breast milk microbiome, and of its importance, is only just beginning to take root. The numbers of bacteria in breast milk are much lower than in stool, the usual route to sample gut bacteria, and scientists lacked the tools to analyze breast milk. As the technology has matured, researchers have found that breast-feeding seems to have an outsize impact, populating the baby's microbiome with good bacteria. It's well known by now that babies born by cesarean section miss out on many helpful bacteria. And antibiotic use in the mother or baby can also obliterate the baby's nascent bacterial populations. Breast-feeding can compensate to some extent. ""Those instructions come very early in life,"" said Jed Friedman, director of the Harold Hamm Diabetes Center at the University of Oklahoma. ""The problem becomes if you can't breast-feed and are switching to formula, and maybe you're getting antibiotics -- if you wipe out all these sources then you'll see big changes. When you add all those together it's a triple whammy.""

A recent series of studies has cast light on a particularly beneficial type of microbe, called bifidobacteria. Groundbreaking work published in 2012 by Omry Koren, who runs the Microbiome Research Lab at Bar-Ilan University in Israel, showed that the microbiome evolves during pregnancy. Over time, it becomes similar to a state that resembles inflammation and metabolic syndrome -- a condition associated with heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes. In April, Dr. Koren's team showed that, late in pregnancy, bifidobacteria sense a gestational hormone called progesterone and proliferate in response, as if preparing for the breast-feeding phase. ""We actually think there is a sort of evolutionary mechanism here, which basically causes bifidobacterium to grow faster,"" Dr. Koren said. ""The fact that bacteria can sense human hormones and react to those hormones, I think that's pretty fascinating."" Bifidobacteria consume special sugars found in breast milk, called human milk oligosaccharides, that babies cannot otherwise digest. As a result, these bacteria are abundant in the guts of breast-fed infants but not of formula-fed babies. Breast milk has long been known to contain human milk oligosaccharides, but the discovery that they're important for the microbiome to thrive has drawn attention to them. Cows make about 40 different oligosaccharides, and humans make more than 100, although each woman's breast milk contains a subset of that number. A woman's breast milk also contains a unique melange of hormones, antibodies and bacteria -- a brew that presumably evolved to meet the needs of her child. ""It's one of the unique things about human milk that's really hard to replicate,"" Dr. Azad said. ""A formula is an attempt at making something that's one-size-fits-all, essentially."" Formula manufacturers keep up with the science on breast milk, and they strive to mimic the substance as closely as possible. But in the case of oligosaccharides, they may have jumped the gun: Some companies are adding one of the complex sugars, called 2FL, to their products (and are testing many others). However, about 20 percent of women don't produce 2FL in their breast milk. If one of these women gives her baby a formula that contains 2FL, the baby receives a sugar that it would not have received naturally, Dr. Azad said: ""And is that a good thing? Is that a bad thing? We don't really know yet."" Adding just one sugar also may not provide much benefit. Research suggests that only about 10 of the sugars seem to be particularly important for a baby's health -- but only when consumed in combination.

""What is the function of those components if they're isolated and not all in combination with each other?"" said Dr. Andrew Bremer, a pediatric researcher at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, in Bethesda, Md. ""Just adding one to a predefined formula, is that comparable to breast milk? Or, heaven forbid, is it deleterious?"" Breast milk that is pumped and delivered by bottle is generally better than formula, Dr. Azad said. But she had some additional news that some working mothers may find unsettling: Pumped breast milk may not deliver the benefits of the sugars that arrive in breast milk straight from the source. Dr. Azad and her colleagues studied 393 Canadian mother-infant pairs and found that pumped breast milk seems to be richer in some harmful bacteria, and has few bifidobacteria. Many variables can affect the quality of pumped breast milk, including the type of pump, how the milk is stored and the cleanliness of the bottles and nipples. Dr. Azad's work suggests that direct contact between the mother's breast and the baby's mouth is important: When a baby nurses, some denizens of its oral microbiome may traverse back into the mother's breast. In other words, the benefits of breast-feeding may derive from myriad factors, including the many microbiomes in the mother's body -- in the breast milk and on the skin of the breast -- and in the baby's mouth and gut. ""I don't want the message to be that expressed human milk is bad,"" Dr. Bremer said. ""It's that there are other factors involved. When you disrupt that experience of baby sucking on the mom's breast, what do you lose? Or what's gained by that process? The science is more ripe now to start delving into those questions."" Doctors should also exercise caution when prescribing antibiotics to babies or to lactating mothers, he said. There is robust evidence that antibiotics can have a powerful negative effect on the microbiome, shifting the balance toward harmful bacteria. For some women and babies, forgoing antibiotics is not an option. As many as one in four pregnant women are infected with group B strep bacteria, and may need intravenous antibiotics during labor to lower the risk of infecting their babies. Those women are encouraged to minimize the effects on the microbiome by several means, including vaginal delivery, exclusively breast-feeding, providing abundant skin-on-skin contact with the baby, and avoiding giving the infant scented baths, which can disrupt its microbiome.

""Those things, then, really, overwhelmingly promote a beautiful growth of healthy bacteria both on the skin of the baby and in the gut,"" said Sara Edwards, a researcher at Emory University's Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing. Dr. Edwards and her colleagues are following nearly 600 pregnant women to track relationships between their antibiotic use at different stages of gestation and the long-term effects on mother and baby. No definitive patterns have emerged yet, but the changes in the mothers seem to be short-lived. ""It looks as if the body does a pretty good job,"" Dr. Edwards said. ""Especially among people who are healthy and don't have other comorbidities and other immune issues -- that there is a correction that occurs once the antibiotics are over."" Women also should exercise, avoid stress and eat foods that either contain or nourish good bacteria, including yogurt, kefir, kombucha and sauerkraut, she added. ""Things that promote wellness in the mother also produce the richest, healthiest type of diet for the babies' milk,"" Dr. Edwards said. Here again, breast-feeding seems to be what's most helpful. But women who have trouble breast-feeding shouldn't despair, Dr. Azad said. ""One thing that's pretty clear is that there's a dose response, meaning that every bit counts,"" she said. ""So even if you can't do six months of breast-feeding, if you can do partial breast-feeding, or if you can do one month, or one week, that's definitely better than none.""",Breast-fed milk may nourish a baby's microbiome in ways that bottled breast milk can't.,2813d606-b5c8-5580-93cf-aea387061d6e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/25/science/12milkbiome1/12milkbiome1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=0c488ef82d1a5f0c6887ff2146636df59b5ebd5a5af8f56e2e57f49643d101f5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The numbers of bacteria in breast milk are relatively low, but breast-feeding seems to have an outsize impact in populating a baby&rsquo;s microbiome with good bacteria.",2813d606-b5c8-5580-93cf-aea387061d6e,N24News/imgs/2813d606-b5c8-5580-93cf-aea387061d6e.jpg,1
Books,Walter Tevis Was a Novelist. You Might Know His Books (Much) Better as Movies.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/books/walter-tevis-novelist-queens-gambit-netflix.html,"Walter Tevis in 1982. His novel ""The Queen's Gambit"" is the source material for the popular Netflix series of the same name.





Walter Tevis Was a Novelist. You Might Know His Books (Much) Better as Movies.

The wildly popular Netflix series ""The Queen's Gambit"" has done for chess what Julia Child once did for French cooking. Chess set sales have skyrocketed; enrollment in online chess classes has surged. The series has been the subject of hundreds of articles and interviews. The novel that inspired the show, first published in 1983, has been on The New York Times's trade paperback best-seller list for five weeks. Yet little attention has been paid to Walter Tevis, the author whose creation has stirred all the commotion. Tevis once pegged himself as ""a good American writer of the second rank."" But Allan Scott, the screenwriter who first optioned ""The Queen's Gambit"" in the 1980s, disagrees. Mr. Scott co-created and executive-produced the current Netflix show. ""I think very highly of Tevis,"" he said in an email. ""I think he was one of the best American writers of the 20th century. 'The Queen's Gambit' lays out a terrific story very simply. Child, mother killed, orphanage, touch of genius, addiction. It's Dickensian."" (It took decades to bring the book to the screen, Mr. Scott said, because studios thought the subject of chess was a commercial dead-end.)

Tevis was a family man who played board games and fished with his kids; a popular professor of writing and literature at Ohio University in Athens; a cat-lover and movie aficionado; and a talented amateur chess and pool player. He was pale and gangly; some of his students called him ""Ichabod Crane."" He was also a three-pack-a-day smoker, a serious gambler and an alcoholic who made several suicide attempts. His fiction often plumbs his psyche, metaphorically. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

""He's the hero of all his own books,"" said his son, Will Tevis, 66, before correcting himself: ""He's the antihero."" Tevis considered his terrain to be the world of underdogs. ""I write about losers and loners,"" he told this newspaper in 1983. ""If there's a common theme in my work, that's it. I invented the phrase 'born loser' in 'The Hustler.' In one way or another I'm obsessed with the struggle between winning and losing.""

Tevis was born in San Francisco, into what he called a ""feelingless, uptight"" home. His parents moved to Kentucky when he was 10. Because young Walter had a heart condition, his parents left him behind in a convalescent home, where he spent months drugged on phenobarbital like Beth Harmon, the main character in ""The Queen's Gambit."" In an essay published in 1990, Tevis's first wife, Jamie, wrote: ""He never got over the scars of the early experience with narcotics."" Tevis believed that early experience fueled his later alcoholism. When he left California to rejoin his family, Tevis found his new environment bewildering. In a 1981 interview, he said that ""The Man Who Fell to Earth,"" about an alien who lands in Kentucky and can't adjust to life on this planet, was ""disguised autobiography."" ""[It] has to do with my having moved from what I thought was the city of light, San Francisco, when I was 11, to Lexington, Kentucky, where I went to a tough Appalachian school in the fifth grade and was beaten up regularly,"" Tevis said. (Tevis gave the movie version of the book a C-plus, calling it confusing, but when he met David Bowie found him to be ""a wonderful man."") The day he turned 17, Tevis joined the Navy. On a ship home from Okinawa, he met Hilary Knight, who went on to illustrate the Eloise books. The two connected instantly, Mr. Knight, now 94, recalled, because both were ""total misfits."" ""We were two people in a dream world, though his was much more logical than mine,"" Mr. Knight said. ""The other crew paid little or no attention to us. They didn't want to know these weirdos. Walter was too smart, and the ship was full of dumbbells. We had a great time laughing about everything.""

""The Hustler,"" drawn from Tevis's rough-and-tumble pool hall experiences before and after the war, came out in 1959, followed by ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"" in 1963. Then, Tevis published almost nothing until 1980. He and his wife, whom he met when they taught at the same high school, raised two children while Tevis was at Ohio University. He played chess and shot pool, often with his colleague Daniel Keyes, who wrote ""Flowers for Algernon."" Tevis drank heavily and his marriage suffered. Even so, his children remember Tevis as a devoted parent.

His daughter, Julia McGory, 63, said that his kids had experienced some of ""the sadness and complexities of our father,"" but ""never doubted how much he loved us and enjoyed being with us."" In the mid-1970s, Tevis sobered up, partly with help from Alcoholics Anonymous. Deeply frustrated by his writer's block, he got a divorce and decided to try his creative luck in Manhattan. He began a relationship with, and eventually married, Eleanora Walker, who worked for his agent. He reconnected with Mr. Knight: ""We became great friends again,"" Mr. Knight said. Tevis also regained his writerly mojo, finishing four more novels and a collection of short stories. He helped convince Paul Newman to star in the movie version of ""The Color of Money."" He also wrote ""The Queen's Gambit"" during those years. The writer Tobias Wolff called it an ""overlooked masterpiece."" ""Tevis has a gift for vivid characterization and propulsive narratives,"" Mr. Wolff said in an email. ""His style is direct and efficient, never calling attention to itself; yet it grows in power through the course of a novel by its very naturalness."" Describing young Beth learning a chess move in ""The Queen's Gambit,"" Tevis wrote: ""She decided not to take the offered pawn, to leave the tension on the board. She liked it like that. She liked the power of the pieces, exerted along files and diagonals. In the middle of the game, when the pieces were everywhere, the forces crisscrossing the board thrilled her. She brought out her king's knight, feeling its power spread."" More lyrically, as Beth sits bored in class, Tevis wrote that her ""mind danced in awe to the geometric rococo of chess, rapt, enraptured, drawing in the grand permutations as they opened to her soul, and her soul opened to them."" In the book, Beth is a harder-edged, less obviously triumphant character than in the Netflix series. Tevis once explained why he made the choice to portray a female chess champion. ""Sometimes I was really more wrapped up in the idea of intelligence in women, for which I have an enormous respect and a kind of awe, more wrapped up in that even than the game of chess itself,"" he said.","In addition to ""The Queen's Gambit,"" adapted into the current Netflix hit, Walter Tevis wrote the novels ""The Hustler,"" ""The Color of Money"" and ""The Man Who Fell to Earth.""",3d4604b9-dd57-5d16-89c9-347e1734208b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/28/books/27queensgambitbook/27queensgambitbook-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,Walter Tevis in 1982.

Automobiles,Custom Look at an Off-the-Rack Price,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/automobiles/autoreviews/custom-look-at-an-off-the-rack-price.html,"The motorcycle industry, still recovering from a steep sales slump, has been asking what sort of motorcycles people are ready, willing and able to buy. After much data crunching, the product planners at Yamaha decided that while there are many potential customers, the price needed to be irresistible.

""Guys can no longer go to the bank and take out a home equity line or a second mortgage to buy that $50,000 chopper of their dreams,"" said Mike Ulrich, a Yamaha engineer. ""But they still want to ride. They just need something affordable.""

The Bolt is described as a back-to-basics bobber, a type of home-brew motorcycle whose origins date to the years after World War II.

Health,"Crispr Gene Editing Can Cause Unwanted Changes in Human Embryos, Study Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/31/health/crispr-genetics-embryos.html,"A powerful gene-editing tool called Crispr-Cas9, which this month nabbed the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for two female scientists, can cause serious side effects in the cells of human embryos, prompting them to discard large chunks of their genetic material, a new study has found. Administered to cells to repair a mutation that can cause hereditary blindness, the Crispr-Cas9 technology appeared to wreak genetic havoc in about half the specimens that the researchers examined, according to a study published in the journal Cell on Thursday. The consequences of these errors can be quite serious in some cases, said Dieter Egli, a geneticist at Columbia University and an author of the study. Some cells were so flummoxed by the alterations that they simply gave up on trying to fix them, jettisoning entire chromosomes, the units into which human DNA is packaged, Dr. Egli said. ""We're often used to hearing about papers where Crispr is very successful,"" said Nicole Kaplan, a geneticist at New York University who was not involved in the study. ""But with the amount of power we hold"" with this tool, Dr. Kaplan said, it is crucial ""to understand consequences we didn't intend.""

Crispr-Cas9, a scissorslike chemical tool that can precisely cut and customize stretches of genetic material, such as human DNA, stoked international controversy in 2018 when He Jiankui, a Chinese scientist, used the technology to yield the world's first gene-edited infants. The experiment was widely condemned as irresponsible and dangerous -- in large part because many of the ways in which Crispr-Cas9 can affect cells remain poorly understood. Dr. He was found guilty of conducting illegal medical practices in China and sentenced to three years in prison. The new paper's findings further underscore that ""it's really too soon to be applying Crispr to reproductive genetics,"" said Nita Farahany, a bioethicist at Duke University who was not involved in the study. Crispr-Cas9 treatments have already been given directly to people to treat conditions like blindness -- a potential cure that affects that patient, and that patient only. But modifications made to sperm, eggs and embryos can be passed to future generations, raising the stakes for any mistakes made along the way. Although scientists have been tinkering with genomes for decades, Crispr-Cas9 can accomplish a precise type of genetic surgery that other tools cannot. Scientists can use Crispr-Cas9 to home in on a specific region of the genome and snip it in two. Sensing trouble, the cell rushes to heal its genetic wound, sometimes using a similar-looking stretch of nearby, intact DNA as a template as it stitches the pieces back together. This gives researchers an opportunity to splice in a tailor-made template of their own, in the hopes that the cell will incorporate the intended change.

In 2017, a team of researchers led by Shoukhrat Mitalipov, a geneticist at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, reported that human embryos carrying a mutation could be coaxed into this process without a synthetic template. The researchers generated embryos from a union between two cells: a sperm carrying a mutation that can make it harder for the heart to pump blood, and an egg with a healthy version of the gene. Dr. Mitalipov and his team used Crispr-Cas9 to cut the broken copy of the gene to see if the intact version would guide its repair. They reported the experiment a success and published it in the journal Nature. ""In principle, this could be a way to correct a mutation in a human embryo"" that has only one broken copy of a gene, Dr. Egli said. But the new findings could cast some doubt on the 2017 work, Dr. Egli added. The researchers of the Cell study focused on a different mutation -- one that causes hereditary blindness and affects a different part of the genome -- but adopted a similar setup. Using donated sperm containing a mutation in a gene called EYS, they fertilized eggs that had normal copies of EYS, then sent in Crispr-Cas9 to snip the mutation. Several of the cells managed to sew the Crispr-cut pieces of DNA back together with a few minor changes, Dr. Egli said. But about half the embryos seemed unable to cope with the trauma of the break. The genetic damage failed to heal, eventually forcing cells to tear off and toss aside large chunks of the chromosome that harbored the mutated EYS. In some cells, the entire chromosome was lost. ""That is not a correction,"" Dr. Egli said. ""That is a vastly different outcome."" Instead of gently goading the cell into editing the genetic ""text"" at which it was targeted, the Crispr machinery gouged irreparable gaps in cells' DNA, said Maria Jasin, a geneticist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and another author of the study. The negative consequences of this, she added, were disproportionately disastrous. ""They were talking about trying to repair one gene, and you have a substantial fraction of the genome being changed,"" Dr. Jasin said. Dr. Egli and Dr. Jasin said that this probably happened in Dr. Mitalipov's 2017 paper as well, but it went unnoticed. After Dr. Mitalipov's team carried out their Crispr-Cas9 treatment, they could no longer detect the mutation in embryos. But Dr. Egli and Dr. Jasin noted that, technically, dumping or destroying a huge segment of a chromosome would have wiped out evidence of the mutation as well. Dr. Mitalipov and his team, they said, might have mistaken a deletion for an edit.

Dr. Mitalipov disagreed with this interpretation, and he said the new paper's conclusions were not fully backed up by the necessary data. ""They don't have evidence to show these are deletions,"" he said. Far more complex experiments, he said, would be needed to conclusively distinguish a ""corrected"" chromosome from an absent one. Dr. Kaplan, of New York University, said she found the new paper's findings convincing. And she, like all of the other experts who spoke with The New York Times, echoed a crucial sentiment: that Crispr-editing embryos in the clinic must remain a far-off reality, if it is ever approved at all. ""At this point, it's too dangerous,"" Dr. Jasin said. ""We're just not sure which way things are going to go."" The U.S. government does not permit the use of federal funds to conduct research on human embryos. Dr. Egli's team sought private funding from the New York Stem Cell Foundation and the Russell Berrie Foundation Program in cellular therapies to run its experiments. Other Crispr-based technologies exist that could circumvent several of the issues the team identified. For example, some researchers have developed techniques that allow them to make less drastic cuts to the genome and tinker with just one genetic letter at a time. Given his team's findings, Dr. Egli also floated the idea that the blunter version of Crispr-Cas9 could someday be deployed as a sort of molecular bomb: shredding and eliminating unwanted, extra chromosomes when they appear in embryos.

The new study, she said, only builds upon the notion that scientists will need to walk, not run, in developing Crispr tools for reproductive medicine.","Instead of addressing genetic mutations, the Crispr machinery prompted cells to lose entire chromosomes.",a0855f76-b785-5b91-a8cd-75cd9acf5036,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/30/science/30CRISPR/30CRISPR-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=1f0dce33d469c16896d12d29277bc4a6977eb0bc05c81e825f25df6b91bdbb14&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A researcher working with Crispr-Cas9 in a lab in Berlin.,a0855f76-b785-5b91-a8cd-75cd9acf5036,N24News/imgs/a0855f76-b785-5b91-a8cd-75cd9acf5036.jpg,1
Dance,Quivering and Curving,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/15/arts/dance/ivy-baldwin-unveils-oxbow-at-bam-fisher.html,"An oxbow, in case you don't know, is the bend in a river that curves in the shape of a U. It's also the title of Ivy Baldwin's perplexing new dance, the most compelling part of which is its set. Placed toward the back of the stage under purposely murky lighting, the design resembles a gnarled, twisted tree growing on the side of a cliff. Its serpentine lines, some delicate and others knotty with erosion, give this dancing space a well-needed frame.

Performed at BAM Fisher on Thursday, ""Oxbow"" begins not with movement but a piano solo by Ryan Tracy, whose repetitive pounding of notes starts softly before building to more emphatic sounds. A blackout signals the end of this mini-concert and when the lights come back on, Eleanor Smith stands onstage in profile with downcast eyes. As her left arm slowly creeps high above her head, her torso quivers subtly as the hand lowers and trembles over her breastbone.

With Ms. Smith's savory way of dancing, you get the sense that movement is coming from the inside out -- from the nerves, the tendons -- even when the choreography is not especially enthralling. Sadly, in ""Oxbow,"" that kind of internal drive is felt only intermittently with the others, including Anna Carapetyan, Mr. Tracy, Katie Workum and Luke Miller (filling in for an ill Lawrence Cassella).

More often than not, ""Oxbow"" is less a complete dance than a movement study with patched-together phrases dressed up in Alice Ritter's red, white and black costumes and plopped into Wade Kavanaugh and Stephen B. Nguyen's installation. There's a feigned rawness to the choreography, which randomly sends dancers spinning in space or balancing on one leg, off-kilter, with a sickled foot. Instead of truly manifesting awkwardness, they are poseurs of inelegance.","Ivy Baldwin's ""Oxbow,"" at BAM Fisher, is less a complete dance than a movement study with patched-together phrases.",bf0be831-a518-5bae-ad0b-47008a9f4519,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/15/arts/oxbox/oxbox-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=421&w=600&s=6a116e8fba4b1fbe6a4f5f64b1efd1ab1106984afe68c2e57530e247024da14f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"From left: Luke Miller, Katie Workum, Ryan Tracy, Anna Carapetyan perform ""Oxbow"" at BAM Fisher.",bf0be831-a518-5bae-ad0b-47008a9f4519,N24News/imgs/bf0be831-a518-5bae-ad0b-47008a9f4519.jpg,6
Automobiles,"The Web-Connected Car Is Cool, Until Hackers Cut Your Brakes",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/24/business/the-web-connected-car-is-cool-until-hackers-cut-your-brakes.html,"WHEN the history of the connected car is written, this week may go down as a pivotal moment for consumers worried about security. That is because a pair of technology researchers said that they had wirelessly hacked a Jeep Cherokee through its Internet-connected system, allowing them to take control of critical components like the engine, brakes and even steering under certain conditions. The revelation left automakers scrambling to reassure their customers that security was a top priority, and Fiat Chrysler said that a software patch it had released a week earlier was designed to plug the hole used by the same two researchers, who had alerted the company before going public. But the breach showed just how vulnerable the new breeds of web-connected vehicles can be, and the challenges that manufacturers face in defending against the types of attacks common in other technology fields.

""Customers are demanding new capabilities and more technology, so the risk is only going to increase for vehicles,"" said Jon Allen, a web security expert at Booz Allen Hamilton. Auto manufacturers, he said, ""know they need to get ahead of this from a security perspective."" Such a web-enabled threat is relatively new for the industry: Complex computer software has been used for years to power cars' performance, but those computerized brains were always walled off inside the cars themselves; they were not connected to the wider world. For example, when the same researchers, Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, hacked into a Ford Escape in 2013, they could do so only by plugging a cord directly into the vehicle. Now, the need for a cord is gone. About 27 million vehicles worldwide are now connected to the Internet, and that number is predicted to triple by 2022, to more than 82 million, according to IHS Automotive. ""The reality is that this is something that needs to be on the forefront of the industry's radar,"" said Akshay Anand, an analyst at Kelley Blue Book. ""It's not talked about as much as it should be."" The issue has also gotten the attention of lawmakers on Capitol Hill. In February, Senator Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, released a report that found only a handful of automakers had systems in place to even detect a hacking intrusion. Mr. Markey, together with Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, has also drafted legislation to establish federal web security standards for automobiles.

A video and article posted by the technology news site Wired showed just how helpless a driver would be in a hacking attack. As the Jeep Cherokee barreled down a St. Louis highway at 70 miles an hour, the driver, who participated in the experiment, was rendered helpless to control the air-conditioning fan, radio, windshield wipers and the car's digital display. The two hackers, sitting with a laptop in a basement 10 miles away, took control of them all, even cutting the engine at one point and bringing the Jeep to a stop as traffic whizzed by. Later, they also cut the brakes. Mr. Valasek, in an interview, said he and Mr. Miller spent nearly two years trying to crack the puzzle. Chrysler, like many automakers, has said it designs its entertainment and wireless connectivity system to be separate from the system that controls automotive functions of the car, like the engine and brakes. But the two men have proved that a bridge from one to the other is possible. ""Probably to them it was two separate things,"" Mr. Valasek said, referring to Chrysler's engineers. ""But people like us think differently, and we thought how it could work until we found the way."" The pair's hacking technique is not applicable only to Jeeps, Mr. Valasek said. It could have been used on any Fiat Chrysler vehicle using its Uconnect entertainment and wireless connectivity system. ""Five years ago, the auto industry did not consider cybersecurity as a near-term problem,"" said Egil Juliussen, senior analyst and research director with IHS Automotive. ""This view has changed."" Fiat Chrysler said that it ""monitors and tests the information systems of all of its products to identify and eliminate vulnerabilities in the ordinary course of business."" The company said that its new software patch had closed the security hole the two men had identified.

Other automakers sought to reassure their customers as well. General Motors said in a statement that ""our customers' safety and security is paramount, and we are taking a multifaceted approach to secure in-vehicle and connected-vehicle systems."" The company said it was ""designing vehicle systems that can be updated with enhanced security as these potential threats arise."" Volvo said its cars were ""designed with several layers of protection in hardware and software"" and ""enhanced with encryption and security protocols that are unique to each individual car. This process serves to prevent the remote access and disablement of critical systems."" An Audi spokesman described security as a high priority and said the company intended to ""constantly protect our cars and customers against vulnerability risks."" Mr. Anand, the Kelley Blue Book analyst, said the future was likely to be one where constant vigilance would be required. That could mean something akin to running antivirus software on computers -- where intrusion threats are being monitored in real time, both by consumers themselves and by automakers. ""Automakers will need to be watching this around the clock to spot threats right away,"" he said. ""And we could see warnings for drivers as well, when suspected intrusions are detected."" Mr. Allen, the web security expert with Booz Allen Hamilton, said automakers would most likely have to develop some kind of safe, ""disconnected"" mode that drivers could immediately revert to if a threat were flagged, so the vehicle would be cut off from the web. He said that as new features were introduced and software updates offered, consumers should also get more control over whether they want to use them.","A pair of researchers said that they had hacked a Jeep Cherokee through its Internet-connected system, allowing them to take control of the engine, brakes and even steering.",39d20ab0-aa5d-54b7-9b56-7d51e04cda3a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/24/business/24WHEELS/24WHEELS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=42a78d57492c9ebc06d342facf65fe9cd063d7d8df1f7761e4b5388cc9971891&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Charlie Miller, pictured, and Chris Valasek have found a way to hack into a Jeep Cherokee's Uconnect system to control critical components, including the engine and brakes.",39d20ab0-aa5d-54b7-9b56-7d51e04cda3a,N24News/imgs/39d20ab0-aa5d-54b7-9b56-7d51e04cda3a.jpg,23
Art & Design,Say You Want to Build a Monolith,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/12/arts/design/how-to-build-a-monolith.html,"Stuck inside, looking at social media on your phone, bored with what's on streaming, it could start to seem like a good idea. A monolith, you might reason, could add a glimmer of mystery to your local wilderness, might make people laugh, or at least distract them with a literal shiny object. They've appeared in Utah, California and Romania. There's a three-foot one in downtown Fayetteville, N.C., and one on a beach of England's Isle of Wight. Of course, there are plenty of reasons not to build a monolith. Like legality: Trespassing on private land aside, it's also illegal to install structures without authorization in many places, including on Utah's millions of acres of federally managed public land, where a 10-foot, stainless steel object was found last month, inspiring copycats around the world. Metalwork can be dangerous without training, and a large, unstable metal object could pose a danger to the people around it -- and the environment. There are cheaper, easier, more clearly legal and less hazardous ways to pass the time (books, walks, projects that don't involve monoliths). But still, people are making monoliths. And your own property is your own property. So if your front lawn's holiday decorations are crying out for one, here are some things to think about.

The other monoliths as models It remains unknown how many people have built monoliths because they have backyards and easygoing neighbors, rooms with high ceilings or ambitions for only small monoliths that could, for instance, loom mysteriously over the dinner table. The best-known monoliths, the ones you've seen all those headlines about, have been built on more contested ground. After the Utah monolith was found, the Bureau of Land Management said that it ""would like to remind public land visitors that using, occupying, or developing the public lands or their resources without a required authorization is illegal."" And building a monolith seems to invite the dismantling of a monolith, if not by the authorities, then by regular people. Other objects have been removed, shortly after discovery, from a parking lot in San Diego, a mountain in Atascadero, Calif., and a plateau in Romania. The Utah monolith had stainless steel pieces fastened with rivets, officials said. Its interior, exposed in a video of four men carting the monolith away in the dead of night, appeared to show a plywood frame.

""The sizes aren't so bizarre,"" Mr. Bissinger said. ""You could order them and no one would say, 'Oh, are you building a monolith in the desert?'"" An interior frame can be made of plywood or a material along those lines, cut into a triangular shape with a simple handsaw or a circle saw. More ambitious monolith-builders could use a CNC machine -- a sort of a computer-controlled cutting tool -- to make the frame, Ms. La Scala said, and the metal could be cut into panels by a water jet machine ""to ease the edges so they aren't a rough cut."" A sheet metal brake can bend metal, though maybe not in large segments. A pickup, Jeep or rental truck would probably suffice to move the supplies, Mr. Bissinger said. To install a monolith, the designers said the base could be concrete footing or metal footing like rebar. Or, Mr. Bissinger said, monolith-builders could simply dig a hole below the frost line and fill the bottom with aggregate or sandbags, ""like if you were putting in a mailbox."" Dan Toone, an artist in Salt Lake City, said that photos of the Utah monolith suggested its creators used a concrete saw to cut into the rock, mount a wood or metal framework, and then install the metal sheets on the spot. ""It was very clean and very well done,"" he said. ""Somebody professionally did that."" Over all it's not a terribly expensive process. A lower-end monolith could cost as little as $200 to $300, said Scott Neale, a professor of scenic design at Trinity University. He said that such an object could be completed by someone with ""midlevel skills"" in a theater's scene shop or someone's garage, with metal shears or an acetylene torch.

A more expensive, more involved version could cost $1,000 or $2,000, he said. To strengthen a Utah-style construction, the special-effects artist Jamie Hyneman, who was a longtime host of the show ""Mythbusters,"" said that a builder could coat the wood framing with epoxy to hold the sheet metal, and place another board on top with weights for a few hours to secure the construction. He also outlined another, sturdier version of monolith that would use thick pieces of metal, cast into the corners of the triangular shape, to hold the three panels of metal together. This construction might take some more work, in order to bevel the edges of the sheet metal and create the corner fasteners, but a monolith could still be ready in a day or two. ""You could pretty much specify all this stuff at some machine shop and just assemble it,"" he said. ""It's really kind of a dead simple thing."" He warned that the devil was in the details. Thinner metal could make the monolith seem ""kind of warpy,"" and require countersinking the metal. Cardboard could help prevent scratches while moving the monolith, and rope could help lift it. Rebar drilled into the base and stuck into the ground could secure it. So many kinds of monoliths For purists, a monolith is a single large block, usually made of stone, in the style of an obelisk or a geometric slab, like the rectangular one from ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" That film's director, Stanley Kubrick, originally wanted a transparent object, said David Mikics, a professor at the University of Houston and the author of a Kubrick biography. ""He ordered up an enormous piece of Lucite, the largest Lucite object that had ever been made,"" Mr. Mikics said. But when the object was delivered, Kubrick was disappointed it was not, in fact, completely transparent. So he ordered up a new prop to be painted, over and over again, in a shade of matte black. ""This of course was a great idea, it's just like an abyss,"" Mr. Mikics said.

But most of the monoliths have gone unexplained. Observers largely agreed that, whatever the purpose of the Utah object, the monoliths that followed are imitators by people looking for something to do. ""Festivals are off and theaters are closed,"" Mr. Dorey said. ""Everyone's got time on their hands."" Mr. Hyneman made a similar observation: ""Everybody's got to have a hobby.""",Experts in design and special effects said the monoliths appearing around the world are not that difficult to replicate.

Food,What to Cook This Weekend,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/dining/what-to-cook-this-weekend-newsletter.html,"The old oven in my apartment in Brooklyn was tiny and hideous and stubbornly sloping to one side -- this is Tejal Rao by the way, filling in for Sam. But it worked just fine until about six weeks ago. While I waited for my landlord to send a guy, I made do with an electric pressure cooker. I cooked all kinds of beans (so. many. beans.); I braised fennel hearts and simmered a big batch of Andrea Nguyen's fantastic pho broth.

But not being able to bake for six weeks has put me in such a mood to bake! Now, the oven's been replaced, and I've got the most delicious to-do list for the weekend. Right at the top: Samin Nosrat's soufflazy (above), a glorious, golden, cheesy puff of beaten eggs, herbs and goat cheese that she adapted from her friend Amalia Marino.

It's all in the name, a souffle for the lazy: Beat egg yolks with cheese over a simmering water bath, then mix in warm, whipped egg whites and bake it for breakfast, lunch or dinner. That's pretty much it. (If you're feeling a bit drunk with confidence after the soufflazy, and you want to make a more classic, time-consuming souffle, Melissa Clark has got you.) What else? Of course, I want to try those famous shortbread cookies, you know the ones, with the chocolate chips and the brown sugar and the flaky salt by Alison Roman. And I've been thinking a lot about Laurie Colwin's gingerbread, because, excuse me, gingerbread isn't just a December thing and I can eat it whenever I want. I'll put it on the table with a bowl of creme fraiche on Sunday, for those friends who text when they're in the neighborhood and drop by.

Speaking of cakes. Before I joined the Times, I'd never made the Marian Burros plum torte, and it felt like some kind of dark secret that I was carrying around. Last fall, I finally went for it, and now I make it all the time, even in the winter, when you can replace the fresh fruit with poached. My favorite version so far was filled with whole seckel pears cooked in saffron-cardamom syrup. I replaced half the flour with almond meal, took the sugar down by a third of a cup and didn't regret a thing.",Samin Nosrat has a fabulous new recipe for a soufflazy — a soufflé for the lazy — or take the time to bake.,17e7c3c8-7fca-587b-ba35-52f33ea2523f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/25/magazine/25mag-eat1-copy/25mag-eat1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=062853df7a7e56ef23537c01bc22001668fa76e81aede809347ce4c4c87326d4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Goat-cheese soufflazy.,17e7c3c8-7fca-587b-ba35-52f33ea2523f,N24News/imgs/17e7c3c8-7fca-587b-ba35-52f33ea2523f.jpg,17
Opinion,Republican Cynicism May Win Trump Re-election,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/opinion/trump-2020-debt.html,"It may have slipped by you, but last week Donald Trump suggested that he may be about to give U.S. farmers -- who have yet to see any benefits from his much-touted trade deal with China -- another round of government aid. This would be on top of the billions in farm aid that Trump has already delivered, costing taxpayers several times as much as Barack Obama's auto bailout -- a bailout Republicans fiercely denounced as ""welfare"" and ""crony capitalism"" at the time. If this sounds to you like a double standard -- Democratic bailouts bad, Republican bailouts good -- that's because it is. But it should be seen as part of a broader pattern of breathtaking fiscal hypocrisy, in which the G.O.P. went from insisting that federal debt posed an existential threat under Obama to complete indifference to budget deficits under Trump. This 180-degree turn is, as far as I can tell, the most cynical policy reversal of modern times. And this cynicism may win Trump the election. If Trump does win, there will be many recriminations among Democrats, especially about the vanity candidates who continue to fragment the field despite having no realistic chance of becoming the nominee. But while these recriminations will have much truth to them, the biggest factor working in Trump's favor is a strong economy -- not as strong as he claims, but good enough to provide a significant political lift (unless growth is derailed by the coronavirus).

Trump likes to bad-mouth the Obama economy. In reality, from 2010 onward, America experienced steady growth in both G.D.P. and employment -- and there was no upward break in the trend after 2016. But recovery from the 2007-9 recession could and should have been faster. What slowed recovery? Unprecedented fiscal austerity. In particular, government spending grew far more slowly during the Obama recovery than it did under either George W. Bush or Ronald Reagan. Does fiscal austerity hurt growth? Yes. We've seen this fact demonstrated again and again over the past decade, most recently in Japan, where an ill-advised effort by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to reduce the budget deficit sent the economy plunging at a 6 percent annual rate. And the austerity of the Obama years definitely slowed recovery; without those spending cuts, unemployment might well have fallen to 4 percent as early as 2014. So who was responsible for all this austerity? The answer, overwhelmingly, is Republicans in Congress. Remember, they threatened to create a financial crisis by refusing to raise the debt limit unless Obama cut spending.

Again, they insisted that austerity was essential because government debt was an enormous threat to America. But they lost all interest in deficits as soon as one of their own occupied the White House. Trump inherited a $600 billion deficit; he's blown that up to $1 trillion -- and hardly a single Republican in Congress has expressed dismay. How much have Trump's deficits boosted the economy? Well, they're poorly designed stimulus; the biggest item was tax cuts for corporations, which corporations used to buy back stock rather than to expand their businesses or raise wages. But while the Trump stimulus probably didn't deliver much bang per buck, it involved a heck of a lot of bucks. And Trump's economy also gets a lift from the fact that Republicans have ended the de facto economic sabotage that prevailed throughout the Obama years. Incidentally, the experience of the past three years also refutes two of the main arguments used to justify the disastrous turn to austerity after the financial crisis -- claims that deficits would hurt confidence and lead to a sharp rise in interest rates. None of this has happened. So how can Democrats run against Republican fiscal hypocrisy? Not by warning about the dangers of deficits -- that's both wrong on the substance and politically ineffective, because nobody cares. They might do better by pointing out that while Trump has rushed to cut taxes for corporations and the wealthy, he has been shortchanging the future. Ignoring his campaign promises, he has done nothing to raise much-needed spending on infrastructure. And despite its obvious indifference to budget deficits, his administration seems determined to deprive children of the adequate health care and nutrition they will need to become productive adults. And there's an important lesson for Democrats going beyond this election -- namely, how to deal with what I've called the Very Serious People, centrists who spent years insisting that government debt was the most important issue of our time (and also believing, or pretending to believe, that Republicans were sincere in their supposed concern about debt). The V.S.P.s have gone oddly silent under Trump -- funny how that works -- but they'll surely be back if Democrats retake the White House. But they have no idea what they're talking about, and never did. If and when they re-emerge, Democrats should ignore them. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Technology,Want to See What's Up Amazon's Sleeve? Take a Tour of Seattle,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/23/technology/amazon-seattle-testing.html,"Want to See What's Up Amazon's Sleeve? Take a Tour of Seattle

SEATTLE -- Tourists in Seattle have a new must-see destination: Amazon Go, the cashierless store the company opened near downtown in January. People who are interested in what is coming next from Amazon, which makes about half of all online retail sales, just need to roam the city. Amazon uses Seattle as a living laboratory, trying out new retail and logistics models . Some trials never leave the city. But others, like the use of independent contractors to deliver packages, have found their ways to the rest of the country and abroad. The pilots point to a company, with ambitions that at times can seem boundless, investing deeply in figuring out its physical footprint and how to provide convenience at a lower cost. ""Seattle is great for rolling out tests that haven't been completely debugged,"" said Jeff Shulman, a business professor at the University of Washington who hosts a podcast on the city's culture. In 2015 when Amazon first tested the Treasure Truck, a decorated vehicle that drives around and sells a daily deal like smart watches or plant-based burger patties, it delayed the public debut at least twice before finally going live. The service has since expanded to more than two dozen cities.

As the grunge era in music showed more than two decades ago , ""experimentation is embedded in Seattle's DNA,"" Professor Shulman said, so ""you can get early feedback on how people use your product, and they will also be fairly forgiving on the hiccups."" Amazon said it employed more than 45,000 people in the city, and its teams turn to them to test new products and services. Here's a tour of a few places where Amazon toys with new ideas in its backyard. Even after projects have expanded outside the city, the flagship locations remain a home for tweaks. Amazon Go: Two Locations , Two Formats

Starting a technology-heavy experiment like Amazon Go in Seattle makes sense because the culture prizes the avant-garde, Professor Shulman said. But success here can give a false sense of optimism that a product might take off, so Amazon pilots some experiments elsewhere. Prime Now, the company's one-hour delivery service, for example, started in New York. ""You will see them go to other cities when looking to test if the market will like it,"" and whether it's worth expanding around the globe, Professor Shulman said. Amazon has big plans for building more Go stores. It opened a third in Seattle, as well as its first in Chicago this month, and has acknowledged plans to expand in New York and San Francisco.

In the front of the store, Amazon customers can pick up and return packages. In the back, workers sort boxes for delivery drivers. Amazon has other pickup locations around the country, usually near college campuses, but most don't have the integration with a sorting depot. Customers go in, scan a code and then wait for the door on an Amazon locker to quietly pop open and reveal their package, like an automated post office box. The back of the locker is open, providing a glimpse into a small sorting facility used by Amazon Flex, the program piloted in Seattle that pays independent contractors to make deliveries in their own cars.

The storefront offers an alternative to customers who don't want boxes dropped on their doorstep, be it for fear of porch thieves or rain. But it also tests what makes people choose an option that costs Amazon less than having drivers handle the last mile of delivery. Offering reliable, fast delivery has been essential for Amazon's growth, but that door-to-door delivery is also expensive. Shipping costs ate up 22 percent of Amazon's online sales in the second quarter, up from 16.5 percent two years earlier. The pickup storefront also provides one more place for Amazon to put ads in front of consumers, a growing business for the company. Last week, signs for Red Bull were displayed on a TV screen and a poster by the front desk.

For more than a decade, Amazon tried to break into the grocery business, a mecca for recurring consumer spending also known for brutal profit margins. It started AmazonFresh grocery delivery in Seattle in 2007 and worked out kinks for five years before expanding to other markets. But home delivery of perishable goods is tricky and expensive. In Ballard, a neighborhood on the north side , is another experiment: one of two Seattle locations that Amazon opened for customers to pick up groceries ordered online. It feels like pulling into a Sonic Drive-In. After a customer parks under an awning, cameras read the license plate, and an Amazon employee brings out the groceries and puts them in the customer's trunk.

While Amazon has since opened bookstores in at least a dozen other states, the original remains a test site. The Seattle location was one of two sites where Amazon first tried letting customers return items. On a recent afternoon, more people appeared to be returning items than buying books or devices. Now, all Amazon bookstores accept some returns. It's part of the company's growing network of return options that don't depend on the mail. For some customers, going to a store is easier than finding a box and packing tape to ship something back, and for Amazon, it's most likely far cheaper. Drop-off returns cost retailers about 20 to 30 percent less than returns by mail, said Mark Geller, the chief executive of Happy Returns, which runs drop-off locations for other online retailers. ""A big part of the costs is first-mile, last-mile stuff,"" Mr. Geller said. ""It's the law of nature that over time people will take the path of least resistance. If they reduce the friction by making more drop-off locations, and in more kinds of places, that is going to become compelling.""","The e-commerce giant uses its headquarters city as a living laboratory, trying out new retail and logistics models.",49baef2d-8b08-535a-ab01-3984a31adbc8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/21/merlin_144077052_67addfcd-8b6b-4ec9-9800-5beb46aae02c/merlin_144077052_67addfcd-8b6b-4ec9-9800-5beb46aae02c-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=a7eda7f235773a95b2bfbf725b43c02e42a68482b4ccfa926cb1ff58dd97e191&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An Amazon Treasure Truck drives around Seattle selling daily deals.

Health,Airborne Coronavirus: What You Should Do Now,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/06/health/coronavirus-airborne-aerosols.html,"It means it affects every organ in the body that has lots of fine blood vessels in it, and not even just organs. I mean, so it affects the lungs, which are the filter where the air gets into the blood, and you have lots of little fine blood vessels surrounding the little sacs at the ends of your breathing tubes. It attacks the kidneys, because that's the filter where the urine comes out of the blood. So you have very fine networks of blood vessels there. It attacks the gut, because you have a network of blood vessels in your gut where food gets into your body. It attacks the brain, because you have lots of fine blood vessels in the brain. It doesn't attack the nerve cells in the brain, which most of the brain is made of. It doesn't attack the muscle cells in the heart. But it attacks the blood vessels that go through all those other parts. And so when they do autopsies they find thousands of tiny little blood clots all over the body. We have lots of people who have strokes. And as those blood clots clot up blood vessels to small areas of the brain, you may get dementia or disorientation. And then in kids, when you have 'Covid toes' in teenagers and young adults, this is the little capillaries in the hands and feet getting blocked, and getting this inflamed, painful, red or purple toe and finger syndrome. So it's more complicated to deal with a disease that can travel to any organ in the body.

Well, viruses, over the course of infecting lots of hosts, tend to become less lethal to those hosts and more transmissible. Like, for example, if I have the virus and it mutates inside me, and it turns into a more deadly strain, I've now got two strains. And I pass on that virus to two people, the person who gets the more deadly strain is more likely to go home, go to bed and die. Whereas the person who gets the less lethal, more transmissible strain is going to go out to a disco and infect 40 people. And if you do that enough times in the course of the virus, the virus always sort of naturally moves in the direction of the more transmissible, less lethal one, because that's the one that spreads whenever it's given that kind of fork in the road. And so this is what happened in 1918. The virus started off extremely deadly. It blew through an enormous chunk of the population, probably 60 to 70 percent of all the people in the world. And then it disappeared for a while. Then it turned up in pigs, and it was a pig virus for a while. And then when enough humans who'd never had the virus were born, it reappeared in people. But it reappeared as the H1N1 seasonal flu, the one that we know about as one of the seasonal flus every year. But that became less lethal and more transmissible. And basically all viruses do that. And we might be beginning to see the very first hints of that happening with this virus.

Well, there's always a little bit of wind outside. Humidity also makes droplets fall out of the air. But mostly it's the wind. And when people talk within a few feet of each other, especially when they talk loud, or when they laugh, or when they sing or shout or do anything like that, you put out this kind of invisible mist of little tiny droplets that spews out of your mouth and sort of hangs around your head. But it also drifts towards the other person. And so you're sitting inside each other's droplet cloud. And those little tiny droplets, even if you're not feeling the other person in effect spitting on your face, that droplet cloud can hold enough virus to transmit the disease from one person to the other. And indoors when there's no windows open, it can sort of drift through the room, more or less at head level, and go past one person after another at a cocktail party or inside a bar like that. And each person inhaling a little bit of that droplet cloud, until the disease has spread to 20, 30, 40 people. Whereas outdoors, the breeze just blows that away. So standing six feet away outdoors, even without masks, is considered safe.

Yes. I mean, we've seen transmission of virus to large numbers of people in funerals, in choir practices, at birthday parties, inside bars, in business meetings. Virtually any kind of indoor environment you can imagine, there have been super spreader events. There may be ways to eventually make indoor spaces safer. There's going to be no way to make them completely safe. And all this talk about what's safe to do indoors brings us to really the most important question, which is the most important indoor space we want to get functioning again, which is schools. Can kids go to school safely? And again, the science isn't firm yet. But there are more and more hints that it may be safe, or pretty safe, to open the schools in the fall, especially for very young kids. There's growing evidence that kids are not big transmitters of the virus to adults. Denmark opened its schools in April. Did not see a big spike up in cases. Finland opened its schools in May. Did not see a big spike up in cases. Even from the beginning in China, the Chinese said, every time they looked at clusters in families, almost never did they see a case where the child, particularly the youngest child, was the one who introduced the virus into the family. Usually it was parent infecting the kids, not the other way around. We know that kids are big transmitters of flu viruses. And they do it because they cough and sneeze like crazy. But if the biggest symptom that they're getting is inflammation, rather than coughing and sneezing, -- and that's the case; kids tend to get more sort of cranky, inflammatory, unpleasant manifestations of the disease, rather than something that looks like a cold. Then it would make sense that that might be a reason why they're not big transmitters.

Yeah. We have to realize we are just in the opening phases of this pandemic. I mean, this is the second inning. And there's still -- there's more than 120,000 people dead. So we are doing the dance in, dance out of various forms of lockdown. But we need to get to the point where we're all basically dancing to the same music. Where all governors accept the notion that when they have a problem that's getting out of control in their state, they react quickly. And if they do that, they will save lives of their own citizens. And I think we're beginning to see that. In places like Texas, places like Arizona, places like Florida the governors have made major about-faces in the last couple of weeks. And they're getting the science that the thing you do today doesn't produce good effects until a month from today, because the people who got infected yesterday are the ones who are going to be in your hospital three weeks from now. So they're beginning to catch on. But we need to arrive at sort of a common understanding that we don't all have to move in lockstep as a nation, but at the crucial moments we need to take similar steps to save lives.","How to protect yourself from a virus that may be floating indoors?

Music,Lou Reed Archive Opens at New York Public Library,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/arts/music/lou-reed-archive-new-york-public-library.html,"After two years of cataloging and preparing, the Lou Reed Archive at the New York Public Library's performing arts branch at Lincoln Center opens to the public on Friday. And to celebrate, the library is issuing 6,000 limited-edition library cards featuring an image of Reed taken by Mick Rock in 1972.

The library acquired the archive -- a large collection of notes, photographs, and more than 600 hours of recordings -- after the rocker's wife, Laurie Anderson, decided to share it with an institution that could preserve and showcase it.

Before Reed died in 2013, he had never discussed what to do with his belongings, Anderson said in a phone interview.","To celebrate the opening, the library has issued limited-edition library cards featuring an image of the rocker.",ac333635-aaa1-5930-80fb-36b66d28e890,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/15/arts/15lou-reed-item/15lou-reed-item-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=36fc3003eda586d93ec7e7fe89d1560b4bcfef41ccb6740f592bbde5d8e2f29e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The New York Public Library is issuing 6,000 limited-edition library cards to celebrate the opening of the Lou Reed Archive.",ac333635-aaa1-5930-80fb-36b66d28e890,N24News/imgs/ac333635-aaa1-5930-80fb-36b66d28e890.jpg,12

Stationed off the coast of Britain, island wardens manage the preservation of their small speck of land -- while coping with extreme weather and limited access to the mainland.

A Glance at Daily Life Among the Caretakers of Britain's Small Islands

Bardsey Island, as seen from the warden's house. In the distance is the island's lighthouse, built in 1821.

At the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, with travel restrictions in place worldwide, we launched a new series -- The World Through a Lens -- in which photojournalists help transport you, virtually, to some of our planet's most beautiful and intriguing places. This week, Alex Ingram shares a collection of images from small British islands. The waters surrounding Britain are speckled with thousands of small islands, only a small fraction of which are inhabited, some by as few as one or two people. Among those who call Britain's small islands home are a collection of wardens -- caretakers who spend their lives in quiet solitude, away from the crowded corners of our urban world. Often employed by nonprofit conservation groups, their role is to maintain and manage the preservation of their small speck of land -- its natural beauty, its wildlife -- for future generations, often while conducting research into delicate ecosystems.

Wardens have limited access to the mainland during the winter months, aren't guaranteed fresh running water, and often live under the threat of harsh storms and perilous currents that can leave them marooned for weeks at a time. Food is delivered once a month by boat. It's not a role that many are suited for. And yet a growing number of people are dreaming of this simple way of life, seeking to trade the madness of our busy cities for a self-sufficient life among nature.

Over the past three years I've been visiting some of these remote islands, spending at least a week on each and experiencing firsthand what life is like there. Growing up in the tiny Welsh city of St. Davids, in Pembrokeshire, I heard countless tales about one island in particular: Skomer, a tiny jewel in the Irish Sea, filled with history and wildlife, including many thousands of puffins. Later, when I'd moved to London, I heard stories about Ed Stubbings and Bee Buche, the two wardens who lived on the island year-round, and I couldn't stop thinking about how different their life must be compared to mine.

Within 30 minutes of arriving on Skomer, I was strapped into a harness and was following Ed and Bee across the island. We abseiled down a 60-foot cliff onto the rocky bay below in order to monitor seal pups. I fell in love with the way of life on the island -- the people, the landscapes, the pace. A few months later, I arranged a helicopter flight across the 12-mile stretch of water to Lundy, an island in the Bristol Channel. Soon I was hopping all around Britain -- to Bardsey, Skokholm, Flat Holm, Ramsey.

When I began visiting these places, I held the misconception that island living would be desolate and lonely, and that the people would prove to be introverted nomads, having run to the hills to flee human contact. But the more time I've spent on these islands, the more I've come to realize how misguided my assumptions were. What I found instead were small communities of people who established a deep sense of connection with one another, who worked hard and felt passionate about conservation, and who were consistently warm and welcoming to visitors.

In many ways, life as a British island warden has become less isolating in recent years. Warden stations have electricity and internet access, and all of the wardens I met carried cellphones. During the warmer months, many of the islands are visited regularly by tourists -- hikers, bird-watchers, ecologists -- from the mainland. But come October, the boats stop and the islands' wardens are left on their own. The job requires a great deal of resourcefulness -- and diplomacy. (When you can't avoid your neighbors, petty disputes quickly become untenable.)

Ed and Bee have since left Skomer and migrated farther north, to the Scottish island of Islay, where they're currently doing wildlife conservation work. Sian Stacey, the warden of Bardsey Island, moved back to the mainland in order to start a family -- though she dreams of one day returning to island life. It's a dream I've come to know myself. The pull of these places can be hard to resist. Alex Ingram is a photojournalist based in London.

Education,"The Hackathon Fast Track, From Campus to Silicon Valley",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/12/education/edlife/the-hackathon-fast-track-from-campus-to-silicon-valley.html,"Some say the experience is akin to that of a nascent start-up, and an ideal way to test-drive the experience.

Zach Latta and Benjamin Zweig, both 17, high-fiving over the completion of a task. At 16, Zach started HackEdu, a nonprofit that works with high school students to start programming clubs. At least 26 coders at TreeHacks this year were attending high school. These younger participants are often spinning off their projects into start-ups and moneymaking apps.

Dan Isaza, a Stanford junior majoring in mathematical and computational science, also happens to be a co-founder of NeoReach, a platform that enables marketers to launch and track advertising programs.

Collegiate hackathons have emerged as important places for networking, job recruiting, entrepreneurial pitching and learning. Fostering an education-first ethos, they encourage students to tinker with new software and hardware. There is an expert in nearly anything at hackathons, and students teach one another.

Collegiate hackathons are increasingly popular. Last year, there were approximately 40. This year, at least 150 are expected to be scheduled. For TreeHacks, 672 participated, with more than 250 from about 60 universities. Some came from as far away as Taiwan and the United Kingdom.

At collegiate hackathons, students program mobile apps, websites or hardware, including aerial drones and virtual reality headsets. This semester they converged on Stanford's alumni center for TreeHacks, a 36-hour competition (named for the band's fir-shaped mascot). Among prizes: a seat on a zero-gravity airplane and, of course, glory.

Shariq Hashme squints at his laptop screen as he scrolls through hundreds of lines of computer code. ""I can't even make sense of it right now,"" he says with a grimace. The long string of numbers, symbols and letters would usually be intelligible to Mr. Hashme, a 21-year-old computer science major at the University of Maryland, College Park, but at this moment, he's having trouble even keeping his eyes open. In the last 27 hours, he has slept just two. It's 2:37 a.m. on a Sunday, and he is toiling alongside 671 young software engineers who are camped out in and around a 6,000-square-foot ballroom in Stanford's alumni center. The space resembles an oversize dorm room during final exams: Temporary workstations are cluttered with computers, electronics cables, half-eaten doughnuts and empty cans of Red Bull. As hundreds of students type feverishly at their laptops, dozens more are passed out in sleeping bags. Meanwhile, an overhead sound system blasts bass-heavy songs -- think Kanye West. ""What's really cool about this atmosphere is that it's pretty easy to say 'Screw it' when it comes to schoolwork,"" says Vikram Rajagopalan, a sophomore from the University of Michigan. ""Pulling out a textbook is very frowned upon."" None of these sleep-deprived students is cramming for midterms or racing to finish a class assignment. They're participating in TreeHacks, a 36-hour contest to program mobile apps, websites or hardware, including aerial drones and virtual reality headsets. The goal of a hackathon, a portmanteau of marathon and hacking, isn't to obtain confidential data the way hackers infiltrated Sony Pictures last year. Instead, teams attempt to build a new piece of tech, either of their choosing or with code provided by one of the sponsors. At the end, the judges walk from table to table as the programmers show off their projects, just like a school science fair.

During the opening ceremony for TreeHacks (named for the fir-shaped mascot), a DirecTV representative grabbed a microphone and announced: ""We want you to build the future of television!"" On the same stage, two reps from Microsoft encouraged students to build projects using its motion-sensing Kinect and shot T-shirts into the crowd using a cannon controlled by the device. Mr. Hashme's team spent the weekend programming four Kinects with an Oculus Rift virtual reality headset to create an immersive 3-D videoconferencing system. Hackathons have become commonplace among professional developers, especially in booming tech centers like San Francisco and New York, and have emerged as prime places for networking, job recruiting, entrepreneurial pitching and, in many cases, winning cash. (One sponsored by the tech company Salesforce famously offered a $1 million prize to the most innovative project.) Now weekend hackathons organized by and for students are surging in size, scale and frequency. ""A few years ago, hackathons weren't really that popular -- it was sort of a subculture,"" says Kathryn Siegel, a junior at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""There's been an enormous explosion."" Last year there were some 40 intercollegiate hackathons. This year more than 150 are expected, according to Jon Gottfried, a founder of Major League Hacking. The company, often called the N.C.A.A. of college hackathons, provides guidelines and resources for student organizers and ranks colleges based on their students' overall performance during fall and spring. Last fall, the top school was the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. The longest-running collegiate hackathon, founded at the University of Pennsylvania in 2009, has since ballooned to accommodate 1,200 students each semester. Demand, though, is far outpacing growth. At TreeHacks, 2,500 applied for 500 spots. (Capacity was later expanded to 672, which required setting up a heated outdoor tent.) More than 250 participants traveled to Palo Alto, Calif., from some 60 universities, including five Ivy League schools, top-tier engineering programs like Carnegie Mellon, M.I.T. and Georgia Tech, and universities as far away as the United Kingdom and Taiwan.

""It's a big party,"" says Mr. Rajagopalan, who directs the University of Michigan hackathon. ""At MHacks, we had therapy dogs come just so people could pet puppies."" Social activities offer only a brief reprieve from the stress. Aside from having to debug their computer code at the last minute, Mr. Hashme's teammates struggled for hours with basic carpentry. They needed to construct a four-foot-tall frame for holding the Kinect cameras. They took an Uber car to Home Depot to buy two-by-fours and supplies but, curiously, the software engineers did not return with a hammer and nails. They tried joining the boards with Elmer's wood glue, which failed to dry, so in a last-ditch effort they frantically wrapped electrical tape all around their rickety wooden frame. They didn't win. Top honors went to programmers from Purdue and the University of Waterloo who developed a robotic arm controlled by motion sensor. The engineers won a free trip on a zero-gravity airplane (one ticket: about $5,000) as well as travel expenses and admission to hackathons in Taiwan and South Korea. Other prizes: a 50-inch flat-screen television, airfare to Hawaii and a trip to Paris. Hackathon-goers maintain that what motivates them is not the awards. Mr. Hashme, who directs the University of Maryland's Bitcamp, has participated in more than 40 hackathons since 2013. He says he attends because they force him to learn new tech skills. ""Sitting in your dorm alone and trying to work on something, you wind up doing things you regret later, like watching a movie or browsing the Internet,"" he says. At hackathons he enjoys meeting like-minded students from across the country -- ""It's a room full of doers."" Fostering an education-first ethos, collegiate hackathons encourage students to tinker with new software and hardware and challenge themselves, and students teach one another. ""There's an expert on nearly anything there,"" says Dave Fontenot, a former director of MHacks. ""If you ask who the best JavaScript person is, pretty soon you're meeting a GitHub celebrity."" (GitHub, a user-generated online repository for sharing computer code, is like a Wikipedia for software.) At TreeHacks, a team of Apple engineers was on hand to mentor students at all hours of the night.

Many attendees say they acquire practical skills that college courses fail to teach, and gain technical proficiency at a much faster pace. ""Hackathons are like gyms,"" Mr. Fontenot says. ""If you never go to the gym, you're never going to get big."" These days, it pays to develop big muscles. In one iconic scene in the Oscar-winning film ""The Social Network,"" Mark Zuckerberg hosts a hackathon among five students in his Harvard dorm room. The winner earns an internship at his start-up, Facebook. Collegiate hackathons have replicated that scene on a far grander scale. Identifying talented coders who can dream big and thrive under pressure is particularly valuable to Silicon Valley. Since hackathons showcase some of the best, brightest and most motivated upstart programmers, the events have become a focal point for recruiting. Some say hackathons are as fruitful as job fairs. ""We want to find the next Mark Zuckerberg and the next Jack Dorsey,"" says Andy Chen, a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, the venture capital firm that invested in Uber, Google, Snapchat and Twitter, which Mr. Dorsey helped found. The firm sends representatives to at least 20 collegiate competitions each year. Shariq Hashme, a senior at the University of Maryland, paused from his task: the creation of an immersive 3-D videoconferencing system. Peter DaSilva for The New York Times ""I strongly believe that the best talent are at these opt-in courses called hackathons,"" Mr. Chen says, adding that they are essential for any student pursuing a career in tech. ""If you're not at a hackathon, you're at a disadvantage. What you learn in class isn't necessarily as applicable to the work force.""

Seeing which students can thrive in a chaotic environment akin to nascent start-ups is a boon to recruiters. Likewise, students say hackathons are an ideal way to test-drive the experience of working at a start-up before committing to a job. But finding talent is only part of the appeal for venture capitalists. Brian Pokorny, a partner at SV Angel, which invested in Foursquare, Zappos and Airbnb, says the events help them spot emerging tech developments. Specifically, he points to the recent rise in the number of virtual reality projects from just a few years ago, when more students were building social media apps in the vein of Instagram or WhatsApp. ""The students,"" Mr. Pokorny says, ""are almost like crystal balls for the future."" At last January's HackTech, hosted by the University of California, Los Angeles, and the California Institute of Technology, a 17-year-old named Ash Bhat proudly announced via Twitter that his hackathon project would top Snapchat, the messaging app. Snapchat had just released a new API, the back-end protocols and code that allow developers to build other software applications. Mr. Bhat realized he could ""break the Captcha."" "".@snapchat is outdated, we're going to show that it's flawed and are going to release a competitor. all in 36 hours,"" tweeted Mr. Bhat at 2:53 a.m. He and three others proceeded to code a workaround for sending messages to all of Snapchat's 4.6 million users (this is not a feature Snapchat permits). Less than 12 hours later, to Mr. Bhat's amazement, Snapchat's chief executive, Evan Spiegel, 24, was standing in front of him at the hackathon, which was held in Santa Monica, not far from Snapchat's offices in Venice. Mr. Spiegel asked to see the hack and Mr. Bhat obliged. ""It was a little tense,"" Mr. Bhat confesses now. ""We thought they were going to take legal action."" (They didn't.) The day after the impromptu meeting, Mr. Bhat had dinner with the three founders of Tinder, the popular dating app. They gave him their recruiting spiel, he says.

""A lot of my friends are dropping out just to pursue their own ideas, and recruiting friends to drop out to pursue those ideas,"" says Evadora de Zhengia, a sophomore at the University of California, Berkeley, who is a director of Cal Hacks. ""I can name off the top of my head at least 10 dropouts. There's a lot more incentive to take a break from school for a semester and see where it takes them."" The Thiel Fellowship -- $100,000 awarded by the tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel to students who forgo college to pursue their own start-ups -- frequently sends reps to hackathons to pass out pamphlets and buttons with the Thiel logo. ""We're not there to snipe people out of school,"" says Danielle Strachmann, program director of the fellowship, adding that she lets students lead the discussion. ""We're willing to have these hard conversations with them about what they're looking to do and what we can do to help them. Having a degree used to be your ticket to a job, but now maybe it's just going to a hackathon."" Some participants are not even enrolled in college. At least 26 coders at TreeHacks attend high school. Last year at HackTech, 20 percent of the programmers were high school students. These younger participants are not just crashing collegiate hackathons; some are spinning off their projects into start-ups and moneymaking apps.

""The hackathon is sort of the beginning,"" says Veeral Patel, 17, who helped build a best-selling iPhone app called Workflow at MHacks last year. Workflow won the $5,000 prize -- at the time, three of its four engineers were still in high school, including Mr. Patel. Three months later, two of Workflow's developers -- Ari Weinstein, then an M.I.T. freshman, and Conrad Kramer, then a high school senior admitted to M.I.T. -- were both accepted into the Thiel Fellowship, which allowed them to continue developing their team's project. ""I'm kind of bummed 'cause I couldn't work on it as much as I wanted because of homework and college applications,"" says Mr. Patel, who has been admitted to Stanford, which gives students the option to defer. Some universities cater to the kinds of students who participate in hackathons, either by allowing a gap year or providing opportunities for less structured learning and coding. ""Students need this kind of space all the time, not just at hackathons,"" says Stacey Sickels Locke, senior director of development at the University of Maryland, which is building a lab for engineering students to experiment with virtual reality hardware and software. The initiative is a result of a $31 million donation by Brendan Iribe, chief executive of Oculus VR, the virtual reality start-up acquired by Facebook last year for $2 billion. Mr. Iribe, who dropped out of Maryland during his freshman year, decided to make his donation, the largest in the university's history, after attending its hackathon. He was depressed by the computer science facilities but impressed by the Bitcamp energy. Mr. Iribe has said he believes students should finish college, not follow in his footsteps. Whatever path they choose, one thing is certain: Hackathons are instilling in young engineers a sense of life after school, and the feeling that they can accomplish anything.

Economy,State and Local Tax Deduction: An Item Blurring Party Lines,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/business/economy/state-local-income-tax-deduction.html,"To some, it is a tax on blue-state liberalism. To others, President Trump's plan to end the federal deduction for state and local taxes would eliminate a costly perk for the wealthy. But to many taxpayers, the deduction is a cherished break that can save them thousands of dollars in double taxation. Mr. Trump and House Republicans, riding a wave of conservative and populist sentiment, are pushing to end the provision. Yet they must overcome a long tradition and powerful opponents, including Republican and Democratic officials in wealthy, populous states like California, New Jersey, New York and Texas. ""I don't think they're going to seriously restrict it at all,"" said William G. Gale, a co-director of the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and a former economic adviser to President George Bush.

Congressional Republicans have indicated that they will go it alone on tax legislation, but taking on such an entrenched interest usually requires bipartisan support. ""If Republicans do it by themselves, they put a big target on their backs,"" Mr. Gale said. Members of Congress generally take a ""political Hippocratic oath"" to ""never be seen to do obvious harm,"" he said, but eliminating the deduction, which would increase taxes and undermine the ability of cities and states to raise revenue, would violate that precept. A raft of organizations that represent state and local governments -- including the National Governors Association, the United States Conference of Mayors and the National Conference of State Legislatures -- denounced the measure, saying it would upset the balance between local and federal interests and undermine growth. ""We fundamentally believe that Americans' income, property and purchases should not be taxed twice,"" the organizations said in a statement. Other interest groups have also registered their opposition, like the National Association of Realtors, which said that eliminating the state and local deduction would help ""nullify the current tax benefits of owning a home for the vast majority of tax filers."" The idea of preventing the federal government from taxing money that citizens must pay to state and local tax collectors goes back to the Civil War, and the deduction was included in the first income tax legislation. One fear, articulated by Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist Papers, was that the federal government might try to monopolize taxation ""to the entire exclusion and destruction of state governments.""

Striking a blow at the taxing power of cities and states has long appealed to conservative Republicans. They argue that the deduction works like a subsidy and encourages states -- particularly those dominated by Democrats -- to set higher rates and spend more taxpayer money.
* Retail earnings and Black Friday: the week in business.
* Elizabeth Holmes will resume her testimony in her fraud trial. The deduction is also one of the code's most costly items. A 2016 report from the Tax Policy Center said ending of the deduction would save the federal government $1.3 trillion over 10 years. That pot of money is particularly tempting because most of the other big-ticket items in the tax code -- including the deduction for mortgage interest and charitable donations -- have been labeled off limits by the White House and House Republicans. The total cost of the president's tax-related wish list is still a mystery, given the scarcity of detail, but deep cuts in corporate and individual taxes certainly would leave a gaping budget deficit that could run into the trillions. Like most other deductions, the state and local tax provision primarily benefits wealthier taxpayers who itemize deductions. The Tax Policy Center's report finds that households with annual incomes exceeding $100,000 would bear roughly 90 percent of the increase; those with incomes over $500,000 would absorb 40 percent. More precise calculations are impossible because other proposals -- like eliminating the alternative minimum tax -- would create savings for some of these taxpayers. For example, roughly 30 percent of taxpayers itemize deductions, but that number would certainly fall if the standard deduction were increased, as Mr. Trump proposed, or if various breaks were erased. While the upper middle class would feel the biggest hit, the wealthiest would mostly be unaffected because of limits on the value of deductions, said Edward D. Kleinbard, a professor of tax law at the University of Southern California. ""People affected are those with six-figure incomes, not seven-figure incomes,"" he said.

What is clear is that residents in states that impose the highest combination of property taxes and individual and corporate income taxes would pay the most. Taxpayers in 10 states -- California, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia -- claim more than half of the total amount deducted, according to the Tax Policy Center. (Even in states without income taxes, including Nevada and Washington, some residents benefit because they can deduct sales taxes instead, the center said.) The Partnership for New York City, a group of large employers, estimated that the value to New York City taxpayers of itemized deductions for state and local taxes was $7.7 billion in 2014, or $6,600 per affected taxpayer. For those earning more than $200,000, the average deduction for state and local taxes exceeded $30,000. Pressure to cut local taxes is likely to mean less spending on programs and services. Conservatives have complained that the deduction causes low-tax, often poorer, states to subsidize high-tax areas. But as Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the partnership, pointed out, even with those deductions, New York City still sent far more money to the federal government than it received back. City residents paid $96 billion in personal income taxes, and businesses paid $19 billion. In return, the city received about $61 billion from Washington. In any case, she said, ending the state and local deduction would hurt states like New York most. ""You can say for sure,"" Ms. Wylde added, ""that high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut will not get as much benefit as states like Florida,"" where taxes are significantly lower.","White House and congressional proposals would eliminate the provision, challenging tradition and bipartisan defenders in wealthy and populous states.",7e50fbb0-6a2c-59df-b240-497763cd28b2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/28/us/28deduct/28deduct-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=61dc07541a274eaf877c9d1aee03e3d002350366ebed42497ed7fdd16a7f6dd3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The value to New York City taxpayers of itemized deductions for state and local taxes was $7.7 billion in 2014, or about $6,600 per affected taxpayer, according to estimates from the Partnership for New York, an association of large employers.",7e50fbb0-6a2c-59df-b240-497763cd28b2,N24News/imgs/7e50fbb0-6a2c-59df-b240-497763cd28b2.jpg,8
Education,Colleges Adapt Online Courses to Ease Burden,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/30/education/colleges-adapt-online-courses-to-ease-burden.html,"SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Dazzled by the potential of free online college classes, educators are now turning to the gritty task of harnessing online materials to meet the toughest challenges in American higher education: giving more students access to college, and helping them graduate on time. Nearly half of all undergraduates in the United States arrive on campus needing remedial work before they can begin regular credit-bearing classes. That early detour can be costly, leading many to drop out, often in heavy debt and with diminished prospects of finding a job. Meanwhile, shrinking state budgets have taken a heavy toll at public institutions, reducing the number of seats available in classes students must take to graduate. In California alone, higher education cuts have left hundreds of thousands of college students without access to classes they need. To address both problems and keep students on track to graduation, universities are beginning to experiment with adding the new ""massive open online courses,"" created to deliver elite college instruction to anyone with an Internet connection, to their offerings.

While the courses, known as MOOCs, have enrolled millions of students around the world, most who enroll never start a single assignment, and very few complete the courses. So to reach students who are not ready for college-level work, or struggling with introductory courses, universities are beginning to add extra supports to the online materials, in hopes of improving success rates. Here at San Jose State, for example, two pilot programs weave material from the online classes into the instructional mix and allow students to earn credit for them. ""We're in Silicon Valley, we breathe that entrepreneurial air, so it makes sense that we are the first university to try this,"" said Mohammad Qayoumi, the university's president. ""In academia, people are scared to fail, but we know that innovation always comes with the possibility of failure. And if it doesn't work the first time, we'll figure out what went wrong and do better."" In one pilot program, the university is working with Udacity, a company co-founded by a Stanford professor, to see whether round-the-clock online mentors, hired and trained by the company, can help more students make their way through three fully online basic math courses. The tiny for-credit pilot courses, open to both San Jose State students and local high school and community college students, began in January, so it is too early to draw any conclusions. But early signs are promising, so this summer, Udacity and San Jose State are expanding those classes to 1,000 students, and adding new courses in psychology and computer programming, with tuition of only $150 a course.

San Jose State has already achieved remarkable results with online materials from edX, a nonprofit online provider, in its circuits course, a longstanding hurdle for would-be engineers. Usually, two of every five students earn a grade below C and must retake the course or change career plans. So last spring, Ellen Junn, the provost, visited Anant Agarwal, an M.I.T. professor who taught a free online version of the circuits class, to ask whether San Jose State could become a living lab for his course, the first offering from edX, an online collaboration of Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Dr. Junn hoped that blending M.I.T.'s online materials with live classroom sessions might help more students succeed. Dr. Agarwal, the president of edX, agreed enthusiastically, and without any formal agreement or exchange of money, he arranged for San Jose State to offer the blended class last fall. The results were striking: 91 percent of those in the blended section passed, compared with 59 percent in the traditional class. ""We're engineers, and we check our results, but if this semester is similar, we will not have the traditional version next year,"" said Khosrow Ghadiri, who teaches the blended class. ""It would be educational malpractice."" It is hard to say, though, how much the improved results come from the edX online materials, and how much from the shift to classroom sessions focusing on small group projects, rather than lectures. Finding better ways to move students through the start of college is crucial, said Josh Jarrett, a higher education officer at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which in the past year has given grants to develop massive open online courses for basic and remedial courses. ""For us, 2012 was all about trying to tilt some of the MOOC attention toward the more novice learner, the low-income and first-generation students,"" he said. ""And 2013 is about blending MOOCs into college courses where there is additional support, and students can get credit. While some low-income young adults can benefit from what I call the free-range MOOCs, the research suggests that most are going to need more scaffolding, more support.""

Online courses are undeniably chipping at the traditional boundaries of higher education. Until now, most of the millions of students who register for them could not earn credit for their work. But that is changing, and not just at San Jose State. The three leading providers, Udacity, EdX and Coursera, are all offering proctored exams, and in some cases, certification for transfer credit through the American Council on Education. Last month, in a controversial proposal, the president pro tem of the California Senate announced the introduction of legislation allowing students in the state's public colleges and universities who cannot get a seat in oversubscribed lower-level classes to earn credit for faculty-approved online versions, including those from private vendors like edX and Udacity. And on Wednesday, San Jose State announced that next fall, it will pay a licensing fee to offer three to five more blended edX courses, probably including Harvard's ""Ancient Greek Heroes"" and Berkeley's""Artificial Intelligence."" And over the summer, it will train 11 other California State campuses to use the blended M.I.T. circuits course. Dr. Qayoumi favors the blended model for upper-level courses, but fully online courses like Udacity's for lower-level classes, which could be expanded to serve many more students at low cost. Traditional teaching will be disappearing in five to seven years, he predicts, as more professors come to realize that lectures are not the best route to student engagement, and cash-strapped universities continue to seek cheaper instruction.

""There may still be face-to-face classes, but they would not be in lecture halls,"" he said. ""And they will have not only course material developed by the instructor, but MOOC materials and labs, and content from public broadcasting or corporate sources. But just as faculty currently decide what textbook to use, they will still have the autonomy to choose what materials to include."" While San Jose State professors decided what material should be covered in the three Udacity math courses, it was Udacity employees who determined the course look and flow -- and, in most cases, appeared on camera. ""We gave them lecture notes and a textbook, and they 'Udacified' things, and wrote the script, which we edited,"" said Susan McClory, San Jose State's developmental math coordinator. ""We made sure they used our way of finding a common denominator."" The online mentors work in shifts at Udacity's offices in nearby Mountain View, Calif., waiting at their laptops for the ""bing"" that signals a question, and answering immediately. ""We get to hear the 'aha' moments, and these all-caps messages 'THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU,' "" said Rachel Meltzer, a former clinical research manager at Stanford and mentor who is starting medical school next fall. The mentors answer about 30 questions a day, like how to type the infinity symbol or add unlike fractions -- or, occasionally, whether Ms. Meltzer is interested in a date. The questions appear in a chat box on-screen, but tutoring can move to a whiteboard, or even a live conversation. When many students share confusion, mentors provide feedback to the instructors. The San Jose State professors were surprised at the speed with which the project came together. ""The first word was in November, and it started in January,"" said Ronald Rogers, one of the statistics professors. ""Academics usually form a committee for months before anything happens.""

""Our ego always runs ahead of us, making us think we can do it better than anyone else in the world,"" Dr. Ghadiri said. ""But why should we invent the wheel 10,000 times? This is M.I.T., No. 1 school in the nation -- why would we not want to use their material?"" There are, he said, two ways of thinking about what the MOOC revolution portends: ""One is me, me, me -- me comes first. The other is, we are not in this business for ourselves, we are here to educate students.""","Educators are harnessing online materials to meet the toughest challenges in higher education: giving more students access to college, and helping them graduate on time.",04187a60-25ff-5ee9-98a5-9b89bf866eb5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/04/30/us/jp-MOOC-1/jp-MOOC-1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=1b82f0b1def890056d05ca574986488cc621cc704254837f5459aff9a370b332&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Katie Kormanik preparing to record a statistics course at Udacity, an online classroom instruction provider in Mountain View, Calif.",04187a60-25ff-5ee9-98a5-9b89bf866eb5,N24News/imgs/04187a60-25ff-5ee9-98a5-9b89bf866eb5.jpg,22
Real Estate,Recent Commercial Real Estate Transactions,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/realestate/commercial/recent-commercial-real-estate-transactions.html,"A national law firm, established to defend corporate clients against toxic tort claims and mass tort claims, has signed a five-year lease for a 6,716-square-foot space on part of the second floor of this 28-story TriBeCa building.

Art & Design,"At Frieze New York, Islands of Daring",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/arts/design/frieze-new-york-review-art-fair.html,"The Frieze Art Fair on Randalls Island includes exhibits from nearly 200 galleries from around the world.





Getting into this year's Frieze Art Fair on Randalls Island will cost you $57, plus the round trip on the ferry. But that's nothing compared to what it cost nearly 200 galleries to exhibit there. And so dealers have made the reasonable decision to bring a little of everything that sells -- which may account for the conservative vibe. That said, there are many islands of daring, including special sections focused on solo presentations, small galleries, the influential gallery JAM and virtual reality. We sampled them all -- along with the mainland fairs that are part of Frieze Week. Our art critics Martha Schwendener and Will Heinrich pick a handful of the best booths under Frieze New York's big tent.

One of the strongest single-artist booths is a joint presentation by Bridget Donahue Gallery and LC Queisser, who represent the artist Lisa Alvarado in New York and the Republic of Georgia, respectively. Ms. Alvarado made her acrylic-on-canvas pieces, each painted with a thrilling zigzag pattern, as backdrops for performances by the Natural Information Society, in which she plays the harmonium. If the fair's not too loud, you'll be able to hear the band's hypnotic music, too. WILL HEINRICH

Two exceptional but very different displays are on view in the fair's midsection. At Casey Kaplan gallery, Matthew Ronay's carved wooden sculptures, pieced together into abstract, evocative organic configurations in various coral hues, are placed on plinths and feel like an oasis amid the fair's chaos. (Mr. Ronay also has an exhibition on view at Kaplan's Chelsea location.) Martine Gutierrez continues her rampage as the Indigenous Woman, a transgender alternative-fashionista at Ryan Lee. In photographs and faux-fashion spreads, Ms. Gutierrez combines traditional Mayan and Guatemalan garments and fabrics with fantastic and futuristic accessories and makeup to conjure new, fluid forms of being. MARTHA SCHWENDENER

The Frame section of Frieze, devoted to galleries 10 years or younger, is particularly good this year. Befitting the ethos of the emerging artists they represent, the booths are platforms for performance or installations, with linoleum or AstroTurf covering the floors. The New York gallery Company is hung with paintings by Jonathan Lyndon Chase that feature roughly drawn figures or graffiti, as well as crude sculptures of a plastic bag or a dollar sign. Yanyan Huang treats the booth at Bank, a Shanghai gallery, as an ""immersive portal"" (according to a handout) in which traditional ink drawings merge with digital applications. Nearby, Diedrick Brackens's colorful tapestries at Various Small Fires, which has galleries in Los Angeles and Seoul, South Korea, join traditional materials with references to figures like African-American cowboys. SCHWENDENER

The Tehran gallery Dastan (appearing here as Dastan's Basement) has hung more than 50 portraits by the artist and architect Bijan Saffari. A member of the royal family who left Iran for Paris after his country's 1979 revolution, Mr. Saffari was also gay, which made his position doubly precarious. The portraits are rather simple and conservative, drawn in graphite and colored pencil. And yet they are sensitive and closely observed, and they gain by their group presentation, appearing like a narrative of his circle of friends in the '70s and '80s. There is an elegiac tone to these drawings; the artist died days before the current edition of Frieze opened. SCHWENDENER

Several New York galleries have mounted outstanding painting displays in which artists bend the medium in a variety of ways. At Foxy Production, Srijon Chowdhury, Gina Beavers and Sascha Braunig offer reinventions of Gothic romanticism, surrealism, Op or Pop Art. Simone Subal is showing the work of Emily Mae Smith, whose paintings are slick and whip-smart updates and appropriations of posters from the '70s and '80s. Maryam Hoseini works both on and off the wall at Rachel Uffner, but combines abstracted Persian imagery or techniques with contemporary painting. Sarah Cain's take on painting at Galerie Lelong offers candy colors, cutouts and a floor flooded and stained with pigment. They remind you of paintings' origins -- in childhood -- and suggest a kind of joyful, delirious regression. SCHWENDENER

The fair's outstanding Spotlight section, curated by Laura Hoptman of the Drawing Center, is dedicated to ""significant work by overlooked figures."" They include Yuksel Arslan, a Turkish painter born in 1933 who moved to Paris at the invitation of Andre Breton and died in 2017. His ""Arture 439, Sans Titre, l'Homme,"" from 1992, in a joint presentation by Turkish galleries Galerist and Galeri Nev, is a gloriously strange gallimaufry of interspecies sex acts and quotations from the artist's scientific reading, drawn with homemade colors. Susan Hefuna makes ink drawings inspired by the intricate wooden screens of her Cairo childhood. The examples presented by Pi Artworks of London and Istanbul are done on overlapping sheets of tracing paper fastened with rice glue. The multitude of tones and textures create a fascinating tension between clarity and ambiguity -- the drawings are like letters of a foreign language glimpsed in a dream. HEINRICH

A vibrant knot of color and form awaits you at the intersection of New York's Koenig & Clinton and Kate Werble galleries and Warsaw's lokal_30. From Poland come three painters exemplifying postwar and contemporary Surrealism, among them the young Ewa Juszkiewicz, who repaints classic portraits of women, but hides their faces with cloth, ears of corn or a backward French braid. They evoke feminism, dream logic and implicit violence. Tony Marsh's over-the-top ceramic vessels, encrusted in what look like shards of glaze, meet the eye-bending optical paintings of Anoka Faruqee & David Driscoll at Koenig & Clinton. Marilyn Lerner makes delicately complicated oil-on-wood abstractions at Kate Werble; don't miss the unlabeled low tables by Christopher Chiappa, also in Werble's booth. HEINRICH

Spanish gallery PM8 presents 80 black-and-white photographs by the Lithuanian photographer Gintautas Trimakas, shot in the mid-90s and hung in three long rows. The piece shows 80 women with their heads and legs cropped out. Though the backgrounds range from white to nearly black, and the clothing and body types are all over the map, the typological presentation wears away these differences and leaves the figures all looking more or less interchangeable. It's a deeply cynical take on both the consumerist Western freedoms available to Lithuanians after their 1990 independence and on the fate of all human bodies -- the women aren't so much living people as corpses in waiting. HEINRICH

V.I.P.s have access to the Deutsche Bank Wealth Management Lounge at Frieze New York. But nearly everyone can benefit from PPOW's display of paintings by Steve Keene, which are on sale for $15 to $50. Mr. Keene was heavily influenced by indie rock bands in the early 1990s -- his friends in Pavement, Silver Jews and the Dave Matthews Band -- and the idea of selling quick, sketchily rendered paintings like cassette tapes. Using a stage in PPOW's booth as a pop-up studio, he will produce hundreds of paintings on thin plywood panels -- they are part endurance performance, part public art stunt. The vibe feels like one in a record store during an album release party. SCHWENDENER Through May 5 at Randalls Island Park; frieze.com.

Real Estate,A One-Bedroom and a Sweater for the Dog,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/22/realestate/a-one-bedroom-and-a-sweater-for-the-dog.html,"Josh Collins had never been to New York before last summer. His first trip to the city, on his 22nd birthday, was for a job interview at a software company. Mr. Collins was eager to move. Fresh from the University of Alabama with a computer science degree, he figured the time was right. He had no commitments, no debts -- and no connections, either. As he returned to the airport after his interview, he got a call offering him the job, and he took it. During his brief visit, ""the city lived up to my expectations and then some,"" said Mr. Collins, who is from Knoxville, Tenn. ""I had never seen so many people in one place, all moving. It was super eye-opening and awesome. I had never had a bagel with cream cheese. I ate my way through Midtown."" Mr. Collins had just over a month to line up an apartment, with some relocation help from his new employer. He had no nearby friends or family to stay with. His budget for a rental, which he would share with his dog, Katara, was in the low $2,000s.

Many dog-friendly buildings had restrictions. Katara weighs around 35 pounds, over the limit in some cases. ""She is not a small puppy, and you can't carry her in a purse, which is mainly what places allowed,"" he said. After searching online listings, he found a nice studio, small but with a view, in a dog-friendly Midtown West high-rise condo near 10th Avenue. The owner was subletting it for $2,100 a month.

""I negotiated a rider that stated the owner acknowledged it was fine for me to have a dog, and if the apartment complex decided I had to leave because of her, he would allow me out of my lease,"" Mr. Collins said. The building permitted dogs for owners -- but not for someone subletting. But the agent told him it was just a formality. If need be, the owner would claim that Mr. Collins was merely dog-sitting.

The situation felt shady. ""It is not something I wanted to do under the radar,"" he said. He got his deposit back and started the hunt anew. ""That was kind of a hard hit,"" he said. ""My family and I were way over our heads in how this process works."" A new listing led him to Susan McGettigan, a licensed saleswoman at Citi Habitats. ""She was super-frank, which I loved,"" Mr. Collins said. ""I knew she was not trying to sell me a place; she was trying to find me a home."" With time running short and much of his relocation budget already consumed, Mr. Collins made a second house-hunting trip north. ""I was kind of terrified,"" he said. ""Because of getting hosed with the first agent, I was cautious that I could not take anything at face value. I want to understand every little detail about what I am doing."" His research included neighborhood video tours on YouTube. ""That was really helpful, because I was getting insight into the kind of lifestyle you can expect,"" he said. ""It became a really good tool that I used a lot to figure out what neighborhood I wanted.""

He was inclined toward the East Village, he said, as it had ""more of a younger culture, which was a cool thing for me because I am going to be 22 in the city."" Ms. McGettigan led him around for two days. ""I thought the East Village might be the best fit, but I wanted to give him a kind of smorgasbord tour,"" she said. They started in Midtown West and headed south and east.

An early favorite was a Chelsea one-bedroom directly adjacent to the High Line. Mr. Collins didn't even mind that passers-by could peer in. ""I could get curtains,"" he said. But he did mind that the apartment was on the fourth floor, with no elevator. In the East Village, a renovated second-floor studio with exposed brick was another favorite. ""It didn't have anything bad with it,"" Mr. Collins said. Like many of the places he saw, it was small but clean.

Still, he and Ms. McGettigan had more apartments to see. They were stood up for some appointments. In one case, the landlord wouldn't allow a dog because the unit had just been renovated. Eventually they came to a one-bedroom in the East Village, near Avenue D. ""Most people don't want to be that far east,"" Ms. McGettigan said. ""Josh was O.K. with not being that close to the subway. He wasn't fussy."" This one had a large living room, a bedroom with a sleeping loft, and an enclosed patio. ""I had one other place in my pocket to show,"" she said, but Mr. Collins saw no need. The apartment was bigger and better than the rest. The rent was $2,195, and the broker's fee was 15 percent of a year's rent, or a little less than $4,000.

And Mr. Collins has been eating his way through downtown. ""In Knoxville, the best food is chain food,"" he said, adding that New York fails only when it comes to Southern comfort food. ""In Knoxville, I can't go home at 3 a.m. on Saturday and still order food,"" he said. Now, ""on Seamless, I have it delivered.""

Movies,"No Matter What Rachel McAdams Plays, She Plays for Keeps",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/movies/rachel-mcadams-game-night.html,"Before there was , the Academy Award nominee and tough-as-nails star of films like ""Spotlight"" and television series like ""True Detective,"" and before there was , the romance queen and star of ""The Notebook"" and ""The Time Traveler's Wife,"" there was , who gained wide attention for her go-for-broke performances in comedies like ""The Hot Chick"" (playing a body-swapped Rob Schneider) and ""Mean Girls"" (as the ruthless high-school queen bee Regina George). It's a side of this versatile 39-year-old actress that re-emerges in ""Game Night,"" a new comedy from Warner Bros. that casts her and Jason Bateman as a competitive married couple whose weekly get-together with their friends -- usually reserved for charades and Trivial Pursuit -- takes an unexpected turn into crime, kidnapping and murder. Not that Ms. McAdams sees herself as any of her characters, or feels that any genre best suits her. The actress, who grew up in Canada's Ontario province, says she has tried to keep things unpredictable in an industry that can only imagine you as the last character you played. ""You have to intentionally shake it up sometimes,"" she said. Ms. McAdams spoke about her aggressive side, defying Hollywood's expectations and the effects of sharing a personal #MeToo experience. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.

It was so satisfying to see you take on a flat-out comedic character in ""Game Night."" Why don't you play as many of these roles as you used to? You're puffing up my feathers here. Comedy still really intimidates me. I am in awe of true comedians. Although they work very hard at it, I think it's something they're born with and the rest of us are just running to keep up. Comedies that are a little outside the box just don't come along every day -- and they don't come my way every day, certainly. Is there anything you're as cutthroat about in real life as your character, Annie, is about her game nights? Bingo. Even though it's a game of luck and chance, I take it pretty seriously. I have weird, good bingo karma. It runs in my family. My grandmother used to knit her own special bingo dauber purse that she'd take to the bingo hall with her and she would lay out about 30 cards. I'm not at that point yet, but I hope to be by the time I'm in my 70s. So the next time I'm in a bingo parlor and I see someone in sunglasses and a head scarf, and I think, ""Hey, that looks like  --""?

That's me. [laughs] Whenever we go up to northern Ontario, I go online, look up the local bingo hall and try to sneak in. Did you and your co-stars do anything to bond before shooting started? We did have a game night before we kicked off the film. We're a very Method ensemble. Billy [Magnussen], he's an amazing cook, and he had everybody over to his place. We played Clue. And then we played this game called Joking Hazard, have you heard of that one? It's like Apples to Apples meets Cards Against Humanity. It's a little intense. It is such an interesting social experiment to watch these sides of people come out. And it's always the person that doesn't want to play that won't quit at the end of the night -- the one you drag there, kicking and screaming, that you have to kick out at 3 in the morning. Is there a day that has gone by since ""Mean Girls"" was released where someone didn't remind you about Regina George? Does Regina George haunt me every day? She does have that quality. [laughs] No, I have to thank Regina George for giving me some longevity. I'm forever grateful to Tina Fey [the ""Mean Girls"" screenwriter] and Mark Waters [the director]. I remember when I read it, I called my agent right away and said, ""I will play any part in this, please, please, please."" I was at the beginning of my career, and it was a lofty thing out there, that I really, really, really wanted to do. I'm always looking for larger-than-life characters, which is probably why I like playing villains. They get away with so much. Was that a time in your career when you felt you had to prove yourself a little harder for the roles you wanted?

I'm a neurotic actress, so I still feel that way. [laughs] I don't know that that ever fully goes away. And then if you do prove yourself, you feel like in the next one, you have to prove yourself even more. When you get a chance to act in a big franchise film but the role you're offered is the male lead's love interest, do you think, that's just how it is in Hollywood? Or do you feel you should have a chance to be the person on the movie poster? I certainly don't mind playing supporting roles at all. I would be a basket case if I always played the lead role. Sometimes it's nice to put the same amount of work into a character that has less screen time. You can dig into them but you also get to nap in your trailer for half the day, too. In October, you spoke to Vanity Fair about your experience, while a theater student, of being sexually harassed by the filmmaker James Toback, and Selma Blair has said you gave her support to share her own story. In the months since, have you seen any changes in how the entertainment industry operates? I have to say, I was really inspired by Selma -- I think she's got that the other way around. We spoke to each other before we spoke to Vanity Fair. She was so, so brave, and she gave me courage. It was really amazing to think, that many years later, that you could take your power back a little bit. I never imagined, 17 years ago, when that happened, that I would have this opportunity. I had put it away, on a shelf, and to be able to help in some way is really extraordinary. I feel like the shift has been really palpable, and we're at a real turning point. I'm really grateful to be a witness to it in my lifetime. I love that people are talking and listening and there's compassion. It's a good thing.","Ms. McAdams, of ""Spotlight,"" ""The Notebook"" and ""Mean Girls,"" talks about her competitive side and returning to a comedic role in ""Game Night.""",36a38e11-3320-539f-a04d-f7316ce450b4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/25/arts/25SNAPSHOT/25SNAPSHOT-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=3194a07c66301ce1e3c81a2ed318c2f75b700a22f0db4e22662f4b44a0d5a100&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Rachel McAdams,36a38e11-3320-539f-a04d-f7316ce450b4,N24News/imgs/36a38e11-3320-539f-a04d-f7316ce450b4.jpg,5
Art & Design,'Desert X' Treats Arid Space as a Rich Canvas,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/arts/desert-x-turns-an-arid-space-into-a-canvas.html,"PALM SPRINGS, Calif. -- Roaming off-road through sandy, rock-studded terrain in view of mountain peaks and windmill farms, a six-wheeled rover about the size of a milk crate backed up and sped away from its creator. With infrared detectors to elude heat-producing objects and other sensors to identify solid forms, the bot is in effect programmed to avoid human interaction. She's known as a ""shy bot."" ""She doesn't have consciousness in the classical way, but she is sensitive,"" said the Italian artist behind the bot who, seeking to avoid celebrity himself, goes by the name Norma Jeane. ""She does not want to be bothered.""

The shy bot is one of 16 art projects spread across the Palm Springs, Calif., area from Desert Hot Springs to Coachella as part of the sprawling new exhibition ""Desert X,"" running Saturday through April 30. The bot is also one of several artworks in the show that play with fantasies of the desert as a great existential escape: a refuge for anyone (or anything) seeking to shed the straitjacket of civilization, to vanish from sight or just be left alone under the purportedly sheltering sky.

Other disappearing acts include a mirror-clad ranch house designed by Doug Aitken to reflect and dissolve into its surroundings, a nuclear bunker by Will Boone buried in the sand that holds a sculpture of John F. Kennedy inside and photo-billboards positioned by Jennifer Bolande along the road in such a way so they blend into the mountain landscape behind them around dusk. (All works are free to the public, but some have limited hours.) ""The mythology is the desert is a place to go to find yourself, but in order to do so you have to lose yourself,"" said Neville Wakefield, the New York curator who directed this inaugural show. ""It's about letting everything go in order to find something."" (He said the ""Desert X"" board, which includes local cultural leaders trying to boost the region's reputation as a visual art destination, has not committed to any schedule yet -- ""biennial, triennial or unpredictable."") The Marlboro Man of appropriation art, Richard Prince, found in the desert a bastion of lawlessness as wild as the internet he so often trolls for images. He has taken over an old home in Desert Hot Springs so derelict that it looks like it might have been a meth den in better days. He has not cleaned up the place so much as trashed it with his own art: printing on paper and vinyl sheets images of his Twitter posts about fictional lowlife relatives -- ""family tweets,"" he calls the series -- and plastering them throughout the property. Tweets are stapled to walls, pinned to the floor with rocks and tossed on the scrubby grounds outside, beside soda cups and dirty diapers. Those crumpled-up papers blowing across the front yard like tumbleweed? Yes, those are family tweets, too. One reads: ""I put an ad in a swingers magazine and my mother answered."" The photos printed beneath the tweets range from tacky to pornography. Mr. Wakefield sees it as ""a portrait of American family dysfunction"" but also a self-portrait of the artist. ""The house is the home is the head,"" he quipped.

Of the 16 artists in ""Desert X,"" there are only four women -- ""and too many machos,"" Norma Jeane offered when explaining the female gender he assigned to his bot. Asked about the imbalance, Mr. Wakefield said, ""I'm not a quota curator."" ""The balance was more even at the early stages of conversation, but this is somehow what came out of it,"" he said. ""I don't know if there's a gender affinity with the desert, but historically a lot of the mythologies of the desert -- starting with biblical examples of being cast into the wilderness -- are male."" As it turns out, the work made by women in Desert X proved less spectacle-driven and more contemplative. A sound installation by Lita Albuquerque (with performances not seen by this reporter) centers on a blue female sculpture with her ear to the ground.

The work of the Swiss artist Claudia Comte, a wall nearly 10 feet high and 100 feet long at the base of hiking trails in Palm Desert, might at a distance seem a critique of President Trump's plans for reinforcing the border. But up close, it's clear that the artwork is a painting as much as a wall, covered with repeating black S-patterns that gradually sharpen into zigzags as you walk along it. The wall appears to bulge in spots because of the curves, an optical effect that nods to Op Art painting as well as to heat haze, the shimmering visual distortion that can occur in the desert. At another trailhead further west, near the base of the Whitewater Preserve, the Los Angeles-based Sherin Guirguis has built a domed, earthen sculpture like the pigeon towers popular in Egypt, where she grew up. The towers are typically used to breed the birds for food or sport (and, more rarely, for espionage missions). Her sculpture has niches for birds, but she doesn't expect any to actually use it; she wants viewers to wonder about its significance.","This exhibition, featuring 16 art projects across the Palm Springs, Calif., area, plays off the desert as a great escape.",a070d9e1-a4c0-5400-91f0-c2c021e2216e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/24/arts/25DESERTART5/24DESERTART5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=7ea103fdc8fce340bf94acacc21b8f4640af6ac5994b2e0c1726783c321db779&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The artist Norma Jeane with a bot that will be part of the ""Desert X"" exhibition in California.",a070d9e1-a4c0-5400-91f0-c2c021e2216e,N24News/imgs/a070d9e1-a4c0-5400-91f0-c2c021e2216e.jpg,14
Television,"Conan O'Brien Wants to Scare Himself With the New, Shorter 'Conan'",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/arts/television/conan-obrien-tbs-show-reboot-half-hour.html,"Conan O'Brien backstage at his newly renovated talk show, which debuts Jan. 22. ""What if I tried to, in the most selfish way possible, alter this so that I have a maximum amount of fun?"" he said.

On Oct. 4, 2018, Conan O'Brien hosted the latest episode of ""Conan,"" his long-running TBS late-night talk show. Then he didn't come back with a new episode the following week, or the week after that, and he hasn't for more than three months. This was all by design: On Jan. 22, ""Conan"" will return to TBS with a new look and a different format. Some of the changes to ""Conan,"" which airs Monday through Thursday nights, will be immediately evident: a new set, no more desk and no more house band. Most notably, the show's running time has been cut from an hour to a half-hour. Some of O'Brien's extracurricular activities during his broadcasting break -- projects he unveiled at the end of 2018 like a live tour, a podcast and a new installment of his stand-alone ""Conan Without Borders"" travel specials -- have helped inspire modifications at the TBS program. They've also become brand extensions, providing more sources of revenue as the TV show shrinks. While some of these changes were designed to keep ""Conan"" competitive in the crowded late-night field, O'Brien hopes they will also help the program capture more of the unpredictable comic energy he's been chasing from the moment he succeeded David Letterman as host of NBC's ""Late Night"" in 1993.

When he looked back on himself in those earliest broadcasts, O'Brien told me on Friday, he said he saw a performer attempting to fulfill competing desires. ""We're trying to be anarchists, but I'm trying to be a good boy and do a good job for the network,"" he said. What he's engaged in now, he said, ""is this gradual progression toward me making the job fit me more -- what do I like?"" Over breakfast in Los Angeles, O'Brien talked about the decision to restart ""Conan,"" the changes to the show and what might come next for him in his evolving TV career. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. How does it feel to be so near to resuming the show, after being away for a few months? My analogy is, in surgery, when they have to stop your heart so they can operate on you, there's that weird moment when the doctor must be like, all right, time to start the heart up again! What if it doesn't start? What if I walked out on the first test show and just started openly weeping? But we've done two test shows so far and it feels really good. When did you first have the idea to take a break from the show and reconceive it? Last year, I was coming up on 25 years as a late-night host. It made me realize, wait a minute, really? I remember when Johnny Carson retired, it was 30. At the time, that was such a big part of the story, that someone had had a television show for 30 years. It just struck me that the miles do add up. The repetition can get to you after a while. I was the new guy for so long, and then that card flips overnight -- you go from the inexperienced, nervous punk to the old dean emeritus. I started to think, does it have to be that way? Let's say I've got a couple years left in me. What if I tried to, in the most selfish way possible, alter this so that I have a maximum amount of fun? I decided to scare myself. What led you to these other activities -- the live tour, the podcast, the travel shows? I had done a tour before, but this was no bells and whistles. I started out thinking, I need like 10 minutes up front. Then that became 15, then that became 20, then that become half an hour. By the end it was 40 minutes. It was really liberating.

The podcast was suggested to me as, well, that's a cool space and you might do well in it. It sounded a little strange, and then we tried one where I just interviewed some of my writers, and I loved it. The travel shows opened up my eyes, too, because they're completely outside the realm of anything I do. They can be frightening because they take away a lot of control. I'm out there, I don't often know what I'm going to encounter. What did you take away from these experiences that you could put back into the TV show? The big thing I wanted to do was pull the audience closer and make it like a cool, fun place to do comedy that you might find in Los Feliz or that the Upright Citizens Brigade might have. I wanted it to have a little bit of that compressed feeling, and I like having the audience right there. It feels less presentational in the old-school way. Is that why, for example, you got rid of the traditional host's desk and won't be dressing in a suit and tie anymore?

I grew up revering the format, and then over time, you think, what's feeling like it's vestigial? I really don't miss the desk. It started to feel like I'm doing someone's taxes. None of my guests are wearing suits. I look fine in a suit, and I will wear a suit sometimes. If one of the Obamas stops by, or when Trump comes, as he inevitably will, I'll wear a suit. The most successful things that we've ever done on YouTube are me wearing my Indiana Jones-as-archaeology teacher look. And people accept that. What about reducing the show to a half-hour? Was that a business decision? There were arguments on both sides. Among the guys in rooms that crunch numbers, it's controversial. You sell a lot of ad time in an hour -- you sell half as much in half an hour. This is where this joint-venture idea evolved: We can scale back the show, but we can make Turner partners. We can develop not just my podcast, but the travel shows and these specials with other comedians. I like to use the Rockefeller oil industry as my model. The octopus, if you will, that strangles America.

Does it feel like a blow to be doing a half-hour show when there are still so many other hourlong shows out there? It would if I hadn't been around this long. It also would if there weren't shows like ""The Daily Show,"" and Sam Bee and all these other shows. I know when I've been feeling like we're padding out the show because I've got to get to the full hour. When I know that the part of the show that has the real protein and that people really want, happened in the first half-hour -- literally the first 21, 22 minutes. Do you still have flexibility within that half-hour? We can go long. We might have stuff that I want to try, and we shoot it and it could go in a different show. I might shoot whole extra acts afterward that I just put online. There might be nights where I do an hour of content. TBS gets the half-hour version and some of that other half-hour either goes into a different show or is consumed in a different way. So in your first relaunched show, if you feel like having a longer conversation with Tom Hanks, you can? First of all, here's my strategy with Tom Hanks: rudely interrupt. I know the real Tom Hanks. And he needs to be rudely interrupted. He's a very cruel man in real life. Do these changes affect the creative process of the show? I'll give you an example. An alarm bell, to me, is when the post-mortem meeting feels like drudgery. We've been doing it after every show since the beginning. We all get together in my dressing room and we go through the show act by act. This is how much we're over, this is how much we've got to edit. This is what worked, this is what didn't. How come that bunny puppet didn't blow up when it was supposed to? We had it down so cold that people were on their iPhones. We all go in there, slumped down, yeah, yeah, yeah.

The post-mortems on these two test shows? It's like a knife fight in there. It's, ""This was way too long, how do we cut this?"" ""Wait, that felt weird."" ""Well, I didn't think it felt weird."" ""I don't like the way this looks."" ""I like the way it looks."" It's turbulent and there's conflict and I like it. It's Lenin's Politburo versus Brezhnev's. One is lots of angry disagreement and the other one is like, uhhh, grain production, and everyone knows this has got another five years anyway and then it's going to fall apart but we'll be dead so who cares. These are terrible analogies, by the way. You've referenced the idea of finality a couple of times now. Even though you've got plenty of life left in you, do you feel like you're somehow setting up for your final act? I'm never going to have a better farewell show than I did on ""The Tonight Show."" I loved that show and so I feel, in a weird way, I had my farewell show. I did it. I died, and talked to my grandfather and saw the light and was called back. This concept that I must be the king of late night, I don't even know what that means anymore. I don't know who that is anymore. It's an outmoded concept. I've come to realize that there'll come a point where it's just not even thought of as late night: ""Oh, you make that stuff that makes me laugh."" Is this how you want to go out, with a show that gets smaller and smaller until it's gone? Maybe that's O.K. I think you have more of a problem with that than I do. [Laughs.] At this point in my career, I could go out with a grand, 21-gun salute, and climb into a rocket and the entire Supreme Court walks out and they jointly press a button, I'm shot up into the air and there's an explosion and it's orange and it spells, ""Good night and God love."" In this culture? Two years later, it's going to be, who's Conan? This is going to sound grim, but eventually, all our graves go unattended. You're right, that does sound grim. Sorry. Calvin Coolidge was a pretty popular president. I've been to his grave in Vermont. It has the presidential seal on it. Nobody was there. And by the way, I'm the only late-night host that has been to Calvin Coolidge's grave. I think that's what separates me from the other hosts. I had a great conversation with Albert Brooks once. When I met him for the first time, I was kind of stammering. I said, you make movies, they live on forever. I just do these late-night shows, they get lost, they're never seen again and who cares? And he looked at me and he said, [Albert Brooks voice] ""What are you talking about? None of it matters."" None of it matters? ""No, that's the secret. In 1940, people said Clark Gable is the face of the 20th Century. Who [expletive] thinks about Clark Gable? It doesn't matter. You'll be forgotten. I'll be forgotten. We'll all be forgotten."" It's so funny because you'd think that would depress me. I was walking on air after that.","The host of TBS's ""Conan,"" which returns Jan. 22 in a half-hour format, talks about ditching his desk, embracing the unknown and Calvin Coolidge.

Travel,Springtime Changes at the Airport,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/23/travel/changes-at-the-airport.html,"It may not feel like it in certain parts of the country, but it's finally spring, and changes are underway at the nation's airports, including apps that allow travelers to order food and have it delivered directly to their departure gate, the expansion of biometric boarding using facial recognition technology, and higher execution fees for certain United States passport applicants. Below, a look at the latest developments and coming changes.

Beginning April 2, the execution fee for a United States passport (which is in addition to the $110 application fee for a passport book) will increase to $35 from $25 for some travelers, including first-time passport applicants over the age of 16, children under 16 and people who are reapplying after reporting their passport lost or stolen.

If, however, you're eligible to renew your passport by mail (using an online form called the DS-82) rather than in-person at a post office or with a court clerk, you still pay the usual application fee ($110 for a passport book), but not the $35 execution fee. To find out if you're eligible to renew by mail, visit Travel.state.gov.

Next: Changes at airport gates

In March, San Diego International Airport introduced an app called AtYourGate, a mobile ordering and delivery service that enables passengers to request food (from airport restaurants like Panda Express and Jack-in-the-Box) or an item they may have forgotten to pack (Dramamine, a phone charger, OK! magazine) through their smartphones and have everything delivered to them at their departure gate or elsewhere in the terminal. Before you check out through the app, you can get an estimate of the delivery time, and see the fee. For instance, on a Wednesday afternoon, while contemplating a foam neck pillow from the CNBC News airport store, I could see that delivery would take about 20 to 35 minutes, and that there would be $2.99 delivery charge.","A look at what's new, including apps that enable travelers to order food and headphones at their departure gate, more biometric boarding, and higher fees for some United States passport applicants.",5896b86e-3b6e-5318-ab0f-b4175c60ad25,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/01/travel/01getaway1/01getaway1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=eb83ceb86489c091470392f7b3b1f093c4611fc3ce37017c82348a991c867cb7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Los Angeles International Airport in California, where some passengers may board using facial recognition technology.",5896b86e-3b6e-5318-ab0f-b4175c60ad25,N24News/imgs/5896b86e-3b6e-5318-ab0f-b4175c60ad25.jpg,4

Watch out, Dogecoin. Nicole: My brother will be thrilled. His kids keep finding ways to hack him, and his bank account, via computer games. At least with Minecraft, they'll just be playing with virtual currency. But honestly, I have never played Minecraft. I have no idea what Dogecoin is. Mike: Yeah. I tried to get into Minecraft a little while back, but ended up getting bored and just breaking out my old box of Legos. In unrelated news, I'm a 32-year-old adult male. Moving on, Fitbit's death spiral continues, after its marquee smartwatch continues to be delayed with all sorts of hardware problems. I sort of feel bad for them, but then I remember that it's a company whose product essentially makes me feel guilty for not getting off my couch, and my bad feelings disappear. Do you own a Fitbit? My parents love them, but me not so much. Nicole: I actually sold my Fitbit on eBay. It was chipping away at my soul. Sometimes I just want to eat chicken wings and not tell my stupid fitness apps that I just had a chicken wing. Feel me?

Mike: You have no idea how much I identify. In other news, Apple tacitly confirmed that it is working on autonomous vehicle technology, as the company filed a public permit for testing the tech in California on Friday. Frankly, I'm happy to see them kinda sorta admit this, though who knows when or if it will actually take shape. It had to happen eventually, though, as you can't test a car like you can an iPhone. And if you get drunk and leave your secret car at a bar, people will definitely notice that sort of thing faster than the next secret iPhone. Nicole: Apple C.E.O. Tim Cook has been playing coy about the iCar for a while now. I never understood why they didn't just admit they were working on this. Also, are they calling it the iCar? Because they should.

Mike: Mhmm. But what I really wanted to talk about this week wasn't exactly tech focused. It's the whole United Airlines incident. Unless you've been living in a cave for the past week, you've probably heard about what happened. United overbooked a flight, a customer decided not to leave his seat after the airline started kicking folks off, and the police bloodied the man trying to get him off the flight. The whole thing was caught on video, and it's an epic disaster in every sense. Don't tell Farhad, but I really enjoyed his piece on this. He said, essentially, that technology has failed in improving our airline experience, something that isn't necessarily true for many other industries.

But I wondered something: Farhad makes use of Uber as an example of how technology has significantly improved the experience of getting in a car. That's true for now, but perhaps Uber and other industries like it end up going the way of airlines eventually? If an industry isn't regulated and essentially holds a monopoly over the sector, what keeps Uber from making things worse on consumers over time? We've already been asked to use UberPool, which makes us pack into the car with other people. Perhaps there are other ways to improve Uber's margins over time. Is that me being too cynical? Nicole: Not at all. I stopped using UberPool after my Uber driver picked up a man and a woman wearing shower caps, audibly crying on their way to the airport to say goodbye. It was awkward. Mike: Wow. That's like a short story waiting to be written. Nicole: As for United, I think something like this was bound to happen anytime you outsource your customer service to automation. What happened to this passenger was absolutely horrifying. In this case, a computerized lottery determined he would get dragged down the aisle. The bigger story is that algorithms are widening the gap between businesses and people. Outsourcing these tasks to computers may save companies money in the short term. But these public relations disasters are likely to cost them far more in the long term. United lost $1 billion from its market cap in a day. And I heard one class-action lawyer on CNN say the passenger could get a dollar for every person who has watched the video of him being bloodied up by airport cops. That's a lot of dollars. The irony is that this guy will never have to fly commercial again. Mike: I'm reorganizing my retirement plans around such a scenario. Is there anything in the security world I should be paying attention to right now? I probably have to change all my passwords or something, huh? Nicole: Security is a lost cause at this point. Just make sure you use different passwords for different sites and maybe stop using I<3Farhad420. Mike: Hmm. I'll think about it. Nicole: Actually, the big story in security this week was an epic hack of Dallas's emergency sirens that set off some 150 emergency sirens across the city last Friday and sent people flooding 911 operators with calls. Increasingly, we're going to see this style of hacks play out as more and more of our infrastructure migrates online. Until now, everyone's just been hooking up their smart fridges, thermostats, traffic lights, bodies online, which is cool, until you get hacked and someone's pumping you full of insulin. Uplifting, isn't it?

Mike: We are all so dead. Nicole: Oh, and before we go, can we please talk about how Burger King essentially hacked Google Home with its ad this week? The company slipped an ""O.K. Google, what is a Whopper burger?"" into its television ad this week and next thing people knew, their Google Home device was telling them all the wonderful, and I'm sure perfectly organic, ingredients that go into a Whopper. Then Google tweaked its algorithms to make sure Google Home stopped responding to the ad, but it seems like the possibilities for marketers to exploit these in-home devices are endless. I'm sure we could find a way to order 100 pizzas to Farhad's house while he's off gallivanting. Mwwuuhahahaha! Mike: Nicole, I'm not going to lie: I really like that you're back from book leave. Please feel free to join me in conspiring against Farhad anytime you wish.","Mike Isaac and Nicole Perlroth discuss the week's technology news, including Burger King's latest stunt with Google Home devices.",6e4a940d-8164-52d3-976c-df43d1feaaeb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/16/business/16technewsletter/16technewsletter-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=f1115ac783e2deb0a7a3d63e999851da8920d39682ca8b6f2753b0cb7e273c5d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Burger King introduced a commercial that prompted voice-activated Google Home devices to describe its burgers — until Google made sure Google Home ignored it.,6e4a940d-8164-52d3-976c-df43d1feaaeb,N24News/imgs/6e4a940d-8164-52d3-976c-df43d1feaaeb.jpg,20
Sports,El Cholo's Last Stand,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/sports/soccer/atletico-liverpool-diego-simeone.html,"Almost a decade ago, Diego Simeone set out to annoy Europe's elite with Atletico Madrid. But what happens when the underdog joins the aristocrats?

MADRID -- Diego Simeone loved the way the sunlight hit the stands at the Vicente Calderon. First as an Atletico Madrid player, and then as its manager, he relished home games in the stadium in late afternoon, when he could look up from the field and see the red and white seats glinting in the waning glow. That was when he felt the stadium's energy on the touchline, when the sun shone and the banners fluttered and the songs drifted down from on high. Simeone spent a considerable portion of his professional life in that stadium, but he was never inoculated against its power. ""The Calderon has an ability to affect you,"" he said. Simeone knew, when he agreed to take charge of Atletico a few days after Christmas in 2011, that he would have to harness that power. He understood, he felt, what the club's fans wanted, what sort of team would be in line with Atletico's history, its identity, what style of play would win the backing of the Calderon. His team, he told The Coaches' Voice a few years later, would have to be built on a strong defense, a deadly counterattack and an unyielding work ethic. Simeone, the player known as El Cholo, was creating his own philosophy: Cholismo. ""The only thing that is not negotiable is effort,"" he told his players in their first meeting. Most of all, he said, Atletico had to be a thorn in the side of the superpowers.

He and his team have delivered on that promise. By almost any metric, Simeone's tenure as Atletico's manager has been an unqualified, spectacular success. The trophies are, of course, the most obvious proof. Under Simeone, Atletico has lifted the Europa League and the European Super Cup twice, in 2012 and 2018. He won the Copa del Rey, against Real Madrid, in 2013, and led the club to the Champions League final in 2014 and 2016. Most important, of course, he led Atletico to the Spanish title in 2014 -- sealed on enemy territory in Barcelona, too. It was the club's first championship for almost two decades, and the first time in 10 years that a team other than Barcelona or Real Madrid had won the Spanish crown. It is a remarkable haul for a team that was, until recently, known for its ability to fall at the last, for its perpetual disappointment. Atletico has long been known, by fans and foes alike, as El Pupas: the Jinxed. The nickname does not come up so much, these days.

Even more telling, perhaps, is the sea change in Atletico's fortunes off the field. His success has effectively wiped out the club's soaring debts, and attracted the kind of deep-pocketed foreign sponsors -- China's Wanda group, Azerbaijan's tourism board, an Israeli billionaire -- that helped pay for a new stadium, for higher salaries, for new players. Last summer, Atletico spent $142 million on a single player -- Joao Felix -- and a further $100 million on strengthening the squad. Atletico, in other words, is no longer the poor relation: It has paid more for a player than Real Madrid, and it reportedly pays its coach more than any team in the world. On Tuesday, when Atletico hosts Liverpool in the last 16 of the Champions League, it will not be at Simeone's beloved Calderon. The club left its longtime home in 2017 for the Wanda Metropolitano, a state-of-the-art but slightly soulless bowl on Madrid's northern fringes, one grand enough to be the stage on which Liverpool won last season's Champions League final. Atletico is close to opening an equally lavish training base, too, one that -- according to Simeone -- ""lives up to what the club deserves."" At last, in his eyes, the ""growth of the club is parallel to that of the team."" Simeone still regards Atletico as ""socially, morally and emotionally the people's team,"" but even he acknowledges its image, and its status, have changed. In 2012, as his team prepared to face Chelsea in the European Super Cup, Simeone declared that the English club's vast financial superiority was irrelevant. ""Heart can cancel out budget,"" he declared then. For years, that was how Atletico competed, how it ensured its cherished place as European soccer's great irritant. Now it does not need to. That is the extent of what Simeone has achieved: He has helped the eternal outsider crash through the doors of the palace. Atletico is now part of Europe's elite. The question most are asking, now, is where that leaves the coach who took it there. Simeone wanted more energy. Not, in that precise moment, from his team -- toiling at home to Bayer Leverkusen in a Champions League group game in October -- but from the fans. Midway through the second half, with the game goalless, he paused in his characteristic prowling around the technical area to turn to the crowd with his fist raised, demanding more noise, more power.

Even so, that moment was striking. Simeone always knew, instinctively, what Atletico wanted. The club's modern identity was entwined with his. Yet for the first time in almost a decade, discord was in the air. As Simeone prepares for the visit of Liverpool, there is a fragile peace. This has been a testing season. Atletico sits fourth in La Liga, cut adrift from Real and Barcelona in the title race, and behind even Getafe, an unheralded team from one of Madrid's satellite towns. It was eliminated from the Copa del Rey by a second-division side. Its defensive parsimony remains: Only Real Madrid has conceded fewer goals this season. Simeone's training sessions are still a reference point for teams across Europe. Last summer, seeking inspiration for how to improve its own defense, Bournemouth sent a delegation just to watch how he worked. The problem is his team's toothlessness. Atletico has scored only 25 goals in 24 games. Given the amount of money spent last summer, particularly on Joao Felix, to try to make the team more expansive, it is a paltry return. Simeone is conscious of this. He tried to sign Edinson Cavani, the Uruguay striker, in January to give the team more cutting edge. He has met in recent weeks with Miguel Angel Gil, Atletico's chief executive, and the sporting director Andrea Berta to discuss how to improve the team's attacking performance without compromising its resilience.

What Atletico -- as a club, as a fan base -- demands of its team has changed, mutated in some way along the road from the Calderon to the Metropolitano. As one associate of Simeone's noted, there is an unavoidable incongruity in playing underdog soccer in an aristocrat's home. ""In Cholismo, the result is God,"" the former Argentina forward Jorge Valdano -- now a columnist for El Pais, and one of Spain's most erudite soccer observers -- wrote last year. That was always Simeone's logic, and his defense: As long as his philosophy produced results, there could be no complaints. This season, it is not working. Simeone has not been able to craft a more attacking team, and all of Atletico's old virtues have not been enough. In the absence of God, Simeone's congregation has started to doubt its faith. In recent years, Simeone has lent his name to two books, in collaboration with the journalist Santi Garcia Bustamante. Both sit more comfortably on the lifestyle shelves than in the sports section. In the second, longer edition -- entitled simply ""Creer,"" or ""Believe"" -- Simeone writes: ""When the opposition team sense that there is fear, they take advantage without mercy."" For much of the last decade, that could have functioned as a summary of what made Atletico great. Now, it encapsulates as well as anything the problem it is facing. Opponents no longer fear Atletico; instead, they detect an uncertainty, an anxiety, in Simeone's team, one that bounces and echoes between the field and the stands. Ordinarily, the visit of Liverpool -- the reigning European and world champion, a side unbeaten in the Premier League and hailed last week by Lionel Scaloni, the Argentina coach, as the only ""invincible"" team in the world -- would be a calvary for a team struggling for form.

Far less certain is what comes after. Simeone retains his aura and the faith of most of his players, though those inside the club admit that perhaps the squad's dynamics are suffering because so many of his most trusted lieutenants -- the likes of Diego Godin and Gabi -- have departed. His aura has not dissipated. As one player noted, Atletico is still the sort of club where nobody is ever late for a team meeting. A year ago, the manager extended his contract until 2022. But there is a feeling that change is coming. German Burgos, Simeone's longstanding assistant, is keen to start his own managerial career; it was telling that he did not sign a new contract when Simeone did. The biggest question is what happens to Simeone. He might be able to go through his back catalog, to play the greatest hits, to pick a way past Liverpool. The greater challenge, though, is to find a way to update Cholismo to reflect Atletico's new circumstances, to develop a style that suits a team that is no longer always content to be the underdog and a club that demands entertainment with its efficacy. Atletico's identity is now fused with Simeone's. It is hard to imagine one without the other. But Simeone, for one, has never believed in his own immutability. ""I always leave before they kick me out,"" he once said. ""And I always believe they can kick me out tomorrow."" After almost nine years, that moment of reckoning may be coming. Liverpool might be his last hurrah. It might also be his last stand.","Almost a decade ago, Diego Simeone set out to annoy Europe's elite with Atlético Madrid.

Food,Rum Enthusiasts Have a New Obsession: Fresh-Cut Sugar Cane,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/dining/drinks/craft-rum-liquor.html,"Among aficionados of craft spirits, the obsessive quest for the ""authentic,"" ""pure"" and ""rustic"" intensifies with each passing year. Not too long ago, rhum agricole from Martinique or Guadeloupe -- a rum distilled from the juice of fresh-cut sugar cane, following strict rules enforced by an ""appellation d'origine controlee"" in France -- might have satisfied those nebulous ideals. Most rum in the Caribbean is made from molasses, the byproduct of refining sugar cane. By definition, molasses-based rums are more processed than those made from fresh sugar cane. So it makes sense that a rhum agricole, with its grassy, smoky, funky notes, would seem more ""pure."" Many enthusiasts consider these to be the world's finest expressions of rum. But over the past several months, an unaged rum from Haiti called clairin, also made from fresh-pressed sugar cane juice, began popping up on cocktail menus. Clairin certainly ticks all the romantic boxes. Authentic? Clairin is distilled in remote Haitian villages, often by homemade stills in the same way it has since the 19th century. Pure? Clairin is made from native, sometimes wild, sugar cane varieties that have been lost elsewhere in the Caribbean. Rustic? The raw ingredient is usually transported on horseback and often crushed by the power of oxen.

Mr. Biondi poured three expressions of clairin, each bottle named for the distiller (Clairin Casimir or Clairin Vaval), listing the village, the variety of sugar cane (such as Hawaii or Madame Meuze) and noting that it's spontaneously fermented with wild yeast. ""Pure sugar cane juice rum is always a bit more sophisticated,"" Mr. Biondi said. ""Molasses is just not a complex raw material."" These were fiery, spicy, edgy rums, all clocking in at more than 96 proof. ""They're funky and unique and cross a lot of different categories,"" said Sother Teague, Amor y Amargo's beverage director, from behind the bar. ""Funky like Jamaican rum, grassy like rhum agricole, earthy like mezcal."" Mr. Biondi enjoyed the mention of mezcal. ""We always make the comparison with mezcal,"" he said. ""Comparing clairin with rhum agricole is like comparing mezcal with tequila.""

For several years, craft mezcal -- made from wild agave, cooked under the earth and distilled once in small batches -- has been the darling mark of authenticity for the cocktail crowd. Producers of other spirits have sought to duplicate its credibility and success. Call it the mezcal-ification of spirits. But how much does this really help American consumers understand an unfamiliar liquor? ""There's a real desperation for lots of these spirits to say they're the 'mezcal' of whatever because of economic success,"" said Bobby Heugel, the owner of several high-profile bars in Houston, including Anvil Bar & Refuge and the Pastry War, that have extensive mezcal and rum lists. One group, unsurprisingly, has not appreciated La Maison & Velier's sales pitch as the mezcal of rum: those who produce and import Martinique rhum agricole. ""I've had more questions about clairin lately than anything else. It's more confusion, more noise,"" said Ed Hamilton, whose company Caribbean Spirits imports Neisson, La Favorite and Duquesne rhum agricole. Ben Jones, the owner of Spiribam, which imports Rhum Clement and Rhum JM from Martinique, thinks this ""clairin wildfire"" is good publicity for all pure sugar cane rums. ""But all of a sudden, we're cast as Jose Cuervo or Patron?"" he said. "" It's like, chill out, bro. When someone says the best rum in the world has to come from a still made from car parts, or the sugar cane has to be delivered by an animal, that's just counterproductive."" The whole notion of pure sugar cane rum is a relatively new concept for Americans. Both Mr. Jones and Mr. Hamilton introduced their rhum agricoles from Martinique to the United States in 2005. ""I'd have people ask me if I'd spell-checked my label because I'd left an 'h' in the word rhum,"" Mr. Jones said.

Martin Cate, the rum expert and author of ""Smuggler's Cove: Exotic Cocktails, Rum, and the Cult of Tiki,"" now has 46 Martinique rhum agricoles and 26 Guadeloupe rhum agricoles on the menu at Smuggler's Cove, his popular tiki bar in San Francisco. At his bars, Mr. Cate steers drinkers who like the grassy notes of tequila or the vegetal notes of Scotch toward rhum agricole. Mr. Cate says that both rhum agricole and clairin provide what he calls ""an authentic experience of terroir.""

""It's hard not to be drawn to the authenticity of these projects,"" he said. ""There's a real passion for products that are out of the grasp of large industrial companies."" But Mr. Cate acknowledges that modern craft bartenders have ""asbestos palates, and they want to be shocked,"" and are therefore inevitably drawn to spirits like clairin. Mr. Teague, for instance, is already trying to develop cocktails with clairin for Amor y Amargo and the neighboring bar, Cienfuegos. ""The overwhelming majority of my job is talking to people and getting them to drink new things,"" he said. ""With clairin, there's definitely something new to talk about."" Rhum agricole and clairin, distilled from the juice of fresh-cut sugar cane, can be a new experience for those used to sipping molasses-based rums. Complex grassy, funky and earthy flavors are balanced by the underlying sweetness. Here is a selection of both aged and unaged examples to seek out. (All bottles are 750 milliliters.)

Health,"Ebola Vaccine, Ready for Test, Sat on the Shelf",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/24/health/without-lucrative-market-potential-ebola-vaccine-was-shelved-for-years.html,"The University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, site of a lab where researchers are working with Ebola and other viruses.

GALVESTON, Tex. -- Almost a decade ago, scientists from Canada and the United States reported that they had created a vaccine that was 100 percent effective in protecting monkeys against the Ebola virus. The results were published in a respected journal, and health officials called them exciting. The researchers said tests in people might start within two years, and a product could potentially be ready for licensing by 2010 or 2011. It never happened. The vaccine sat on a shelf. Only now is it undergoing the most basic safety tests in humans -- with nearly 5,000 people dead from Ebola and an epidemic raging out of control in West Africa. Its development stalled in part because Ebola is rare, and until now, outbreaks had infected only a few hundred people at a time. But experts also acknowledge that the absence of follow-up on such a promising candidate reflects a broader failure to produce medicines and vaccines for diseases that afflict poor countries. Most drug companies have resisted spending the enormous sums needed to develop products useful mostly to countries with little ability to pay. Now, as the growing epidemic devastates West Africa and is seen as a potential threat to other regions as well, governments and aid groups have begun to open their wallets. A flurry of research to test drugs and vaccines is underway, with studies starting for several candidates, including the vaccine produced nearly a decade ago.

With no vaccines or proven drugs available, the stepped-up efforts are a desperate measure to stop a disease that has defied traditional means of containing it. ""There's never been a big market for Ebola vaccines,"" said Thomas W. Geisbert, an Ebola expert here at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, and one of the developers of the vaccine that worked so well in monkeys. ""So big pharma, who are they going to sell it to?"" Dr. Geisbert added: ""It takes a crisis sometimes to get people talking. 'O.K. We've got to do something here.' "" Dr. James E. Crowe Jr., the director of a vaccine research center at Vanderbilt University, said that academic researchers who developed a prototype drug or vaccine that worked in animals often encountered a ""biotech valley of death"" in which no drug company would help them cross the finish line.

To that point, the research may have cost a few million dollars, but tests in humans and scaling up production can cost hundreds of millions, and bringing a new vaccine all the way to market typically costs $1 billion to $1.5 billion, Dr. Crowe said. ""Who's going to pay for that?"" he asked. ""People invest in order to get money back."" The Ebola vaccine on which Dr. Geisbert collaborated is made from another virus, V.S.V., for vesicular stomatitis virus, which causes a mouth disease in cattle but rarely infects people. It had been used successfully in making other vaccines.

The researchers altered V.S.V. by removing one of its genes -- rendering the virus harmless -- and inserting a gene from Ebola. The transplanted gene forces V.S.V. to sprout Ebola proteins on its surface. The proteins cannot cause illness, but they provoke an immune response that in monkeys, considered a good surrogate for humans, fought off the disease. The vaccine was actually produced in Winnipeg, Manitoba, by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The Canadian government patented it, and 800 to 1,000 vials of the vaccine were produced. In 2010, it licensed the vaccine, known as VSV-EBOV, to NewLink Genetics in Ames, Iowa. The Canadian government donated the existing vials to the World Health Organization, and safety tests of the vaccine in healthy volunteers have begun. NewLink's product is one of two leading vaccines being tested. The other, which uses a cold virus that infects chimpanzees, was developed by researchers at the National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline. The first tests of an earlier version of it, employing a different cold virus, began in 2003.

Several other vaccine candidates, not as far along, are also in the pipeline and may be ready for safety testing next year. Once any drugs or treatments pass the safety tests, they will be available for use in larger numbers of people, and health officials are grappling with whether they should be tested for efficacy in the traditional way, in which some people at risk are given placebos instead of the active drug.

Governments and the military became interested in making vaccines against Ebola and a related virus, Marburg, during the 1990s after a Soviet defector said the Russians had found a way to weaponize Marburg and load it into warheads. Concerns intensified in 2001 after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and anthrax mailings. ""The National Institutes of Health came up with a program called Partnerships in Biodefense that partnered researchers like me with companies, usually small companies,"" Dr. Geisbert said. The government money led to major advances in the laboratory, Dr. Geisbert said, but was insufficient to cover the huge costs of human trials. Nor could the small companies that were involved in the early studies in animals afford to pay for human trials. No finished product came to market. Dr. Geisbert moved on, working on treatments for Ebola and another version of the V.S.V. vaccine. For the vaccine work, his main collaborator has been Dr. Heinz Feldmann, the chief of virology at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Mont., part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

The newer version of the vaccine uses a slightly different form of V.S.V., one that Dr. Geisbert said he thought might be less likely to cause side effects, and more likely to gain quick approval because it has been used as the basis for an H.I.V. vaccine and is known to the Food and Drug Administration. But the new version, VesiculoVax, made by Profectus Biosciences in Baltimore, has not yet been tested in humans.

The V.S.V. products are live vaccines, with replicating viruses that may cause a reaction. It is not clear what level of side effects will be considered acceptable. Chills and nausea are possible, Dr. Geisbert said, but he added, ""Who cares, if you survive Ebola?"" Most vaccines are given to prevent disease before people are exposed to it, and the plan is to use Ebola vaccines that way. But the V.S.V. vaccines have also been shown to protect monkeys even after the animals have been exposed to a heavy dose of Ebola -- if given soon after exposure. Researchers hope that they will work that way for people, too. If they do, health workers and family members who have been in contact with a patient might be protected, instead of having to spend 21 days of dread, waiting to see if they get sick. Dr. Geisbert spends much of his time working with Ebola and other deadly viruses in a Biosafety Level 4 laboratory at the Galveston National Laboratory, where the researchers wear spacesuits that each come with an independent air supply, and visiting journalists are required not to report which floor the labs are on. This month, one of his tasks is to test the Profectus vaccine and an experimental treatment against the Ebola strain that is causing the current epidemic. The virus is from a species called Ebola Zaire, against which the products have already been shown to work. But different strains within a species can vary genetically by 2 percent to 7 percent, Dr. Geisbert said. Most of the time, those small variations do not matter, and a drug or treatment that works against one strain will work against all. But once in a while, the difference matters.

Sports,Tiger Woods Starts Strong at the Masters as Paul Casey Leads an Incomplete Round,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/12/sports/golf/masters-leaderboard-day-1.html,"Because Woods has won the tournament five times and has been a Masters fixture for the past 25 years, it is possible he has played the golf course in those conditions. And probably still broken par. Woods, the reigning champion, was not the leader after Thursday's first-round play, which was delayed by a nearly three-hour thunderstorm that left dozens of golfers unable to finish their sessions. With a four-under-par 68, Woods was tied for fourth and quietly three strokes behind the leader, Paul Casey. But Woods's commanding round was the loudest statement of the day. It has been an up-and-down year for Woods, but on this day he was composed and virtually never out of position on the devilish Augusta National layout. It almost seemed that he was on cruise control, as if he could coast to a 68. ""I did everything well today,"" Woods, who is not prone to self-congratulation, said after his round.

Every other seasoned contender in the field knows the Masters history when Woods has a good opening round. It is not true that he has won every time he has shot 70 or better in the first round. It has, however, happened four times. He has seriously contended on the three other occasions when he has been two strokes or more under par after the first day, finishing fourth twice and sixth once. When Woods was asked if he was surprised at how well he had played given his uneven performances during the bulk of this season, he shrugged. ""Understanding how to play this golf course is just a big part of playing well here,"" he said. ""It's so familiar."" He knows the territory; he could find the television remote in the dark of his living room, too.

""There were a lot of differences today,"" Woods said. ""There was a drone flying over the green. You don't hear drones here. There were no patrons, no roars. A lot of firsts today. That's kind of the way this entire year has been."" Many players had the same sense of being in recognizable, yet altered, place. Xander Schauffele shot a brilliant 67 to finish the day in a tie for second with Webb Simpson, but he seemed unsure about what to make of his round. ""A lot of it felt wrong, in all honesty,"" Schauffele said. ""The greens are really soft, so there isn't a whole lot to be scared of. It was really strange. You would play less break on putts and hit it harder, which is something you never do here."" Casey, who has had five top-10 finishes in 13 previous Masters appearances, made an eagle on the second hole with an approach shot that he expected to end up over the green. ""I hit a 6-iron to a left-hand pin on No. 2, and you can't hit that shot in April,"" Casey said. ""Today, it just pitched and stopped instantly. In April, it would have one-hopped over into the patrons. I probably make five, not three."" But when it comes to entertaining, unforeseen moments in this first round of the Masters, it would hard to beat the sight of seven golfers, caddies and officials chest high in the azaleas in search of Bryson DeChambeau's wayward ball.

After starting his round on the 10th hole, DeChambeau knocked his tee shot on No. 13 into the trees and tried for a delicate recovery. Instead, he badly hooked his ball and it ended up buried in the bushes behind the green. Then, in case he did not find that ball, DeChambeau hit a provisional shot that landed in Rae's Creek, short of the green.","Casey shot seven under par on Thursday, and Woods was four under, after rain delayed the start of tournament and left many golfers with unfinished rounds.",df1d0f55-b50e-5fc9-a00c-69d159715e9d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/12/sports/12golf-leadall02/merlin_179946624_8c1880c3-44a9-4297-a1f1-4f73b24b4bb7-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=443d8612cfbe54fa8d2ad4f9c11b817c30f03f3eb88ff1acb2c20cf13dfbeda1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Tiger Woods on the 14th tee at the Masters on Thursday.

Economy,Job Creation Is Still Steady Despite Worry,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/business/economy/us-economy-adds-155000-jobs-jobless-rate-is-7-8.html,"Despite concerns about looming tax increases and government spending cuts, American employers added 155,000 jobs in December. Employees also enjoyed slightly faster wage growth and worked longer hours, which could bode well for future hiring. The job growth, almost exactly equal to the average monthly growth in the last two years, was enough to keep the unemployment rate steady at 7.8 percent, the Labor Department reported on Friday. But it was not enough to reduce the backlog of 12.2 million jobless workers, underscoring the challenge facing Washington politicians as they continue to wrestle over how to address the budget deficit. ""Job creation might firm a little bit, but it's still looking nothing like the typical recovery year we've had in deep recessions in the past,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics. ""There's nothing in the deal to do that,"" he said, referring to Congress's Jan. 1 compromise on taxes, ""and nothing in this latest jobs report to suggest that. We're a long way short of the 300,000 job growth that we need."" If anything, the most visible debt-related options that policy makers are discussing could slow down economic and job growth, which, at its existing pace, would take seven years to reduce the unemployment rate to its prerecession level. The $110 billion in across-the-board federal spending cuts scheduled for March 1, for example, might provoke layoffs by local governments, military contractors and other companies that depend on federal funds.

A showdown over the debt ceiling expected in late February could also damage business confidence, as it did the last time Congress nearly allowed a default on the nation's debts in August 2011. ""We may be seeing the calm before the storm right now,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors, noting that a recent survey from the National Federation of Independent Business found that alarmingly few small companies planned to hire in the coming months. ""Small businesses are wringing their hands in horror at what's going on in Washington.""

A best case for the economy, many analysts say, would involve a swift and civil Congressional agreement that raised the debt ceiling immediately. It would also address the country's long-term debt challenges, like Medicare costs, without sudden or draconian fiscal tightening this year. Given the uncertainty over what Congress will do, estimates of the unemployment rate's path this year vary wildly. The more optimistic forecasts for the end of 2013 predict that unemployment will fall to just above 7 percent, which would be considerably below its most recent peak of 10 percent in October 2009, but still higher than its prerecession level of 5 percent.

The job gains in December were driven by hiring in health care, food services, construction and manufacturing. The last two industries were probably helped by rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions. Aside from the wild card of what happens in Washington, some encouraging trends in the economy -- including the housing recovery, looser credit for small businesses, a rebound in China and pent-up demand for new automobiles -- suggest that businesses have good reason to speed up hiring. Congress's last-minute deal to raise taxes this week will offset some of these sources of growth, since higher taxes trim how much money consumers have available each month. President Obama's proposals to spend more money on infrastructure projects and other measures intended to spur hiring are fiercely opposed by Republican deficit hawks. The fiscal compromise reached this week did include one modest form of stimulus, though: a one-year renewal of the federal government's emergency unemployment benefits program. That program allows workers to continue receiving benefits for up to 73 weeks, depending on the unemployment rate in the state where they live, and stimulates economic activity because unemployment benefits are spent almost immediately. The extension was a tremendous relief to the two million workers who would otherwise have lost their benefits this week.

Both she and her husband, Stephen, were laid off within the last 14 months from jobs they had held for more than a decade: she from a quality assurance manager position at an environmental testing lab, and he as foreman and senior master technician at an auto dealership. They are each receiving $548 a week in federal jobless benefits, or about a quarter of their pay at their most recent jobs. ""It has just been such a traumatic time,"" Ms. Shadis said. ""You wake up in the morning with shoulders tense and head aching because you didn't sleep the night before from worrying."" More than six million workers have exhausted their unemployment benefits since the recession began in December 2007, according to the National Employment Law Project, a labor advocacy group. Millions of workers are sitting on the sidelines and so are not counted in the tally of unemployed. Some are merely waiting for the job market to improve, and others are trying to invest in new skills to appeal to employers who are already hiring. ""I have a few prospects who say they want me to work for them when I graduate,"" said Jordan Douglas, a 24-year-old single mother in Pampa, Tex., who is enrolled in a special program that allows her to receive jobless benefits while attending school full time to become a registered nurse. She receives $792 in benefits every two weeks, a little less than half of what she earned in an administrative position at the nursing home that laid her off last year. Ms. Douglas calculates that her federal jobless benefits will run out the very last week of nursing school. ""This had to have been a sign from God that I had to do this, since it all worked out so well,"" she said.","Employers added 155,000 jobs in December, about apace with job growth over the last year, the Labor Department reported on Friday.

Opinion,When Innovation Looks Like Dancing Dinosaurs,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/opinion/coronavirus-business-new-york.html,"Mr. Winter is a staff photographer on assignment in Opinion. Ms. Lockwood is a fellow in the Times Opinion section.





The hotel lobby is open daily from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m., and on Sundays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Access to the store is limited to six people at a time, and everyone has to use hand sanitizer when they enter and exit. People can only touch the food that they are going to buy. Customers bag their own items. No one shakes hands. At first, standing six feet apart in the improvised grocery store was awkward. ""Now it's just normal,"" Ms. Broderick said. Hank Faber lives in a townhouse on the resort property and walks to the new grocery store to buy milk, eggs, produce and frozen meals. Mr. Faber was formerly relying on Meals on Wheels, but has transitioned to shopping at Greek Peak for food. Mr. Faber is legally blind, and his only complaint about the store is that the lighting is low. ""They usually help me pick out the stuff I need,"" he said.

Ayden Wilber, the resort's director of operations, had the idea to take its new food delivery service one step further. Greek Peak is ""not as well known for delivery, so we were trying to come up with a way to make ourselves a little bit unique,"" he said. While perusing Amazon, Mr. Wilber found and ordered two inflatable dinosaur costumes: one for himself and one for Sean O'Brien, a banquet chef. The costumes arrived on March 25. The next day, the two men delivered pizzas to a family in the dino suits while dancing to ""Uptown Funk"" by Bruno Mars. One of the employees filmed the delivery and posted it to Facebook. ""This for making people's day with a little extra Love!!! I mean BIG extra LOVE,"" one person commented. ""Great job guys, you made my day,"" another added. Soon, they were getting more delivery calls than they could manage. ""I didn't expect the video to go so viral,"" Mr. Wilber said.

The process is quick -- Mr. Wilber and Mr. O'Brien shuffle out of the van, maintaining a six-foot distance from customers. They wear gloves on their hands. One of the dinosaurs unzips the pizza from the bag that keeps it warm and leaves it on the ground at a safe distance. Then, they dance back into the van. ""I don't have very good dance skills so I sort of followed Ayden as much as I could,"" Mr. O'Brien said. ""It's funny because if you have a long driveway you can sort of get into the character and dance a little bit."" Short driveways are more difficult, he explains. It's harder to build the anticipation. Their goal is to ""make people laugh and lighten the mood,"" Mr. O'Brien said. ""Ironically, I'm a relatively shy person so getting inside it is a task in itself, but then the realization that no one knows who you are is a little more comforting.""

Angela Gellatly of Cortland received a delivery on April 1 for her family: two pizzas, fried calamari, a salad and mozzarella sticks. She had been to the indoor water park at Hope Lake Lodge, and saw the video of the dinosaur delivery on Facebook. ""We're bored,"" Ms. Gellatly said. ""I think it's genius what they did."" Her family had decided to avoid takeout because of fears about contamination, but they broke that resolve for the dinosaurs. The delivery was an April Fool's joke for her 6-year-old daughter. ""I think that more people should follow their lead,"" Ms. Gellatly said. ""Any kind of entertainment and joy and happiness that we can have right now, I think we have to seize the moment.""

Style,A Golf Lesson With Bridget Moynahan,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/01/style/bridget-moynahan.html,"Credit...George Etheredge for The New York Times





Bridget Moynahan doesn't understand people who don't understand the appeal of watching golf. ""I don't think it's boring,"" said Ms. Moynahan, 48, a star of the police drama ""Blue Bloods,"" which was just renewed for a 10th season. ""I find it really relaxing."" But when it comes to playing golf, relaxing is not quite the word she'd choose to describe her sorties around the course. More like agonizing. Terrifying. Stomach churning. Eager to address those fears, and to better address that little dimpled ball, Ms. Moynahan booked a private lesson at Chelsea Piers Golf Academy. She showed up on a windy morning not long ago, hair bundled into a ponytail and wearing the comfortable clothes that had been advised: cropped khaki pants, the legs decorated with cave-style drawings of the faces of cats and dogs; a gray button-down shirt; very white Adidas shoes. She shook hands with her instructor, Chance Scheffing, and was directed to a simulator on the fourth floor overlooking the Hudson River.

""I find golf an intimidating game because when you're bad you're really bad,"" said Ms. Moynahan, also the author, with, Amanda Benchley, of ""Our Shoes, Our Selves."" The recently published coffee-table book features 40 high-profile women (including Christiane Amanpour, the four-star-general Ann Dunwoody and Senators Tammy Duckworth, Susan Collins and Patty Murray) discussing their most meaningful footwear. Ms. Moynahan writes about a pair of black leather Miu Miu motorcycle boots that were bought on impulse during a trying period in her life. ""Any injuries that we should be aware of?"" said Mr. Scheffing, who seemed very fond of the majestic first-person plural. ""There is, like, a shoulder-neck issue, but I think we'll be O.K.,"" Ms. Moynahan said. ""Have we played golf before?"" Mr. Scheffing wanted to know.

""And then I had a child,"" she continued, referring to Jack, her son by the New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, with whom she was in a relationship from 2004 to 2006. ""And then I had no time to play golf. Who can carve out time in their day to play even nine holes, let alone 18?"" Now Ms. Moynahan's son is turning 12, and he has taken up the game. Her husband of three years, Andrew Frankel, a businessman, plays. Her three stepsons play. ""The last couple of family trips we went on, everybody went out to play golf and I did not,"" Ms. Moynahan said. ""So it's time for me to get back into it. So this is me making a commitment. But I'm scared."" She was generally able to make contact with the ball, she told Mr. Scheffing. ""But I feel I never understand how to create the direction."" ""Yes, control the direction,"" Ms. Moynahan said. ""The last time I played, I was using the driver, and the ball kept going to the right. I would love to get it to go more straight."" Mr. Scheffing reached into a bag of clubs and handed Ms. Moynahan an iron (shorter and easier to control than a driver) for some warm-up swings. ""This will give you a better understanding of how to strike with the club face,"" he said. She nodded, holding the iron aloft and doing some side stretches before getting down to business.

""Yes,"" Mr. Scheffing said. ""No. 1 goal: hit it. No. 2 goal: get it in the air. Let's do one more and then we're going to talk about it."" On his phone he showed Ms. Moynahan the videos he had taken of her swing, and murmured some guidance about proper sequencing -- lead with the hips followed by the torso, then the arms, then the club. She nodded attentively, taking a few practice swings to demonstrate her comprehension. ""We're looking for more of a trophy finish,"" Mr. Scheffing told her. ""All the weight on the outside of the left heel over the left leg.""

""Lovely, I like that shot a lot,"" Mr. Scheffing said as one ball soared. ""When you make solid contact, you're hitting it 115, 120 yards. That's a good thing."" ""So I'm ready to join the pro tour?"" Ms. Moynahan said, then scolded herself over the next several shots. This one was a little choppy. On another one she was swinging her club like a baseball bat. ""Oh, that one was tense,"" she said. Consistency eluded her. ""Don't be so hard on yourself,"" Mr. Scheffing said. ""Jack Nicklaus said if golf were only 12 holes it would be a lot more enjoyable."" Ms. Moynahan nodded. ""When I'm playing,"" she said, ""I always wish there was a nachos stand like around the sixth hole.""","The actress and co-author of ""Our Shoes, Our Selves"" teed up at Chelsea Piers.",037ad359-d30d-516f-b2c8-cd1d7ce87c06,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/02/fashion/00ENCOUNTERS-MOYNAHAN-2/00ENCOUNTERS-MOYNAHAN-2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=c0f71ffd897db6ac54f0ee5fc7157c71449d984db892f757918741f1d3efb28b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A portrait of Bridget Moynahan, one of the stars of the CBS police drama, ""Blue Bloods.""",037ad359-d30d-516f-b2c8-cd1d7ce87c06,N24News/imgs/037ad359-d30d-516f-b2c8-cd1d7ce87c06.jpg,15
Global Business,Players in a Greek Drama,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/23/business/global/in-the-debt-drama-ratings-agencies-play-starring-role.html,"This summer, David Riley is one of the world's most powerful financial analysts. Not only does he have the power to effectively put a ""sell"" on Uncle Sam, but on Friday he roiled global markets after he said the Greek rescue package would constitute a limited default on the country's debt. The analyst, who is based in London, oversees the 30-person government bonds team inside Fitch Ratings, which could soon downgrade the debt of the United States government from its historical, gold-plated, triple-A rating if politicians in Washington cannot agree to raise the debt limit. And after two days of whirlwind conference calls with colleagues in London and New York to weigh what the Greek restructuring proposals might look like and how Fitch would respond, Mr. Riley and his team stamped a ""restricted default"" on Greece Friday morning. The details of the $157 billion bailout plan were announced Thursday by European leaders. The reverberations of a downgrade by Fitch or its competitors, Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, often send borrowing costs soaring for the affected governments while typically putting equity and debt markets into a tailspin as investors run for cover.

That power and responsibility has made Mr. Riley and his team figures -- and often targets for critics -- in the debt drama sweeping the globe this year. ""People don't know who is selling Italian bonds or who is going short Spanish securities or who is betting on a Greek default,"" Mr. Riley said in an interview. ""But a headline that says 'Greece downgraded' is a simple one to understand and you can point the finger at who did it very easily."" His team recently received hostile e-mails labeling them ""idiots"" or blaming them for the harsh austerity measures many European countries have adopted. He is on the speed dial of European policy makers and United States Treasury Department officials who are eager to convince him that their belt-tightening plans are sufficient to avoid a negative report. His days are filled with calls from managers of pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies and other asset managers trying to gauge what might spur a downgrade or a default and how that would affect their holdings of that country's bonds.

Some of the agencies' harshest critics, however, wonder why the rating agencies still wield so much power. Are they acting like disinterested parties in the American debt-ceiling talks or driving the discussions and their own agendas through their demands, they ask. Standard & Poor's, for instance, has said that if any debt-ceiling deal did not include an agreement to reduce the nation's deficit by $4 trillion over the next decade, the United States was still at risk of losing its triple-A rating. ""No nation, agency or organization has the authority to dictate terms to the United States government,"" Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, Democrat of Ohio, said in mid-July after Moody's placed the United States on review for possible downgrade. ""Moody's and its compatriot S.& P. were the direct cause of the near-collapse of the economy of the United States."" Mr. Kucinich and others place significant blame on the rating agencies and their conflict-ridden business models -- they are paid by the issuers they rate -- for much of the financial crisis around mortgage-related securities. The agencies put gold-standard ratings on mortgage-related securities that held increasingly risky home loans while raking in fees from Wall Street banks. Investors bought those securities on the belief that the triple-A rating made them as safe as United States Treasuries. Others, however, say the agencies may simply be forcing governments, including the United States, to take some strong medicine. ""They do see their job as looking down the road"" in asking that whatever debt deal is struck that it addresses the huge United States deficit, said Cornelius Hurley, director of the Boston University Center for Finance, Law and Policy. Mr. Riley, a 45-year-old Briton and father of two, has spent the last decade inside Fitch evaluating governments around the world. He worked as a senior economist at UBS Warburg and, before that was an adviser inside Britain's Treasury department.

To relieve some of the pressure, Mr. Riley says he tries to play with Fitch's soccer team at lunchtime on Tuesdays and that he occasionally plays PlayStation games with his 17-year-old son. David Riley of Fitch oversees the government bonds team inside Fitch Ratings, which could soon downgrade the debt of the United States' government. He says he and his team at Fitch have developed thick skins to deal with the pressure. ""We know that we're under considerable scrutiny and we want to make sure we respond and do the best possible job that we can,"" he said. ""We're doing the work and the analysis, double-checking it and making sure we have our numbers right."" He also doesn't view the jockeying being done by global policy makers as lobbying or overt efforts to influence his decision about a country's ratings. ""It's important if we're trying to provide an informed rating and commentary that we understand what policy makers are trying to achieve and what their plans are,"" Mr. Riley said. He added that he had had to tell global leaders this year that their region's ratings were being downgraded. ""That's something that's never welcomed,"" Mr. Riley said. This year Fitch downgraded the government creditworthiness of Greece, Portugal and Spain. It has Ireland on a ""negative outlook"" but has reaffirmed France's and Italy's status. Mr. Riley started to turn more attention to the American debt ceiling after the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, sent a letter to Congress on May 16 alerting members that the country had reached its statutory debt limit and that measures had been taken to provide cash for the summer. The government has until Aug. 2 to raise the $14.3 trillion debt ceiling or risk not being able to make certain payments on its debt. On June 8, Fitch published a report titled: ""Thinking the Unthinkable -- What if the Debt Ceiling Was Not Increased and the U.S. Defaulted?"" The report said if the cap was not raised in time, Fitch would likely put the United States on ""rating watch negative."" If a payment were missed on a Treasury security, the rating on that security could tumble from triple A to B+, the agency warned.","The power of Fitch, Standard & Poor's or Moody's Investors Service to cut a government's debt rating has given the agencies a pivotal role in the worldwide financial drama.",3b92b3f1-b335-5f4b-b5b5-3e343b4e92ea,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/07/23/business/FITCH/FITCH-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=364&w=600&s=ba878659a88d965496dd17fd7b8e7ad211c82f77fd1942ea12bea30281021153&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Tourists in Athens.

Movies,Jimmy O. Yang's Week: Watching Rom-Coms as 'Homework',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/movies/jimmy-o-yang-favorites.html,"Jimmy O. Yang is already a familiar face in comedy. Many will recognize him as Jian-Yang, the deadpan foil from the HBO satire ""Silicon Valley,"" which ended in 2019 after a six-season run. In ""Crazy Rich Asians,"" he stole scenes as the magnetic playboy Bernard Tai. Since then, he has been on Netflix's ""Space Force,"" opposite Steve Carell and John Malkovich. But until now, he hasn't had a starring role. In his new movie, ""The Opening Act,"" which comes out on Oct. 16, Yang plays Will Chu, a stand-up comedian in Pennsylvania. When Will gets to open for his comedy idol, Billy G., played by Cedric the Entertainer, he realizes he still has a lot to learn about how to make people laugh. The movie, directed by Steve Byrne, has a murderers' row of comedians: Whitney Cummings, Alex Moffat, Russell Peters and Iliza Shlesinger. ""It's really a behind the scenes look of how the sausage is made in the stand-up factory,"" Yang said in a recent interview from Vancouver, Canada. His reverence for comedy is clear. ""The great thing about stand-up is it's such a meritocracy that if you are good, and if you are funny, boom, you get the respect and you're good to go,"" Yang said. ""Whereas acting, you feel like somebody needs to give you an opportunity or the right project has to come along.""

The movie is also nostalgic for him. He saw a lot of parallels between how his own stand-up career started and how the lead character's unfolds. He recalled his first open mic and the immediate camaraderie he shared with the other comics, who gave each other notes afterward. ""On any given night,"" he said, ""you walk in at the improv, and you'll see some of the best of the best comedians out there."" He's been in Vancouver filming the Netflix romantic comedy ""Love Hard,"" directed by Hernan Jimenez. Yang stars as the romantic lead opposite Nina Dobrev; Charles Melton, whom Yang calls the ""stud with a six-pack,"" is his competition. ""The Opening Act"" was filmed within a punishingly dense 19-day shooting schedule and he was in nearly every frame, Yang said. Things were a bit of a blur for him as he adjusted to workdays lasting 10 to 12 hours. Since then, he has committed to getting his sleep schedule right. He also had to approach this role differently. ""With 'Silicon Valley,' I know that character so well; I can go in, and I know how to be funny,"" Yang said. ""Being the lead, it's beyond just being funny. There's a lot more homework, and you have to be mentally prepared."" Yang shared what he has been watching and listening to recently. You won't catch him with a book though. ""I'm not a nerd,"" he said. ""I mean, come on."" (His exception was reading ""Crazy Rich Asians."")

In order to relax, I have to listen and watch stuff that has nothing to do with my life. It's hard sometimes for me to watch a scripted TV show. I've been listening to Howard Stern a lot. I'm a huge fan of him, and I listen in the morning. That's how I relax. It's something completely different from my life. It's four hours and an old school radio show, and sometimes I'll be playing video games or watching a cooking show, or I'll have Howard Stern on while taking a shower. He's just so lovable and very, very funny. He's one of the best interviewers; he just interviewed Chris Rock, and that was incredible. I watched ""About Time."" That's a good one. It's about time traveling as well as being a rom-com. Rachel McAdams is one of my favorite people on the planet. She's so beautiful, talented, lovable and an incredible actor. I was also listening to this podcast that my buddy recommended: ""Business Wars."" It's pretty cool. It's like Netflix versus Blockbuster, Pizza Hut versus Domino's, FedEx versus UPS. I just got into that. I watched ""Notting Hill."" I saw it when I was a kid, and I still remember the soundtrack. My parents would play it. It's such an incredible movie. I would say, not that I'm giving movie reviews here, but Julia Roberts's character -- she's not a great person, she has a lot of flaws -- I feel like she's going to end up breaking Hugh Grant's heart in the future, but the chemistry between those two! It's shot so well and it's written so well that yes, it's a bit of a fairy tale, but I cried when she said her famous line, ""I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy asking him to love her."" I cried. It just makes you feel so warm and fuzzy. It almost makes me want to call a couple of my ex-girlfriends.

I need to watch all the rest of the Richard Curtis movies -- ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" ""Bridget Jones's Diary."" I also need to watch some old school, American rom-coms, like ""The Proposal"" and ""Failure to Launch."" I have a whole list. Before I go to sleep, I always either watch cooking shows, or I watch travel shows on YouTube. So this guy, one of my favorites, his name is Mark Wiens, he's a YouTuber that travels everywhere eating exotic food. That takes me out of being an actor, you know, just seeing like an everyday guy eating and cooking. I'm a huge foodie. ""Chef's Table"" has a barbecue season now. Oh my God. It's incredible. There's ""Taco Chronicles"" -- that's also amazing. My favorite guy on YouTube these days is Gennaro Contaldo, he's on Jamie Oliver's channel. He's this really old Italian man. Amazing. He's so passionate. His dishes are so beautiful, but simple. His videos are usually under five minutes, like the most incredible pasta dishes. I posted a few cooking videos on my own on YouTube as well. I don't make exact recipes. I learn the techniques. Like if you have a couple of pieces of bone-in meat and stuff, you cook it down for two, three hours and make this incredible ragu. I've made spaghetti alle vongole. I remixed it a little bit from what he does, but the basic concept is there. He's incredible; he makes everything look easy.","The comedian is entering new territory as the romantic lead in ""Love Hard.""

Fashion & Style,"Kansai Yamamoto, Designer With Ziggy Stardust as a Client, Dies at 76",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/fashion/kansai-yamamoto-david-bowie-japanese-fashion-designer-dies.html,"Kansai Yamamoto at the Portobello Hotel in London after his debut collection in 1971, a full decade before other, more prominent Japanese designers showed in the city.





Kansai Yamamoto, the unapologetically flamboyant fashion designer whose love of color, unfettered imagination and exploration of genderless dressing caught the eye of David Bowie and helped define the look of his alter ego, Ziggy Stardust, died in a Tokyo hospital on July 21 . He was 76. The cause was leukemia, a statement on his office website confirmed. Kansai, as Mr. Yamamoto was generally known, was not as well-known as some of his more high-profile Japanese fashion contemporaries, including Yohji Yamamoto, Issey Miyake and Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garcons. But it was Kansai who led the way for a generation of Japanese design talents to make their mark on the Western industry. In 1971, he was among the first Japanese designers to show in London -- a full decade before Ms. Kawakubo and the other Mr. Yamamoto. His signature aesthetic of sculptural shapes, clashing textures and prints, and eye-popping color combinations attracted industry attention. Kansai's debut collection was splashed across the cover of Harpers & Queen magazine with the tagline ""Explosion from Tokyo,"" and his growing profile led to collaborations with the decade's most important musician showmen, including Elton John and Stevie Wonder in addition to Mr. Bowie, with whom he formed a longstanding creative relationship.

In a talk at the Brooklyn Museum during its 2018 ""David Bowie Is"" exhibition, to which he wore an elaborate black-and-gold brocade suit that he characterized as ""minimal,"" Kansai recalled meeting Mr. Bowie in 1973. Mr. Bowie's producer had called Kansai and asked him to come to Radio City Music Hall in New York, where, in a concert, Mr. Bowie descended the stage on a giant disco ball. The two men soon discovered that they shared a love of ""radical appearance"" and pushing boundaries. In fact, Mr. Bowie had been wearing Kansai's women's wear since 1971. From 1973 onward, they worked together to create one-off showpieces for Mr. Bowie's stage personas and music tours, including the 1973 ""Aladdin Sane"" tour.

There were exuberant skintight jumpsuits with giant flared hems and silken brocade bomber jackets, androgynous cloaks with cutaways and vivid platform shoes. Often, the costumes incorporated elements from Japanese culture, particularly the silhouette of the kimono and the bold aesthetics of medieval samurai warlords. ""I approached Bowie's clothes as if I was designing for a female,"" Kansai said at the Brooklyn Museum talk, pointing out that there was ""no zipper in front."" He also said that the number of costume changes required had inspired him to use snaps on Mr. Bowie's costumes, so they could be removed faster.

His favorite piece for the singer was the black-and-white jumpsuit with bowed legs featured in the ""David Bowie Is"" exhibition, which was first mounted in 2013 at the Victoria & Albert Museum in London before traveling around the world. ""I found David's aesthetic and interest in transcending gender boundaries shockingly beautiful,"" Kansai told the website The Cut in 2018. Born on Feb. 8, 1944 in Yokohama, on Japan's east coast, Kansai Yamamoto did not have a happy childhood. His parents divorced when he was 7, and he was sent to a children's home. He traveled with his two younger brothers -- ages 3 and 5 -- from Yokohama to Tokyo and then to the far-flung southwestern province of Kochi.

""How much I envied the lights of happy families that I saw from the window of the slow train at dusk,"" he once said. ""It was lonely, and I still can't forget that."" He studied civil engineering before leaving school in 1962 to study English at Nippon University. A self-taught fashion designer (despite saying later that ""fashion is not a profession I would recommend"") he founded his own business, Yamamoto Kansai Company, at 28, the year of his first London show. After his heyday in the 1970s and '80s, and as Japanese fashion gained global prominence for its cultivation of a pared-back minimalism, Kansai continued to explore his interest in traditional Japanese clothing and craftsmanship, but with a distinctive and fantastical flourish. He often pointed to his longstanding affinity with the Japanese concept of basara, a love of color and flamboyance; one that stood directly in contrast with the idea of wabi-sabi, the Buddhist ideal of the beauty in imperfection, modesty and humble materials. Starting in 1993 in Red Square in Moscow, he began producing evermore extravagant ""super shows,"" including one that involved a gigantic inflatable whale.","Unapologetically flamboyant, he shaped the look of David Bowie's alter ego and also worked with Elton John and Stevie Wonder.",f5821881-e21e-5c5e-a2bc-c0ce9550fdd1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/28/obituaries/27Yamamoto8/27Yamamoto8-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=353ae367b36fec8e702c6e751cf29bfae6b6137c5641dc54bbacc990698814eb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Kansai Yamamoto in Beijing in 2012, for a fashion show marking the 40th anniversary of the normalization of Japan-China relations.",f5821881-e21e-5c5e-a2bc-c0ce9550fdd1,N24News/imgs/f5821881-e21e-5c5e-a2bc-c0ce9550fdd1.jpg,19
Style,Dressing to Play a Power Woman,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/17/style/network-michelle-dockery-power-dressing.html,"Michelle Dockery and Douglas Henshall in ""Network,"" at the National Theater in London. The costume designer An D'Huys said she dressed the actress in bright colors to show that her character is ""not a team player.""

LONDON -- In 1977 Sidney Lumet's film ""Network,"" about the struggles of a fictional television group, won four Academy Awards, including a best actress Oscar for Faye Dunaway's portrayal of a producer, Diana Christensen. Morally bankrupt and of ""psychopathic ambition,"" as Vincent Canby said in his review in The New York Times, Ms. Christensen was also perfectly attired in pussy-bow blouses, pencil skirts, knee-high boots and heavy camel coats. Her style helped herald the advent of ""power dressing."" Now, 40 years later, Ms. Christensen and her wardrobe are getting a makeover. The look of the female executive has been redefined on the stage of the National Theater in London, where the Tony Award winner Ivo van Hove is directing Michelle Dockery (""Downton Abbey"") as Ms. Christensen in the first stage adaptation, a ""Network"" for the 21st century. The key ingredients this time around, according to the Belgian costume designer An D'Huys, 53, whose 30-year fashion career has spanned television, movies, opera, dance and theater along with 11 years working with the Antwerp designer Ann Demeulemeester

Bright, clashing colors, strong lines -- and pants. ""The colors show that Diana is not working with the rest of the people and not a team player,"" Ms. D'Huys said. ""It's not a choice of everyone; it's her own choice. And a signal that 'I can wear what I want even if the colors aren't matching together.' "" ""I put Diana in pants, oversized blouses and men's coats,"" she said. ""The most important thing is how a man's cut can be very feminine and very powerful. The silhouette is more modern, closer fitting.""

Prada's recent collections, with their pops of orange, green, red and other bright colors, were an inspiration, according to Ms. Huys, who said Miuccia Prada herself was among the women who served as a model of sorts: ""the kind of woman, like Diana, who is personally powerful and rich, not just a business woman."" It took Ms. D'Huys nine weeks to settle on Ms. Dockery's final looks; of the 20 costumes initially selected and worn during rehearsal, six outfits made the first preview. They created ""the strongest images of Diana,"" said Ms. D'Huys, who found many of the pieces in vintage shops, including the hip Retro Woman in the Notting Hill area of London, and in the National's own costume stores to keep the look within budget -- and believability.

That whittling process helped Ms. Dockery create her character. ""I've never done a play before where are you in costumes from the very first day,"" the actress wrote in an email, ""so I was in character from the start."" Thus platform peep-toe heels were swapped for simple black leather round-toe court shoes from Selfridges, because the first style hurt Ms. Dockery's feet and ""it's important to be comfortable to show strength,"" Ms. D'Huys said. Ms. Dockery agreed, adding that the physical demands of playing an executive in today's media world mean that lower heels are the modern power shoes. ""You can immediately see what works and what doesn't,"" Ms D'Huys said, adding that a Chloe minidress was too girly (army-inspired though it was). The only scene in which Ms. Dockery does wear a dress -- a low-cut, black Diane von Furstenberg wrap with layered satin frills -- is in a steamy restaurant moment with her former colleague and soon-to-be lover, Max Schumacher (played by Douglas Henshall). It made sense, Ms. D'Huys said, because ""it is easy to pull up and with one popper easy to open.""

Along with the flares came assorted silk shirts, including one McQ tie-neck bib-front style that Ms. D'Huys dyed a vivid orange (originally made in cream, the color was too washed-out for Ms. Dockery's complexion), and a bright purple from Diane von Furstenberg. Military-style coats play a significant role, including a belted beige trench with capelike shoulders, and a double-breasted Burberry wool with epaulets and leather detailing on the sleeves. ""Everything is loose fitting and not too styled, so Diana is relaxed,"" wrote Ms. Dockery, noting that not-trying-too-hard was the essence of her character's look. As Ms. Christensen's power fluctuates through the play, so does the vibrancy of her clothes. She makes her entrance in a neutral tobacco-colored honeycomb-print blouse, for example, but dons a luminous yellow shirt when she believes she has hit the ratings jackpot when her increasingly unmoored anchorman Howard Beale (played by Bryan Cranston) delivers his famous live broadcast announcing he is ""mad as hell"" and can't take it any more. Later, as her personal and professional lives go awry (her lover leaves and ratings plummet), more subtle, smudged colors appear in the form of dark green, wide-leg pants bought online from Theory a week before the first preview. ""I wanted another color for the ending as everything goes down,"" Ms. D'Huys said. What Ms. Christensen never has: ""It"" bags or other logo-laden accessories. As to why, well, Ms. D'Huys said, ""most of the people I have met who are very important and powerful don't show labels.""","The National Theater's ""Network"" redefines the wardrobe of the modern media executive.",f62e6d5d-509c-5c1c-b734-562eaa593a75,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/19/fashion/19network-A/19network-A-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=897305197bfdfdc1aad05d280bf1e86f121fa00a4d0feedef44354684513e63f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Michelle Dockery and Douglas Henshall in &ldquo;Network,&rdquo; at the National Theater in London.

Music,Lawsuit Accusing Russell Simmons of Rape Is Dropped,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/arts/music/russell-simmons-rape-lawsuit-dropped.html,"A lawsuit accusing the music mogul Russell Simmons of rape was dropped from federal court in Los Angeles on Wednesday.

The complaint was filed in January by Jennifer Jarosik, 37, who sought $5 million in damages. She said that she had first met Mr. Simmons in 2006 when he had offered to help her produce a documentary. Ms. Jarosik said that Mr. Simmons raped her at his home in Los Angeles in 2016 and that afterward she felt humiliation, fear and depression.

On April 4, Mr. Simmons's legal team submitted an answer in court that strongly denied the accusations, saying that the complaint was ""filled with lies against Mr. Simmons, who has only ever tried to help her.""

The filing claims that the sexual encounter was consensual and alludes to a series of text messages in which Ms. Jarosik expresses affection for Mr. Simmons. It also claims that Ms. Jarosik sent unsolicited nude photos to Mr. Simmons after the date on which she said the rape had occurred.","The suit, filed in January by Jennifer Jarosik, was dropped on Wednesday.

Real Estate,Trash Disposal Needs Design?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/29/realestate/trash-disposal-needs-design.html,"An apartment building's trash disposal system is seldom on its amenities list. Nor are prospective buyers or renters likely to ask about things like garbage or recycling methods. But ""Designing Waste: Strategies for a Zero Waste City,"" an exhibition on the Zero Waste Design Guidelines, on display through Sept. 1 at the Center for Architecture, is about precisely that: the varied and often messy ways that New Yorkers deal with their trash and recycling. The guidelines -- and the exhibit -- are meant to get residents, landlords, building owners, architects and developers focused on the effort to reduce waste and increase recycling. (The guidelines were developed by American Institute of Architects New York; Kiss + Cathcart, Architects; ClosedLoops; and Foodprint Group; with support from the Rockefeller Foundation.) ""There are a bunch of steps that have to happen before waste rolls away,"" said Andrew Blum, curator of the exhibition. ""At each of those steps, there's some kind of design moment, whether it's the chute room in a building, the sorter in a restaurant or office, the person bagging and sorting the waste and if they have room to do it properly, and bringing it out to the curb while making sure it's separated.""

The hope is that focusing on each of these design moments will make for more efficient handling and sorting of waste, from the time residents throw out their trash to when the city picks it up. Some New York City buildings already have inventive solutions, like the Harlem condo that provides valet composting service or the box breakdown station in Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village that makes it easier for residents to collapse their cardboard boxes. Under the city's OneNYC plan, New York aims to reduce the amount of refuse collected by the Department of Sanitation by 90 percent by 2030, from a 2005 baseline. The challenge is clear: ""We only capture 50 percent of the recyclables,"" said Bridget Anderson, deputy commissioner for recycling and sustainability at the Department of Sanitation. ""A large part of why we don't capture more of the recycling is design, and the fact that it's not convenient to recycle in many buildings.""

Of the roughly 12,000 tons of trash the sanitation department collects every day from homes and institutions (commercial waste is collected by private haulers), only about 2,000 are diverted for recycling. A small amount of organic material suitable for composting -- 100 tons or so -- is also diverted from landfills, although organic material represents about a third of all waste collected by the city. The rest is treated as refuse. In search of best practices, the authors of the design guidelines followed the waste trail through more than 40 buildings, from the service corridors of prewar co-ops to the triple chutes (for refuse; paper; and metal, glass and plastic) of newer towers.

""It was eye-opening,"" said Clare Miflin, one of the authors, who worked at Kiss + Cathcart when the guidelines were developed, and now runs the design consulting company Woven. They found trash rooms bursting with cardboard, elevators and exits blocked by bags of recycling, trash chutes with pest problems, circuitous routes from trash storage to curb, sidewalks piled with mountains of garbage bags and ad hoc procedures that created friction at every turn. Because the flow of waste is often treated as a low-priority item in the design of new buildings, and older buildings were never constructed to handle recycling, building employees are often left to figure things out for themselves. Nevertheless, the authors found shining examples buried in the muck. ""In places where they have thought about waste, it's inspiring,"" Ms. Miflin said. ""In some buildings, there's amazing creativity at every level."" One of those places is Strivers Gardens, a 170-unit condominium at 300 West 135th Street built in 2005, where Martin Robertson, the facilities manager, hopes to make waste disposal as painless as possible for residents, while maximizing participation in recycling. After arriving at the building in 2013, and with the support of the board, Mr. Robertson introduced textile and electronic waste recycling containers in the basement in 2015, and an organics collection program in 2016. Residents can buy a countertop stainless-steel compost bin with a charcoal filter from the building for $35 and use a valet service to have it emptied by staff as often as needed. (Residents can also empty any type of bin in basement collection containers themselves.)

""You can leave it at the front desk when you leave for work,"" Mr. Robertson said. ""We'll empty it, wash it out and leave it for you to pick up when you come back in."" Diverting some of the building's organic waste has allowed management to cut the frequency of trash chute cleanings in half, Mr. Robertson said, and helps keep compactor rooms odor free. When residents leave large boxes in the trash rooms on individual floors that interfere with other people accessing recycling bins, they receive a written reminder of the building's policies and, if the behavior continues, are fined. Each compactor bag is also labeled with the initials of the employee who prepared it, so any problems can be addressed. ""It's to support the future of our planet,"" Mr. Robertson said. ""We're trendsetters in New York. We do set the example, so I definitely want to be part of it."" At Stuy Town, building employees have experimented with various methods of encouraging the development's approximately 30,000 residents to recycle more, under the leadership of Rei Moya, the resident manager. To encourage residents to use an organics collection program that was started in 2016, the development gives residents individual countertop compost bins with compostable bags that can be dropped in sanitation department collection bins in the basement recycling center of each building. (The buckets and bags are distributed for free at the Stuy Town Greenmarket on Sundays.) ""We learned that you have to make it convenient and easy,"" said Steven Gregware, the director of environmental services, who estimated that Stuy Town now diverts about 20 percent of its organic waste, or about five tons a week, from refuse.",A new exhibition looks at how buildings can make recycling easier.,61958886-072c-5720-87f9-d1ba83df30e9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/01/realestate/01trash1/merlin_140259807_dda257b9-0864-4b42-a7f4-f95f0d31ae7a-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=85821ad013a1e246dab1a3a7806115fb6af4501d0ef716d07bc3c4d720773cd1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""Designing Waste: Strategies for a Zero Waste City,"" at the Center for Architecture in New York, focuses on making it easier to recycle.",61958886-072c-5720-87f9-d1ba83df30e9,N24News/imgs/61958886-072c-5720-87f9-d1ba83df30e9.jpg,7
Health,Your Coronavirus Antibodies Are Disappearing. Should You Care?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/health/coronvirus-antibody-tests.html,"Your blood carries the memory of every pathogen you've ever encountered. If you've been infected with the coronavirus, your body most likely remembers that, too. Antibodies are the legacy of that encounter. Why, then, have so many people stricken by the virus discovered that they don't seem to have antibodies? Most commercial antibody tests offer crude yes-no answers. The tests are notorious for delivering false positives -- results indicating that someone has antibodies when he or she does not. But the volume of coronavirus antibodies drops sharply once the acute illness ends. Now it is increasingly clear that these tests may also produce false-negative results, missing antibodies to the coronavirus that are present at low levels.

Moreover, some tests -- including those made by Abbott and Roche and offered by Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp -- are designed to detect a subtype of antibodies that doesn't confer immunity and may wane even faster than the kind that can destroy the virus. What that means is that declining antibodies, as shown by commercial tests, don't necessarily mean declining immunity, several experts said. Long-term surveys of antibodies, intended to assess how widely the coronavirus has spread, may also underestimate the true prevalence. ""We're learning a lot about how antibodies change over time,"" said Dr. Fiona Havers, a medical epidemiologist who has led such surveys for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If the narrative on immunity to the coronavirus has seemed to shift constantly, it's in part because the virus was a stranger to scientists. But it's increasingly clear that this virus behaves much like any other. This is how immunity to viruses generally works: The initial encounter with a pathogen -- typically in childhood -- surprises the body. The resulting illness can be mild or severe, depending on the dose of the virus and the child's health, access to health care and genetics.

A mild illness may trigger production of only a few antibodies, and a severe one many more. The vast majority of people who become infected with the coronavirus have few to no symptoms, many experts believe, and those people may produce a milder immune response. But even a minor infection is often enough to teach the body to recognize the intruder. After the battle ends, balloon-like cells that live in the bone marrow steadily pump out a small number of specialized assassins. The next time -- and every time after that -- that the body comes across the virus, those cells can mass-produce antibodies within hours. The mnemonic response grows stronger with every encounter. It's one of the great miracles of the human body. ""Whatever your level is today, if you get infected, your antibody titers are going to go way up,"" said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University, referring to the levels of antibodies in the blood. ""The virus will never even have a chance the second time around."" A single drop of blood contains billions of antibodies, all lying in wait for their specific targets. Sometimes, as may be the case for antibodies to the coronavirus, there are too few to get a positive signal on a test -- but that does not mean the person tested has no immunity to the virus. ""Even if their antibodies wane below the limits of detection of our instruments, it doesn't mean their 'memory' is gone,"" Dr. Mina said. A small number of people may not produce any antibodies to the coronavirus. But even in that unlikely event, they will have so-called cellular immunity, which includes T cells that learn to identify and destroy the virus. Virtually everyone infected with the coronavirus seems to develop T-cell responses, according to several recent studies.

""This means that even if the antibody titer is low, those people who are previously infected may have a good enough T-cell response that can provide protection,"" said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University.
* Austria braces for violence at mass protests over Covid measures.
* In Europe, again the pandemic's epicenter, new restrictions provoke resistance.
* The dance floor is packed, but New York City clubs are still in debt. T cells are harder to detect and to study, however, so when it comes to immunity, antibodies have received all of the attention. The coronavirus carries several antigens -- proteins or pieces of a protein -- that can provoke the body into producing antibodies. The most powerful antibodies recognize a piece of the coronavirus's spike protein, the receptor binding domain, or R.B.D. That is the part of the virus that docks onto human cells. Antibodies that recognize the R.B.D. can neutralize the virus and prevent infection. But the Roche and Abbott tests that are now widely available -- and several others authorized by the Food and Drug Administration -- instead look for antibodies to a protein called the nucleocapsid, or N, that is bound up with the virus's genetic material. Some scientists were stunned to hear of this choice. ""God, I did not realize that -- that's crazy,"" said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York. ""It's kind of puzzling to design a test that's not looking for what's thought to be the major antigen."" The N protein is plentiful in the blood, and testing for antibodies to it produces a swifter, brighter signal than testing for antibodies to the spike protein. Because antibody tests are used to detect past infection, however, manufacturers are not required to prove that the antibodies their tests seek are those that actually confer protection against the virus. Officials at the Food and Drug Administration did not respond to requests for comment on whether the two tests target the appropriate antibodies.

There's another wrinkle to the story. Some reports now suggest that antibodies to the viral nucleocapsid may decline faster than those to R.B.D. or to the entire spike -- the really effective ones. ""The majority of people are getting tested for anti-N antibody, which does tend to wane more rapidly -- and so, you know, it may be not the most suitable test for looking at neutralizing capacity,"" Dr. Iwasaki said. In the United States, millions of people have taken the Roche and Abbott tests. LabCorp alone has performed more than two million antibody tests made by the two manufacturers. Quest relies on tests made by Abbott, Ortho Clinical and Euroimmun. Quest declined to reveal what proportion of the 2.7 million tests it has deployed so far were made by Abbott. Dr. Jonathan Berz, a physician in Boston, tested positive for the virus in early April but felt fine, apart from a sore throat. His wife was sicker, and despite several negative diagnostic tests, she remained ill for weeks. ""Initially, we felt as a family that, 'Oh wow, we got sick, unfortunately,'"" Dr. Berz said. ""'But the good side of that is that we're going to have immunity.'"" In early June, the couple and their two children took Abbott antibody tests processed by Quest. All four turned up negative. Even though Dr. Berz knew that immunity is complex and that T cells also play a role, he was disappointed.

As a doctor in a Covid-19 clinic, he had always acted as though he was at risk for infection. But after seeing the antibody results, he said, ""my level of anxiety just increased."" A spokeswoman at Abbott said the test had 100 percent sensitivity 17 days after symptoms began but did not provide information about sensitivity beyond that time. Dr. Beatus Ofenloch-Haehnle, who heads immunoassay research at Roche, defended the company's antibody test. His team has tracked N antibodies in 130 people who had mild to no symptoms and has not yet seen a decline, he said. ""There is some fluctuation, but no waning at all,"" he said. ""We have a lot of data, and we do not rely anymore on theory."" The N antibody can be a decent proxy for immunity, Dr. Ofenloch-Haehnle added. He also pointed to a study by Public Health England that suggested that the Abbott and Roche tests seemed to perform well up to 73 days after symptom onset. ""I think we should be careful to jump to conclusions too soon,"" he said. Other experts also urged caution. Without more information about what antibody testing results mean, they said, people should do as Dr. Berz did: Act as though they do not have immunity. There is no definitive information as yet on what levels of antibodies are needed for immunity or how long that protection might last. ""I think we're getting closer and closer to that knowledge,"" Dr. Iwasaki said.","Declining antibody levels do not mean less immunity, experts say. Besides, two widely used tests may detect the wrong antibodies.",c845fd40-1ddf-5718-aefd-106dedc8fed4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/26/us/politics/26virus-antibodies/merlin_174661485_e2c83e91-d733-4091-8cb8-ad86bbc8fd6a-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=ba933ac4465d4d806eac829ed6f41ffe1f1b4db6a2086bf42d775383b052ec4f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A pharmacist administering a test for coronavirus antibodies in France last week.,c845fd40-1ddf-5718-aefd-106dedc8fed4,N24News/imgs/c845fd40-1ddf-5718-aefd-106dedc8fed4.jpg,1
Fashion & Style,Milan Is Still Making It New,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/fashion/milan-mens-fashion-week-review.html,"MILAN -- Despite its reputation for being predictable, safe, conservative, sometimes boring -- the Philadelphia of fashion -- Milan still has the power to surprise. Especially during a time when the clothing industry in general is scrambling to adjust to the new exigencies of a fragmented marketplace, the continued decline of bricks-and-mortar retailing and the insuperable challenges of pinning down the fickle tastes of that generational behemoth called the Millennial, it is worth tuning in to the fashion frequencies transmitted from this northern industrial city. Giorgio Armani showed suits, for instance, proper suits and not just once but twice, first at Emporio Armani and then at the Giorgio Armani show. Those shows bracketed an intensely compressed 72-hour period that now constitutes men's fashion week here.

Showing a suit at a men's wear presentation may not seem like a radical proposition until you remember that the suit has become the Uncle Bernie of fashion, a corpse propped up in the back seat of the convertible and driven around town. Mr. Armani seemed this week to be making a bet that there is life left in a uniform that, in its constituent parts, has managed to last at least 300 years.

That he chose, in the middle of shows chockablock with perhaps overfamiliar design elements -- velvet trousers, asymmetrical zippers, cropped knit sports jackets, woven or stamped patterns resembling Hokusai clouds, palettes restricted to muted grays, deep blues and black -- to present nattily tailored double-breasted suits in six buttons (Emporio Armani) and eight buttons (Giorgio Armani) suggests a belief that the long-term legacy of casual Fridays may, perversely, turn out to be formal Fridays. The suit is dead. Long live the suit. Other designers here took trips down memory lane. The most pleasurable to see was Miuccia Prada, who recast the black Pocone nylon on which she first made her reputation in the 1980s as big, boxy and covetable outerwear. In those long-ago days, carrying a sleek Prada backpack was a surefire tell that the wearer was in the know. Editors actually fought over the bags, which were not, truth to tell, all that much to look at.

Donatella Versace also kept her eye on the rearview mirror, mentally rummaging through the motifs of a design house created in the '80s by her brother, looking for elements to recast for a social media age. It made sense because in many ways Versace was the quintessential Instagram label avant la lettre. Here, she invoked the whole canonical Versace shebang as if intentionally for an iPhone cascade. There were neo-Roman ""Amore e Psiche"" and ""Sipario"" housewares prints. There was the garishly gilded Leonard's of Great Neck palette. There was, as always, exuberant styling, pairing kilts with thigh-high boots, adding caterpillar fringe to hoodies, sticking on logo pins, deploying Versace tartans and adding interlocking chains to the soles of a new molded sneaker introduced for an audience that notably included the hip-hop artist Tauheed Epps.

Mr. Epps is better known as 2 Chainz or Tity Boi, and that he was one of the few celebrities to be spotted here this season suggests either steep reductions in designer budgets or a certain level of fame fatigue. True, there were obligatory Hadid and Jenner sightings on the runway of Dsquared, where Bella Hadid opened and Kendall Jenner closed a show that had a rhinestone-cowboy theme that felt somehow halfhearted, lacking the crazed exuberance of the wonderfully gaudy stuff once devised for country music greats like Hank Williams, Johnny Cash and Gene Autry (and Elvis and Cher) by the inimitable Nudie Cohn.

In truth, the flesh-and-blood Ms. Jenner declined to grace the dinner with her attendance, though she had briefly ventured into the mosh pit of a press preview at the Villa Necchi Campiglio, the magnificent modernist villa where Tod's is privileged to stage its presentations. Perhaps, as one American editor somewhat cynically suggested, Ms. Jenner's fee scale for appearances does not include lifting a fork. Or maybe she just doesn't care for baked sea bass with artichokes or cannot afford the calories in il Baretto's famous, and famously fattening, saffron risotto, a large plate of which Mr. Bolle devoured with gusto. ""I danced last night, so I'm hungry,"" said Mr. Bolle, who, the evening before, had starred onstage at La Scala in ""La Dame aux Camelias."" ""There's a lot of lifting,"" he said.

The week here concluded with a different sort of lifting, as the models at the delightful Fendi show grabbed luggage off a baggage carousel specially constructed for a witty set resembling an airport arrivals hall. Like others in Milan, the designer Silvia Venturini Fendi seemed mentally to be straddling two zones, both looking back at the storied heritage of her family company -- founded in the 1920s in Rome to sell umbrellas and luggage -- for design elements as traditional as a parasol hat and forward to futuristic technology that allows her now to create fur and rubber garments bonded with no need for stitching.

The past is the future, Ms. Fendi said backstage before the show. And, just as it is undoubtedly true that in few other places besides Italy do successive eras remain in such active dialogue, in few other pursuits outside fashion is temporality so intrinsic to the creative process. Consider Rocco Iannone's debut show for Pal Zileri, a respectable midrange Italian label acquired some years back by Mayhoola for Investments with the intention of making it a player on a par with the other companies (Balmain, Valentino) run by an investment arm of the royal family of Qatar. After the departure last year of Mauro Ravizza Krieger, the creative director of Pal Zileri, Mayhoola recruited Mr. Iannone, 33, from the ranks of Giorgio Armani's design team, where he had worked for the last decade, most recently as senior men's wear designer. What he brought to his new job, along with the design chops evident in the exquisitely tailored coats he showed, was a sense, as some press notes made clear, of the ""cyclical nature of history"" in fashion and just about everything else.

Yet, for all that, a bit of unintentional leavening did occur. Placed on each cushioned seat at the show was a pack of cards depicting portraits of male ancients, each associated with some trait characteristic of a true gentleman. It could be that something was lost in translating to English the Italian legends accompanying cards for Precision, Kindness, Gravitas and other traits. Or else this observer had not drunk enough coffee that day. ""Ci Sono, dunque"" (""I am here, therefore I am""), read one card marked Awareness. On another, signifying Nonchalance, were printed the words ""Mi dimentico, mentre lo faccio,"" which was translated as ""I forget about it while I'm doing it."" Come to think of it, that one did make a certain kind of sense. Sometimes I forget about it while I'm doing it, too.","Giorgio Armani, Prada and Fendi proved that men's fashion has the power to surprise.",4d97c892-5494-54f7-a019-cb73533a140a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/18/fashion/18FENDI1/18FENDI1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=346f88e7348fc5724b079fe7340ce170fc628dc0fb6b317242bbe77f1e1f274b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The designer Silvia Venturini Fendi seemed to straddle time zones in her Milan fashion show, above, including traditional elements like a parasol hat and futuristic touches like garments bonded with no need for stitching.",4d97c892-5494-54f7-a019-cb73533a140a,N24News/imgs/4d97c892-5494-54f7-a019-cb73533a140a.jpg,19
Style,'Total Bellas' Refuse to Be Knocked Out by Quarantine,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/20/style/total-bellas-wwe-divas-nikki-brie.html,"When Nikki and Brie Bella, twin sisters who are also reality stars and recently retired WWE champions, found out they were both pregnant last November, they were most excited about the pizookies. While working as professional athletes, pizookies -- cookies baked in a cast iron pan like a pizza, of course -- were off limits. For more than a decade, both sisters regularly traveled 300 days a year, performing acrobatics five nights a week before a live audience in fights that, though scripted, required intense daily workouts and strict diets. ""I have not had a pizookie, I feel like, in 10 or more years, because I'd have to get in wrestling gear,"" Nikki said. ""Finally it's allowed."" Neither woman had considered that they might spend their pregnancies isolated, trying to film their show ""Total Bellas,"" which airs on E!, from their homes in a gated community in Phoenix, Ariz., during a pandemic. Let alone without professional-grade pizookies from Oregano's, a local restaurant chain.

A skeleton film crew has been living nearby, in Airbnb rentals. Its members are required to wear masks on set at all times, have their temperatures checked multiple times a day and maintain proper social distance from behind the camera. Though filming largely wrapped at the beginning of July, at least two crew members will remain in Arizona, apart from their own families, as they wait for both Bella babies to be born. (Outside cameras are banned from the delivery room, so any footage will be taken by the twins' partners.) Conveniently, the twins live next door to one another. Nikki's fiance is the ""Dancing with the Stars"" pro Artem Chigvintsev, and Brie's husband is Daniel Bryan, a WWE heavyweight champion.

Now, when Nikki has an uncontrollable pregnancy craving for pizookies (homemade, alas), Brie provides the means of production for Artem, the baker. ""Tell Artem I have a skillet,"" Brie said to Nikki, on a Zoom conference call with both twins from their respective homes. ""If he makes us pizookie, I will,"" -- and here, she paused -- ""freak out."" Of their living arrangement, Nikki said: ""There's no boundaries."" (She conceived her child in her sister's home, she offered as example.) There is ""zero property line"" between their homes, Brie said. For early morning coffee, ""I literally just walk over, the majority of the time in my robe and slippers, just walk into Brie's,"" said Nikki. ""If she's cooking food, I guess I have the expectation that there's some for me."" ""We feel we have a mini-compound,"" Brie added. ""We don't ever feel alone.""

In 2005, they moved to Los Angeles to start auditioning for TV and modeling gigs. Brie worked part-time as a server at the Mondrian Hotel on Sunset. They got a callback from the WWE in 2007 and made their ""Smackdown"" debuts a year later, with a script written by the actor and WWE superfan Freddie Prinze Jr. The maneuver he helped design, called ""Twin Magic,"" was a sort of ""Parent Trap""-style swap, with the women trading spots under the stage whenever one needed a breather. The audience was at first oblivious to the trick. Nikki performed for almost two months as Brie before she was officially introduced, and for the next decade, the twins dominated the franchise as a tag team. They were cast in ""Total Divas,"" a reality show on E!, in 2013. ""Total Bellas,"" a spinoff, began in 2016. The shows have intimately chronicled the twins' lives, including Nikki's six-year relationship, on-air engagement to and subsequent breakup from the former wrestler and actor John Cena, and Brie's ups and downs with her husband, Mr. Bryan. Last year, both sisters joined Mr. Bryan in retirement, citing the birth of Brie's daughter, Birdie, 3, and Nikki's string of injuries including a broken neck, herniated disc and brain cysts that she suspected were caused by her signature ring move, the ""Rack Attack,"" during which Nikki would lift opponents atop her shoulders and slam down onto her knees, dropping them to the floor behind her. (Professional wrestling is remarkably dangerous for its practitioners, who are often independent contractors even if they are exclusive to the WWE.) The twins had been scheduled for induction into the WWE Hall of Fame in April, but the ceremony was postponed because of the coronavirus. Their legacy, however, remains: The Bellas helped usher in a more female-focused era of the WWE, with the Divas Championship, which started in 2008 (and has since been renamed the WWE Womens' Championship) getting more airtime over the course of their run.

Keeping Up With the Kardashians Filming on ""Total Bellas,"" which is produced by the reality juggernaut Bunim/Murray, had just started in ""little bites and pieces,"" according to the twins, when the coronavirus began to spread, shutting down production for five weeks while the principals regrouped. In early May, after ratifying a new list of safety protocols, it became one of the first Bunim/Murray Productions reality shows -- which include ""Project Runway,"" ""The Real World,"" ""Lindsay Lohan's Beach Club,"" and ""Keeping up with the Kardashians"" -- to resume production in the pandemic, a decision made more urgent by the twins' impending due dates. In pre-Covid times, said Farnaz Farjam, the show's executive producer, there might have been as many as 16 people present for filming at a given location. ""Total Bellas"" is now getting by with a maximum of six. Still, it's a contrast to the scene over at ""Keeping up with the Kardashians,"" which is also executive produced by Ms. Farjam. Faced with the choice of either shutting down or switching to entirely self-filmed episodes, the Kardashian family members chose to produce hours of footage themselves, using iPhones that are collected each week by a masked showrunner and dropped off at the production offices.

""With Kardashians, we kind of had to resort to self-shooting, just because the city restrictions were so different,"" Ms. Farjam said. ""In Arizona, we were allowed to film, but to keep everybody safe, we basically cut our team in half."" Having even a pared-down crew is preferable to no crew at all, she acknowledged. ""You guys are going to get to see the self-shot stuff with the Kardashians when it comes out, and you're going to notice the difference. It's still so entertaining and so compelling, and I'm so excited for it,"" Ms. Farjam said. ""But I think there's an art behind the way a producer and camera operators capture storytelling that people self-shooting can't always do."" The Bella twins, who do not wear masks while filming, have felt protected but somewhat disconcerted. ""It's a different feeling this season than I've ever felt before, because we can't be close,"" Brie said. Though Brie's husband still has to travel occasionally for work, the families have been limiting their exposure to anyone else who hasn't self-isolated for two weeks. That means the Bellas have had to do almost all of their own hair and makeup this season. They are convinced that viewers will be able to pinpoint the moment their quarantined longtime makeup artist returns to set. By the finale of the season, ""you'll see the Bellas in good glam,"" Brie said. ""But there's still no hair,"" Nikki said.

""Yeah, still no hair,"" Brie said. Demand for hair styling services in Arizona, where infection rates skyrocketed following the state's early reopening, had been so high that the twins decided to just wing it themselves. ""All of our friends who are hairstylists, they're slammed here. Having their busiest weeks,"" Nikki said. ""Everyone else is already working again, and to ask someone to quarantine and then just be a part of us, they'd be missing out on so much business. Because we've thought about that. We're like, 'Let's just make people around us quarantine.' Everyone's like, 'No, no. We have to work.'"" Both sisters also said they are thinking more critically about workers' protections and the morals they're bringing to their own companies, which include a clothing line, makeup line and a wine brand. ""Everyone's seen the shift in the world and whether you want to accept it or not, when you do accept it, it's nice to go with the shift and just evolve, because I feel if you don't evolve with whatever's going on right now and what the future may bring, then you're going to be left out in the dust,"" Brie said. ""I do believe we have a new normal. It's crazy because I feel our generations never saw that, but our grandparents saw it. They knew what it was like to go through war, the Great Depression. They had to shift. They had to evolve. And I feel like that's what we're all going to have to do too.""",The twin reality stars and retired WWE champions Nikki and Brie Bella are both pregnant and making TV.,733c64e5-0e61-5e10-ae9a-15d151b46c2e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/23/fashion/17totalbellas2/17totalbellas2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=bd8aabb979f1898f39b0b531013045fc8fd9a30176cef78f836810771fa25aa0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Nikki and Brie Bella, at home in Phoenix.",733c64e5-0e61-5e10-ae9a-15d151b46c2e,N24News/imgs/733c64e5-0e61-5e10-ae9a-15d151b46c2e.jpg,15
Science,First All-Female Spacewalk Canceled Because NASA Doesn't Have Two Suits That Fit,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/science/female-spacewalk-canceled.html,"First All-Female Spacewalk Canceled Because NASA Doesn't Have Two Suits That Fit

It hadn't been planned as a historic mission, yet it would have represented a moment of sorts: the first all-female spacewalk. But that moment will have to wait, NASA said Monday, because of a somewhat basic issue -- spacesuit sizes. The two astronauts who were scheduled to walk together in space on Friday, Anne C. McClain and Christina H. Koch, would both need to wear a medium-size torso component. But only one is readily available at the International Space Station.

[Read about the Trump administration's pledge to return to the moon within 5 years.] The mission itself is unchanged. On Friday, two astronauts will venture outside of the space station on a six-hour mission to install massive lithium-ion batteries that will help to power the research laboratory. Ms. Koch is still scheduled to participate, along with her fellow astronaut Nick Hague; Ms. McClain did her first spacewalk last week.

But the first women-only venture outside of the confines of the space station will have to happen on another day. ""After consulting with McClain and Hague following the first spacewalk, mission managers decided to adjust the assignments, due in part to spacesuit availability on the station,"" NASA said in a statement. Stephanie Schierholz, a spokeswoman for NASA, said in an interview on Monday that there were already two medium-size hard upper torsos -- ""essentially the shirt of the spacesuit,"" according to NASA -- at the space station. But there were a couple of issues. One was that Ms. McClain had thought she would be able to work in a large-size torso, but after her spacewalk last Friday, she wore a medium-size torso and learned that it fit her better. Ms. Koch also uses the same size. And of the two medium-size torsos available, one has yet to be properly configured for a spacewalk. It would take hours of crew labor -- not to mention some additional risk -- to fix that in time for Friday. Instead of doing that, NASA decided to simply switch out the astronauts.

In the end, both women will have done a spacewalk -- just not together. ""When you have the option of just switching the people, the mission becomes more important than a cool milestone,"" Ms. Schierholz said. [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] On Friday, Ms. Koch and Mr. Hague will be supported by a team on the ground that includes a number of women in key positions, including the spacewalk's flight director, Mary Lawrence, and its lead officer, Jackie Kagey. In a briefing at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston this month, Ms. Lawrence, Ms. Kagey and Kenneth Todd, the station's operations integration manager, said officials had not immediately recognized the significance of the original lineup for Friday's ""extravehicular activity,"" or EVA. It was only as they discussed the schedule during a meeting that they realized it was the first time they had scheduled an all-female spacewalk.

""We're sort of getting to the point of inevitability,"" Ms. Schierholz said of an all-female EVA. Ms. McClain and Ms. Koch were part of the 2013 astronaut class, and of the eight people in that class -- chosen from more than 6,000 applicants -- half were women, a first for NASA. The agency lists 38 active astronauts on its website, and 12 are women. The current roster of six astronauts at the space station -- three Americans, one Canadian and two Russians -- allows the team to carry out a number of important projects, with an eye toward making sure each crew member accumulates significant experience, Mr. Todd said. NASA officials hope the relatively young American astronauts will continue to travel to space in the coming years and assist new recruits in the future. The batteries being installed on this mission store solar power that the station needs when it is not in direct sunlight. Work on the battery systems will continue for the next few years as international teams bring more lithium-ion batteries to the station, which is more than 200 miles from Earth. The missions require meticulous planning, and robots do as much of the work as possible before astronauts take the risk of venturing into space. In the busy days ahead of a spacewalk, the crew help to prepare and fit their colleagues' spacesuits, which function as mini-spacecraft once they step outside. Ms. Koch shared photos on Twitter of her colleagues as they suited up for last Friday's spacewalk.","The astronauts, Anne McClain and Christina Koch, will both walk in space — just not together, because only one medium-size torso component is available.",c54fba49-c676-5c4d-9fc2-3d9adb49deb5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/25/science/25xp-NASA/25xp-NASA-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=cb0aea28e4d9b4c1c064724d76d7eb40ada12bffa968d8ebc3e1750d9cf837de&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Christina Koch is scheduled to do her first spacewalk on Friday, but not with another female astronaut as had previously been planned.",c54fba49-c676-5c4d-9fc2-3d9adb49deb5,N24News/imgs/c54fba49-c676-5c4d-9fc2-3d9adb49deb5.jpg,2
Style,"It's Spring, Right?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/19/style/is-it-spring.html,"Spring seems to arrive out of nowhere each year, a sudden and implausible 30-degree leap in temperature from what is always, somehow, the worst winter the city has ever seen. If not the coldest, the longest. If neither notably cold nor notably long, still somehow the grimmest. New Yorkers wake up one morning to find the weather insisting on certain activities. We have been starved, and now we must feast.

At long last, we remember what it's like to not just tolerate but enjoy being outside. We remember what it's like to sit outside at a restaurant, a baseball game, a park or a bar. We remember that it can be O.K. to expose significant expanses of skin to the elements. We recover items that have been balled up in drawers and buried at the bottom of closets for half a year. Remember those white shoes? That lightweight shirt that fit just right and which Uniqlo decided to stop selling even though it's very obvious that it is a perfect shirt and should be available forever? They might even still fit.

It is time to put the casseroles and soups aside. Now we want fresh fruits and vegetables. And the Northeast is home to many of the most springlike ones: fresh peas, asparagus, delicate greens, ramps, strawberries, rhubarb. The farmers' markets are an essential part of the summer and fall to New Yorkers and tourists alike, from wealthy Upper East Siders to the tens of thousands of New Yorkers who use SNAP benefits at the markets. But spring produce is not quite what you think it is.

Looking at the ""What's Available"" chart on the GrowNYC website -- this is the organization that runs the city's farmers' markets -- is usually helpful. In April, it is mean. The green blobs, which indicate food that is harvested that month, are restricted to two items: mesclun and parsnips. Many of the items listed as coming into season in May take a very loose interpretation of the months. If you can find fresh summer squash in the month of May, the date can't be much earlier than the 30th or the 31st. Asparagus does not start appearing until mid-May; strawberries don't come until late May or even early June. The spring farmers' markets are a bizarre mishmash of items that range dramatically in quality and provenance. The apples come from refrigerated storage facilities, placed there in November. Most every farmer either rents or owns refrigerated storage space in order to keep selling through the winter and into the misleading spring. The root vegetables may be freshly harvested, but they are winter's bounty, insulated by snow and burlap until recently. Tomatoes and cucumbers are grown in hothouses; they are as misleading as wax beans. (Wax beans are the same as green beans. Do not be fooled. They are just yellow.) Much of the activity at a spring farmers' market is appropriately non-transactional. Plenty of people at the farmers' market, even in the height of late summer glory, are not really there to shop.

At your own risk, of course. A long walk through one of the botanical gardens, Prospect Park or Central Park is likely to be spoiled by an impossibly hard rainfall. Four-dollar street umbrellas have not improved in quality since last year. The ground may be too raw and muddy for sitting in the park. Unlike people on the West Coast, East Coasters are unused to large changes in temperature from day to night; the few weeks of spring are a rarity in that they require frequent alterations in layering. An after-work outdoor drink sounds great until the temperature goes from 70 to 50 in the span of a drink and a half. The cool nights are pleasant, to be sure, but ""pleasant"" can be jarring in a city used to extremes. Sometimes you will play a game of chicken at an outdoor bar, when the temperature has dropped far too low for comfort and the attire that was appropriate earlier in the day. Who will be the first to suggest we move inside?

The debate of hot coffee versus cold coffee is not likely to be resolved in any satisfactory way during the spring. Sometimes the correct answer will be one and sometimes it will be the other. Sometimes you will choose wrong, and find you have completely lost feeling in your fingers for attempting to grasp a cup full of ice in 45-degree rain.

Science,That Vexing Math Equation? Here's an Addition,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/science/math-equation-pemdas-bodmas.html,"Recently I wrote about a math equation that had managed to stir up a debate online. The equation was this one:

The issue was that it generated two different answers, 16 or 1, depending on the order in which the mathematical operations were carried out. As youngsters, math students are drilled in a particular convention for the ""order of operations,"" which dictates the order thus: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (to be treated on equal footing, with ties broken by working from left to right), and addition and subtraction (likewise of equal priority, with ties similarly broken). Strict adherence to this elementary PEMDAS convention, I argued, leads to only one answer: 16.

Nonetheless, many readers (including my editor), equally adherent to what they regarded as the standard order of operations, strenuously insisted the right answer was 1. What was going on? After reading through the many comments on the article, I realized most of these respondents were using a different (and more sophisticated) convention than the elementary PEMDAS convention I had described in the article.

[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]

In this more sophisticated convention, which is often used in algebra, implicit multiplication is given higher priority than explicit multiplication or explicit division, in which those operations are written explicitly with symbols like x * / or /. Under this more sophisticated convention, the implicit multiplication in 2(2 + 2) is given higher priority than the explicit division in 8/2(2 + 2). In other words, 2(2+2) should be evaluated first. Doing so yields 8/2(2 + 2) = 8/8 = 1. By the same rule, many commenters argued that the expression 8/2(4) was not synonymous with 8/2x4, because the parentheses demanded immediate resolution, thus giving 8/8 = 1 again.

This convention is very reasonable, and I agree that the answer is 1 if we adhere to it. But it is not universally adopted. The calculators built into Google and WolframAlpha use the more elementary convention; they make no distinction between implicit and explicit multiplication when instructed to evaluate simple arithmetic expressions.",The confusion (likely intentional) boiled down to a discrepancy between the math rules used in grade school and in high school.,f7959ff1-3649-5298-9446-9e77a1bce6bd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/04/science/00math-comment/00math-comment-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=d030be0b29ce81e3fb851220fed19f30ffd641a1b6f2dba8efc07212ac858b68&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A math equation recently stirred up trouble by seeming to offer two equally valid, and very different, solutions.

Food,The Four Rules of Thanksgiving Wines,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/dining/drinks/review-thanksgiving-wines.html,"Human behavior is often unpredictable. But immutable rules seem to govern certain situations, like Thanksgiving entertaining. Rule No. 1: You will be anxious before the holiday. This is inescapable. You will worry that you have not sufficiently disguised the conditions under which you ordinarily live, which is what cleaning house usually achieves. You will be concerned that you do not have enough food, while at the same time fearing that you have too much, and that the turkey will be ready too soon, or too late, or never. You will dread underlying tensions among family members and overbearing behavior. I have not even mentioned the wine.

Rule No. 2: The holiday always goes beautifully. This is the saving grace, invariably forgotten. If kept in mind, it can easily make these jittery few days far more bearable. For most families, Thanksgiving this year will not be unlike Thanksgiving any other year. Whatever new elements arrive in 2017, the foreboding is the same as always. Nonetheless, the projected disasters almost never occur. Everybody has a great time. Remembering this will not help to achieve preliminary serenity, but understanding the process can make the angst easier to endure. In order to help, the Thanksgiving wine panel annually tries to eliminate wine selections from your areas of concern. Each year, we share a Thanksgiving feast in advance. We each bring two bottles of wine to the meal, each costing no more than $25, with the aim of adding to our understanding of which types of wines work best. As with many families, we welcomed a new member this year. Our colleague Tejal Rao -- sitting in for Julia Moskin, who was away on assignment -- joined me, Florence Fabricant, Pete Wells and our tasting coordinator, Bernard Kirsch.

Over the years, we have learned and affirmed that wine is the least consequential issue anybody will face at Thanksgiving. Why is that? Rule No. 3: If the food is good and the company convivial, you cannot go wrong with the wine. If the food is bad and the company annoying, wine can only help. What's the worst that can happen with wine? Only one potential disaster looms: running out. The single most important guideline for selecting wine for Thanksgiving is simply to have enough on hand. We generally recommend one bottle per wine-drinking adult. This may seem like a lot, but it is simply a hedge against an insufficient supply. You do not have to finish it all. If you like, you can even give away unopened bottles with the leftovers. Beyond quantity, you need to provide both reds and whites. You can add rose or a sparkling wine, but both red and white are essential. You will have guests who contend that red wine gives them headaches or white wine gives them heartburn. This is not the time to debate these issues. Let guests drink what they want unfettered. In our calculus, we imagine Thanksgiving as a large, freewheeling buffet meal, with lots of different dishes and a sprawling patchwork of flavors. It's not the time to fret about pairing particular dishes with certain bottles. The trick is to provide versatile, nimble wines that pair well with many foods and will not be as fatiguing as everything else. That generally means bottles not especially high in alcohol, generally below 14 percent. They should not be tannic or oaky, but they must be energetic with lively acidity, which helps to refresh and cleanse the palate. Over the course of many years we have identified wines that almost always work well: Beaujolais and bone-dry sauvignon blancs are crowd-pleasers. Basic Italian reds made of barbera or sangiovese are fine, as are Italian whites made of fiano or carricante. Loire reds, pinot noirs, chardonnays, chenin blancs, mencias from Spain, rieslings -- all are fine choices.

These wines, I should say, fit our particular vision of the feast. If you are having a small dinner party for six with multiple courses and you would like to serve precious bottles poured into exquisite glasses, by all means do. For our party, we assume a crowd who might be drinking from tumblers or even paper cups. These are fine for big parties. But I do recommend steering clear of plastic goblets, which have a nasty habit of separating bowl from stem at the worst possible moments for your clothing, carpeting and anxiety threshold. Almost all the wines the panel sampled were excellent, and the few that fell short were nonetheless fine. Tejal brought the two most fascinating wines, both white, sort of. The first, the 2016 Caprice du Chameau from La Vrille et Le Papillon, a brother-and-sister team who make natural wines in the Ardeche region of southeastern France, was unfiltered, giving the wine a hazy appearance. Yet it was sublimely light and spicy, vibrant and thoroughly delicious. Surprisingly, it was made of viognier, which I usually associate with heavier, fruitier wines. Though visually unusual, the wine was ideal, with what Pete called ""a feeling of over the river and through the woods."" Tejal's second bottle was more challenging, a 2015 from RuBor Viticultores, made of chasselas, a Swiss white grape unaccountably planted 70 years ago in Cebreros in the Sierra de Gredos, a range of hills that cuts through central Spain. Though made from white grapes, the wine had been made as if it were a red. Instead of immediately separating the juice of the grapes from the skins, the producers macerated them together, extracting tannins and pigment. The gritty, amber-colored result was savory, intense and unusual, and perhaps better for a crowd of questing wine fanatics than a general-interest holiday group. I would happily serve it with cheese, though not for the long haul of a feast. Pete brought a rose sparkling wine, a light, lacy cava from Dibon in the Penedes region of Spain. This fruity cava, unusually made entirely of the garnacha grape, would make a delightful aperitif, though we all would prefer not to drink sparkling wine throughout the feast.

His other wine was an inspired selection, a 2013 Tinto, or red, from the intriguing Barraida region of Portugal from Sidonio de Sousa, made from the baga grape. It was spicy, herbal and lightly fruity, and had just the sort of light-bodied charm that could carry through the entire meal. Bernie took an unusual tack in selecting his white. He chose a Quincy, a Loire sauvignon blanc, because, he said, he remembered a meal many years ago when a Quincy was universally reviled. This suggestion of overt hostility to the group could not be rewarded. We disappointed him by thoroughly enjoying the wine, a clean, citrusy 2013 from Domaine Trotereau. We compounded the issue by liking his red even more, a 2013 pinot noir from Red Tail Ridge in the Finger Lakes. Its pale brick color seemed more typical of an older wine, but it was bright, juicy and fresh. Florence's white, a 2016 sauvignon blanc from Matanzas Creek in Sonoma County, was an archetypal Thanksgiving white: neutral rather than flamboyant, a subtle character actor that would enhance rather than dominate. It had the sort of texture that continually invited another sip. Her red was also from Sonoma, a 2012 Buena Vista merlot. It had the opposite character of the Matanzas Creek, with fruit flavors that were too intense. Tejal called the effect ""sinister,"" but even so, it was easily tolerable. My own wines included a savory white Bordeaux, a 2015 Lune d'Argent from Clos des Lunes, made by the excellent Domaine de Chevalier. Though primarily semillon with a quarter sauvignon blanc, it had a lot in common with the Matanzas Creek in that it was more interesting texturally than aromatically. My red was a 2015 Cahors from Chateau Combel-la-Serre, an easygoing wine that combined plummy fruit and chalky mineral flavors. It was made of malbec, but was more restrained than many of the fruity malbecs from Argentina.

Cloudy, amber and intense with gritty tannins and oxidative flavors; perhaps not for a crowd. (A Katell Pleven Selection/The Vine Collective, New York) Inky dark, yet easygoing, combining plummy fruit and chalky, earthy flavors. (Louis/Dressner Selections, New York) Soft, smooth and well balanced, with flavors of dark fruits, spices and herbs. (NLC Wines, Brooklyn, N.Y.) Aromas of dark, saturated fruits, soft and dense, with staying power. A recent dinner at Gloria, an intimate new seafood restaurant in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, started on a fine note. Warm rounds of individual jalapeno-studded cornbread were served while we sipped cocktails. Always on the prowl for something new for the Thanksgiving menu, I thought of the cornbread as we sampled these Thanksgiving wine selections. Phil Johnson, an owner of Gloria, provided the recipe. But for Thanksgiving, instead of the four-inch cornbread disks served at the restaurant, I baked the batter in madeleine pans. I then froze the little cakes, so I would have them for the holiday. (I will reheat them covered in foil on a baking sheet at 275 degrees for 10 to 15 minutes.) The madeleines would welcome any quaff, cider or beer, not just wine. And the batter can also be baked in cast-iron corn stick molds, though the yield would be fewer, about 15. FLORENCE FABRICANT Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

Technology,Our Guide to the Holiday Season's Biggest Video Games and Consoles,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/technology/personaltech/holiday-video-games-consoles.html,"With the holiday season on its way, the games industry is pushing out a diverse lineup of titles, from new installments of long-running franchises like Activision's Call of Duty and Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed to EA's long-awaited Star Wars Battlefront II. But the real crowd pleasers this year may be in hardware. Microsoft and Nintendo are offering new or upgraded consoles after Sony rereleased its PlayStation 4 console and more powerful PS4 Pro last year. The hottest hardware ticket is Nintendo's Switch console, which offers gamers the option of plugging in at home or pulling it off its dock to play on the go. Even though it was released eight months ago, the Switch is still so popular that supply is expected to be a problem at the end of the year. The arrival this week of Microsoft's new Xbox One X console -- featuring more processing power and 4K resolution, which means more defined picture quality -- is also expected to make waves. The console supports hundreds of games from the Xbox back catalog, including all Xbox One titles, as well as select Xbox 360 titles.

All of this is expected to fuel spending on games, which rose 7 percent to $14 billion in the first half of the year from the same period in 2016, according to the NPD Group. ""I expect this growth to continue to edge up through the holidays,"" said Mat Piscatella, who analyzes the video games industry for NPD. Here are some of the most anticipated games products this holiday season. Activision's best-selling first-person shooter game returns with a new version developed by Sledgehammer Games.

The last three games in the annual franchise used futuristic settings and high-tech weapons, but the latest version returns to a World War II setting. Sledgehammer Games enlisted the help of a war historian, Martin Morgan, to help create accurate weapons and locations for the game, from the Normandy landings in June 1944 to the Battle of Hurtgen Forest. The game follows a young soldier from Texas as he makes his way across Europe with his unit. Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said Call of Duty: World War II would most likely be the biggest game of the holiday season. He projected it would sell 20 million units for a cool $1 billion.

So for this sequel, EA listened closely to players' feedback, said Matt Webster, an executive producer for the game. The result: Star Wars Battlefront II has nearly three times the content of the previous game, with more heroes, maps and vehicles, as well as redesigned space battles. EA is also starting a live service for the game so fans can get free content, including new playable characters, like Finn and Captain Phasma from the film""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" as well as new multiplayer maps that tie in with the release of ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" in December. ""The game has a movie coming out to support its marketing efforts, and is an easy gift for grandma to purchase at holiday,"" said Mr. Pachter. Super Mario Odyssey is the first main Mario platforming game -- in which players must make well-timed, precise jumps across a series of platforms while collecting power-ups and avoiding enemies and obstacles -- for the Nintendo Switch.

So far, reviews have been rapturous. ""Super Mario Odyssey now joins that very short list of what we think are essential games to play and own,"" said Randolph Ramsay, the editor in chief of GameSpot, a video game news and reviews site owned by CBS. After a year off in 2016, the action-adventure franchise has returned with a game that transports players to ancient Egypt.

The game is set much earlier -- in the first century B.C., around the time of Julius Caesar and Cleopatra -- than previous Assassin's Creed games, so players can explore the beginnings of the Brotherhood of Assassins, a renegade group fighting for freedom. The game's combat system has been overhauled, with the duel-style action of previous games replaced by a lock-on mechanic that means enemies don't really wait before they attack. In addition, players can now pursue or leave quests whenever they like, instead of having to finish off a quest to return to the main world.

Nintendo's console has been a hit with hard-core and casual gamers alike. As Nintendo's first new home console since the Wii U in 2012, the Switch remains in tight supply -- and demand is not slowing. Demand for the Nintendo Switch remains high even eight months after its release. Reviews for the Switch have been unanimously positive, praising its streamlined design and ability to seamlessly switch between at home and on the road without affecting how the games look and play. ""Not only does it have two of the best games released this year -- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey -- it's also an impressive piece of gaming tech that works well both as a home console and a portable machine,"" Mr. Ramsay of GameSpot said. Nintendo's SNES Classic console, which debuted in September, has become another hit. Nintendo's SNES Classic console is a miniaturized rerelease of the SNES console from the 1990s. The console is a miniaturized rerelease of the classic SNES console from the 1990s, a kind of novelty box that comes loaded with 21 games, including Super Mario World, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Final Fantasy III. The console plugs directly into a TV via HDMI, so players can use their current tech setup to play their childhood favorites.",The industry is pushing out a diverse lineup of titles and promoting new consoles to compete for people's wallets.,e8072713-a937-5772-a8a6-3d32da28bf09,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/07/business/09VIDGAME-3sub/09VIDGAME-3sub-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=afc62fcb6235a1a4dc5798caaf7f2b3660ae4effcd73c22bbc85a50c21d5fa68&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Star Wars Battlefront II has nearly three times the content of the previous version of the game.,e8072713-a937-5772-a8a6-3d32da28bf09,N24News/imgs/e8072713-a937-5772-a8a6-3d32da28bf09.jpg,20
Style,Skateboarders Won,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/07/style/skateparks-around-the-world.html,"In July 1995, the artist Maura Sheehan installed a skateable sculpture in the anchorage of the Brooklyn Bridge, over on the Brooklyn side. Ms. Sheehan became fascinated with skateboarders after observing large groups of them careening through the streets downtown in the era before 9/11. Much of that part of the city was still accessible to herds of rule-bending youth. ""Their building of community is really a profound thing,"" she said of the eclectic groups of skaters she would encounter. ""It forces discourse and interaction."" The hidden work -- a halfpipe that she found through a group of ""cowboy"" skaters traveling cross-country from California, who reconstructed it in every city they stopped in -- attracted more than just skaters. Ms. Sheehan recalled daredevils and spectators alike being drawn to the structure. ""It really was a living social organism,"" she said. Steve Rodriguez, 46, a professional skateboarder and the owner of 5boro skateboards, helped build Ms. Sheehan's ramp in 1995. A little more than a decade later, on the Manhattan side of the bridge, he helped organize the city's skate community in order to save a portion of the so-called Brooklyn Banks, a popular spot for local skaters at the time. In this case, the city promised to eventually turn part of the area into a proper skatepark.

Skateboarding had gone from renegade to recreation. After decades of commandeering streets, sidewalks, parking lots and public sculptures, skaters entered the mainstream. Now New York City, the United States, and the world at large have all seen a surge of skate park development. With skateboarding entering the Olympic Games in 2020, the international growth of skate parks is likely only beginning. ""A lot of funding for recreation is based off the Olympics, so we're going to see a lot more skate parks and skate facilities built worldwide,"" said Thomas Barker, the executive director of the International Association of Skateboard Companies. Mr. Rodriguez found that the grass-roots effort was the beginning of a new relationship with local government. He has since worked with the Department of Transportation, which controls all the land under bridges in New York, as well as the Parks Department, to build a number of skate parks around the city -- creations that have quietly multiplied across the boroughs, becoming a defining piece of the modern urban landscape.

In Harlem, a new skate park opened at Thomas Jefferson Park in September. The Bronx will see the completion of Williamsbridge Oval Skatepark in early 2019. Mr. Rodriguez recently worked on designs for a skate park currently under construction near the refurbished Kosciuszko Bridge. These new entrants follow the construction of Golconda Skatepark in Downtown Brooklyn, in 2016, and Cooper Skatepark in Bushwick the same year. In Los Angeles, the highly regarded Stoner Skate Plaza opened in 2010 and features recreated elements of bygone local skate spots. The architect Anthony Bracali teamed up with skateboarders in Philadelphia for the 2.5-acre Paine's Park, completed in 2013. The Seattle Skate Park Advisory Committee has spent the past decade advocating skate parks in that city, arguing that Seattle's more than 29,000 skaters needed dedicated space to skate. Today, the city is home to a growing number of skate parks, as well as more than a dozen designated skate spots and ""skate dots"": individual obstacles spread across the city designed for people to skate. The Tony Hawk Foundation, a leading partner in the construction of skate parks in the United States, estimates that there are roughly 3,500 skate parks in the country now -- still about a third of what it says the country needs. ""We would like to ultimately see a skate park in every neighborhood, or for every neighborhood, so that the skate park could take on sort of provincial pride,"" said Peter Whitley, programs director for the foundation. In a different time, hoping for city officials to get on board with building a skate park seemed like an impossible task. Mr. Whitley said a great deal of Nimby-ism once plagued developments. But aging Gen X grew up alongside skateboarding's ascent in popular culture, from Bart Simpson plonking down onto the roof of the family car in the opening sequence of ""The Simpsons"" to blockbuster video game franchises like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Skateboarding is no longer something people fear. The skate punk of the late 1980s is now a suburban dad. Across runways, and in music videos and film, subtle influences of skate culture are noticeable. Everyone wears Vans sneakers.

The growing acceptance of skateboarding hasn't made skate park development simple. Mr. Whitley points to municipal budget shortages as a constant source of frustration, and Mr. Rodriguez laments the myriad parks built without proper skater input, or without considering the landscape. He said that the scattered prefabricated obstacles installed at Thomas Jefferson Park in Harlem represent a missed opportunity. ""It's like, how long have these kids been waiting for a skate park? And that's what they got."" Mr. Rodriguez said. But there is no doubt a peculiar and magnetic pull to public skate parks. They look unlike anything typically built by municipalities, with sloping ramps and oblong bowls that appear like sculpture jutting out of the terrain. Except these sculptures are alive. Walk by any local skate park and you'll bear witness to a young man or woman propelling themselves off one of these concrete monuments into another, or into the street. They have become the backdrop for an entire genre of video on Instagram, where skaters are known to publish edits at their local skate parks, taking turns filming each other on smartphones.

""I'm old school, so I began my account under the premise that filming at skate parks was absurd anyway,"" he wrote in an email. ""So the notion of a skate park footage critic on Instagram was equally outrageous, it had to be a joke."" For a long time, skate parks were looked down upon by skaters who preferred finding challenges, often illegally, in the streets. Filming at a skate park was akin to wearing a band's T-shirt to their concert, or wearing a mismatched tracksuit. ""Skate parks have always been designed to contain an activity that is about roaming, and often dangerous, or at least unlawful trespassing,"" Mr. Barrow said. But today's skaters seem less resistant to the idea of using these purpose-built spaces, even if it does translate to less time in the streets. One reason may be how much easier it is to show off at a skate park. Mr. Barrow explained that skateboarding has always thrived on an element of performance. Skate parks, coupled with the immediacy of social media, have created a distinctly modern dynamic. ""As skate parks themselves have proliferated, they have become more central to that idea of performance, both fashionable and athletic,"" Mr. Barrow wrote.

Iain Borden, a professor of architecture and urban culture at University College in London, wrote the book ""Skateboarding, Space, and the City"" in 2000. He also sees the growth of skate parks as a social phenomenon. ""They're places of social exchange,"" he said. ""You could argue that they're not sports facilities, they're social landscapes in which skateboarding and riding and scootering and blading are some of the activities that you might do."" He recalled the scene at a soft opening for a new skate park in South London: a whole pile of citizens, from many races and sexual orientations, communing together like in a rendering for some idealized plaza. ""You just look at it and you think, 'Oh my God these are extraordinary places,'"" Mr. Borden said. ""And people were talking to each other as well. It wasn't a shopping street where they are all walking past each other."" On an unseasonably warm afternoon in March, Zelda Santiago, 26, a part-time model who grew up in Georgia, rode through Coleman Skatepark on the Lower East Side. The park was renovated in 2011 with help from Mr. Rodriguez and Nike. (Good skate park design, Mr. Rodriguez said, is defined by the ability of skaters to flow through the park without stopping, each obstacle a logical, and playful, distance apart.) With another young skater seated on a nearby bench serving as his videographer, Mr. Santiago pushed off a small concrete slope into a dense metal fence, gliding across the top before landing back into the slope -- a ""wallride"" in skater's parlance. It's one of the more graceful maneuvers one can perform at the park. And with a mop of dark curly hair, Mr. Santiago, who wore large corduroy trousers and Italian loafers, looked like a surfer in church clothes, which is to say he looked very good. ""It gets a lot of kids away from trouble,"" he said of skate parks popping up around the city. ""If the park is closer, your instincts will be to go skate, versus whatever it is that could get you locked up."" Skate parks do have the potential to serve as tools for neighborhood redevelopment. The area under the Burnside bridge, in Portland, Ore., was a hotbed of illegal activity before a group of skateboarders, in the early '90s, began constructing concrete ramps at the site, eventually earning the blessing of the city.

Unlike other traditional harbingers of transformation, like coffee shops and expensive clothing stores, skate parks offer something egalitarian. In liberal societies like Copenhagen, where local officials seek out the advice of skateboarders when designing public plazas, skate parks represent a progressive viewpoint on how to engage with public space. What started with independent groups of skaters cadging together D.I.Y. skate parks out of concrete and scrap wood grew into a movement to make the entire city a skate park. The CPH Open, an annual skateboarding competition that invites skaters from around the world to skate the streets of Copenhagen, is the work of a committee made up of local skaters and has the support of city officials. Simon Strange, a member of the left-leaning Social Democrats on the city council, pushed for the city to help fund the event. In Lagos, Nigeria, a group of resourceful youths recently installed a halfpipe for a one-day event in the Victoria Island area of the city; Morocco recently saw the construction of a new concrete skate park, produced through a community partnership with the nonprofit Make Skate Life; in Kabul, Afghanistan, a skate park doubles as a space for young women to learn, thanks to Skateistan, an NGO; Shangilia, in Kenya, became the first skate park in East Africa, with support from the nonprofit Skate Aid. And in South Korea, Mr. Borden said, young people responding to rigid expectations from adults have centered much of their lives on the skate park. Sometimes they cook dinners there. But what could it say about the times that skate parks have come to be accepted by those in power? ""There is an idea that the kinds of things that skateboarding teaches people, it's exactly those kinds of values, of robustness and confidence and independence, that neoliberal society wants to produce in its citizens,"" Mr. Borden said. ""There is an argument that skateboarding and skate parks are neoliberal training grounds."" Maybe!","Skate parks, once considered a menace, are booming everywhere around the world. Now we head toward the first skateboarding Olympics.",087d49e1-c9e6-5039-b811-59749f840a55,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/08/fashion/08SKATEPARKS3/08SKATEPARKS3-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=6b03ab7a1e506fd6616741b484e33220acd9f2cf00246092a76008480df7b368&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Coleman Skatepark in Manhattan.,087d49e1-c9e6-5039-b811-59749f840a55,N24News/imgs/087d49e1-c9e6-5039-b811-59749f840a55.jpg,15
Books,The Sniping Scientists Whose Work Saved Millions of Lives,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/03/books/review/michael-kinch-between-hope-and-fear.html,"Kinch, a research scientist, now at Washington University in St. Louis, who has worked on both immunology and cancer and has published a previous book on the crisis in drug development, recounts this history in scholarly detail. Although Edward Jenner is credited with the discovery of vaccination, for using cowpox to inoculate against smallpox, it was already known in his day that survivors of smallpox were immune to further episodes of the disease. The Chinese and the Ottomans had been using ""variolation"" for centuries, a procedure in which people were deliberately infected with material from smallpox scabs applied inside the nostrils or under the skin. Some of the inoculated patients died, but many fewer than would have had they contracted the disease the conventional way.

Kinch's tale picks up speed and interest in the second half of the 19th century, when it was finally understood that infections were caused by microorganisms and not by foul vapors, known as ""miasma."" As with so much biological science, it's a complicated story, featuring dozens of scientists, many of them scrabbling for a place on -- rather than gratefully ascending -- a predecessor's shoulders, and numerous discoveries that were the result of sheer luck. Robert Koch and Paul Ehrlich in Germany, and Louis Pasteur in France, dominated the early years of microbiology, but their professional relations were often riven by competition and conflict. Koch was famously insulted at a conference when an interpreter mistranslated Pasteur's phrase ""recueil allemand"" (a collection of German writing) as ""orgueil allemand"" (German arrogance). And Pasteur deliberately suppressed -- and ordered his colleagues to follow suit -- the fact that he had committed fraud during a public demonstration of his anthrax vaccine. (He used a chemical method to attenuate the virus but claimed he had not.) Pasteur succeeded in developing a rabies vaccine, but much of his work was derivative, taken wholesale from the veterinarian Pierre Galtier, whom he failed to credit and who slipped into oblivion.

A similar fate befell other pioneers in the field, such as the Jewish-Ukrainian scientist Waldemar Haffkine, who, working in the British Raj, developed toxoid vaccines for both bubonic plague and cholera. (A toxoid is a weakened version of toxins produced by bacteria, as opposed to a weakened form of the bacterium itself.) When 19 patients in the Punjab died of tetanus contracted from a contaminated bottle of plague vaccine, Haffkine was unjustly held responsible. Although he was eventually shown to be innocent, his treatment -- he was effectively exiled from his profession -- was compared to that of Alfred Dreyfus.

Kinch has done these early scientists a great service by recounting their contributions. There are some fascinating episodes about the discovery and use of bacteriophages (viruses that attack bacteria) and the way in which they might become important again as antibiotic resistance is increasingly a problem.

The final, and most important, chapters of the book deal with the contemporary anti-vaccination movement and its possibly lethal consequences, including several passages on the British doctor Andrew Wakefield, who falsely claimed that the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was responsible for autism. Kinch shows that public anxiety about vaccines is nearly as old as vaccines themselves. In the 1970s, there was widespread doubt in Britain over the safety of the DTP vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough). One prominent opponent, Dr. Gordon Stewart, went on to maintain that AIDS was caused not by H.I.V. but by homosexual behavior. His view had a major influence on the South African president Thabo Mbeki, whose AIDS policies were subsequently estimated in a report by the Harvard School of Public Health to have resulted in 365,000 avoidable deaths.","Michael Kinch's ""Between Hope and Fear: A History of Vaccines and Human Immunity"" recounts the brilliant insights and bitter rivalries behind the discoveries of lifesaving vaccines.",c734a913-cfe6-560f-9917-965c23732e82,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/09/books/review/09Marsh/09Marsh-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=5287b38b58905b5eac0d0662c6c58956afaae99a6d1c2107ace0fec61ee2e0b8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,New York City Residents being vaccinated against smallpox in 1947.,c734a913-cfe6-560f-9917-965c23732e82,N24News/imgs/c734a913-cfe6-560f-9917-965c23732e82.jpg,13

Economy,A Farmer's Tough Year on the Trade War's Kansas Front,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/business/economy/farmer-trade-tariffs.html,"Justin Knopf in the office on his family farm in Kansas.Credit...Christopher Smith for The New York Times



Justin Knopf in the office on his family farm in Kansas.

Justin Knopf finished harvesting soybeans as November's first snowflakes started falling on his fields in Gypsum, Kan. Then he did what thousands of farmers throughout the grain belt are doing: He got an application for some of the $12 billion in federal emergency relief intended to blunt the economic fallout from President Trump's trade policy brinkmanship. China, the biggest buyer of American soybeans, all but stopped purchases after the White House imposed tariffs this summer and set a retaliatory spiral in motion. The pronouncements and maneuvers in world capitals have reverberated through the kitchens and living rooms of farmers, who were targets in part because they are big exporters and core supporters of Mr. Trump. ""Some say enough already -- it's a big gamble and the timing is horrible for us to be messing with trade,"" Mr. Knopf said. ""Other farmers are incredibly excited about what the administration is doing on trade and truly believe they'll come up with a better deal for us long term. I'm probably somewhere in the middle. I'm cautiously hopeful.""

The past year has tested the patience and resilience of Mr. Knopf, 40, who lives on the farm with his wife , Lindsey, and three children. For now, he is waiting to see what happens when Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China meet at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Argentina on Friday and Saturday before deciding what to do with the rest of his soybean harvest. UPDATE: The United States and China appeared to call a truce in their trade war on Saturday, after Mr. Trump agreed to hold off on new tariffs and Mr. Xi pledged to increase Chinese purchases of American products, including soybeans. Here's what the past four seasons have been like for Mr. Knopf.

Trade frictions with China mounted through most of last year, but when Mr. Trump traveled to Beijing in November, the tone changed. The president piled praise on Mr. Xi, and blamed the United States for inequitable trade deals. It looked as if relations were warming, and the price of soybeans was floating around $9.90 a bushel. On the farm, Mr. Knopf was deciding how many acres of soybeans, sorghum and corn to plant in the spring to take advantage of an early-order discount for seed. As a no-till farmer, he diversifies and rotates crops to create healthier soil, instead of plowing and relying heavily on pesticides. Those considerations play an important role in his crop choices, but so do calculations about what looks as if it will fetch the best price over the next year. Soybeans seemed to promise a better return, so Mr. Knopf went ahead with increasing his soybean acreage.

For years, family farmers have struggled with limp prices, tight credit and more extreme weather. ""Trade is just one more thing to worry about,"" Mr. Knopf said . T ensions heated up in January and February. Two weeks after Mr. Trump placed new tariffs on washing machines and solar panels, Chinese officials began an anti-dumping inquiry into American exports of sorghum. Mr. Knopf said China's announcement was ""when the reality really sank in that this trade war was going to have a significant impact on my farm here in the middle of central Kansas."" ""Our local price that day dropped by -- I believe it was 80 cents,"" he said. ""Just that one announcement from China decreased my potential revenue by 20 percent in one day."" Soon, though, the sorghum and soybean prices rebounded. Hopes for a trade deal give way to a trade war

Less than two weeks later, though, Mr. Trump said he was moving ahead with a plan to impose 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of imported Chinese goods within the next month. China retaliated and identified $50 billion worth of American goods for a 25 percent tariff. Mr. Knopf had decided to reduce his corn and sorghum acreage because soybean prices looked favorable. He had finished planting corn and was halfway through his soybean fields when prices started sinking. ""All of a sudden, things have changed pretty quickly,"" he said. He could have sold part or all of his spring crops in advance, but rain had been sparse. ""I wasn't in a good mood to sell before I had a better picture of what we had planted and if the crop was off to a good start,"" he said.

Washington and Beijing seesawed through a set of punishing threats and tariffs. The first China-specific tariffs went into effect on July 6. Beijing responded by imposing tariffs on American products, including soybeans. By mid-July the price sank to $8.18 a bushel, the lowest in nearly a decade. At the same time, Midwestern farmers were contending with a drought. ""This affects my family each day,"" Mr. Knopf said. ""Some days, I just think I need to -- golly, I need to trust what he's doing,"" he said of the president. ""Other days, I think, 'Golly, I wish this would be over.'"" ""The president keeps calling us farmers great patriots and keeps asking us to trust him and says that we're going to end up with a better deal,"" Mr. Knopf said. ""That is in the back of farmers' minds. But at the same time, we can only do this for so long."" Mr. Trump sent out an early-morning Twitter post on July 24 that ""Tariffs are the greatest!""

Later that day, the administration announced $12 billion in emergency relief for farmers. ""It's nice that the administration has recognized that this is having an impact on our local pricing,"" Mr. Knopf said. ""On the other hand, any farmer will tell you we'd much rather have markets that are open and fair."" On Aug. 1, Mr. Knopf sold 2,000 bushels of soybeans at the local cash price of $8.25 a bushel. ""I remember thinking 'O.K., prices have come back some, at least we're off the lows, although they're not what they were,'"" he recalled. ""I would have liked to have done much more, but I wasn't sure how many bushels we were going to raise. We were on the verge of almost having areas in the field begin to die because of the drought."" The next day, tensions between China and the United States rose again, with virtually no break through most of September. On Sept. 18, after a list of Chinese goods was drawn up for a new tariff, soybeans fell to $8.14 a bushel.

At a United Nations Security Council session on Sept. 24, Mr. Trump accused the Chinese of trying to interfere in the midterm elections. By the time this cycle of threats, counterthreats and complaints to the World Trade Organization concluded, the United States had applied tariffs to $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and China had imposed tariffs on $110 billion worth of American goods, including soybeans. In the Kansas fields, rain delayed the start of the harvest until the first week in October. Mr. Knopf noticed that the local price he could get for his soybean crop was diverging more and more from the benchmark price on the Chicago Board of Trade, further depressing his return. So on Oct. 15, he sold 3,000 bushels at $7.70. A couple of weeks later, with the midterm elections a few days away, Mr. Trump offered some hope about an agreement at a meeting with Mr. Xi at the end of November.

The same day that Mr. Trump sent that soothing signal, Mr. Knopf decided to sell another 5,000 bushels while prices remained steady. A couple of days later, he harvested the last of the soybeans, but chose to store the final batch -- roughly 4,500 bushels -- at a grain elevator. He is waiting to see if the Trump-Xi meeting produces a positive announcement that could lift prices. He knows there's a risk: ""If nothing comes out of the G-20 summit and prices fall, I will be penalized for waiting."" In any case, he hopes to have an acceptable price by the end of the year, so as to avoid further storage costs. That is also when the United States plans a further increase in tariffs on Chinese goods.

""There is more uncertainty now with trade than since I've been farming, 18 years ago,"" said Mr. Knopf. ""For my generation, this is the first and most extreme trade thing we've been through."" Over the last six months, he has become more skeptical of the president's policies. In early June, he said: ""We're willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. It's a different approach -- he's changing things up. Let's give it a try."" This week, Mr. Knopf sounded a darker tone: ""It's frustrating. We haven't seen a lot of progress."" Chinese tariffs on soybeans have reduced farmers' incomes, but American tariffs on foreign steel have significantly raised the costs of their machinery and equipment. ""We're on the wrong end of it on both sides,"" he said. The growing cycle has started again, and Mr. Knopf is planning next year's crop. The meeting this week between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi, he said, is ""really important to farmers who are already beginning to think about and make plans for spring."" Without an accord by planting season, ""I think the mood is going to sour pretty quickly,"" he said. ""Patience will run out.""

Technology,"Start-Ups Ask, 'Are We Making Money for Saudi Arabia?'",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/start-ups-venture-capital-saudi-arabia.html,"David Gutelius, a partner at the Data Guild, near his home in Reno, Nev. Discovering the sources of potential investors' funding was harder than he expected, he said.

SAN FRANCISCO -- When John Vrionis and Jyoti Bansal set out to raise money this year for their first venture capital fund, Unusual Ventures, industry peers advised them to go after the easy money -- sovereign wealth funds like those managed by Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, which have become major investors in Silicon Valley. ""People would say, 'It's really easy -- they'll give you as much money as you want,'"" Mr. Vrionis said. But the pair said they didn't feel comfortable making investments on behalf of repressive governments. Instead, they sought investments from nonprofit groups, historically black universities and children's hospitals. That move has helped them avoid difficult conversations in recent weeks, as gruesome details emerged about the murder in Istanbul of Jamal Khashoggi, a journalist who had been critical of the Saudi Arabian government. On Wednesday, the chief prosecutor of Istanbul said Mr. Khashoggi had been strangled almost as soon as he stepped into the Saudi Consulate in the city. Some of the agents who have been detained in connection with the killing have been linked to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

""This has started the conversation of 'Where is the money coming from?'"" Mr. Bansal said. Other Silicon Valley investors are in a more uncomfortable position. Some start-up founders are asking their investors whether they have financial connections to a foreign government with a poor human rights record. Others say that from now on, they will demand to know the source of investment money. But it is easy for founders to ask where the money is coming from, and much harder for them to take action. Often, it is difficult to figure out where venture capital firms are getting their money, because the firms rarely disclose that information. And even if start-up executives discover that some of their money is from an unwelcome source, it is tricky to give back money already accepted -- and possibly spent. The efforts and calls for action are nascent. Luis von Ahn, chief executive of a language-learning app, Duolingo, said he had recently taken a closer look at the more than $100 million his company had raised from investors, including Union Square Venture and Kleiner Perkins. He does not believe any of it came from Saudi Arabia, he said, but he added that he could not be sure, given the complex, opaque network of investment vehicles that back venture capital funds. Mr. von Ahn said the information was more useful for evaluating potential future investments than reassessing past ones, and that he planned to raise the question with potential investors if Duolingo sought more investment. ""There are all kinds of places I personally wouldn't want to have money from,"" he said. Amol Sarva, a founder of Knotel, a co-working start-up, said he had been telling bankers and fund-raising advisers that he wants to avoid money from certain groups, including ""evil governments.""

""All money is green, but there is plenty of it all around,"" he said. ""If we can choose who we talk to, we will."" Fred Wilson, a partner at Union Square Ventures, a prominent firm in New York, wrote on his blog last week that a chief executive of a company in its portfolio had, for the first time, asked about the firm's financial ties. He said he expected more emails like that in the coming weeks. Mr. Wilson wrote that he didn't have completely ""clean hands,"" because his firm had once sold shares in a portfolio company to a ""buyer who was fronting for gulf interests."" But he said Union Square Ventures' funds had not raised money from repressive governments, and he called for venture capital firms and start-ups to find out whether they could be proud of their investors. ""Sadly, the answer for many will be no and it will not be easy to unwind those relationships,"" Mr. Wilson wrote. Venture capital investors raise money from a variety of sources, including pension funds, college endowments, sovereign wealth funds, wealthy individuals and family fortunes. They then use the money to invest in start-ups with the potential for fast growth. Since the venture capital funds are privately held, they are under little obligation to disclose information about their activities. Some executives at the firms say they keep the information private for competitive reasons. Others do so at the request of the people and organizations, known as limited partners, that invest. Some top-tier firms, including Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins, are so secretive that they do not accept investments from public pension funds, which publish the results of their investments. These disclosures allow the public to know how much -- or little -- money the firms earned for their investors.

The lack of required disclosures makes following the money difficult. When reached for this article, many of the top firms in Silicon Valley, including Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins, Accel, Lightspeed, Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock, Benchmark and New Enterprise Associates, declined to publicly discuss their limited partners. But Saudi Arabia has been a big investor in tech. The kingdom's Public Investment Fund has made investments directly in some start-ups, like Uber and Magic Leap, an augmented-reality headset company. Neither company has given any indication that it would return the money. The kingdom has also invested in top venture firms. It sometimes strikes these deals through other entities, like the endowment fund of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, a Saudi research university that bears the name of the former ruler who created it. Only the largest and most powerful start-up investor, SoftBank, which raised $45 billion from Saudi Arabia for its Vision Fund, has made its association public. After the news of Mr. Khashoggi's death, David Gutelius, a partner at the Data Guild, a boutique venture ""studio"" that incubates and invests in start-ups, began asking prospective investors about the sources of their money. Finding them out was more difficult than he expected, Mr. Gutelius said, because many investments into the venture funds came from shell companies and other entities. But he said he had found pervasive ties to governments with poor human rights records, including Russia, China and Saudi Arabia. As a result of his discoveries, Mr. Gutelius said, he ended fund-raising conversations with three groups, including venture capital funds, and plans to cut off two more. He declined to name the groups. Last month, he announced that his firm would not take money from repressive regimes or have partnerships with any firms or companies that counted them as customers, investors or board members. ""I want to get back to building companies that matter to the world without worrying about which board is beholden to which regime,"" Mr. Gutelius said. ""That's not something we should even be having to discuss."" Roy Bahat, an investor at Bloomberg Beta, the venture capital arm of Bloomberg, said the questions were part of a growing realization in Silicon Valley about the global nature of investment money. He said some founders started asking him about venture fund limited partners about a year ago, when sovereign wealth funds became more aggressive in the technology industry. Bloomberg Beta has one limited partner, its parent company, Bloomberg.",Following the money isn't easy in the opaque world of venture capital.,c782a51a-e15d-58e9-a882-22ad34e102ac,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/29/us/29venture-promo/29venture-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=d6d306a7e73ea4bfc741fae49afd7b3a48c7cdaddfd855c14dcbaaee289035c1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"David Gutelius, a partner at the Data Guild, near his home in Reno, Nev.

Media,Daily News Newsroom Cut in Half by Tronc as Top Editor Is Ousted,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/business/media/tronc-daily-news-layoffs.html,"The meeting lasted less than a minute. By the time it was over, reporters and editors at The Daily News, the brawny New York tabloid that was once the largest-circulation paper in the country, learned that the newsroom staff would be cut in half and that its editor in chief was out of a job. In the hours that followed, journalists in various departments, from sports to metro, received formal notification that they had been laid off by Tronc, the media company based in Chicago that bought the paper last year. ""People were crying and hugging each other,"" said Scott Widener, a researcher who had worked at The News since 1990. ""I've dodged a lot of bullets over the years, and I just couldn't dodge this one."" In its heyday, The News was a staple publication of the city's working class, an elbows-out tabloid that thrived when it dug into crime and corruption. It served as a model for The Daily Planet, the paper that counted Clark Kent and Lois Lane among its reporters, and for the scrappy tabloid depicted in the 1994 movie ""The Paper.""

With Tronc's firing of more than 40 newsroom employees -- including 25 of 34 sports journalists and most of the photo department -- The News joins the ranks of walking-wounded papers at a time when readers have gravitated toward the quick-hit convenience of digital media. Under Jim Rich, the editor who lost his job on Monday, The News positioned itself as an unapologetically liberal counterpuncher to Rupert Murdoch's New York Post. Mr. Rich, who declined to comment for this article, transformed the front page -- ""the wood,"" in tabloid parlance -- into a venue for criticizing and often ridiculing President Trump.

""The web kind of changed the DNA of every paper,"" said Joel Siegel, a former managing editor at The News who is now managing editor of the cable news channel NY1. [For New Yorkers, the thirst for local ink isn't what it used to be.] Grant Whitmore, an executive at Tronc, presided over the brief meeting, which took place shortly after 9 a.m. in the paper's seventh-floor newsroom in Lower Manhattan. About 50 staff members were in attendance, a group that did not include Mr. Rich or Kristen Lee, the managing editor, who was also laid off. Afterward, human resources workers delivered the bad news to employees, including the sports columnist John Harper, the arts reporter Joe Dziemianowicz and the City Hall reporter Erin Durkin. ""I firmly believe that today's actions will position The Daily News for growth in the years ahead,"" Mr. Whitmore said in a memo to the remaining staff members at the end of the day, ""and I look forward to working with this group to capture the opportunities in front of us."" He added that Tronc remained ""committed to print."" As news of the firing became public, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York issued a statement critical of the move. ""This will undoubtedly devastate many households and hurt an important New York institution and one of our nation's journalism giants,"" the governor said.

After noting that his father, Mario M. Cuomo, had eased the sale of The New York Post to Mr. Murdoch while governor when that paper nearly died in 1993, he added, ""I urge Tronc to reconsider this drastic move and stand ready to work with them to avert this disaster.""
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. It is hard to fathom what the paper's next issues will look like, given that the newsroom had shrunk significantly under its previous owner, Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the New York real estate developer and media mogul who bought the paper out of bankruptcy in 1993.

Ambitious projects like the series on New York Police Department's abuse of eviction rules -- for which The News shared a Pulitzer Prize with ProPublica in 2017 -- would seem difficult to pull off with an even smaller staff. Sarah Ryley, the reporter on the series, who left The News last year, said it had taken three years to complete because she and the rest of the staff were stretched thin after the layoffs under Mr. Zuckerman. ""You used to go into the office and feel the energy,"" said Frank Isola, a sports columnist at The News for nearly 25 years, who was among those laid off on Monday. ""I've probably been in the office, I would say, maybe three times in the last three years. People tell me: 'Don't come in. It's depressing.'""

 Since Tronc bought the ailing tabloid from Mr. Zuckerman in September 2017 -- for a reported $1; yes, one dollar -- the company has been working to transform The News into something more digital. ""But we have not gone far enough,"" the company said in a memo to the staff that announced its decision to reduce ""the size of the editorial team by approximately 50 percent"" and to shift its focus to breaking news.

Some News employees started packing last week, after the media newsletter Study Hall reported that the company planned to lay off a large portion of the staff. Although daily print circulation had sunk to roughly 200,000, Mr. Rich breathed new life into the paper. During two stints as editor -- a 13-month run that ended in 2016, and an encore that began in January -- he regularly published front pages that captured the staccato energy of social media. He was typically combative in a Twitter post on Monday: ""If you hate democracy and think local governments should operate unchecked and in the dark, then today is a good day for you,"" he wrote. Mr. Rich also dropped the Daily News affiliation from his Twitter bio. ""Just a guy sitting at home watching journalism being choked into extinction,"" it reads. The News had a digital reach of 23 million, but it wasn't enough. The challenge of wringing profits from page views has eluded much of the industry, and the paper proved unable to end its losing streak. According to securities filings, it lost $23.6 million in 2016. Since then, its business has continued to suffer. In naming Mr. York as the replacement for Mr. Rich, Tronc is following a playbook that did not have success at The Los Angeles Times, when, in similar fashion, it gave the job of top editor to an outsider with a business background. Lewis D'Vorkin, an executive at Forbes Media who specialized in broadening the company's native-advertising offerings, was Tronc's choice for the Los Angeles job. The newsroom greeted his appointment with skepticism, and Mr. D'Vorkin lasted two months in the role. After tensions between the newsroom employees and Tronc continued, the company sold the paper to Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong in February for $500 million. The longtime home of the columnists Jimmy Breslin, Dick Young and Liz Smith and the cartoonist Bill Gallo, The News reveled in its role as the voice of the average citizen. Etched into the stone above the entrance of its former home, the Daily News Building on East 42nd Street, is a phrase attributed to Abraham Lincoln: ""God must have loved the common man, he made so many of them.""","The Chicago-based media company bought the brawny New York tabloid less than a year ago.

But along the way, a rancorous debate has emerged over whether such courses will lead to better learning, lower costs and higher graduation rates -- or to the dismantling of public universities, downgraded or eliminated faculty jobs, and a second-class education for most students. Many universities have been quick to sign up with outside providers to offer the ""massive open online courses,"" known as MOOCs, either as stand-alone courses or in a hybrid format, with the online materials supplemented by a local faculty member. While they portray their online offerings as exploratory, many administrators hope the courses will help them expand their reach, rein in tuition and offer better instruction. Now a new discussion has begun about whether universities should collaborate to develop and share their courses and technology, rather than working with outside providers. This week, the Committee on Institutional Cooperation, a group of provosts from Big 10 universities, issued a position paper saying that higher education must take advantage of new education technology -- but perhaps on its own. On a small scale, C.I.C. members' CourseShare program already does that, with members sharing classes in less commonly taught languages.

""Many of us feel more comfortable building our own infrastructure, rather than relying on a for-profit company,"" said Karen Hanson, provost of the University of Minnesota and the committee's chairwoman. ""We think we want to remain in control of our own intellectual property."" Like most of the universities in the group, the University of Minnesota currently is a partner with Coursera, with five courses being offered and five more in the works. ""Coursera shares a lot of our values, and the faculty members involved have keen interest in experimenting with that format,"" the provost said. Daphne Koller, the Stanford computer science professor who is a founder of Coursera, said she thought the C.I.C. paper represented an exploratory discussion driven by anxieties about how online education would change higher education. Coursera's contract with its C.I.C. partners, she said, leaves them full control over their content, including all rights and usage. In addition, most universities' software infrastructure is provided by technology companies. ""Tech companies generally produce better code,"" she said. ""And I think when they consider it, most universities will not see any advantage in duplicating that work."" On many campuses, faculty oppose the spread of MOOCs, angry that their universities joined in with little consultation, undercutting the tradition of shared governance. Others argue that MOOCs will shortchange students, replacing the personal relationships that encourage learning. In April, Duke University pulled out of Semester Online, a consortium of universities sharing online courses, hosted by 2U, the online education platform, after the faculty voted down the project.

At San Jose State University, which has led the way in allowing the MOOCs to be used for credit, the philosophy department last month wrote an open letter to Michael Sandel, a Harvard professor whose online Justice course it refused to use, laying out its concerns about the impact of such courses. ""Let us not kid ourselves,"" the letter said, ""administrators at C.S.U. are beginning a process of replacing faculty with cheap online education."" This spring, the Amherst faculty voted against joining edX, the nonprofit Harvard-M.I.T. collaboration, and 58 Harvard faculty members sought the creation of a new committee to consider the effect online courses will have on higher education. Jonathan Rees, a history professor at Colorado State University at Pueblo, who has written critically about MOOCs, said their spread is likely to lead to a three-tiered world, with a few high-status ""super professors"" for whom the courses provide both status and royalties; a larger pool of tenured professors who continue to teach their regular in-person classes until they retire; and ""a huge army of adjuncts and teaching assistants,"" whose jobs will be vulnerable to online competition. ""The problem with this MOOC-as-labor-issue argument is that it has no place for students and learning,"" said Phil Hill, an education technology consultant. ""Our starting point ought to be what students need and whether this is an effective form of learning."" Many educators say that high-quality online materials can help students learn, just like a high-quality textbook. ""The issue in higher education is how we get to scale,"" said M. Peter McPherson, president of the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities. ""The question now is how long it's going to take for faculty members to stop saying they can use the same textbooks as others at other institutions, but they can't use the same lectures.""",A heated discussion has emerged over whether free online college classes will lead to better learning and lower costs — or to a second-class education for most students.,cb35cddb-916e-54a2-a9f2-57d5b91bc7bd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/20/us/20mooc/20mooc-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=3773f755dfa439fca9aa177cfdd404ebf82e885f0f2fd05d10ca6182d941ce46&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Daphne Koller, a Coursera founder, said there was anxiety about how online courses would affect higher education.",cb35cddb-916e-54a2-a9f2-57d5b91bc7bd,N24News/imgs/cb35cddb-916e-54a2-a9f2-57d5b91bc7bd.jpg,22
Science,Exxon Mobil Backs FuelCell Effort to Advance Carbon Capture Technology,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/science/exxon-mobil-backs-fuelcell-effort-to-advance-carbon-capture-technology.html,"For years, FuelCell Energy has been considered a company to watch. Its technology promised to help economically reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, which could help combat climate change. The Danbury, Conn., company might be able to make a difference, experts said, if only it had a partner with really deep pockets. In an agreement announced on Thursday, Exxon Mobil said it had tightened an existing relationship with FuelCell in hopes of taking the technology from the lab to the market. Any commercial development is years away, warned Vijay Swarup, vice president for research and development at Exxon Mobil Research and Engineering. But, he added, ""We think it's got the possibility to be a game changer."" Although the companies did not disclose the size of Exxon Mobil's investment in FuelCell, ""We're putting the necessary resources behind this to take the research to the next level,"" Dr. Swarup said.

The technology -- known as carbon capture and sequestration, or C.C.S.-- is an important but challenging potential solution to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The goal is to take carbon dioxide, after it is removed from exhaust steam, and to lock it away by pumping it into the ground or use it in industrial applications. Reducing the amount of carbon dioxide released by power plants could provide a bridge of sorts to the use of energy sources that do not emit greenhouse gases, said Emily A. Carter, founding director of the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment at Princeton University. While many climate activists demand an immediate shift to renewable power sources like solar and wind, ""We're going to be burning fossil fuels for the vast majority of our electricity for some time to come, whether we like it or not,"" she said. ""We desperately need C.C.S."" Carbon capture has not yet fulfilled its promise, in large part because of the enormous amounts of energy required in conventional processes to separate carbon dioxide from power plant exhaust and to compress it. Those processes greatly diminish the power output of the plant and raise the cost of the electricity produced.

What Exxon Mobil's partner brings to this thorny problem is its particular class of fuel cells -- devices that generate electricity through chemical reactions. The company's fuel cells are already used to provide clean energy in about 50 locations around the world but without a connection to fossil-fuel power plants, as envisioned in the new agreement. The fuel cells use a high-temperature molten carbonate salt mixture. Carbon dioxide flows into the fuel cell and emerges in a concentrated form that is ready for storage. It is this idea of matching up power plants, which produce carbon dioxide, with fuel cells that are hungry for it that led to a collaboration between Exxon Mobil and FuelCell that started more than four years ago. The result, at least so far in the laboratory, is that the fuel cells effectively isolate and compress the carbon dioxide while producing enough power to more than make up for the energy cost of capturing the carbon. Exxon Mobil estimates that a 500-megawatt power plant with these fuel cells could generate 120 megawatts of additional power, compared with a loss of 50 megawatts of power using conventional carbon capture technology. The company estimates that using these fuel cells with natural gas power plants could lead to a reduction of more than 90 percent in the plants' carbon dioxide emissions, while also producing large amounts of useful hydrogen.

FuelCell Energy's products can also strip 70 percent of the smog-producing oxides of nitrogen from the exhaust of coal-burning power plants. Chip Bottone, president and chief executive officer of FuelCell Energy, said he hoped the research would lead to a process that could be incorporated in power plants around the world. ""When you can make it affordable with private capital, everybody wins,"" he said. Such a high-profile effort to fight climate change could be interpreted by critics of the company as an attempt to improve the public image of Exxon Mobil at a time that it is under investigation by state attorneys general and news organizations, and attacked for its past funding of organizations that denied climate change. Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil, said that he expected activists to accuse the company of engaging in a public relations stunt to burnish its reputation, but he added, ""That's untrue."" Noting the four-year history of the work with FuelCell, he said the research would continue for years to come. Professor Carter of Princeton said, ""The idea of merging these two technologies to get something that's greater than the sum of its parts is terrific."" ""It's preliminary,"" she said of the collaboration, which she learned of before the official announcement.","The energy giant is investing in FuelCell Energy's technology for carbon capture and sequestration, a potential way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",c9eb68ae-d92b-5c26-b2a3-7b93c39e6faa,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/05/science/05CARBON/05CARBON-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=3225411526c19688a53a3511cabe040a37143b706ccfd1d2c15d99cf0b680c01&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A fuel cell used to capture and sequester carbon emissions, at the headquarters of FuelCell Energy in Danbury, Conn.",c9eb68ae-d92b-5c26-b2a3-7b93c39e6faa,N24News/imgs/c9eb68ae-d92b-5c26-b2a3-7b93c39e6faa.jpg,2
Your Money,"Less Risk, but Staying in Stocks",https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/18/your-money/stocks-and-bonds/18COLLAR.html,"EVEN after a modest stock market rebound last year, the downturns of the last decade have left portfolios bruised. Millions of investors protected themselves in the traditional  and most often ill-timed  way. They reduced their stock exposure by moving into bonds. While that provided a bit of a haven in 2008, if inflation comes back or interest rates rise, bond values will fall. Those people who have most of their money in corporate bonds or income mutual funds can lose principal. And many people time market moves badly. Diversification also failed millions of people as United States and foreign shares, and real estate investment trusts, plummeted in lockstep during the financial crisis. Under modern portfolio theory  the guiding principle behind modern money management  this was not supposed to happen. But a strategy used by professionals offers some basic portfolio protection. It uses stock options to ""collar"" stock market risks without giving up future gains.

Collar strategies limit losses when stocks drop while providing some upside potential. Options are commonly used derivatives listed on stock exchanges that are linked to specific stocks or indexes. The strategy basically involves buying a put and selling a call option on a stock that you own. The former sets a limit on how much you can lose, and the latter limits your gain if a stock rises above a certain price. Both have target or ""strike"" prices. The easiest way to employ the collar options strategy is to buy a mutual fund. The Collar Fund, whose ticker is COLLX, and the Gateway Fund, whose ticker is GATEX, are good candidates. While these funds are certainly not immune to market downturns, they do provide a fairly effective hedge. The Gateway Fund lost about 14 percent in 2008, compared with the almost 18 percent loss of its peers. The broad-based Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 37 percent that year. Michael Chamberlain, a fee-only certified financial planner based in Santa Cruz, Calif., uses the Collar Fund for his most risk-averse clients, who range in age from their 20s to 70s. ""Asset allocation used to be the primary way to limit risk,"" Mr. Chamberlain said, ""but the Collar Fund seems like a reasonable way to decrease risk while providing exposure to the stock market."" With the Collar Fund, options are bought and sold on approximately 75 stocks, representing 300 of the largest United States companies. Although it is less than a year old, its managers, Summit Portfolio Advisors, have been managing money using collar strategies in separate accounts for years. The fund charges about 1 percent annually to investors for management fees and has a $2,500 minimum investment.

Having employed options strategies since 1988, the Gateway Fund also focuses on risk-adjusted returns, but with a larger, more diversified stock portfolio. Instead of hedging a few stocks, it uses market indexes to get a bigger slice of the market. Like many hedge funds, though, Gateway will lag the broader stock market on the upside. It rose about 6.6 percent last year, compared with a 16 percent gain for the S.& P. index. It carries a 5.75 percent sales charge (for A shares), 0.94 percent in annual expenses and a 0.25 percent 12(B)1 fee. The minimum investment is $2,500. Keep in mind that neither fund can completely suit your specific needs. If you want to tailor a collar strategy to your company stock position or your specific portfolio mix, you can buy and manage options yourself or hire an investment adviser to do it for you. Collar strategies may not work as a long-term play over decades. They are most useful if you are in or near retirement and you need to hedge a large stock position. If you do not have confidence with options strategies  or do not have a full understanding how they work  the mutual funds offer a way to participate in this protective strategy. ""You need something customized to your needs,"" said Zvi Bodie, a financial economist at Boston University and a co-author of ""Worry-Free Investing"" (Financial Times Management, 2008). ""Collar funds are a safe substitute for target-date mutual funds, which don't protect you at all from the downside risk.""","""Collar"" funds can give risk-wary investors some of the potential upside of the stock market with less exposure to sharp losses.",a2928575-1801-548e-893e-d1ced515e348,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/02/18/business/18COLLAR_CA0/18COLLAR_CA0-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=315&w=600&s=790c62797bb393f9c604904433a06c053c4d062d00fa0d0242fb69154aeca14b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,SAFETY FIRST Michael Chamberlain offers collar funds to the risk-averse.,a2928575-1801-548e-893e-d1ced515e348,N24News/imgs/a2928575-1801-548e-893e-d1ced515e348.jpg,21

Music,Raphael Saadiq Finally Put His Past on the Record,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/arts/music/raphael-saadiq-jimmy-lee.html,"Raphael Saadiq's new album, ""Jimmy Lee,"" explores his personal history like never before.Credit...Peter Prato for The New York Times

From his days with the '90s R&B band Tony! Toni! Tone! through his work for Solange and Mary J. Blige, he's hesitated to bring his personal history into his music. That's changing now.

LOS ANGELES -- ""My first funeral, I was 7 years old,"" Raphael Saadiq said. ""They called my name: 'Charlie Ray Wiggins, limousine three!' I never liked limousines after that."" He was sitting in a control room at his studio, Blakeslee Recording, surrounded by totems of the past -- a trophy from the first talent show he won at Elmhurst Junior High in Oakland, Calif., an Amy Winehouse prayer candle and enough vintage guitars to stock three pawnshops. Saadiq, 53, wore a pale-blue T-shirt and periodically tugged at his twists of hair. He was talking about family and addiction and loss, about a life marked by a string of tragedies, and about why it took him until now, more than two decades into his career, to bring these stories into his music. His new album ""Jimmy Lee,"" out this week, is his first in eight years. It is named for his brother Jimmy Lee Baker, who overdosed in the 1990s after contracting H.I.V., but uses his story to tell a broader one about lives under pressure. It wasn't Saadiq's plan to make a concept album, let alone one that digs into stories this personal. But over the course of a few nights in this studio in early 2019, he began to hear the ghosts speak.

None of this has ever been a secret. Saadiq has had a tattoo of Alvie, Desmond and Jimmy's faces on his arm for 20 years. But from his time with the band he affectionately calls ""The Tonys"" up through his solo career -- four albums between 2002 and 2011, each more joyous, and consummately crafted than the last -- he's always prioritized hooks and concision over self-expression. ""My compositions had to go farther than me,"" he said. ""I just thought about delivering."" For two decades , he's done it, over and over. As a producer, he's pulled concise statements out of performers who often default to the diffuse, such as D'Angelo (""Lady"" and ""Untitled [How Does It Feel]"") and Solange (""Cranes in the Sky."") But as one of relatively few major figures of the hip-hop age who grew up playing in bands, he's just as adroit at leading from behind as a sideman, steering Mary J. Blige to an Oscar nomination (for ""Mighty River,"" from ""Mudbound"") or playing bass behind Mick Jagger on a Grammy salute to Solomon Burke. ""Raphael manages to defy time by being continuously culturally and musically relevant,"" said Rob Stringer, the chief executive of Sony Music Entertainment, which includes Columbia, the label releasing ""Jimmy Lee,"" adding, ""he always has his finger on the pulse without ever being overexposed.""

As a solo artist, Saadiq has long been a master without a masterpiece for consensus to point to. ""Jimmy Lee"" could change that through sonic ambition alone. Several tracks have an icy Europop sheen, a nod to Saadiq's past as an ""early MTV kid"" who dug Duran Duran and Level 42. The Kendrick Lamar feature ""Rearview"" finds Saadiq quavering on the chorus like David Bowie or the Pet Shop Boys' Neil Tennant. The choir on "" Rikers Island"" -- 30-plus voices railing in blunt language against the mass incarceration of black men -- is actually all Saadiq, multitracked to infinity. Saadiq has always bent time-tested pop idioms into supple, modern shapes. But he's never populated his tracks with desperate characters on the run from themselves and the world's harsh judgment, forever getting in their own way. The album title ""is a reference to everything -- I couldn't name it after all of them,"" he said, but Saadiq himself is a newly raw and vulnerable presence too. ""It's probably the most honest record I've ever made,"" he said. While he's talking about a few people on the songs, ""a lot of it relates to me. It was like a mirror.""

Charlie had been married and divorced by the time he met Edith James, Saadiq's mother. Collectively, his parents had 14 children, but Saadiq was the only child they had together. He came along late, when many of his siblings were grown. (His father would tease him, ""You were a good mistake, but you were a mistake."") As a child, Saadiq often caught a ride between his families' houses on the handlebars of his older brother Randy Wiggins' bike. ""He sang better than all of us,"" Saadiq said of Randy. ""That's how I learned about the Delfonics and the Stylistics."" Randy sang with Alvie in talent shows but never pursued music professionally, and is now retired after a long career with Kilpatrick's Bakeries in Oakland. Asked in a phone interview about the present state of his falsetto, he offered an impromptu demonstration, singing the first few bars of the Stylistics' ""Betcha by Golly Wow"" into the phone in a voice that was high and powerful. Saadiq was a child when Alvie was killed; he had more time with Jimmy Lee, a heroin addict who didn't get along with their stepfather, Ed Nelson, Saadiq said, and would sometimes break into the Nelson house and steal whatever he could. ""For me to title my album 'Jimmy Lee' -- people in my family will wonder, Why him,"" Saadiq said. Saadiq said his brother Desmond also fell into addiction and shot himself in Saadiq's father's apartment, and matter-of-factly described the family cleaning up the aftermath. ""We didn't know what to do,"" he said. ""We just did it.""

Saadiq described himself as an observant kid. Witnessing his brothers' travails informed his own decisions. Street life didn't beckon him. ""I never could have sold dope,"" Saadiq said. ""I didn't think some dude my age could be my boss and tell me what to do."" Instead, when he was still in grade school, he found his first professional music gig, backing the Gospel Messengers, who'd met as custodians at the hospital where Saadiq's mother worked. At age 9, he became the bassist of his uncle Elijah Baker's group, the Gospel Hummingbirds, and carried a stack of business cards identifying himself as such . Oakland was a musical hotbed back then . Natalie Cole's band lived around the corner from his mother's house; once, at the supermarket, a preteen Saadiq encountered his idol, Larry Graham, the Sly & the Family Stone and Graham Central Station bassist, who was shopping in platforms and leather with a Lincoln Continental parked outside. Saadiq spent hours in his room, teaching himself to play Graham's busy bass lines -- particularly ""Pow"" and ""Release Yourself,"" which Saadiq said were essentials for any bassist looking to sit in with a pickup band -- as well as songs by the Commodores and Earth, Wind & Fire. Saadiq formed Tony! Toni! Tone! with his brother D'Wayne Wiggins and the drummer Timothy Riley at the end of the '80s. Hip-hop had crews, R&B had groups, but neither one had bands; the skills they'd honed on the competitive Oakland garage-band circuit set them apart at the peak of the age of sampling. But Saadiq also sought out the Queens rappers A Tribe Called Quest and quizzed them about their gritty drum sound.

Tribe's DJ/producer Ali Shaheed Muhammad contributed to the Tonys' fourth album, ""Sons of Soul,"" and said watching them work out the song ""Couldn't Keep It to Myself"" at a recording session in Trinidad inspired him to learn an instrument. ""He just said, 'Yo, follow me,'"" Muhammad said. ""He started playing a bass line and singing -- just humming, freestyling like a rapper. I was just staring at them -- they had not said a word to each other but they all joined in and started playing."" ""Sons of Soul"" yielded the Tonys' biggest hit, the rollicking ""If I Had No Loot."" Saadiq said he effectively left the band after that, although they made one more album together in 1996. He wasn't, as he put it, ""trying to be Bobby Brown or something"" when he left. He hoped to go broader, not bigger. ""I wanted to be able to shoot from anywhere on the court,"" he said. ""I didn't think it was just singing. I didn't think it was just producing. If I was free to do anything I wanted to do? I'm my own best bet. I'll bet on me all the time."" On the 1995 soundtrack for John Singleton's ""Higher Learning,"" the newly solo Raphael Wiggins is credited for the first time as ""Raphael Saadiq."" ""I just wanted a little separation -- some branding, different from the Tonys, different from a Wiggins,"" he said. (He had become ""Raphael"" on an audition to play in Sheila E's live band in the mid-80s.) Also, he was told an executive at PolyGram asked: ""Who wants to hear an artist named Raphael Wiggins?""

Saadiq said that even D'Angelo has called him underrated. ""He says, 'Man, I don't feel like the whole world knows that you're dope,'"" Saadiq said, approximating his friend's gravelly delivery. Saadiq also said this was how he preferred it: ""People aren't watching until I hit 'em in the head with something like this album. I like to pick my punches, when I want to hit you at."" ""I've always been making music for me. Only for me,"" he continued. ""I understood how lucky and fortunate I was, for people to listen to me and like me and to buy a ticket to come see me -- I knew that was very special, because I didn't make the music for them."" So where does the satisfaction come from? ""Right here when it comes off your speakers. That is already the Grammy."" Saadiq skipped the Grammy Awards in 2017, the year Solange won for a song he helped write. When it was suggested that ""Jimmy Lee"" is the kind of record that might mandate his attendance at next year's ceremony, he laughed.","From his days with the '90s R&B band Tony! Toni!

Music,Gil Scott-Heron's Legacy Is a Work in Progress,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/arts/music/gil-scott-heron-makaya-mccraven.html,"When the drummer and producer Makaya McCraven got a call inviting him to rework Gil Scott-Heron's final record, he recognized the magnitude of the task. He knew a lot about the poet, novelist, musician and Black Arts Movement hero often called the ""godfather of rap."" But he had heard much less about the album, ""I'm New Here,"" which came out in 2010, a year before Scott-Heron's death at 62. When Mr. McCraven dug into the album, he was struck by a quandary. ""This sounds like it's already been remixed,"" he said he remembered thinking, listening to the spare, heavily electronic LP.

The string of brilliant recordings that Gil Scott-Heron made from the 1970s to the early '80s represent one of the most important runs of resistance music created by any artist in modern history -- the call-to-consciousness proto-rap anthem ""The Revolution Will Not Be Televised""; the allegorical ballad ""Winter in America."" Perhaps only Bob Marley rivals him, and Marley's music was resistance of a different sort: less politically literate, dreamier. ""I'm New Here"" was recorded in the late-aughts, in a series of trans-Atlantic sessions between Scott-Heron and the record producer Richard Russell, an executive at the record label XL, who is based in Britain. It was Scott-Heron's first album in 40 years not to feature a full band; instead it centered on the spare, gunmetal beats that Mr. Russell draped around Scott-Heron's voice, fostering a sense of both claustrophobia and remove. Mr. McCraven let those electronic tracks go. ""I wanted to support his voice, and then try to do something of my own along with it,"" he said. So he went straight for Scott-Heron's vocal stems, then brought in other young jazz musicians to record some live tracks with him. Using his trademark production approach, Mr. McCraven spliced up the music they'd laid down -- mixing in some old recordings by his father, the drummer Stephen McCraven, and ending up with a bristling crosstown junction of hip-hop, Afrobeat, European folk music and jazz. The resulting album, ""We're New Again,"" which XL will release on Friday, doesn't recreate the loose Caribbean funk sound of Scott-Heron's classic bands. Mr. McCraven's instrumentals are a cosmopolitan tangle -- founded in samples and syncretism -- that belongs firmly to the fast-advancing 21st century.

But Mr. McCraven has done some restoration work. On the original ""I'm New Here,"" the flickering gloom of Mr. Russell's production often made Scott-Heron sound cloistered and defeated, even as his poetry pulsed with its typical humor, self-effacement and vision. On ""We're New Again,"" Mr. McCraven's arrangements exhume a feeling of potential, a promise of communion -- the things that were always at Scott-Heron's creative core. Scott-Heron is heard on both albums reading his poem ""On Coming From a Broken Home,"" which celebrates the women who raised him: ""I came from what they called 'a broken home,' but if they'd ever really called at our house, they would have known how wrong they were."" On ""We're New Again,"" Mr. McCraven has combined an old recording of his mother, Agnes Zsigmondi, playing the flute while his father plays the kalimba with new tracks, including the young harpist Brandee Younger. As Scott-Heron speaks of communion with his own ancestry, the instrumentals bubble together and generations interlace. When ""I'm New Here"" came out in 2010, Scott-Heron had not released a studio album in more than 15 years, and he was in the throes of a drug addiction that he would never fully outrun. In an interview with The New Yorker shortly after its release, Scott-Heron called the album ""Richard's CD,"" saying that Mr. Russell's enthusiasm had led to the collaboration: ""All the dreams you show up in are not your own."" ""We're New Again"" strips away the electronic tracks of ""I'm New Here."" Speaking from London this week, Mr. Russell said that Scott-Heron had first insisted that both of them should claim authorship of the album, but Mr. Russell had dismissed that idea.

So maybe it makes sense to think about ""I'm New Here"" and the smattering of follow-up materials that have trickled out over the past decade (mixtapes, outtakes collections, short documentaries) as Scott-Heron himself seems to have understood the album: not as his own last solo statement, but as a collaboration, initiated and largely carried through by Russell. As the 10th anniversary of Scott-Heron's death approaches, he deserves to be remembered for the impact he made upon his own time, and its resonance across eras. Everything he put out between 1974 and 1982 is effectively out of print, and unavailable on streaming services. His children, from different romantic relationships, have been at loggerheads since his death, creating a legal knot. Still, his work is out there on YouTube, in used-record stores, and on the lips of everyone who uses the phrases he coined, whether they know it or not: ""the revolution will not be televised,"" ""home is where the hatred is."" As well as rap's godfather, it would be wise to recall that Scott-Heron -- whose work was anchored in Southern blues and the black literary canon -- was the bard of the Black Power Movement. And as that movement's push for equal access to political power remains unfinished, the insights of his poetry still bear heavily on today. ""The work is there,"" said the scholar and critic Greg Tate, who had known Scott-Heron. ""Anybody whose work has that depth -- in terms of a contemporary reckoning, it's just a matter of time. It's inevitable.""",A reimagining of his final album by the drummer and producer Makaya McCraven is another step toward a contemporary reckoning with his powerful oeuvre.,d2ff97e1-82df-5fbe-98c2-acac1ecf3743,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/06/arts/05mccraven/05mccraven-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=4860a8d60a2495dd2f5971ded1ce2877cc948705a43394fad4ff16883dcd41ed&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Gil Scott-Heron in performance.,d2ff97e1-82df-5fbe-98c2-acac1ecf3743,N24News/imgs/d2ff97e1-82df-5fbe-98c2-acac1ecf3743.jpg,12
Opinion,Why Did So Many Americans Vote for Trump?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/opinion/trump-democrats-coronavirus.html,"President Trump's disastrous mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic probably cost him re-election. Yet it seems mind-boggling that he still won more votes than any incumbent president in American history despite his dereliction of responsibility at a time of a once-in-a-century health crisis and economic devastation. Why are President-elect Joe Biden's margins so thin in the states that clinched his victory? And why did the president's down-ticket enablers flourish in the turbulent, plague-torn conditions they helped bring about? Democrats, struggling to make sense of it all, are locked in yet another round of mutual recrimination: They were either too progressive for swing voters -- too socialist or aggressive with ambitious policies like the Green New Deal -- or not progressive enough to inspire potential Democratic voters to show up or cross over. But they should understand that there was really no way to avoid disappointment. Three factors -- the logic of partisan polarization, which inaccurate polling obscured; the strength of the juiced pre-Covid-19 economy; and the success of Mr. Trump's denialist, open-everything-up nonresponse to the pandemic -- mostly explain why Democrats didn't fare better.

This shocking strategy worked for Republicans, even if it didn't pan out for the president himself. Moreover, it laid a trap that Democrats walked into -- something they should understand and adjust for, as best they can, as they look ahead. How could a president responsible for one of the gravest failures of governance in American history nevertheless maintain such rock-solid support? Democracy's throw-the-bums-out feedback mechanism gets gummed up when the electorate disagrees about the identity of the bums, what did and didn't occur on their watch and who deserves what share of the credit or blame. When party affiliation becomes a central source of meaning and self-definition, reality itself becomes contested and verifiable facts turn into hot-button controversies. Elections can't render an authoritative verdict on the performance of incumbents when partisans in a closely divided electorate tell wildly inconsistent stories about one another and the world they share.
* Mark Penn and Andrew Stein write that ""only a broader course correction to the center will give Democrats a fighting chance in 2022"" and beyond.
* Tory Gavito and Adam Jentleson write that the Virgina loss should ""shock Democrats into confronting the powerful role that racially coded attacks play in American politics.""
* Ezra Klein speaks to David Shor, who discusses his fear that Democrats face electoral catastrophe unless they shift their messaging.
* Ross Douthat writes that the outcome of the Virginia gubernatorial race shows Democrats need a ""new way to talk about progressive ideology and education."" Mr. Trump has a knack for leveraging the animosities of polarized partisanship to cleave his supporters from sources of credible information and inflame them with vilifying lies. This time, it wasn't enough to save his bacon, which suggests that polarization hasn't completely wrecked our democracy's capacity for self-correction: Sweeping a medium-size city's worth of dead Americans under the rug turned out to be too tall an order. However, Mr. Trump's relentless campaign to goose the economy by cutting taxes, running up enormous deficits and debt, and hectoring the Fed into not raising rates was working for millions of Americans. We tend to notice when we're personally more prosperous than we were a few years before.

But the president's catastrophic response to Covid-19 threw the economy into a tailspin. That is where it gets interesting -- and Democrats get uncomfortable. Mr. Trump abdicated responsibility, shifting the burden onto states and municipalities with busted budgets. He then waged a war of words against governors and mayors -- especially Democrats -- who refused to risk their citizens' lives by allowing economic and social activity to resume. He spurred his supporters to make light of the danger of infection, made the churlish refusal to wear masks into an emblem of emancipation from the despotism of experts and turned public health restrictions on businesses, schools and social gatherings into a tyrannical conspiracy to steal power by damaging the economy and his re-election prospects. He succeeded in putting Democrats on the defensive about economic restrictions and school closures. As months passed and with no new relief coming from Washington, financially straitened Democratic states and cities had little choice but to ease restrictions on businesses just to keep the lights on. That seemed to concede the economic wisdom of the more permissive approach in majority-Republican states and fed into Mr. Trump's false narrative of victory over the virus and a triumphant return to normalcy. But Democrats weren't destined to get quite as tangled in Mr. Trump's trap as they did. They had no way to avoid it, but they could have been hurt less by it. They allowed Republicans to define the contrast between the parties' approaches to the pandemic in terms of freedom versus exhausting, indefinite shutdowns. Democrats needed to present a competing, compelling strategy to counter Republican messaging. Struggling workers and businesses never clearly heard exactly what they'd get if Democrats ran the show, and Democrats never came together to scream bloody murder that Republicans were refusing to give it to them. Democrats needed to underscore the depth of Republican failure by forcefully communicating what other countries had done to successfully control the virus. And they needed to promise to do the same through something like an Operation Warp Speed for testing and P.P.E. to get America safely back in business. Instead, they whined that Mr. Trump's negligence and incompetence were to blame for America's economic woes and complained that Mitch McConnell wouldn't even consider the House's big relief bill. They weren't wrong, but correctly assigning culpability did nothing to help working-class breadwinners who can't bus tables, process chickens, sell smoothies or clean hotel rooms over Zoom.

The Republican message couldn't have been clearer: Workers should be able to show up, clock in, earn a normal paycheck, pay the rent and feed their kids. Democrats were telling the same workers that we need to listen to science, reopening is premature, and the economy can't be fully restored until we beat the virus. Correct! But how does that help when rent was due last week? Make no mistake, it was unforgivably cruel of Republicans to force blue-collar and service workers to risk death for grocery money. Yet their disinformation campaign persuaded many millions of Americans that the risk was minimal and that Democrats were keeping their workplaces and schools closed, their customers and kids at home, and their wallets empty and cupboards bare for bogus reasons. The president's mendacious push to hastily reopen everything was less compelling to college-educated suburbanites, who tend to trust experts and can work from home, watch their kids and spare a laptop for online kindergarten. Mr. Trump lost the election mainly because he lost enough of these voters, including some moderate Republicans who otherwise voted straight Republican tickets. Democrats need to rethink the idea that these voters would have put Democratic House and Senate candidates over the top if only Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez were less radiantly socialist. They need to accept that they took hits on the economy by failing to escape the trap Republicans set by doggedly refusing to do anything about the uncontained contagion destroying it. And they need to understand how Mr. Trump saved his party by weaponizing polarization. Conservatives needed a way not to get spun by the president's destabilizing act of disloyalty, so they steadied themselves by reaffirming their loyalty down the remainder of the ballot. They were voting against a personal crisis of identity, not the Green New Deal. Democrats might have done better had sunny polls and their own biased partisan perceptions not misled them into believing that backlash to indisputably damning Republican failure would deliver an easy Senate majority -- but not much better. Until the mind-bending spell of polarization breaks, everything that matters will be fiercely disputed and even the most egregious failures will continue to go unpunished.

Television,The Super Bowl Is Problematic. Why Can't We Look Away?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/arts/television/super-bowl-why-watch.html,"AUSTIN CONSIDINE Friends: I know what I'm doing Sunday. I know what you're doing Sunday. As full-time culture journalists, to ignore the Super Bowl would be a gross dereliction of duty. That's because the Super Bowl isn't just a game. It's the halftime show; it's the ads; it's the chips and guac. It is sport but also music, dance, costumes, TV production and stage design -- a pop culture event greater than the sum of its parts. Perhaps most important, it was watched last year by roughly 100 million people: In a world of on-demand entertainment, the Super Bowl is one of the last true vestiges of an era when we all watched the same things at the same time. But I, like a lot of sports fans, have struggled in recent years to reconcile what is beautiful about the game with what is ugly. First, there's the degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head hits -- not only to concussions -- which the N.F.L. actively worked to conceal. Then there are the league's troubles with domestic abuse and race. We could unpack those for days, but let it suffice to note that Tyreek Hill still has a job and Colin Kaepernick does not. Some fans have learned to tolerate the cognitive dissonance, or to square their free enjoyment with the ostensible free will of the players. Others, like me, have trouble shouldering our complicity with football's worst elements and have mostly stopped watching. But regardless, fans or not, we mostly show up for the Super Bowl. Why is that?

WESLEY MORRIS Austin, I, too, have consumed less football in the last five years because the hits can be hard to watch, because the punitive, allegedly apolitical stances of the league are themselves paradoxically political. There are many amazing physical achievements in this sport. There's endless ridiculousness. The choreographed end-zone celebration, for instance, has gleefully migrated to other sports. And the league, in spite of itself, has a muscular charitable wing. This is to say that loving the N.F.L. means putting up with a lot. But its outsize popularity also seems a partial answer to the moral riddle that's so openly vexed us these past two or three years. How do we enjoy the work of bad, unpleasant, corrupt people and institutions? Of criminals? Does opting into the Super Bowl experience then condone the problems of football? Can spectatorship be anything but an endorsement? It's the conundrum of a capitalist society to the extent that it's truly a conundrum at all.

CARYN GANZ Football is the quintessential problematic fave. And like Michael Jackson, it's too challenging to cancel, too big to fail, too embedded in the fabric of American leisure to rip out. (For now, at least.) The Super Bowl is drama, emotion, identity, catharsis, spectacle, skill, power: It's nearly impossible to find a viewer beyond its scope. It's no longer possible to keep up with everything happening in television, movies, music and digital media, but the Super Bowl is one of the last gasps of the monoculture. It's a given and a gimme: It has almost no barrier for entry -- one network channel, one block of time when nobody is expected to be doing anything other than watching the Super Bowl. And as for the ethical conundrum, ethics are under siege in every corner of our society: on social media, in Washington, in college admissions, on the music charts. In an era of ""LOL nothing matters,"" where does football rank on the scale of horrors? Even if your answer is ""quite high,"" there are 100 million other viewers willing to share the shame.

MORRIS Caryn, don't play. You know I know Madonna's set list from that night. I also remember how the emotional properties of the Boston bar where I watched that game completely changed as her halftime show began. The Patriots were about to lose another Super Bowl to the Giants, and even though they were up (by a point) going into the second half, that woman and her friends seemed to lighten the mood. Men were mouthing along to ""Open Your Heart."" But they were also happy to partake in the spectacle of a 53-year-old imposing her sexual-identity gender circus (a phalanx of beefcake transported her to the stage) upon a sport whose stated orientation points, non-negotiably, one way. This is to say that the halftime show can be received multiple ways at once. It's an event complicit in all that dismays us about American football as a whole and the N.F.L. especially: players' physical and mental health; compensation and exploitation; the sanctioned conflation with the league and our military; the names. Kansas City's excellent Super Bowl team is the Chiefs; and when fans are feeling confidently vicious, half the arms in the stadium begin to tomahawk chop. (They're not the so-called Redskins, and yet the team brings with it many centuries of terrible history anytime it plays -- anytime its ""merch"" is sold.)

But the halftime show is also an event wholly outside the problems of the sport. Its stars have been imported and occasionally seem eager to practice subversion, as Madonna and Beyonce have; to practice an exuberant nothing, as Katy Perry has. It is what its stars fight for it to be. I'm enormously excited to see what J. Lo and Shakira have fought for. We are, though, at a really fascinating place now. An aspect of the culture is asking these entertainers to consider what it means to partake in an event that could feature any number of problematic figures. (Tyreek Hill is a star Chief.) And on Madonna's night, in 2012, Aaron Hernandez scored one of the Patriots' touchdowns. In 2013, he was charged with (and later found guilty of) shooting and killing a man. GANZ Halftime may hover in a space outside the problems of the sport, but it has its own crises related to football's troubled racial and gender dynamics. Consider how the Super Bowl completely reshaped Janet Jackson's career. Jackson had five No. 1 albums and was known as one of the biggest pop stars on the planet, but less than three seconds in 2004 -- so-called ""Nipplegate,"" when her bare breast was exposed by Justin Timberlake during the last moments of their performance -- rewrote her entire history, plunging her into years of purgatory. It only briefly affected Timberlake's, since he has the luxury of being white and male. (Remember, he returned to headline halftime in 2018.) CONSIDINE Does making Jennifer Lopez and Shakira the halftime show headliners -- a first for Latinas -- feel like a transparent scramble by the N.F.L. to virtue-signal? To be more charitable, it makes sense that the league might simply want to pay tribute to the Hispanic heritage of this year's host city, Miami. But wasn't the N.F.L. probably compelled to do something extra after the outspoken way in which multiple artists last year turned down the opportunity in support of Colin Kaepernick? And after Rihanna did the same this season?

GANZ Sports and music are two arenas in which the stars are mostly young and black but work in a structure still largely controlled by older white men. The idea that some of the most powerful players in the music industry shunned halftime last year is a compelling one. (Maroon 5 agreed to perform and paid some sort of karmic tax.) This year is the first under the partnership between Jay-Z's Roc Nation and the league, an attempt to smooth over tensions and bring a crumb of social-justice work to the game. And it's interesting that this year's headliners are both Latin pop stars, and neither black nor rappers. The halftime show hasn't had a black headliner since Beyonce in 2013; the closest it's come to a hip-hop headliner is the Black Eyed Peas. If football fans are perceived to be so conservative they'd switch the channel rather than watch rappers, why hasn't country music ever been very welcome at halftime? Its last appearance came 17 years ago with Shania Twain.

CONSIDINE The dearth of country music at halftime is interesting when you consider that the singer most associated with the N.F.L. in recent years has been Carrie Underwood -- and before that, Hank Williams Jr. For that reason, I suspect that country music wouldn't actually be unwelcome by most football fans at halftime. I'm also interested in a reverse question: Why has non-country music always been welcome? My guess is that with the exception of one Trump-fueled moment in which some conservative fans skipped a game or two, the league knows it has that demographic locked down, no matter who performs at halftime. The billing, then, is a chance for the N.F.L. to snag some extra eyeballs, and pop is a surefire way to do it. In racial or political terms, I'll wager many of those fans who objected to Kaepernick's knee-taking fancy themselves quite open-minded -- or at least magnanimously indifferent -- regarding the race or style of the performers, same as with the players. If I'm right, then the N.F.L. risks little in ignoring those fans' musical preferences for 15 minutes. Intolerant people make low-stakes claims to tolerance all the time. But that tolerance reveals its limits when, say, a black man takes a knee. MORRIS Colin Kaepernick and Michael Bennett and their fellow protesting players knelt for ideals that I, too, believe in. Pleas for justice and equality are controversial coming only from black athletes expected -- hired -- to run, throw, catch and dunk. But the culture has moved past the protests. Kaepernick still has a sports job of sorts. He works for Nike. Meanwhile, the Super Bowl remains this idyllic vestige of who we thought we were. It's Americana that like lots of Americana is built on a cemetery of sorts. We flock to it as we do because it's a spectatorship department store -- sports, ads, music. A lot of us remember the alleged simpler times when it was easier to pretend that entertainment was all it was. On one Sunday, we can pause Everything Else and just enjoy a miraculous helmet catch or a commercial for a job-finding company. It's also a stable structure. We all know it. We know it will never change and therefore never challenge most people to confront more than their losing team. There's no M.C. to be urbane or smug or real. Setting aside the violence at its center, it's safe, a haven from so much. History in the making but also passionately ahistorical. Americana on the one hand, sure. But also just America.","The halftime show, the ads, the parties: The Super Bowl is more than a game, and 100 million of us tune in despite the sport's uglier controversies.

Technology,Facebook to Pay $550 Million to Settle Facial Recognition Suit,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/technology/facebook-privacy-lawsuit-earnings.html,"Facebook said on Wednesday that it had agreed to pay $550 million to settle a class-action lawsuit over its use of facial recognition technology in Illinois, giving privacy groups a major victory that again raised questions about the social network's data-mining practices. The case stemmed from Facebook's photo-labeling service, Tag Suggestions, which uses face-matching software to suggest the names of people in users' photos. The suit said the Silicon Valley company violated an Illinois biometric privacy law by harvesting facial data for Tag Suggestions from the photos of millions of users in the state without their permission and without telling them how long the data would be kept. Facebook has said the allegations have no merit. Under the agreement, Facebook will pay $550 million to eligible Illinois users and for the plaintiffs' legal fees. The sum dwarfs the $380.5 million that the Equifax credit reporting agency agreed this month to pay to settle a class-action case over a 2017 consumer data breach. Facebook disclosed the settlement as part of its quarterly financial results, in which it took a charge on the case. The sum amounted to a rounding error for Facebook, which reported that revenue rose 25 percent to $21 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with a year earlier, while profit increased 7 percent to $7.3 billion.

David Wehner, Facebook's chief financial officer, noted in an earnings call with investors that the settlement added to the social network's rising general and administrative costs, which increased 87 percent from a year ago. ""We decided to pursue a settlement as it was in the best interest of our community and our shareholders to move past this matter,"" a Facebook spokesman said in a statement.

Jay Edelson, a lawyer whose firm represented Facebook users in the facial recognition suit, said the settlement underscored the importance of strong privacy legislation. ""From people who are passionate about gun rights to those who care about women's reproductive issues, the right to participate in society anonymously is something that we cannot afford to lose,"" Mr. Edelson said.

The privacy settlement coincides with heightened public concern over the spread of powerful surveillance technology like facial recognition. Companies like Amazon and Clearview AI are marketing face-matching software to law enforcement agencies to help them identify unknown suspects. The American Civil Liberties Union and other groups have warned that the spread of such services could end people's ability to remain anonymous in public. The case also illustrates the protections that strong state laws may offer consumers. Of the three states that have stand-alone biometric privacy laws, Illinois has the most comprehensive one. It requires companies to obtain written permission before collecting a person's fingerprints, facial scans or other identifying biological characteristics. The law also gives residents the right to sue companies for up to $5,000 per violation, which could add up to billions of dollars in payouts for tech giants that lose such class-action suits.

""The Illinois law has real teeth. It pretty much stopped Facebook in its tracks,"" said Marc Rotenberg, the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit group that filed a brief in the Facebook case. ""Tech firms and other companies that collect biometric data must be very nervous right now."" Since the Illinois law was enacted in 2008, it has vexed companies that market voice assistants, doorbell cameras, photo labeling and other technology that may collect biometric details from people without their knowledge or consent. Many of the companies have argued that people should not be able to sue over violations of a consumer privacy law if they cannot prove they suffered concrete harms like financial losses. Facebook made similar claims in the facial recognition lawsuit, including in a petition in December asking the United States Supreme Court to review the case. The Supreme Court last week denied Facebook's appeal. But last January, in a case against an amusement park that had collected and stored a child's fingerprints, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that violating a person's biometric privacy could constitute a harm in and of itself, enabling consumers to pursue privacy claims. An appeals court judge later issued a similar ruling in the Facebook case, denying the company's bid to have the lawsuit dismissed.

""Courts have recognized that the very loss of control over this highly sensitive, highly personal information itself causes harm to people,"" said Nathan Wessler, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, which also filed a brief in the Facebook case. Facebook has been dogged by complaints over its use of facial recognition since 2010, when it rolled out Tag Suggestions as the default option for users. People could turn it off, but privacy experts said the company had neither obtained users' opt-in consent for the technology nor explicitly informed them that it could benefit by, for instance, using scans of their photos to improve its face-matching technology. In 2012, Facebook deactivated the technology in Europe after regulators there raised questions about its consent system. Last year, as part of a $5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over privacy violations, Facebook agreed to provide ""clear and conspicuous notice"" about its face-matching software and obtain additional permission from people before using it for new purposes they had not agreed to. In 2018, Facebook reintroduced facial recognition as an option for users in Europe. Last year, Facebook updated its facial recognition notices and settings for certain users, providing more details on how it uses the technology.","It was another black mark on the privacy record of the social network, which also reported its quarterly earnings.",76626a42-1f3e-5a78-a1d3-718d06ab6bf9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/29/business/29facebook/29facebook-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=22dcc642ea4db8dbfd426d4a30ddd18df63e858579fa8a097da7181600017047&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A class-action lawsuit accused Facebook of violating an Illinois privacy law.,76626a42-1f3e-5a78-a1d3-718d06ab6bf9,N24News/imgs/76626a42-1f3e-5a78-a1d3-718d06ab6bf9.jpg,20
Health,Bulwark Against an Abortion Ban? Medical Advances,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/01/science/abortion-supreme-court-trump.html,"As partisans on both sides of the abortion divide contemplate a Supreme Court with two Trump appointees, one thing is certain: America even without legal abortion would be very different from America before abortion was legal. The moment Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced his retirement, speculation swirled that Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that legalized abortion, would be overturned. Most legal experts say that day is years away, if it arrives at all. A more likely scenario, they predict, is that a rightward-shifting court would uphold efforts to restrict abortion, which would encourage some states to further limit access. Even then, a full-fledged return to an era of back-alley, coat-hanger abortions seems improbable. In the decades since Roe was decided, a burst of scientific innovation has produced more effective, simpler and safer ways to prevent pregnancies and to stop them after conception -- advances that have contributed to an abortion rate that has already plunged by half since the 1980s. ""We're in a new world now,"" said Aziza Ahmed, a law professor at Northeastern University who writes about reproductive rights law. ""The majority of American women are on some form of contraception. We take it for granted that we can control when and how we want to reproduce. We see pregnancy as within the realm that we can control.""

Women have powerful tools at hand: improved intrauterine devices and hormonal implants that can prevent pregnancy for years at a time; inexpensive home pregnancy tests able to detect pregnancy very early; and morning-after pills, some even available over the counter, which can prevent pregnancy if taken up to five days after unprotected sex. Medication abortions enable women up to 10 weeks pregnant to take two pills, the first supervised by a doctor and the second at home, to terminate a pregnancy without surgery. In 2013, nearly a quarter of abortions were accomplished with medication, up from 10 percent in 2004. Even in countries that have banned virtually all abortions, including some in Latin America, women have managed to get these drugs from websites and abortion rights organizations that ship them. And the Affordable Care Act, which has so far defied repeated repeal attempts, has made birth control available to poor and working-class women, and also to those with private coverage through employers, with its requirement that most insurers cover the full cost of contraception. Apps and telemedicine services are making birth control pills and other methods available without even a visit to a doctor. Still, legal changes that make abortion less available would have profound effects on millions of women, disproportionately affecting African-Americans, Latinas and women struggling economically. And access to contraception can be problematic for low-income single women in the 19 states, including Texas and Florida, that have still not expanded Medicaid coverage for poor single adults.

A report this year by a committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine found that three-quarters of women who have abortions are poor or low-income, and 61 percent are women of color. Such women bear the brunt of state laws that restrict abortion, including those requiring multiple appointments or waiting periods or that limit which providers can perform abortions. Such hurdles and delays could eventually threaten the consistently high level of safety in abortion procedures, experts said. ""We found that more and more regulations on abortion and abortion procedures reduced the quality of care,"" said the committee's co-chairwoman, Dr. Helene Gayle, president and chief executive of the Chicago Community Trust. ""The people most impacted are the immigrant women already under siege, low-income women, women of color, transgender and queer women,"" said Jessica Gonzalez-Rojas, executive director of the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, which works with women in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. ""Having a Supreme Court friendly to these restrictive laws makes it a de facto ban on that kind of health care, abortion and contraception. Legal access without real access is not access at all."" In some states, though, the impact of anti-abortion laws can be hard to measure. A recent report on 2014 data by the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights, found that while the national abortion rate had reached its lowest since the Roe v. Wade decision, the rate rose modestly in six states -- five of which had introduced restrictive abortion laws. The report also found that in states where the number of abortion clinics had increased, women were not necessarily having more abortions. New Jersey went from having 24 clinics in 2011 to 41 in 2014, but abortions declined from about 47,000 to about 44,000 during that time. Overall, abortion rates have declined almost steadily since 1981, when the rate was 29.3 per 1,000 women. In 2014, there were an estimated 926,200 abortions -- a rate of 14.6 per 1,000 women, ages 15 to 44.

The so-called Comstock obscenity laws, passed from 1873 through the early 1900s, made it illegal to give, sell, mail or transport any item used for contraception or abortion. After that, ""Margaret Sanger built a movement by compromising,"" Dr. Gordon said. ""They would campaign for legalization of contraception but not abortion."" Even after the birth control pill went on the market in 1960, contraceptives were only provided to women who were married. ""When I was in college, there was a wedding ring that was shared among young women when they wanted to see a doctor to get contraception,"" Dr. Gordon said. Abortions were often arranged through networks of clergy or women who helped people find, travel to and pay for providers.

Johanna Schoen, a professor at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., who specializes in the history of women's reproductive health, said the fate and rate of abortion will be intertwined with the availability of contraception, and whether anti-abortion political forces also take aim at birth control. Professor Schoen said many European countries have low abortion rates because birth control and sex education are widely available. ""But in the United States, the same people who are trying to restrict abortions have tried to restrict contraception, too."" Carol Sanger, who teaches reproductive rights at Columbia Law School, predicts that the Supreme Court won't overrule Roe v. Wade anytime soon. Developing a case that would be a direct assault takes years, she said. ""You don't say, 'Kennedy's out, Roe's overturned,'"" Ms. Sanger said. The doctrine of precedent, known as stare decisis, ""to stand by things decided,"" is sturdy. Circumstances must be extraordinary, a law unworkable, for a court to overrule itself, Ms. Sanger said. ""It stands for the idea that the substance of our law doesn't blow back and forth just because we get a new administration."" Another reason Roe v. Wade may not be struck down? ""You can do a heck of a lot of damage without overturning it,"" she said.

Among such initiatives, said Susan Swayze Liebel of the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion organization, ""fetal pain"" laws have become a ""top priority."" Some 20 states have enacted these laws, which assert that a fetus can feel pain at 20 weeks after conception -- a claim refuted by most medical experts. Roe barred most legal restrictions on abortions until fetuses were considered able to survive outside the womb, believed then to be 24 weeks after a woman's last menstrual period (about 22 weeks after conception). These laws seek to shorten abortion deadlines by two weeks, and while more than 90 percent of abortions occur much earlier, in the first trimester, fetal pain laws serve as potent political rallying cries. Numerous lawsuits about abortion restrictions are currently in state and federal courts, primed to wound Roe with a thousand cuts. Like the fetal pain laws, the intention of one such category is to roll back viability dates, which goes to the heart of Roe. Iowa just enacted a law banning most abortions after six weeks, when a fetal heartbeat can be detected. Mississippi recently passed a ban on abortions after 15 weeks. Abortion providers swiftly sued after the laws were passed. Legislators who sponsored the laws said they relished such court clashes, hoping to reach the Supreme Court. Another category is TRAP laws: targeted regulation of abortion providers. An Arkansas law, for example, requires providers of medication abortions to have a contract with an obstetrician/gynecologist with hospital admitting privileges. The Supreme Court declined to consider an appeal by the plaintiffs, Planned Parenthood of Arkansas and Eastern Oklahoma, of an appellate court ruling that upheld the law. The clinics say finding such doctors who will work with them has been impossible. The case is back in federal court, where a judge has blocked the law until July 2. If the law takes effect, Arkansas will likely lose two of its three clinics. Another cluster of laws aims to limit abortions based on possible reasons for having them, including sex selection and fetal diagnoses of conditions such as Down syndrome. Indiana's version, signed by then-Governor Mike Pence in 2016, was recently struck down by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, 2-1. As abortion court battles unfold, both sides say they will redouble their political efforts. Noting that the Senate this year did not pass a 20-week abortion ban, Mrs. Liebel of Susan B. Anthony's List said, ""The focus for our political activity is to go door-to-door in seven states and flip some key Senate seats to be pro-life."" And Nancy Northup, president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which focuses on laws concerning reproductive freedom, noted that some eight states have enshrined the right to abortion, should Roe fall. ""So we are also looking at advocacy alternatives, such as friendlier state laws and federal legislation to protect women's health,"" she said.",Improved contraception and abortion pills mean the back-alley days are largely gone. But more restrictive abortion laws would especially affect poor and minority women.,d738318e-e996-530e-a2c0-07d0d228d946,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/02/science/02-jp-abortion-print/00ABORTION1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=6310b0ae12a89321851761265b4968653363f88f20ee91e76b15bae884dda816&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A march in Washington of women demanding legalization of abortion in 1971.

Science,"When a Pregnant Pipefish Dad Spots an Alluring Female, Things Get Weird",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/science/pipefish-abort-pregnancies.html,"Pipefish, along with their cousins sea horses and sea dragons, defy convention in love and fertility. In a striking role reversal, fathers give birth instead of mothers. During courtship, females pursue males with flashy ornaments or elaborate dances, and males tend to be choosy about which females' eggs they'll accept. Once pregnant, these gender-bending fathers invest heavily in their young, supplying embryos with nutrients and oxygen through a setup similar to the mammalian placenta. But this investment may also be cruelly conditional, according to a new study in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Studying pipefish, scientists found evidence that pregnant fathers spontaneously abort or divert fewer resources to their embryos when faced with the prospects of a superior mate -- in this case, an exceptionally large female. The researchers named their finding the ""woman in red"" effect, after the eponymous 1984 Gene Wilder film about a married man's obsession with a woman in a red dress that becomes damaging to his family life.

[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The reported effect is an interesting instance of sexual conflict, which is ubiquitous among animals, said Sarah Flanagan, a pipefish expert at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. If you're a romantic, you might think of mating as harmonious. But in nature, reproduction is more often a vicious power struggle between mothers and fathers with competing interests. A maternal analogue to the ""woman in red"" effect occurs among mice. Males are willing to kill a female's offspring, if they are unrelated to him, before mating with her. In anticipation, a pregnant mother may terminate her pregnancy when exposed to a new male, rather than spending resources on doomed offspring.

This behavior, named the Bruce effect (for Hilda Bruce, the British zoologist), has been documented in lions, horses and monkeys, too, but a similar strategy has never been reported apart from mammals until now, said Nuno Monteiro, a researcher at the CIBIO Research Center in Biodiversity and Genetic Resources in Portugal and an author of the new study.

Though pipefish don't commit infanticide, Dr. Monteiro wondered whether they experienced something similar to the Bruce effect because pregnancies are so costly for males. Previous research had found that pipefish fathers invest less in pregnancies from small females if they have bred with larger females before. At the risk of anthropomorphizing, Dr. Flanagan said, it's as if male pipefish are thinking, ""I've done better in the past."" In their study, Dr. Monteiro and his collaborators bred male black-striped pipefish with large females, then kept each father-to-be in a tank partitioned from a new female of equal size, a new female much larger in size (the woman in red), or its original mate. Males in the ""woman in red"" group -- exposed to the new, ""sexier"" female -- had the highest rates of abortion and shortest pregnancies. They also birthed smaller offspring, some of which had abnormalities. It seems that these fathers stopped investing in existing offspring to save up for a better brood, said Jacinta Beehner, an associate professor of psychology and anthropology at the University of Michigan who studies reproductive strategies in primates. In fact, because pipefish fathers are known to absorb nutrients from aborted embryos (essentially cannibalizing their young), they should be able to reallocate energy from abandoned pregnancies toward future ones, Dr. Monteiro said.",This is not a happy love story.,544dda13-cb0c-5ce0-8ace-4758f6901600,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/28/science/25TB-PIPEFISH1/25TB-PIPEFISH1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=37ecf663a79e5ee972ce17a813695eec584efc9a3c02bafb5c59e540e253c540&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A robust ghost pipefish in waters off Indonesia.

Books,"'Kitchen Confidential,' First Published in 2000, Tops the List Again",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/books/review/kitchen-confidential-anthony-bourdain-best-seller.html,"It's probably no surprise that for the second week in a row, ""Kitchen Confidential"" -- 's profane, raunchy, freewheeling memoir about the inner workings of a restaurant kitchen -- tops two of our nonfiction best-seller lists: paperback and combined e-book & print.

When ""Kitchen Confidential"" was first published 18 years ago, The Times gave it a rave, saying that ""Bourdain gleefully rips through the scenery to reveal private backstage horrors little dreamed of by the trusting public"" and describing his style as a mishmash of Hunter S. Thompson, Iggy Pop and Jonathan Swift. Bourdain explained, in frankly unappetizing detail, why diners should never order fish on Monday or ask for well-done meat, and he called the re-use of bread an ""industry-wide practice,"" adding, ""once in a while some tubercular hillbilly has been coughing and spraying in the general direction of that bread basket.""

Though ""Kitchen Confidential"" (aptly subtitled ""Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly"") has never gone out of print, demand for it soared after Bourdain's suicide in France on June 8; many bookstores sold out, causing Bourdain's paperback publisher, Ecco, to scramble a bit. ""We actually keep quite a bit of stock of this title on hand because it's always been a consistent seller for us week in and week out,"" Ecco's associate publisher, Miriam Parker, says. ""Our inventory team also reacted swiftly and ordered a large reprint immediately upon the unexpected and heartbreaking news.""

Given the glut of beach reads published every summer, the fiction list is usually in flux by late June. This week, though, it remains largely unchanged, with Bill Clinton and James Patterson's thriller, ""The President Is Missing,"" still lodged at No. 1 -- where Knopf and Little, Brown fervently hope it stays, given the size of the advance they shelled out.

Dance,Choreographers Who Dare to Risk Boredom in the Name of Insight,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/02/arts/dance/choreographers-who-dare-to-risk-boredom-in-the-name-of-insight.html,"At the Berlin Conference of 1884-85, European powers met to divvy up Africa. In ""2065 BC,"" the Adham Hafez Company imagines a similar conference, decades from now, in which power is reversed and African queens set out a new world order. The Adham Hafez Company is based in Cairo, where, considering the recent history of Egypt, fantasies of the future must seem both tantalizing and treacherous. The extreme difficulties of creating independent theater there are not hard to imagine. These conditions make the intellectual energy fueling ""2065 BC"" more remarkable and excuse some of the production's clumsiness. The work had its United States premiere on Wednesday as part of New York Live Arts' Live Ideas series, which is devoted to cultural transformation in the Middle East and North Africa. For much of the show, most of the four women who make up the cast sit at a table stacked with papers as one of them delivers a speech at a podium. Periodically the women communicate in a kind of sign language or move in choreography reminiscent of flight attendants' explaining safety features, but the production is largely inert.

Its strengths are verbal and vocal. Even through the distortion of heavy reverb, the four women (Mona Gamil, Alaa Abdellateef, Salma Abdel Salam and Charlene Ibrahim) do pitch-perfect imitations of politicians and diplomats. In its parody of political speech, the script can be clever, with multi-sided ironies. The globe-spanning imperial titles of the new world order (""Her Majesty the Queen of Liberia and the American West Coast"") sound as absurd, and dangerous, as those of the old. The names of participants in a ""cabaret for the colonies"" scroll in an amusing list: Scarlett O'Sahara, Guantanamo Babe.

But these bits are scattered in an uneven series of sketches piled and paper-clipped together like the documents on the table. The show's twin political preoccupations of colonialism and gender often split apart, and the successive segments, sometimes separating into just sound or just film, are widely spaced, as if Mr. Hafez didn't trust his audience to process more than one idea or sensation at a time. Instead, for large swaths of the nearly two-hour duration, he seems determined to make viewers experience the terrible boredom of any political conference, even one that upends the world. Boredom is also risked in ""-55,"" a solo that the Moroccan choreographer Raduoan Mriziga performed at New York Live Arts on Thursday. In street clothes, he executes a series of tasks, eventually creating an intricate design on the floor with chalk and tape. The title tells you how many minutes it takes. Since 2008, Mr. Mriziga has lived and worked in Brussels, where he attended the influential school P.A.R.T.S. ""-55,"" his first work, seems to be in a familiar mode of Euro-American postmodernism. The initial motions -- walking, arm swinging, lying on his back -- are pedestrian, though lightly decorated with snaps, claps, curlicues and hand-to-foot suggestions of folk dance. Segments repeat, in different orientations. In addition to the body percussion, sound comes from five cassette decks placed (as is the audience) on four sides surrounding Mr. Mriziga. The sound is highly fragmentary, as if mostly erased. When Mr. Mriziga lays out his floor geometry, he measures its proportions with his body: a line twice his height, a circle traced from the turning point of an elbow with the radius of a forearm.

It's interesting enough to watch him at work. The finished picture is like a cathedral's rose window made in the manner of Leonardo's Vitruvian Man. But what's more absorbing is the dawning realization that so many of the random-seeming motions of the solo's first part were actually rehearsals of functional components in the creation of the diagram. It's surprising that design should govern in motions so plain.",The Adham Hafez Company and Raduoan Mriziga presented works as part of New York Live Arts' Live Ideas series.,efb07b96-2f07-54ac-bfb7-559878db594f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/02/arts/02IDEAS/02IDEAS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=4b96486ce6f18f0e1beefe61201ace6ac5e1791abeb36b2361cd88a08c4983a5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Mona Gamil and Salma Abdel Salam of Adham Hafez Company.,efb07b96-2f07-54ac-bfb7-559878db594f,N24News/imgs/efb07b96-2f07-54ac-bfb7-559878db594f.jpg,6
Media,"Inside Fox News, 'There Are People in Tears'",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/22/business/media/inside-fox-news-there-are-people-in-tears.html,"For hundreds of Fox News employees gathered in Cleveland for the Republican National Convention, the abrupt resignation of Roger Ailes came as a disorienting shock. Mr. Ailes, who dominated the network for two decades, is facing multiple allegations of sexual harassment by women who worked at Fox, including Gretchen Carlson, the former anchor who sued Mr. Ailes this month. On Thursday in Cleveland, hours before covering the convention's final night, several Fox anchors who were close to Mr. Ailes broke their silence about his departure and its impact on the network. The anchors mostly demurred when asked directly about the allegations against Mr. Ailes, whose ouster has been celebrated by critics who say he created a hostile environment for women.

""Roger Ailes is the best boss I've had in almost a half a century in journalism. I admired him tremendously professionally, and loved him personally. He and Rupert came up with the idea of Fox in the beginning, and as sad as I am for Roger to go, I can't think of a better person to keep the vision of Fox News going than Rupert. ... I intend to stay at Fox and work for Rupert as hard and as loyally as I did for Roger. ""There are people in tears. I shed mine a couple of days ago when the stories started to come out, that made this day seem like it was likely. I never knew a boss who transmitted a sense of mission, a team of common purpose, more than Roger did. And the thing that's different from any place I ever worked is, people feel a personal connection to Roger, and I think a lot of people feel a deep sense of personal loss."" 'I Don't Think It's Going to Change Much' Bret Baier, chief political anchor, whose family is close to Mr. Ailes:

""I think it's very sad, to be honest. It was tough, but we have a job to do. It's a big night tonight, we had a big night last night. We've all worked with and for Rupert for a long time, and so in one sense it will be a continuation. But in another sense, it feels bad. And it's a bad feeling. Roger was always great to me, and my family, I've always talked about that, and it's tough to see him go. ""It's a mixture of dealing with the reality of this news and the sadness of it, and the import and the big job that we have tonight. ... We'll deal with how to work in this new atmosphere day-to-day. I don't think it's going to change much from my perspective, as what I do every day. I think a lot of what we do on the news side is bottom-up, and it's always been that way. I'm betting that Rupert is going to continue that exact same process."" Asked about the allegations against Mr. Ailes, Mr. Baier said: ""I don't know all the stuff that's out there. I don't know what they're dealing with; I haven't seen or heard anything. I know the Roger I know.""
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution.

Global Business,China Imposes New Tariffs on U.S. Vehicles,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/15/business/global/china-imposes-new-tariffs-on-some-vehicles-from-the-us.html,"GUANGZHOU, China -- The Chinese government increased trade tensions with the Obama administration Wednesday evening by unexpectedly imposing antidumping and antisubsidy tariffs on imports of sport utility vehicles and midsize and large cars from the United States. The new tariffs, totaling up to nearly 22 percent of the import prices, will probably have a mainly symbolic function, rather than reducing the already skimpy sales of such vehicles in China. Other tariffs and taxes already in place have limited sales of American imports by helping raise their retail prices by about three times what the same cars and S.U.V.'s sell for in the United States. Still, firing a trade volley at American exports of automobiles, one of the most politically sensitive industries in international trade, can only escalate trade hostilities between China and the United States. China's move drew immediate criticism from the Obama administration. ""We are very disappointed in this action by China,"" said Carol Guthrie, a spokeswoman for the Office of the United States Trade Representative. ""We will be discussing this latest action with both our stakeholders and Congress to determine the best course going forward.""

The Commerce Ministry of China, which has conducted a two-year trade investigation of the American imports, gave no explanation for its decision to impose the duties. Ministry officials could not be reached for elaboration Wednesday evening. The duties would mainly affect General Motors, which exports Cadillac S.U.V.'s and cars to China; Chrysler, which exports Jeeps; the BMW Group of Germany, which exports BMW S.U.V.'s from South Carolina; and Daimler of Germany, which exports Mercedes S.U.V.'s from a factory in Alabama. Because of the high Chinese tariffs and taxes already in place, the vehicles are sold only in the thousands or even hundreds in China, and only to the most affluent. (A Jeep Grand Cherokee that begins at $27,490 at dealerships in the United States costs $85,000 or more in China.) The White House announced last week that it would ask the World Trade Organization next Monday to open an inquiry into Chinese restrictions on imports of American broiler chickens. More significantly, Chinese government agencies and companies have been furious about a current American investigation into whether Chinese solar panels exported to the United States might have received illegal subsidies or been dumped in the American market at prices below the cost of manufacturing them.

American officials have previously examined the methodology of China's two-year-old antidumping and antisubsidy investigation of American-made automobiles and have found ""significant problems,"" said Ms. Guthrie, the United States trade spokeswoman. One challenge for China, which recently celebrated its 10th anniversary as a member of the World Trade Organization, is whether Wednesday's action will be allowed under W.T.O. rules. The trade organization places many limits on a member nation's ability to impose antidumping and antisubsidy measures, particularly on goods from countries that the W.T.O. has declared as having market economies, like the United States. ""Dumping"" might be hard to demonstrate, given that the prices of the American vehicles -- even before China's tariff and tax markups -- tend to be higher than in the United States. The Chinese accusation of subsidies may be linked to previous comments by Chinese officials questioning whether the Obama administration provided too much federal assistance to G.M. and Chrysler two years ago during the global financial crisis.
* The Fed's preferred measure of inflation surged again in October amid rising food and energy prices.
* Stocks slip as interest rates rise, while jobless claims drop to their lowest point since 1969. China started the automotive trade case two days after President Obama imposed steep tariffs on surging imports of Chinese tires in September 2009. After an inquiry, the W.T.O. ruled this autumn that the American tariffs on tire imports had complied with international trade rules.

The ministry separately imposed additional antisubsidy duties of 12.9 percent for G.M. and 6.2 percent for Chrysler. The ministry's statement said that all of the new duties would be calculated on vehicle prices that include China's existing 25 percent import tariff for all family vehicles. So buyers will effectively pay the new antidumping and antisubsidy taxes on other Chinese taxes in addition to paying the new taxes on the value of the car. China's import tariff is much higher than those of other big auto manufacturing nations. The United States, for example, assesses a tariff of 2.5 percent on imported cars, minivans and S.U.V.'s. The new Chinese duties will apply to sport utility vehicles and cars with engines of 2.5 liters or greater that are imported from the United States. The duties will be in place for two years, through Dec. 14, 2013, according to the ministry's announcement. BMW said that it anticipated little effect from the duties, Daimler said that it was studying them, and Chrysler had no immediate comment. General Motors said in a statement that it was ""working with relevant authorities to understand the impact of the Chinese government's decision."" G.M. added that it would ""seek a solution consistent with a constructive global trade environment, which we believe is important to both China and the U.S.""

G.M. is a leading producer of automobiles in China, through a series of joint ventures with Chinese partners. The company's statement said that imports from the United States represented ""less than half of 1 percent of its domestic production in China."" By contrast, Chrysler's sales in China are solely imports. The company was not allocated any factories in China when Daimler dissolved its merger with Chrysler in 2007. As a result, Chrysler's sales in China are tiny -- only 13,686 Jeeps, 10,970 Dodges and 284 Chryslers in the first 10 months of this year, according to LMC Automotive, a British consulting firm. Bill Russo, a former Chrysler executive who oversaw the company's operations in China until 2008 and is now an industry consultant in Beijing, said in a telephone interview Wednesday evening that while some Chinese trade actions might benefit Chinese industries, it was unlikely that the latest move was done to help Chinese automakers. Imported S.U.V.'s and cars cost so much more than Chinese models that ""people are not shopping these on price,"" Mr. Russo said. ""No local company makes a product even close."" Imported models already cost much more in China compared with their home markets because of steep Chinese tariffs, value-added taxes and a system of sales taxes that range from 1 percent on fuel-sipping subcompacts to 40 percent on large sport utility vehicles and sports cars. The Chinese Commerce Ministry's announcement on Wednesday was the latest in a series of zigzags on trade policy this autumn, as Chinese officials have struggled over how confrontational a stance to take now that the Obama administration has begun to challenge Chinese trade policies more aggressively.

Just three days ago, President Hu Jintao gave a conciliatory speech to observe China's W.T.O. anniversary. Mr. Hu said that China would further open up its international trade. But last week, the Commerce Ministry strongly criticized a recent preliminary decision by the United States International Trade Commission, which concluded that imports of Chinese solar panels had hurt American solar panel manufacturers. That decision moves the United States one step closer to imposing antidumping and antisubsidy duties on Chinese solar panels early next year.","The new duties, which apply mainly to sport utility vehicles and large cars, signal an escalation in trade hostilities.",568c8258-9800-5bd7-95f6-9f6717b40daf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/12/15/business/Yuanjp/Yuanjp-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=370&w=600&s=e3acf317e81aa74597dda17f426c9d5939a85d88435d089d0bf4b96a16b7cd6d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"New duties will mainly affect General Motors and Chrysler, and BMW and Daimler of Germany.",568c8258-9800-5bd7-95f6-9f6717b40daf,N24News/imgs/568c8258-9800-5bd7-95f6-9f6717b40daf.jpg,24
Real Estate,Shopping for Multi-Armed Chandeliers,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/27/realestate/shopping-for-multi-armed-chandeliers.html,"Some chandeliers illuminate a cluster of crystals or dangle a collection of pendants, but there is another style that is becoming increasingly popular in contemporary interiors: the slender, multi-armed chandelier that stretches out and distributes light across a larger area.

""We typically use chandeliers like that in dining rooms, where you want to create a celebratory mood,"" said Richard Petit, a founder of The Archers, an interior design firm in Los Angeles.

Mr. Petit has installed a variety of multi-armed chandeliers in his clients' homes, from the classic three-headed fixture by Serge Mouille to the serpentine model by the Dutch designer Frederik Molenschot that sprouts dozens of lights. But whichever one he chooses, he said, ""it's the centerpiece and conversation piece.""

Of course, the dining room isn't the only place that will benefit from a multi-armed fixture. ""If they're delicate and elemental, they can be really beautiful in bedrooms,"" Mr. Petit said, or in stairwells, where multiple arms can be an eye-catching feature.",A multi-armed light fixture can add drama to a dining room — or anyplace in need of illumination and a conversation piece.,adcb3b88-c45f-50f4-8bf6-257650cf97d6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/27/realestate/02shopping1d/02shopping1d-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=3303d10cff3a446bb22497a73ff079ae7b3b30b542b68c51a9688dd4b2008ab7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"How do you design a room that has a statement chandelier?

Technology,"With Cryptocurrencies in Free Fall, One Big Firm Doubles Down",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/technology/andreessen-horowitz-cryptocurrencies-fund.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Even with the cryptocurrency markets in an extended slump, the most prominent venture capital firm in the sector is doubling down.

Andreessen Horowitz, the well-known firm that made early bets on Instagram and Reddit, said on Monday that it was creating a $300 million fund focused exclusively on projects inspired by the original virtual currency, Bitcoin. One of the leaders of the new fund will be the firm's first female general partner, Kathryn Haun, a former federal prosecutor.

Last year, when Bitcoin and most other virtual currencies were gaining in value, most of the large venture capital firms began beefing up on cryptocurrency expertise and making investments.

Andreessen Horowitz was ahead of many of its peers. It was one of the first venture capital firms to begin dabbling in cryptocurrencies in 2013, when digital tokens were a fringe business.","Andreessen Horowitz, one of the best-known venture capital firms, is creating a $300 million fund that will invest in projects inspired by Bitcoin.",18cfad46-502f-541d-a9b1-ee0fc8e15f4e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/26/business/26ANDREESSEN/merlin_140253774_6528a628-9c00-4715-aeff-10d5cb46a2fc-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=92b771c2d0bb59c9d5d68ecb7aadbfb033b29ba659498140b3422ba83f0ab262&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Chris Dixon, a general partner at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, will help lead a $300 million fund devoted to projects inspired by Bitcoin.",18cfad46-502f-541d-a9b1-ee0fc8e15f4e,N24News/imgs/18cfad46-502f-541d-a9b1-ee0fc8e15f4e.jpg,20
Media,Megyn Kelly Meets With Donald Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/14/business/media/megyn-kelly-meets-with-donald-trump.html,"It was a high-level summit meeting above Midtown Manhattan, the latest twist in a story of public acrimony and private courtship. Donald J. Trump, the leading Republican candidate for president, and Megyn Kelly, a Fox News anchor, spoke for roughly an hour on Wednesday, their first interaction in months. By day's end, the two had reached a tentative truce in a feud that has captivated the political class and crystallized questions about Mr. Trump's attitude toward women and the news media. The meeting was requested by Ms. Kelly, whose questioning of Mr. Trump's derogatory remarks about women in the first Republican debate in August prompted him to attack her as ""crazy"" and ""overrated."" And it signaled the possible end of a standoff strange even by the standards of a confounding election year: the Republican front-runner refusing to appear in prime time with one of Fox News's biggest stars. The detente comes at a critical time for both. Mr. Trump, whose pugilism has been a hallmark of his political rise, is moving to soften his image ahead of a potential general election campaign in the fall. Ms. Kelly has said that she will consider leaving Fox News after her contract ends next year, even as she faced the prospect of an election year without access to the top ratings draw on television, Mr. Trump.

Their sit-down was preceded by a series of conversations between Mr. Trump and Roger Ailes, the powerful chairman of Fox News, about the candidate's strained relationship with Ms. Kelly. ""We met for about an hour, just the two of us, and had a chance to clear the air,"" Ms. Kelly said on her program on Wednesday night. But while she described Mr. Trump as ""gracious,"" she said that the candidate had not yet committed to an interview with her, adding, ""I hope we will have news to announce on that soon."" There were other signs that the meeting, which took place in Mr. Trump's 26th-floor executive office at Trump Tower, was a step forward, if not a full embrace. Afterward, Mr. Trump ate lunch with Mr. Ailes at the Fox News offices on Avenue of the Americas. And in an interview with another Fox anchor, Sean Hannity, Mr. Trump described Ms. Kelly as ""very, very nice."" ""Maybe it was time, or maybe she felt it was time,"" Mr. Trump said of the meeting. ""I give her a lot of credit for, you know, doing what she did, because I don't know -- that took a certain amount. So let's see what happens, but it was very nice."" Mending ties with Mr. Trump allows Ms. Kelly the chance to prove that she can land a major interview subject -- a ""get"" in television parlance -- even amid tough circumstances. For Mr. Trump, the reconciliation could help improve his relationship with female voters, a majority of whom say in opinion polls that they hold negative views of him.

Still, the meeting amounted to a striking turnaround for candidate and anchor alike. Ms. Kelly, in a recent interview, acknowledged that Mr. Trump's attacks on her had ""gotten very ugly"" and started to affect her personal life. ""I don't like putting my kids to bed and having to think about that vitriol,"" she told Katie Couric in a public interview in Manhattan last week.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions.
* $15 minimum wage for federal contractors will take effect Jan. 30. Ms. Kelly has also been candid about the difficulties that the feud has created for Fox News, one of the nation's most influential news sources among conservative voters. ""Fox is placed in a very difficult position because they have one of their lead news anchors under attack, and yet what are they going to do?"" she told Ms. Couric. ""They can't ban the presidential front-runner on the Republican side from coming on the channel."" Fox News has defended Ms. Kelly, at one point accusing Mr. Trump of harboring an ""extreme, sick obsession"" with her. But the network will face a different environment in the general election, when many viewers may expect the channel's personalities to show allegiance to the Republican nominee. Mr. Trump is looking ahead, too. After establishing a bullying, showmanlike approach to campaigning, Mr. Trump is in the midst of overhauling his team's message and approach as he prepares for a potential general election before a more moderate and diverse electorate. Mr. Trump recently hired a seasoned political hand, Paul J. Manafort, whose portfolio has grown beyond his original assignment as a delegate wrangler at this summer's Republican national convention. Now, Mr. Manafort is taking a bigger role in Mr. Trump's messaging and news media strategy. This week, Mr. Trump has sought to soften his image -- or, in his words, ""I will be so presidential you won't believe it."" The shift, Mr. Trump said Tuesday night, has been urged by his family members, who were sitting next to him as he made the remarks during a live town hall-style event on CNN. With his wife, Melania, at his side, Mr. Trump radiated a paternal beam as his four grown children attested to his skills as a father and mentor. For home viewers, the message was underscored, intentionally or not, by a prominent Twitter hashtag placed by CNN at the bottom of the screen: #TrumpFamily.

For Ms. Kelly, Mr. Trump's CNN event may have resonated in other ways. It edged ""The Kelly File"" in Tuesday night's prominent 9 p.m. time slot, according to Nielsen data, drawing 162,000 more viewers. Despite the complications, Ms. Kelly's feud with Mr. Trump has proved a boon for her career. She is among the most coveted stars on cable news during an extraordinary election year, just as she nears the end of her contract. In a first for a leading Fox News personality, she has been praised by the leading Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, who called her a ""superb journalist,"" and embraced by the very news media elites, including Ms. Couric, whom Fox News made its name skewering. Ms. Kelly has attributed her success, in part, to her role as a rare symbol of Trump resistance in television news. ""I'm the second-highest-rated show in all of cable news, and I haven't had Trump on in seven months,"" she said on her show several weeks ago. ""It can be done without him, too.""",The feud between the Fox News anchor and the leading Republican candidate for president has been a strange subplot in a confounding election year.,88b0eb76-de7c-51b8-8798-fdfab86f7297,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/14/business/14kelly/14kelly-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=5f9152866c552563d2f3ea556251dc9dd02c23a76cf2c8aabfa367622dce59c3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Megyn Kelly, the Fox News anchor, at an event at Lincoln Center last week.",88b0eb76-de7c-51b8-8798-fdfab86f7297,N24News/imgs/88b0eb76-de7c-51b8-8798-fdfab86f7297.jpg,16
Travel,"In California, Finding 'Fat City' With the Man Who Wrote It",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/travel/leonard-gardner-stockton-california-finding-fat-city-novel.html,"Photographs of boxers make up a wall of fame at the Fat City Boxing Club in Stockton.Credit...Jason Henry for The New York Times



Most people will have you believe that a city starts at its outskirts. You get there by landing at an airport or exiting a freeway ramp, following directional signs in plain highway green and white. A city's boundaries are clearly drawn; cross a line, and you're there. You'll probably have to fight your way through a ring of big box architecture and layers of residential sprawl, but eventually you'll find the heart of it: an old downtown full of ornate, once-magnificent buildings. But I came to Stockton, Calif., a different way. For me, it will always be a place that I first entered through the pages of a book. ""He lived in the Hotel Coma,"" states the first line of ""Fat City,"" Leonard Gardner's 1969 novel. A dissipated boxer named Billy Tully surveys the view: ""From his window he looked out on the stunted skyline of Stockton -- a city of eighty thousand surrounded by the sloughs, rivers and fertile fields of the San Joaquin River delta -- a view of business buildings, church spires, chimneys, water towers, gas tanks and the low roofs of residences rising among leafless trees between absolutely flat streets."" The real Stockton is near the center of California's Central Valley, about 90 minutes east of San Francisco; its population in recent decades has ballooned to over 300,000. These days it's infamous for being the second-largest American city after Detroit to go bankrupt following the economic meltdown of 2007. The city filed for Chapter 9 municipal protection in 2012 with over $700 million in debt, and emerged in 2015 after cost-cutting and reorganization. The indie-rock band Pavement came from here, as did the alt-country crooner Chris Isaak. It's home to the University of the Pacific, whose music department produced the jazz musician Dave Brubeck. A revamped section downtown has a gleaming sports arena (completed in 2005) and a mall. The real Stockton is nice enough. But the Stockton of ""Fat City"" is lurid and legendary. It's where guys with flasks in their pockets line up on street corners at 4 a.m. to ride rattletrap buses into agricultural fields to pick tomatoes or top onions. Downtown is rife with greasy diners, fleabag hotels and steamy dive bars. Drunks take cover from the rain in incinerator silos. Boxers bust each other's noses in basement gyms. Dissolute men pine for wives who have ditched them, and dissolute women carp at no-good boyfriends. It's not pretty, yet somehow, through the honesty of its grime and the earnest way its inhabitants try to scrape and spar their way out of it, it becomes beautiful. ""Fat City"" is an Edward Hopper painting, a Robert Frank photograph, a midnight-choir Tom Waits operetta plunked on an out-of-tune piano.

Mr. Gardner has an old-fashioned grandeur. He wears a corduroy jacket; V-neck sweater; cuffed, rumpled trousers; and dress shoes. His light brown hair has a sheen of silver. When he adds a fedora to the ensemble, he's positively Sinatra-esque. His spoken syntax is flawless. It's rare that he starts a sentence with one idea and abandons it midway through for another. He's unerringly polite but not falsely modest. When I ask him about the N.Y.R.B. edition and how it feels to talk about a book he wrote almost 50 years ago, he says, ""It's a little like magical thinking came true, to have it still respected the way it is."" He warns me that most of the Stockton that inspired ""Fat City"" is long gone. ""Everybody in town called it Skid Row,"" he says. ""There would be editorials in the newspaper: 'We've got to clean up Skid Row.'"" When Huston and his crew arrived to shoot the film, a tear-down was in effect. ""One hotel that we used in the opening of the movie was torn down the day after it was shot,"" Mr. Gardner says. ""The film company must have made a deal, like, 'Don't knock it down until we shoot there.'""

Leonard Gardner was born and raised in Stockton. His father, originally from Texas, was a postal inspector with an office in a stately, muraled federal building downtown. His mother, an Englishwoman, was a homemaker who was proper, religious and artistic. When Mr. Gardner was 7 or 8, he and his older sister caught rheumatic fever, and he missed two years of school. To help him recover, his father, a boxing enthusiast and former amateur, bought him a pair of gloves and hung a speed bag in the garage. ""I got so that every day I'd be out there, 10 rounds on the bag,"" Mr. Gardner says. ""He wanted me to build myself up. And it did make me strong and healthy."" The father's passion became the son's. ""He talked a lot about boxing,"" Mr. Gardner says. ""I'd spar with him when I was 12 or 14 and he was in his 50s. He was slick and clever and hard to hit."" Soon the young man could outbox his neighborhood buddies. ""I made myself go to the Lido Gym, which was full of professionals and amateurs,"" Mr. Gardner says. ""Rough, tough guys. Some of them could really rattle your brain."" He only lasted at the Lido for a couple of months. ""I got my nose broken in my first bout,"" he says. ""The doctor told me, 'Don't put gloves on for a couple of months.' It didn't mean anything to my manager. He was phoning me: 'Forget about that, come on down, work out.' But I didn't."" By that time he had developed another interest, writing. He got a job as an attendant in a Skid Row gas station. ""Almost everyone I knew in Stockton would never set foot in Skid Row,"" he says. ""But I think I was just inclined to be a writer. I got acquainted with the local winos, and some of them were nice guys. I wrote a piece for my high school English class, 'The Life of a Wino.' The teacher read it in class, and people told me it was better than the essays or stories in our textbook."" He left Stockton at 19, lived for a time in Mexico City and wound up in San Francisco. The passion for boxing stayed with him. ""I wanted to write a novel about a guy struggling in Skid Row with a poverty-stricken life,"" he says. ""And I also knew I wanted to write about boxers. And somewhere along the line I got the idea to put the two together."" Stockton stayed with him, too. ""It never occurred to me to write a boxing novel set anywhere else,"" he says.

""After a steak dinner with Ruben and a stroll along El Dorado Street, Billy Tully went back to the Oxford Hotel, where he had been sleeping, sober and alone, for the past week."" Mr. Gardner wrote ""Fat City"" over four years in San Francisco, but occasionally took a bus back to Stockton for research. ""I was living on peanuts,"" he says. ""Sometimes I came down and stayed in a crummy cheap hotel. That sign on a wall in the book, 'If you smoke in bed, let us know where to send your ashes,' that was on the wall in a room I rented in this hotel."" Back in the car, Mr. Gardner threads his way toward the old business district. We pass aged barrooms with out-of-work neon beer steins and the original branch of the Bank of Stockton, a seven-story Beaux-Arts building, once Stockton's tallest. He stops in front of Xochimilco, a Mexican cafe. Dusk is falling. In the novel, a climactic bout takes place between Billy Tully, an aging contender making another stab at the big time, and a Mexican fighter named Lucero. Overweight and also over the hill, Lucero arrives in Stockton by bus, checks into a hotel and proceeds to a Mexican restaurant downtown called El Tecolote.

The next day Mr. Gardner takes me to the Fat City Boxing Club, run by his old friend Yaqui Lopez, a former light-heavyweight title contender and member of the World Boxing Hall of Fame. They met around the time of the Huston film -- Mr. Lopez played Jeff Bridges's sparring partner -- and stayed friends. The gym, inside a former car dealership, is deafening. The sound of pounding speed bags mixes with Mexican music blaring over a sound system. Two young boxers in face guards and body padding spar in an elevated ring. Mr. Lopez, 65, tall and incredibly fit, has fists the size of my head. The walls are covered with framed posters from his bouts in places like Atlantic City, Copenhagen and Rome. Mr. Lopez started the gym a few years ago to give underprivileged Stockton youth a place to channel their energy. We watch the two fighters in the ring. ""They're punching each other around pretty well,"" Mr. Gardner says. ""I can hear the punches,"" I say. ""It's all part of training,"" he says. ""The idea is, you get used to punches coming at you, and if they hit you, you don't flinch. You're not even supposed to blink, because you might get hit with another one that you wouldn't see coming. You're supposed to take a punch with your eyes open. And maybe look for your opening to counter with a punch of your own. If you didn't box very much, you might be punch-shy and flinch.""

Behind the banners we can see the old scoreboard and balcony seats. Mr. Gardner swivels his neck. ""They'd have the ring right here in the center,"" he says. ""And a whole lot of, I guess, folding chairs. ""I went to a lot of fights here in the old days,"" Mr. Gardner says. ""I saw Yaqui Lopez fight here."" He continues to search in the recesses of the ceiling beyond the drapes. ""I'm looking for the tassel,"" he says. ""When Billy Tully gets knocked down, he's looking at a big tassel hanging down from the center of the building."" ""He looked up at the lights and the brown and blue gathered drapery way up at the apex of the ceiling where a giant gold tassel hung, the whole scene shattered by a zigzag diagonal line, like a crack in a window. He did not remember rising, or how he got through the round."" All we could see was a thick, bare cable. ""They got rid of the tassel,"" Mr. Gardner says. After the ""Fat City"" film came out, Mr. Gardner adapted one of his short stories, ""Christ Has Returned to Earth and Preaches Here Nightly,"" into a screenplay called ""Valentino Returns."" The film was briefly released in 1989. He wrote and worked as a producer for the TV show ""NYPD Blue."" ""Sweeter Than Sugar,"" a piece of boxing journalism about the first matchup between Roberto Duran and Sugar Ray Leonard in 1980, is in the 2011 Modern Library anthology ""At the Fights: American Writers on Boxing.""

And even later, he grouses about people always asking him why he never wrote another novel. But revisiting Stockton seemed to be having a subterranean effect. ""I do have a dream,"" he says. ""I don't want to go on at length talking about my next novel because it's a long way off and who knows if I'll ever do it. But a lot of it would be set here. So I need to stay in touch with the old town."" We decide to take another crack at the Lido Gym. Those Moorish columns along the front are intact, if weathered and chipped. Up a flight of steps we stop at a front desk behind thick plexiglass. A group of men, sitting around talking, stop and stare. After intense negotiations and promises not to sue, a manager agrees to take us to the basement. ""In a ring under a ceiling of exposed joists, wiring, water and sewage pipes, a Negro was shadowboxing in the light of fluorescent tubes. Three men in street clothes, one bald, one with deeply furrowed cheeks, the third wearing a houndstooth-check hat with a narrow upturned brim, all turned their faces toward the door."" The ceiling is low, a maze of beams, pipes and wires. The concrete floor is stained with water. The walls are bare, except for some graffiti. A carbon monoxide detector beeps. Just as we had been forewarned, there's nothing here. Nothing whatsoever. We walk around and our footsteps echo, tracking the water across dry spots. ""The ring was in the center,"" Mr. Gardner says. ""The speed bags were against the wall. I think the shower room was there under the sidewalk. To get to the lockers, you went through the shower room, and the drain was always faulty and so you were sort of wading through an inch or two of water, walking on our heels with the front part of our shoes out of the water."" His voice is subdued, maybe a little pained. ""I would have thought there would at least be an old punching bag in the corner, or something,"" he says. As barren and empty as the room is, I can see it all. The men, the lights, the damp and the thump of glove on skin. Or is it just the powerful imprint of the novel? As I stand here, it occurs to me that this is the essence of fiction: the liminal space between the tangible world outside and the inner layout of the mind, the antechambers of reality that usher us into the imagination. This is ""Fat City."" I've made it. I turn to say something to Mr. Gardner, but he is preoccupied. He stands with his head bent, leaning slightly on one foot and his fedora cocked forward on his head. He is holding a pocket notebook that I didn't even know he was carrying, and he is writing.","Stockton inspired Leonard Gardner's acclaimed 1969 novel.

Music,"Harold Budd, Composer of Spaciousness and Calm, Dies at 84",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/17/arts/music/harold-budd-dead-coronavirus.html,"Harold Budd, a composer and pianist known for the preternatural spaciousness and melancholy calm of his music, and for his collaborations with art-pop artists like Brian Eno and Cocteau Twins, died on Dec. 8 in a hospital in Arcadia, Calif. He was 84. The cause was complications of Covid-19, which he contracted at a short-term rehabilitation facility while undergoing therapy after having a stroke on Nov. 11, his manager, Steve Takaki, said.

That sound, which Mr. Budd began developing in 1972, found its first fruition on ""The Pavilion of Dreams,"" a 1978 album produced and released by Mr. Eno. In 1980, Mr. Budd and Mr. Eno jointly created ""Ambient 2: The Plateaux of Mirror,"" a watershed work for both artists, not least for its feeling of unhurried, organic spontaneity. For their next collaboration, ""The Pearl,"" released in 1984, they brought in a second credited producer, Daniel Lanois. ""I just want to say one thing again clearly right now: I owe Eno everything,"" Mr. Budd proclaimed in a 2016 interview with L.A. Record, a music publication. Recording with Mr. Eno in London had ""opened up another world for me that I didn't know existed,"" he said, ""and suddenly I was a part of it."" Mr. Budd would go on to work with other artists active in popular music, including Andy Partridge of XTC and John Foxx, a founder of Ultravox. A collaboration with the Scottish trio Cocteau Twins -- whose music shared with Mr. Budd's a quality of esoteric reverie -- produced the 1986 album ""The Moon and the Melodies."" An enduring bond with Robin Guthrie, the Cocteau Twins guitarist and songwriter, resulted in several film scores and duo albums. The latest, ""Another Flower,"" was recorded in 2013 but released this month.

Harold Montgomery Budd was born on May 24, 1936, to Harold Budd, who worked in the textile industry, and Dorothy (McNeill) Budd, a homemaker. His father died when he was 13, resulting in financial hardship that prompted the family to move to Victorville, on the edge of the Mojave Desert. An early interest in jazz led Mr. Budd to take up the drums. He played nightclub dates in Los Angeles while working days at Northrop Corporation, the aircraft manufacturer, to support his family; he later attended Los Angeles City College. Drafted into the Army, he performed in a band with the saxophonist Albert Ayler, who would achieve renown as a free-jazz firebrand. On his return to civilian life, Mr. Budd enrolled at San Fernando Valley State College (now California State University, Northridge), where he studied with Gerald Strang, a protege of the formidable modernist Arnold Schoenberg, earning his bachelor's degree in 1962. Awarded a scholarship to study composition with Ingolf Dahl at the University of Southern California, Mr. Budd discovered a foundational inspiration in the painter Mark Rothko, whose canvases he described as ""brilliant blasts of color that simply engulfed you."" It led to his orchestral homage titled ""Rothko,"" which he presented as part of his thesis in earning a master's degree in composition in 1966 (even though his thesis jurors said the piece was too rhythmically difficult to perform).

John Cage also exerted an influence, though less for his music than for his ideas and his courage in forging a career outside of the academy. Works like ""Magnus Colorado"" (1969) and the 24-hour ""Lirio"" (1971) involved reverberant gongs and controlled lighting, fusing Mr. Budd's compositional ideas with his interests in visual art and installation. For ""The Oak of the Golden Dream"" (1970), Mr. Budd used the Buchla Box, an early synthesizer, to pair an unwavering bass drone with an incantatory treble melody, in a manner reminiscent of Terry Riley's early works. Gripped by a growing sense of sterility in the classical avant-garde while teaching composition at the California Institute of the Arts from 1970 to 1976, Mr. Budd retreated from public work; privately, he explored the unambiguous melodic simplicity he found in medieval and Renaissance music. His composition ""Madrigals of the Rose Angel"" (1972) marked the birth of his mature style. A recording of the piece reached Mr. Eno, whose own thinking about music, listening and atmosphere was coalescing into what he would term ""ambient"" music -- one of many labels, including ""New Age,"" that Mr. Budd resisted. ""I just have utterly no interest in that sort of thing,"" he said of such categorizing in a 2014 interview with The Guardian. Despite the break with past work, some essence of Mr. Budd's early influences remained. His album ""The Pavilion of Dreams"" featured the alto saxophonist Marion Brown, a colleague of John Coltrane's. It included the hymn ""Let Us Go Into the House of the Lord,"" with an arrangement inspired by that of the Coltrane acolyte Pharoah Sanders, and ""Butterfly Sunday,"" a reworking of Coltrane's ""After the Rain."" Other collaborators on the album included the English experimental composers Michael Nyman and Gavin Bryars. From that point, and especially after ""Ambient 2: The Plateaux of Mirrors,"" Mr. Budd charted a course that rarely wavered, yet accommodated abundant variety and discovery. He performed alone and with groups, recorded with poets and wrote poetry of his own, and made two albums of improvisations with the video artist Jane Maru. Mr. Budd is survived by two sons, Matthew and Terrence, from his first marriage, to Paula Katzman; and by another son, Hugo, from his marriage to Ellen Wirth, who died in 2012. Mr. Budd's brother and stepsister died before him.

Technology,Advertiser Exodus Snowballs as Facebook Struggles to Ease Concerns,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/technology/facebook-advertising-boycott.html,"According to five people with knowledge of the discussion, Mr. Zuckerberg's message to advertisers was clear: We won't back down. But over the past week, Facebook's attitude has changed. Marketing giants like Unilever, Coca-Cola and Pfizer announced that they were pausing their Facebook advertising. That outcry has grown, hitting the company's wallet.

To contain the damage, Facebook began holding daily calls and sending emails to advertisers to soothe them, advertising executives said. Nick Clegg, the company's communications chief, made a series of media appearances stressing that Facebook was doing its best to tamp down hate speech. On Monday, Facebook also agreed to an audit by the Media Rating Council over its approach to hate speech. The company's executives continued the campaign on Tuesday morning with another video meeting with advertisers, followed by separate sessions with ad holding companies. At the meeting, Facebook's marketing chief, Carolyn Everson, public policy director, Neil Potts, and vice president for integrity, Guy Rosen, took a more conciliatory tone, acknowledging clients' concerns about ads appearing next to hate speech and misinformation, said four people with knowledge of the event. Yet even as Facebook has labored to stanch the ad exodus, it is having little effect. Executives at ad agencies said that more of their clients were weighing whether to join the boycott, which now numbers more than 300 advertisers and is expected to grow. Pressure on top advertisers is coming from politicians, supermodels, actors and even Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, they said. Internally, some Facebook employees said they were also using the boycott to push for change. ""Other companies are seeing this moment, and are stepping up proactively,"" said Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, citing recent efforts from Reddit, YouTube and Twitch taking down posts and content that promote hate speech across their sites. ""If they can do it, and all of Facebook's advertisers are asking them to do it, it doesn't seem that hard to do."" The push from advertisers has led Facebook's business to a precarious point. While the social network has struggled with issues such as election interference and privacy in recent years, its juggernaut digital ads business has always powered forward. The Silicon Valley company has never faced a public backlash of this magnitude from its advertisers, whose spending accounts for more than 98 percent of its annual $70.7 billion in revenue.

""Their intentions are good, but their judgment is poor,"" David Jones, a top advertising executive, said of Facebook. Mr. Jones, who was a founding member of Facebook's client council, a group of ad executives who advise the company, said if the social network did not make further progress on hate speech, then ""they're starting down a long slippery slope to being irrelevant."" Facebook said in a statement that it had invested billions of dollars in technology and employees to sort through content, and that it had agreed to a civil rights audit. It also said it had banned 250 white supremacist organizations from its core Facebook site and its photo-sharing site, Instagram. The company said it had made investments in artificial intelligence that resulted in the removal of nearly 90 percent of hate speech before users report it, and recent surveys put Facebook ahead of competitors like Twitter and YouTube in assessing reports of hate speech. ""We know we have more work to do,"" a company spokeswoman said. ""Our principles have not changed, but our leaders are rightly spending time with clients and others to discuss the progress we've made on the key issues of concern."" The ad boycott may ultimately deliver more of a hit to Facebook's reputation than to its bottom line. The top 100 advertisers on Facebook spent $4.2 billion on ads last year, or roughly 6 percent of the company's total ad revenue, according to data cited in an investor note from Stifel. More than 70 percent of Facebook's ad revenue comes from small businesses. Yet the big-name brands that have pulled back are recognizable and may create a trickle-down effect, analysts said. Current boycott participants spent well over half a billion dollars advertising on Facebook last year, according to estimates from Pathmatics, an advertising analytics platform. Some of that money might go to other sites like TikTok, Snapchat, Pinterest and Amazon, or to publishers with stronger content controls, ad executives said. ""There's a greater sensitivity to where brands are investing and what those platforms stand for than ever before,"" said Harry Kargman, the chief executive of the mobile advertising company Kargo Global. ""They're effectively voting with their pocketbooks."" Advertisers began taking action against Facebook's handling of hate speech about two weeks ago while facing pressure from the Anti-Defamation League, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Color of Change and other civil rights groups. On June 19, the North Face and REI were among the first brands to join a boycott.

High-profile allies quickly joined in. Roughly 10 days ago, representatives for Prince Harry and Meghan reached out to the head of the Anti-Defamation League to ask how they could support the movement, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. The couple called C.E.O.s at some of Facebook's biggest ad buyers and implored them to stop their ad purchases, they said. Axios previously reported the couple's involvement. Representatives for the couple declined to comment. Skeptics of the boycott have suggested that the companies participating are using the effort to deflect attention from how their advertising budgets have been decimated by the coronavirus pandemic. And the companies that have backed away are not doing so uniformly. Companies like Best Buy and REI are planning to pause their paid advertising on Facebook only in July. Others, such as Verizon and HP, have said they will resume advertising on the site once Facebook offers better solutions for managing hate speech. Still others, like Diageo and Starbucks, are holding back their spending from all social media platforms. Yet the prospect of a boycott caused Facebook to bring out Mr. Zuckerberg last Tuesday to the virtual meeting with advertisers. There, Mr. Zuckerberg struck a defiant tone. He discussed the importance of freedom of speech and stressed his company would not bow to pressure on its revenue, said the people with knowledge of the meeting. In some recent calls with marketing executives, Facebook officials have tried to reframe the issue of hate speech as an ""industrywide"" problem, pointing to Twitter and YouTube too, said three marketers who have had talks with Facebook. The message, these people said, was simple: ""Don't boycott us unless you're willing to boycott everyone."" Last week after talks with Facebook, Unilever said it would pause ad buying across all social media, including Twitter. The company, which is one of the largest advertisers in the world, said in a statement that ""continuing to advertise on these platforms at this time would not add value to people and society.""","The social network has tried striking a more conciliatory tone with its advertisers, who object to its handling of hate speech.",20c6f11d-552b-51bb-aebb-9adeb14117dc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/30/business/30facebook/30facebook-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=8690360dfae98e255095ac7648d5bf98460e8bed2142367c923802a610cdc2ea&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief.

Fashion & Style,"'If You're Thinking About Your Underwear, You're Wearing the Wrong Underwear'",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/fashion/underwear-commando-new-york-fashion-week.html,"During fashion week, hair and makeup help make the outfit, but don't overlook the underwear. Without the right underpinnings, even the best dress can go so wrong. Little wonder that just as there are go-to beauty experts (Pat McGrath and Orlando Pita, for example), there is a go-to brand for lingerie. Commando, which not coincidentally also dominates the red carpet, is working with more than 30 brands during New York Fashion Week, including Rodarte, Rag & Bone and Zac Posen. ""At first, I was very nervous,"" said Kerry O'Brien, the founder and designer of Commando. ""I was terrified there was going to be a panty line."" Now a veteran of more than five years of fashion weeks and a member of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, Ms. O'Brien took some time after the Rodarte spring 2017 show to discuss what matters when it comes to what lies beneath, and why. On the catwalk or off.

Designers most often ask for the classic microfiber thong, the brand's best seller. Nude, followed by black and white, is the most requested shade, though Ms. O'Brien thinks the word ""nude"" is a misnomer. ""You could have 50 shades of nude and it wouldn't match everyone's skin tone,"" she said. ""So we try to have a spectrum of nudes that fits as many skin tones as possible.""

Also, as many dresses. The designers of Rodarte, Laura and Kate Mulleavy, regularly give Commando their planned palette, the better to produce knickers that will blend in with the clothes. ""They want a monochromatic look, in my opinion,"" Ms. O'Brien said. ""They always like to have matching color underwear."" Ms. O'Brien strives to avoid seams in underwear designs. Even an eighth of an inch, which is the standard seam allowance for ready-to-wear, changes how an undergarment fits. ""I don't want a seam in my garment unless it improves the garment,"" she said. To wit: For its spring 2017 collection, Houghton worked with Commando on a selection of bodysuits. ""The problem with bodysuits is they show panty lines,"" Ms. O'Brien said. ""So they created these gorgeous, ready-to-wear tops and then they sewed our bottoms onto them."" Still, she noted that while in the past, designers mostly wanted thongs that would be invisible, many are now asking for the opposite. For spring 2016, Tracy Reese sent out a collection featuring a number of sheer frocks, so Commando produced a special selection of colors for the outfits. ""We don't normally have yellow and pink hosiery,"" Ms. O'Brien said. ""There are no limitations except the fabrics have to be luxurious and technical,"" said Ms. O'Brien, who favors a signature microfiber that doesn't fray or run. One way to assess a fabric's quality, she said, is to look at its give and take: It should stretch to accommodate the body's form yet not bounce back to its original shape. But it shouldn't bag either.

For a model, ""If you're thinking about your underwear, you're wearing the wrong underwear,"" Ms. O'Brien said. To ensure that everything fits and feels the way she expects, Ms. O'Brien tests the products on different types of bodies -- as well as on herself. ""At fittings, I will put on the underwear,"" Ms. O'Brien said. ""I'm always wearing a dress, and I'm 5-foot-10 and I walk fast. I walk all the way across the mezzanine. And I come back, and if I'm like, 'It didn't pass the test,' it won't go into production.""","Kerry O'Brien, the founder of Commando, which is working with dozens of brands during New York Fashion Week, breaks down what lies beneath.",78ae43f0-26a9-51f2-bff1-044a4421e7da,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/13/fashion/13COMMANDO01/13COMMANDO01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=33bd7985664fc7e5b93774287d645b9f07b0ee15f0561397a400c72f88c10d15&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Backstage at Rodarte's spring 2017 show, where looks were shown with Commando undergarments underneath.",78ae43f0-26a9-51f2-bff1-044a4421e7da,N24News/imgs/78ae43f0-26a9-51f2-bff1-044a4421e7da.jpg,19
Science,Mega-Tsunamis Wiped Away Shoreline of a Martian Ocean,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/20/science/mars-ancient-ocean-tsunamis.html,"Tsunamis waves tall enough to swallow the Statue of Liberty washed away the shorelines of Mars's ancient ocean, according to a study published Thursday.

In the wake of their destructive force, a Martian mystery was born.

Planetary scientists had hypothesized for decades that a primordial ocean might have once covered much of the red planet's northern hemisphere. Last year they presented molecular traces of atmospheric water that backed the claim. But still missing from their theory were visible traces of the ocean's coastline.

They essentially had evidence of an ancient ocean, but could not find its shore.

""We're showing that the shorelines were there, but they were overrun and buried by the tsunami waves,"" said J. Alexis Rodriguez, a Mars geologist at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz., and an author of the paper.

Using images from spacecrafts orbiting Mars, Dr. Rodriguez and his colleagues identified what they say are geological remnants like boulders and ice debris left from the tsunamis. They published their results in the journal Scientific Reports.",Planetary scientists report finding the shoreline of an ocean that might have once covered much of Mars's northern hemisphere.,1c80d10a-d6f1-5f6c-95a7-c9345fa7a98a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/06/science/TB20-tsunami5/TB20-tsunami5-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=2ee7517ab5e6cbfb64ec0d2911df4967eae856dd5185bea18483ba0abad41065&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An artist&rsquo;s impression of what Mars&rsquo;s ancient ocean looked like.,1c80d10a-d6f1-5f6c-95a7-c9345fa7a98a,N24News/imgs/1c80d10a-d6f1-5f6c-95a7-c9345fa7a98a.jpg,2

Fashion & Style,The Second Biggest Fashion Show in Cannes,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/fashion/philipp-plein-cruise-collection-cannes.html,"CANNES, France -- Forget Nicole Kidman in an Alexander McQueen sheer peach lace halter dress; forget Elle Fanning in a Rodarte lavender tulle ball gown and Tilda Swinton in a sparkling black Chanel jumpsuit. It is possible that the most jaw-dropping fashion spectacle in Cannes this week took place not on the film festival's red carpet, but high in the hills above the Riviera, where the German goth rock designer Philipp Plein showed his 2018 men's and women's cruise collections, the better to take advantage of the critical mass of celebrities and models that had descended on the Cote d'Azur.

Which included Paris Hilton in a black silk negligee gown with plunging lace decollete and black suede thigh-high lace-up stiletto boots. Along with the boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. in a white crocodile motorcycle jacket speckled with colorful winged dollar bills, and black motorcycle pants. And the American felon turned model Jeremy Meeks, a.k.a. the Blue Eyed Bandit, shirtless, wearing a black jean jacket and matching pants, his Philipp Plein-emblazoned underwear rising high above the waistband. ""We had to fight with the embassy to get him here,"" Mr. Plein said before the show, lounging in his silver and white living room, wearing a Philipp Plein white T-shirt with a neon green dollar sign as the logo, drooping faded Philipp Plein jeans and white Philipp Plein sneakers tagged by the graffiti artist Alec Monopoly. Mr. Plein was speaking almost entirely in exclamation points, his preferred mode.

Still, his own style was relatively tame compared with what appeared on his raspberry-red runway: faded denim bikinis with patch pockets on the derriere; gold sequined pajama pants; crystal-embedded booty shorts; snakeskin stiletto boots; and his signature vintage German army jackets embroidered with Swarovski crystal roses and skulls. The show concluded with the model Winnie Harlow in a long white jean skirt and oversize white T-shirt strolling barefoot to ""Welcome to the Jungle"" by Guns N' Roses, as Mr. Monopoly, wearing a Lone Ranger mask, spray-painted her clothes with Day-Glo tags. The crowd erupted in cheers, and several crystal champagne flutes shattered on the limestone terrace.

Even with Mr. Monopoly's performance, compared with past Plein shows that have included roller coasters and monster trucks, the event was almost subdued -- in part because it was held in Mr. Plein's home as opposed to, say, the New York Public Library, where his fall 2017 show took place.

As it turned out, Mr. Plein had originally wanted to go back to New York (where he has another house; he has four) with this show, and stage it before the Met Gala in early May, but the clothes were not going to be ready in time. So he decided on Cannes, the next best glitterati thing, and his own home as inspiration. He is not the first designer to see the synergies in the sud. Over the years, fashion has piggybacked on the film festival's draw of the shiny and photogenic numerous times, be it for store openings, Victoria's Secret fashion shows or Naomi Campbell's annual Fashion for Relief fund-raiser, held last Sunday in a hangar at the nearby private jet airport. In that tradition, Mr. Plein transported his team of 20 designers from his three brands -- Philipp Plein, Philipp Plein Sport and Billionaire -- to his house (they had to share the bedrooms), and they cooked up the collection. The show also publicly kicked off the company's coming retail expansion. It has 100 stores worldwide, and Roberto Magnani, the new head of global sales -- recruited from Tod's Group -- said that by year's end that figure would double. Mr. Plein said: ""The company should be up to $300 million in turnover, with no debt and no investors; not one cent owned to one bank in the world. It's a self-driving business.""","Philipp Plein brings his cruise show to his home on the Riviera, complete with Paris Hilton and crystal-embedded booty shorts.",f1ee7c3f-9b5a-5121-8812-f313aeee799b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/25/fashion/25PLEIN-web1/25PLEIN-web1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=77ce652d38c80a7857c53ec28b69d0269baf2159f67dd3b5559d14d4e7b6b860&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Paris Hilton and her boyfriend, Chris Zylka, walking the runway at the Philipp Plein cruise collection show, which was held during the Cannes Film Festival.",f1ee7c3f-9b5a-5121-8812-f313aeee799b,N24News/imgs/f1ee7c3f-9b5a-5121-8812-f313aeee799b.jpg,19
Automobiles,"In Sign of Strength, Audi Steps Up Investments",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/automobiles/in-sign-of-strength-audi-steps-up-investments.html,"FRANKFURT -- Audi, the luxury car unit of Volkswagen, said on Friday that it would spend more than it ever has on expansion and new models over the next four years, a demonstration of how Germany's high-end carmakers have retained their financial strength during a crisis that has devastated their European rivals.

Audi said it would invest 22 billion euros, or more than $30 billion, through 2018, a record for the company. Most of the money will be used to design new models and develop new technology like more fuel-efficient engines. The company will also expand its international production network as it strives to sell two million models annually by 2015, up from more than 1.5 million this year.

Audi and its German rivals BMW and Mercedes-Benz, a unit of Daimler, have suffered far less from the economic malaise in Europe that has pushed car sales to a 20-year low. As a result they have been able to continue expanding, in contrast to companies like Fiat of Italy, which has all but stopped introducing new cars under the Fiat brand.

While mass-market carmakers including Ford and General Motors' Opel unit have lost billions of dollars in Europe and have had to close factories, luxury German carmakers have been operating at close to full capacity as they serve demand in the United States and China. Even in Europe, German carmakers have had less drastic sales declines than mass-market car brands, in part because the economy in their home market has remained strong.","Audi, which like its German rivals has suffered less from the economic malaise in Europe than other carmakers, said it would spend more than $30 billion through 2018.",e6275af0-d8e1-59e3-aa29-0846e4a54619,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/28/business/28audi-span/28audi-span-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=338&w=600&s=8a6abd5b1c19c63a5164c7edef4dd90a3962fa0d36fd316ea39228b05451d982&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"The 2014 Audi Q5 S.U.V.

Fashion & Style,Telling Italy's Story Through Its Clothes,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/fashion/italiana-italy-exhibit-milan-fashion-week.html,"Among the designers whose work forms the backbone of ""Italiana: Italy Through the Lens of Fashion,"" which opens Feb. 22 at the Palazzo Reale during Milan Fashion Week, are names that hulk like monuments in the history of 20th-century fashion: Prada, Valentino, Armani, Versace. Yet there are also other seminal ones -- Walter Albini and Romeo Gigli come to mind -- that nowadays are sadly unfamiliar to all but dedicated cognoscenti. The curators, Stefano Tonchi (he is also the editor of W magazine) and Maria Luisa Frisa, an Italian fashion scholar, had ambitious goals in mind when they set out to examine Italy and Italianness through the lens of fashion. Determined to consider what, if anything, the vaunted ""Made in Italy"" label inside a garment really meant, they also performed an almost accidental act of resuscitation, bringing to light many worthy but lesser-known figures from the Italian fashion canon. Speaking by telephone from Milan one recent afternoon, Mr. Tonchi and Ms. Frisa discussed those overlooked designers and also the gifted craftspeople whose anonymous efforts contributed to Italy's singular stature in the realms of fashion and style. (This interview has been condensed and edited.)

Given all the attention paid to ""Made in Italy"" over the last few years, it seems almost wishful to posit style as an expression of nationality. ST But postwar Italian fashion was something very specific. From its beginnings, Italian fashion benefited from a very integrated system, starting with the fabrics and continuing to the designers and manufacturers. Wouldn't the same have been true of, say, France? ST When you think about the American or the French systems, they didn't have that organization, from designing fabrics to distribution. Often the fabrics they used were imported from Italy. A lot of French fabrics and even products were made in Italy. ST It was the high quality of the products and at an affordable price. After the war, during the '50s and '60s, Italy was full of very low-cost workers. Many had inherited family traditions of craftsmanship. The idea we had with this show was to demonstrate both the qualities and also the shortcomings of the Italian fashion system.

If traditions of quality craft were the positive, what was the negative? ST There was an overall lack of managerial experience, a lack of coordination. Some of it was the fault of the government, which didn't invest in infrastructure or education to bring Italian fashion to a level where it could compete with what was happening in other countries. But, where the government failed, Italian ingenuity stepped in. When you ask what Italian fashion was in that period, you could characterize it by saying Italy produced clothes of great quality at an affordable price. There was an incredible versatility in times of change -- the fact, say, that small Italian fashion companies could shift direction every six months, alter the kinds of product they were putting out.

ST Women were beginning to ask for a uniform to go to work. Italian manufacturers got the message and produced one. Men were asking for a new uniform to have fun. The Italians got the message and delivered it. How did you convey this in the show? ST The show is not chronological. It's organized by themes. There are nine rooms, and each looks at a specific moment in Italian history and how fashion mirrored it. There is the concept of identity, of democracy, of the global versus the local, and how Italian fashion dealt with the theories of postproduction. Maria Luisa and I were in the exhibition today looking at the actual clothes, and what was so striking was how many manage to look handmade yet had been produced on an industrial scale. You see a pair of Ferragamo shoes, and they have a handcrafted quality. Yet there was an industrial capacity in delivering it. Italian ingenuity as a premise, rather than the usual cliches about an Italian penchant for beauty? Maria Luisa Frisa It's about Italy solving problems. Designers of all kinds would come to Italy from all over the world because there is the industrial structure there to make idea reality. ST After the war, a big emphasis was given to small family companies and not the big industrial complex. You could make things in small artisan shops.

By shops you mean mills and factories, as is still the case? MLF Yes. Americans have always been great at producing in mass. But who pays attention to the quality of the fabric or the buttonholes the way Italians do? Nobody does. And yet in the show you are talking aesthetics but also an ethos that might apply to industrial design? MLF When you look at some of the Gianfranco Ferre clothes and the Giorgio Armani clothes we used in the show, you'll see they're almost designed like a chair. ST Italian designers in this period were thinking about Italian identity in much the same way industrial architects and designers were. They were thinking about fashion but also about furnishing the body. This was happening within the context of a conversation simultaneously going on with the contemporary art of the period, which is why the show also features art work and photography. Isn't this evolution to some degree a result of post-Marshall Plan reconstruction? ST Suddenly designers here were thinking about Italian identity. They were weighing what kind of impact an increasingly global system would have on them. Probably without thinking about it much, they were absorbing all kinds of influences and Italianizing them. When you look at Versace, it's incredible what he was putting into the clothes. There is the history of Magna Graecia. There is Hollywood glamour. There are the tropical colors of Miami. He was pairing bluejeans denim with beautiful silks from Lake Como, fabrics with 100 or more colors that can only be made in Italy.

So this ""Italianness,"" if that's what it is, becomes both platform and filter. ST That's why we call it the history of Italy in fashion. It was fascinating to look at the recent documentary on Gianni Agnelli and how it demonstrates Italy going from being a place that was all in black and white to a place that was full of color. There is a lot of darkness in the history of Italy in the 20th century, even into the '70s, when you had both the extreme left Red Brigades but also -- something everyone forgets -- the Fascists. There had been these bleak times, and suddenly there was prosperity. Italians could now afford to travel. They could think again about things like luxury.

ST And create beauty. There are magical designers like Romeo Gigli, who is, unfortunately, a little bit forgotten. We talk a lot in the show, too, about anonymous authorship in the industry. ST There are the name designers, of course. But there are companies where it hardly matters who the designer happens to be.

You mean, as though there some kind of industrial intelligence underpinning the enterprise? ST There is a signature to Italian fashion that goes beyond a ""Made in Italy"" label. There is know-how and a level of understanding. That's why so many fashion prototypes are still made in Italy. Italians are industrially nimble. They're intuitive and good at finding solutions.

Economy,"Hiring Rises, but Number of Jobless Stays High",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/05/business/economy/jobs-report-for-march.html,"Employers are hiring at a more aggressive pace again after a winter cold snap, but the pace of job gains is only slowly making up for years of lost ground in the labor market. Nearly five years after the end of the Great Recession, the total number of private sector jobs is finally back to where it was as the downturn began in early 2008, the Labor Department reported on Friday. But that level is still far below what is needed to fully accommodate the millions of people who have joined the work force since then, or relieve the backlog of jobless workers anytime soon. Still, the addition of 192,000 jobs last month, all from private employers, represented an uptick from the anemic rate of job creation recorded at the turn of the year. That encouraged optimists, who foresee a slight strengthening as the wintry weather in many parts of the country in late 2013 and early 2014 yields to a more inviting spring.

In addition, while the unemployment rate remained flat at 6.7 percent in March, an increase in the number of Americans looking for work also offered up some modest hope that better times could lie ahead in 2014. So too did an upward revision in the number of jobs that government statisticians estimate were added in January and February. ""We've gotten back to where we were before the winter slowdown in terms of job creation -- as well as where we expect to be going forward,"" said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays. ""This gets us back on trend."" Statistically speaking, the estimated rate of job creation in March was nearly identical to the average monthly gain of 183,000 jobs recorded over the last 12 months.

""Growth-wise, in terms of the economy and the labor market, we think 2014 will look a lot like 2013 and 2012 did,"" said Guy Berger, United States economist at RBS Securities. ""In all likelihood, we will see average monthly job gains of a little north of 200,000 this year."" While that pace of job creation would gradually bring the unemployment rate down, it would take until nearly the end of the decade before the labor market returned to the level of robustness that prevailed in the mid-2000s, let alone the 1990s.

* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations. Experts with the Hamilton Project, a research group that is associated with the Brookings Institution in Washington, estimate that at the current rate it will take until early 2019 for the economy to accommodate new entrants into the work force and get back to where it was before the recession. While the Labor Department data showed that private payrolls in March stood at 116.09 million -- compared with 115.98 million as the recession began in January 2008 -- the size of the American work force has jumped by more than two million over the same period. Moreover, even as people joined the work force, millions of other Americans dropped out of it entirely in the last five years, having given up the search for work, and the question of just how many of them will ever return to full- or even part-time jobs is now being hotly debated in economic circles. The participation rate did edge up in March as more workers returned to the labor market amid increased openings, a central reason the unemployment rate remained flat even as a survey of households suggested that nearly half a million people found new jobs last month. The return of Americans to the job hunt not only underscores just how much slack remains in the economy but also means that the unemployment rate is unlikely to keep falling as sharply as it has in the last two years. That's because people who are again looking for work are counted as unemployed, while those who have given up and dropped out of the labor force are not. The plunge in the unemployment rate -- to 6.7 percent, from 8.2 percent in March 2012 -- has encouraged policy makers at the Federal Reserve to slowly begin easing back on their stimulus efforts. But even as that so-called tapering process is likely to continue for the remainder of 2014, stabilization of the unemployment rate between 6.5 and 7 percent would encourage the Fed to be in no hurry to begin raising short-term interest rates.

The government conducts two separate surveys each month to come up with the jobs figures -- the figures for job creation come from the poll of private firms and the public sector, while the household survey yields the unemployment rate and more granular data on the work force itself. While the two move in tandem over time, the household survey in March was especially encouraging, showing an increase of 503,000 in the labor force, including 476,000 who reported they had found jobs.

On Wall Street, stocks initially traded higher after the Labor Department report, only to turn sharply lower in the afternoon with profit-taking in the highflying social media and biotech sectors. Hiring in March was paced by gains in construction, retail and professional services. Government employment over all remained flat, with federal and state governments shedding 11,000 jobs even as local governments added the same number. Over the last 12 months, total federal employment has fallen by 85,000. For nonsupervisory manufacturing workers, the length of the typical workweek rose to 42 hours, tying a postwar high and setting the pace for a slight gain in the workweek for workers in every sector. Across the economy, average hourly earnings in March were basically flat but the increase in hours meant slightly fatter paychecks over all. One especially strong sector in March was the broad professional and business services category, where employment rose by 57,000. Over the last two years, companies have added more than 1.2 million workers in this heavily white-collar category. At Hagie Manufacturing, a farm equipment maker in Clarion, Iowa, that hired 12 workers last month, most of the new positions were in areas like marketing and engineering, rather than on the production line. And those jobs are heavily sought after, according to the company's chief executive, Alan Hagie. In the last 12 months, the company has hired 83 workers, bringing its total work force to 488; the company received 2,800 resumes for these openings.","Better weather encouraged employers to begin hiring workers more aggressively in March, adding 192,000 to payrolls.

Music,5 K-pop Acts to Watch at KCON 2018,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/arts/music/kcon-kpop-preview.html,"When BTS's ""Love Yourself: Tear"" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart in May, K-pop began yet another serious bid for American mainstream acceptance, six years after the breakout of Psy's viral hit ""Gangnam Style."" But for hundreds of thousands of American K-pop fans, BTS arrived in the U.S. long before -- as part of the 2014 Los Angeles KCON lineup. KCON, a festival that brings Korean pop stars into proximity with its die-hard fans, has grown exponentially from its inaugural 2012 edition in L.A. into a globe-trotting envoy reaching K-pop fans in Japan, the United Arab Emirates, France, Mexico and Australia. Last year it attracted 43,000 to the Prudential Center in Newark, where it will return for the fourth consecutive year this weekend. The East Coast version of the event showcases popular and emerging acts that might not draw well enough outside South Korea to independently tour the States on their own. Here is a sampling of acts worthy of note:

Heize isn't the typical K-pop act American fans have been exposed to or seek out, which is to say she isn't what the Koreans would call an ""idol."" But her last few singles have swept the South Korean charts. Singing and rapping over a fusion of pop, hip-hop and jazz, Heize draws on an eclectic mix of genres yet doesn't fit squarely into any one. Her music is dulcet enough for the coffee shop set, but still has a bite. Before she started releasing a streak of No. 1 hits in South Korea, including ""Star"" and ""Don't Know You,"" she competed on the TV show ""Unpretty Rapstar 2"" and finished a semifinalist.

Unconventionally campy but wildly popular, this quintet sidesteps the usual persona for K-pop girl groups (cutesy and sexy), landing on an aesthetic that alternates between quirky and soulful. Some of their best-known tracks are similarly unorthodox for the genre: ""Red Flavor"" was conceived originally for the British group Little Mix by the Swedish songwriting and producing team Caesar & Loui and ""Bad Boy"" came from the Stereotypes (a crew that won a Grammy for its work with Bruno Mars). [Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.]

Super Junior is one of the boy bands that's ruled K-pop for much of the past decade, but is lesser known among newer American K-pop fans because its members have been taking turns completing South Korea's compulsory military service. It's had as many as 13 members at its peak (15 if you count its Chinese affiliate), but currently boasts a roster of seven. The group's 2009 smash ""Sorry, Sorry"" was instrumental in spreading the Korean wave across Southeast Asia.

This group caught its big break in 2014, when cellphone footage of a mesmerizing live performance of ""Up & Down"" by one of its members, Hani, went viral and racked up more than 26 million views on YouTube. Up to that point, the group had toiled for three fruitless years and saw personnel changes both in its lineup and management (half its original members bolted to launch a separate group, Bestie). Armed with powerful vocals, impeccable choreography and one of K-pop's most legit female M.C.s, EXID seized its breakthrough moment and cranked out edgy songs like ""Ah Yeah"" and ""Hot Pink.""

The reality competition TV show ""Produce 101"" has been something of a national obsession in South Korea, inviting comparisons to ""American Idol."" The inaugural season spawned the girl group I.O.I, and last year it introduced the boy band Wanna One. Made up of the top 11 out of 101 contestants, Wanna One has scored four consecutive No. 1 releases in South Korea.",American audiences often get their first exposure to K-pop's rising stars at this annual festival.

Automobiles,Landing Spot in America Is Elusive for Formula One,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/automobiles/landing-spot-in-america-is-elusive-for-formula-one.html,"FORMULA ONE racing, the most sophisticated and expensive of all motor sports, but one that has had only mixed success in the United States, returns to this country in two weeks after a five-year absence. The series, which awards the World Drivers and Constructors championships, has struggled to find a permanent home in the United States. There are several reasons for this, but a principal one has been lack of a suitable circuit in a good-sized metropolitan area. That part of the problem may be solved by the Circuit of the Americas, a new 3.4-mile, 20-turn course outside Austin, the Texas state capital. . On Nov. 18 the track will host the next-to-last race of the season -- quite possibly the race where the tight 2012 championship will be decided. The failure of the Formula One series to settle into a permanent home for its stop in the United States is not a result of indifference to auto racing here. There are at least a dozen varieties of motor sports extant in the United States, some of them having been contested for more than a century.

According to the National Speedway Directory, there are more than 1,300 racing facilities in the country, with events for vehicles of all descriptions. The Austin track has a 10-year contract to stage a Formula One race, and its investors hope to make a small, but nevertheless permanent, dent in a part of the country dominated by Nascar. In addition to Austin, there are plans for a second championship event in the United States starting in 2014. Called the Grand Prix of America at Port Imperial, it is to be held on a 3.2-mile street circuit straddling the New Jersey cities of Weehawken and West New York, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan. Originally scheduled for June 2013, the race was postponed for what promoters called ""ongoing construction issues.""

When the international drivers championship was inaugurated in 1950, it was unlikely that many Americans took note. At the time, racing in the United States was almost exclusively limited to oval tracks, and what transpired in Europe was of little interest. Formula One -- the name of the regulations that governed the championship, from the French Formule Un, in the official language of the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile -- was a term known to hardly anyone in this country.

In that first season, five years after World War II ended, it was a European-oriented series of six well-established races and the Indianapolis 500, which ran under different rules but was included in the points calculation to give some credence to the title. (Indianapolis proved to be a sort of motorized asterisk; in the 11 years its results counted, only one European driver took part and did not score a point.) The circuits present at the beginning were in Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland and Monaco. That might have made the new series international, but its world covered, in real terms, little more than the roughly 700 miles from London to Milan. Now in its seventh decade, the championship has graduated to a 20-race season that includes stops in Abu Dhabi, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and eight races in Europe. Over the years, there have been a number of attempts to find a permanent home in the United States. Sebring, Fla., was the first in 1959, and after that came Riverside, Calif., and then Watkins Glen in the Finger Lakes region of New York. The Watkins Glen setting was much loved by drivers, teams and spectators, but it was not a financial success. And it was not a favorite of the man who has controlled the sport as head of the Formula One Constructors Association, Bernard Ecclestone. Watkins Glen declared bankruptcy after the 1980 season, and for the last three decades Formula One racing has wandered the country, some years with two events, some with none. There have been races in Long Beach, Calif.; Detroit; Dallas; and Phoenix, and even the parking lot of a Las Vegas casino. The race eventually landed at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 2000, where a cramped road circuit that used a portion of the Speedway oval was created along with pit and garage improvements. The event remained there for seven years, in an increasingly acrimonious -- and financially unsuccessful -- atmosphere. At Indianapolis, the Formula One race was only the third-biggest event at the track, behind the annual 500-mile race and Nascar's 400-mile stock car event. The 2007 race was the last one in the United States until now. The principal elements of the Austin complex are done -- the circuit, the grandstands, the garage area and the pits. The expected crowd of 120,000, according to the promoters, may find it somewhat dusty, and the access roads are reported to be inadequate, but some grass and additional asphalt can cure this. The Austin investors, who include B. J. McCombs, the former San Antonio Spurs and Minnesota Vikings owner, have 10 years to plant and pave.","Formula One racing has struggled to find a permanent home in the United States, but it is returning in two weeks after a five-year absence.",2ee35ec3-3e89-588e-81d5-58c2f6194a68,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/11/04/automobiles/04INSI/04INSI-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=374&w=600&s=8f4870e4159e277e5fd7c04c03b579b1ac28d363090bda72bd40c1cc4845b8ae&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"WARP SPEED Mario Andretti drove the Circuit of the Americas near Austin, Tex., in a vintage Lotus 79 last month.

Dance,Review: Balanchine and Shakespeare Catch Some Waves in Miami,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/21/arts/dance/review-balanchine-and-shakespeare-catch-some-waves-in-miami.html,"MIAMI -- As if to illustrate the effects of climate change, Miami City Ballet has set its new production of George Balanchine's two-act ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" underwater. Transposing the action to the waterways of South Florida, the production is a peak of this company's 30th-anniversary season. Although the staging does not makes much sense on its own terms and in no way improves the ballet, its daftness is agreeably harmless: You can vaguely enjoy some of its fantasies while seriously loving the choreography. And the Miamians' dancing has all the wonderful immediacy that makes this company valuable.

When Balanchine choreographed Shakespeare's play in 1962, he honored both the classical-mythological Greek era in which it was set (Theseus, Hippolyta) and the medieval-Renaissance framework of its telling (Chaucer's ""Knight's Tale"" as well as Shakespeare). The multilayered sense of history (the choreography is evidently of its own day) is part of the charm. Though the original sets, by David Hays, and costumes, by Karinska, are still honored by New York City Ballet and other companies, they aren't sacrosanct, and they've been successfully replaced, as in Pacific Northwest Ballet's 1997 version, with its sets and costumes by Martin Pakledinaz.

For this Miami production, the dramaturgy is by Tarell Alvin McCraney, the scenery and costumes are by Michele Oka Doner, and the projections are by Wendall Harrington. When they sometimes refer to the classical/Renaissance time frame, the tone is pleasantly sardonic. Titania is first seen in a frothy farthingale. The one time we see architecture, at the start of Act II, it's a dim view of submerged classical ruins.

Bottom is transformed (his head only) into a Thurber-like seal rather than an ass; Hippolyta's hunt features not hounds but sea horses; the changing views in the background suggest bubbles and marine fauna rising to an unseen surface. The fairies, most in various shades of white, suggest the gleam of darting silver fish. (In general, the colors are too monochrome, and with too many distressed skirts.) Oberon's outsize crown is foolish; the knee-length skirt Titania wears for her first important dance robs her choreography of some of the spectacular scale it has in the usual ankle-length frock.

Travel,We Can Still Travel — With Photoshop and a Dream,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/travel/coronavirus-fake-travel.html,"Travel and travel planning are being disrupted by the worldwide spread of the coronavirus. For the latest updates, read The New York Times's Covid-19 coverage here. On March 19, Marty Pollak and Monica Palenzuela journeyed from New York City to Patagonia, where they hiked the Perito Moreno Glacier, explored Torres del Paine and hung out with a herd of guanacos. Santiago and Buenos Aires were next. Although stay-at-home mandates, travel restrictions and social distancing had become a new reality for billions of people all over the world, Mr. Pollak and Ms. Palenzuela's five-month trip was very much alive -- on Instagram. Guided by their canceled itinerary, the couple has been posting meticulously staged (and often Photoshopped) images and videos of themselves enjoying what would have been their adventure: say, gazing at a snow-capped peak, getting lost while hiking and taking a bus ride to Puerto Natales, Chile.

""You plan and God laughs,"" said Ms. Palenzuela, 35, who is studying to be a winemaker. ""But we've found joy in looking at what would have been. Seeing the itinerary day by day has helped us realize two things: One, this would have been an epic trip, and two, we can do it another year."" With little choice but to stay grounded for the time being -- and with plenty of time at home -- avid travelers like Mr. Pollak and Ms. Palenzuela have devised creative and meaningful ways to celebrate the vacations they have had to cancel because of the coronavirus pandemic.

""We travel to escape -- to unwind -- but also to feel the thrill of doing something entirely new. So why not fake a vacation, if only to laugh and smile and feel something good for a minute? I'd plan a 'fauxcation' every day,"" said Laura Dannen Redman, the digital content director at Afar, a travel media company. As technology becomes an increasingly critical tool for everyone and everything, celebrations of ""fauxcations"" on social media are increasing. A video of a septuagenarian Australian couple -- feet up, wearing robes, holding wine glasses and watching a YouTube video of the ocean on a flat-screen TV -- went viral when their daughter tweeted: ""Cruise cancelled? No problem.""

Others, like Nina Irizarry, take a more intimate approach. Ms. Irizarry, 35, nervously monitored the news in early March until it became clear that her Jordan trip with EscapingNY, a small-group tour operator, was a no-go for April. ""I was definitely disappointed, but I also felt a sense of peace because I knew this was the right decision. This is a time for me to protect myself and do what's best for other people, including my family. Jordan's not going anywhere,"" said Ms. Irizarry, the founder of Du Coeur Magazine, an arts and culture publication. Then, much to her delight, she received a care package with Jordanian tea and spices, plus a recipe for maqluba, a rice-based dish served throughout the Levant, from the EscapingNY founder, Cassandra Brooklyn. ""I know how disappointed everyone is, and I'm hoping the care packages provide them with something to look forward to and enjoy right now, since so many of us are stuck waiting around until things get better,"" Ms. Brooklyn said.

Ms. Irizarry, who loves to cook, spent the last Sunday in March putting the recipe to use in her Astoria, N.Y., kitchen. ""'Maqluba' literally means 'upside down' in Arabic. So creating this dish was a testament to the discipline, memory and anticipation of a trip to Jordan with EscapingNY. Perhaps, in today's times, it was also a testament to a world turned upside down,"" she said. Ad-libbing also has its merits. After canceling their stay at Twin Farms, an adults-only Relais & Chateaux retreat in Vermont, Ross and Jordi McGraw reenacted parts of their romantic getaway at Mr. McGraw's parents' house in Pennsylvania, where they had decamped to self-quarantine. After putting their toddler son to bed, the McGraws cracked open some nice wine (carted, with other essentials, from their Manhattan apartment). The bucolic setting and mountain views rang faintly of Vermont. A Jacuzzi added a dash of five-star-ish luxury. And the movie ""My Friend Dahmer,"" about the serial killer and sex offender Jeffrey Dahmer, stood in for Twim Farms' annual Murder Mystery Weekend -- Ms. McGraw, a freelance writer, loves murder mysteries. ""It was quite the opposite of the weekend we had planned,"" Ms. McGraw, 33, said. ""But you can only stress about things so much; we were lucky that we had a place to go, that we were all healthy and safe, and that we had a sleeping baby."" Ms. McGraw knows she'll eventually make it to Twin Farms, which ranks high on her travel bucket list. EscapingNY has rescheduled Ms. Irizarry's Jordan tour for later this year. And Mr. Pollak and Ms. Palenzuela remain hopeful that at least some part of their nearly half-year sabbatical -- which would have taken them from Europe and the Middle East to Hawaii, and eventually to Vietnam -- will materialize. ""In our mind, we're not thinking of it as canceled. As delusional as that sounds, I think that's what's helping us stay sane. Everything seems bleak right now, so we figure we'd do our part and stay inside, lay low and see what happens,"" Ms. Palenzuela said.

That attitude tracks with new data from TripScout, a travel app that builds personalized itineraries. In an online survey administered between March 13 and March 22, 77 percent of the nearly 3,000 respondents said they had to cancel or reschedule existing travel plans because of the coronavirus. Yet 90 percent of the respondents said they still plan on traveling in 2020. To fill that limbo, ongoing coronavirus-related efforts from travel companies and cultural institutions have made it easier than ever to transform real trips into virtual ones.","There's little choice now but to stay grounded because of the coronavirus, but avid travelers are devising creative and meaningful ways to celebrate the vacations they have had to cancel.",215df5f8-8df6-5998-a215-4ab07005bb49,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/07/travel/07vacations-honored-diptych/07vacations-honored-diptych-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=e748a589304165d5a35c6eb73ce0bd9e8bcd963a59146eda1f7a65dd737859d5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Monica Palenzuela and Marty Pollak in Brooklyn, despite appearances.",215df5f8-8df6-5998-a215-4ab07005bb49,N24News/imgs/215df5f8-8df6-5998-a215-4ab07005bb49.jpg,4

Travel,What to See in Muhammad Ali's Louisville,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/08/travel/what-to-see-in-muhammad-alis-louisville.html,"Fans of Muhammad Ali, the three-time world heavyweight boxing champion who died on June 3, have been flocking to Louisville, Ky., to pay their respects and to learn more about his hometown roots.

There are three main attractions, but many other places of interest for visitors, according to Stacey Yates, vice president of marketing communications for the Louisville Convention and Visitors Bureau.

The Muhammad Ali Center, part of Museum Row on Main, offers an immersive look at Ali's boyhood in Louisville, his boxing career and his lifetime humanitarian achievements. Cassius Clay, as he was known then, got his start in boxing at age 12, as the story goes, after his new $60 red and white Schwinn bicycle was stolen, and the police officer he sought out to help find his bike encouraged him to start boxing. A replica of the bike is on display at the Ali Center.

""For many,"" Ms. Yates said, ""it's a boxing museum. But it really takes you on a journey of his lifetime, from the bicycle to him holding the torch at the 1996 Olympics.""","Fans of the late heavyweight champion can visit the Muhammad Ali Center as well as his childhood home, among other sites in Louisville.",11dedb0a-6ab9-5829-b806-cad224cfef53,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/07/travel/07WTG-ALI/07WTG-ALI-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=952a213b695eff76a1d3e5db139f7f8bc5b8c10e4e406ca21f235e45257dba2e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A memorial for Muhammad Ali at the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville.,11dedb0a-6ab9-5829-b806-cad224cfef53,N24News/imgs/11dedb0a-6ab9-5829-b806-cad224cfef53.jpg,4
Opinion,Can Anyone Save the G.O.P.?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/17/opinion/bill-weld-new-hampshire-primary.html,"Bill Weld, the former Massachusetts governor and current long-shot -- make that, loooooooong-shot -- candidate for the Republican Party's presidential nomination, is a keen student of New Hampshire politics. In an interview with me this week, he noted the following fact: Every time an incumbent president of either party faced a significant primary challenge in the Granite State, he failed in his bid for re-election. It happened to George H.W. Bush in 1992 after Patrick Buchanan took 38 percent of the New Hampshire vote. It happened to Jimmy Carter in 1980 after Teddy Kennedy took 39 percent. It happened to Gerald Ford in 1976 after Ronald Reagan took 48 percent. It happened to Lyndon Johnson in 1968 after Eugene McCarthy took 42 percent. It happened to Harry Truman in 1952 when Estes Kefauver beat him outright, 55 percent to 44.

So, Weld reasons, why not try to make it happen to Donald J. Trump, too? That's the hopeful thought in what otherwise seems to be Weld's hopeless bid to derail a president whose support among Republicans was 89 percent last month, according to Gallup. Weld is too much a politician to admit publicly that he sees no shot for himself of winning -- a Messiah complex lies at the root of many monumental ambitions. But he's also wise enough to know that losing well can achieve great things, like bringing down a president who, he said, ""regards the law as something to be evaded."" Can that be done between now and Feb. 11, the date of the New Hampshire primary? Weld rests his hopes on two things: New England Republicanism, which remains alive and well despite reports of its demise; and Trump's trial in the Senate, whose result may not yet be a foregone conclusion. On the former, note that Vermont, Massachusetts and New Hampshire all have G.O.P. governors, who, like Weld, are relative moderates compared to the rest of the party. New England Republicans can also be fickle in their loyalties, and late to make up their minds: Buchanan was also seen as a nonstarter against Bush Sr. just weeks before the 1992 primary. On the latter, Weld knows a lot about the impeachment process, having worked on the House Judiciary Committee's staff as a young lawyer in 1974 as it considered articles against Richard Nixon. Nixon, Weld recalled, ""was essentially forced to withdraw from the presidency because he had been caught lying on television to the American people on one topic"" -- a foothill of a deception compared to Trump's Karakoram range. Weld also knows how quickly things can turn in the course of a trial. ""Cases don't look the same at the end as they do at the beginning,"" he noted, recalling his prosecutions of public corruption in the 1980s as United States attorney for the District of Massachusetts, where he won 109 convictions in 111 corruption cases. He believes that if four Republican senators join Democrats in voting to call witnesses -- Ohio's Rob Portman could provide the decisive vote -- then anything is possible.

""The one sport where the unthinkable can become the inevitable in a matter of weeks or even days,"" Weld said, ""is national politics, not the National Football League."" Maybe that's right, assuming devastating testimony from John Bolton, the former national security adviser; former Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas; and who knows who (or what) else. Not that any kind of testimony is likely to sway the 67 senators needed for a conviction. But it's not quite out of the question that it might, in the coming weeks, sway a large fraction of New Hampshire Republicans to vote against the president, thereby setting into motion forces that could bring him down. That's the hope, at any rate. The odds against? I'd say 20 to 1 -- which is to say, still worth a shot. If it fails, Weld said he would not run as an independent. Unlike in 2016, when he ran with Gary Johnson on the Libertarian ticket (and won 4.5 million votes) he has no interest in playing the spoiler to anyone in the race except Trump. The larger question if it fails is what becomes of the G.O.P. Weld compared the party to the late-stage Whigs of the early 1850s, which were riven between the nativist Know Nothing faction and the antislavery wing that would become the Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln. Fortunately, the good side won that time. And this time? The best conservative case for rooting for a Democrat to win this fall -- any Democrat, including Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren -- is that it might be the only way to save the Republican Party from itself. That could happen if a critical mass of conservatives repudiates Trumpism or forms a new party on the Lincoln model. Weld calls it the Liberty Party. Alternatively a Sanders or Warren victory could send the G.O.P. to even further extremes. In politics, as in nature, forces always come in pairs. Democrats who want to see Republicans recover their center need to protect their own. In the meantime, wish Bill Weld well in his Granite State carom shot.

Dance,"Review: 'The Return of La Argentina,' a Solo Dance Fed by Chips and Pistachios",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/27/arts/dance/review-the-return-of-la-argentina-a-solo-dance-fed-by-chips-and-pistachios.html,"""I've discovered that if I have a little bit of potato chip, and orange juice from two bottles, the dance goes better,"" the choreographer Trajal Harrell said. He was explaining his actions to an audience in a tucked-away gallery at the Museum of Modern Art on Sunday, at the start of his latest work, ""The Return of La Argentina.""

The dance, of course, had already begun. And the chips and juice, which Mr. Harrell consumed while crouched over a stash of provisions, were a kind of mundane entry into a series of less prosaic, more enigmatic tasks, through which he channeled the ghosts of soloists past.

You wouldn't know from its surface that ""The Return of La Argentina"" was inspired by ""Admiring La Argentina,"" a 1979 solo by the Japanese dancer Kazuo Ohno, which was itself inspired by the Spanish dancer Antonia Merce, known as La Argentina. Mr. Ohno was a pioneer of the postwar Japanese dance-theater form Butoh, along with Tatsumi Hijikata, who is the focus of Mr. Harrell's two-year residency at the Modern, and who directed ""Admiring La Argentina"" in its premiere. Just a little context.

Meandering though it is, that back story illuminates what might otherwise be a thoroughly inscrutable if intriguing solo. Mr. Harrell first appeared waltzing toward us through an adjacent room, clutching a ruffled pink dress, like a flamenco dancer's, to the front of his body. He would later coyly disappear along the same pathway. All of this, and much else in the roughly half-hour work, might have seemed insubstantial if not for his unflinching conviction. He moves as if nothing else matters.","The choreographer Trajal Harrell performed this work at the Museum of Modern Art, where he has a two-year residency.",75c6b6fa-5eac-516b-9803-4412a7777ade,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/27/arts/27HARRELL/27HARRELL-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=c3f7d6df8bb6cf167d2f8bcefb613006bd3c9c81af91526218ddec96ad80327f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Trajal Harrell performing ""The Return of La Argentina"" at the Museum of Modern Art.",75c6b6fa-5eac-516b-9803-4412a7777ade,N24News/imgs/75c6b6fa-5eac-516b-9803-4412a7777ade.jpg,6
Music,"Review: Good Music, but Julia Bullock Makes It Great",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/16/arts/music/review-julia-bullock-met-museum.html,"The most telling moment in Julia Bullock's recital on Saturday evening at the Metropolitan Museum of Art came before she'd sung a note.

Featuring settings of the words of black artists from the South and fresh versions of traditional slave songs, this was the first concert in the superb rising soprano's season-long residency at the Met. The five-event series continues on Dec. 2 with a program of new works with texts by Langston Hughes.

You would expect a musician to bathe in at least a little bit of entrance applause at this, the opening event of one of her most prominent New York showcases to date. But with the lights still up in the auditorium, Ms. Bullock modestly entered with the nine string players. The music began without her swanning on solo -- in fact, without any clapping at all.

Ms. Bullock seemed to be emphasizing that, at the Met, she would truly be an artist, not a diva, in residence. It's not that she's a reticent singer, but she exudes humility. She serves the work she's singing, even as she makes it better.",The rising soprano opened her season-long residency at the Metropolitan Museum of Art with slave songs and settings of the words of black artists.,ea512491-0ece-55e2-a7e9-acab2a08cd06,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/17/arts/17Bullock-promo/17Bullock-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=84449daf60973b76b378d38bb7d535e0b9080cea5f519a4779fbddb86b610151&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The soprano Julia Bullock at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Saturday.

Sports,N.F.L. Week 15 Predictions: Our Picks Against the Spread,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/17/sports/football/nfl-picks-week-15.html,"A Thursday matchup that needed overtime to be decided. A pair of entertaining games on Saturday. A potential Super Bowl preview on Sunday. This is shaping up to be an excellent week of football, and we dug in on each team's playoff chances using The Upshot's playoff simulator. Here is a look at N.F.L. Week 15, with all picks made against the spread.

The Saints (10-3) are hopeful that Brees, who hasn't played since Week 10, can make his triumphant return this week so he can lead them in a potential Super Bowl preview against the Chiefs (12-1). The Upshot gives the Chiefs a 23 percent chance of repeating as champions, while the Saints, at 16 percent, are considered the most likely winner out of the N.F.C. At their best, both teams have explosive offenses and opportunistic defenses. If the Chiefs have a fatal flaw, it is their boredom, but a road game against a top competitor should keep their attention. So where does that leave this game? It depends on Brees's health. If he plays, and is close to 100 percent, you have to give the Saints a decent chance of an upset. Anything less than that, and a motivated Chiefs team could romp. Pick: Chiefs -3

In a convincing win over Minnesota last week, the Buccaneers (8-5) showed how effective their pass rush can be in creating the disruptions necessary to win tough games. Kirk Cousins was under pressure all game, and even though the Vikings moved the ball well, they couldn't punch the ball into the end zone. A similar script could play out against the Falcons (4-9), who are a threat in any home game but are prone to problems against Tampa Bay's pass rush because of quarterback Matt Ryan's lack of mobility. The Buccaneers are up to a 94 percent chance of ending their 12-season playoff drought, but the line may be too aggressive this week. Pick: Falcons +6 Even with last week's heartbreaking loss to Baltimore, the Browns (9-4) have matched the franchise's best 13-game start since 1994, when Coach Bill Belichick led them to an 11-5 record and a trip to the divisional round of the playoffs. On the strength of its record, Cleveland has an 84 percent chance of making the playoffs for the first time since 2007. While the Giants (5-8) have made a remarkable turnaround from earlier this season, and have a 25 percent chance of winning the N.F.C. East, they are overmatched in this one. Pick: Browns -4

Carolina's defense just got shredded by Denver's Drew Lock, so it's hard to imagine the pain Aaron Rodgers and the Packers (10-3) could inflict on the Panthers (4-9) if they were to go all-out. After New Orleans's loss last week, Green Bay, which had already clinched the N.F.C. North, is in the driver's seat for a first-round bye. This game has the potential to be a trap, with the Packers looking ahead to a tougher matchup in Week 16 against Tennessee, but Rodgers has been locked in and may trail only Patrick Mahomes in the race for league most valuable player. Pick: Packers -8.5 It's hard to know how the Broncos (5-8) will play from week to week, but a road game in Denver is tough for any opponent, even one as good as the Bills (10-3). Add that the Bills can relax a little considering their 98 percent chance of winning the A.F.C. East (but just a 1 percent chance at a first-round bye), and this game could be closer than oddsmakers are predicting. Pick: Broncos +6.5

There were so many jokes. Lamar Jackson engineered one of the wildest wins in recent N.F.L. history, completing a 44-yard touchdown to Marquise Brown on fourth-and-5 with less than two minutes left in the game, then watching Cleveland tie the score, and then taking the Ravens far enough for Justin Tucker to kick a game-winning, 55-yard field goal. But all anyone wanted to talk about was Jackson's brief absence and how it looked as if he might have taken a bathroom break. Laugh all you want -- Jackson swears he was receiving fluids to alleviate cramping -- but the win was a welcome change in what had been a difficult period for the Ravens (8-5). Jackson finally looked like himself, and the Ravens, with a 74 percent chance of making the playoffs, no longer seemed like a team in peril. This game does not figure to be nearly as entertaining. The Jaguars (1-12) haven't won a game since Week 1, and struggle on both sides of the ball. Having Baltimore as a two-touchdown favorite when you consider the team's recent defensive struggles seems like a bit too much. Pick: Jaguars +14 In most years, this would be a key A.F.C. South matchup, but the Texans (4-9) have been eliminated from playoff contention and the Colts (9-4) have an 82 percent chance of making the playoffs and a 36 percent chance of winning their division. Houston's Deshaun Watson will be the best player on the field, but the Texans have done a shameful job of keeping talent around him. Indianapolis, on the other hand, made crucial personnel moves in the off-season that have taken the team from mediocre to top 10 in offense and defense. Pick: Colts -7 There are situations in which the Lions (5-8) could hold their own against the Titans (9-4), but most of them involve locking Tennessee's Derrick Henry in a well-guarded room and insisting nobody knows where he is. Barring high jinks, Detroit seems remarkably overmatched, especially if Matthew Stafford misses the game with the rib injury he sustained last week. Tennessee is in a tough fight with Indianapolis for the A.F.C. South crown, and has a 64 percent chance of holding off the Colts, so the Titans certainly have motivation to keep winning. Pick: Titans -10.5 Both teams are on the outside looking in, but the Bears (6-7) and the Vikings (6-7) are still alive, and both have at least a 20 percent chance of a playoff spot despite Chicago's recent struggles and Minnesota's rough start. Assuming the Bears' offensive resurgence last week was more than a blip would probably be generous, but they certainly have looked their best with Mitchell Trubisky at quarterback. Even accounting for that, Minnesota should be fine, provided the team gives quarterback Kirk Cousins more time to work than he had in a loss to Tampa Bay. Pick: Vikings -3

The Patriots (6-7) have missed the playoffs just twice since 2001, but even with a recent hot streak they are down to a 4 percent chance at qualifying this year, and that number will drop to zero with a loss to the Dolphins (8-5), who have a 43 percent chance at a wild card. The tables appear to have turned in this rivalry, with New England being the scrappy underdog that could spoil things for the seemingly superior team. Miami's style of play doesn't lead to many mistakes, so unless Coach Bill Belichick has something up his sleeve, the Patriots can start making vacation plans for early January. Pick: Dolphins -2.5 Sam Darnold feels like the Darkest Timeline version of Jared Goff. Instead of developing under the tutelage of an era-defining offensive genius like Coach Sean McVay, Darnold has been saddled with Coach Adam Gase, and the Jets (0-13) seem to have little chance of avoiding a winless season. The talent imbalance in this game -- reflected accurately in the point spread -- is extreme, and a win for Los Angeles (9-4) should help the team increase its 60 percent chance of winning the competitive N.F.C. West. A 17-point spread is absurd, but so are the Jets. Pick: Rams -17 When the schedule came out, this was supposed to showcase Jimmy Garoppolo leading the defending N.F.C. champions into Dak Prescott's house to rekindle a classic rivalry. Backup quarterback Nick Mullens facing off against Andy Dalton doesn't really live up to that advanced billing. Technically, neither team has been eliminated from playoff contention, with the 49ers (5-8) having a 9 percent chance at a wild-card spot and the Cowboys (4-9) having a 1 percent chance of winning the N.F.C. East. With San Francisco running back Raheem Mostert uncertain to play and wide receiver Deebo Samuel expected to be out, the Cowboys have a decent chance at a second straight win. Pick: Cowboys +2.5 Oklahoma Coach Lincoln Riley will love this one. Kyler Murray of the Cardinals (7-6) transferred to Oklahoma to play for Riley in 2017 and won the Heisman Trophy in 2018. Jalen Hurts of the Eagles (4-8-1) transferred to Oklahoma to play for Riley in 2019 and was a Heisman finalist. Hurts's promotion to starting quarterback for Philadelphia last week set up this matchup between two of Riley's star pupils, and while the over-under on this game isn't particularly high, you can expect plenty of highlight reel plays. Hurts has a chance to keep following in Murray's formidable footsteps, but right now Murray is a more complete player and the Cardinals are a better team. With Arizona's chance at a wild card around 50 percent, the team should be motivated to win at home. Pick: Cardinals -6.5

Things got complicated for Las Vegas when quarterback Derek Carr was removed from the game in the second quarter with a groin injury. But his backup, Marcus Mariota, put on quite a show. The No. 2 pick in the 2015 draft threw for 226 yards and a touchdown while running for 88 yards and another score. That was good enough to keep pace with Los Angeles throughout regulation -- with some help from Chargers kicker Michael Badgley, who missed go-ahead field goal attempts from 47 and 51 yards late in the fourth quarter. But all the Raiders could manage in overtime was a field goal, and that gave Justin Herbert his opening. Herbert, a rookie quarterback who has tantalized with his arm strength all season, showed off his aggressiveness by throwing deep to Jalen Guyton on the third play of his team's possession for a 53-yard gain that put Los Angeles on the Raiders' 2-yard line. It took a few tries, but Herbert eventually pushed the ball over the goal line on a 1-yard keeper to secure the 30-27 win. We picked Chargers +3.5 based on the team finally having ended a game well last week. This week's ending was even better.","Saturday games return, but this week is dominated by a potential Super Bowl preview between the Saints and the Chiefs.",c87adaad-5803-567e-99ca-5dd25493e014,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/17/sports/17nfl-matchups-top/17nfl-matchups-top-facebookJumbo.jpg,Drew Brees hasn't played since Week 10.

Food,A Life's Many Acts Culminate in the Kitchen at NA/NA in Paris,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/dining/nana-paris-nathaly-nicolas-ianniello.html,"When Nathaly Nicolas-Ianniello opened NA/NA in Paris in 2015, not only was it the first time she had ever worked as a chef, but it was her first job in a restaurant. A daring thing for anyone to do, but she was 52, and many of her friends thought she was nuts.

Like most French chefs, Ms. Nicolas-Ianniello started cooking when she was a child -- but not, as the cliche goes, at her grandmother's elbow amid the vapors of pot au feu.

""I don't have childhood memories of something smelling good in the cuisine,"" she said, using the French word for kitchen. Raised by a single mother in the Parisian suburb Marnes-la-Coquette, Ms. Nicolas-Ianniello grew up in the era of canned foods. Dinner often meant eggs at 9 p.m.

Television,'Star Trek: Discovery' Season Finale: Wrapping Up,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/11/arts/television/star-trek-discovery-season-1-episode-15-finale-recap.html,"The plot didn't make sense. The characters contradicted themselves again. And the pacing was all over the place. But man, the ""Discovery"" season finale -- ""Will You Take My Hand?"" -- was satisfying. It was one of the rare episodes of the show in which great care is given to individual characters and their story lines. We see Mary Chieffo's L'Rell given some meaty material as she tries to unite the Klingon houses under her leadership. Tyler and Burnham have a torturous goodbye. We even see Tilly retaining some of the confidence she attained from her Mirror Universe stint as a diabolical leader. There was also, thanks to Akiva Goldsman, who directed the episode, a very impressive exploration of a new world we haven't seen yet: the Orion-dominated area on Kronos. ""Discovery,"" as a show, hasn't cared as much about exploration as most Trek voyages. Given its superb visuals, watching the buddy cop group of Tyler, Evil Georgiou, Tilly and Tyler navigate unfamiliar territory was a ride worth being on. But more than anything, the last minute of the episode was the best moment in all of ""Discovery,"" and totally welcome fan service. We get our first peek of the Enterprise that we have known and loved for decades (Captain Pike was in charge, but still). Hats off to Goldsman for putting together, essentially, a perfect scene. We think the episode is over -- and that the Discovery is riding off into the sunset. But then a traditional Trek trope: a distress call, followed by a screen saying, ""NCC-17,"" which is the moment we realize what is coming. And then there is the Enterprise -- a remastered 2018 version that looks absolutely stunning.

The episode was still problematic -- mostly because the ""Discovery"" writers had to conclude story lines that were already sticky to begin with. The entire Klingon-Federation war comes to an end because L'Rell is given control of a bomb planted in the heart of Kronos by Evil Georgiou. She uses that control to unify the Klingon houses and end hostilities. But why? All L'Rell has wanted was to eliminate the Federation at all costs. Why would she be willing to end the war because she is given control of her entire race? And why would other Klingons unite around her, especially when she calls for ending the war that they had been winning (and presumably still are winning)? The season also ends with many unanswered questions, including an overarching one that never quite got an answer: At some point, we know something significant happens with Sarek and Burnham's relationship. This is why for decades, through multiple Trek franchises, we have never heard Sarek, Spock's father, mention Burnham. We don't get the answer. We also don't get an explanation for why Sarek's exchange with Burnham in last week's episode felt more like a goodbye. A guest appearance by the always funny Clint Howard as a devious Orion man added levity to a show mostly devoid of it. Howard has appeared in Trek before, as Uproxx's Alan Sepinwall reminded me. But it was great to see a recognizable, green face. The moment all of the Discovery crew started literally standing up on the bridge against Admiral Cornwell's greenlighting of genocide was so unnecessarily cheesy. Why did the crew start standing? There was no reason for it! Also, Cornwell was there via hologram. She wasn't even in the room! O.K., I'm being nitpicky. This isn't though: How did the crew, outside of the ones who knew, not realize Evil Georgiou was posing as the Georgiou they all loved? Evil Georgiou was being rude, abrasive and impulsive to the crew -- similar to how someone from the Terran Empire would act. And no one noticed or said anything.

Also, Cornwell greenlighting a genocide, given her speeches decrying Lorca's irrationality throughout the season, didn't wash with me. 2. Why not go to Tyler first? We observe a scene in which Evil Georgiou spends a few minutes pummeling L'Rell to get information out of her. This fails and then Burnham has an idea: Why not ask the Federation-officer-turned-Klingon-spy-turned-Federation-officer? And that's how they find what they need. Why didn't they think of that first? Or do both? As the war is wrapped up, we seem to have totally forgotten that a key member of the crew, Dr. Culber, was shockingly murdered and that the crew's captain, Lorca, was an impostor this whole time. Not even a remembrance! Out of sight, out of mind. Some thoughts as we come to the end of the ""Discovery"" maiden voyage: 1. As critical as I've been of the plot (which had canyon-sized holes) and the lack of consistent character development, it's important to remember that pretty much every Trek series struggled to find its footing early on. If weekly recaps existed when ""The Next Generation"" was on, they would have been brutal. Remember how the Ferengi were introduced in ""The Battle""? We don't know what ""Discovery"" will look like once it has reached its cruising altitude. But it has promise. The cast is there and the visuals are top-notch. ""Enterprise"" never found its footing. ""Deep Space Nine"" did. If I had to make a prediction, I'd put ""Discovery"" somewhere between those two. 2. I hope next season we get to learn more about the Discovery crew members, assuming that's where most of the action takes place. We didn't get to know Tilly, Saru and the others well. ""Trek"" has typically been about the ensemble more than one individual character. ""Discovery"" has so far mostly orbited around Burnham -- It is her love life we see develop. It is a war she instigated that we see. It is her mutiny that weighs on the crew. I'm looking forward to seeing plots that aren't Burnham-centric. 3. It's worth repeating: The team behind ""Discovery"" deserves a lot of credit for taking ambitious risks with this iteration of Trek. It is the darkest, most cynical expression of Gene Roddenberry's vision, and it has its own unique identity. The writers went out of their way to make this show different and not lean on traditional Trek tropes. More often than not, it didn't work. But the effort was there, which is what makes me hopeful for next season.",The Season 1 finale concluded a number of problematic story lines and brought back a very satisfying (and familiar) visual.,578161ff-be47-50fb-9922-490afc8f4e72,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/09/watching/11startrek-recap/12watching-slide-F6LG-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=78257e78006ffef69f3c478b8b13f17667b8d94cf4d233f8ce55a53f7c0a0fdc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sonequa Martin-Green, left, and James Frain in ""Star Trek: Discovery.""",578161ff-be47-50fb-9922-490afc8f4e72,N24News/imgs/578161ff-be47-50fb-9922-490afc8f4e72.jpg,3

On Wednesday at the Kitchen, Big Dance Theater turned an ordinary interval into an onstage party to celebrate the group's 25th-anniversary season. As force-fed as it was, it did create a rush of vitality that the works on the program, most of them brief, delivered only intermittently.

The focus in the first half of ""Big Dance: Short Form,"" directed and conceived by the husband-and-wife team of Annie-B Parson and Paul Lazar, was on movement-heavy works choreographed by Ms. Parson. (Inspirations included diary entries and folk tales.) The first four pieces were performed in quick succession with set changes conducted by agile cast members in white puffy coats; the aim here was to trade the standard evening-length formula for a traditional repertory lineup, the kind that was alive and well in the 1990s.","Big Dance Theater turned intermission into an onstage celebration of that group's 25th-anniversary season, bringing a rush of vitality to the program at the Kitchen.",4eb8be87-88e8-58b6-8ba4-8f6df1e8d53d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/08/arts/08BIGDANCE1/08BIGDANCE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=68ef5778994899ea9512bebe91903b46abd400f177333bed9a5f819cb40d007d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Aaron Mattocks in Big Dance Theater's ""Big Dance: Short Form.""",4eb8be87-88e8-58b6-8ba4-8f6df1e8d53d,N24News/imgs/4eb8be87-88e8-58b6-8ba4-8f6df1e8d53d.jpg,6

Food,How to Cook With Plant-Based Meats,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/dining/impossible-beyond-meat.html,"You may have tried restaurant versions, but making them at home is another matter. J. Kenji Lopez-Alt has tested them and offers practical advice.

SAN MATEO, Calif. -- Even before opening my restaurant, Wursthall, here a couple years ago, I knew that taking vegan and vegetarian options seriously -- with both traditionally vegan foods and modern meat alternatives -- would be a central element of its success. Though sausages form the backbone of the menu, my team and I believed that people who don't eat meat should be able to dine in mixed company without feeling that they were second-class citizens, or that their meal consisted of a series of side dishes, as they so often do at restaurants. For me, a food-science writer who is a chef on the side, this meant testing, and lots of it. Until recently, the faux-meat options -- plant-based alternatives designed to replicate the flavor, texture and appearance of meat -- have been abysmal. All that changed when two companies, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, introduced a new generation of vegan meat substitutes developed with tens of millions of dollars of funding and years of scientific research. [Read the results of our taste test of plant-based meats.] Both companies claim that their products behave just like beef -- with meaty flavor, juiciness and bloody red color -- and unlike other products, which come preformed as patties or meatballs, can be deployed in all kinds of recipes that call for ground beef. Some supermarkets even stock them in the meat department.

Over the past two-and-a-half years, my team has worked with thousands of pounds of the new products (which, for the sake of convenience, I'll refer to as vegan meat), developing dozens of dishes that have sold remarkably well. Our Impossible-based sandwiches sell at about half the rate of traditional burgers (our most popular sandwich), and better than our average sausage. And it's not just vegans ordering them. Even before that, I started my own experimentation with burgers, by far the most common way vegan meat is served. My first instinct was to use my favorite burger-making technique: smashing. By pressing balls of ground beef with a stiff spatula onto a hot steel griddle, letting them sizzle for a minute or so, then scraping them up with a razor-fitted wallpaper remover, you maximize meaty flavor through intense Maillard browning, the series of chemical reactions that give seared meats their characteristic brown color and complex flavor.

Eating them told a different story. There was no juiciness to speak of, and it seemed that, rather than making the patties taste meatier, the intense browning drove off moisture and flavor. The problem lies partly in the difference between beef fat and vegetable fats. Much of the flavor and rich texture in beef comes from fat and fat-soluble organic compounds. Beef fat starts to soften as it warms past room temperature, but doesn't fully liquefy until it's past 140 degrees (what would be considered medium-well for a steak), and that rendering process takes time. As a result, when you cook a beef burger, some of the fat melts out, helping the patty sizzle. But some of it merely softens and stays incorporated in the patty, keeping it juicy and flavorful even when cooked to medium (as long as it's served immediately). [Learn more about the science behind plant-based meats.] Coconut oil, the primary fat used in vegan meat, liquefies much faster and at a lower temperature, around 75 degrees for virgin oil and 105 degrees for hydrogenated oil. It runs out of thinner patties, leaving them dry and unpleasantly vegetal-tasting. Impossible and Beyond burgers really shine when they are formed into thicker patties that trap liquefied fat, are cooked no more than medium-rare and are paired with robustly flavored toppings.

But as good as a burger can be, a more forgiving way to serve vegan meat is in heavily seasoned dishes, like meatballs or meatloaf, especially if they include a starchy binder to help retain some of the fat and juices even when cooked well done. Think meatballs bound with bread crumbs and seasoned Italian-American style with plenty of garlic and Parmesan in a bright marinara sauce, or Swedish meatballs with warm spices and a rich mushroom gravy. I've made a variation of hambagu (a popular Japanese dish similar to Salisbury or Hamburg steak), flavored with soy sauce and porcini powder, that I've enjoyed more than the beef or pork original.

It's no coincidence that the most successful dishes I've made with plant-based meat have included ingredients like mushrooms, soy sauce, tomatoes and aged cheeses. All of these ingredients are rich in glutamates, the chemical compounds largely responsible for the mouthwatering savory flavor known as umami. (If you aren't averse to it, a sprinkle of monosodium glutamate, or MSG, can work wonders with vegan meat.) One of the more interesting, and expensive, experiments I've tried at Wursthall was cooking 15-pound blocks of seasoned Impossible meat on a vertical rotisserie in the style of doner kebab, the Turkish street food popular throughout much of Europe, especially Germany and Scandinavia. To make it, I heavily spiced the vegan meat with aromatics like garlic, oregano, cumin, sumac and chiles, molded it into the classic inverted cone shape, threaded it onto a vertical rotisserie, then let it rotate slowly in front of a flame. As the outer layers sizzled and crisped, I shaved them off with a knife and served them in sandwiches with sumac-seasoned onions, tomatoes, arugula and a garlicky sauce.

The sandwiches were delicious and, to my genuine surprise, the meat cone browned and held together just like traditional ground beef or lamb -- at least for the first 15 minutes or so. Eventually the fat melted out, and the meat started grotesquely sloughing off the cone. Adding a touch of transglutaminase (a common meat binder that chefs refer to as ""meat glue"") to the mix helped, but not much. Why didn't it work? Typically, those ground meat cones are made like sausages: Seasoned ground meat is mixed and kneaded until raw proteins begin to stretch and entangle with one another on a microscopic level, forming a sticky, cohesive texture that retains fat and moisture, and develops a springy bite when cooked. The plant proteins in Impossible and Beyond meats, on the other hand, are precooked, which makes it difficult for them to entangle. The same problem extended to all of our experiments in making vegan sausages and hot dogs, which come out grainier and softer than meat sausages. The most success we've had with sausages has been in adding a binding emulsion of flax seeds and oil to the mix. Beyond Meat offers its own preformed sausages that come close but fall short of mimicking a meat sausage, at least in direct, side-by-side comparisons. Impossible Foods recently introduced a vegan pork alternative that promises to work better for sausages, though I haven't had more than a cursory opportunity to experiment with it.

In a skillet, Impossible meat browns, renders fat, breaks up under a wooden spoon and cooks just like ground beef. Beyond Meat starts off a bit mushier and pastier, but once it starts cooking, it breaks up and browns just fine. Vegan meat is excellent in those Chinese recipes that rely on a sparing amount of ground meat to add flavor and texture to primarily plant-based dishes. Sichuan classics like dan dan noodles and mapo tofu, for instance, can be made completely vegan without any noticeable loss of flavor or texture. Even meat-forward dishes like Thai-style phat ka-phrao, in which ground meat is stir-fried with powerfully flavored ingredients like bird's-eye chiles, basil and fish sauce, are comparable to their meaty counterparts. I've seasoned vegan meat with dried chiles, cinnamon, oregano and cumin to make chorizo and potato tacos that sing with flavor. I've even tried it with that seasoning packet that comes in a boxed hard-shell taco kit. No complaints here (at least none that I wouldn't also have with the same kits using ground beef). In the end, as with any food, success in cooking vegan meats depends on the recipes and techniques used to prepare them. When made right, they hit those pleasure points -- the satisfying chew, the fatty richness, the juicy drips, the red color -- that up until now, vegan and vegetarian alternatives have lacked. As a chef who strives to reduce my own meat intake and offer plant-based dishes to as wide an audience as possible, I think modern vegan meat is among the most important technological leaps I've seen in my career. And if sales figures are any indication, the incentive to produce ever-better versions shows no sign of flagging.","You may have tried restaurant versions, but making them at home is another matter.

Dance,Sulking and Buzzing in the Service of the Story,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/arts/dance/xavier-le-roys-retrospective-at-moma-ps1.html,"At MoMA PS1, you walk into a gallery empty save for people. One person is sitting immobile and apart, like a sulking child. Another is pretending to be a machine, mouth noises and all.

Technology,Amazon's Latest Way Into Your Life Is Through the Front Door,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/technology/amazon-key-home.html,"SEATTLE -- For many online shoppers, packages often linger for distressingly long hours outside their homes, where they can be stolen or soaked by rain. Now, if customers give it permission, Amazon's couriers will unlock the front doors and drop packages inside when no one is home.

What could possibly go wrong?

The head spins with the opportunities for mischief in letting a stranger into an empty home. There are risks for couriers too -- whether it's an attacking dog or an escaping cat. To allay these concerns, Amazon is asking customers to trust it -- buy a package of technology including an internet-connected smart lock and an indoor security camera.

Amazon isn't the only business that believes this is the future of internet shopping, as well as other services that require home access, like dog walking and house keeping. This summer, a start-up that makes smart locks, Latch, struck a deal with Jet.com, an online shopping site owned by Walmart, to jointly pay for the installation of its locks on 1,000 apartment buildings in New York City to make deliveries easier. The arrangement offers some of the security of a doorman for people who live in buildings without them.

E-commerce companies have experimented with ways of making deliveries more secure for years. Amazon installs self-service lockers in office buildings and outside supermarkets where customers can fetch their orders, and Daimler and other carmakers have tested the delivery of goods from Amazon and other retailers to customers' car trunks.","With permission, Amazon's couriers in many cities will unlock homes and drop packages inside.

Theater,"Review: At the Big Apple Circus, Discs Fly and So Do People",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/theater/big-apple-circus-review-.html,"The weather is a misery, the subways are a disaster, the news is unspeakable. But inside a tent tucked into a rear corner of Lincoln Center Plaza, a poodle is tooling around in a miniature sports car, his sequined scarf fluttering. Which is to say that the Big Apple Circus is in town and a little more joy is loosed upon the city. This year's show, again written and directed by Mark Lonergan, is high flying, but also more low key. The marquee acts are fewer and gone is Barry Lubin, a beloved clown I'd always found hinky and unfunny, fired from the circus for sexual misconduct. He's been replaced by Adam Kuchler, a nifty juggler dressed like a Jazz Age swell. Mr. Kuchler has a sidekick, Mark Gindick, disguised as a phone-glued weekend dad who wanders into the ring by mistake. Together they groove to the cheerful live music. (The choreography is by Grady McLeod Bowman.)

The show kicks off with Emil Faltyny balancing on the free-standing ladder, an act that requires astounding discipline, but isn't much to look at, until he adds a soccer ball, improvising a lulu of a penalty kick. By contrast, Victor Moiseev's horizontal juggling is visually ravishing -- balls shaped like giant cranberries besiege him on all sides -- but unastounding. ""It looks like he's doing magic, but really he's not,"" my 5-year-old, cotton-candy-drunk date said sagely. Valeriy Sychev and Ekaterina Abakarova perform a steamy aerial straps act, a soaring sex ballet in which Mr. Sychev enfolds Ms. Abakarova and lifts her toward acrophilic bliss before grounding and then ghosting her. It included some dazzling holds, as when Ms. Abakarova keeps herself aloft through thigh strength alone. A rousingly egalitarian doubles act comes courtesy of Virginia Tuells and Ihosvanys Perez, a married couple who perform as Duo Fusion. Do they know this is also the name of an antacid? Their acrobatic balance begins typically, but after a few moves, Ms. Tuells takes a turn as the anchor, supporting Mr. Perez. She bends into a bridge and he does a handstand atop her abdomen (is that the antacid tie-in?) and good lord is it wonderful. I kept nudging the 5-year-old in a see-girls-really-can-do-it-all way; she never imagined they couldn't and took the wonders in stride.

An act called Spicy Circus bounds atop twinned trampolines, and I took no notes as the Flying Tunizianis flung themselves toward their trapezes because it turns out I can't write while I'm gaping. This year's routine involved two catchers and, during the finale, a spangled foursome seems to square dance midair. The Flying Tunizianis perform with a safety net, which may nettle some thrill seekers, but I've always found the alternative too stressful.

For absolute gladness, there is no topping Jenny Vidbel's animal acts. The use of animals in circuses is controversial, but Ms. Vidbel, who works only with domestic animals, lives with them year-round and continues to care for them in their retirement, makes it seem a friendly and virtuous thing. (Her costumes all have treats pockets.) The stallions are grand; the miniature horses cuddly; the potbellied pig deserves a string of kiss-blowing emojis the width of this page. To see her dogs catch flying discs -- which yes, most dogs do, but these dogs do it better and in time with the band -- is to be on barking terms with delight. ""You have to write down that this part is good,"" my date demanded. These may sound like damning words, but -- with the bustier and aerial straps maybe excepted -- the Big Apple Circus is wholesome family entertainment. It is good-hearted and pleasure-minded. The acts don't overstay their welcome (honestly, that pig could have stayed forever) and the cast is robustly international. In the finale, everyone returns to the ring, shimmying together like a spangled, more flexible United Nations. I left happy and even though she's a tough customer and I'd confiscated her cotton candy, my date did, too. The circus ran away with us.","The Big Apple Circus returns with oversize airborne cranberries, a steamy aerial ballet and a prancing pig.",bf11abf2-8d7c-5c06-ab32-d871f2fa23cc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/19/arts/19bigapple2/19bigapple2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=ea973499f187efd60f6d03719a68631caed8e501cf8007cdc5f8e36ce4355bf4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Virginia Tuells and Ihosvanys Perez, a married couple who perform as Duo Fusion, at the Big Apple Circus at Lincoln Center in Manhattan.",bf11abf2-8d7c-5c06-ab32-d871f2fa23cc,N24News/imgs/bf11abf2-8d7c-5c06-ab32-d871f2fa23cc.jpg,10
Television,Why One Woman Testified Against Bill Cosby: 'I Had the Strength',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/arts/television/bill-cosby-lublin-accuser.html,"For many years Lise-Lotte Lublin thought of Bill Cosby as a fatherly figure, as much of the country did, though for her it was personal: He had been a mentor and friend who had once even referred to her as a daughter. But three and a half years ago, she heard the former model Janice Dickinson's account of having been drugged and assaulted by Mr. Cosby in 1982. The story had disturbing similarities with a strange episode Ms. Lublin recalled from 1989. Slowly she came to the sickening conclusion that Mr. Cosby had drugged her and, she believes, sexually assaulted her, too. The realization launched Ms. Lublin, a schoolteacher in Las Vegas, on an extraordinary trajectory. By December 2014, she had joined the growing chorus of women who publicly counted themselves as Mr. Cosby's victims. In 2015, she and her husband led a successful fight to change Nevada's statute of limitations for sexual assault.

Then this month, she appeared in a Pennsylvania courtroom. Sitting on her hands because they were shaking so much, she became one of the few among Mr. Cosby's dozens of accusers to face him again, helping secure his felony convictions on Thursday for sexually assaulting a former Temple University employee. ""I realized I had the strength to look in the face of somebody who would commit a crime like this,"" Ms. Lublin, 51, said in a phone interview from her Las Vegas home. ""I knew I was strong enough to say, 'You won't whip me, you won't hold me down, and you won't shut me up.' "" That the jury convicted Mr. Cosby on retrial, after a hung jury last summer, might be attributed in part to the new cultural awareness born out of the #MeToo movement. But in his remarks after the verdict, the Montgomery County district attorney, Kevin R. Steele, praised the witnesses for their courage, saying they were crucial to the case. He also called each of them separately to convey his gratitude and, choking up, told Ms. Lublin that because she and the other witnesses had stepped up, they were able to win the case. In 1989, Ms. Lublin was 23, living in Las Vegas, her hometown, and modeling to help pay for college when she was summoned by her agency to meet Mr. Cosby. Guessing he had seen her portfolio pictures, she went.

On their second meeting, she said, he invited her to his suite at the Las Vegas Hilton, because he wanted her to practice improvising, even though she wasn't an actor. He gave her alcohol to relax, she said, and soon afterward she felt woozy and sick, like she might topple. Mr. Cosby beckoned her over, she said, pulled her down between his legs, so that her back was against his groin, and began stroking her hair. Ms. Lublin remembers wondering why he was doing that, and that she couldn't understand a word he was saying. She has a few fractured memories of being guided by him down a hallway of the suite, and then nothing, until she woke up at home in her bed. Ms. Lublin was mortified, but not, at the time, because of anything Mr. Cosby might have done. ""I looked at it as 'Oh my god, Lisa, you got sick from alcohol; you don't even remember how you got home,'"" she said. When Mr. Cosby reached out to her again, and even forged a friendship with her mother, she felt reassured: Maybe her blackout behavior hadn't been that bad. Ms. Lublin said she and Mr. Cosby met several times after that -- though never alone -- and that at his urging, she began running at a track as he looked on. When bystanders asked what Mr. Cosby was doing there, Ms. Lublin said he replied, ""I'm out here with my daughter, Lisa."" (Lisa is the name she goes by.) Eventually they fell out of touch. After Ms. Dickinson went public with her story late in 2014, Ms. Lublin began reconsidering what really happened at the hotel that night.

Ms. Lublin felt like she had been punched, but then rebounded. ""I'm a fighter,"" she said. In 2015, she successfully urged Nevada legislators to extend the statute of limitations for bringing forward rape charges to 20 years from four years, though the change does not apply retroactively. Ms. Lublin said she never hid what was going on from her children, a daughter who is now 11 and a son, now 13, or from her sixth-grade students, who sometimes came up after class, asking if it was her they had seen on TV. ""Yes,"" she said she replied, ""And I'm working to change laws to protect you."" When vicious online comments about her -- detractors called her a ""liar"" and a ""whore"" -- inevitably surfaced, one student wrote back, ""Ms. Lublin's my teacher, and she's a wonderful person.""

In 2017, as prosecutors were preparing to try Mr. Cosby on charges of sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, the former Temple employee, detectives contacted Ms. Lublin and told her she might be called as testify as a ""prior bad acts"" witness who could help prove a pattern of criminal behavior by Mr. Cosby. ""One of the reasons the district attorneys picked Lisa was when they heard her talking about him petting her hair,"" her husband, Benjamin Lublin, said. ""That was a marker for them."" She wasn't called for Mr. Cosby's first trial. Then, in mid-March, just before the Lublins left for a spring break cruise to Mexico, the confirmation came. Ms. Lublin was going to be one of five women called to bolster Ms. Constand's testimony. The district attorney's office flew her and her husband to Philadelphia on a red-eye flight April 9. A few days later, a detective picked them up from their hotel and drove them to the courthouse. They were deposited in a witness room, where they played with Turks, the russet Labrador therapy dog the prosecutors had brought in to soothe people's nerves. To further loosen things up, Mr. Lublin set up his Bluetooth speakers, began playing his favorite country singer, Jon Pardi, and pulled out a favorite card game, Sequence. Early in the afternoon, a court officer came and escorted Ms. Lublin, her husband by her side, to a courtroom door near the jury box. Ms. Dickinson, who had just testified, emerged from the door. The pair embraced, and then Ms. Lublin stepped in.

Ms. Lublin had girded herself for a grilling, but compared with Ms. Bliss's questioning of Ms. Dickinson, whom she would later call a ""failed starlet,"" Ms. Lublin said her own cross-examination felt almost toothless. She said Ms. Bliss pressed for inconsistencies in Ms. Lublin's old statements about changing Nevada's statues and about meeting with Ms. Allred. Ms. Lublin found herself bickering with Ms. Bliss, getting snippy and worn down, but she never wavered. ""The story doesn't change when you tell the truth,"" she said in the interview last week. Ms. Lublin was back in her classroom of 25 sixth graders on Thursday when her husband called with news of the verdict. Hours later, at home, she still found herself stunned, and pacing. ""At some point,"" she said, ""I just gotta let myself feel.""","Lise-Lotte Lublin was one of several women who spoke in court about their experiences with Mr. Cosby, helping prosecutors convict him of sexual assault.",12950e30-f736-5f38-8cfc-b7f69edcd144,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/29/arts/29cosby-accuser1/29cosby-accuser1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=3620d872014fa3028631beed4e06aa015fca5a6144bb8c96c814915673b34381&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Lise-Lotte Lublin at home in Las Vegas on Thursday.

Your Money,"From Honus to Derek, Memorabilia Is More Than Signed Bats",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/16/your-money/from-honus-to-derek-baseball-memorabilia-is-more-than-signed-bats.html,"THE best birthday present I ever received came from my wife. She gave me a baseball from the 2009 World Series signed by Derek Jeter, the New York Yankees shortstop. I treasure it because he's my favorite player but also because my newborn daughter slept in my arms while I watched the Yankees win that World Series. Like many Yankees' fans, I spent last Saturday watching the coverage of Jeter getting his 3,000th hit over and over. And then, I thought of all the memorabilia that was coming -- all the balls, bats, jerseys, photos and anything you could imagine signed by Jeter. Three days later, I actually saw some of that memorabilia in the making, at the headquarters of Steiner Sports in New Rochelle, N.Y. The Steiner warehouse looked like a cross between a Home Depot and Santa's workshop, with shelves stacked to the ceiling with sports merchandise. I saw a half-dozen men framing photographs Jeter had signed Sunday night. There were boxes of balls he had also signed, stacked like crates of oranges. Blown-up Sports Illustrated covers of Jeter were in the back, out of the way for the time being. I had gone to Steiner Sports to see more than just the Jeter memorabilia, though. I also wanted to understand the broader market for baseball collectibles. What types of things appreciate? Can a collector expect to profit from his hobby? Most important, how do you know if what you have is valuable or just an expensive tchotchke? Here is some of what I learned: STRIKEOUTS Chances are pretty good that the sports memorabilia most people have is not worth much. All the balls, bats and pictures being sold at retail stores and online to commemorate Jeter's milestone fit into that category.

Brandon Steiner, who in 1987 founded Steiner Sports, which is now owned by Omnicom, said there were different levels of collectors, ranging from those who save programs and tickets to people who buy things that were used in a game. In between is the market for so-called authentic collectibles. A day after his 3,000th hit, Jeter signed 500 balls and 400 photos for Mr. Steiner's company. Those balls are selling for $699.99; the photos range from $599.99 to $799.99. Mr. Steiner said this was a relatively small signing to meet the immediate demand. He has scheduled two more for Jeter to autograph game-used memorabilia as well as things fans send in and pay a fee to have autographed. And that's just for one moment in baseball history, awesome though it was. Retired baseball greats and not-so-greats have been signing memorabilia, for a fee, for 30 years at baseball card shows, flooding the autograph market. The worst offender may be Pete Rose, who holds the record for the most hits ever, 4,256. Since he was caught betting on baseball and banned from the sport, he has been a prolific signer. Balls inscribed ""I'm sorry I bet on baseball -- Pete Rose"" are being sold on Walmart.com for $189.99 and on Amazon.com for $159.95. (A ball with just his name costs $69.99.)

This segment of the memorabilia industry is an easy target for purists. ""I have total disdain for the manufactured memorabilia market,"" said Richard Simon, a baseball autograph dealer and authenticator. ""That is what is going on right now, as opposed to Babe Ruth signing an autograph book or a photo of himself 70 years ago."" But Mr. Steiner is unapologetic. ""The last three or four years, I've been thinking, how do we get to the average fan who can't afford authentic, let alone game-used?"" he said. He cited ballpark dirt and the bricks from the old Yankee Stadium as affordable keepsakes. ""People laugh at me about the dirt, but I've sold over $10 million worth of dirt."" Howie Schwartz, chief executive of GrandStandSports.com and a competitor to Steiner, said the relative affordability of Jeter memorabilia -- ranging from $400 to $1,000 -- matches up well with the huge market for him. ""Look at how many people watch baseball and how many kids play baseball,"" he said. The average consumer may think 900 items is a lot. But there were 50,000 fans at Yankees Stadium that day."" Still, while 50,000 people buying identical signed baseballs may be good for the seller, it is not good for anyone who expects the collectible to increase, or even hold, its value. HOME RUNS The market for high-end sports memorabilia is different. The most famous baseball collectible of all time is a baseball card known as the T206. It depicts Honus Wagner, a Hall of Fame shortstop from the early 20th century, and there are only about 60 still around. (Wagner ordered the maker, the American Tobacco Company, to stop production, legend has it, because he was not paid enough for his image or feared that children would buy cigarettes to get it.) The T206 once owned by the hockey legend Wayne Gretzky was sold in 2007 for $2.8 million to Ken Kendrick, owner of the Arizona Diamondbacks. At the other end of the scale is the baseball Mark McGwire hit for his record-setting 70th home run in 1998. Todd McFarlane, a Hollywood producer and toymaker, bought it in 1999 for $3 million. Mr. McGwire has since admitted steroid use, and Roger Ponn, president of Roger Ponn Associated Appraisers, said he would be surprised if Mr. McFarlane could get six figures for it now.

Mr. Ponn's advice to avoid getting caught with a lemon is morbid but practical. ""Dead sports stars' event-used memorabilia will rarely go down in value,"" he said. Scarcity is also a key. Jerry Zuckerman, president of Tary Enterprises, a dealer in Oradell, N.J., said he sold a New York Yankees jersey that Lou Gehrig wore for away games for $363,000 in 1992. Today, he said, it was worth $750,000. A similar jersey worn by Babe Ruth would be worth slightly less, he said, because there are many more of them. ""It's an up and down market depending on the economy,"" Mr. Zuckerman said. ""But if you buy quality, that tends to fluctuate less. Game-worn uniforms of exceptional Hall of Famers will always be a valuable item."" The worst investments come from athletes who played from the 1970s to the present. Many became fixtures at card-collecting conventions and have devalued their signature by signing too many things. ""Sometimes a promoter will have a sports star sign, say, jerseys in a limited edition of 300, but then another couple months later, the sports star will sign another 300 in a limited edition,"" Mr. Ponn said. ""The market for it is nil."" But for those collectors with something unique, there are other questions. There will only be one 3,000th hit ball from Derek Jeter. And it, like all one-of-a-kind items, needs to be insured. But just as important for collectors is how they care for what they have. ""A faded signature is not a covered loss,"" said Robert Courtemanche, president of ACE Private Risk Services. ""That's a wear and tear thing. We cover it from an unexpected act -- flood, fire, theft.""","The Yankee shortstop gets his 3,000th hit and the memorabilia machine goes into action, churning out bats, balls, jerseys and more. But not all signed batting helmets are created equal.",c4969a6d-9cad-542d-bb1b-87beb771abf0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/07/16/your-money/16wealth/16wealth-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=344&w=600&s=06632fafe44972daa687f4705d00a18566e139743f85fd65c46573821c94b5c3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Brandon Steiner, head of Steiner Collectibles, with a box of Derek Jeter-signed baseballs in the company warehouse.",c4969a6d-9cad-542d-bb1b-87beb771abf0,N24News/imgs/c4969a6d-9cad-542d-bb1b-87beb771abf0.jpg,21
Technology,AT&T Chief Says It Made a 'Big Mistake' Hiring Michael Cohen,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/11/technology/att-cohen-trump-time-warner.html,"WASHINGTON -- Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T's chief executive, said on Friday that the company had made a ""big mistake"" by hiring President Trump's personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to provide advice on federal policy, including how the government might approach the telecommunications giant's deal to buy Time Warner. Mr. Stephenson also said that the company's head of lobbying and external affairs, Bob Quinn, would be leaving the company. ""Our company has been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons these last few days and our reputation has been damaged,"" Mr. Stephenson wrote in a memo to employees. ""There is no other way to say it -- AT&T hiring Michael Cohen as a political consultant was a big mistake."" Mr. Stephenson's note followed the revelation this week that the company had paid Mr. Cohen $600,000 to advise on the $85.4 billion merger with Time Warner and other regulatory matters.

Federal prosecutors are investigating Mr. Cohen's business dealings, including a $130,000 payment he made to the adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, known professionally as Stormy Daniels, to buy her silence about an affair she says she had with Mr. Trump. The president has denied Ms. Clifford's claims. The payment to Ms. Clifford was the first known activity involving Essential Consultants, a company started by Mr. Cohen. It was through Essential Consultants that AT&T retained Mr. Cohen. Several other businesses, including the Swiss drugmaker Novartis and an American company linked to a Russian oligarch, also sent payments to Mr. Cohen's company. The Russian, Viktor Vekselberg, was stopped and questioned at an airport this year by investigators for Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel examining Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Although AT&T's statements were meant to distance itself from Mr. Cohen and the arrangement on Friday, they also provided insight into how companies like AT&T operate in Washington during the Trump era. Mr. Trump pledged during his campaign to shake up the Washington establishment -- to ""drain the swamp"" -- while railing against ""the special interests, the lobbyists and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday Americans."" He also announced policies intended to clamp down on the revolving door between government and K Street, which is home to many of the capital's lobbying firms.

But the anti-lobbying rhetoric and policies did not discourage some former Trump aides from seeking big paydays from the influence industry, where few of the established players had close connections to Mr. Trump or his inner circle. Some Trump insiders, including Mr. Cohen and Corey Lewandowski, a former Trump campaign manager, positioned themselves as strategic advisers. Because they were offering insight -- or political intelligence -- on Mr. Trump and his team, and not overtly lobbying, they did not need to disclose their role with Congress and possibly the Justice Department. AT&T fanned out to try to keep pace in this changing climate. Although the company has long retained a platoon of lobbyists with deep connections on both sides of the aisle, none of the firms they worked with were as close to Mr. Trump as Mr. Cohen. The company said Mr. Cohen had approached it about being a consultant, and that he was among ""several consultants"" the company hired as Mr. Trump was assuming the presidency. AT&T officials would not disclose the names of the other people and firms hired. But according to a person with ties to Mr. Trump's campaign, AT&T approached other Trump associates about possibly retaining them as government affairs consultants or lobbyists. The person would speak only under the condition of anonymity because the talks were private. Among Trump associates pitching AT&T was Mr. Lewandowski. AT&T said it was approached early in January 2017 by Avenue Strategies, a lobbying firm that Mr. Lewandowski helped found. AT&T said it did not pursue a contract with the firm, which Mr. Lewandowski left in the middle of 2017. AT&T paid a total of $4.1 million in lobbying fees to nearly 30 firms through the first three months of this year, according to congressional lobbying filings. But none of those businesses, including top-tier law firms like Mayer Brown and Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, have lobbyists who were as close to Mr. Trump as Mr. Cohen.

Novartis said its former chief executive, Joe Jimenez, hired Essential Consultants. Like Mr. Stephenson, Novartis's current chief executive, Vasant Narasimhan, has distanced himself from Mr. Cohen, saying this week that he had no role in the decision to hire Mr. Cohen. The company has also said that hiring Mr. Cohen was a mistake. Novartis said it discovered soon after signing the contract that Mr. Cohen could not provide the services he had promised and allowed the contract to expire. Columbus Nova, the investment firm in New York whose biggest client is a company controlled by Mr. Vekselberg, the Russian oligarch questioned by Mr. Mueller, paid about $500,000 to Essential Consultants last year. A lawyer for Columbus Nova has described the money as a consulting fee that had nothing to do with Mr. Vekselberg. Earlier this week, AT&T said that it had been contacted late last year about Mr. Cohen by Mr. Mueller's team. AT&T said it had ""cooperated fully"" with the inquiries.

Novartis said this week that it had also spoken with special counsel's team about the payments to Mr. Cohen. Novartis said that it had cooperated fully and considered its role in the matter closed. For AT&T, the disclosure of its ties to Mr. Cohen comes at a critical moment. The company is defending its merger with Time Warner in federal court against the Justice Department's efforts to block the deal. It is unclear what services Mr. Cohen provided. Mr. Stephenson insisted in his memo that ""everything we did was done according to the law and entirely legitimate"" and that Mr. Cohen did not do any lobbying on behalf of AT&T. Nonetheless, Mr. Stephenson added, retaining Mr. Cohen ""was a serious misjudgment."" Time Warner was not aware of AT&T's contract with Mr. Cohen, according to a person familiar with the company's thinking. Within Time Warner this week, officials were surprised to learn about the contract with Essential Consultants. Mr. Cohen did not respond to an interview request. Many large corporations consider such strategic advice to be part of their government affairs program, complementing their overt lobbying efforts. AT&T's contract with Mr. Cohen, for instance, called for him to advise the company on ""corporate tax reform and the acquisition,"" according to documents first obtained by The Washington Post. But Mr. Stephenson said that with Mr. Cohen, ""our Washington, D.C., team's vetting process clearly failed, and I take responsibility for that."" Mr. Stephenson said that Mr. Quinn, 57, who had led the Washington team, had decided to retire. But according to a person familiar with AT&T's thinking, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the decision, he was pressured to leave because of the revelations of AT&T's contract with Mr. Cohen.","In a companywide memo, Randall Stephenson also said the company's head of lobbying would retire.",c261ff02-ff12-52ec-bdaa-0645e58f83fc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/12/business/12att-print/12ATT-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=5d728e50a51a6c53980e24893a70014d1639fa398a57e04330fcd7c76e954901&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Randall L.

Fashion & Style,Jil Sander Gets New Creative Directors; Emilio Pucci Loses One,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/fashion/jil-sander-emilio-pucci-creative-directors-luke-lucie-meier-massimo-giorgetti.html,"Another week, another round of designer musical chairs in the creative studios of top-tier European luxury houses. On Thursday, Emilio Pucci announced the abrupt departure of Massimo Giorgetti, and Friday brought the appointment of the husband-and-wife team Luke and Lucie Meier as joint creative directors at Jil Sander. Pucci, owned by the luxury giant LVMH, said that after four seasons as creative director, Mr. Giorgetti would be leaving the company, effective immediately. Mr. Giorgetti, a maverick Italian designer and former D.J. who succeeded Peter Dundas at Pucci in March 2015, initially made his name in the industry with the contemporary label MSGM, which specializes in quirky digital graphic prints and bold colorful shapes. His efforts, perhaps too avant-garde for the average Pucci consumer, received a lukewarm response from retailers and the media alike. In her review of the fall 2017 collection, Vanessa Friedman of The New York Times called the show ""a look-at-me heave,"" adding that the clothes were ""a queasy-making mix of highlighter green and orange, hot pink and brown in a disco/loungewear fiesta that included, inexplicably, hats with fringe completely obscuring the face and hanging down to the waist in the front.""

Less than six weeks later, Mr. Giorgetti has departed to once again focus his efforts on MSGM. He called his tenure at Pucci ""an inspiring journey, which has also contributed to my professional growth"" and ""a beautiful adventure."" In a statement, he thanked LVMH; Laudomia Pucci, the daughter of the founder; and Mauro Grimaldi, the chief executive of the company. ""We have decided by mutual agreement to end the partnership,"" Mr. Grimaldi said in a statement. ""I would like to thank Massimo for the great professionalism shown during these last two years of collaboration."" On Friday morning, a long-circling rumor was confirmed when Luke and Lucie Meier were named creative directors at Jil Sander, replacing Rodolfo Paglialunga, who left the company last month. Ms. Meier, together with Serge Ruffieux (now the creative director of Carven), led the ready-to-wear and couture studios at Dior under the leadership of Raf Simons, taking over the creative reins after his exit and the arrival of Maria Grazia Chiuri. Previously, Ms. Meier had worked for Marc Jacobs, then the creative director of Louis Vuitton, and Nicolas Ghesquiere, then the creative director of Balenciaga. Mr. Meier is a former creative director at the cult streetwear brand Supreme and a founder, in 2015, of the modern urban men's wear label OAMC. The Meiers' first collection for Jil Sander will be shown in September in Milan.

""We feel proud and honored to join this beautiful brand,"" the couple said in a joint statement after the announcement. ""We hope to show the affection we have for this brand through our work, as Jil Sander has had such a profound influence on our paths."" Alessandra Bettari, the chief executive of the brand, said that she expected ""the creation of very clever collections"" and that the Meiers had ""a vision which is modern, cohesive, and in touch with what is relevant now."" Jil Sander, known for its minimalist codes, has undergone enormous creative flux in recent years, with Ms. Sander leaving and returning to the company three times before finally stepping down for good in 2013, to be followed by Mr. Paglialunga. The Meiers, relative unknowns, are part of a recent trend among high-profile fashion houses to opt for lower-profile designers instead of starry names.

Media,Los Angeles Times Newsroom Voting on Whether to Unionize,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/business/media/los-angeles-times-union-vote.html,"Newsroom employees at The Los Angeles Times began casting ballots Thursday on whether to form a union, in what they believe is the first time journalists have held a union vote in the newspaper's 136-year history. Workers -- who are calling for more competitive salaries, equitable pay for women and minorities, more generous benefits and improved working conditions -- began voting at 10 a.m. in a first-floor community room at The Times headquarters in downtown Los Angeles and at the company's offices in Orange County. Those who work remotely or who are on assignment will be able to vote using mail-in ballots. A tally of the vote is expected to be announced on Jan. 19; forming a union requires a simple majority of votes cast. The unit would include roughly 380 employees. People familiar with the process said they believed the organizing effort had the votes to join the NewsGuild, which represents 25,000 reporters, editors, photojournalists and other media workers at news organizations across the United States.

The union vote affirms something of a shift at The Times, where a bombing by union organizers in 1910 helped shape a historically anti-union stance. The organizing effort has also exacerbated tensions between newsroom employees and the newspaper's executives. Times employees, who have seen repeated management and ownership turmoil over the years, have long expressed skepticism over their top leaders, but a wave of recent changes further strained their relationship. Over the last several months, Tronc, the Times's Chicago-based corporate parent, installed a new publisher, Ross Levinsohn, and editor in chief, Lewis D'Vorkin, who has vowed a ""digital transformation"" that has left some in the newsroom anxious. A dispute between The Times and the Walt Disney Company also raised tensions between the paper's employees and its new top management, with some employees questioning how Mr. D'Vorkin had handled the paper's response.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Management typically counters efforts to organize employees, but many in The Times newsroom -- especially against the backdrop of already tense relations -- said they felt that those in charge have been unduly aggressive in the attempt to thwart the union effort. ""You can't just try on a union and easily get rid of it later if it doesn't live up to the promises,"" Mr. D'Vorkin and Jim Kirk, another top editor, said in an email to employees on Wednesday in advance of the vote. ""The question to you is do you want to preserve your independence and the independence of the Los Angeles Times or do you want someone else negotiating on your behalf?""

During a staff meeting in November, after learning that a recording of an earlier meeting had been leaked to a reporter from The New York Times, Mr. D'Vorkin said anyone involved with the act was ""morally bankrupt,"" according to several people in attendance. ""Our recent change of newsroom leadership provided our managers a brief opportunity to restore some trust. They chose not to try,"" Doug Smith, a senior writer who has worked at The Times for nearly 50 years, wrote in a post in support of the union. ""For the first time in my nearly five decades at The Times, I, along with my colleagues, have been publicly scolded by my publisher and by my editor."" In an emailed statement, a Tronc spokeswoman said, ""The Company urges every individual in the LA Times newsroom to get out and vote. We believe that by working together, rather than through a third party, we can build on the LA Times heritage and trust with readers. We remain committed to providing a productive and safe working environment for all employees, and will continue to act with the best interest of all of our employees in mind."" As newsroom employees prepared for the election, the union organizing committee has tried to combat Tronc's anti-union push by reporting on The Times and the compensation and perks its leaders receive. In November, it published a report on its website about Tronc executives, including Michael W. Ferro Jr., the company's chairman. The report detailed what the committee described as ""outsize compensation"" for company executives, as well as Mr. Ferro's use of a private jet that Tronc had paid to sublease from Merrick Ventures -- a company led by Mr. Ferro. On Dec. 22, the Friday before Christmas, Tronc disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had agreed to pay Merrick Ventures $5 million annually on a rolling, three-year basis ""to provide certain management expertise and technical services."" The news -- even as some employees say they have not received raises in years -- rankled many in the newsroom and helped bolster the unionization effort. Tronc had been pushing for the election to be held in mid-December, before it disclosed the agreement, according to two people familiar with the process. (The company said the contract was a replacement for the private arrangement of the aircraft sublease.) Workers at many of the country's prominent news publications, including The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, are represented by unions. There has also been a recent push for organization at digital news outlets; employees at several such companies, including HuffPost and Vice Media, are now union members.","The newspaper's Chicago-based owner, Tronc, has pushed back aggressively against the effort. The vote tally will be announced later in the month.",0db583a3-4abf-5b6a-bc75-e556e086b20f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/05/business/05LATIMES/05LATIMES1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=881ff7b280b90b0020efd01cd26831b65ec68f2371e32c8592301b24d1a480f8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Newsroom employees at The Los Angeles Times voted Thursday on whether to join the NewsGuild union, which would represent roughly 380 employees.",0db583a3-4abf-5b6a-bc75-e556e086b20f,N24News/imgs/0db583a3-4abf-5b6a-bc75-e556e086b20f.jpg,16
Technology,'TikTok Grandma' Who Helped Tank Trump Rally Now Works for Biden,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/technology/tiktok-grandma-trump-biden.html,"Last weekend, Mary Jo Laupp was enjoying a quiet night at a birthday party for her granddaughter -- until she picked up her phone and her world flipped upside down. A TikTok video she had made urging people to reserve tickets to President Trump's June 20 rally in Tulsa, Okla. -- and then not show up -- had gone viral. Rally attendance had turned out to be far lower than billed by the Trump campaign, and TikTok teens and Korean pop music fans were taking a victory lap online. Ms. Laupp's phone was blowing up with calls, messages and notifications. Now Ms. Laupp, 51, who has become known as ""TikTok Grandma,"" has been recruited by the Biden Digital Coalition, a grass-roots organization, to put her TikTok skills to work supporting the presidential campaign of Joseph R. Biden Jr. The coalition, made up of about 100 people -- many of whom are alumni of other Democratic presidential campaigns -- works to amplify pro-Biden messages and build engagement on social media. While it is not part of Mr. Biden's campaign, it is in contact with Biden staff members. Coalition members, who are all volunteers, said they brought on Ms. Laupp for her ability to turn a viral moment into a call to action.

""Cleary, something she had done had worked out really well, so we wanted to harness that energy,"" said Caitlin Gilbert, a coalition co-director. Ms. Laupp, who works in the music department at her local high school in Fort Dodge, Iowa, said she was delighted to join the Biden group. ""The offer was completely unexpected, but I'm excited to be a part of a team that is embracing social media technology as a campaign tool,"" she said on Friday. She said her first task was to help build a ""political hype house"" for Mr. Biden, which is essentially a group of content creators on TikTok who will make pro-Biden videos and explore the viability of campaign organizing on the app. ""My platform has kind of become this bizarre gathering place for people who want to try to make change,"" Ms. Laupp said. Young people are ""absolutely energized and ready to go.""

Ms. Laupp, who has four children and six grandchildren, is an unlikely TikTok star. The entertainment app, which is owned by the Chinese tech company ByteDance, is known for its audience of teens and even younger viewers and for making celebrities of 16-year-olds. Ms. Laupp, who is married to a minister, first started using the app in May. Raised in a Christian household in Michigan and a graduate of the conservative Cornerstone University, Ms. Laupp said she had become more liberal over time. In the 2016 presidential election, she voted for the Libertarian Party nominee, Gary Johnson. This year, she volunteered for Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., in the Iowa caucuses. ""When asked to name the greatest commandment, Jesus mentioned two -- love God with everything you have, and love everyone else,"" Ms. Laupp said. ""As it stands right now, one party does a far better job in showing love, compassion and empathy than the other."" Denise Aptekar, who also worked on the Buttigieg campaign, said Ms. Laupp was responsible for getting young people at her high school engaged with it. ""She called herself a most unusual Pete supporter given the conservative social circles she grew up in,"" Ms. Aptekar said. The inspiration for the viral TikTok video came from a friend, Ms. Laupp said. For years, the friend had staged solo protests against political candidates she disliked by registering for their rallies under a fake name and not showing up.

Ms. Laupp wondered what would happen if masses of people did the same for the Trump rally in Tulsa. So she made a video urging viewers who ""want to see this 19,000-seat auditorium barely filled or completely empty go reserve tickets now, and leave him standing there alone on the stage"" -- and was ""overwhelmed"" by the response.","Mary Jo Laupp, who made a viral TikTok video that disrupted a Trump campaign event, plans to create a ""political hype house"" to support Joe Biden.",1e72759f-c07c-569a-a216-765ffdc51f5d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/26/business/26tiktokgrandma1-copy/26tiktokgrandma1-copy-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=1e1930bb210a3344192dfe5d949ecaee4b13e14fdf61578e3225df3f359a1ae9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mary Jo Laupp, whose TikTok video urging people to reserve seats but not show up at a Trump rally went viral.",1e72759f-c07c-569a-a216-765ffdc51f5d,N24News/imgs/1e72759f-c07c-569a-a216-765ffdc51f5d.jpg,20
Music,"Jack Sheldon, Trumpeter and 'Schoolhouse Rock!' Singer, Is Dead at 88",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/arts/music/jack-sheldon-dead.html,"Jack Sheldon was the vocalist on songs like ""I'm Just a Bill"" from the animated television series ""Schoolhouse Rock!"" But he was also a prominent jazz trumpeter.





Jack Sheldon, an accomplished jazz trumpeter who also had a successful parallel career as an actor -- but whose most widely heard work may have been as a vocalist on the animated television series ""Schoolhouse Rock!"" -- died on Dec. 27. He was 88. His death was announced by his manager and partner, Dianne Jimenez. She did not say where he died or specify the cause. Jazz fans know Mr. Sheldon as a mainstay of the once-thriving West Coast scene and as a sideman with Stan Kenton, Benny Goodman and other bandleaders, as well as the leader of his own ensembles. Lovers of obscure TV shows might remember him as the star of the sitcom ""Run, Buddy, Run,"" the story of an innocent bystander who finds himself being pursued by gangsters, which lasted all of 13 episodes in the 1966-67 season.

He was also for many years a member of the band led by Mort Lindsey on ""The Merv Griffin Show,"" one of Johnny Carson's more durable late-night competitors. In addition to being featured as a trumpet soloist, Mr. Sheldon honed his comic chops in goofy exchanges and vocal duets with Mr. Griffin. (His humor sometimes toyed with television's taste standards. Mr. Griffin once asked him if he had finished high school; he responded by rolling up a sleeve, pointing to his arm and saying, ""I had the highest marks in my class."")

Beryl Cyril Sheldon Jr. was born on Nov. 30, 1931, in Jacksonville, Fla., and was playing trumpet professionally by his early teens. He briefly attended the University of Southern California and Los Angeles City College and, after two years in the Air Force, where he played in a military band, settled in Los Angeles in 1952. He was soon working and recording regularly, with his own groups and with the saxophonists Art Pepper and Dexter Gordon, among many others. He toured Europe with Benny Goodman's band in 1959 and continued to work with Goodman on and off for more than 20 years.

""There actually weren't so many of us at the time,"" Mr. Sheldon told JazzTimes magazine in 2011, recalling a West Coast contingent of young modernists that also included his friend and fellow trumpeter Chet Baker. ""Now there are a million jazz guys out there, and they all play great. But what we were doing back then, back in the '50s -- that was different. We knew we were doing something special."" Known for his warm, rich trumpet sound, Mr. Sheldon was also a busy studio musician, accompanying singers like Frank Sinatra and Peggy Lee and playing on the soundtrack of numerous movies. He was a favorite of soundtrack composers like Johnny Mandel -- who featured him on ""The Shadow of Your Smile,"" from the 1965 movie ""The Sandpiper"" -- and Henry Mancini. ""It's a haunting trumpet he plays,"" Merv Griffin told The Los Angeles Times in 2002. ""Henry Mancini once told me, 'If I've got a couple making passionate love onscreen and I'm writing the score, it's Jack Sheldon's trumpet I want.'"" Mr. Sheldon led an onscreen big band in the 1991 movie ""For the Boys,"" starring Bette Midler and James Caan as performers entertaining the troops through several wars, and kept the band together afterward for nightclub engagements. He also led a small group, the California Cool Quartet.

But he had more than trumpet playing in his portfolio. As a singer, he charmed audiences with an appealingly laconic, conversational style. His offbeat between-songs patter -- inspired, he once said, by the nights he spent on bills with Lenny Bruce and Mort Sahl -- led to occasional work as a stand-up comic and acting opportunities on TV comedy shows including ""The Cara Williams Show"" (1964-65), on which he played a jazz musician, and ""Run, Buddy, Run,"" his first and only starring vehicle, as well as his long-running role as Mr. Griffin's foil.

When the jazz pianist, singer and songwriter Bob Dorough was hired in the 1970s to provide music for what became ""Schoolhouse Rock!,"" Mr. Sheldon was one of the vocalists he used. He breezily sang about the use of words like ""and"" and ""but"" on ""Conjunction Junction,"" written by Mr. Dorough, and about how a bill becomes law on ""I'm Just a Bill,"" written by Dave Frishberg. Years later, he would sing parodies of those songs on episodes of ""The Simpsons"" and ""Family Guy.""",He played with leading jazz musicians. He bantered with Merv Griffin. But his best-known work may have been on a children's cartoon series.,1fa69b6e-ed5f-5455-8bea-4fff5e3b8750,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/04/obituaries/03Sheldon-obit2/03Sheldon-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=5dc38bea330e30f18b40bca9422550cf6d2415c2cb05f49c5b1bd5a710cfb21a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Jack Sheldon was the vocalist on songs like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Just a Bill&rdquo; from the animated television series &ldquo;Schoolhouse Rock!&rdquo; But he was also a prominent jazz trumpeter.,1fa69b6e-ed5f-5455-8bea-4fff5e3b8750,N24News/imgs/1fa69b6e-ed5f-5455-8bea-4fff5e3b8750.jpg,12
Music,Israeli Pianist Wins Thelonious Monk Contest,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/arts/music/thelonious-monk-competition-tom-oren.html,"""The Monk family requested that they would like to use the name in other directions, and we decided that we would abide by their wishes,"" Thomas R. Carter, the institute's president, said in an interview. ""All the programs that are currently in place will continue.""

The drummer T.S. Monk, the son of the institute's famed namesake, did not respond to an email requesting comment. He has been a ubiquitous presence at Monk competitions, but did not attend this year's event.

The Monk institute started the competition in 1987, and for its first three years it focused on rising pianists. Starting in 1990, it began to highlight a different instrument each year; it has since helped to catapult the careers of prominent young vocalists, saxophonists, trumpeters, drummers and more.

The institute had not held a gala since 2015. Mr. Carter attributed this to the institute's recent focus on International Jazz Day, an initiative it began in 2011, and the difficulty of arts fund-raising at a time when natural disasters have put an added burden on humanitarian philanthropy.

Mr. Oren, a native of Tel Aviv, is very much a product of jazz's educational establishment. He attended the Thelma Yellin High School of the Arts in Givatayim, Israel, and the Israel Conservatory of Music in Tel Aviv, as well as the Rimon School of Jazz and Contemporary Music in Ramat HaSharon and the Arison Campus of the Arts in Tel Aviv. He came to the United States in 2012 to attend Berklee College of Music in Boston on a four-year scholarship.","Tom Oren, 24, won the prestigious Monk competition, in its last year under this name.

Media,Ad Boycott of Facebook Keeps Growing,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/business/media/facebook-ad-boycott.html,"Facebook put on an upbeat presentation to advertisers on Tuesday, the same day the clothing chain Eddie Bauer, the film distributor Magnolia Pictures and the Ben & Jerry's ice cream brand announced that they would stop advertising on the platform through July. Those companies joined Patagonia, the North Face, REI and others in a growing boycott that has targeted Facebook's content moderation practices. In a short video, part of a weeklong showcase for digital companies hoping to attract advertising dollars, Facebook displayed posts that companies like Delta Air Lines and Calvin Klein ran during the coronavirus pandemic. The prerecorded presentation did not specifically address the boycott. While several large companies have pulled away from Facebook, smaller businesses that make up the bulk of its eight million advertisers have been considering their options.

Jason Dille, who oversees media planning for 20 clients at the ad agency Chemistry, said many of them had considered putting a halt to buying ads on Facebook but that the pandemic had complicated their plans. ""Some of my clients are just starting to come back,"" Mr. Dille said. ""If they don't create sales and get business to turn around, they're going to go under."" He added: ""Facebook is a double-edged sword. You don't want to support it, but you have to use it in order to reach a large audience."" The backlash intensified late last month, as a flurry of misinformation appeared on Facebook amid worldwide protests against racism and police brutality. The company declined to take action against posts from President Trump -- the same ones that Twitter flagged as misleading or glorifying violence. In recent days, Facebook removed ads from Mr. Trump's re-election campaign that featured a red triangular symbol used by the Nazis during World War II. The company also announced that it would gradually allow users to opt out of seeing political ads. On Sunday, it acknowledged in a blog post that its enforcement of content rules ""isn't perfect.""

""It feels like we've come to an inflection point,"" said Stephan Loerke, the chief executive of the World Federation of Advertisers, a trade group. ""There's a growing awareness that this isn't a brand safety issue anymore -- it's a societal safety issue."" Facebook executives have tried to limit the damage. In an email sent to some of its largest advertising clients last week, obtained by The New York Times, the company said it had taken steps to mitigate the effects of potentially harmful speech on the site. ""There are competing pressures every day when managing a platform,"" the memo said. ""Our focus is to act on what is most important: removing hate speech and content that harms communities while using our platform for efforts like providing authoritative voting information and registering people to vote."" Carolyn Everson, Facebook's vice president for global marketing solutions, said in a statement that the company was in discussions with advertisers and civil rights groups ""about how, together, we can be a force for good."" ""We deeply respect any brand's decision, and remain focused on the important work of removing hate speech and providing critical voting information,"" she said in the statement. Most companies that have turned away from Facebook are not shutting down their Facebook accounts. They expect to return to buying ads on the platform after July. ""It almost feels a little hypocritical to me,"" said Barry Lowenthal, the chief executive of the Media Kitchen agency. ""How do you justify going back?""","Eddie Bauer, Magnolia Pictures, Ben & Jerry's and others have suspended campaigns over the platform's content moderation practices.",6def7642-e1a1-52db-a48e-7e2388c3606a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/23/business/23facebook-ads/23facebook-ads-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=d7231e7ed3c2bf0c4be619727183f15369d5a5fa2e165b5007ab28fa1f845d5b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Facebook, which held a presentation on Tuesday to pitch itself to advertisers, is losing some prominent ones because of its policies.",6def7642-e1a1-52db-a48e-7e2388c3606a,N24News/imgs/6def7642-e1a1-52db-a48e-7e2388c3606a.jpg,16
Dance,"On 125th Street, Dancing Toward Freedom",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/arts/dance/national-black-theater-125th-and-freedom.html,"Every Saturday in June, Ebony Noelle Golden's ""125th and Freedom"" is making its way from the East River to the Hudson River along 125th Street in Harlem.





The dancers had been walking for nearly six hours when, around 6:30 p.m. on a recent Saturday, they reached the Hudson River and rejoiced. Stepping in buoyant unison to the beat of a New Orleans-style brass band, they pumped their hands toward the sky and toward the ground, as if saluting the land, air and water that greeted the end of their journey. They had made it through ""125th and Freedom,"" a marathon of a performance piece by Ebony Noelle Golden that stretches from the East River to the Hudson River in Harlem, inviting anyone in its path to join the procession. The 16 performers -- and the rapt audience they had picked up along the way -- had fulfilled, at least symbolically, the promise of one of their songs, repeated along the last leg of 125th Street: ""We're going to the mecca, the sea, the ocean.""

Stopping at sites including the Harriet Tubman Memorial and the former Lenox Lounge -- now a Wells Fargo -- the 16-part ritual tells the story of a tribe fighting for its freedom with the help of Libra, a time-traveling descendant of Tubman who flies in from the future. As it progresses, the work grows more interactive; at Amsterdam Avenue, for instance, audience members write their hopes on slips of fabric and attach them to a sprawling ""dream net."" Ms. Golden, who is from Houston, began the project about five years ago as part of Dancing While Black, an initiative founded by the artist Paloma McGregor. Initially envisioned as a concert dance piece, it evolved along with Ms. Golden's struggle to stay in Harlem in the face of rising rents . In an interview at National Black Theater's headquarters near 125th Street, she recalled asking herself: ""What does it mean to feel free in my own body, and to feel free in my home?"" The inaugural project of NBT Beyond Walls, a program that brings National Black Theater out of its longtime residence as it prepares for a major expansion, ""125th and Freedom"" echoes the work of the company's founder, Barbara Ann Teer. Her early ensemble, the Liberators, often performed in the street, combining poetry, music and dance -- Ms. Teer began her career as a modern dancer -- much like Ms. Golden does today. ""We hadn't really revisited that Liberator energy since the '70s and early '80s,"" said Sade Lythcott, Ms. Teer's daughter and National Black Theater's chief executive. ""So we decided to end our 50th season with a piece that honored this tradition.""

You've gone through a lot to stay in Harlem. People say, ""Just move somewhere else, move to Jersey or the Bronx,"" and I have tried that. But it's not just a desire to live in Harlem; it is absolutely necessary, and I'm talking from a spiritual perspective, a political perspective, an academic and scholarly perspective. It is actually a part of my resistance, to find a way to be in the home, the mecca, of the black arts. When we sing that at the end of the show, we're talking about Harlem -- about protected, sacred black space. Why did you decide on a site-specific approach? I thought: If I'm going to build this love poem to Harlem, and to places that are dealing with this rapid change, I need to be in public. This is a political choice for me as an artist, because I see the concert stage as a safe space -- a curated, manicured space. You get in, do the thing, get out. There's a whole other set of circumstances when you take a rather polarizing conversation to the street and ask these questions in earshot of people who may agree or disagree. All of it can be rather volatile.

So people come up and ask what you're doing? People have been doing that the whole time. I've been building this piece for four years; 125th Street has been my studio. When we first started, people would literally be like, ""Get out of the way,"" and we kept coming back. We kept listening and engaging people to the point where now they know we're coming.

In the finale -- a reprise of the first scene -- are you drawing from particular movement traditions? I'm looking a lot at the Second Line dance that comes out of New Orleans, at carnival dance that's diasporic, at Caribbean dance styles. And my own training in terms of West African dance is coming through. What do you see as the role of dance in this piece? It's the cornerstone. I'm a multidisciplinary artist that must work through my body. I need to tell the story through movement first, and then the words will come. Before we had all of the choreography set, there were gestures that kept reappearing. They were approximations of what we saw in pictures of Harriet Tubman: how she stood, the iconic image of her reaching forward and reaching back. Every image we saw, we hydrated in a way, so that it wasn't static anymore. One of my biggest choreographic influences is Jawole Willa Jo Zollar. Her work, my understanding of her work, is about a muscular detail, a muscular nuance: the way the body is asked to explore and deepen and find. Most of the time we've been making this piece, that's been the experiment. It hasn't been ""do these steps.""

Art & Design,A Living Room Fit for a King,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/01/arts/design/a-living-room-fit-for-a-king.html,"Bronson van Wyck is one of those van Wycks -- perhaps you've driven on their Expressway.

It shouldn't be too much of a surprise that Mr. van Wyck, a 44-year-old event planner, has a strong sense of history, given that he is descended from one of the New York region's Dutch founding families.

For starters, it's pronounced ""van WIKE,"" he said this week, smiling but firm on the topic, seated in his spacious apartment adjacent to Madison Square Park.

Then he added: ""That's how we say it. But what do we know, at this point?""

Mr. van Wyck grew up in Arkansas, went to Yale and did stints handling protocol for the State Department and designing movie sets in Los Angeles. He founded his firm, Van Wyck & Van Wyck, with his mother, Mary Lynn.

He said its signature events had included Madonna's 57th birthday in Bridgehampton, N.Y., and ""eight parties in nine days"" for the opening of the new Whitney Museum of American Art, both in 2015. Currently, Mr. van Wyck is working on a book about entertaining, and his Instagram profile reads, in part: ""Born to party. Forced to work.""","Bronson van Wyck, descended from one of the New York area's Dutch founding families, enjoys decorating his home as he usually designs temporary spaces.",5ed3ca52-8eea-5f4a-a4f1-499c16f94670,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/02/arts/02SHOWUSYOURWALL/02SHOWUSYOURWALL-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=b036a762cedae67efc34c1a99e47fe07bbc947498aff34c59384d04c5be6db25&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Bronson van Wyck, a 44-year-old event planner who is descended from one of the New York region's Dutch founding families, in front of an 11-foot-tall map, once used to chart the appointments and engagements of George VI and Queen Elizabeth.

Music,'We Can't Do Our Craft': Conductors Contend With the Pandemic,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/26/arts/music/classical-music-conductors-coronavirus.html,"On March 12, Roderick Cox, an American conductor based in Berlin, was just days away from his New York Philharmonic debut when he woke up to a message from the orchestra asking him to get on the next possible plane out of Germany. The United States was closing its borders to Europe because of the coronavirus pandemic, and Mr. Cox scrambled to leave that day. But while he was still in the air, he got the news that Carnegie Hall was canceling performances until April. So was the Metropolitan Opera. And the Philharmonic. ""It was like the stock market was crashing,"" Mr. Cox recalled in an interview. Once he got to his hotel in New York, he found himself asking a question rare for conductors, whose schedules are typically planned years in advance: What now? As the pandemic ravages the classical music industry, with performances at a standstill in the United States and Britain, and only slowly returning in Europe and parts of Asia, conductors are in an unfamiliar position. Typically front and center, many of them have been invisible as artists resort to solo livestreams. Spending time alone studying scores has always been part of their work, but without orchestras, they can go no further.

Some conductors never really stopped. Alan Gilbert, the Philharmonic's former music director, is now based in Sweden and said that, because of that country's strategy in managing the virus, ""I was one of the busiest conductors in the past several months, by no way of bragging."" Like other artists who have been able to work, he has done so with a twinge of guilt, fully aware of the precariousness facing his colleagues worldwide. And those who remain away from the podium, especially conductors with posts at orchestras, recognize that they worry about the industry from a position of privilege. Overall compensation for Jaap van Zweden, the Philharmonic's current music director, has been reduced by 56 percent, according to the orchestra. But that's from a total of at least $1.6 million a year. So for conductors with steady work before the pandemic -- globe-trotting and rarely home -- the aftermath of cancellations has amounted to a surprise sabbatical. They have learned new languages, picked up old instruments, and composed. And they have begun to reimagine performances for the coming year.

Mr. van Zweden is with his family in the Netherlands and has been working to expand the number of facilities his Papageno Foundation runs for autistic children and young adults. He has also taken up composing -- ""just to expose what I am going through as a human being."" John Eliot Gardiner, who had been touring a Beethoven symphony cycle this year that has been repurposed as a video series on YouTube, retreated to the British farm where he has lived since the late 1960s. He has been at work on a book about Monteverdi, based on a podcast project due out this year. ""I'm lucky,"" he said. ""And I hope I will produce something that's worthy of the privilege of having this time.""

""But like most people,"" she said, ""I ticked those things off within the first few weeks."" Now she has Russian lessons every day; other colleagues have also taken the opportunity to learn a new language in earnest. Most studying, however, is reserved for scores. With room to breathe before a planned performance of Beethoven's ""Missa Solemnis"" next year, Ms. Young has gone beyond the music to research the work in relation to the writing of Thomas Mann and Theodor Adorno. Miguel Harth-Bedoya, in his final season with the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra, which is planning a brief return for an online concert on Independence Day, said that he had been exploring the works of Bohuslav Martinu for the first time. Mr. Rouvali is doing the same with Schumann and Mahler. And although Mr. Gaffigan's summer run of Wagner's ""Tristan und Isolde"" with Santa Fe Opera was canceled, he is still studying it because, he said, ""there are certain pieces of literature that are worth reading even if you're not doing a thesis on them."" Erstwhile instrumentalists have revisited old etudes. Susanna Malkki -- who was to conduct Kaija Saariaho's new opera, ""Innocence,"" at the Aix Festival in France and is there now for small-scale rehearsals in anticipation of its future premiere -- said that practicing her cello had been ""like coming home."" Alondra de la Parra has taken up the piano again, and said that playing with no specific goal ""has already made me a much better musician over all.""

Ms. Alsop, who teaches at the Peabody Institute at Johns Hopkins University, has been working with the school to develop virtual reality tools for podium-deprived conducting students. Others with directorships have been planning for what concert life will look like as it returns in phases. In Louisville, Ky., Teddy Abrams of the Louisville Orchestra said that he had spent his time away from the concert hall rethinking the fall as a series of public service events, adding, ""A lot of what we're talking about is less in the form of concerts and more in the form of projects."" Orchestras in Europe have been less drastic in their approaches, working on a smaller scale rather than reimagining the concert experience. Klaus Makela, the Finnish conductor who was recently appointed music director of the Orchestre de Paris, said that he was reconsidering some repertoire for his coming season, adding with a laugh that Messiaen's grand ""Turangalila-Symphonie"" will ""obviously have to change."" Performances that have begun to go forward may be more humble. But for conductors who have been away from the stage, they have been overwhelming. Mr. Gaffigan, a New Yorker now in Norway, said that when his long break ended with a rehearsal of Schubert's Fifth Symphony in Stavanger, he couldn't wipe a smile off his face. ""It was this basic thing that I took for granted my whole life,"" he said. ""The sound of someone playing in a room with me, and being able to react to and mold that sound -- it's such a privilege. Live performance is so special.""","With most orchestral concerts canceled, conductors have been largely invisible.",26d14530-0d50-563f-8530-6c45059fb4c1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/26/arts/26CONDUCTORS-1/26CONDUCTORS-1-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=0b592dff614df6c9ae0a56c23a04eb0b12d0a9d53c7421c728dbf0494c30de1c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Clockwise, from top left: John Eliot Gardiner, Susanna Malkki, Roderick Cox and Marin Alsop are among the conductors whose performance calendars were derailed by the coronavirus pandemic.",26d14530-0d50-563f-8530-6c45059fb4c1,N24News/imgs/26d14530-0d50-563f-8530-6c45059fb4c1.jpg,12
Your Money,"Avoiding Yardsticks, Bond Funds Excel",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/your-money/bond-funds-excel-by-avoiding-indexes.html,"BOND funds are on track for their best year since 2009, and the secret to many managers' recent success has been simple: just don't mimic the indexes. The average taxable bond fund gained 6.8 percent through the first three quarters of the year, beating the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate bond index by nearly three percentage points. In all, three-fourths of actively managed bond funds outpaced the Barclays index in the third quarter and the first nine months of this year. And among intermediate-term bond funds that hold high-quality debt with similar average maturities to the benchmark, 89 percent of active managers outperformed in the third quarter. This is a big departure from 2011, when most bond managers trailed the Barclays Aggregate, which represents the broad domestic investment-grade debt market. The performance stands in stark contrast to the equity markets, where a majority of fund managers continue to lag behind the Standard & Poor's 500 index of blue-chip stocks.

Kathy A. Jones, fixed-income strategist for the Schwab Center for Financial Research, notes that a lot has to do with how bond indexes are built. She points out that there is a big difference between equity and fixed-income indexes. Because most stock benchmarks are weighted according to market capitalizations, the most successful companies with the largest stock market values have the most sway on indexes. By contrast, when bond indexes mirror the market for fixed-income securities, it means that the securities of the biggest debtors are the most represented. In the Barclays Aggregate, for instance, Treasuries, government agency debt and mortgage-backed securities account for roughly 80 percent of the index. ""Corporate bonds represent only about 20 percent,"" Ms. Jones said. ""The rest is pretty much tied to Treasury rates, and those are probably going to underperform in a market like this where Treasury rates are low and the Federal Reserve is intent on keeping them low."" Actively managed bond funds, on the other hand, are keeping more than 34 percent in corporate bonds, according to Morningstar. And with the Fed promising to keep rates low until at least 2015, ""balancing out a portfolio to be less Treasury-related in this environment could make a lot of sense,"" Ms. Jones said.

To be sure, there are times when a portfolio dominated by Treasuries can thrive, even in a low-rate world. When economic fears grip the market, as was the case during much of 2011, investors will often gravitate toward ultrasafe Treasury bonds, driving already low rates even lower while pushing up prices. But as worries about Europe's fiscal crisis have subsided a bit -- at least for now, with the European Central Bank pledging to buy financial assets to keep rates low and to prop up the region's economy -- there hasn't been the same ""flight to safety"" so far this year.

AS a result, intermediate-term government bond funds were up just 3 percent in the first nine months of this year while portfolios that invest mostly in corporate debt have surged more than 6.2 percent. ""If I have the ability to go anywhere, I have a better chance of finding something interesting,"" said Jason Brady, co-portfolio manager of the Thornburg Strategic Income fund, which beat 85 percent of its peers in the third quarter. Less than 1 percent of Mr. Brady's fund is currently invested in Treasury debt, but more than 65 percent is in corporate bonds. And nearly half of those bonds are in what's often called the ""crossover point"" -- rated either BBB, still considered investment grade, or BB, the highest-quality debt in the non-investment-grade universe. Christopher Vincent, co-manager of the William Blair Bond fund, which beat 77 percent of its peers in the quarter, also says he thinks there are promising opportunities at the low end of the high-quality market and the high end of the so-called junk market.

By prospectus, his fund can invest only 10 percent of its assets in high-yield debt. Right now the fund is ""near our max,"" he said. Mr. Vincent said his fund was not outperforming simply by focusing on credit quality. Its sector and regional bets have also been paying off. For instance, his fund is overweighting exposure to the debt of domestic financial services companies relative to the Barclays index. ""The financial sector has been shunned and undervalued, which has helped us a lot,"" he said. Among the fund's top holdings are bonds issued by the investment bank Morgan Stanley and the insurer American International Group. William Blair Bond has also been overweighting exposure to investment-grade or crossover debt issued by Latin American companies, such as Embraer, the Brazilian aerospace company. ROGER A. EARLY, co-chief investment officer for total return fixed-income strategy at Delaware Investments, notes that active bond managers have also been able to add value this year through basic security selection and risk analysis. For instance, Mr. Early said, his team had been lightening exposure to corporate bond issuers that depend heavily on Europe's struggling economy. As for China, the economic deceleration in that country has not ""caused us to turn on the panic switch yet,"" he said. But the firm's fixed-income portfolios that are allowed to invest in non-dollar-based debt have begun making some incremental moves. For instance, they have reduced their stake in Australian bonds because of concerns that China's slowdown could have an impact on the credit quality of Australian companies tied to commodity markets. ""We haven't taken that to the next step,"" he said, which might include pulling back exposure to markets with more direct ties to China.","Bond fund managers who concentrate on corporate issues have lately been able to beat the bond indexes, where government bonds can carry huge weight.",5a7cbc6d-1f73-50f2-9b46-0beb677b036a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/10/07/business/7-FUND2/7-FUND2-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=370&w=600&s=41894391a59a5389c3d22df67596f814cea63cc7e41a343a2b4886695ab3ad12&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Bond fund managers have found success by not mimicking the benchmark indexes.

Movies,'The Tomorrow Man' Review: Love Among the Neuroses,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/movies/the-tomorrow-man-review.html,"Sometimes you'd think there was a conspiracy among movie stylists to turn older female characters into a combination of sister-wife and refugee from a Laura Ashley sample sale. As Ronnie in the late-life romance ""The Tomorrow Man,"" the lovely Blythe Danner is their latest victim. Swathed in mismatched separates, shapeless woolens and schoolgirl ankle socks, Ronnie is supposed to look quirky; instead, she just looks like she doesn't own a full-length mirror.

Written and directed by Noble Jones, ""The Tomorrow Man"" is a cloying, at times disturbing tale of two dotty seniors whose eccentricities unexpectedly mesh. Ronnie's issues, though -- she's a timid hoarder who likes war documentaries -- are mild compared to the aggressively paranoid lens through which Ed (John Lithgow) views the world.

Real Estate,Power Lifting of a Residential Kind,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/realestate/jay-wright-gym-guru-for-high-end-condos.html,"Izak Senbahar, the president of the Alexico Group and co-developer of 56 Leonard, the undulating tower that redefined TriBeCa's skyline, didn't hesitate when it came time to select a fitness guru to assemble what, in his opinion, is the most pivotal amenity component of a luxury residential project: its fitness center. Mr. Senbahar turned to Jay Wright, the chief executive of the Wright Fit, a company specializing in functional performance training that has a staff of 76 and expects to double in size by the end of the year. It was formed in 2007, shortly after Mr. Wright made a splashy residential debut with a benchmark fitness center at the much-scrutinized 15 Central Park West. For that building, Mr. Wright proposed, and pulled off, a costly facility with the most inventive cable-based machinery available, all of it cardiocentric and all of it compatible with the space designed by Robert A. M. Stern Architects. ""What they got was the best residential gym, not just in New York City, but one of the best gyms anywhere,"" Mr. Wright said. ""When 15 CPW not only survived the recession, but thrived, other developers took notice of the recipe that went into it."" Mr. Wright leveraged his share of the recipe, and his instant renown, by signing up for similar high-end projects with a variety of developers, including Mr. Senbahar and his trophy tower, 56 Leonard, which will feature a fitness center installed and managed by Mr. Wright. ""Nobody else was doing what we were doing at that time,"" he said.

For luxury condo developers, adding a 15 CPW-caliber facility to the amenity package is a status symbol and selling point. ""We're like insurance,"" said Mr. Wright, who is currently in negotiations to design, install and operate a 60,000-square-foot space for a multibuilding project on the Upper West Side. Of course, Mr. Wright has plenty of competition. But he gave himself early traction in the fitness business by anticipating the amenity trend at luxury residential developments and by networking with developers. ""We interviewed five health club management companies,"" said William Lie Zeckendorf, a developer of 15 CPW, who had trained with Mr. Wright downtown at the Peak Performance gym on West 21st Street, ""and Jay made one of the finest presentations I've ever heard on fitness, where fitness is going, fitness facilities in private buildings, a higher level of service with more programs, just a brilliant presentation. So we hired him and he was a tremendous hit there, in my opinion.""

High-end fitness centers have become a mandatory amenity and, at $1,000 or more per square foot not including equipment, an expensive one. ""Modern-day torture chambers,"" suggested Mr. Senbahar with a laugh, ""and you need to have the best."" The Wright Fit design studio is in the Flatiron district at 900 Broadway. Mr. Wright, who majored in political science at the University of Tennessee and impetuously dropped his plans for law school in favor of an eight-year modeling stint, segued into fitness as a career path in 1998 at the now-defunct Duomo gym. He researched scientific literature on progressive fitness programs and gym equipment, and starting in 2004, refined his management and marketing skills while running Peak Performance, the 10,000-square-foot fitness emporium he co-owned before transitioning into luxury residential projects on a hunch that fitness and wellness facilities were the next must-have amenity. Whippet-toned with a raffish hipster hairdo, Mr. Wright, 46, is as passionate about promoting spiritual and nutritional health as sculpturing physiques. ""Spinning and cross-fit training may be fashionable, but I don't design to fads,"" he said. ""This industry is evolving toward training that focuses on functional longevity: It's a scary proposition to think of the wheels starting to come off the bus when you turn 60 or so. When I'm in my 60s, I still want to be able to snowboard with my kids."" He lives in a NoHo loft with his wife, Gia, a jewelry designer, their 4-year-old son, Tiber (their second child is due in March), and no gym equipment. He works out almost daily at Peak Performance and also skis, surfs, snowboards and plays tennis. ""I used to live in the gym when I was a teenager,"" said Mr. Wright, who hung out with the power lifters and strength coaches at the University of Tennessee, where his father was a professor of philosophy.

""I devoured Conan comic books at 10, had my hopes of playing football shut down by a knee injury, and was always fascinated by fitness. As a guy in the modeling business, you had to stay body conscious, because it seemed like every other casting agent told you to take your shirt off. I've never not been fit,"" he said with a shrug of his well-defined shoulders.

Mr. Wright's brand has been adopted by a who's who of seasoned developers: Zeckendorf Development and Global Holdings (15 Central Park West, 18 Gramercy Park, 50 United Nations Plaza), the Rudin Family (the Greenwich Lane), Harry Macklowe and CIM Group (432 Park Avenue), Michael Stern of JDS Development Group (Walker Tower and 626 First Avenue) and Steven C. Witkoff (150 Charles Street). He is overseeing the 17,000-square-foot fitness space at Jean Nouvel's chic MoMA tower at 53 West 53rd Street, and the Related Companies hired him for 15 Hudson Yards. ""The well-designed in-house fitness center has become the norm in the industry,"" said Eric Rudin, the president of Rudin Management. ""It's a great amenity that people love, there's a huge convenience factor, and it adds real value to a residential project. With Jay, he's so knowledgeable about installing the right equipment and having the right flow and overseeing it, that it's like one-stop shopping, so we gave him a blank slate,"" he said, referring to the Greenwich Lane, the elaborate development on the former St. Vincent's Hospital campus. Mr. Wright's vision for holistic fitness extends far beyond bulging biceps and is open to future experimentation: Why not, he reasons, combine the rigors of a Paleolithic menu with the ministrations of a top-flight sommelier? Why not enhance the fitness experience by adding a spa? ""You don't dare call it a gym anymore,"" said Mr. Senbahar, ""and you don't bury it in the basement. Jay is a superb strength and performance specialist with tremendous scientific knowledge. I mean, he practices all of this stuff himself. He told me he follows a cave man diet. I'm more evolved, strictly on a pizza diet. But seriously, when you see him and how fit he looks, he makes you want to exercise."" Mr. Wright furnished the gym at Mr. Senbahar's house in the Hamptons and advised Mr. Rudin on the best treadmill for his personal use, a $17,000 Woodway.",Jay Wright and his Wright Fit company are behind several high-end fitness centers in luxury residential projects.,5cad32e4-cf9d-5dfc-a09f-e66385adbf0a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/08/realestate/08DEBRIEF1/08DEBRIEF1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=59a483fbe48e3e7b92d7b41c806f81040c290f92a51ade3ea041d7b62a44c7bd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Jay Wright and his Wright Fit company are behind several high-end fitness centers in luxury residential projects.,5cad32e4-cf9d-5dfc-a09f-e66385adbf0a,N24News/imgs/5cad32e4-cf9d-5dfc-a09f-e66385adbf0a.jpg,7
Art & Design,Sydney Art Museum Receives Big Funding Boost,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/arts/design/sydney-art-museum-receives-big-funding-boost.html,"Although Sydney's state art museum is perennially popular -- it attracts about a million people a year -- it looks cramped and outdated in its current form. And in the last two decades it has lost ground -- in terms both of visitor numbers and quality of experience -- not only to Melbourne's National Gallery of Victoria but also to art museums in smaller cities like Brisbane and Canberra, which have benefited from their own expansions.

The gallery's director, Michael Brand, has had to fight opponents of the plan on multiple fronts.

Conservative voices from within Sydney's art world have questioned the need for any upgrade. A former prime minister -- once known as a great champion of the arts -- has publicly lambasted the project. Private donors have appeared reluctant to come on board. And the state government, which is ultimately responsible for funding the museum, had been unable to commit for years.

A windfall created by the privatization of the state's electricity infrastructure changed the financial equation. But even as the government established a culture and arts fund of 600 million Australian dollars (about $452 million), it came under pressure to steer money away from so-called ""elite"" arts institutions and toward less-established organizations in the outer suburbs and regions.

To make the grant promised for the Sydney Modern project more palatable, the government announced a new Regional Cultural Fund of 100 million Australian dollars (about $75.4 million). Officials hope, meanwhile, that Sydney Modern will double attendance and bring an additional $1 billion into the economy over 25 years.","The Art Gallery of New South Wales, a laggard on the Australian museum scene, is promised a hefty grant for a major expansion project.",f452d396-68b1-5174-9c07-c599f4d13829,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/14/arts/15SYDNEY/15SYDNEY-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=44b644fd347ec131c136991951a38ce6e031c3a9b7ceb85aaa8f101b40bdd1eb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""Kesh Alphabet,"" an installation by Emily Floyd in the foyer of the Art Gallery of New South Wales.",f452d396-68b1-5174-9c07-c599f4d13829,N24News/imgs/f452d396-68b1-5174-9c07-c599f4d13829.jpg,14
Real Estate,High Marks for Transit Hubs,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/realestate/new-jersey-in-the-region-high-marks-for-transit-hubs.html,"WANT to know which New Jersey train stations have the most plentiful supply of parking spaces relative to town population? There's a list for that. Or what about stations in the areas with the greatest number of jobs? There's a list for that. Or transportation hubs with the densest populations? There's a list for that as well. In fact, there are dozens of lists, charts and graphs that analyze land use, infrastructure, populations and living conditions surrounding all 243 transit stations in New Jersey. The extensive inventory is the result of a three-year study by NJ Future looking to stratify census data from neighborhoods near the state's transit hubs with an eye toward directing potential development in those areas. The timing of the study -- which maps income, car ownership, employment, housing, commuter activity, downtown amenities and more -- is propitious, given the many indicators that the population will continue to consolidate in urban and commuter town centers. ""It's funny; the timing is working out so well,"" said B. Timothy Evans, the research director at NJ Future, a nonprofit research organization that focuses on smart growth. After three years spent ""putting this thing together,"" he added, it is a stroke of luck that ""the interest is exactly in this sector.""

The interest he cited is being evinced first and foremost by home shoppers. Real estate sales are consistently strongest in towns along New Jersey's main commuter corridors; the economic downturn has not altered that. The latest survey on home prices conducted by the Otteau Valuation Group found that towns along the rail lines with New York City commutes of less than 50 minutes saw real estate values increase by 3.6 percent from 2010 to 2011, as compared with rural New Jersey, the weakest sector, which saw an 8.7 percent drop in home values. The future, too, looks bright for the commuter corridor, according to another Otteau survey, which found that building permits in rail towns reached 49 percent of the total permits issued from 2009 to 2010, having grown from 24 percent in the 1990s. Developers seeking to capitalize on this interest in transit hubs have for the last several years seen their enthusiasm and ambitious plans well rewarded by the state. Public financing for transit-oriented developments, once largely directed at municipalities, is today going directly to developers, in the form of tax credits. New Jersey's Transit Hub Tax Credit Program has provided nearly $1 billion in tax credits over the last three years to developers and business owners who have initiated sizable projects in nine cities deemed ""distressed"" and in need of investment. Bestowed by the state's Economic Development Authority, the tax credits are available to companies investing more than $50 million in projects within half a mile of one of the designated cities' transit stations, and generating more than 250 full-time jobs. Commercial enterprises can receive up to 100 percent tax credit on their capital investment, paid out over 10 years, while residential projects can receive up to 35 percent tax credit on the investment, up from the former cap of 20 percent.

The program has facilitated projects like Teachers Village in Newark, Campbell's Soup's new headquarters in Camden and New Brunswick's Gateway mixed-use development, said Timothy Lizura, a senior vice president of the development authority. ""Developers have many options on where to put their resources,"" he said. ""Sometimes you have to provide the incentive."" The program is capped at $1.5 billion and concludes in January. Another popular state program, called the Transit Village Initiative, supported two dozen municipalities seeking to rebuild neighborhoods around their transit stations. It lost its financing last summer, a victim of Gov. Christopher J. Christie's line-item veto. Joe Dee, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Transportation, which administers the program, said the governor's decision had been made in response to a very tight budget. ""It wasn't in any way a reflection of what the administration thought of transit villages and the benefits associated with them,"" Mr. Dee said. ""It was one of the tough choices that had to be made."" He added that his department had been encouraging current or future transit-village participants to seek funding through the state's municipal aid program. The Transit Village Initiative, which began in 1999, has designated 24 communities throughout the state for planning and financial assistance in revitalizing areas around their transit facilities to create mixed-use neighborhoods, with an emphasis on residential development. To take one example, Somerville became a transit village in 2010, receiving a $100,000 grant to upgrade sidewalks in a redevelopment zone near the train station. With the Transit Village program losing its funding for the current fiscal year, Somerville will not be looking there for the $600,000 it needs to create an arts district between the train station and the Main Street retail center. But Mayor Brian Gallagher isn't worried. ""We're going to sniff it out somewhere else and we'll get it,"" he said. ""We've had great success with this in the past, and we expect to in the future."" As the transportation hub of Somerset County, Somerville has had success in attracting public and private support to its downtown redevelopment efforts. In the first phase of an $80 million development, a new Shop Rite store opened in the center of town last fall; remediation is ongoing at a 130-acre former landfill beside the train station that will eventually be home to as many as 1,100 housing units, and more than 100,000 square feet of retail and commercial space. New Jersey Transit, which owns 35 of the 130 acres, jump-started the redevelopment effort by spending $15.3 million on a new station. ""Money goes where an investment will earn a return,"" Mayor Gallagher said. ""Regardless of whether it's the public sector or the private sector. And we're the recipients of both.""",Real estate sales are consistently strongest in towns along New Jersey's main commuter corridors.,f1b1df2a-c344-5588-b172-e514ae840a6b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/03/25/realestate/25NJZONE_SPAN/25NJZONE_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=330&w=600&s=b163ec77bb02497cce7714dac42d5be2bb2bf6dd6b3fbd1a3fd8cfa4813b5a0c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Housing and commercial space are planned for a site behind the Somerville train station.

Opinion,The Failure of Europe's Feeble Muscle Flexing,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/opinion/europe-iran-nuclear-deal.html,"BERLIN -- If you don't happen to be a foreign policy wonk, you've probably never heard of Instex, the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges. The company, set up by Germany, France and Britain in January 2019, was supposed to enable trade between Europe and Iran in defiance of United States sanctions. Now, a year later, the first transaction is just about to be processed, according to the German Foreign Office. All this may sound technical, and, well, wonky. I can already see you wondering: Should I really make the effort to keep reading this column? But it really is worth taking a closer look at Instex and its foibles. Because this instrument -- weedy and wonky though it may be -- is a prime example of the futility of Europe's struggle for strategic autonomy from the United States. If anybody in Berlin needed a reminder of how dangerously impotent Europe is in the face of President Trump's erratic foreign policy, Jan. 3 should have done the trick. On that day, the Iranian general Qassim Suleimani was assassinated by an American drone strike in Iraq; the fallout pushed the United States and Iran to the brink of war, and once again reduced European leaders to pleading for caution from the sidelines of world politics. Ever since Mr. Trump withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in May 2018, European countries have struggled to come up with an appropriate response. The J.C.P.O.A. -- also known as the Iran nuclear deal -- is an agreement between Iran, the United States, France, Germany, Britain, China, Russia and the European Union. When it signed the deal in 2015, Iran agreed to halt the development of nuclear weapons in return for the end of economic sanctions. Mr. Trump quit the deal three years later, despite reassurances by the International Atomic Energy Agency that Iran did comply with its terms. Soon afterward, the United States reinstated and extended American sanctions on Iran, including so-called secondary sanctions -- sanctions that not only prohibit American companies and citizens from trading with Iran, but also affect foreign entities and individuals who do so.

The withdrawal was a major shift in American policy. Instead of the deal's carrots-and-sticks approach -- an approach made in close partnership with Europe -- the Trump administration switched to a ""maximum pressure"" strategy, designed to choke Iran economically. The secondary sanctions also made clear that from the American perspective, Europe was on the wrong side of history and needed to be treated as part of the problem. To the European signatories of the deal, this shift posed a major strategic problem. Since Mr. Trump announced the American withdrawal, Iran has progressively ramped up its nuclear program; the E.U., including Germany, has pledged to uphold its commitment to trading with Iran in order to retain some leverage over the country. But Europe has had a hard time living up to this promise. The enormous impact of America's secondary sanctions comes not just from the market power of the United States, but also from the power of the dollar and America's capacity to legally or factually control financial transaction systems. ""On some level, almost every company has some sort of connection with the U.S."", said David Jalilvand, a foreign policy expert who runs Orient Matters, a Berlin-based political and economic consultancy specializing in the Middle East. ""Even if a company doesn't operate on the U.S. market, either its bank does, or one of its insurance companies or one of the reinsurance companies backing their insurance companies."" As a consequence, even companies that do not operate on the American market are affected. One key, then, to Europe obtaining ""strategic autonomy"" in international relations, is obtaining a capacity for independent financial transactions. Which brings us back to Instex. Instex -- stay with me here! -- is part of a barter system that is intended to avoid payments being exchanged directly between European and Iranian companies when they do business with one another, in order to avoid setting off American sanctions. Under this barter system, money doesn't have to ""cross"" the invisible line between Europe and Iran: Instex and its Iranian counterpart record the value of shipments from Europe to Iran, and vice versa, and organize the exchange of the appropriate amount of funds among exporters and importers on the same side of the line.

Sound complicated? It is. And while it works on paper, it's proved extremely hard to realize in the real world. Policymakers in Berlin admit freely today under the condition of anonymity that they had underestimated the technical difficulties. Instex was first announced by the European Union's high representative for foreign affairs in September 2018. It was first intended to be set up as an E.U.-institution; then, as a result of legal and political concerns, it transformed into a private company created by only three member states -- France, Britain and Germany -- to be hosted in Paris and headed by a German. But finding the right personnel to staff Instex proved difficult. The staff had to be composed of people with expertise in both diplomacy and banking, and people willing to take a personal risk, since the United States had threatened to bar both the company and anyone associated with it from the American financial system -- which could even extend to having private bank accounts shut down. After a lengthy slog, in January 2019, the three countries announced that Instex had come into existence. At a meeting of the E.U.'s foreign ministers in Bucharest, Romania, that month, the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, even tried, boldly, to flex some muscle: ""We're making clear that we didn't just talk about keeping the nuclear deal with Iran alive, but now we're creating a possibility to conduct business transactions,"" he said. A year later, with Instex poised to process its first transaction, Europe's great moment of defying the United States approach to Iran seems to have finally arrived. When compared to Mr. Maas's strong rhetoric in Bucharest, the sound emanating from German foreign policy circles today is rather mealy-mouthed. The first transaction is said to be a ""test case."" German officials have declined to name the exact amount, but say it is ""less than a million"" euros. They like to stress that everything about it is entirely legal and in accordance with the American sanctions regime: The first trade deal operated through Instex is a shipment of medical goods produced by a German company. Still, the exporting company's name has been treated like a state secret -- as are the names of the banks involved, for fear they might become the targets of American wrath. Also, there have been no Iranian imports to the E.U. in return, as laid out in the original concept of the barter system. The amount due for the shipment has been provided by Instex itself. Get through all that? Here's the tl;dr version: Under constant American diplomatic pressure and threats, Instex has gone from being promoted as the linchpin of an independent European foreign policy to a company sending less than a million euros' worth of humanitarian aid to Iran in half-secrecy. The once-defiant posture -- Europe proudly standing up to a bully -- is long gone. This was roughly the situation when Mr. Trump ordered a death sentence for Mr. Suleimani in January, causing the world, and not least Europeans, to hold their breath for several weeks in fear of a hot war in the Middle East. On the surface, the crisis did not influence Europe's strategy of management and control. France, Britain and Germany have triggered the nuclear deal's dispute resolution mechanism; Germany hopes to intensify regional dialogue, leveraging mounting concerns with Donald Trump's maximum-pressure strategy.

But while on the surface, Europe seems to press on with business as usual, the tectonic plates of trans-Atlantic relations are shifting. For Europe, a direct neighbor of the Middle East, the stakes of Mr. Trump's risky Iran strategy are extremely high; in January, Europeans learned that the American president would put the Continent's security interests at risk without batting an eye. This, as well as the bitter lessons learned from the Instex experiment, illustrate once again how hard it is to run an independent foreign policy in a dollar world in which the United States is weaponizing trade. European policymakers have been left with both a sense of urgency and a feeling of utter impotence. Not a comfortable pairing. At present, it looks like German foreign policymakers are willing to live with it, for lack of better options and for fear of retaliation if they step out of line. They are sustained by a vague hope that Iran's nuclear program can be contained until the American presidential election. If Donald Trump is re-elected on Nov. 3, however, a tipping point may be reached: The danger of sticking with the United States will outweigh the danger of letting go. Alternate partners have already offered themselves: Both China and Russia have long worked on diminishing their dependency on the dollar and on financial transaction channels dominated by the United States. They have followed Europe's Instex initiative with great interest, offering to join in. So far, Germany has declined the offer.",A novel financial instrument was supposed to bring Europe strategic autonomy from the United States. Its muted debut only shows how far-off that goal really is.,58e04416-4e7c-5492-bbc1-791cc81016c3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/10/opinion/10Sauerbrey/10Sauerbrey-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=ebda408aa9236ca5421adea0e88f48d79ecc5cc00c5b17fdced144bfaf3a0187&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Iranian flag in front of the International Atomic Energy Agency headquarters in Vienna.,58e04416-4e7c-5492-bbc1-791cc81016c3,N24News/imgs/58e04416-4e7c-5492-bbc1-791cc81016c3.jpg,11
Music,Rafiq Bhatia Is Writing His Own Musical Language,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/arts/music/rafiq-bhatia-breaking-english-son-lux.html,"The inspirations for Rafiq Bhatia's new album, ""Breaking English,"" include but are not limited to: Jimi Hendrix concert videos, blaring prayer calls from Turkish mosques, East African archaeological sites, the death of Trayvon Martin and Flying Lotus sound collages. They might sound scattered on paper, but they coalesce in the hands of Mr. Bhatia, a guitarist who refuses to be pinned to one genre, culture or instrument. This 30-year-old musician fluidly moves between jazz and rock groups, Indian and American musical influences, and acoustic and electronic sounds. His transient approach, combined with his obsession of assiduously studying the past in order to break cleanly from it, makes him one of the most intriguing figures in music today.

""I went through a lot of periods of very intense self-doubt about whether somebody like me could deal with this way of making music,"" Mr. Bhatia said in an interview at a Vietnamese cafe in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Growing up in a Muslim family in Raleigh, N.C., made him accustomed to being perceived as an outsider. ""There was a very large percentage of the population down there that were not comfortable with our presence,"" he said. And when he recently started wading into the world of electronic music and sound design after spending years in jazz communities, he said he felt ostracized: ""A lot of these spaces are dominated by white men or are very heavily segregated.""

For inspiration, he leaned into his identity and immersed himself in his family's labyrinthine, peripatetic history. His relatives trace back to India but spent several generations in East Africa; his maternal grandfather owned a restaurant in Tanzania, where he played violin for his patrons. That legacy manifests on ""Breaking English"" in the Carnatic violin playing of Anjna Swaminathan, whose lithe melodic gestures fit snugly with Mr. Bhatia's hypnotic, Radiohead-like guitar patterns. And two songs named ""Olduvai"" refer to the Tanzanian gorge that Mr. Bhatia visited with his family about a decade ago, where some of the earliest human fossils were discovered. While Mr. Bhatia embraced his cultural past, he rejected his musical one. An intimidatingly strong guitar player from an early age, he studied first at New York University and then at Oberlin, where he was taken under the wing of the estimable drummer Billy Hart. In subsequent collaborations with Vijay Iyer, Marcus Gilmore and David Virelles, Mr. Bhatia proved he could hang with anyone in the jazz world. ""He would keep it on reserve and then suddenly unleash something really beautiful and terrifying and intense,"" Mr. Iyer, a MacArthur fellow, recalled in a phone interview.

But after recording ""Yes It Will,"" his 2012 debut that was more closely aligned with modern jazz sensibilities, Mr. Bhatia became disillusioned with the confines of the guitar and the staid conventions of acoustic jazz recording sessions. ""I felt I needed to make a radical break with my instrument and retool my whole vocabulary,"" he said. So he left his main instrument out of the creative process until the end, instead composing on Ableton Live, plug-ins and ""the wall that I banged my head against for a solid few years until the music finally started to make sense,"" he said with a laugh. As he labored on his own compositions, Mr. Bhatia jumped across another genre divide when he joined the indie-rock songwriter Ryan Lott in his band Son Lux in 2014. The pair found a kindred drive for disorientation, with Mr. Lott astounded by some of Mr. Bhatia's explorations upon first listen: ""What kind of brain thinks that this is O.K. -- and has the creative bravery to make it happen?"" he recalled wondering in an interview backstage at a recent Son Lux concert at Brooklyn Steel.

There are no conventional guitar solos on ""Breaking English"" -- perhaps a strange choice for someone so adept on the instrument. But as the album title suggests, its aim is to dismantle dominant languages and tendencies -- to capture ""what it would be like to fly over an undiscovered planet,"" Mr. Bhatia said. Now the only question is: What will he sound like next? ""You don't want an artist to put out the sequel -- you want them to come around with something that no one expected,"" Mr. Iyer said. ""I think he's got all that in him.""","The 30-year-old guitarist combines an eclectic mix of inspirations and interrogates his relationship to his main instrument on ""Breaking English.""",de9d564b-3a83-50be-9149-100f7e7f130d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/12/arts/12bhatia2/06bhatia2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=d25682733c4e8a9d03ce6b1831f5a4e73b2023469a1c1ae5d780268494019c23&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The 30-year-old guitarist Rafiq Bhatia moves easily between genres, cultures and recording techniques.",de9d564b-3a83-50be-9149-100f7e7f130d,N24News/imgs/de9d564b-3a83-50be-9149-100f7e7f130d.jpg,12
Food,Benoît Violier's Death Shines Light on High-Pressure Restaurant World,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/02/world/europe/benoit-violier-chef-dies.html,"Benoit Violier in 2013. The French-Swiss chef was found dead on Sunday at his home in Crissier, near Lausanne, Switzerland.

In the rarefied galaxy of restaurants that have received the Michelin guide's highest honor, three stars, Benoit Violier's, in Switzerland, was by one measure the most glittering. Only two months ago his establishment, the Restaurant de l'Hotel de Ville in Crissier, near Lausanne, was designated the best restaurant in the world in La Liste, rankings commissioned by the French Foreign Ministry -- an honor that only added luster to the glory of French chefs (he was born in France) in the face of competition from plucky foreign rivals. But on Monday, his friends and associates in the restaurant industry were groping to understand why Mr. Violier, at 44, had apparently shot himself to death over the weekend at his home in Crissier. And they asked whether he was the latest victim of a high-pressure world that demands perfection, shuns signs of weakness and promotes a culture where culinary demigods can be demoted with the stroke of a pen. Mr. Violier, a perfectionist known for his acumen in cooking game, ran the Restaurant de l'Hotel de Ville with his wife, Brigitte. It has been awarded three Michelin stars and in December took the No. 1 spot in La Liste, France's ranking of 1,000 restaurants in 48 countries.

The death was also provoking debate in the industry as to whether sufficient support structures were available for chefs grappling with the pressures of a physically and mentally demanding job that can be in thrall to capricious rankings and unforgiving food critics. In the United States, the close-knit restaurant world was shaken in April when Homaro Cantu, 38, the innovative chef behind Moto, a Michelin-starred avant-garde restaurant in Chicago's meatpacking district, hanged himself. He also owned a cafe, Berrista. Fellow chefs asked whether he had taken on too much and succumbed, as a celebrity chef, to the seemingly impossible demands for culinary prowess, media swagger and empire-building. In 2003, Bernard Loiseau, the chef and owner of the Cote d'Or, a Michelin three-star restaurant in the Burgundy region of France, committed suicide in his home at the age of 52. The French news media said he had been distraught over a slight demotion in the Gault & Millau guide, one of the world's most influential arbiters of culinary excellence, and was worried that he could lose a star in the next edition of the Michelin guide, widely considered the most powerful of them. ""It can't keep happening; it just can't,"" the food writer Kat Kinsman said on Monday. In January she started Chefs With Issues, a project aimed at illuminating the job-related stresses and mental illnesses afflicting many people in the food industry. Depression, anxiety, addiction and eating disorders are common.

Mental illness cuts across every profession, and medical experts warned that many individuals who commit suicide suffer from a severe mood disorder that can be triggered and exacerbated by many factors related to career, family, finances and health. But Ms. Kinsman and others in the industry said that restaurant work posed unique pressures that could contribute to self-destructive behavior, including suicide. Gabriel Waterhouse, who until recently was a chef in London at Galvin La Chapelle, which has one Michelin star, said star chefs like Mr. Violier operated in an extremely competitive atmosphere, in which speaking about fears was taboo. ""People are quite macho in the industry,"" he said, ""and people don't feel they can really talk about their problems or the stresses of what is being asked of them."" He added, ""It is considered a sign of weakness if you complain, and that is intensified the higher and higher you go."" Mr. Violier was born on Aug. 22, 1971, in La Rochelle, a coastal city in western France, to a family of winemakers. In 2013, he was named chef of the year by the Gault & Millau guide. ""It would seem that he has ended his life with a firearm,"" a statement by the police said, adding that an investigation had been opened. Towering figures of French cuisine, like the chefs Paul Bocuse and Marc Veyrat, paid homage to Mr. Violier, some expressing shock and remarking on his self-effacing demeanor and culinary artistry, which had garnered him many followers. The Michelin guide released its list of starred restaurants in France for 2016 on Monday, and although Mr. Violier's establishment is in Switzerland, he had been planning to attend a ceremony in Paris for the new rankings, according to the Swiss news media. Instead, the proceedings began with a minute of silence for him.

Patricia Zizza, who has worked by Mr. Bocuse's side for 40 years and has known some of the world's greatest chefs, including Mr. Violier, said the expectation of creating a masterwork every day could push some chefs to depression and exhaustion. ""Chefs are in the theater and must produce great work, and there is strong pressure to maintain that excellence,"" Ms. Zizza said. ""It requires an enormous amount of attention, from assuring the quality of the products to directing teams of people. And it entails many sacrifices, including to one's personal life."" She said Mr. Violier had been shaken by the death last year of his mentor, the Swiss chef Philippe Rochat, who died after falling ill while cycling. Mr. Violier and his wife began running the Restaurant de l'Hotel de Ville in 2012, after Mr. Rochat retired. Mr. Violier's survivors include his wife and their son, Romain, according to Swiss news outlets. La Liste was commissioned by the French Foreign Ministry, apparently as a response to the London-based World's 50 Best Restaurants. The British rankings were criticized by some in France as failing to give French restaurants their rightful due, but others in the culinary establishment regarded the French effort as misguided. When Mr. Violier was awarded the top place in La Liste's ranking in December, he responded with characteristic modesty. ""I feel a heavy responsibility to be named number one,"" he said in an interview with The New York Times, published in December. He added that the key to his success was consistency, not flashiness, and he singled out his loyal team, including Louis Villeneuve, his maitre d'hotel, who has been in his post for four decades. ""This ranking is a recognition of seriousness, of delivering the same fidelity and level of excellence from the beginning of January to the end of December,"" Mr. Violier said. ""It's a great tribute to the team.""","Mr. Violier ran the Restaurant de l'Hôtel de Ville in Switzerland, which was named the world's best in December.

Real Estate,The Hangover: Cantilevered Buildings of New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/realestate/cantilevered-buildings-of-new-york.html,"Casting a glance skyward in Manhattan these days may include the risk of beholding not sky but horizontal appendages that curve and jut outward from the sides of residential towers and hover like geometric mutants above the roofs of vertically challenged neighbors, inhabiting space once occupied by open air. Typically built of glass and steel and suspended in midair, they are not optical illusions. In fact, they are vista-grabbing, profit-generating cantilevers the likes of which Frank Lloyd Wright probably did not contemplate in 1935 when he designed a rural residence known as Fallingwater, which levitated, with assistance from cantilevers, above a 30-foot waterfall in Mill Run, Pa. Wright cantilevered for the aesthetic thrill of it. Piers and bridges cantilever for the sake of a design imperative. The cantilevered entrance of the former IBM building at 590 Madison Avenue, designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes & Associates, continues to be a piece of modernist eye candy that wows passers-by. But the escalating popularity of cantilevers in luxury residential (and some commercial) developments is apparently driven by -- what else? -- economics. With ""bigger is better"" the prevailing mantra among developers, cantilevers are getting bigger, too: superior apartment layouts are the desired endgame. Enabled by advances in technology -- structural steel and reinforced concrete have conspired to make load-bearing walls virtually obsolete -- cantilevers are the unsurprising sequel to the towers born of air-rights transfers, made feasible by a tweak to the city's zoning codes in 1961 that established density quotas for every neighborhood. Small properties that wished to stay that way could sell their excess rights to developers, and piles of such transfers resulted in some very tall residential buildings, like One57, 845 United Nations Plaza and 432 Park Avenue.

But why stop at building taller, when the opportunity presents itself to build wider via extensions into a neighbor's unused airspace? A rendering of 35XV, 35 West 15th Street, which will have two cantilevers, one over Xavier High School and a second over a rear courtyard. Cantilevers can be expensive and difficult to construct; some require support columns along the lines of the traditional flying buttress. But their ultimate cost-effectiveness is determined by the added square footage, and upgraded views, they bring to a project. Their advocates are not shy in pointing out that transfer fees are a source of serious income to properties willing to relinquish their option for future expansion. So long as they don't violate density quotas, and hover at a respectable distance above the neighbor's roof, cantilevers are also architectural catnip because they reward creativity. ""In New York, development is a three-dimensional chess game,"" said Dan Kaplan, a senior partner at FXFowle Architects, ""and the reason we're seeing an increase in the use of cantilevers above neighboring buildings is linked to the complexity of finding a site that can utilize all available development rights."" FXFowle incorporated a pair of eight-foot cantilevers at the Isis, 303 East 77th Street, a condo developed by Alchemy Properties. For Alchemy's new project, 35XV, FXFowle employed two cantilevers: the first extends west 17 feet into the airspace above Xavier High School, and the second projects 36 feet to the north over a rear courtyard.

In a sense, the cantilever is the urban iteration of the suburban dormer: it is both space-stretcher and brightener. According to Gerry Davis, an Alchemy principal, the cantilevers at 35XV account for some 40 percent of the square footage, in addition to providing improved views and a diversity of layouts. The building has 59 residential units on Floors 8 through 24. Alchemy paid $13.7 million for Xavier's development rights. ""In the 1920s they used to build straight up, with wedding-cake-type setbacks,"" Mr. Kaplan added. ""But with a cantilever, we can build outward as well as up, and in kind of an inversion of the wedding-cake theme, the floors are bigger toward the top, where space is more valuable. ""I picture it like a tree, where the trunk is the footprint and the building branches out above,"" he said. ""The ingenuity in the process, from a developer's point of view, is to take full advantage of every potential dimension a site has to offer, and the cantilever is a key strategy in that regard."" An optimally functioning cantilever is an essential design element, not an afterthought. Describing 35XV, Kenneth S. Horn, the president of Alchemy Properties, said, ""The first cantilever begins 85 to 90 feet above the ground, and by virtue of the way it's constructed, when you're inside your apartment, you'll literally feel like you can reach out and grab the Empire State Building."" The Extell Development Company has plans for the air, too. Its tower at 225 West 57th Street is to cantilever above an 1890s landmark, the Art Students League, to accommodate a 1,423-foot residential tower anchored by New York City's first Nordstrom department store.

Still, whether the cantilevers boldly sprouting all over town are marvels of architectural and engineering ingenuity or capricious eyesores inflicted by developers remains in the eye of the beholder. The Nordstrom cantilever (Extell's first) passed muster with the Landmarks Preservation Commission after Gary Barnett, Extell's president, testified that it was an essential element of the design. One dissenting commissioner, however, referred to it as a gimmick. There has also been grumbling about the 24-foot cantilever built by Toll Brothers City Living at 160 East 22nd Street, a 21-story, 81-unit condominium. The cantilever starts at the sixth floor and hangs above a pair of townhouses (neither is a landmark). The additional square footage allowed the developer to include an extra line of apartments. ""Some people may not like it,"" said David Von Spreckelsen, the president of the City Living division. ""But I think it adds an interesting modern component, and with people not willing to sell their property to you, but willing to sell their air rights, the cantilever almost becomes a necessity."" Cantilevers may be yet another fact of life in a city with a shortage of logical building sites but a seemingly inexhaustible appetite for new housing stock. ""They were more commonly in the back of buildings and out of view,"" said Vin Cipolla, the president of the Municipal Art Society. ""But with fewer highly desirable sites available, they're popping up to grab eye-popping views and are becoming integral design features. Design matters -- so is this good design? And what about environmental impact? There needs to be an understanding of these hyper-tall buildings and their effect on the streetscape."" When New York City began selling the rights to its airspace in earnest in the last few decades, the objective of the developers who bought them was usually to push the skyscraper envelope. Buy the unused air rights of stodgy structures next door, and suddenly a 25-story project on a lot of less-than-lordly proportions could attain impressive heights.

But what happens when vertical limitations are imposed on an already constricted or less-than-perfectly situated building site? What happens when a developer has spent millions of dollars on air rights to bolster a project and needs to find a way to use them that doesn't offend a neighborhood's contextual height and zoning codes? ""Cantilevers are being done around the city, very often in nonlandmarked areas,"" Mr. Barnett said, ""because there are a lot of places with height limitations, and cantilevering can get you a better layout and a larger floor plate."" ""In our case,"" he continued, ""the constraint was that we needed to accommodate Nordstrom, which is used to a wide-open, suburban-style layout. It wasn't critical to cantilever for the residential portion of the project, but we needed to give Nordstrom the largest possible floor plate, and as it turns out, the cantilever gives the apartments a bit better view shot, too."" On top of the original $23 million it spent for air rights, Extell paid the league nearly $30 million for the privilege of adding the cantilever. ""I wouldn't call it a donation,"" Mr. Barnett said, ""but I guess I'm happy it will assist an important and historic arts institution in making a huge chunk of some sorely needed repairs."" He added that the Nordstrom cantilever definitely wouldn't be Extell's last. Other developers are on the same wavelength. Of late, what's showing up at developments around Manhattan (and at 64 Bayard opposite McCarren Park in Brooklyn) is a profusion of cantilevers that exponentially expand square footage and can also, thanks to lot-line easements, legally transform unexceptional one- or two-bedroom units into three-bedroom beauties with fabulous light and, often, uniquely positioned outdoor space. The cantilevers at 56 Leonard Street in TriBeCa, a 57-story condominium that doesn't have a single terrace overshadowed by that of its immediate upstairs neighbor, epitomize that innovation. (The tower, designed by Herzog & de Meuron, paid New York Law School $150 million for land and air rights.)

At 64 Bayard, a 53-unit rental with two 16-foot cantilevers, ""it turned out to be an absolute home run for the developer, because each apartment in the cantilever has amazing views of Manhattan,"" said William Ross, a managing director of Halstead Property Development Marketing. A rendering of the Charles, a luxury tower at First Avenue and 73rd Street. The architect Ismael Leyva, whose firm has incorporated cantilevers in Midtown at Place 57 and the Icon and most recently at the Charles, a 31-story, 27-unit luxury tower at First Avenue and 73rd Street, says cantilevers have become the go-to option for developers. ""It's a good tool for increasing the ratio of salable square feet,"" Mr. Leyva said. ""And it gives a building a different external dynamic: you have the movement of intercepting shapes instead of the typical box."" The Landmarks Preservation Commission has reviewed the contextual appropriateness of cantilevers proposed at historic sites on just three occasions, two of them for the same site. Besides the Nordstrom tower, which it approved in October, the commission twice approved a cantilever for a condominium at 39-41 West 23rd Street, in the Ladies' Mile Historic District. The initial project was a victim of the downturn, but Anbau Enterprises bought the distressed site for $18.5 million in 2010 and eventually selected a redesign by Cook & Fox Architects that retained the cantilever. ""Our experience with cantilevers is sort of dramatic and intrinsically interesting,"" said Robert Tierney, the commission's chairman. It decided the cantilever above the Art Students League did not diminish the landmark, and on 23rd Street, it again ruled that the sculptural cantilever proposed for the condominium had been integrated into the design and was not an intrusion or a distraction at street level. But three approvals do not constitute blanket acceptance: ""I would say it would be the exception rather than the rule for us to find a cantilever appropriate,"" said Sarah Carroll, the commission's director of preservation. ""It is very site specific."" Barbara van Beuren, a managing partner at Anbau, is not a cantilever enthusiast. ""They've become an accepted part of building in the city now that you can build sideways if you own the air,"" she said. ""But it's expensive to build a pretty building, so they aren't always pretty, especially where Landmarks isn't there to hold your feet to the fire designwise. Some are not obtrusive; others are horrendous. They may make a project viable, but they're not easy to do, and I would never do one if given a choice.""

""On West 23rd Street,"" she added, ""we inherited a site and a design and wound up keeping the cantilever because it was a critical part of making the project work. We're proud of the design. We live in the 21st century, not the 19th, and even in a historic district, the point is not to reproduce what was. But the burden of proof is on the designer."" Nancy Belsky and her husband, Mark, who live in a Georgian colonial in the Boston suburbs, bought their 17th-floor penthouse at the Isis three years ago to use as a pied-a-terre. They were not looking to live in a cantilever building (she researched cantilevers after moving in). But they loved the apartment's layout the instant they opened the door. ""Besides the floor-to-ceiling windows and the two terraces,"" she said, ""there was this automatic, almost transcendent feeling, thrusting us into being a part of the beauty that is New York City. You don't feel contained; there's almost this Frank Lloyd Wright sense of being at one with your surroundings. It's like you're invited to be part of what's beyond your space."" Vertigo is not, she said, part of the experience. ""The ability to cantilever has been one of the real impetuses of modern architecture with a capital M,"" said Mr. Kaplan, whose firm designed the Isis. ""It's an opportunity to make a great design -- and it unlocks the potential inherent in development rights.""","Cantilevers are extending buildings sideways all over New York, establishing a new frontier for developers and disconcerting preservationists.",bc35e0c7-5144-56a2-8d58-0744b862dd5e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/12/realestate/12JUMP1/12JUMP1-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2014&h=398&w=600&s=849573371cbfe20322a08384232720d20272723cbab89d9b87699d5ff292fba0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"One of two 16-foot cantilevers at 64 Bayard Street, a rental in Brooklyn.",bc35e0c7-5144-56a2-8d58-0744b862dd5e,N24News/imgs/bc35e0c7-5144-56a2-8d58-0744b862dd5e.jpg,7
Automobiles,"The Ecstasy of Excess, the Agony of the Sticker",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/automobiles/autoreviews/the-ecstasy-of-excess-the-agony-of-the-sticker.html,"BIG SUR, Calif. -- Every carmaker makes compromises. Feature enhancements, like a little more legroom or a touch more horsepower, are weighed against the effect on a model's sticker price. But what if, in an alternative universe, money could bend the laws of physics, and vehicles were created only to transport mortals to the highest state of driving satisfaction? I pondered this at the Post Ranch Inn here, as a waiter poured a Thai herb broth -- infused with lemon grass and galangal root -- from a laboratory-style beaker over a single raw wild spot prawn, cooking it directly on the plate. I had arrived at the trendy resort perched above the Pacific Ocean in a $372,324 2014 Rolls-Royce Wraith, the most powerful Rolls ever produced. The Wraith is the automotive equivalent of molecular gastronomy, the cuisine that scientifically transforms familiar ingredients into otherworldly dishes. It is excruciating, elite and outrageously delicious. Before that moment at Post Ranch, I had never tasted -- really tasted -- a prawn. And my sense of what a vehicle can provide in terms of acceleration, cabin comfort and exacting design was fundamentally altered by several days spent driving the Wraith along the coast. The car's name, inspired by a soul-sucking ghost that casts spells and cannot be vanquished, is apropos.

Start with the whimsical touches in keeping with Rolls-Royce tradition. A crystal rotary controller at the driver's hand raises and lowers the flying lady statuette, the Spirit of Ecstasy, that graces the bonnet. Perhaps it's her voice, proper yet sultry, that provides the Wraith's turn-by-turn navigation voice guidance. Or is it a princess? Of course, there are the requisite his-and-hers three-foot umbrellas that spring from the door jambs with the push of a button. There is the lamb's wool that lines the floor of the cabin and boot, warm and soft underfoot when you slip off your loafers. But the signature feature is the Wraith's Starlight Headliner, consisting of 1,340 LEDs hand-sewn to create an effect of owning one's personal night sky filled with stars, the luminosity controlled by the driver. ""Because each optical fiber is cut by hand at a slightly different depth, each star has its own intensity,"" said Phil Harnett, the Wraith's product manager. ""So it looks like a real night sky."" The made-by-hand feature takes four days, and though it is the Wraith's most expensive stand-alone option at $12,925, it is one of the most popular. ""Due to demand, we had to look for another poor unfortunate soul to help the four guys who are doing the work,"" Mr. Harnett said. Who are the buyers creating this newfound job market for LED headliner stitches? ""It's no longer the Wall Street or real estate guys buying these in the U.S.,"" said James Warren, the company's communications manager for Britain and Scandinavia. ""It's the sickeningly clever and very wealthy, and really cool, pioneering dot-com guys, blokes in their late 20s and early 30s.""

Mr. Warren said that some of these early buyers were already talking about buying a second Rolls in the form of the more traditional limo-style Phantom or Ghost models. ""They just love jumping into the Wraith at the house in Malibu for a weekend blast,"" he said. ""But they wouldn't mind sitting in the Ghost during the week and tapping away at the laptop."" Well, Silicon Valley zillionaires, gag me with a silver spoon. While the Wraith is derived from the Ghost sedan, the fastback design creates an undeniably dashing profile. But at first I questioned the adoption of rear-hinged cabin doors on a 17-foot-long coupe weighing 5,380 pounds. The doors are big and heavy enough to be used on a bank vault and close with the same resolve. Fortunately, buttons on the front windshield pillars control the door with electronic precision. If seated in the rear, you'll have to make an undignified lunge to reach those controls -- or wait for a servant to release you. The doors, and the absence of a center roof pillar, create a wide opening, although the driver and front passenger must slide forward to allow entry to the back seat. Within a day, I realized that despite their considerable weight, the suicide doors were an absolute necessity. They make every step in or out of the Wraith a dramatic event for passengers, and a reason for roadside spectators to gawk. That's the idea, right? What I never doubted for a moment, and weeks later remains the Wraith's most indelible impression, is the Empire-size powertrain. The ability for this beast of a car to go from a standstill to 60 miles per hour in 4.4 seconds, or to reach a maximum speed of 155 m.p.h., is almost beside the point. It's the inexhaustibility of the acceleration that knocked off my Argyle socks. The sleek look and bounteous power give the Wraith a youthful edge over other Rolls models. ""We had to power up our 6.6-liter twin-turbo V12,"" said Mr. Harnett, noting that changing the intake and exhaust tuning helped to wring 60 more horses out of the engine, bringing the total horsepower to 624. Peak torque was increased to 590 pound-feet over a broad range of engine speeds, from 1,500 to 5,500 r.p.m. The Wraith is not meant to be an agile sports car. Instead, the brute force of its engine, the relaxed yet alert response from steering wheel movements and the syrupy 8-speed transmission combine to make the driving experience effortless. The Wraith is not about feeling the road. It's about owning it. Close those Bank of England doors, and the Wraith and its passengers are hermetically sealed from any world outside its own existence. The transitions from one gear to the next are imperceptible unless you mash the accelerator to the floor. In that event, the engine doesn't roar or rumble so much as it gently vibrates in low hushed tones.

Driving at 65 m.p.h. felt like crawling. That's why I relied on cruise control for long highway stretches. I've driven other cars with adaptive cruise control, a radar-based system that reduces the speed of a vehicle when the car ahead slows down. But the Wraith's cruising system -- borrowed from the tech labs of BMW, Rolls's parent company -- was much more effective, bringing the vehicle to a complete stop for as long as the car in front was halted, waiting as attentively as a hunting hound and springing back to action when traffic started to move again. The technology sharing between BMW and Rolls-Royce is reciprocal. The engineers in England developed the Wraith's Satellite Aided Transmission, which uses GPS-based data to anticipate the need for gear shifts before the road climbs or turns. Mr. Harnett likened the technology to other perks of the one percent: ""The satellite data transmission is basically doing everything for you, in an incredibly subtle and aiding way, like a perfect butler or valet will take care of you as a person,"" he said. The technology could one day be shared with BMW vehicles. The Wraith has enough high-tech wizardry to make Hogwarts administrators envious. The list includes a night-vision camera and high beams that automatically engage when the coast is clear. But designers have also left tangible analog features for hands to touch, from 1930s-style radio buttons to organ-stop manual plungers that let you precisely control the flow of air in the cabin. ""There is still a relevance and place for the haptic reassurance of touching a beautiful material, or playing with the nice knurling on the bezel, or fettling with a knob that's beautifully weighted,"" Alex Innes, Rolls's bespoke designer, said in a telephone interview. It's hard not to be impressed with the careful consideration of every element -- down to the self-righting wheel centers that always display the Rolls-Royce logo upright. Heaven forbid they should spin like a common clothes dryer. But those features, many of them handcrafted, and the exorbitant price, create a conundrum. One can't help but play the game of searching high and low for the slightest flaws. You could argue, for instance, that the car's length makes it unwieldy for city maneuvers and parking. And you could certainly criticize the Wraith's fuel-thirsty ways. I managed 14 miles per gallon in combined city-highway driving, and 17 m.p.g. for my concluding trip down the coast to Southern California to return the car. The official federal rating is 13 m.p.g. in town and 21 on the highway, earning the Wraith a $1,700 gas guzzler tax.

When Rolls-Royce granted me the Wraith test car with the provision that I drive it from the Bay Area to Los Angeles in time for the opening of the auto show there, I knew immediately whom I wanted as my co-pilot. Six weeks earlier my dear friend Jack Tuller underwent his second operation to remove a brain tumor. Miraculously, he emerged from surgery with his charm and good spirit, but without his ability to drive. As a result, Jack often feels deprived of mobility. So he jumped at the opportunity for the road trip, especially since the route included majestic Highways 1 and 101. On the 10-hour drive, which flew by in what seemed like minutes, we got into a deep discussion. Jack has come to regard the removal of part of his brain as the cleaving away of many superficial things in his life. I suppose you could include a showy luxury vehicle, so far beyond the reach of most mortals, among those things. But the Wraith's craftsmanship and prowess managed to suppress our impulse to ridicule. The car is the very embodiment of excess, yet ultimately we felt fortunate to be among the few people to experience it, particularly on such a spectacular drive. At one point, Jack, who too often these days can't access the names of familiar things, deftly summed up the experience. ""I know it's just a car,"" he said. ""But when you're driving a Rolls-Royce, it makes you feel good about your life.""","The Roll-Royce Wraith, derived from the Ghost sedan, offers an almost $400,000 driving experience that seems to avoid compromises.",8f0162cc-13cd-5ea1-9e5f-08a2015be0e8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/26/automobiles/Wheel1/Wheel1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=305&w=600&s=1d4f9af5be7655d883b9279934805e12921953af75f1ac38be45939511b39b96&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"The Rolls-Royce Wraith near Half Moon Bay, Calif.",8f0162cc-13cd-5ea1-9e5f-08a2015be0e8,N24News/imgs/8f0162cc-13cd-5ea1-9e5f-08a2015be0e8.jpg,23
Music,The Only Music Critic Who Matters (if You're Under 25),https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/arts/music/anthony-fantano-the-needle-drop.html,"Anthony Fantano reviews albums and songs on his YouTube channel, The Needle Drop, bringing an old art to a new medium -- and perhaps ensuring it has a future.

A few years ago, the Rhode Island noise rock band Daughters had an unlikely breakthrough, thanks in no small part to a goofy, baldheaded online enthusiast. The group had just released its first new album in eight years, and although the music's punishing heaviness wasn't exactly welcoming to a wide audience, Daughters' tour had sold out and its label noticed a sudden spike in sales and streams, the drummer Jon Syverson recalled. Syverson, who was approaching 40, even heard from a cousin half his age, who'd excitedly tried to explain the uptick in attention. ""Oh my God,"" the teenager told him, ""The Melon reviewed your album, he wore the yellow flannel and gave it a 10 out of 10!"" Syverson had no idea what his cousin was talking about. But to a certain subset of young music fans, Daughters might as well have hit the Powerball jackpot.

The influential evangelist in question is the YouTuber named Anthony Fantano, 34, who has been speaking album and song reviews directly into a camera for more than a decade on The Needle Drop, his channel with 2.26 million subscribers, making him probably the most popular music critic left standing. Across thousands of videos on multiple platforms, including a recent partnership with the Amazon-owned livestreaming site Twitch, Fantano has built up a legion of followers and imitators who trade in nicknames (""Melon"" is for the critic's pale dome), inside jokes and Easter eggs (wearing a yellow flannel shirt signals a rave, red flannel means a pan). Along the way, he has helped to push a notoriously insular and endangered art form -- the record review -- toward a new default medium and younger audience.

""Obviously a lot of what is around now is heavily influenced by my aesthetic, my style, my delivery,"" Fantano, a vegan teetotaler, said recently over FaceTime, where he was as long-winded as in his videos, which often top 10 minutes. He noted that while he was not the first to bring the early YouTuber, articulate-rant treatment to music, he was meticulous about crafting his channel, studying competitors, including websites that still relied on the written word, and keeping his approach simple, intimate and communal. ""I was eating, sleeping and bleeding YouTube for quite a long time,"" he said. ""I had consciously chosen something that I found to be really uncomplicated, because I envisioned the delivery and the makeup as being something that was easy to copy, so other people could get in on the conversation."" This month, Fantano posted a video on Twitter that seemed to prove his point, showing a child reviewing a new album by the rapper 6ix9ine with a preternatural bluster obviously modeled on his own. Lucas, 11, said he spent ""hours a day, for years"" watching Fantano and other YouTube music reviewers like Shawn Cee before building a bare-bones basement setup during the pandemic and starting a channel of his own.

With more than 900 million views across his YouTube accounts, Fantano, who functions as an entertainer as much as a critic, has become a touchstone among music-focused, millennial and Gen Z content creators even as they refine and expand upon his format on platforms like TikTok. Dev Lemons, a musician and college student whose @SongPsych account does bite-size criticism by-way-of music theory and news, called Fantano ""a celebrity and an authority"" among her cohort. ""I know so many people that just won't listen to something because Anthony Fantano was like, 'It's not worth your time,'"" she said, noting that she has ""looked into Pitchfork before,"" but mainly consumes video reviews. ""There's so much more personality,"" she said. Another college student and musician, Ethan Fields, 20, has used his time at home during the pandemic to build a TikTok fan base, savvily interpreting popular songs in the style of other musicians. Fantano, Fields said, was an early influence on his knowing and silly insidery content.

""I don't think there's anyone else like him, who's had that reach,"" Fields said. ""If you told somebody on the street, 'Name a music critic right now,' if they're under the age of 25, they'll say, 'Anthony Fantano.'"" (Asked if he could even name another music critic, Fields had to take a moment. ""Ummmm, let's see ... honestly ... I'm trying to think. There's a guy from Rolling Stone who loves U2?"" he said. ""David Fricke?"") The old guard has not exactly embraced Fantano. Robert Christgau, a rock critic for more than half a century, has called Fantano's career an ""achievement,"" but sniffed, ""I don't 'watch' reviews. I read writing."" In an email, Christgau added, ""I literally never think about Anthony Fantano and would probably have trouble recalling his name. This isn't a dis -- I don't know his work well enough to dis it.""

Over the years, Fantano has professionalized -- working with a managing editor, a video editor, a booking agent and an entertainment lawyer (whose son was a fan) -- but the look and feel of his videos has hardly changed since he started The Needle Drop in 2009, with a plain backdrop and a digital representation of the album cover in question over his right shoulder. Such consistency, a result of his type-A workaholism, has been crucial to Fantano's success. His output is regular and optimized: a review almost every weekday, plus immediate reactions to new tracks, music news and other recurring features on his second channel, which he started in 2017 to circumvent the YouTube algorithm. (""The more content you're dropping on a single channel, the less likely it is that YouTube is going to appropriately promote all of it,"" he said.) His critical voice -- earnest, adjective-heavy enthusiasm mixed with boyish, 4chan-inflected internet humor -- and his taste, which can be eclectic but skews toward heavy rock, outre and experimental pop and rock-influenced rap, are also reliable. The only five albums to earn a perfect 10 from him are by Kendrick Lamar, the noise-rap trio Death Grips, the Kids See Ghosts duo of Kanye West and Kid Cudi, the aggressive rock band Swans, and Daughters, which he praised for its ""nuclear bomb of cathartic hideousness"" and ""vile displays of auditory abuse."" Predictably, The Needle Drop's most popular videos take on polarizing stars like West, Eminem and Chance the Rapper, but Fantano often avoids big-ticket Top 40, which could bring him more views, in favor of proselytizing for something smaller or stranger. He referred to what he does as giving a ""synopsis or CliffsNotes"" for an artist or album, but also obviously values his role as a curator and tastemaker, too. ""There's no number of negative reviews I can give to Nav that can end his career,"" Fantano said, referencing his takedowns of the slyly popular rapper. ""But I feel like I can break an artist -- I do have the power to do that.""

At Southern Connecticut State University, Fantano threw himself into the college radio station, eventually becoming its general manager. Graduating into the dawn of a recession, he worked at a pizza place and interned at a local NPR station, where he briefly wrote about music and helmed a little-heard podcast that anticipated The Needle Drop. But an editor's headline on a story he wrote, which inflamed Bob Dylan fans, convinced Fantano that he only wanted to work for himself. It was a golden age of music blogs, and Fantano was watching the landscape shift underneath the usual gatekeepers, he said. But he struggled to build an audience for his personal website until he hit on an idea to stand out: ""Just get on camera."" A bigger fan of Tim & Eric and ""South Park"" than Greil Marcus and Lester Bangs, Fantano felt no fealty toward the rock critical establishment, and said he was only ever an occasional reader of Pitchfork, the defining music publication of his generation. ""Me and some of my friends thought it was funny when they did the Jet, monkey pee-pee video, you know?"" he said, referring to an album review that was simply a crass YouTube clip. Having spent a lot of time on the vulgar message board 4chan, Fantano infused his internet presence with winks, contrarian irreverence and attempts at humor, like a recurring ""roommate"" character that is just Fantano in a fake mustache. He became a favorite of the 4chan music forum known as /mu/, but Fantano's flirtation with that world also led to controversy when he was accused in a 2017 article in The Fader of courting the alt-right with a spinoff channel that reviewed memes instead of music. The article was later deleted amid a settlement, and both sides are bound by a nondisclosure agreement. Fantano said he started that channel to make more money from YouTube, and acknowledged that there were some ""grubby, close-minded, young, aggressive male types hovering around the content."" (The Needle Drop's audience on YouTube is only 6.5 percent female.) He said 4chan was ""toxic and problematic,"" yet also ""where most internet humor draws back to -- all of us are guilty of that original sin, in a way.""

In the years since, he has become more vocal on social justice issues, adding, ""My politics have become, as a result of reading things online, more intersectional."" He chalked up the backlash he has faced to jealousy. ""There's an element of, 'I would like to be in that guy's shoes,'"" he said. ""Maybe people feel like I'm not entitled to my platform."" Ultimately, it's Fantano's self-image as an outsider that continues to animate much of his work, even as he has become hugely popular, a sort-of gatekeeper of his own. Still, he maintains almost no relationship with record labels or the broader music industry, and said he has turned down numerous offers to be absorbed by a larger brand. ""I don't want to have to sell my soul to basically make the same amount of money I'm making now,"" he said. As for the future of music criticism and his role in it, Fantano could only blow a raspberry. Does he even care? ""In the traditional sense, probably not a lot,"" he said after a long pause. Whether it's Instagram posts, TikTok videos or Twitter threads, Fantano added, ""What's most important to me is not the form that it takes, or the vehicle that it's being driven to me in, but really that it's observant, that it's passionate, and that the people who are doing it care.""","Anthony Fantano reviews albums and songs on his YouTube channel, The Needle Drop, bringing an old art to a new medium — and perhaps ensuring it has a future.",007a6981-a6d7-52dc-ad77-000abc9d07d8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/04/arts/04anthony-fantano1/04anthony-fantano1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=166aac5d1c65b4c1fb09408591b6af749d2101b60040bc8bc40e92d0a85be100&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Anthony Fantano has been speaking music reviews directly into a camera for more than a decade.

Theater,Review: An 'Evita' Newly Tailored for Our Time,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/theater/evita-city-center-review.html,"If you lived in New York in the years after ""Evita"" arrived on Broadway in 1979, or for that matter in Argentina at any time since 1949, you know the dress: a white strapless ball gown, fairy-dusted with spangles, fitted like a bandage at the bodice and billowing into a parade float below. The Dior original that Eva Peron wore to the theater and the version of it that Patti LuPone wore to sing ""Don't Cry for Me, Argentina"" in the show have each, in their way, come to signify brutal glamour, in governance as in musicals. That dress -- reinterpreted by the Argentine designer Alejo Vietti -- has been lifted out of its various contexts to become the central image of the director Sammi Cannold's smart yet unpersuasive production of ""Evita,"" which opened on Wednesday as the annual gala production for New York City Center. When you enter the theater, it is hanging from the flies, glittering but baleful, like a carapace or an iron maiden. If that seems about right as a concept, it's a touch academic as entertainment, a pattern that Cannold's staging maintains throughout. ""Evita"" is already a ""concept"" musical, derived from a 1976 concept album by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice and originally realized on Broadway by a director, Harold Prince, whose take was deliberately chilly. Luckily, the performances of his stars -- LuPone and, as a narrator figure called Che, Mandy Patinkin -- were instinctively emotional, and the clash of temperatures was thrilling.

But Cannold's interpretation, based in part on work she did for her undergraduate thesis at Stanford, is even more analytical than Prince's. Aside from separating the dress from the woman, she has separated the woman from herself: Eva is played from age 15 through 20 by Maia Reficco and as an adult by Solea Pfeiffe r. Even after the girl turns into the woman, in the middle of the song ""Buenos Aires,"" she hovers over the rest of the action as a caution.

The result, as it must be for 2019, is a more ambivalent, feminist reading of Argentina's first lady, lay saint and lightning rod. But it's also, for much of its two hours, more muddled and less engaging. When we see, for instance, how middle-aged men use an obviously teenage Eva sexually as she sleeps her way from poverty in the sticks to glory in the capital, we are properly repulsed and yet confused about the message. If she's the men's victim how is she also, in deliberately bedding them with no long-term interest, their victimizer? Though it's sensible to posit that Eva could be both, the libretto -- which is unchanged except for the interpolation of the song ""You Must Love Me"" from the 1996 movie -- doesn't give Cannold enough to support and develop the idea. It also leaves her with a problem that comes to feel like a hangover, as young Eva has little to do for most of the show but wander around with her valise like a refugee from ""Les Miz."" ""Evita"" is already overloaded with symbols. Most of its characters are abstractions, and so are most of its conflicts. Eva's chief antagonist isn't her husband, the quasi-fascist Juan Peron (Enrique Acevedo), but Che (Jason Gotay), a generalized man of the people and freelance cynic. The plot unrolls like a military campaign seen from above on a strategy map, with the ensemble divided into armies representing the haughty rich, the cutthroat military and the impoverished descamisados. Cannold's production, with its additional symbolic superstructure and shaky use of the stage, is often too fragmented to produce the effects the show's creators intended. I am not really endorsing those effects; deliberately or not, they give moral status to characters who don't deserve it, just by letting them sing. Cannold undercuts that, forcing us to confront our complicity in enjoying them as entertainment. But of course, in the process they become less entertaining.

As Eva, Pfeiffer -- an Eliza in ""Hamilton"" who also made a splash in the Encores! Off-Center production of ""Songs for a New World"" -- bears the brunt of this problem. She looks and sounds smashing throughout, but fully comes into her own only in the second half, when a concrete if interior conflict -- Eva's health -- emerges. Acevedo is vocally lustrous but dramatically inert as the underwritten Peron. It's left to Gotay to hold things together, which he does with a beautifully sung, consistently wry performance . But Cannold deploys him haphazardly onstage, like a mouse in a maze; whenever he builds up a righteous rage, he's forced to scuttle away.

In its historical hugeness and skimpy script, ""Evita"" will always require such trade-offs. Lloyd Webber gives you his most inventive, supple music, unsingable though much of it may be, then cleverly reprises it before finally ramming it into your ear. Rice occasionally interrupts his mis-accented, mixed-metaphor lyrics with hooks so pointed they rip your skin. The overall idea of beatifying while beating up on Evita is likewise fatally compromised. So it's encouraging that Cannold's approach, however equivocal, works even as well as it does. Part of that is its physical and sonic beauty: not just Vietti's costumes but also Jason Sherwood's white-flower bier of a set, Bradley King's ardent lighting and the orchestra, under the direction of Kristen Blodgette, playing Lloyd Webber's revised orchestration for the 2012 Broadway revival. Hiring a predominantly Latin o cast is another decision that pays off. Whether we need an ""Evita"" that helps to humanize a woman who enabled a dictator is a matter of taste. For me, I'll just say that the gorgeous dress is now more impressive on a hanger than it ever was when worn.

Sports,"U.F.C. 249 Is Off After Requests From California, Disney and ESPN",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/sports/ufc-249-canceled.html,"U.F.C. 249, a mixed-martial arts showcase scheduled for April 18 on Native American tribal land in California, was canceled on Thursday in response to apprehension about holding the event during the coronavirus pandemic. California state officials intervened by directly expressing their concerns about the event to Disney, the parent company of the U.F.C.'s broadcast partner, ESPN, according to three people with knowledge of the conversations. Dana White, the U.F.C. president, said in an interview on ESPN that he had received calls from ""the highest level"" of leadership at Disney and ESPN asking him not to hold the event, which would have featured 12 fights. ESPN holds the rights to televise U.F.C. fights and to sell its pay-per-view events, a lucrative relationship that yields the vast majority of the U.F.C.'s revenue. ""The powers that be there asked me to stand down and not do this event next Saturday,"" White said. That request came after Gov. Gavin Newsom of California called Disney officials, according to one of the people familiar with the conversations. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share the details of the calls.

Disney declined to comment, and Newsom's office did not respond to a request for comment. ""ESPN has been in constant contact with the U.F.C. regarding U.F.C. 249,"" ESPN said in a statement. ""Nobody wants to see sports return more than we do, but we didn't feel this was the right time for a variety of reasons. ESPN expressed its concerns to the U.F.C. and they understood."" An hour before White announced the cancellation, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California had called for the event to be postponed. In a statement, she said that ""at best this event ties up medical resources and sends a message that shelter-in-place orders can be flouted"" and that ""at worst, participants and support staff could carry the virus back to their home communities and increase its spread."" The card was originally scheduled for Barclays Center in Brooklyn, but was moved after Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York restricted mass gatherings and the New York State Athletic Commission announced it wouldn't authorize the event, The fights were then to be held at the Tachi Palace Casino Resort, on tribal land in Central California about 40 miles south of Fresno. In staging the event on tribal land, the U.F.C. was attempting to get around stay-at-home orders that have been issued in nearly every state, including California, as well as federal social distancing guidelines. California state regulators refused to authorize the event, and most state athletic commissions aren't approving fights during the pandemic. As a result, the U.F.C. would have had to provide its own referees, judges, medical staff and other services to make the bouts happen.

The Tachi-Yokut Tribe, part of the federally recognized Santa Rosa Indian Community, owns the Tachi Palace Casino Resort. They have sovereignty over their land and can set whatever rules they want, though the casino was closed the night of March 20 because of the pandemic. But because of a nearly 70-year-old federal law, Public Law 280, California state and local officials have broad authority to intervene in criminal and civil matters on tribal land. By expressing their concerns to Disney, California state officials avoided a potentially complicated and uncomfortable situation with the Tachi-Yokut. The U.F.C. had previously canceled three events that were scheduled for March and April, and White said on Thursday that his efforts to keep U.F.C. 249 intact had been ""a battle since Day 1."" He has insisted that he was being cautious and could safely hold the fights even amid a pandemic and despite a number of medical, legal and regulatory challenges. As recently as Wednesday night, the event's key stakeholders were adamant that it would go ahead, noting that the U.F.C. was able to host fights in an empty arena in Brazil last month. ""Precedent has been set, and Dana knows that he can pull this off in a very safe and controlled way that will keep his fighters and the crew safe,"" Mark Shapiro, the president of Endeavor, said in a telephone interview Wednesday night. Endeavor led the group that purchased the U.F.C. in 2016. Disney is based in Burbank, Calif., and has extensive financial interests in the state, through its theme parks, movie and television studios, and its Pixar and Lucasfilm subsidiaries. ESPN does not control U.F.C.'s fight schedule, but it has substantial influence over the company given the strong financial ties between the two organizations. ""These are people that I am partners with, people whom I have a lot of respect with, and I'm going to do it, I'm going to say yes,"" White said about the requests from Disney and ESPN to postpone the fight.

In 2018, ESPN agreed to pay the U.F.C. $1.5 billion over five years to show 30 events annually on the network's cable channels and on its ESPN+ streaming service. ESPN executives have credited the U.F.C. with being a major driver of ESPN+ subscriptions, and the agreement was deemed such a success that just one year later it was extended by two years and ESPN also bought the exclusive rights to sell and stream U.F.C.'s pay-per-view events. The value of the latter deal was not announced, but the U.F.C.'s pay-per-view events typically earn hundreds of millions of dollars annually. ESPN was going to charge $64.99 to watch U.F.C. 249. Shapiro said that business considerations were not behind the U.F.C.'s unwavering desire to hold U.F.C. 249 despite a worldwide pandemic, and that ESPN had not pressured them to go forward. The U.F.C. produces all of its own events, sending video feeds to ESPN to televise, and ESPN would not have had any production staff on the ground in California. ""The U.F.C.'s contractual relationship with ESPN has absolutely nothing to do with this decision,"" Shapiro said on Wednesday. ""ESPN has been clear about that."" The headline fight for U.F.C. 249 was originally a lightweight title bout between Khabib Nurmagomedov and Tony Ferguson, one of the U.F.C.'s most anticipated matchups in years. But Nurmagomedov traveled from San Jose, Calif., where he was training, to his home in the Dagestan region of Russia as White was still trying to find a backup location for the fight. Then Nurmagomedov withdrew when it became clear he would have problems traveling back to the United States to compete. Earlier on Thursday, Brian Butler, the manager of the strawweight fighter Rose Namajunas, said she had withdrawn from her bout in U.F.C. 249 because two of her family members had died. Their deaths, Butler said, ""were related to the coronavirus.""","Dana White, the U.F.C. president, has been aiming to stage fights during the coronavirus pandemic, but he said the card would not be held on April 18, as originally planned.",2afe7bed-e0eb-5ac9-9570-42b03d571bd2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/10/sports/09ufc-web-print/09ufc-web-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=d8829d7bc45e93db995641dbd8ff1a81490e2150bca51831eb794a4979f59ec7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, had planned to hold a 12-fight card on April 18 on tribal land in California.",2afe7bed-e0eb-5ac9-9570-42b03d571bd2,N24News/imgs/2afe7bed-e0eb-5ac9-9570-42b03d571bd2.jpg,9
Sports,Why Phil Jackson Needs 'The Last Dance',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/sports/basketball/phil-jackson-michael-jordan-last-danc.html,"In this week's newsletter, Marc Stein explains how Jackson's legacy as a winning coach was tarnished -- and how Michael Jordan's new documentary can help.

Want more basketball in your inbox? Sign up for Marc Stein's weekly N.B.A. newsletter here. When the Chicago Bulls were assembling a 72-10 season in 1995-96, Nick Nurse was a young Phil Jackson fan in England, earning roughly $20,000, along with housing and a car, as the new head coach of the Birmingham Bullets. His favorite indulgence at the time, at the cost of 10 British pounds per week, was the weekly delivery of VHS tapes of Bulls games from a European distributor called PonTel. Whenever he could make time, sometimes in the company of his American players, Nurse voraciously studied Jackson's triangle offense, his substitutions and everything else. [Read more on the death of Michael Jordan's father, James Jordan.] ""There was nothing on TV but soccer and cricket, so I was watching every game I got 10, 12 times,"" Nurse said. ""Phil was my mentor, and he didn't even know it."" Nurse and Jackson didn't meet until the summer of 2018, shortly after Nurse was hired as coach of the Toronto Raptors. Alex McKechnie, the Raptors' vice president for player health and performance and an alumnus of Jackson's staff with the Los Angeles Lakers, connected them. Soon after, Nurse was in Montana -- summoned for what became a three-day coaching retreat with the Zen Master.

It was a hard-to-believe prelude to what became a fairy-tale rookie season on the Raptors' bench with their run to an N.B.A. title. ""It was a big thrill for me,"" Nurse said of his summit with Jackson. When reached on Monday night, on the first day that ""The Last Dance"" documentary about the Bulls' 1997-98 season had been distributed outside the United States by Netflix, Nurse was home with his family in Toronto, engrossed in the first two episodes like so many viewers had been on Sunday night. Michael Jordan's career and life are the overwhelming focus of the 10-part series, but Nurse was always drawn more to Jackson's career arc -- thanks to his rise from five coaching stops in a league far, far away from the N.B.A. galaxy in England, and through the N.B.A.'s developmental league, to the Raptors. Not everyone watching will be as familiar as Nurse is with Jackson's own improbable climb from the Albany Patroons of the Continental Basketball Association to securing Jordan's undying loyalty. Yet that is what helps position Jackson to emerge as one of the big winners when ""The Last Dance"" completes its five-week run next month. This documentary, with a title Jackson inspired, will highlight for viewers what a coaching colossus Jackson was before his unsuccessful detour into management at Madison Square Garden.

Jackson may be the ultimate winner among N.B.A. coaches, with 11 championship rings, but it has been a while since his copious success with the Bulls and the Lakers was the first thing people referenced about him. Such is the unyielding consistency of the James L. Dolan-owned Knicks in besmirching the reputation of seemingly every marquee name who has tried to steer the franchise back to respectability over the past two decades. As a result, Jackson has heard far more in recent years about his front-office foibles than the bench excellence that preceded it. You wouldn't think a coach who owns two more rings than Red Auerbach would have legacy concerns, but Jackson's rocky three-year stint as the Knicks' president of basketball operations cast that sort of shadow. So it will be a huge boost for Jackson, at 74, for basketball fans of all ages to be reacquainted with (or introduced to) his lofty place in the hierarchy of a dynasty that ruled the N.B.A. six times in an eight-season span in the 1990s. No one in ""The Last Dance,"" mind you, wins more than Jordan. Despite a woefully mediocre run as the owner of the Charlotte Hornets for the past 10 years, His Airness has broken away from his long-held reclusive tendencies -- at just the right time to reclaim the rapt attention of the American sporting public that, thanks to Covid-19, was forced to quit its normal viewing habits cold turkey. The likely result: Irrespective of any criticism to come from the fact that he clearly had more control over the project than advertised, as explained here by my colleague Sopan Deb, so much fresh documentary buzz seems certain to help Jordan re-establish a gulf between him and LeBron James or anyone else you wish to nominate as basketball's best player of all time. Next up, though, it's Scottie Pippen and Jackson who appear poised to land closest to Jordan when the documentary's ultimate list of beneficiaries and villains is compiled. ""I never even felt like Phil got enough credit when it was happening because of Michael's presence, or when he went to L.A. and having Kobe and Shaq there,"" said Golden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr, another key figure in the documentary after spending three and a half seasons as Jordan's teammate under Jackson. ""I think people always underestimated Phil's talent as a coach, but he was so brilliant and so unique in his style,"" Kerr continued. ""With all the fame and notoriety that surrounded the team and Michael in particular, Phil was just an incredible leader and coach. Very few, if any, people would have had the right skill set and temperament to keep a team like that together and moving forward.""

None of this is meant to absolve Jackson's mistakes with the Knicks. He took a job he clearly didn't have the background for, after consciously staying out of personnel matters for much of his coaching career, and will always take the hit for Joakim Noah's horrendous contract, his frayed relationships with Carmelo Anthony and Kristaps Porzingis and his two questionable coaching hires (Derek Fisher and Jeff Hornacek) after Kerr spurned New York (and, yes, Phil) to take the Golden State job. It's likewise true that Jackson, so often branded as smug by rival coaches and critics in the news media and the source of occasionally caustic quotations (and tweets), was never going to generate much sympathy -- even when we have heard or seen little from him since his exit from the Knicks nearly three years ago. Yet it's striking in the film to repeatedly see how devoted Jordan was to Jackson and hear so clearly that he was willing to play for no one else in Chicago. Ditto for the complexities Jackson faced in managing Pippen, Dennis Rodman and the two Jerrys -- Jerry Reinsdorf, the Bulls' owner, and Jerry Krause, the general manager -- who indefensibly conspired to hasten the breakup of a dynasty rather than doing everything they could to hold it together. It also turns out, as confirmed by his counsel to Nurse, that Phil does have a softer side. Nurse booked a three-day trip for their Montana meeting two summers ago unsure of what to expect. ""I figured if it was only for a cup of coffee, I'd just hang out for a couple days and regroup,"" Nurse said. They ended up sharing meal after meal over the course of Nurse's stay and spent so much time on various aspects of the craft that they never really got around to swapping Rodman stories -- with Nurse having briefly coached a 44-year-old Rodman with the Brighton Bears in England in 2006. ""He was really gracious with his time,"" Nurse said. ""We talked a lot of basketball, we talked a lot of leadership, we talked a lot of basketball history and we talked a lot of just commanding the team."" As he waits out a pandemic now like the rest of the N.B.A., unsure how soon the defending champion Raptors will be allowed to return to work in a league in which 29 other teams sit on the opposite side of the United States-Canada border, Nurse can't help but hark back to his Birmingham Bullets days -- back when the Friday drop-off of those Bulls tapes was the highlight of the week.

You ask; I answer. Every week in this space, I'll field three questions posed via email at marcstein-newsletter@nytimes.com. (Please include your first and last name, as well as the city you're writing in from, and make sure ""Corner Three"" is in the subject line.) Q: Here are a few possible ways to honor David Stern's legacy:
* None Since he really was the Godfather of the W.N.B.A., maybe the W.N.B.A. championship trophy or Most Valuable Player trophy could be named in his honor.
* None The N.B.A.'s All-Star Weekend could be rebranded ""David Stern All-Star Weekend.""
* None David's signature could be etched on the hardwood of every team's floor, like it used to appear on the league's official ball.
* None The N.B.A. draft could also be rebranded with David's name. -- Bruce Bernstein (Connecticut) Stein: Perhaps you'll recall that we led off Corner Three last week with a question about the challenges of naming a major trophy after the league's former commissioner Stern, who died on Jan. 1. The primary complication is that many of the N.B.A.'s major honors have already been dedicated to other giants of the game.

I admittedly struggled to propose immediate suggestions, but the longtime ESPN producer Bruce Bernstein -- one of my dearest friends in the business -- dutifully compiled this smart list. Bernstein worked on various N.B.A. shows at ESPN for nearly 40 years and had an unenviable task for about 15 of them: coaching me to be functional on television. Bruce also has particular insight into working at close range with Stern after numerous N.B.A. drafts during which he was charged with ushering the commissioner on and off stage to announce first-round picks. In typical fashion, Bernstein came up with multiple suggestions that merit further discussion. No matter where you stand on Stern, as an admirer or critic of his demanding (some would dictatorial) leadership style, it certainly makes sense for both the N.B.A. and the W.N.B.A. to pay tribute to him in grand fashion. Q: Can't believe so many people would have missed Kobe to watch that Warriors game. -- @CookeFranklin1 from Twitter Stein: This was a tweeted response to my recent fond recollections of the final night of the 2015-16 season, when Golden State claimed its record-breaking 73rd win while Kobe Bryant was scoring 60 points in his final N.B.A. game. For a television viewer, as the tone of the tweet suggests, it made total sense that Kobe would be the draw for the masses. A player of such stature rumbling for 60 points in his farewell is a feat that will never be duplicated. Yet the same can be said for the Warriors' achievement. At least that's my prediction: I don't think another team will ever win 73 games in an 82-game season. Especially in the load-management era that the league swiftly entered after Golden State went 73-9.

Andy Thompson had four N.B.A. tryouts before joining N.B.A. Entertainment in 1987 and hatching the idea to travel with the Chicago Bulls throughout the 1997-98 season, which was the original spark for ""The Last Dance"" documentary. The brother of the two-time N.B.A. champion Mychal Thompson and the uncle of the Warriors' Klay Thompson', Andy Thompson was cut by the San Diego Clippers, the Portland Trail Blazers and the Seattle SuperSonics (twice) after playing at the University of Minnesota. Mychal Thompson was the No. 1 pick in the 1978 N.B.A. draft out of the same school. ""I always tell Mychal he took all the talent and didn't leave me with any,"" Andy Thompson said. Michael Jordan averaged 24.8 points per game as a junior in high school after failing to make the varsity at Laney High in Wilmington, N.C., as a sophomore. More gems like this, from throughout Jordan's basketball career, can be found at the Jordan-dedicated page created by my pals at Basketball Reference to supplement your viewing of ""The Last Dance."" One criticism that the Jordan-led Bulls have faced in legacy debates is that they were never confronted with a truly great opponent in their six trips to the N.B.A. finals over a span of eight years. Jordan, though, did vanquish five teammates from the original ""Dream Team,"" which dominated the 1992 Olympics, as he built his 6-0 finals record: Magic Johnson (1991), Clyde Drexler (1992), Charles Barkley (1993) and the duo of Karl Malone and John Stockton (1997 and 1998). Seattle in 1996 was Jordan's only finals opponent that placed no one on the Dream Team -- although I must say that the Gary Payton/Shawn Kemp duo was a personal favorite. On Aug. 20, 1994, Michael Jordan hit a home run for the Class AA Birmingham Barons. It was the third and final homer of Jordan's lone season as a minor-league outfielder -- nine days after Major League Baseball's 1994 season was brought to an abrupt halt by a player strike.","In this week's newsletter, Marc Stein explains how Jackson's legacy as a winning coach was tarnished — and how Michael Jordan's new documentary can help.",7251ac0e-5900-5694-bfb0-6d4a3e43138d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/25/sports/25JPnba-philjackson-print/21stein01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=22a3df315c55debb1fd63bce7f4c5d0a53d579f8801cc90cd130535bcc69ce67&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Phil Jackson and Michael Jordan won six N.B.A. championships together with the Chicago Bulls.,7251ac0e-5900-5694-bfb0-6d4a3e43138d,N24News/imgs/7251ac0e-5900-5694-bfb0-6d4a3e43138d.jpg,9
Theater,'The Height of the Storm' Is Heading to Broadway,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/theater/the-height-of-the-storm-broadway.html,"""The Height of the Storm,"" by the French playwright Florian Zeller, is headed for Broadway, the Manhattan Theater Club announced Wednesday.

The play, which ended a successful run in London last month, is moving to the Samuel J. Friedman Theater in September. It centers on a couple who, after 50 years of marriage, struggle to cope with change and uncertainty. The actors Jonathan Pryce and Eileen Atkins, who starred in the London production, will reprise their roles as husband and wife. Jonathan Kent (""Long Day's Journey Into Night"") will direct.

Mr. Zeller made his Broadway debut in 2016 with ""The Father,"" for which Frank Langella won a Tony Award for best actor. Another work of his, ""The Mother,"" starring Isabelle Huppert, is to begin performances Off Broadway at the Atlantic Theater Company on Feb. 20.

The world premiere of ""The New Englanders"" by Jeff Augustin (""Little Children Dream of God""), about a mixed-race family searching for happiness in a quiet New England town, will follow, in an Off Broadway run at City Center Stage II, also as part of Manhattan Theater Club's new season.","The play, by Florian Zeller, is slated for Manhattan Theater Club's 2019-20 season, along with works by Jeff Augustin and Qui Nguyen.",c94cfc15-e9d0-563c-9b69-052613ac6558,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/07/arts/07broadway-item/07broadway-item-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=244fc13d6d6a67a0c58f4e366853c7cd188d48ceda39cdc166e20eba66325019&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Florian Zeller, the writer of ""The Height of the Storm.""

Science,Why Some Say the Eclipse Is Best Experienced in a Crowd,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/science/why-some-say-the-eclipse-is-best-experienced-in-a-massive-crowd.html,"Why Some Say the Eclipse Is Best Experienced in a Crowd

Right about now, maybe you're looking at your bank account and reports of unprecedented traffic and wondering why you thought it was a good idea to experience the eclipse in the particular spot you chose. You felt original, planning to watch near a mountain of cars (Carhenge, near Alliance, Neb.) or along the moon's limb (Glendo, Wyo.). But then you saw that thousands of other people had the same idea. Some are warning of a ""zombie apocalypse,"" as hordes of befuddled sky-gazers strain the resources of towns more accustomed to hosting pancake breakfasts than managing Coachella-size gatherings. Don't worry. Here are four reasons human behavior researchers say that you made the right decision to experience the eclipse in a crowd -- even if the portable toilets overflow.

Why is it that excitement can feel so much more intense when we're in a group with others feeling the same emotion? Fergus Neville, a social psychologist at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, believes this results from seeing our own emotions reflected in the faces of others around us, which validates our own experience and amplifies the intensity of our feelings.

Using a variety of tools, including surveys and heart rate measures, he has tried to assess this magnification process. ""I think that you can have the experience with small groups, but that the more people you see in your group who are sharing your experience, then the stronger the validation effect and thus the stronger the experience,"" he said in an email. Perhaps this is worth keeping in mind the day before the eclipse, as you drive around trying to find a store that hasn't yet sold out of water.

Given the macho, aggressive reputation that some sports fans have, Dr. Neville said people are often surprised by that finding. What it hints at is something other researchers have found as well: Many of us who seem not to want to interact with strangers -- actually do. We just don't know how to make it happen in normal life. So why is it much easier to do in some crowds than others? The critical ingredient, researchers say, is a sense of shared social identity. That's something that is pretty much guaranteed in a field full of people in matching glasses, waiting for the moon to cover the sun-- regardless of whether you hang out in the same kinds of places normally.

This past weekend in Charlottesville was a tragic reminder of how group dynamics can go awry. But a crowd that gathers to protest something, researchers say, operates differently than a crowd that gathers to enjoy an experience. And in either case, more people doesn't necessarily translate into more danger. ""The fear of crowds flows from the idea that crowds are irrational and that they need to be controlled,"" said Clifford Stott, a social psychologist at Keele University in Britain. But a large body of research from the past decade, he said, has shown that ""people don't panic -- people self-regulate."" That's not to say that local officials are off the hook. Helping ensure that there's sufficient water and emergency services requires planning. It's also crucial that even when authorities feel like their resources are strained, they continue to remind themselves that people are there for something positive and capable of responding to thoughtful communication.","Human behavior researchers offer four reasons why it's worth experiencing totality in a large group, even if the toilets overflow.",e9abc22d-472d-5149-a57d-d0c0d40563d5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/15/science/15SCI-CROWDS1/15SCI-CROWDS1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=2e050e724ff833392848dd8053d100c7f98decc87e5ff9921e7375da7bf72d03&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Two key elements to an exceptional eclipse experience, according to social psychologists are eye protection and a crowd.

The Nazarios are refugees; their remnants have scattered around the world to survive. My Jewish mother fled Poland in 1933. My Christian father fled Syria two years earlier. They met and married in Argentina, whose right-wing dictatorship imprisoned and almost killed my sister. By giving us a home, the United States saved our lives. Would it do the same today? The Trump administration has barred those seeking refuge from our borders and turned our immigration courts into a joke. This is a betrayal of America's decades-long role as a world leader in refugee protection. It also breaks our own laws and treaty commitments, which say we will take people in, give them a fair court hearing and not return them to harm. But it is not a total historical anomaly. America has gone through spasms of nativism before. In 1939, Congress shelved a bill to take in 20,000 Jewish children, and the ocean liner St. Louis, which carried 937 Jewish refugees, was turned away from the docks; hundreds aboard were murdered in the Holocaust. Then, as now, many on both the right and the left have argued that the choice Americans face on immigration and asylum is between zero tolerance and opening the floodgates. But this is a false choice. We can have an immigration policy that is sane and humane.

One of the few survivors, Toby Levy, who is now 86 and lives in Brooklyn, told me that she saw a German soldier shoot a young girl. He picked the child up with one hand, she was so small; ""I will never forget that,"" Ms. Levy said. And with the other hand -- ""click"" -- he shot her in the head. In a nearby town where many of my family members lived, children were buried alive. My mother's aunt stayed on the family vineyard. She, her husband and their five children disappeared off the face of the earth. Her youngest, Asher Lemel Apsel, was just a few years old. My father's name was Mahafud, which means protected by God. He was born on a wheat and sheep farm in a Christian enclave of Syria called Mhardeh. Christians were slaughtered in Syria throughout the 20th century. My family feared for their lives whenever they traveled outside of Mhardeh, and they finally decided to leave the country when my father was a newborn. He and his parents settled in Santiago del Estero, in northern Argentina, which was hot and dry and reminded them of home. They took the name Nazario, thanks to an Argentine migration agent who told my great-uncle Asad Eben Naser Loush that no one would be able to pronounce his name. The agent wrote down ""Nazario"" instead -- a common surname in Italy, where many Argentines were from. When my father was a young man studying biochemistry, he met my mother on a bus in Buenos Aires. It was 1951, and he recited Pablo Neruda to her: ""I want to do with you what spring does with the cherry trees."" When he stopped riding that route, my mom systematically scouted out every biochemistry lab on the bus line, asking, ""Does Mahafud work here?"" until she found him and asked him out. When they married, my Jewish grandfather was furious. He said my mother was dead to him for marrying an Arab -- he even sat shiva for her -- until they gave birth to something he could no longer resist: his first grandsons, twins, no less.

In 1955, a military coup -- one of many -- shut down the university where my father worked. In 1959, he received a grant to continue his research at the University of Wisconsin. Soon after we arrived in the United States, I was born -- the first in my family to be born here. Tall and dark-skinned, my father longed for Argentina. He invited Latino friends to sit in a circle in front of our home and pass around a gourd filled with mate, an Argentine tea communally sipped from a silver straw. Argentines are obsessed with grilling meat, and true to form, my father barbecued whole goats in our backyard. On weekends, he took me along to the lab, where I watched him switch out test tubes in the centrifugal machines. He was trying to map the genes of microorganisms, work that he would eventually pursue as a professor at the University of Kansas Medical Center. I understand Americans' desire to say, ""Take care of our own first!"" In Los Angeles, where I live now, we have our own tent cities -- blocks upon blocks of homeless encampments. One in seven children in the United States is hungry. Empathy has been stretched to its limits. People aren't racist for fretting that Americans without high school diplomas may have to compete with immigrants for jobs in industries like construction. I understand those who fear rapid cultural change. We have to play straight with people: In the 2019 federal fiscal year, nearly a million migrants were apprehended at our southern border, a 12-year high. That's not nothing. A third of all Hondurans are planning to migrate, a recent survey showed. Wouldn't you? A new study by Doctors Without Borders found that more than two-thirds of migrants fleeing Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala had a family member murdered, kidnapped or disappeared. Despite their discomfort with the stream of asylum-seekers, Americans took to the streets in 2018 when they saw our government tearing babies out of the arms of Central American mothers. We don't do that, Americans said. That's not the kind of country we are. And yet these same Americans have been largely silent as our government tramples a half-century of refugee and asylum law.

The Trump administration has barred asylum-seekers from entering the United States to make their claim, as our law says they are entitled to do, instead forcing them to line up for months and await their turn at an official port of entry on the Mexican side of the border. Even when they get to the head of the line, they can be turned back: Since January 2019 we have sent more than 57,000 asylum applicants, including at least 16,000 children, back into Mexico's borderlands to wait until their court date. It's dead winter, and their only shelter is often a few taped-together trash bags. They are at the mercy of cartels and kidnappers, who see them as easy prey. A lawyer in Laredo, Texas, I recently spoke to astounded me by disclosing that more than half of the migrants she has interviewed have had someone in their family kidnapped, extorted or assaulted by narco cartels while waiting just across the border in Nuevo Laredo, a place so dangerous the U.S. State Department compares it to Syria, North Korea or Yemen. One asylum officer who resigned in protest told The Los Angeles Times that we are ""literally sending people back to be raped and killed."" When my father was 42, he died of a heart attack. Like many migrants, my mother longed for home, so in 1974, when I was 14 years old, she uprooted her four children and left Kansas for Argentina. My mother had terrible timing: The military was just about to take power and kill or disappear an estimated 30,000 people. I would tremble whenever I saw a Ford Falcon cruise down the street; it was the vehicle of choice for undercover military officers. They would pluck people up -- professors, teachers, journalists, students -- anyone advocating a more just society. They beat you, administered electric shock to your genitals. They put your head in a bucket of urine and feces until you were drowning. They drugged people with the anesthetic Ketalar and every Wednesday shoved them off airplanes into the ocean. They kept hundreds of pregnant women long enough for them to give birth, handed the babies to childless couples in the military, then killed the mothers.

Owning certain books -- ""Alice in Wonderland,"" Freud -- could get you in trouble. I helped my mother put all of the family's books into a big pile in the backyard. We set it on fire. One day my mother and I were walking down the street when I saw a pool of blood on the ground. ""Two journalists were murdered here,"" my mother told me. I decided, staring at that pool of blood, to become a journalist. Among the American values I am most proud of are freedom, the rule of law and the right to dissent. Right now, the rule of law is being quietly massacred in the name of keeping asylum-seekers out -- a policy most Americans don't even agree with. (A Gallup poll last year showed that 57 percent of Americans support taking in Central American refugees, and 76 percent, the highest since Gallup first asked in 2001, see immigration as good for the United States.) President Trump said he wanted a rigged asylum system, and that's what he's given us. In June he tweeted, ""When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came."" He proclaimed from the Oval Office, ""To be honest with you, you have to get rid of judges.""

The Trump administration is expanding a program in El Paso (where the denial rate is already 97 percent) in which migrants' cases are decided within 10 days. Ten days to find a lawyer, request documents from officials in another country and line up expert witnesses. It's a sham. After a year and a half of life under Argentina's generals, my mother decided to get us out. We went back to the United States just a few months before the military officially took control of the government on March 24, 1976. But my sister was a senior in high school; she stayed behind to finish the year. One night in May the phone at our house in Kansas rang with a call from one of my aunts. Soldiers had broken down the door to our Buenos Aires condo and trashed the place. My sister was missing -- she had been disappeared. My sister, who now practices medicine in the Midwest, was hesitant to be identified in this article. She was afraid that her friends, colleagues and patients here in the United States would judge her for what she went through -- that they wouldn't be able to comprehend that in Argentina at that time, you could be imprisoned and killed despite being entirely innocent. The aunt in Buenos Aires was too afraid to go to the police for fear they might snatch her, too. She called my father's sister Sofia in northern Argentina, who called a cousin whose son worked in Argentina's secret services. ""What can you do?"" she begged. She learned that my sister was alive and being held at the central police station. Sofia had the family gather any disposable cash and all of their gold bracelets, in case they were needed for bribes, and she flew to Buenos Aires. She waited several tense hours in the station before someone acknowledged that my sister was there. But she was transferred, and then transferred again. A few weeks later, my sister's boyfriend, Javier Gustavo Grebel, was picked up while leafleting against the military outside a school. Those with clearly Jewish names, like his, fared worse than other prisoners. A now-declassified telegram from the United States Embassy titled ""Violence Against Argentine Jews"" says anti-Semitic military commanders called people ""Jew dog"" during torture sessions. Some believed that simply being Jewish was enough to get you arrested. We later heard from another prisoner that Javier's torturers broke all the bones in his face. Did he end up in the military's ""chupaderos,"" its concentration camps? To this day, his family has no idea what happened to him.

While all this was going on, I was acutely aware that I was the only natural-born American citizen in my family. So at 14 I lobbied my congressional leaders in Kansas to save my sister. This led to Secretary of State Henry Kissinger sending a telegram to Argentina's dictator, Gen. Jorge Rafael Videla, asking why my sister was being held without charge. (Mr. Kissinger is, of course, the same diplomat who appeared to give the new regime a green light for human rights abuses when he told Argentina's foreign minister in June 1976, ""We understand you must establish authority,"" and, ""If there are things that have to be done, you should do them quickly."") On the night of Sept. 21, 1976, my sister was released. She had been imprisoned for five months. What was done to her in that time? It was so painful for her to relive the experience that, although we're very close, we didn't speak of it for decades. Now I know: My sister was raped, forced to stand in stress positions, blindfolded, and held in a damp, cold cell. She went days without food or sleep. The night she was released, there was a thick frost in the air. Often, prisoners were shot moments after being let go. Walking away from the prison, she told me, she expected to feel a bullet at any minute. The American government generally does not allow innocent people to be imprisoned, raped and shot in the back. These are the kinds of experiences refugees who come here seeking safety are fleeing. We can have a pragmatic, compassionate refugee policy. We don't have to choose between letting everyone in and no one in. Conservatives may not like this, but we have to let through people who say they are afraid. Allow applicants into the United States and monitor them until their court hearings (which nine in 10 do show up for). Don't lock them up, as we are doing with some 60,000 immigrants a night, in places where they get inadequate medical care. At least seven migrant children have died in immigration custody since 2018. This simply didn't happen before. Our government is killing children through neglect. Make the court process fair; make it fitting of our country. Take our increasingly politicized immigration courts out of the Department of Justice and make them independent. Make sure that immigrant children have a government-funded lawyer, since most cannot afford representation, which basically guarantees they will lose. From October 2017 to June 2018, 70 babies went to court alone.

Liberals might not like this, but we also have to deport migrants who lose their cases. President Trump refers to asylum as a ""loophole"" in our system. That's bogus. Yet there is another loophole that must be addressed: A vast majority of those who lose their asylum cases don't leave the country. They stay and blend into the woodwork. This rightfully riles Americans who believe these unsuccessful asylum-seekers are thumbing their noses at our legal process. Require Immigration and Customs Enforcement to focus on deporting people who have just lost their asylum cases, not the parent who has been here 30 years. Democrats need to get woke and realize that any immigration reform plan has to show they believe in the rule of law. I've lived in a country with no laws. Democrats don't want that. We cannot take in everyone, so we need to prioritize those fleeing harm. Stop talking about idiotic things like open borders. Or liberals will keep losing on this issue. There's something ready-made for Americans who care about this travesty to lobby for: the Refugee Protection Act, introduced in Congress in November. It would require the United States to take in far more refugees, including at least 100,000 a year from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras alone. It would prevent the government from forcing people to apply for asylum in other countries they passed through on the way here, and prohibit ports of entry from pleading overcrowding as an excuse to turn people away. It would exempt migrants from criminal prosecution for crossing without documents, and allow asylum-seekers to be released temporarily in the United States if they pose no risk to public safety. It would reverse a Trump administration decision that bars people fleeing domestic or gang violence from obtaining asylum. And it would require our government to appoint lawyers for migrant children. Americans need to stop whining and ride Congress to pass this bill. Every one of my fellow Jews in this country should have their hair on fire over this -- especially folks like Jared Kushner, whose Polish family, like mine, found safety here. I often get asked: What part of ""illegal"" don't you understand? Well, our laws say we have to help people who are running for their lives.

Art & Design,The Overlooked History of Women at Work,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/arts/design/womens-work-grolier-club.html,"Martha Maxwell stood only 4 feet 11 inches tall. But in the annals of natural history, she was a giant of a kind. After moving West during the gold rush, she became perhaps the first female naturalist to hunt, skin and stuff her own specimens, which she displayed in her own museum. She was perhaps also the first naturalist, period, to display animals in the kind of lifelike tableaus now familiar at institutions everywhere. Not that Maxwell's work wasn't greeted with condescension, even disbelief. One stereographic image, taken at her museum, shows her standing quietly in the middle of a diorama, behind a pronghorn, with the caption ""Mrs. Maxwell and Her Pets."" And when she put her work on view at the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, where she represented Colorado, some visitors were so doubtful that she had done it all herself that a sign was added, reading simply ""Woman's Work.""

""The world demands proof of woman's capabilities,"" Maxwell once said, when asked how her handiwork related to the treatises for women's equality being published at the time. ""Without it words are useless."" Maxwell died in poverty a few years after the exhibition. But now, she is among the women being celebrated in ""Five Hundred Years of Women's Work,"" an exhibition at the Grolier Club in Manhattan documenting the long and sometimes hidden history of women making an independent living.

The exhibition, which runs until Feb. 8, is drawn from the collection of Lisa Unger Baskin, which is now owned by Duke University. The nearly 200 items on view include books, letters, photographs and printed matter of all kinds, along with surprises like a pink early-20th-century birth control sponge (or a ""sanitary health sponge,"" as its tin puts it). The materials show women working as scientists, artists, writers, activists, printers, architects, midwives, undertakers and makers and sellers of all things, from books and violins to patent medicines and condoms.

""I'm interested in how women managed to survive and keep themselves,"" Ms. Baskin said during a tour of the exhibition, which she curated with Naomi L. Nelson, the director of Duke's Rubenstein Library, and Lauren Reno, the library's head of rare materials cataloging. The phrase ""women's work"" may conjure up domesticity (if not drudgery), or ""women's professions"" like teaching or nursing. ""But there is an enormous breadth of vocations women have been part of,"" Ms. Baskin said. ""Women have been working people, always."" Assembling the collection, which includes some 16,000 items, has been a nearly 50-year endeavor for Ms. Baskin. When she began, women's history as an academic discipline was just getting started. In the (still) heavily male and white rare book world, women's material -- and women collectors -- were marginalized.

Ms. Baskin's first big ""score,"" she said, came at a flea market in Madison Square Garden. ""I asked one dealer, 'Do you have anything relating to women?'"" she recalled. He handed her a box of photographs. It turned out to be preparatory material for Adelaide Johnson's sculpture of Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott, which had been commissioned for display in the Rotunda of the United States Capitol in 1920, after the 19th Amendment was ratified, but relegated to the basement after a single day. (It was moved back to the Rotunda in 1997.)

The women's suffrage movement -- the exhibition includes two extensive cases dedicated to the British and American campaigns -- was an early anchor. From there, Ms. Baskin spiraled backward and outward, assembling a kaleidoscopic record of women both arguing for their rights, and simply going about their business. Among the oldest items on view is one of the first books printed by women, a 1478 history of Rome's emperors and popes. (It's shown open to a passage about Pope Joan, a mythical female pontiff.) The most recent are letters by the anarchist Emma Goldman, displayed, in a slyly pointed nod to the present, next to Goldman's 1919 pamphlet against deportation. Virginia Woolf's writing desk, a star of the collection, stayed behind at Duke. But some marquee female writers are represented at the Grolier.

There's a piece of framed embroidery by Charlotte Bronte, displayed with a Bronte letter describing her efforts to find work as a governess. There's also the manuscript for Harriet Beecher Stowe's blurb for ""The Narrative of Sojourner Truth,"" as well as a 1773 first edition of Phillis Wheatley -- the first African-American to publish a book of poetry, and perhaps the first American woman to try to earn a living by writing. That book's famous frontispiece, showing Wheatley putting quill pen to paper, finds an echo across the gallery, in a copy of ""Prejudice Unveiled,"" a 1907 poetry collection by Lizelia Augusta Jenkins Moorer. The author photograph may be the first image of an African-American woman with a typewriter, a label reads. (The show also includes a copy of the first autobiography by a black woman in Britain: the rollicking 1857 account by Mary Seacole, a Jamaican-born nurse who, among many other things, served in the Crimean War.)","A Grolier Club exhibition explores 500 years of women as scientists, midwives, writers, activists, undertakers and more.",d871767f-eb45-5540-a9ec-593675e9dd0a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/17/arts/17womens-work1/17womens-work1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c2665f8eb7b19d3487d3907c4da5223f6a80c115c4ca9078b254c212bc953992&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The naturalist Martha Maxwell, perhaps the first female naturalist to shoot and prepare her own specimens, shown in one of her signature lifelike tableaus around 1879.",d871767f-eb45-5540-a9ec-593675e9dd0a,N24News/imgs/d871767f-eb45-5540-a9ec-593675e9dd0a.jpg,14
Technology,Competing With the Giants in Race to Build Self-Driving Cars,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/technology/self-driving-cars-aurora.html,"PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Before the car can drive without a human, one must first get behind the wheel. As the driver at this company accelerates, stops and turns on local streets, sensors on the car record what he sees and track how he responds. Then a team of engineers builds software that can learn how to behave from that data. The software is installed in the car, and it can drive on its own. In the end, the car mimics choices made by the human driver. This is how things work at Aurora Innovation, a start-up founded by three veterans of autonomous vehicle research, including Chris Urmson, who previously led the self-driving car project at Google.

These algorithms can learn tasks on their own by analyzing vast amounts of data. ""It used to be that a real smart Ph.D. sat in a cube for six months, and they would hand-code a detector"" that spotted objects on the road, Mr. Urmson said during a recent interview at Aurora's offices. ""Now, you gather the right kind of data and feed it to an algorithm, and a day later, you have something that works as well as that six months of work from the Ph.D.""

The Google self-driving car project first used the technique to detect pedestrians. Since then, it has applied the same method to many other parts of the car, including systems that predict what will happen on the road and plan a route forward. Now, the industry as a whole is moving in the same direction. But this shift raises questions. It is still unclear how regulators and lawyers -- not to mention the general public -- will view these methods. Because neural networks learn from such large amounts of data, relying on hours or even days of calculations, they operate in ways that their human designers cannot necessarily anticipate or understand. There is no means of determining exactly why a machine reaches a particular decision. ""This is a big transition,"" said Noah Goodall, who explores regulatory and legal issues surrounding autonomous cars at the Virginia Transportation Research Council, an arm of the State Department of Transportation. ""If you start using neural networks to control how a car moves and then it crashes, how do you explain why it crashed and why it won't happen again?""

The seeds for this work were planted in 2012. Working with two other researchers at the University of Toronto, a graduate student named Alex Krizhevsky built a neural network that could recognize photos of everyday objects like flowers, dogs and cars. By analyzing thousands of flower photos, it could learn to recognize a flower in a matter of days. And it performed better than any system coded by hand. Soon, Mr. Krizhevsky and his collaborators moved to Google, and over the next few years, Google and its internet rivals broke new ground in artificial intelligence, using these concepts to identify objects in photos and to recognize commands spoken into smartphones, translate between languages and respond to internet search queries.

Over the holiday break at the end of 2013, another Google researcher, Anelia Angelova, asked for Mr. Krizhevsky's help on the Google car project. Neither of them officially worked on the project. They were part of a separate A.I. lab called Google Brain. But they saw an opportunity. Rather than trying to define for a computer what a pedestrian looked like, they created an algorithm that could allow a computer to learn what a pedestrian looked like. By analyzing thousands of street photos, their system could begin to identify the visual patterns that define a pedestrian, like the curve of a head or the bend of a leg. The method was so effective that Google began applying the technique to other parts of the project, including prediction and planning. ""It was a big turning point,"" said Dmitri Dolgov, who was part of Google's original self-driving car team and is now chief technology officer at Waymo, the new company that oversees the project. ""2013 was pretty magical."" Mr. Urmson described this shift in much the same way. He believes the continued progress of these and other machine learning methods will be essential to building cars that can match and even exceed the behavior of human drivers.

Mirroring the work at Waymo, Aurora is building algorithms that can recognize objects on the road and anticipate and react to what other vehicles and pedestrians will do next. As Mr. Urmson explained, the software can learn what happens when a driver turns the vehicle in a particular direction at a particular speed on a particular type of road. Learning from human drivers in this way is an evolution of an old idea. In the early 1990s, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University built a car that learned relatively simple behavior. Last year, a team of researchers at Nvidia, the computer chip maker, published a paper showing how modern hardware can extend the idea to more complex behavior. But many researchers question whether carmakers can completely understand why neural networks make particular decisions and rule out unexpected behavior.

Like Waymo, Toyota and others, Aurora says that its approach is more controlled than it might seem. The company layers cars with backup systems, so that if one system fails, another can offer a safety net. And rather than driving the car using a single neural network that learns all behavior from one vast pool of data -- the method demonstrated by Nvidia -- they break the task into smaller pieces. One system detects traffic lights, for example. Another predicts what will happen next on the road in a particular kind of situation. A third chooses a response. And so on. The company can train and test and retrain each piece. ""How do you get confidence that something works?"" asked Drew Bagnell, a machine learning specialist who helped found Aurora after leaving the self-driving car program at Uber. ""You test it."" Mr. Goodall, the Virginia Department of Transportation researcher, said car designers must reassure both regulators and the public that these methods are reliable. ""The onus is on them,"" he said.","Aurora, a start-up founded by the former head of Google's self-driving project, will feed its technology into car giants Volkswagen and Hyundai.",e59e78e2-3136-5d59-9ecf-ad49bbb26810,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/05/business/05WHEELS1/05WHEELS-6-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=5acb61bd1a2eae481829242c19b402486e53b6bf64653744a3586ecca593a4a7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sterling Anderson, left, and Chris Urmson at Aurora Innovation, a start-up founded by three veterans of autonomous vehicle research, including Mr. Urmson.",e59e78e2-3136-5d59-9ecf-ad49bbb26810,N24News/imgs/e59e78e2-3136-5d59-9ecf-ad49bbb26810.jpg,20
Technology,Facebook Tried to Rein In Fake Ads. It Fell Short in a California Race.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/03/technology/california-congressional-race-facebook-election-interference.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Regina Bateson had just finished an Easter egg hunt with her children on April 1 when her phone started buzzing. Take a look at Facebook, messages from her friends and colleagues urged. Ms. Bateson, a Democrat running for Congress in the California primary on Tuesday, quickly opened up the social network. There, she saw what appeared to be a news article that painted her as underhandedly trying to torpedo the campaign of a rival Democratic candidate. When Ms. Bateson clicked through the article, she was directed to a Facebook page run by Sierra Nevada Revolution, a local progressive group she had clashed with in the past. The article was not a news story, she found, but a political ad paid for by Sierra Nevada Revolution. And while Facebook rolled out new rules on April 6 mandating that campaign ads be clearly labeled and say who had purchased them, Sierra Nevada Revolution's ad about Ms. Bateson continued to be targeted to local voters throughout that month without any of those disclosures.

Ms. Bateson's experience underscores Facebook's difficulties as the Silicon Valley company aims to prevent manipulation of its ad system in elections, especially as the midterms loom this November. While the company has introduced several measures to improve the transparency of political ads on its platform, some groups and individuals appear to be finding ways to flout the new restrictions -- and Facebook has not been able to catch them. That raises questions about whether there are other gaps. Apart from improving transparency of political ads, Facebook has announced that it will not run a campaign ad in the United States unless it verifies the advertiser through a Social Security number, that it will keep a public archive of all political ads so they are easily searchable and that it has added a ""paid for"" label atop campaign ads so users can get more information. Paul Smith, the administrator of Sierra Nevada Revolution's Facebook page, said that despite Facebook's efforts, he was able to place other political ads -- some about Ms. Bateson and some about other issues -- without labeling them. He didn't say how many. There is another potential loophole in Facebook's rules. It appears that one person can go through the verification process and then give the account to someone else. Mr. Smith, for instance, said that while Facebook had authenticated him as a political advertiser, he later handed over control of Sierra Nevada Revolution's account to others. That meant others could have used his Facebook verification to post political ads without the social network's knowing it was not him.

""They don't know we are five people running it, or however many,"" Mr. Smith said in a phone interview. ""It's also not consistent. Occasionally, we slip a political ad by Facebook because it's not flagged."" Rob Leathern, Facebook's director of product management, said he was ""grateful"" that The New York Times had brought the actions of Sierra Nevada Revolution to the company's attention. ""We are looking into it because it's against our policies to share passwords or give someone else access to a person's Facebook account,"" he said, adding, ""We use signals such as two-factor authentication to detect and prevent this type of abuse, but steps like these won't stop every attempt to game the system."" Facebook is being driven by its failure in the 2016 American presidential election to stop Russian agents from using the platform to spread divisive messages to voters. In the aftermath, the company announced changes, including working with independent fact-checkers and starting a news literacy campaign to help people spot disinformation. Facebook also banned political ads from foreign groups in some elections, including Ireland's recent abortion referendum.

""We believe the process we put in place is a solid step, but we also know that initially there will be instances where we don't catch ads that should have been labeled and the authorization process wasn't completed by the person placing the ad,"" Mr. Leathern said in the call. The Fourth District race has received national attention because four Democrats are running to oust Representative Tom McClintock, a five-term Republican. Ms. Bateson's main rival is Jessica Morse, who previously worked for the State Department and other agencies. Both are campaigning for office for the first time. Mr. McClintock has said he believes that his seat is safe. To run, Ms. Bateson, who grew up in Roseville, Calif., took a leave of absence last year from her job as a political-science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She moved from Boston back to her hometown, which is just outside Sacramento, with her husband, Vivek Krishnamurthy, who is a lawyer, and their three children. Ms. Bateson is running on a platform that includes protection of the Affordable Care Act.

Sierra Nevada Revolution, which is facing a complaint to the Federal Election Commission over its failure to register as a political organization, clashed with Ms. Bateson starting in March when the group endorsed Ms. Morse. It attacked Ms. Bateson for having challenged Ms. Morse's credentials this year. The group often posted its criticism of Ms. Bateson on Facebook. Mr. Smith said he was in control of the account when it posted its first ad blasting her, adding that he spent more than $3,000 of his own money on that ad and others. That first ad, which Facebook did not designate as a political ad, was titled, ""Lose by any means necessary."" It accused Ms. Bateson of running a ""scorched earth campaign"" and helping the Republican candidate by turning on her fellow Democrats.","Measures to prevent election interference remain spotty, as shown in the Fourth Congressional District's Democratic primary.",8929d3f9-d649-5250-9fe2-ad076b87611d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/04/business/04fbcampaign-1/04fbcampaign-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=4666df3f4cd6577ea60c74929e6a1a3182bda829e73a824df927836a12f5fbde&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Regina Bateson, a Democrat running for Congress in the California primary on Tuesday, at a fund-raising party in Auburn, Calif.",8929d3f9-d649-5250-9fe2-ad076b87611d,N24News/imgs/8929d3f9-d649-5250-9fe2-ad076b87611d.jpg,20
Music,"Andre Harrell, Executive Who Bridged Hip-Hop and R&B, Dies at 59",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/arts/music/andre-harrell-dead.html,"Andre Harrell, an innovative music executive who in the late 1980s founded Uptown Records, a crucial bridge between the worlds of hip-hop and R&B, and who gave the first career break to Sean Combs, today one of hip-hop's signature moguls and global ambassadors, died on Thursday night at his home in West Hollywood, Calif. He was 59. His ex-wife, Wendy Credle, said that the cause was heart failure and that Mr. Harrell had had heart problems for some time. Hip-hop was growing prodigiously in the early to mid-1980s, and Mr. Harrell was at the center of it as a rapper and an executive. But his vision for the music wasn't always in line with his peers' -- he preferred a splash of sophistication and an approach that would speak to older and younger generations alike. When he founded Uptown Records in 1986, he created a home for artists who melded hip-hop swagger with traditional R&B smoothness, who had both sleek surfaces and hard edges. For almost a decade it was one of the most musically important and financially successful record labels in the country, building the careers of Mary J. Blige, Jodeci, Al B. Sure!, Guy and many more.

Andre O'Neal Harrell was born in the Bronx on Sep. 26, 1960. His father, Bernie, worked at the Hunts Point produce market in the Bronx; his mother, Hattie, was a nurse's aide. He graduated from Charles Evans Hughes High School in 1978 and attended both Baruch College and Lehman College in New York City. Despite his humble beginnings, Mr. Harrell believed he was destined for success. ""I grew up thinking wonderful things could happen,"" he told Vanity Fair in 1993. ""I always believed I'd have a wonderful life."" Before he had even graduated from high school, Mr. Harrell had his first big break in the music business -- as a rapper, Dr. Jeckyll, half of the duo Dr. Jeckyll & Mr. Hyde with his high school friend Alonzo Brown. They released a handful of successful singles in the early 1980s, most notably ""Genius Rap"" in 1981 and ""A.M./P.M."" in 1984. The duo, who stood out from their contemporaries by performing in suit and tie, released one album, ""The Champagne of Rap,"" in 1985.

After his rap duo disbanded, Mr. Harrell went to work for Rush Management, run by Russell Simmons, who was also the head of the titanic rap label Def Jam. Mr. Harrell ascended to vice president and general manager -- working with artists like Run-DMC, LL Cool J and Whodini -- before setting out on his own to found Uptown Records. Mr. Harrell understood his target audience intimately. ""I'm promoting the whole spectrum of black lifestyles, from the teenage street hip-hop lifestyle to an adult, upwardly mobile black lifestyle,"" he told Upscale magazine. This was a fertile time in hip-hop's development, and the moment when R&B began to reckon with its insurgent younger sibling. Uptown became a magnet for artists who limned the borders between the two: Guy, an R&B trio that in the hands of Teddy Riley helped pioneer the brash sound known as New Jack Swing; Al. B. Sure!, a charismatic and preternaturally smooth R&B singer; Heavy D & the Boyz, a genial and approachable hip-hop outfit; Father MC, a loverman rapper. ""I don't try to recreate black artists,"" Mr. Harrell told The New York Times in 1992. ""I reflect the image an artist has already created."" Uptown found fast success, beginning a partnership with a major label, MCA, in 1988. By the dawn of the 1990s, Uptown was one of the most reliable hitmakers in the music industry. And it went on to introduce two of the most essential R&B acts of the 1990s and beyond: the four-man vocal outfit Jodeci, which blended raw vigor with church-trained passion; and Mary J. Blige, who perfected callused heartbreak and would become one of soul music's biggest stars. ""I was all over the country, all over the world,"" Mr. Harrell told Vanity Fair of those years. ""I was 28 years old. The dough was flowing. I bought a house. Bought a BMW. Two. Was happy. It was the beginning of the game. I was crazy happy.""

To help stay current, Mr. Harrell hired Sean Combs as an intern in the early 1990s, after being introduced to him by Heavy D. Mr. Combs -- later known as Puff Daddy and Diddy -- attended Howard University in Washington and commuted to New York for his internship. ""I told him I'd wash cars, quit school -- anything -- a priceless chance to be in your presence,"" Mr. Combs told The Times in 2005. Mr. Combs quickly became indispensable and began doing A & R, working with Ms. Blige and Jodeci and helping to infuse them with hip-hop credibility.

But the power dynamic between Mr. Harrell and Mr. Combs was shifting, and Mr. Harrell fired Mr. Combs in 1993. Mr. Combs showed up on Mr. Harrell's doorstep to plead his case, but Mr. Harrell didn't budge. ""I guess Andre didn't want two kings in the castle,"" Mr. Combs told The Times. ""I had obtained some success, some notoriety, and I didn't realize it wasn't my house."" Shortly thereafter, Mr. Combs founded Bad Boy Records, which would become one of the most important labels in rap history and -- given how he extended the music's reach -- in pop history, too. In 1992, Mr. Harrell signed a $50 million deal with MCA for a new company, Uptown Entertainment, which spanned music, film and television. ""My goal is to bring real black America -- just as it is, not watered down -- to people everywhere through music, through films, through everything we do,"" he told The Los Angeles Times.","He founded the influential label Uptown Records and gave a first break to Sean Combs, who would go on to become one of hip-hop's signature moguls.",871d01a4-9efc-5332-840d-e49977038055,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/11/arts/11harrell/09harrell-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=571115ca0af349c2afe554358fb8128f9319c7ecccd21516b8e93ed6d2787200&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The music executive Andre Harrell in an undated photo.

Train Hotel, a Montreal-based train company, is celebrating the Montreal International Jazz Festival, running from June 25 to July 6, by offering round-trip rides between Penn Station in New York City and Central Station in Montreal in a Jazz Railcar. The car, attached to an Amtrak train, can accommodate 36 passengers and features three hours of jazz entertainment during parts of the 11-hour trip by Mari Sild, a pianist-singer from Montreal, and Marie Michele, a singer with Oh La La!, a New York City jazz band. Three multi-course meals prepared by the train's chef are included in the cost, and the picturesque scenery along the way includes the Hudson River Valley and Lake Champlain. The company ran three of the same round-trips on the jazz car during the Easter season, but it's the first time it is doing so for the festival. $240 one-way and $320 round-trip.

On July 1, Belmond Hotel Cipriani in Venice and Pera Palace Hotel Jumeirah in Istanbul along with the train Venice-Simplon-Orient-Express will collaborate for a dinner to mark 125 years since the birth of the author Agatha Christie. The head chefs of each entity are creating a buffet of several dozen Turkish, Italian and French dishes at the Venice property (formerly branded as Orient-Express) that will be served around its swimming pool. The famous novelist has a connection to both the cities and the train: She wrote her novel ""Murder on the Orient Express"" at Pera Palace after arriving in Istanbul on the Simplon-Orient-Express from Venice, and her well-known character, detective Hercule Poirot, experienced the ride in the book. The price is 130 euros (about $140) and includes alcoholic drinks and entertainment, including an orchestra performance and a water show. Reservations can be made by email (f&b.cip@belmond.com) or phone (39-041-240-8517). 



OneHope Wine, the Napa Valley-based label that donates half the profits from every bottle sold to charity and produces its vintages in collaboration with the well-known winemaker Rob Mondavi Jr., has created two wines for domestic Virgin America flights. Available in six-ounce bottles for $8.25, they are a 2013 chardonnay and a 2013 cabernet sauvignon. The airline is donating 50 percent of the profits from sales of these vintages to the American Heart Association, and according to the OneHope co-founder and chief executive Jake Kloberdanz, the partnership with Virgin made sense because both companies attract millennials interested in being involved in charitable activities. ""We share a similar consumer base so we were happy to come up with wines for them which drink well at a high altitude,"" he said.","What you need to know if you're on a trip or planning one soon, including live music on a train to the Montreal International Jazz Festival and an Agatha Christie celebration in Istanbul.",933a4724-ffc5-5035-a99c-f2ee6a82955d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/25/travel/25intransitphoto-train/25intransitphoto-train-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=4230b97211056f1b766f687d47c78d7928a411ca803b3add140b2255f8d61221&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Mari Sild at the keyboard and Sophie Lapierre singing on the Jazz Railcar.,933a4724-ffc5-5035-a99c-f2ee6a82955d,N24News/imgs/933a4724-ffc5-5035-a99c-f2ee6a82955d.jpg,4
Television,'Game of Thrones': 9 Questions for the Final Season,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/arts/television/game-of-thrones-season-8-questions.html,"W ill Jon and Dany have their happily ever after? Don't count on it. In the Season 8 premiere the new couple, last seen entwined in their love boat, arrives at Winterfell (as seen in the trailer). And who else is at Winterfell? Bran, who knows Jon is Dany's nephew, and Samwell Tarly, who knows that this gives Jon a better claim on the Iron Throne than Dany. It's enough to complicate any new romance.

Another thing about Sam: His best friend Jon is now dating the same woman who torched his father and brother last season. So that should be fun. [Want exclusive ""Game of Thrones"" interviews and news, as well as the internet's best articles on that week's episode? Sign up for our Season 8 newsletter here.]

Dany tells everyone that she is not like her father, the Mad King. But she's largely defined by her messianic streak, a quality that in its most extreme form can -- much like Targaryens, we're repeatedly reminded -- go either way. And while she has shown plenty of compassion (freeing slaves, forgiving Jorah), she responds to slights with often shocking cruelty (crucifying masters in Meereen, locking her handmaiden Doreah in the vault, torching the Tarlys). So considering the revelations awaiting her in Winterfell, this thing could be a powder keg.

Which big battle will happen first? The one for the Iron Throne or the one for the fate of humanity? Now that the Night King and friends have breached the Wall, they would seem to be the more pressing concern. Jon, at least, is focused on the White Walkers and seems to have convinced Dany's camp and Sansa to go along with this plan. Jaime seems to be on board, too. Also, all we've heard in the run-up to the final season is about the 55 nights of shooting and the unprecedented scale of the White Walker clash, and according to HBO, the longest episode of the season is actually the third one. (One hour, 22 minutes!) So maybe Night King first, then Cersei. Of course, a persistent theory has the Night King being the one to win the whole thing, which is technically possible but seems too cynical for a story that, while dark and full of terrors, seems to be generally about moving into the light.

If a living fire dragon and a zombie ice dragon blast each other, who wins? I believe it was the maester Cleatus the Melancholy who first postulated in ""Ice Magick and Dragon Fyre"" that the heat generated by an adult dragon is honestly who in the seven hells could possibly know? The clash should be fun to watch, at any rate, until dragons start dying (or re-dying, in Viserion's case). And then it will be sad, because the beasts didn't ask to be born into this cruel and stupid world.

Will anyone actually win the Game of Thrones? It's right there in the title: This show is about a pan-global contest to win ultimate power. But is it really though? Hasn't everything we've learned over the past seven seasons -- as this fevered pursuit has inspired all manner of butchery and abuse, and destroyed families and relationships, and empowered sadists, and turned the most magnificent creatures in the land into nuclear weapons and led at least one formerly decent man to literally burn his daughter alive (I'll never forgive you HBO) -- suggested that this contest is, in fact, irredeemably toxic? Vegas will give you odds on the various contenders (we had our own fun with this). But are we really supposed to root for one of this story's heroes to eventually sit upon the symbol of all that is terrible? Given this show's defining knack for upending expectations, the long-promised battle for control of the kingdom seems sure to veer from the usual ""good guys meet bad guys, blow stuff up, suffer losses but prevail in the end"" script. Wouldn't the ultimate swerve for ""Game of Thrones"" be to blow up the throne itself? Maybe. Or maybe Jon and Dany will be the beloved king and queen, and Tyrion, Jaime and Arya will all get flowers and medals as in the ends of ""Star Wars"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" or any number of more conventional fantasy tales. Either way, game on.","When winter finally comes to the HBO epic with one last batch of episodes, it has a lot to answer for.",f0f3416d-0f70-507f-a13a-11f4548852e4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/07/arts/07got-plot-1/07got-plot-1-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=e58e38b57e7924d51eef62dca8392226519fde5776a04db502ba8c019c44eab9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington as Daenerys Targaryen and Jon Snow.,f0f3416d-0f70-507f-a13a-11f4548852e4,N24News/imgs/f0f3416d-0f70-507f-a13a-11f4548852e4.jpg,3
Technology,Former Baltimore County Schools Leader Charged With Perjury,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/technology/baltimore-schools-perjury.html,"Baltimore County's schools had embarked on an ambitious technology makeover, committing more than $200 million to providing laptops for students and millions more on no-bid contracts for learning apps. The Times found that tech industry-funded groups or vendors paid for flights to conferences, as well as hotels and dinners, for school officials.

Mr. Dance actively negotiated the terms of a $875,000 no-bid contract between his school district and Supes Academy, a school leadership training service, while he worked for Supes and a related company called Synesi, according to the indictment. Mr. Dance also made false statements on financial disclosure documents, the indictment said, to conceal about $90,000 in earnings from those companies.

The prosecutor also said that Mr. Dance concealed about $12,000 in payments he received through his consulting work in 2015, including $4,600 from an organization called the Education Research and Development Institute -- ERDI for short -- that pays superintendents to attend meetings with educational tech companies.

As part of its services, ERDI has in the past charged companies $13,000 to facilitate a meeting with five superintendents or other school leaders to discuss products, according to documents obtained by The Times. After Mr. Dance participated in confidential meetings with two of his district's tech vendors at an ERDI conference last year, the district extended both companies' contracts.

Officials in Maryland and Ohio have begun looking superintendents' relationships with ERDI.

Andrew Jay Graham, a lawyer representing Mr. Dance, declined to comment on the case. Mr. Dance faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison for each of the four counts against him, according to the indictment.","Shaun Dallas Dance, the district's former superintendent, has been at the center of questions about the district's ties with educational technology companies.",07d5d0c3-5fb7-56b1-a1c2-43d7c5c03851,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/24/business/24SUPER1/24SUPER1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=cd500ccca6d3e426388bf648e9762dcf390286c0e7dc342640c0ab75527ab18c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Shaun Dallas Dance, a former superintendent of the Baltimore County Public Schools, is accused of making false statements on his financial disclosure forms.",07d5d0c3-5fb7-56b1-a1c2-43d7c5c03851,N24News/imgs/07d5d0c3-5fb7-56b1-a1c2-43d7c5c03851.jpg,20

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.

Good morning, readers! It was an interesting week in the tech world. Let's get to the news.

One thread in the yearlong backlash against the tech industry concerns inequality. Many tech giants are built on scale -- the idea that they can serve billions of customers while employing far fewer people than corporate giants of yore. Those dynamics are good for business, but they don't make for great optics. There's a danger that tech C.E.O.s come to be seen as out-of-touch coastal elites.

Well, they want you to know they aren't.

Amazon is so all-in on America that it wants to open another headquarters here; on Thursday, the company announced the 20 cities that made its cut as possible locations. There's one city in Canada -- Toronto -- and several coastal enclaves (New York, Washington, Los Angeles), but there's oh-so-much Middle America here, too. Wherever it ends up is, at this point, almost beside the point; Amazon has won so much positive coverage from the selection process that it can already count the story as a big win.

Meanwhile, in its own very well-designed press release, Apple announced this week that it would bring a historic pile of cash back to America. The company has about $270 billion in cash, but it had parked most of it overseas for tax reasons. Under the new tax code signed into law last year by President Trump, Apple said, it will pay $38 billion in taxes on that money -- the largest tax bill ever paid -- and invest billions in new facilities and people in the United States. The company is also giving many of its employees a $2,500 bonus.","In this week's tech newsletter, we look at Amazon's and Apple's plans to invest in the United States, plus the collapse in cryptocurrencies.",a1fd50b9-3e2b-5cb3-a42a-65b99dc3f3da,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/18/business/19AMAZONCITIES-1/19AMAZONCITIES-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=9ae873b6b8c375c3402be84a5176402f1d5f9250038ec99905fd33bc83ede145&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Outside an Amazon building in Seattle.,a1fd50b9-3e2b-5cb3-a42a-65b99dc3f3da,N24News/imgs/a1fd50b9-3e2b-5cb3-a42a-65b99dc3f3da.jpg,20
Books,Spend Some Time With the Winklevii,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/books/review/ben-mezrich-bitcoin-billionaires.html,"When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.

At the end of 2017, Bitcoin mania was in full swing. Prices of the digital currency had reached a record high of about $20,000 a pop. Wall Street banks were rushing to get in on the frenzy. Egged on by hyperbolic cheerleaders, small-time investors socked their savings in the so-called cryptocurrency. And then, just as you would expect of an asset whose value had increased exponentially in the blink of an eye, the bubble burst. The price of Bitcoins fell by about 80 percent (though it has rebounded some lately). Mainstream financial institutions scurried away, jittery about the currency's susceptibility to manipulation and money laundering. Many individuals who put their faith in the digital currency saw their fortunes erased. In ""Bitcoin Billionaires,"" Ben Mezrich chronicles the dizzying rise of the digital currency, through the eyes of two of its biggest boosters: the celebrity twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. He doesn't get around to detailing the nausea-inducing fall. The Winklevoss brothers are best known for their public brawl with the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. They all attended Harvard together, and the twins later claimed in a lawsuit that Zuckerberg stole their idea for his social network. That story is well known thanks in part to Mezrich's previous book, ""The Accidental Billionaires."" (It was adapted by Aaron Sorkin into the award-winning film ""The Social Network."")

""Bitcoin Billionaires"" is essentially a sequel to Mezrich's breezy, best-selling Facebook book. It picks up with the Winklevoss brothers prying a lucrative settlement -- cash and Facebook shares that will be worth more than $200 million -- out of Zuckerberg. They soon plow a chunk of that into the Bitcoin circus, where they encounter shameless hucksters, hapless computer geeks and shadowy criminals. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books?

In ""The Accidental Billionaires,"" the identical twins -- hulking, 6-foot-5-inch Olympic rowers -- came across as well-intentioned overachievers who fall victim to the ruthless, brilliant Zuckerberg. In ""Bitcoin Billionaires,"" Mezrich goes in a slightly different direction, caricaturing the Winklevii -- as the brothers are collectively nicknamed -- as grumpy geniuses and sympathetic underdogs. We are supposed to feel their pain as they are ostracized from Facebook-dominated Silicon Valley and as they struggle to find worthwhile companies in which to invest their nine-figure windfalls. Of course, it's hard to muster much pity for two privileged young men -- raised in Greenwich, Conn., their father a wealthy consultant -- who pocketed hundreds of millions of dollars for, in essence, spending a few months in college hatching and then failing to execute on a half-baked internet idea.

In any case, the Winklevii soon confront a series of challenges. The first is what to do with their newfound fortunes. The twins know they are destined to create important things, but they're initially not sure what those things should be. As Mezrich explains: ""Tyler and Cameron were builders. As kids they built LEGOs. As teenagers -- they built webpages."" A couple of paragraphs later, Mezrich adds, ""Tyler and Cameron didn't believe they were on the earth to exist; they were here to create, to build.""

After months of fruitless searching for things to build, the dejected twins head to Ibiza for a break -- the first ""real vacation in their entire lives,"" Mezrich notes, implausibly. They mope to a dance party, and that is where they bump into a Brooklyn entrepreneur who is touting Bitcoin as the Next Big Thing. The twins get excited, do some research, talk to Dad, and invest in an online company that makes it easier for people to acquire the digital currency. Then they use some of their Facebook winnings to buy about 1 percent of the world's total outstanding Bitcoins. Their timing is great -- Bitcoin is dirt cheap in 2013 -- and as its value rockets higher, the Winklevoss brothers get richer and richer. They go to really great parties. And some of their Silicon Valley haters eventually embrace them, old wounds salved by new wealth. Mezrich treats the brothers' Bitcoin binge as something profound, as if they are the visionaries who created the cryptocurrency rather than the rich gamblers who wagered on it. He hails their subsequent Bitcoin proselytizing as crucial to the mainstreaming of a once-obscure currency, without acknowledging that their pitch might be self-serving, intended to drive up the price of their prized asset. Mezrich is a talented storyteller, and portions of ""Bitcoin Billionaires"" offer memorable glimpses inside the messy world of a start-up currency. As the value of their Bitcoin hoard soars, for example, the twins go to elaborate (paranoid?) lengths to safeguard it, locking scraps of printed computer code in safe deposit boxes in random banks all over the country. And we encounter a genuine underdog -- one who is much more textured than the worshipfully portrayed Winklevii -- in the twins' business partner, Charlie Shrem. Raised in a Syrian Orthodox Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn, Shrem is propelled by his burning ambition to escape his parents' basement. He might be a genius, and he is certainly loyal, but he is also undisciplined, gets carried away with his fledgling fame and demonstrates remarkably poor judgment in his fellow humans.

Even here, though, Mezrich's tale is hampered by his reliance on the Winklevoss brothers as his main sources. (Mezrich writes in an author's note that the book is based on ""hundreds of sources,"" but the twins' very large fingerprints are basically the only ones visible.) The Winklevii apparently came to loathe Shrem, and the story jolts back and forth between Mezrich's attempts to capture the character's true essence and uncritical parroting of the twins' harsh judgments. Throughout, the narrative is polluted by cliches -- ""the battle for Bitcoin had just begun,"" we're told -- and stilted attempts at recreating dialogue. At one point, a recent Stanford grad simply named ""Jake"" tells the Winklevoss brothers -- then still radioactive from their war with the mighty Zuckerberg -- that he won't accept their tainted money in his virtual-reality start-up. ""It might be optics, but optics are important in a land of dreamers,"" Jake lectures. ""Your dollars might be green, but they're marked."" Come on. And then there is Mezrich's jarring disclosure at the outset that some details and settings described in the book are ""imagined."" It is hard to overcome the impression that large swaths of the book fall into that fictional zone. That includes a bizarre final scene, inside Mark Zuckerberg's office. ""The Accidental Billionaires"" also suffered from Mezrich's flippant writing and thin sourcing. But that book worked because its topic -- the creation of a social network that fundamentally changed the world, for better and for worse -- was freighted with importance. That isn't the case in ""Bitcoin Billionaires."" The supposedly revolutionary powers of digital currencies have yet to be unleashed. And while Bitcoin's rise seemed to make its enduring relevance self-evident, Mezrich doesn't bother with the consequences of its subsequent plunge -- including the inconvenient fact that the Winklevoss twins' Bitcoin fortunes no longer appear to be measured in billions.","Ben Mezrich's ""Bitcoin Billionaires"" focuses on Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who used their Facebook windfall to buy up a lot of the cryptocurrency.",11bb5d15-9b67-509f-8495-b3121c9340e8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/02/books/review/31Enrich/31Enrich-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=4d5b337b8a04c2d4817db3c0b617b6005ed6edbb9c00790d8dba3adb2b911c9b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Winklevoss twins — Tyler, left, and Cameron — in 2017.",11bb5d15-9b67-509f-8495-b3121c9340e8,N24News/imgs/11bb5d15-9b67-509f-8495-b3121c9340e8.jpg,13
Media,Shari Redstone Prepares for Battle to Control a Media Empire,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/13/business/media/shari-redstone-prepares-for-battle-to-control-a-media-empire.html,"Credit...Ryan Stone for The New York Times





Shari Redstone pulls her iPhone out of her purse to show off ""just one"" picture of her grandchildren. She laughs then apologizes when she sees that the back of the phone is covered with heart-shaped stickers -- the result of a craft session with the two youngsters. Petite, with coifed blond hair, sharp blue eyes and a cautious smile, Ms. Redstone is the picture of a doting grandmother. Beneath that cheery exterior, though, is a tenacious woman at the center of a battle over her family's fortune as well as the fate of two of the world's largest media companies, Viacom and CBS. ""My life is really good,"" Ms. Redstone, 61, said during a rare interview recently. ""It is a dream life,"" she said, ""except for the part that is not a dream life."" Ms. Redstone is the intensely private daughter of Sumner M. Redstone, the pugnacious mogul who ruthlessly assembled a $40 billion entertainment empire, including Viacom's MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon cable networks, the Paramount film and television studios and the CBS broadcast network.

A Massachusetts native who speaks in a pronounced Boston accent, Ms. Redstone shies from public attention with the same alacrity that her father attracted it. Her father and mother divorced after 52 years of marriage. He then remarried and dated women decades younger. He was sued by Ms. Redstone's uncle, brother and cousin. He has feuded publicly with his children and cycled through a series of chief executives at his companies. He famously declared that he would never die. Now, Mr. Redstone is 92, in poor health and confined to his $20 million Beverly Hills mansion. After he dies, or is deemed incompetent, Ms. Redstone is expected to face off against Viacom's current leadership, including some of her father's closest confidants, to determine what becomes of his media empire -- and by extension her children's inheritance and family's legacy. The relationship between father and daughter is complicated. She was the one he phoned after surviving a hotel fire when he was 55. He persuaded her to join the family business and once told a reporter that life wasn't complete until people had ""met Shari.""

Today she's not in his will. The bulk of the estate goes to charity. Ms. Redstone says that she has patched up her ""very public"" disagreements with her father. Lately, she has been a frequent presence in his home. That portrayal of their relationship is being challenged now in a salacious lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles by a former companion and romantic partner of Mr. Redstone. The suit says that he is not mentally competent and that Ms. Redstone manipulated him to take control of his life, his companies and his money. ""The rosy picture painted by Shari of her supposed reconciliation with her father is a smoke screen,"" Manuela Herzer, the former companion, said in a recent declaration to the court. ""Her sudden conversion to the loving, omnipresent daughter coincides with this epic battle"" for control of his empire. Ms. Redstone declined to discuss the suit or her father's health. Her spokeswoman called the claims in the suit ""unfounded,"" as have lawyers for Mr. Redstone, who declined to comment beyond their court filings. But even the judge presiding over the case has questioned whether the relationship between the father and daughter is ""as 'patched up' as claimed,"" citing that Mr. Redstone put Viacom executives ahead of his own daughter to make decisions about his health in case he is incapacitated. That legal brawl, scheduled to go to trial in May, is just one part of a broader struggle for money and power across Mr. Redstone's empire. The battleground is a uniquely convoluted corporate structure.

The trust wields great power. It could, for instance, endorse the current leadership, install a new board and executive team or even sell the companies. Ms. Redstone is one of the seven voting members of that trust. She declined to discuss board activity, and her exact plans are not clear, beyond that she does not personally want to lead either of the two companies. Also not clear is how many members of the trust will side with Ms. Redstone. Several people close to her, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations are private, say she has the support of at least two. While Ms. Redstone has supported the executive ranks at CBS, which has delivered fairly strong results, she has opposed the leadership at Viacom, which has struggled as younger viewers abandon traditional television and flock to the web. Last month, she voted against elevating Viacom's chief executive, Philippe P. Dauman, to the chairman's position when her father vacated it. Earlier, she declined the position for herself. Ms. Redstone is known to say that she has 80 percent of her father's brains, 90 percent of his passion and 100 percent of his obsessive nature. That is likely to be a forceful combination as she prepares for what is certain to be an epic saga.

* $15 minimum wage for federal contractors will take effect Jan. 30. Ms. Redstone was born in 1954, the same year her father left his lucrative job at a Washington law firm to return home to the Boston area and join his father's movie-theater chain, eventually called National Amusements. He traded his annual pay of about $100,000, or about $880,000 today, for an initial salary of about $5,000, or about $44,000 today. Back then, Mr. Redstone was a local entrepreneur, intent on expanding his chain of drive-in theaters and trading up to indoor theaters. All that changed in 1987 when Mr. Redstone wrested control of Viacom in a hostile takeover, claiming his position as a global media titan.

Sumner Redstone with his daughter, Shari, in 2000 at an awards ceremony in New York. Ms. Redstone says that she has patched up her ""very public"" disagreements with her father. By then, though, Ms. Redstone was already in her 30s. ""My father was always my father -- I never really saw him in any other role,"" Ms. Redstone said in the interview. She described her childhood as a typical suburban upbringing. The family lived in a modest house in Newton, Mass., just outside Boston. She recalled how, back in the movie-theater days, he would bring home books and Tootsie Rolls from his business trips. There was a glamorous side. In college at Tufts University, Ms. Redstone and a friend wanted to spend a summer in California, so her father set her up with a job at Paramount, where she worked on TV shows like ""Love, American Style"" and ""Mannix"" and made her share of coffee runs. Still, she said, she never saw herself working in show business. ""My father was a very strong, powerful presence in the industry, and I think it was really important for me to establish myself in a world that had nothing to do with him,"" she explained. Her preference, she said, was a career in social service. One friend, James Packer, the Australian billionaire and son of the media mogul Kerry Packer, who died in 2005, said in an interview that he understood the pressures. ""We're the children of fathers with big shadows,"" he said. ""We are all so lucky to have those fathers. Life is complex."" Ms. Redstone went to law school and worked as a criminal defense lawyer at a small Boston firm. She married in 1980, started a family and, when her children were older, decided to pursue a degree in social work after volunteering at a trauma center for abused children.

""My grandfather started this business,"" she said. ""It was our family legacy."" Ms. Redstone, who was going through a divorce at the time, agreed to work at National Amusements two days a week for a year. Six months later she was working full time. At National Amusements, Ms. Redstone focused on two areas where she thought she could carve out her own reputation: expanding internationally into Russia and South America, and upgrading the moviegoing experience beyond popcorn tubs and sticky theater floors. In some theaters she began adding reserved premium seating, full dining menus and cocktails she helped design, such as the S'mores Martini, a mix of vodka, toasted-marshmallow syrup, cream and a marshmallow garnish. She is particularly proud that Tom Brady, the quarterback for the New England Patriots, and his wife, Gisele Bundchen, have told her that they go to the chain's Showcase SuperLux theater in Chestnut Hill, Mass., for date night. ""I don't like to follow in the footsteps,"" Ms. Redstone said. ""I like to learn from the footsteps that came before me, forge a new path."" National Amusements is a private company, so it is difficult to gauge its business performance over the years. Jawad Hussain, an analyst for Standard & Poor's, called the company's management and governance ""weak"" because National Amusement's core theater business is operating ""below average compared to peers"" on measures such as cash flow generated per theater.

As time went on, the harmony between father and daughter got out of sync. There was a series of public squabbles after Mr. Redstone brought her in as vice chairwoman of Viacom in 2005. (The first time he asked, she said no.) She pushed for more authority and stronger corporate governance measures, such as tying compensation to performance. At least once, he threatened to oust her. She was the only member of the National Amusements board to oppose investing several hundred million dollars in Midway Games, the video game company that eventually filed for bankruptcy. And in 2008 she helped National Amusements refinance debt payments that ultimately forced the sale of Viacom and CBS shares, which he had opposed. Philippe P. Dauman and his wife, Deborah, last October in Milan. Last month, Shari Redstone voted against elevating Mr. Dauman, Viacom's chief executive, to the chairman's position when her father vacated it. Over the years, some Viacom executives described Ms. Redstone as meddlesome and impatient in a quest for power, questioning her business acumen. Mel Karmazin, a former chief executive of Viacom, decided that neither Ms. Redstone nor her brother, Brent, who both were on the board at the time, should attend budget meetings. Some media executives have questioned whether the reaction to Ms. Redstone was, in part, because she was a woman in a male-dominated business. Others characterized her as earnest, eager, smart and cognizant of the digital changes transforming the business. After helping National Amusements negotiate its debts, Ms. Redstone decided it was time to set off on her own path. Today, she remains its president, yet her new focus is the venture capital firm Advancit Capital, which she started in 2011 with her son-in-law, Jason Ostheimer. The firm, which invests in media and technology start-ups, has had some high-profile sales, including a $500 million sale of Maker Studios, which creates online video programming, to the Walt Disney Company. Advancit recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise an additional $40 million for investments. ""I am seeing the world as it is going to be,"" Ms. Redstone said of Advancit's ambitions. ""I am exposed to the future, not just of media, but of the world.""

Ms. Redstone also spoke in April at the White House on behalf of a group promoting legal help for people with low incomes, a reflection, she says, of her early career dreams. Over the years, Ms. Redstone has struggled to balance her desire to make her own mark on the Redstone legacy yet live a quiet life and shield herself, her children and her grandchildren from the spotlight. She loves to cook, has held season tickets to the Patriots since 1986 and asks for recommendations for new TV shows to binge-watch. Two favorites are ""Jane the Virgin"" and ""The Bletchley Circle."" She is known to walk the hallways of hotels for exercise and at night listens to podcasts or short stories by Dostoyevsky because she doesn't sleep well. ""It is really hard when your life is scrutinized by people who don't know you and who don't really know what the situation is,"" Ms. Redstone said. ""So I avoid the good and the bad and just try to live in a world where I can insulate myself from whatever is out there."" Recently, Ms. Redstone and her family took a vacation to celebrate her mother's 91st birthday. After a dinner one evening in a room overlooking the ocean, Ms. Redstone received a note from the staff telling her that they appeared to be the perfect happy family. ""Oh, God,"" she later recalled, with a laugh. ""You guys don't know the half of it.""",Ms. Redstone says she has patched up her relationship with her media mogul father as a legal battle looms over money and power in the family business.,d7aa0b78-f914-5a54-8070-d72d65448bf5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/11/business/13shari-top/13shari-top-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=341974baa1f08ed39896d77ee5307913f2ac465d39655a3395b06aa3daab6923&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""My life is really good,"" Shari Redstone, the media mogul Sumner Redstone's daughter, said during a rare interview recently.

Your Money,Paying the Price for a Personal Drill Sergeant,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/23/your-money/paying-the-price-for-a-personal-drill-sergeant.html,"OMAR AMANAT, the chairman of the Aman Resorts Group, is on the road a lot for his job, visiting his company's resorts. On these trips, he likes to cycle through the surrounding area -- often with his personal trainer from New York to make sure he doesn't take it easy. ""I do intervals, and knowing when to switch up the intensity level is important,"" Mr. Amanat said from Montenegro. ""Otherwise, I'd be looking around and drop off for some gelato."" Dale Noelle, a former model who owns her own modeling agency, True Model Management, has traveled with her trainer, too, but prefers to use her more for the convenience. ""She came at 9 p.m. the other night,"" Ms. Noelle said. ""I like that she'll come at 6 a.m. or in the middle of the day, too."" And while she and her trainer often work out in her apartment in New York, Ms. Noelle says she gets bored easily and likes that her trainer is creative. ""She makes up exercises for me because of injuries I have,"" she said. ""We work out outside, in Central Park or in the Hamptons. We've done exercises on stand-up paddleboards.""

This is the kind of personal attention that only money can buy. Whether it is worth the price is in the eye -- or biceps -- of the beholder. ""People don't need a personal trainer,"" said Ryan Serhant, a real estate broker and star of Bravo's ""Million Dollar Listing New York,"" who actually has two trainers -- one for weekdays and one for weekend martial arts. ""If you can wake up every morning and have your own routine, to each his own,"" he said. ""But because I am so busy, it's an investment I'm willing to make."" With summer approaching, and bathing suits coming out of storage, what would you get if you could afford a top trainer? And can you replicate any of it if you can't afford to pay a trainer to follow you around? A well-qualified personal trainer who comes to your home will cost $120 to $150 an hour. A trainer who offers nutritional advice costs about $200 an hour, and those with their own brand and following can command $250 an hour. In contrast, a basic trainer at the Equinox chain of gyms in New York costs $105 an hour, or $92 an hour in a package of 24 sessions.

Matthew Cluney, chief executive of Ballast Partners, which does financial services marketing, said he decided to hire a trainer to work with him two days a week in his building's gym because he felt that he was throwing money away on a gym membership he never used. ""I'm paying a premium for sure to do this, but I feel like I'm getting a lot more from that time,"" he said. ""I feel like all that money I'm spending is directly going to me. For me, it's worth the premium."" Mr. Amanat says he hardly thinks of the rates he pays -- which he wouldn't disclose -- because he feels his trainer is so focused on his health, at home and when they travel abroad. But personal training rates go up quickly, particularly when travel is involved or requests for services are unusual. One trainer said the going rate was $2,000 a week to travel with a client, in addition to all flight, hotel and food expenses for the trip. Dan Anderson, a martial arts instructor in New York, said he once signed a three-month contract to train an executive at any time with only one hour's notice. Essentially he was at the executive's beck and call. Mr. Anderson said he calculated the fee by adding up his hourly rate, weekend rate and on-call rate and rolling them together. He wouldn't disclose the actual fee, other than to say it was ""expensive."" ""I'd get a call, and I'd go and wait at the Plaza Hotel,"" Mr. Anderson said. ""This person canceled every single time.""

He ended up training the client a half dozen times in the three months. One time, after waiting for hours, Mr. Anderson and a world kickboxing champion the client also had on retainer ordered oysters and Champagne from room service. Even under normal circumstances -- where people actually exercise -- the top personal trainers monitor everything a client does. Louis Coraggio, chief executive of Body Architect, his personal training business, and trampoLean, a fitness program that uses mini-trampolines, says he limits the number of private clients to six so he can focus on them intently. ""I'm committed to them,"" he said. ""I'm willing to pack my bags and go on vacation with them. I make that very clear when I start with them. It's not just something that stops at the end of the session."" ""Of course,"" he added, ""everything has to be worked out with the numbers."" With new clients, he will create a gym for them at home. If the space is small, he will emphasize balls, resistance bands and other equipment that can be stowed away. When clients travel without him, he asks them to text photos of the hotel gym, and he sends them a workout tailored to the equipment there. Tommy Boyer, a former dancer who owns Manhattan Wardrobe & Beauty Supply, said he was awakened on many days by Mr. Coraggio buzzing from the apartment's lobby. ""I roll out of bed and he's there,"" Mr. Boyer said. He credits this arrangement with keeping him fit and free of back pain, from injuries sustained as a dancer. It is also something he cannot avoid, whereas he might skip going to the gym, which is six blocks from his apartment.

Personal trainers also look at the client's diet. This is where people who can't afford a personal trainer but still make it to the gym can take heed. Mr. Amanat said his trainer, who goes by the name Joe Trainer, focuses a lot of time on what he eats. ""Nutrition is just as important as working out,"" he said. ""At first, I gained weight because I was so hungry. I had to train myself to eat less."" Likewise, Mr. Serhant, who says he goes out most nights for work or fun, remains just as focused on what he eats as on how often he exercises. ""It's 70 percent diet, to be fit and look fit,"" he said. ""You can't do a really great workout and be spent and then eat bagels all day. You have to treat your body like a car."" The real reason to have a trainer, in a gym or next to you while you cycle in the mountains, is to push you into working out more than you otherwise would. Ms. Noelle said that after having her first child she was doing the same exercises and struggling to lose the last 10 pounds of baby weight. And Mr. Boyer said he would be 30 pounds heavier without Mr. Coraggio's prodding. ""When I want to cancel, he asks me why,"" he said. ""If I say I'm tired, he says, 'We'll figure something out and get a workout in.' He really cares about what he's doing and about what is working for me."" Even Julie Karlitz, chief executive of Strap-Its, a women's apparel company, who has a tennis court in her backyard and gym in her house in Alpine, N.J., said she could not push herself to work out without someone there.

""I truly hate working out,"" she said. With her first trainer, she said, ""I used to turn the lights out and pretend I wasn't home when he came to my door."" She opens the door now, she said, because she feels she needs to look fit for her business and to show her daughters, who are 18 and 20, the value of fitness. ""You buy a pocketbook today and it's out of style next year,"" Ms. Karlitz said. ""I feel like a trainer is money well spent. It's your health. It makes me a better mother. It makes me more focused in business."" So this weekend, while you're sipping a cocktail at the beach or on your deck, remember: Many people with trainers would be doing the same thing if they didn't have someone to count the calories in that margarita and hand them a jump rope first thing in the morning.","For those who can afford the luxury, personal trainers will conduct private, specialized exercise classes at any hour or in any location.",977f5e9f-9735-5b92-9968-9cbb5a28f2a3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/22/business/23wealth-web/23wealth-web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=2597487b9bca09b69862edf33693088ee6734ce02ad9e0a9859c3fa6f2e08e76&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dale Noelle, right, owner of True Model Management, exercising with her personal trainer, Tonia D'Angelo, at her Upper East Side apartment.",977f5e9f-9735-5b92-9968-9cbb5a28f2a3,N24News/imgs/977f5e9f-9735-5b92-9968-9cbb5a28f2a3.jpg,21
Art & Design,20 Art Exhibitions to View in N.Y.C. This Weekend,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/arts/design/art-and-museums-in-nyc-this-week.html," 'ANSEL ADAMS IN OUR TIME' at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston (through Feb. 24). This far-ranging, smartly and instructively installed show of more than 100 of Adams's photographs -- noble and challenging images of our country's heritage, most of them from the Lane Collection -- is not a mere retrospective; it also includes about 80 images by 23 contemporary photographers that the curator, Karen Haas, sees as a modern lens on his work. Although the connections are occasionally a bit tenuous, their addition highlights how Adams, who carried the 19th century's hymn to America into the 20th century, has remained an inescapable force. (Vicky Goldberg) 

617-267-9300, mfa.org 'HILMA AF KLINT: PAINTINGS FOR THE FUTURE' at Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (through April 23). This rapturous exhibition upends Modernism's holiest genesis tale -- that the male trinity of Kandinsky, Malevich and Mondrian invented abstract painting starting in 1913. It demonstrates that a female Swedish artist got there first (1906-7), in great style and a radically bold scale with paintings that feel startlingly contemporary. The mother of all revisionist shows regarding Modernism. (Roberta Smith) 

212-423-3500, guggenheim.org 'BLACK CITIZENSHIP IN THE AGE OF JIM CROW' at the New-York Historical Society (through March 3). This exhibition about Reconstruction and its aftermath doesn't draw explicit parallels to today's politics. But perhaps it doesn't have to. Reconstruction can be a challenging story to tell, given how it cuts against deeply held American ideas about steady moral progress. It can also seem like a very abstract story, dominated by Constitutional amendments, legal battles and court decisions. ""Black Citizenship,"" which fills three small upstairs galleries, covers the legal and political landmarks, but it also includes poignant artifacts that show how ordinary people fought the battle for -- and against -- racial equality on the ground. (Jennifer Schuessler)

212-872-3400, nyhistory.org 'BLUE PRINTS: THE PIONEERING WORK OF ANNA ATKINS' at New York Public Library, Stephen A. Schwarzman Building (through Feb. 17). An intimate, exquisite show of a pioneer of photography and natural science. In the early 1840s, Atkins, a seaweed-loving Englishwoman, began documenting aquatic plants through the new technique of cyanotype (or blueprint, as architects would later call it), and sewed her spectral images into the very first books of ""photographical impressions"" -- albeit ones made without a camera. Atkins, perhaps assisted by servants, placed hundreds of specimens of seaweed or algae on coated paper, left them in the sun, and then washed the exposed sheet to produce white shadows of the plants against rich Prussian blue backgrounds. Each one is a little miracle, with neuronlike roots winding across the page, the leaves revealing every branching vein. (Jason Farago)

'CONSTANTIN BRANCUSI SCULPTURE: THE FILMS' at the Museum of Modern Art (through Feb. 18). This show is built around works by the Romanian modernist (1876-1957) that have been longtime highlights of the museum's own collection. But these days, can Brancusi still release our inner poet? The answer may lie in paying less attention to the sculptures themselves and more to Brancusi's little-known and quite amazing films, projected at the entrance to the gallery throughout the duration of the exhibition. MoMA borrowed the series of video clips from the Pompidou Center in Paris. They give the feeling that Brancusi was less interested in making fancy museum objects than in putting new kinds of almost-living things into the world, and they convey the vital energy his sculptures were meant to capture. (Blake Gopnik) 

212-708-9400, moma.org 'ROCHELLE FEINSTEIN: IMAGE OF AN IMAGE' at the Bronx Museum of the Arts (through March 3). In her career survey, this wisecracking Bronx native proves that she can do just about anything with painting. She can chronicle history or tell a joke. She can alchemize linen, photographs, newspapers, cardboard and photocopies into art. She can teach you something about looking and life. A whiz with color, she sprays and squeezes paint, and stains with it. Several works feel like odes to color charts or to the color theory art students learn in school. A morbid strain runs through other works as Feinstein grapples with and battles the forces trying to shut down painting in favor of other media. (Martha Schwendener)

718-681-6000, bronxmuseum.org 'LUCIO FONTANA: ON THE THRESHOLD' at the Met Breuer (through April 14). The art of this Argentine-Italian modernist looks a bit like it comes from another planet, and it might as well, given how seldom we see it in New York. The Met Breuer show, with single environments at the Met Fifth Avenue and El Museo del Barrio, is the artist's first museum survey here in over 40 years. This wouldn't be especially notable -- plenty of his Latin American peers never get seen at all -- were Fontana, who died in 1968, not so influential a figure. The ""threshold"" in the title refers not only to the early phase of his career, which the Met Breuer show highlights, but also to his position as a forebear of contemporary art as we know it. Things we take for granted -- installation, new media and the poly-disciplinary impulse that defines so many 21st-century careers -- Fontana pioneered in the 1950s. (Holland Cotter)

212-535-7710, metmuseum.org 'THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION' at the Museum of the Moving Image. The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America's great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program ""Sam and Friends"" before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother's old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through ""Sesame Street"" and ""The Muppet Show,"" though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and storyboards and rediscover some old friends. (Farago)

'THE LONG RUN' at the Museum of Modern Art. The museum upends its cherished Modern narrative of ceaseless progress by mostly young (white) men. Instead we see works by artists 45 and older who have just kept on keeping on, regardless of attention or reward, sometimes saving the best for last. Art here is an older person's game, a pursuit of a deepening personal vision over innovation. Winding through 17 galleries, the installation is alternatively visually or thematically acute and altogether inspiring. (Smith) 

212-708-9400, moma.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] 'BRUCE NAUMAN: DISAPPEARING ACTS' at the Museum of Modern Art (through Feb. 18) and MoMA PS1 (through Feb. 25). If art isn't basically about life and death, and the emotions and ethics they inspire, what is it about? Style? Taste? Auction results? The most interesting artists go right for the big, uncool existential stuff, which is what Bruce Nauman does in a transfixing half-century retrospective that fills the entire sixth floor of MoMA and much of MoMA PS1 in Long Island City, Queens. The MoMA installation is tightly paced and high decibel; the one at PS1, which includes a trove of works on paper, is comparatively mellow and mournful. Each location offers a rough chronological overview of his career, but catching both parts of the show is imperative. Nauman has changed the way we define what art is and what is art, and made work prescient of the morally wrenching American moment we're in. He deserves to be seen in full. (Cotter)

Joseph Tetteh Ashong, better known as Paa Joe, is Ghana's pre-eminent funerary carpenter, turning out thousands of brightly colored lions, soda bottles and automobiles for people to be buried in. Most of his exuberant pieces enjoy the light of day for only a few hours before they disappear into the ground. But in 2004, Paa Joe was commissioned by the art dealer and gallerist Claude Simard to make casket-size hardwood models of 13 former Gold Coast slave forts, and seven of them are now at AFAM. Thanks to Paa Joe's gift for transmuting even the most complex and brutal material into a cheerful expression of his own artistic temperament, the works' undeniable conceptual weight doesn't hamper the overwhelming visual pleasure.

212-595-9533, folkartmuseum.org 'R.H. QUAYTMAN: +X, CHAPTER 34' at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (through April 23). At the summit the Guggenheim's spiraling rotunda, this show appears as if the exhibition of the Swedish artist Hilma af Klint, on the floors below, had suddenly exploded into 28 fragments. Quaytman made this series of works in 2018 in response to af Klint's oeuvre from the last century, and Quaytman is the perfect artist to answer af Klint: Af Klint worked in series, and Quaytman works in what she calls ""chapters."" Where af Klint took orders from spirits she claimed to have contacted through seances, Quaytman, for this project, has adopted af Klint as her higher power, working in a more secular, channeled collaborative vein. And where af Klint offers a bright, dynamic symphony, Quaytman responds with a spare, restrained and slightly dissonant tone poem. (Schwendener) 

212-423-3575, guggenheim.org 'BETYE SAAR: KEEPIN' IT CLEAN' at the New-York Historical Society (through May 27). Saar has been making important and influential work for nearly 60 years. Yet no big New York museum has given her a full retrospective, or even a significant one-person show, since a 1975 solo at the Whitney Museum of American Art. As this exhibition demonstrates, the institutional oversight is baffling, as her primary themes -- racial justice and feminism (her 1972 breakthrough piece, ""The Liberation of Aunt Jemima,"" merges the two by transforming the racist stereotype of the smiling black mammy into an armed freedom fighter) -- are exactly attuned to the present.

'STERLING RUBY: CERAMICS' at the Museum of Art and Design (through March 17). Adept at most art mediums, this artist is at his best in ceramics, especially in the outsize, awkwardly hand-built, resplendently glazed baskets, ashtrays and plates and the objects that verge on sculpture in this show. These works actively incorporate accident and aspects of the ready-made, have precedents in the large-scale ceramics of Peter Voulkos and Viola Frey, but may be closest in spirit to the Neo-Expressionism of Julian Schnabel -- rehabilitated, of course.

212-299-7777, madmuseum.org 'SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION' at the Jewish Museum. After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike -- Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilettantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago) 

212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org 'ANDY WARHOL -- FROM A TO B AND BACK AGAIN' at the Whitney Museum of American Art (through March 31). Although this is the artist's first full American retrospective in 31 years, he's been so much with us -- in museums, galleries, auctions -- as to make him, like wallpaper, like the atmosphere, only half-noticed. The Whitney show restores him to a full, commanding view, but does so in a carefully shaped and edited way, with an emphasis on very early and late work. Despite the show's monumentalizing size, it's a human-scale Warhol we see. Largely absent is the artist-entrepreneur who is taken as a prophet of our market-addled present. What we have instead is Warhol for whom art, whatever else it was, was an expression of personal hopes and fears. (Cotter)

212-570-3600, whitney.org 'EMPRESSES OF CHINA'S FORBIDDEN CITY' at the Peabody Essex Museum, Salem, Mass. (through Feb. 10). Every emperor of the Qing dynasty had dozens of wives, concubines and serving girls, but only one of them could hold the title of empress. The lives of women at the late imperial court is the subject of this lavish and learned exhibition, which plots the fortunes of these consorts through their bogglingly intricate silk gowns, hairpins detailed with peacock feathers, and killer platform boots. (The Qing elite were Manchus; women did not bind their feet.) Many empresses' lives are lost to history; some, like the Dowager Empress Cixi, became icons in their own right. Most of the 200-odd dresses, jewels, religious artifacts and scroll paintings here are on rare loan from the Palace Museum in Beijing -- you will not have a chance to see these again without a trip to the People's Republic.

This landmark show uses a new lens on 19th-century French art history. Progressiveness -- both artistic and social -- is measured by the way black women are depicted in the paintings of the period; this yardstick is also applied to subsequent generations of European, American and African artists. A revelatory thesis, brilliantly executed. (Smith) 

212-854-6800, wallach.columbia.edu 'SOUL OF A NATION: ART IN THE AGE OF BLACK POWER' at the Brooklyn Museum (through Feb. 3). It will be a happy day when racial harmony rules in the land. But that day's not arriving any time soon. Who could have guessed in the 1960s when civil rights became law that a new century would bring white supremacy tiki-torching out of the closet and turn the idea that black lives matter, so beyond obvious, into a battle cry? Actually, African-Americans were able to see such things coming. No citizens know the national narrative, and its implacable racism, better. And no artists have responded to that history-that-won't-go-away more powerfully than black artists have. More than 60 of them appear in this big, beautiful, passionate show of art that functioned as seismic detector, political persuader and defensive weapon. (Cotter)

Well,Doctors Brace for Zika Babies,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/26/well/family/doctors-brace-for-zika-babies.html,"Exposure to Zika while pregnant does not mean a child definitely will be born with microcephaly, an unusually small brain and head, or have Zika-related health problems. But the risk is real, and pediatricians are trying to figure out how to follow these children, and how to take care of the ones who do have problems. While nobody knows the actual risk of Zika exposure to a fetus, studies have suggested that between 1 percent and 13 percent of pregnant women infected with Zika in the first trimester will have a child with microcephaly, but more could have children with more subtle developmental problems related to in utero exposure to the virus.

Earlier this month, the American Academy of Pediatrics announced a $350,000 grant from the Department of Health and Human Services to create a network of pediatricians prepared to deal with a generation of children with Zika-related health problems. When babies are born with damaged brains because of Zika they will need medical care and their families will need support.

But how do you prepare for a new and evolving and still poorly understood clinical challenge? Pediatric experts got together over the summer to talk about it. The meeting was convened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in collaboration with the American Academy of Pediatrics, and it brought together a range of pediatric subspecialists, from neonatology and neurology, infectious diseases and developmental behavioral pediatrics, rehabilitation medicine, ophthalmology and orthopedics and more.

There's so much we don't know. Dr. Peter Jay Hotez, the dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said several big questions need to be answered. How does the virus do its damage? What is the full spectrum of damage, from the clearly visible microcephaly to less visible neurological changes? And what happens to babies exposed to Zika after birth, when the brain is still developing?

The meeting yielded interim guidelines, published in the C.D.C. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. ""Initially at C.D.C., our biggest goal was to make sure pregnant women didn't get Zika,"" said Dr. Sonja Rasmussen, a pediatrician and clinical geneticist who is the director of the Division of Public Health Information Dissemination at the C.D.C. ""This meeting was really trying to make sure those babies have the best chance to reach their fullest potential.""

For the children born with microcephaly, whose fetal brain growth has clearly been disrupted by the virus, the recommendations draw on the very recent and quickly evolving experience of doctors in Brazil. These babies are at risk for seizures, feeding problems, tightly contracted joints, thyroid problems, eye problems, and developmental delays. They need regular neurological examinations, hearing tests, vision tests, hormone tests and lots of medical backup.

""If you see a child who has such significant microcephaly, you know the issues,"" said Dr. Fan Tait, a pediatric neurologist who is one of the associate directors at the A.A.P. and took part in the meeting.",How do doctors prepare for an evolving clinical challenge that is still poorly understood?,a0cba2d4-6358-5aa6-87c7-fd10ce245888,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/24/science/klass-doctorsart/klass-doctorsart-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=2d0763f6ee2453fac66893b8983eae6122d3e62e2b2ec1138a5c216ece841ea3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Dr. Albert de la Vega studies a sonogram of a patient in Puerto Rico.,a0cba2d4-6358-5aa6-87c7-fd10ce245888,N24News/imgs/a0cba2d4-6358-5aa6-87c7-fd10ce245888.jpg,18
Opinion,How to Persuade Trump to Concede,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/opinion/letters/trump-election-concession.html,"It seems to me that President Trump's continued refusal to concede defeat is less a sinister plot to cling to power and more a determination to somehow declare victory even in defeat. If the recent vaccine news holds true, that will be an extraordinary accomplishment by our scientific community, and let's give credit where it's due -- and maybe even some that's not due.

Let's all agree to praise Mr. Trump for Operation Warp Speed's success and congratulate him for the fastest and most robust (or best and most beautiful) vaccine campaign in history. Let him take that win as his way to declare a personal victory and make way for President-elect Joe Biden.

If Mr. Trump is going to continue to hold incredible sway over his supporters in his post-presidency, I can think of no better role for him than as a champion of the effectiveness of the ""Trump"" Covid vaccines. Maybe he can reach people who would otherwise be reluctant to get vaccinated.

So let me be the first to congratulate him. Heckuva job, Donnie!

Fashion & Style,"In Fragrance, Rose Is the New Unisex",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/02/fashion/rose-perfume-stella-mccartney.html,"When Gertrude Stein wrote ""a rose is a rose is a rose,"" she probably wasn't thinking about perfume. When it comes to fragrances, rose is a coveted ingredient that is able to shape-shift; there is no one true rose scent. Instead, the flower, which mythologically bloomed from Aphrodite's tears over her lover Adonis, plays extremely well with other ingredients, allowing a perfumer to use it as a kind of lush canvas upon which to dream up a new olfactory memory. Depending on the perfumer's vision, rose can smell fresh or feral, peppery or syrupy, whisper light or as dank as a mossy cave. It can soften up a woodsy composition or add a voluptuous undernote to an otherwise chemical scent. It turns ouds creamy and makes fruits flirtatious. Yet despite its heroic position in the perfumer's tool kit, rose has backslid in recent years as a star ingredient (with the exception of some popular designer fragrances, like Stella McCartney's signature powdery bonbon or the over-honeyed party spritz that is Viktor & Rolf's Flowerbomb). Most contemporary rose scents in the mainstream market are aimed at young women, who presumably want to smell like an inoffensive, dewy bouquet. Such fragrances often come in pink and violet bottles, tied up with grosgrain ribbon or with waxy rose-shaped caps. (See Dolce & Gabbana's latest offering, Rosa Excelsa.) But independent perfumers are now bringing back the rose in all its glory, liberating it from the delicate bottles and coquettish reputation to prove that giant, heady rose can be a powerhouse on men and women alike. Rose -- the scent of passion, of love, of dulcet longing -- is the new unisex.

""Back then, they put rose water on doves and had them fly around,"" she said. ""Roman men loved wearing rose, and the men I work with today still love it."" Recently, Ms. Aftel ran a class for Apple's design team, and, she said, ""It was all men."" ""I cannot tell you how many of them picked florals for their custom perfumes. Once you smell a truly beautiful, buttery, velvety rose, it is impossible to resist it."" This season, independent perfumers like Roja Dove, Andy Tauer and Christopher Chong have all released new rose-forward scents designed to appeal equally to men and women. These are powerful, statement roses, using the most exquisite flowers from Turkey and Syria, and they smell intoxicating on nearly everyone (or so perfumers claim).

One of the heady new fragrances is Rose by Roja Dove, the British master perfumer whom GQ magazine recently named ""the pornographer of perfume"" for his extremely sensitive nose and penchant for carnal, musky odors. ""I wanted to make something that could make someone feel abandon,"" Mr. Dove said. ""Roses can sometimes can smell very thin, and that was of no interest to me. I put pepper and a little touch of nutmeg in this composition, to give it a vibrancy, and a touch of freshness with bergamot and geranium."" Mr. Dove is not surprised that people of all types have gravitated toward his roses. ""The whole thing of gender in a raw material is stereotyping that is Victorian,"" he said. (Speaking of Victorian, Mr. Dove is known to wear velvet smoking jackets and large diamond-encrusted rings in the shapes of wild animals.)

""A man's skin fundamentally smells very different to a woman's,"" he said. ""It's not as soft, more overtly sexual, more earthy. It will transform the rose, make the rose smell more masculine. An identical rose on a woman's skin will smell more feminine."" Mr. Dove added that the most surprising and modern roses ""speak of a fantastic androgyny."" ""We are starting to see a generation that is self-assured enough that they will wear any fragrance that they feel smells right,"" he said. ""They don't need to be told it is for women or men."" Mr. Chong, the creative director of the Amouage fragrance house, based in Oman, says that for his new scent, Opus X, a rose-heavy perfume inspired by ""The Red Violin"" (it truly does smell as if someone waxed a string instrument in sylvan varnish), the Amouage team used Centifolia rose, rather than the more traditional Egyptian roses, in combination with a hybrid rose that's half natural and half synthetic. ""There is a dry and metallic rose accord that alludes to classicism, but is also seductive, which makes it suitable for the modern man and woman,"" Mr. Chong said.

Geza Schoen, a German perfumer and the creator of the cult-popular Escentric Molecules line, recently released two rose-heavy unisex scents as part of his experimental Beautiful Mind series. ""When we think of roses, we need to consider the origin of the flower,"" Mr. Schoen said. ""The rose in times past was a symbol of power, and so of the traditional idea of man. History repeats itself, and the rose is the man's flower once again."" Not all perfumers are so adamant on returning rose to the realm of man, but many do express the desire to strip it of gender connotations and let the flower speak on its own. Some newer rose scents with this kind of crossover appeal include A la rose from Maison Francis Kurkdjian, Bitter Rose, Broken Spear from the Brooklyn indie house Hylnds, and Tobacco Rose from the rule-breaking British perfumer Liz Moores of Papillon Artisan Perfumes.

""In niche fragrances, the whole concept of gender doesn't work very well,"" said Mr. Tauer, creator of the Tauer line of indie perfumes, which includes several rose-soaked scents. ""My Rose Chypree works very well on man's skin, provided you like classic perfumery, because you have all these resins, patchouli, ambery notes."" If looked at from a perfumer's point of view, rose oil, the steam-distilled kind, doesn't smell like the flower. ""It is very spicy,"" Mr. Tauer said. ""If you look at the natural rose, beneath the sweet honey floral notes, there is also a woodsiness to it. The idea that this flower bends to one gender is obsolete."" Even new fragrances that don't have rose in their names rely heavily on the note, like Byredo's unisex Super Cedar, which layers rose petals over cedar wood and Haitian vetiver (and smells on the skin like an herbaceous campfire).",Rose-heavy perfumes have been liberated from their powdery past to become the new powerhouse scent for men as well as women.,2adbb2ac-d740-5cb4-bffd-b97e6c715fc3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/02/fashion/02SKINDEEP-SPAN/02SKINDEEP-SPAN-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=f18b36aee10c052d2e0612c96840e49ee6d85da622da54f995e3864f4ca5db94&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A shape-shifter that plays well with other ingredients.,2adbb2ac-d740-5cb4-bffd-b97e6c715fc3,N24News/imgs/2adbb2ac-d740-5cb4-bffd-b97e6c715fc3.jpg,19
Media,What to Know About the Fight Between Hollywood's Writers and Agents,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/business/media/wga-writers-agents-hollywood.html,"What to Know About the Fight Between Hollywood's Writers and Agents

LOS ANGELES -- An unusual labor fight is shaking up Hollywood. The unions representing television and film writers have taken on the talent agencies, rather than the studios that employ them, as they did in previous disputes. Before the two sides can make peace, the entertainment industry may have to undergo structural changes. On Friday afternoon, negotiations collapsed between union leaders for television and movie writers and representatives of the talent agencies. The issues underlying the dispute are many-stranded, but the short version is this: The Writers Guild of America believes that talent agents are putting their own interests ahead of those of their clients. In the writers' view, the agents are not fulfilling their legally bound fiduciary duties. The agents firmly disagree. While they offered a counterproposal during talks last week, they shunned the writers' call for deep changes to the way business has been done for decades.

During talks, the writers asked the agents to sign a new code of conduct that would replace a formal deal that had been in place since 1976. While some agents from minor agencies agreed to the code, the great majority, including the agents at the most powerful agencies, refused to sign on. After the failed talks, union leaders informed their members to break ties with any agency that had not signed the code. Who are the main players? The Writers Guild of America comprises two affiliated unions, the W.G.A. West, based in Los Angeles, and the W.G.A. East, based in New York. They represent roughly 13,000 writers. The Association of Talent Agents is representing the interests of the agents. The association's main constituents are the big four agencies: William Morris Endeavor, Creative Artists Agency, United Talent Agency and ICM Partners. Will the writers really go through with firing their agents? It looks that way. If they don't, they will not be abiding by W.G.A. Working Rule 23, which bars members from working with agents who have not agreed to the new code of conduct. A number of writers have already broken with their representatives.

Mike Schur, the co-creator of ""Parks and Recreation"" and ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"" tweeted at the end of talks: ""WGA Members: What happens now? We stick together."" (Mr. Schur was one of the participants in the negotiations.) What does an agent do, anyway? The main job for writers' representatives is to help the writers find employment and negotiate the highest possible compensation on their behalf. By law, agents must act in the best financial interest of their clients. They must also inform them of any possible conflicts of interest in a given deal. There are all kinds of agents. The ideal version is a fierce advocate who may also act as an occupational therapist. At the other end of the spectrum is the one who doesn't call you back. These days, the writers say, even the most assiduous agents can work against their clients' interests, because the system itself is broken. Can't a lawyer or manager do the same things an agent does? On this, the writers and agents strongly disagree. The W.G.A. unions say that they are the writers' exclusive bargaining representatives. As such, they can delegate who gets to negotiate on behalf of their members, and they have not hesitated to signal to managers and lawyers that they may effectively take on the duties of agents on the writers' behalf. But Latham & Watkins, the law firm working for the agents, sent a letter to the W.G.A. on Friday saying that, if managers or lawyers function as agents, they would be breaking the law. The firm pointed to the California Talent Agency Act and New York's General Business law. No one may assume agenting duties without having an agent's license, Latham & Watkins said in the letter, which went on to threaten that the agents would ""take appropriate action as needed, against any person engaged in unfair competition."" The writers countered that, with the legal letter, the agents were ""attempting to intimidate attorneys and managers to stop them from performing work they routinely do.""

What was the old deal between the writers and agents, and how did the writers want to change it? In 1976, writers and agents signed the Artists' Managers Basic Agreement, which regulated how talent agents represented writers. The 43-year-old arrangement had fallen woefully out of date, in the W.G.A.'s view. With the proposed new code of conduct, the writers demanded that agencies rid themselves of packaging fees and get out of the production business. What is packaging and what are packaging fees? Packaging is a decades-old practice under which agencies may team writers with other clients from their stables for a given project. With packaging fees, an agent forgoes the usual 10 percent commission fee paid to them by individual clients; in its place, they are paid directly by the studio. What is the difference between how the writers and agents view packaging and packaging fees? The two sides are miles apart on this question. Agents say the writers do not fundamentally understand packaging and the fees that go with it. The writers say they understand it just fine -- they just find it to be corrupt. The writers argue that agencies violate their fiduciary obligations to their clients when they make money from studios instead of from the people they are representing. The practice of accepting packaging fees, the writers say, allows the agencies to enrich themselves at the writers' expense when they should be using their leverage to get more money for writer-clients. The agencies say they don't buy that argument. To bolster the agents' position, United Talent Agency conducted an analysis meant to show that writers earned more from packaged shows than non-packaged shows. With packaging, the agencies argue, the interests of agents and writers are directly aligned. Because agencies don't make money on failed shows, the agents argue, they have the same motivation as writers in creating hits.

Did the agencies consider getting rid of packaging fees during talks? No. The Association of Talent Agents offered a counterproposal under which the agents would have handed over 1 percent of packaging-fee profits to writers from successful series. The W.G.A. said this was ""not a serious proposal."" How does the agencies' entry into the production business play into the dispute? There are agency-affiliated companies that have moved into the production business -- and this does not sit well with the writers unions. W.M.E., for instance, has an affiliate company called Endeavor Content. It was formed in 2017 and is a distributor of the show ""Killing Eve,"" as well as a producer of an epic drama coming from Apple TV Plus called ""See."" C.A.A. also has an affiliate: Wiip. It is a producer of ""Dickinson,"" a comedy series that is also part of the Apple rollout scheduled for the fall. United Talent Agency is also getting in on production, with an affiliate called Civic Center Media. It has teamed up with M.R.C., the producer of ""House of Cards,"" to make new shows. The agencies have argued that these affiliates are artist-friendly studios that will help writers, because they add to the number of potential buyers -- which means more competition for writers' services and bigger paychecks. The writers have said that agencies have a conflict of interest when they act as studios. How, they ask, can an agent represent you and also be your boss? Have the agencies considered getting out of the production business? Nope. They offered to meet with the writers unions four times a year in an effort to demonstrate that the affiliated studios were benefiting their members. The W.G.A. called this arrangement ""unacceptable."" What does all this have to do with Peak TV? With the rise of streaming, there are more shows than ever before, a phenomenon often called Peak TV. Writers say their pay has not reflected the boom. Weekly earnings for television writers declined 23 percent between 2014 and 2016, according to W.G.A. figures. And pay on a per-episode basis, when adjusted for inflation, has also declined since the 1990s, the W.G.A. said. The agencies have questioned the W.G.A.'s calculations. An analysis by William Morris Endeavor determined that compensation for its writers went up by an average of 9 percent each year between 2016 and 2018.

The agents have conceded that Peak TV may have its downsides -- but only because studios and streaming services are getting more powerful. In this atmosphere, the agents argue that their services are needed more than ever. Nobody knows. The agencies may wait to see if the writers fracture in the days to come. Likewise, the writers may wait to see if more agencies cave and sign the new code of conduct. Other than the minor agencies that have signed the code and the small number of W.G.A. members who voted against the idea of firing their agents, each side has presented a united front. Many bystanders -- producers, studio executives -- expect the W.G.A. to file a lawsuit and let the courts decide who is right and who is wrong.","Talks broke down on Friday, upending a way of doing business that had been in place for decades.

To Munch: Not the Usual Super Bowl Snack

Instead of the inevitable chicken wings, treat your Super Bowl guests to crackling chicken skin snacks. Ken Oringer, a chef and owner of Toro on the edge of Chelsea, bakes the skin until crisp and spreads it with Spanish pimento cheese for little bocadillo sandwiches. To make them at home, place pieces of chicken skin seasoned with salt and pepper atop a layer of parchment on a rimmed sheet pan, cover with more parchment and weigh down with another pan. Bake for about 50 minutes at 325 degrees until golden brown. Drain on paper towels and cut into two-inch squares. I used the skin from eight chicken thighs, which gave me 32 nicely uniform pieces of crisp skin, and froze the thighs for future use. I set up two pans on two oven racks, reversing them halfway through the baking. The skin shrinks during the baking. I left my sandwiches open-faced, which Mr. Oringer endorsed, and topped some with blue cheese softened with mayonnaise garnished with a morsel of celery as a nod to those wings.

Global Business,Bank of England Ties Interest Rate to Employment,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/business/global/bank-of-england-ties-interest-rate-to-employment.html,"LONDON -- In a significant shift in strategy intended to spur Britain's economic recovery, the Bank of England said Wednesday that it would aim to keep interest rates at a record low until the nation's unemployment rate declines to at least 7 percent. By linking future rate decisions directly to the jobless rate, the Bank of England's new governor, Mark J. Carney, broke with tradition and aligned the bank more closely with the Federal Reserve's policy of providing more clarity about its intentions. Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, hs also recently moved to reassure markets by saying the institution would not raise its benchmark interest rates for some time. Short of pumping more money into economies that are still struggling to recover, central bankers in Europe have been seeking new ways to encourage banks to lend and to increase confidence among companies and consumers. Mr. Carney, who took over at the Bank of England last month, said linking interest-rate policy to unemployment was intended to reduce uncertainty. The British Chambers of Commerce said that companies would get a ""much-needed confidence boost when looking to invest, as they know that any plans will not suddenly be derailed by a hike in interest rates.''

But some experts were more skeptical. ""It's all fine now, but the problem is it gives potentially rise to unforeseen uncertainty when circumstances change,"" said Simon Hayes, an economist at Barclays. Mr. Carney is borrowing a strategy from his own playbook. In 2009, in his previous role as governor of the Bank of Canada, he committed to keeping interest rates stable for an extended period to help the country weather the financial crisis. That decision greatly impressed Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, who hired Mr. Carney for the top job at the Bank of England, where the hope is that providing similar guidance to the markets will give the British economy a much-needed lift. The step represents a major change for the Bank of England, which under Mr. Carney's predecessor, Mervyn A. King, rarely shared any insights into the thinking of the central bank's rate-setting committee ahead of its decisions. The Fed, in contrast, has been more open. Its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has signaled that the bank's policy of buying $85 billion a month in government bonds and mortgage-backed securities to spur the economy would be wound down when unemployment fell to about 7 percent. On Friday, the Labor Department reported that unemployment in July fell to 7.4 percent, from 7.6 percent in June. But unlike the Bank of England, the Fed's mandate includes not only controlling inflation but also minimizing unemployment. Still, the Bank of England's shift in strategy hardly surprised economists and investors, who have been waiting for Mr. Carney to put his stamp of authority on the British central bank. After an initial drop against the dollar after Mr. Carney's announcement, the pound recovered and continued to strengthen Wednesday, rising against the euro as well. The FTSE 100 share index fell slightly, mostly because of the Bank of England's forecast for a slow economic recovery.

Under its new strategy, the Bank of England said it did not intend to increase interest rates, currently at 0.5 percent, until the unemployment rate declined to at least 7 percent, from the current level of 7.8 percent. The central bank also forecast that unemployment might not reach that level until at least the third quarter of 2016, suggesting that rates could remain unchanged for another three years.

Mr. Carney noted that the unemployment benchmark should be seen as a ""way station"" at which the Bank of England would begin to reassess its policy, not a target that would automatically trigger a change in interest rates. The Bank of England selected the unemployment rate as a barometer, he said, because it wanted a figure that was ""widely understood and widely available."" Peter Spencer, an economic adviser at Ernst & Young's Item Club, an economic forecasting group, said the new strategy would be helpful because Britain's ""economy is in recovery rather than remission, and this guidance gives the bank the flexibility to reduce the risk of relapse.""

* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations. Colin Edwards, an economist at the Center for Economics and Business Research, a forecasting firm based in London, questioned what the central bank would do if inflation started to gather speed but unemployment barely moved. Philip Booth, a director at the Institute of Economic Affairs, a study group, was more outspoken, calling the new strategy ""the most dangerous development in U.K. monetary policy since the late 1980s."" ""To use monetary policy to reduce unemployment when inflation is already above target is playing with fire,"" Mr. Booth said.

Mr. Carney said the strategy did not mean the Bank of England would abandon its primary objective of holding inflation to around 2 percent. In a letter to Mr. Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, in which he explained the new approach, Mr. Carney wrote that forward guidance ""will further enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy so that it fully plays its part in securing a sustainable recovery over the medium term.'' Giving such guidance ""reduces uncertainty because there can be a premature view of withdrawal of stimulus as the recovery builds up,'' Mr. Carney wrote. Under Mr. King, the Bank of England injected money into the economy by buying PS375 billion, or $581 billion, in assets, mainly government bonds. The ""biggest concern,"" Mr. Carney wrote, was that some positive economic data would give rise to premature expectations that the bank would withdraw the stimulus. After closely avoiding a triple-dip recession earlier this year, the British economy has started to show some signs of improvement. Consumer confidence has recovered and the value of homes has risen. Some economists have predicted that growth will gather speed over the rest of the year. Mr. Carney cautioned, however, that while there was ""understandable relief that the U.K. economy has begun growing again,'' there ""should be little satisfaction.'' ""This is the slowest recovery in output on record,"" he said.",The Bank of England said Wednesday that it planned to keep interest rates at a record low until unemployment falls to at least 7 percent.,180bc7eb-8e0a-5ebc-9e04-c9df7abd2cb3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/08/business/08pound/08pound-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=410&w=600&s=8ec1b9faeedb313f06ac3a159932adb98e6d0de0d8c52ea6aba12dcf1f94bc62&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"The Bank of England said it did not plan to increase interest rates, currently at 0.5 percent, until the unemployment rate declined to at least 7 percent from the current level of 7.8 percent.",180bc7eb-8e0a-5ebc-9e04-c9df7abd2cb3,N24News/imgs/180bc7eb-8e0a-5ebc-9e04-c9df7abd2cb3.jpg,24
Fashion & Style,They Married at City Hall (But Didn't Toss the Bouquet),https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/fashion/weddings/they-married-at-city-hall-but-didnt-toss-the-bouquet.html,"Latasha McMickle, 41, dressed in a black shirt and black jeans, strutted down the two-block length of the Manhattan Marriage Bureau in New York as if she were in a fashion show. The stone-tiled floor was her runway. Brides, grooms and their family and friends, who sat on the faux lime green leather banquettes, became her spectators. A red rose bouquet was in one hand; a blue marriage certificate folder in her other. Last May, the CityStore at the Bureau, where 300-plus ceremonies, often called City Hall weddings, are performed weekly, switched from selling real flowers to renting silk and synthetic arrangements of sunflowers, white roses and calla lilies, among others. Ms. McMickle is one of three salespeople who help showcase them. ""We used the same flower vendor for eight years, but he closed down his business. Wedding season was approaching and we needed to have an offering for the brides,"" said Dana Rosario, 42, the director of CityStores, which operates from 141 Worth Street. Since its inception, more than 900 couples have rented bouquets, each costing $6 per hour. Before the holidays, the shop was averaging approximately 35 rentals per week. During the holiday season that number increased to 20-plus a day.

Almost instantly people inquired about purchasing them. With an investment of less than $200, and in one day, Ms. Rosario replicated the originals, offering a total of 18 bouquets. Some, like the red roses, are duplicates. Each offers eight to 10 flowers. ""People were captivated by them,"" she added. ""Not everyone likes flowers or can afford a $40 bouquet. These become the bouquet they didn't know they wanted until they hold it. It's rewarding to know we offer something that becomes a lasting memory."" To date, only one bouquet has gone home with someone, ""And one bride tossed hers in the air after getting married and it landed in a chandelier,"" Ms. Rosario said. ""But we got it down.""

Neither Ms. Hernandez nor Mr. Bell had expected to meet anyone significant in 2015, when each was invited to a friend's barbecue in Los Cabos, Mexico. ""Jeremy was standing by the beers talking with friends,"" she recalled. ""My friend told me to go over and speak to him."" Ms. Hernandez asked him if she could have a beer. ""He said yes, then he went back to talking with his friends, so I walked away."" Mr. Bell, who realized he might have appeared impolite, tried to talk with Ms. Hernandez again. This time things went better. They spoke until 4 a.m. ""Jeremy was interesting and funny. He had opinions and was smart,"" she said. ""I liked him a lot."" Their first date was a week later on Valentine's Day. Again they talked into the early morning. Additional dates followed. In August, Ms. Hernandez moved to New York to pursue a career as a professional dancer; Mr. Bell went to Nevada to attend college. ""We were Skyping once or twice a month, but it wasn't a relationship,"" she said. ""Neither of us were ready to be serious. I wanted to be with him, but he didn't know what he wanted to do with his life. He needed to find himself.""

Ms. Hernandez got a job as a nanny and joined a dance troupe; Mr. Bell left college and began construction work. Two years went by. Neither forgot about the other, and neither lost hope of rekindling their connection. In March 2017, Ms. Hernandez had enough of the dating scene in New York. She missed Mr. Bell and invited him to visit. He agreed. ""I thought about him all the time,"" she said. ""We liked each other and never had the chance to really give it a try."" Mr. Bell felt similarly. He stayed for five days and discovered a passion for New York, and for Ms. Hernandez. When he returned home, he quit his job, sold his truck and moved to Brooklyn to join Ms. Hernandez, where they currently live. Things were not easy. He attended community college, but he couldn't find work. Ms. Hernandez carried the financial responsibilities. Their relationship became strained. ""I made the commitment to love him,"" she said. ""He can be tough. We are not always on the same level. But we never gave up.""

Ms. Sascau met Edgardo Gallardo, also 39, on a Norwegian Cruise Line in 2011 where both had jobs. She is from Romania; he is from Mexico. That summer ""Swan Lake"" was performing in St. Petersburg, Russia, one of the locations where the boat was docking. Ms. Sascau wanted to see it. She told a co-worker to invite other staffers. When she passed by Mr. Gallardo, who was seated with his colleagues, she thought he had already been told about the event, and said, ""You're going, right?"" Mr. Gallardo was not originally attending. He thought Ms. Sascau was asking him out, and so he accepted. After the performance, the group went for dinner and drinks. ""I thought he was nice, but I didn't think I would marry him,"" she said. ""He was very quiet, serious and confident."" Mr. Gallardo liked her, and continued to ask her out. Other dates followed. Yet Ms. Sascau didn't hold much stock in cruise romances. ""It's a fairy tale while you're on the ship; it's different when you're back on land,"" she said. ""You're here for a few months, then you go home. Then you're on a different ship when you come back. Relationships don't really last.""

Still, they stayed in touch. When she invited him to travel with her as her guest during her next stint, as he was not working during those months, he agreed. They had a great time. But their next job found them on different ships. ""That's when it kicked in, I missed him,"" she said. ""When you're separated you either fight harder or you give up."" When Ms. Sascau's father became ill and then passed away, that's when they grew closer. They Facetimed, texted and called each other constantly. ""I felt a lot of support,"" she said. ""He sent me letters and postcards. I felt he was very special."" In 2012 they found themselves working on the same ship, again. At the time, she was an excursions manager; he was chief officer. Their relationship continued to grow. In the summer of 2013 the couple bought a home in the suburbs of Bucharest, Romania, and Mr. Gallardo bought a ring. A year later, while on a puddle jumper in Alaska, one of Ms. Sascau's favorite places, he proposed. Ms. Sascau quickly said yes.

""I'M ALLERGIC TO flowers,"" said Jazmine Parham, 25 who was seated next to her fiance, Sean Kovach, 26. ""Everyone mentioned I should have flowers. I saw the stand and I thought, 'Well, if I can get some that would be nice.' It completes the outfit and the idea of what a wedding should be. And they're pretty. It's a good option to have. And it's convenient."" Her parents, aunt, cousin, and Mr. Kovach's mother were waiting with the couple. The pair met randomly on Plenty of Fish, an online dating site, in 2016, and quickly began texting. Two weeks later, Ms. Parham, who was feeling lazy, wanted a ride to the mall to buy a Mother's Day gift. Mr. Kovach, who lived only 10 minutes away from her in Newark, volunteered to drive her. ""I was a little nervous. I remember thinking, 'I hope you're not an ax murderer. I hope we don't end up arguing and he leaves me stranded,'"" she said. ""But once we started talking it was like we had known each other our whole lives."" Actually, they sort of did. They discovered they had gone to the same grade school, and as children, lived a block away from each other. Mr. Kovach turned out not to be involved with axes in any way, and Ms. Parham was having such a good time she created an extra item she ""needed"" so they could continue shopping.

""When he drove me home, we sat outside my house in his car and just talked for hours -- neither one of us wanted to part ways,"" she said. They became closer over the next several months. There were phone calls, dates and introductions to one another's families. In September, Ms. Parham helped Mr. Kovach celebrate his 24th birthday. ""I took him and my cousin to Red Lobster, his favorite place, and bought him some video games -- we're both fanatics -- and some sweaters. He was so touched, he teared up, and that really touched me,"" she said. ""I really felt appreciated. It was our first major thing together that we celebrated. I always found myself in past relationships where you give and it's not respected or appreciated. This is someone who recognized me and what I was giving."" When Mr. Kovach used the restroom, Ms. Parham told her cousin she was going to marry him. ""It's like we're the same person,"" the bride said. ""I've never had anything come together so organically with another person."" The marriage was somewhat spur of the moment. Mr. Kovach proposed spontaneously in Atlantic City on the boardwalk over the summer. ""We would have gotten married next June, but I'm pregnant and that's when I'm due,"" said the bride, who now uses the surname Parham-Kovach. ""We wanted to be married once the baby got here. I wish I had a traditional wedding. My grandmother and sister aren't here. But the experience is still special. I never saw myself getting married. I never planned a wedding in my mind. This is the next best thing.""","Three couples share their stories after marrying on a December day at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau, where the brides also rented their flowers.",02b2a44f-b018-5a7c-9dd1-9fe94f7b76f9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/06/fashion/weddings/06VOWS1/06VOWS1-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=22a7f9b7065294d91aaa9f001971fe4bb8e63aaab03dc4d10e94f57890c622d2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jazmine Parham and Sean Kovach share a kiss after Angel L.

Art & Design,Anselm Kiefer Sculpture Will Go Up at Rockefeller Center,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/arts/design/anselm-kiefer-sculpture-rockefeller-center.html,"Anselm Kiefer, the German artist known for his monumental paintings and installations layering history, culture, religion and mythology, will create his first ever site-specific outdoor public sculpture in the United States this spring at Rockefeller Center in New York.

Science,Just a Fainting Spell? Or Is Betelgeuse About to Blow?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/science/astronomy-supernova-betelgeuse.html,"Is Betelgeuse about to blow?

Probably not, but astronomers are having fun thinking about it.

Over the last three months, the star, which marks the armpit of Orion the hunter, has mysteriously dimmed to less than half its normal brightness, markedly altering one of the great sights of the winter sky.

At the beginning of January the star was fainter than ever before observed, according to Edward Guinan of Villanova University, who has been compiling data on Betelgeuse. In its ""fainting"" spell, Dr. Guinan said, the star has dropped from seventh to twenty-first on the list of brightest stars in the sky. But even so dimmed, Betelgeuse is still too bright to be easily observed and measured by large professional telescopes -- at least not without damaging sensors that were designed to wring every faint photon from the blackness of space.

Rebecca Oppenheimer, an astrophysicist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, said she had managed to observe Betelgeuse with the 200-inch telescope at Palomar Observatory in California last week, but it had left an afterimage that put their detector out of service for a day. The next time around, she said in an email, they plan to cover part of the giant mirror, to cut down on the amount of light it receives.

""Ha ha, kind of ridiculous,"" she wrote. ""But, well, the science must go on!""

Last week Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York, circulated a request for amateur astronomers to observe and monitor Betelgeuse's brightness.",A familiar star in the constellation Orion has dimmed noticeably since October.

Style,The Comforts of Clutter,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/17/style/the-comforts-of-clutter.html,"Except for my writing desk, where books, manuscripts, index cards and journals are piled in random fashion, I have always disliked clutter. I grew up in a large, chaotic household; at any time of day or night, someone was entertaining a friend or watching television or fixing a snack or hammering at a woodworking project. The bubbles of activity generated a lot of clutter, which I associated with noise and turbulence. So when I moved out of my parents' house, I sought out quiet, spare spaces.

This impulse, it turned out, is well-suited for the immigrant's life. Over the last 30 years, I have lived in a dozen homes in London, Casablanca and Los Angeles, in rented rooms and attic apartments and rambling houses with huge basements. The homes grew or shrank depending on the amount of money in my bank account, my personal entanglements, and my creative or scholarly work, but into and from each of these places I've also carried objects that are meaningful to me, markers of a life lived in between countries and cultures.

The accumulation started with small items, whether practical or sentimental, that could fit into the single suitcase I packed when I left home: family photographs; a pair of Moroccan slippers; a hot water bottle; a plaster pot I made in the second grade; my collection of paperbacks from Heinemann's African Writers Series; a folder filled with every official document I might ever need in order to keep my student visa in good standing.

Over time, the collection grew to include more intimate or more valuable pieces that required careful handling. On my dresser, for instance, I keep my grandmother's beaded choker, adorned in her tribe's idiosyncratic patterns; a silver khamsa necklace my mother brought for me on one of her visits; a gold chain with a pearl pendant my sister gave me as a gift the year I graduated from college. Each time I wear one of these pieces, I'm reminded that I come from a long line of powerful women, who've met and survived struggles far bigger than my own.

Because I'm a writer, I've been particularly drawn to objects that connect me to family stories: My grandfather's prayer beads, made of polished cedar wood, sit in a bowl on my desk. In moments of anxiety, it soothes me to touch something that I know he touched nearly a century ago. His military discharge certificate, which lists the dates of his service in the French Army during World War I, also hangs on a wall in my office. (I drew inspiration from imagining him on horseback, trudging through unfamiliar territory, as I worked on a historical novel.)

Photographs and family documents are my weakness. Whenever I travel back to Morocco, I ask for photo albums and go through archives, which I scan on my phone or copy into my notebook. I realized a while back that my attachment to these material things was an attempt to hold on to a past from which I feared drifting. A portable history, in the form of family heirlooms or cultural objects, is a balm for the itinerant life of an immigrant.

A few years ago, when my mother wanted to toss out her old coffee and sugar canisters, I held on to them, too. By this time, I had become a mother myself and had given up all hope of avoiding clutter. The tchotchkes I carried from home to home had multiplied: damascene pill boxes, wood coasters, miniature tagines, antique rugs, textiles of all kinds.

Global Business,A Promise to Protect Pensions Will Test Greece's Red Line on Austerity,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/business/global/testing-greeces-red-line-on-austerity.html,"ATHENS -- With a fresh inspection by Greece's foreign creditors looming next week and labor unions leading a new wave of strikes, the government here has drawn a red line: it will keep pushing economic reforms but vows to impose no more austerity measures on Greeks already battered from three years of tax increases and pension cuts. That could prove a hard promise to keep. There is an estimated shortfall of 2.5 billion euros, or $3.3 billion, in the country's social security funds for the year. And Greece is peering into an even larger chasm, an 11 billion euro financing gap that its international creditors have said the country will face as its debt payments come due over the next two years. A third foreign bailout, on top of the total 240 billion euro in bailouts given to Greece since 2010, is now assumed to be necessary. No wonder Greek trade unions and labor experts are warning that, despite the supposed red line, further pension cuts are likely. The concerns brought thousands of Greeks to the streets of Athens on Wednesday, calling attention to a two-day strike by civil servants, whose salaries and pensions have already been cut by 30 percent over the last three years. The strike was called to protest the government's plans for thousands of forced transfers and layoffs in the Civil Service, but fears about pensions were in the air.

""Just let them try and cut our pensions again,"" said Maria Vassilopoulou, a 45-year-old nurse taking part in the protest. ""They'll have a riot on their hands."" The Greek labor minister, Yiannis Vroutsis, denied over the weekend that pensions would be withheld or cut. ""I want to reassure people that their pensions will not be touched,"" he said. ""Families can make their plans feeling safe and secure."" But retirees are on edge. Stathis Meltakis, a 65-year-old car mechanic who retired this year, has been counting on a monthly payment of 850 euros from the country's biggest pension fund for private sector workers, IKA, which provides health coverage to 5.5 million people and pensions to more than 800,000. But last week, the union representing IKA workers warned of cuts of 10 to 30 percent in pensions next year. ""I've no idea when I'll get it or how long the checks will keep coming,"" Mr. Meltakis said. ""You can't be sure of anything anymore."" With Greece still not meeting the financial targets set by its international creditors, labor unions and economists worry that public pensions and state social security spending, which this year will total 18 billion euros, could be reduced again.

""Basically, the pension system is collapsing,"" said Savas Robolis, a prominent Greek labor economist who leads the research institute of the private workers' union, the General Confederation of Greek Workers. He said that the funds' decline was long in the making, after years of mismanagement, but that the country's debt crisis dealt the final blow. With unemployment at a record 28 percent, fewer workers are paying into the funds, which have been sapped, too, by the early retirements of thousands of civil servants scrambling to escape forced transfers and layoffs.
* Open or closed on Thanksgiving? Here are stores' plans for Thursday and Friday. Mr. Robolis's report called for growth-enhancing measures to increase the size of the Greek work force. Currently, only one Greek works for every two who do not. He also warned of the need to find ways of bolstering social security revenue. Of immediate concern is how to plug the social security funds' estimated deficit for this year of 2.5 billion euros. Unlike the country's banks, Greece's pension funds were not recapitalized after a 50 percent write-down of private Greek debt last year, part of the country's second bailout. The funds, as a result, came out of the bailout with a loss of 12 billion euros. Debts owed to IKA -- mostly by employers delinquent on their social security contributions -- ballooned to 8 billion euros, from 4.8 billion euros in 2010, the union representing IKA workers said. The union's warning was followed by reports in the Greek media that IKA borrowed 150 million euros from the state to pay pensions in October. Mr. Vroutsis, the labor minister, acknowledged over the summer that the country's pension system was ""not viable"" and ""in need of a fundamental overhaul."" Among the proposed measures is the creation of an electronic system for employers to declare their contributions. An estimated half-million self-employed Greeks are thought to be illegally avoiding their obligation to pay into the system.

At the same time, a crackdown on social security fraud -- a problem considered as pernicious as the country's widespread tax evasion -- has seen some results. A unified payment system started operating in June and identified at least 50,000 false claimants, many of whom had been collecting the pensions of dead relatives for years. ""In a short period of time, we managed to put sturdy foundations in an old and rotten structure,"" the Labor Ministry's general secretary, Panagiotis Kokkoris, said. While larger countries in the euro zone with debt problems, including Spain and Italy, have also cut benefits, the impact of the changes has been less acute than in Greece, where three years of austerity measures have deepened a recession and brought political and social upheaval. The Greek pension problem is expected to be on the agenda next week when officials from the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund meet in Athens. Other points of discussion are expected to include additional forced transfers and layoffs in the Civil Service, lagging tax collection and a slow-moving privatization drive. Hanging over the meetings is that 11 billion euro funding gap, which could necessitate another bailout, albeit one much smaller than the previous two. Despite the bleak numbers, Greece is predicting a primary surplus -- revenue not counting debt payments for this year -- chiefly because of a boom in tourism. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras pledged last week to give 70 percent of any surplus to pensioners on low incomes, but political opponents accused him of making false promises. Already, pressure is building on Mr. Samaras's fragile coalition government. Teachers, hospital staff and other civil servants, as well as lawyers, are on strike this week. ""Pensions are the easy target,"" said Mahi Triantafyllou, a 58-year-old high-school teacher, at one protest. ""They'll hit us again.""","Greece has pledged to make no further cuts to its disgruntled citizens' pensions, but a gaping hole in its finances may force its hand.",0969bf17-30e4-5108-b5ca-de960eddf590,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/19/business/Greekpension/Greekpension-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=368&w=600&s=848d0dca2c4c0551e703cf6492a999a7da49a248d667385ca4a7bd47d42d14aa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Teachers in Athens protested against job cuts and other austerity measures on Wednesday.,0969bf17-30e4-5108-b5ca-de960eddf590,N24News/imgs/0969bf17-30e4-5108-b5ca-de960eddf590.jpg,24
Books,The Screams of a Silent Movie Echo Through the Years,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/books/review/dominic-smith-electric-hotel.html,"The world of silent film is largely a vanished one. In an author's note at the start of his radiant new novel, ""The Electric Hotel,"" Dominic Smith tells us that, thanks in part to the fragility of celluloid nitrate, more than 75 percent of all silent films have been lost. Maybe that's why the silents we do have -- particularly the early, pre-1920s ones -- can seem like missives from an aboveground Atlantis, satin-silver remnants of a civilization that's alluringly alien yet also recognizably human. Watching an early silent can feel like peering into another person's dream.

Smith captures that spirit, and more, in ""The Electric Hotel,"" a vital and highly entertaining work about the act of creation, and about what it means to pick up and move on after you've lost everything. The story weaves through the streets of Paris and across the wild landscape of Australia, and even traverses the Belgian battlefields of World War I. But it begins and ends in early-1960s Hollywood, where we meet Claude Ballard, an elderly former filmmaker with the emphasis on former: Though he wanders through the city with two small cameras in tow -- one for stills and another for movies -- he hasn't made a feature film since 1910. That one, ""The Electric Hotel,"" an ambitious and fantastical hourlong melodrama, nearly killed him.

Although a film student named Martin Embry finds Claude in Hollywood, the bulk of this story takes place in and around Fort Lee, N.J., the true birthplace of American cinema. It's there that Claude, a Frenchman who received his early training from the pioneering Lumiere brothers, joins with three partners to create a small studio: There's Hal Bender, a Brooklyn theater owner whose beloved father was murdered by thuggish moneylenders; the Australian stuntman Chip Spalding, ""a teenage daredevil in a loincloth""; and the haughty but complex French actress Sabine Montrose, who makes the shift from stage to film at Claude's urging -- and who, in the process, also becomes his undoing. When the elderly Claude is asked about her, his answer, after a pause, is this: ""Well, let's see. ... Ah, I remember: She ate my entrails like a feral dog and then she vanished into thin air.""","Dominic Smith's novel ""The Electric Hotel"" unveils the tragic history of a film that undid its maker — and his love for its temperamental star.",7ce86614-b979-5692-8cec-878c18a06358,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/21/books/review/Zacharek01/Zacharek01-facebookJumbo.png?year=2019&h=393&w=751&s=df8d65ccc8cee7ceba7ebf8d8c3f9e9baa38130088681fbed2b5f578b670884d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dominic Smith, author of ""The Electric Hotel.""",7ce86614-b979-5692-8cec-878c18a06358,N24News/imgs/7ce86614-b979-5692-8cec-878c18a06358.jpg,13
Science,Risky Rats Give Clues on Brain Circuitry Behind Taking a Chance,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/24/science/risky-rats-help-shine-light-on-brain-circuitry-behind-taking-a-chance.html,"When people make risky decisions, like doubling down in blackjack or investing in volatile stocks, what happens in the brain? Scientists have long tried to understand what makes some people risk-averse and others risk-taking. Answers could have implications for how to treat, curb or prevent destructively risky behavior, like pathological gambling or drug addiction. Now, a study by Dr. Karl Deisseroth, a prominent Stanford neuroscientist and psychiatrist, and his colleagues gives some clues. The study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, reports that a specific type of neuron or nerve cell, in a certain brain region helps galvanize whether or not a risky choice is made. The study was conducted in rats, but experts said it built on research suggesting the findings could be similar in humans. If so, they said, it could inform approaches to addiction, which involves some of the same neurons and brain areas, as well as treatments for Parkinson's disease because one class of Parkinson's medications turns some patients into problem gamblers.

In a series of experiments led by Kelly Zalocusky, a doctoral student, researchers found that a risk-averse rat made decisions based on whether its previous choice involved a loss (in this case, of food). Rats whose previous decision netted them less food were prompted to behave conservatively next time by signals from certain receptors in a brain region called the nucleus accumbens, the scientists discovered. These receptors, which are proteins attached to neurons, are part of the dopamine system, a neurochemical important to emotion, movement and thinking. In risk-taking rats, however, those receptors sent a much fainter signal, so the rats kept making high-stakes choices even if they lost out. But by employing optogenetics, a technique that uses light to manipulate neurons, the scientists stimulated brain cells with those receptors, heightening the ""loss"" signal and turning risky rats into safer rats. ""We know from other work that this is all relevant to human addiction and gambling,"" said Trevor Robbins, the chairman of the psychology department at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the new research. ""This study has zeroed in on the area precisely where this occurs. They've tried to show that not having this signal biases you toward risky judgments in the future, and they've done a lovely job on that."" Step by step, the researchers built evidence that neurons with a dopamine receptor called D2 in the nucleus accumbens, a region integral to brain reward circuitry, play a critical role in risky-or-not decision-making. Strikingly, they found they could alter the message those neurons send. Rats were given a choice of two food levers. One released a consistent amount of sucrose each time; the other often delivered a tiny amount, but in 25 percent of presses, it unleashed a delicious sucrose flood. Over time, both levers gave the same quantity, so rats did not go hungry and their choices came down to whether or not they were gamblers.

Risky rats gambled on the iffier lever more than half the time. Risk-averse rats were strongly influenced by their last choice; if they picked the risky lever and received a trickle, they picked the consistent lever next time. ""Some are very sensitive to losing, and if they take a risky option and lose, they're very likely to not go back to it again,"" said Paul Phillips, a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of Washington and a co-author of a commentary about the study. ""That's very common in human behavior. An analogy is a slot machine in Vegas."" To identify the brain location involved in these decisions, the researchers gave rats a drug used to treat Parkinson's disease, pramipexole, marketed as Mirapex, which acts on D2 receptors and seems to dampen some patients' ability to restrain risk-seeking behavior. Risk-averse rats receiving pramipexole turned into risk-taking rats, but the drug had much greater effects when piped directly into the nucleus accumbens than when it was administered to another brain area researchers had thought might be involved. The scientists used a technique Dr. Deisseroth helped invent fiber photometry, which uses light particles to track activity of neurons tagged with certain proteins. They found that neurons in the nucleus accumbens with D2 receptors transmitted a signal when rats were making their decisions. That signal was much larger if the choice the rat had made had just had been a loser, yielding just a dribble of sucrose. The signal only spiked in non-risky rats, however; it was negligible in rats that always gambled for the sucrose windfall. So, what to do with those risky rats? Using optogenetics, which Dr. Deisseroth also helped develop, the team stimulated nucleus accumbens neurons with D2 receptors at the very moment of the fateful food-lever decision. That caused the receptors to send strong loss signals to the rats, apparently making them weigh recent losses more heavily, and prompting them to play it safe with their next lever choice. ""It turns out you can explain a large part of whether rats were risky or not by this particular signal at this particular time,"" Dr. Deisseroth said. ""We saw it happen, and then we were able to provide that signal, and then see that we could drive the behavior causally.""

Human brains are more complex, of course, and ""are not only affected by immediate recent losses,"" Dr. Deisseroth said, but ""your appetite for risk in many circumstances might be at least possibly reducible to what a particular set of cells in a particular brain area is doing."" Dr. Robbins said that might yield insights for drug addiction, since it ""clearly involves the dopamine system and these areas of the brain,"" and in addicts, as in risky rats, the same receptors produce weaker signals. For Parkinson's patients, if versions of drugs like pramipexole could be developed to skip the nucleus accumbens and focus on brain areas responsible for movement, ""it would be a much more effective therapy,"" Dr. Phillips said. ""It's because it gets to the nucleus accumbens that it has this gambling effect."" He added, ""Now, not only do we know the part of the brain, but we know the particular cells in the brain, and we know that if you manipulate them you can change the behavior."" Dr. Deisseroth said optogenetic manipulation is too invasive to be done in humans, but findings from optogenetic studies in animals are now being used to identify brain areas to target with noninvasive brain stimulation for problems like cocaine addiction. Finding the roots of risk in the brain also ""helps us understand what might be making people different in terms of their risk appetites,"" he said. ""It may help us see them differently, maybe in a more tolerant way, to realize that there's a real biological basis for their behavior.""",A new study found that a specific type of neuron in a certain brain region helps galvanize whether or not a risky choice is made.,04985629-20c0-5a9c-bf9f-5e87e37d96a3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/24/science/24RISKYRATS/24RISKYRATS-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=376&w=718&s=cff3eed3fd44a8b96e4250f8e812cd11543c37c4cb2b4db7f45c78fc030ccc54&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A rat like the participants in an experiment to measure risk-taking.

Art & Design,XX Marks the Spot: KAWS Goes Global,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/arts/design/kaws-auctions.html,"The artist and designer Brian Donnelly, known professionally as KAWS, in his Williamsburg studio with assistants working on an upcoming show of abstractions for London.





Many art careers are made from the top down: A museum show typically provides the seal of approval that propels a young artist to success in the commercial world. But KAWS -- the nom-d'art of Brian Donnelly -- took another direction. He became a popular juggernaut thanks to the simple, graphic and recognizable characters he invented -- like ""Companion,"" his version of Mickey Mouse -- that riff on famous cartoon figures and have XXs for eyes. First he sketched them, then he inserted them, illegally, into the sides of phone booths, and soon they became the staples of toys, T-shirts and commercial collaboration of all stripes, giving him 1.9 million followers on Instagram. Mr. Donnelly had a streetwear store in Tokyo, OriginalFake (2006-13), before he ever had a solo museum show.

[This week, contemporary art sales brought in $981 million, led by Jeff Koons and KAWS] Only in the last few years has his renown translated into institutional recognition, but it will be 2021 before he finally has his first New York star turn in a survey at the Brooklyn Museum . He's already earning big auction prices, however, like the $14.8 million paid at Sotheby's Hong Kong in March for his painting ""The KAWS Album"" (2005), a mash-up of ""The Simpsons"" and the cover of ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" It was a record for his work -- almost 20 times the low estimate -- and it stopped many experts in their tracks.

""My trajectory has been from the bottom up,"" the 44-year-old artist said last month , sitting in his well-appointed Williamsburg studio, one of two he operates in Brooklyn. And the easygoing artist seemed fine with that. Mr. Donnelly -- a former graffiti tagger who grew up taking the PATH train into the city from his hometown, Jersey City, to hang out at Canal Jeans -- created the name KAWS to ""live vicariously through the work,"" he said, adding, ""I don't feel any need to create attention for myself."" That may be difficult after this week, when four of his paintings are coming up for bid during the spring evening auction sales, offering his take on the Smurfs, SpongeBob SquarePants and Snoopy. On Wednesday, Christie's Post-War and Contemporary auction featured ""Kurfs (Tangle)"" from 2009; the work sold for $2.6 million, well over its high estimate of $800,000. On Thursday Sotheby's offered ""Kurf (Hot Dog)"" from 2008, which sold for $2.6 million, over its high estimate of $2 million. Also on Thursday Phillips sold ""The Walk Home"" from 2012 for $5.9 million, well over its high estimate of $800,000 and ""Untitled (MBFU9)"" from 2015 for $1.3 million, well over its high estimate of $500,000. Some experts have put KAWS's work in the category of street art, which is undergoing the same transition that Pop Art made in the 1960s and 1970s.

Last year was the first time KAWS work was even included in an evening sale at the big houses, showing just how far and fast his reputation has moved. Mr. Donnelly expressed his feelings about the Hong Kong sale on Instagram: ""Do I think my work should sell for this much? No."" In an interview he noted the obvious -- artists don't see a check from an auction sale unless they consigned the work -- but he acknowledged that it adds luster to a career: ""I think you'd be kind of naive to think that it doesn't affect you in some way.""

Mr. Donnelly does not lack for ambition or activity. He has a just-opened show at the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit, ""KAWS: Alone Again,"" on view until August 4. He shows with two prestigious galleries, Perrotin and Skarstedt, and he has an ongoing collaboration called KAWS x Dior, with the French fashion house, involving sculptures for runway shows and store displays. He is surely the only artist working with both Dior and Cookie Monster; his KAWS x Sesame Street collection debuted at Uniqlo in the fall. Last month, Mr. Donnelly's studio was full of sharply delineated and brightly colored, abstract paintings in progress -- there were no cute characters in these works, but they still bear his deep influence from comics and cartoons. He favors a very thin type of paint, similar to that used for cel animation.

""I've always just really liked color,"" said Mr. Donnelly of the puzzle-like shapes he was working on. He draws the images and does a first and last paint coat himself, with middle paint layers done by assistants. ""You bring in these muted ones and it's really what gets the others to pop,"" he added. Though paintings may dominate the auction offerings this week, his three-dimensional work has brought him much renown. At the time of his Hong Kong record sale, Mr. Donnelly had a 121-foot-long inflatable sculpture, ""Companion,"" floating in the city's Victoria Harbor. The fourth in a series, organized by the Hong Kong studio AllRightsReserved, will be installed in July at Mount Fuji in Japan.

Michael Rooks, a curator at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta who put on a KAWS show in 2011--12, said that such projects are why ""KAWS has had an enormous impact on visual culture across the globe."" For their part, museums have been traditionally suspicious of things that have too much mass appeal. ""It makes the art world uncomfortable,"" said Anne Pasternak, the director of the Brooklyn Museum. ""But Brian doesn't respect those traditional hierarchies."" Ms. Pasternak took time to come around, too. ""I didn't see the appeal initially,"" she said of his work. ""But artists love him. They all said, 'Go visit him. 'And I've learned to listen to artists."" Asked if he still felt unwelcome in the high culture citadel at times, Mr. Donnelly laughed and said, ""Yeah, all the time. There's a sense that you can be a commercial artist or a fine artist, but you cannot do both.""

""I always visually gravitated toward comics, but I wasn't somebody who read every story,"" he said of his Jersey City childhood, which was much more about finding places to skateboard than see art. ""I wasn't taken to galleries."" He attended the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan and then started traveling to Japan, further embedding himself in the cartoon aesthetic. In the 1990s the KAWS name became associated with on-the-fly Manhattan street projects. ""I haven't painted illegally since about 2001,"" Mr. Donnelly said. With age came a more conventional life: He's married to an artist and has two young children. Given the toys and characters he's surrounded by at all times, ""I had to have kids just to make it not seem weird,"" Mr. Donnelly joked. In a season when he seems to have it all -- the fun of childlike pursuits plus serious auction clout and designing stores for Dior -- he made no apologies for his low-to-high success. But he did it in his soft-spoken way. ""Honestly to me, it would be weird to be an artist these days and not be working in all these spaces simultaneously,"" he said.",The artist known as KAWS is famous for his commercial collaborations.

Science,Unplanned Pregnancies Hit Lowest Level in 30 Years,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/08/science/unplanned-pregnancies-hit-lowest-level-in-30-years.html,"The rate of unintended pregnancy in the United States has declined to its lowest level in the last three decades.

The level in 2008 was 54 per 1,000 women and girls aged 15 to 44. By 2011, it was 45 per 1,000. Of the 6.1 million pregnancies in 2011, 2.8 million were unintended.

A recent analysis in The New England Journal of Medicine found variations in rates of unintended pregnancy by income, race, ethnicity, education and age. But there were declines, some quite large, in almost every demographic group.

The rate among teenagers, for example, declined by 28 percent. The rate of all income groups dropped, with the largest decrease -- 32 percent -- among people with incomes at 100 percent to 199 percent of the poverty level.","Of 6.1 million pregnancies for those 15 to 44 in the United States in 2011, only 2.8 million were unintended, representing the lowest level in three decades.",bdb80b8b-2846-5c00-bb10-3c9fdc1fc766,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/08/science/08NUMBER/08NUMBER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=969028c85abd0c526c9e08b215d26ce9bac4a904e37ee318e7c9ab504867fd85&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Pamphlets in a waiting area inside a Planned Parenthood in Queens.

Travel,Showing Off With the Hotel Flagship,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/travel/flagship-hotels.html,"The W New York in 1998 was the epitome of cool. It was the first property of the W Hotel brand, then part of Starwood, now Marriott, and boasted rooms with silver couches and mirrored ceilings. The lobby was designed to act as a lounge. The pool was called a wet deck. The presidential suite was titled an ""E WOW"" suite -- Extreme Wow. The W was the most playful hotel around. Twenty years later the brand has built shinier, more attention-grabbing flagships. One, W Dubai - The Palm, opened in February. Guests are greeted by Orsoni glass tiles that reflect the sun, and then sleep in guest rooms with walls designed to mirror the sea and Arabic lyrics written graffiti style. They eat at the celebrity chef Massimo Bottura's first restaurant outside of Italy. In the world of retail, flagship properties have always been big in every sense of the world. At Nike's in New York, visitors can design their own sneakers. At the Microsoft flagship in London, they can play the latest Xbox games in a gaming lounge.

""The flagship Apple store in New York is bigger, more modern and offers more services than the local Apple store at your mall,"" said Barak Hirschowitz, president of the International Luxury Hotel Association. ""Similarly a flagship hotel will be in the best location, is usually larger, and offers more bars, restaurants and services than other properties within the brand."" Like the W Hotels, many brands that have longstanding flagships are replacing them or creating newer siblings. The Ritz-Carlton is building a new flagship in New York City with less formal restaurants and local design elements. It will open in 2021 and most definitely steal some attention away from the old one. By the end of 2020 Crowne Plaza will introduce six flagship hotels, the brand's first. To date, the company has 426 properties and 119,494 hotel rooms across the world. In Hamburg guests will check into rooms with separate places to work, play and sleep. In Paris they will be able to browse local art on the walls of their lobby.

""These properties will elevate our entire estate,"" said Eric Lent, a senior vice president at IHG, which owns the chain. ""They give our guests a first-look at where the brand is going."" ""They represent places where we can innovate, test, and learn,"" said Mr. Lent. A few of these flagships will test out circadian lighting in guest rooms to see if it results in sounder sleep. Other brands want their flagships to be places that attract attention from key clients and investors in busy markets. Simon Naudi, the chief executive of Corinthia Hotels, decided to make its London property his flagship because of its prime location (The group has four openings in the pipeline in Dubai, Bucharest, Moscow and Brussels, so it has a lot of choices.) ""We are proud of what we have achieved in London, and we want as many people as possible to experience it,"" he said. The Corinthia London has the largest spa in London, along with a new restaurant by Tom Kerridge, a chef made famous when his pub, The Hand and Flowers, received two Michelin stars. At some of these properties guests might not even know they are staying at a flagship. They might just think they are in a darn good hotel. Of course, there are the brands that hold tight to tradition and still believe their flagship should be their original property, the place where standards were set.

Foiz Ahmed, president of Quadrum Hospitality Group, which owns Arlo Hotels, wants his new properties in Miami, Washington, D.C., and Wynwood, Fla., to take after his first property in New York's Soho neighborhood . It has trendy dining areas that change seasonally (think ski chalets in the winter and gardens in the summer). ""We're always trying to emulate what we have at our flagship, because it's proven successful,"" he said. The Hoxton, a hipster brand based in London, has new hotels in Chicago, Portland, Ore., and soon Los Angeles. Still, it tapped the Williamsburg, Brooklyn, location, the first on the North American continent, as its beacon. The brand gambled on introducing a retail store and a sprawling rooftop bar there. These ideas worked, so the location gets rewarded with the flagship status. Then there are the hotel groups that believe even the idea of a flagship goes against the current zeitgeist. Autograph Collection Hotels refuses to name a flagship property because it wants each of its hotels to stand out, the company said. ""We believe today's travelers are collecting hotels like a foodie would collect a restaurant,"" said Sarah Lipton, a senior director of global brand marketing for Autograph. ""It's hard to pick out one because it's about getting unique experiences at every single one.""","In an increasingly saturated hospitality world, flagships offer innovative designs, services and amenities.",68e53360-acf9-574a-909b-a18f20faa9a6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/01/travel/28trending-hotel/28trending-hotel-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=6fd55c99dd90d2a44c12e4548459fa437d2a45a0847953344e0bf580e9b37538&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Palm Islands of Dubai, which opened in February, is one of the new flagship hotels of the W Hotel brand.",68e53360-acf9-574a-909b-a18f20faa9a6,N24News/imgs/68e53360-acf9-574a-909b-a18f20faa9a6.jpg,4
Real Estate,"New York's New Rentals: Smaller Apartments, More Perks",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/realestate/new-yorks-new-rentals-smaller-apartments-more-perks.html,"Developers of large rental buildings have stuck to a formula over the past several years: Keep apartments small; go big on amenities. Now, with a surge of rentals coming to market, some developers are pushing this formula to the max, tweaking apartment sizes and piling on the perks. More than 13,000 new rental apartments are expected to open their doors in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens this year, according to Citi Habitats, one of the city's largest rental brokerage firms. In Manhattan, the anticipated 4,900 apartments in 34 new rental developments represent a 25 percent increase from the 2009 peak, when 3,918 rental units opened for leasing. Brooklyn will receive even more -- about 6,500 new rental units across 134 buildings in 2015, more than double last year's 2,981 units in 36 buildings. And don't forget Queens, where at least 1,800 new apartments in 18 buildings are anticipated in Long Island City this year. Many of the major new developments will have sprawling floors of amenity space, including bowling alleys, basketball courts and in-house dog runs. Some developers hope that the attention lavished on shared space will help offset another trend sweeping the rental industry, shrinking apartments.

The influx of apartments comes at a time when rents have been pushed to new limits. The average monthly rent in Manhattan reached a record $3,438 in 2014, according to Citi Habitats. Rents in fashionable Brooklyn are catching up fast, sometimes surpassing Manhattan. In December, the average monthly rent was $3,088 in Boerum Hill, $3,205 in Williamsburg and $4,237 in Dumbo, according to MNS, a brokerage firm. Despite these highs, rents overall are expected to stay relatively stable this year. ""I call it the high plateau,"" said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. The market for high-end rentals will persist, he added, because while hefty rents are often an incentive to buy, the leap to homeownership right now is complicated by tough lending standards, hefty down payments and a general lack of apartments for sale at the lower end of the market.

Facing such high rents, New Yorkers expect to be impressed. ""You can't just build a vanilla building,"" said Gary L. Malin, the president of Citi Habitats. ""Renters want to walk in and see the latest, greatest and best."" Condo-like finishes, high-end appliances, personalized services and amenities galore have become standard in large luxury rental buildings, he said. ""You can't get the pricing you want to get unless you're building that."" To one-up the competition -- and justify top rents -- landlords and developers are becoming creative. Among the most ambitious rental buildings to debut in Manhattan in 2015 is 70 Pine, a conversion of the former headquarters of the American International Group in the financial district. Pablo Enriquez for The New York Times Developed by Rose Associates, a major city landlord, and DTH Capital, the landmark Art Deco tower will have 612 rentals above a new extended-stay hotel called Q&A, with leasing to begin in the spring. In addition to a long list of amenities including a screening room in a former bank vault and a two-story La Palestra gym with a two-lane bowling alley, there will be a restaurant and lounge on the top three floors of the 66-story tower. Several outdoor terraces will offer dining with ""outrageous unimpeded views,"" said Adam R. Rose, a co-president of Rose Associates, who promised the chef would be among the city's top talents. While the space will be open to the public, only residents will be guaranteed a table. Everyone else will be seated on a first-come, first-served basis. Downstairs, the Art Deco lobby is being restored with an eye to residents and visitors alike, including a coffeehouse and a barbershop. Apartment prices haven't been released, but are expected to be similar to those at the nearby New York by Gehry building at 8 Spruce Street, where the cheapest available studio the other day on the building's website was $2,760 a month.

The biggest rental building opening in Manhattan this year will also be piling on the perks. Developed by the Moinian Group, 605 West 42nd Street will add 1,174 units to the market this spring, including 235 that are designated as affordable. To lure tenants to its Far West Side location in the Hudson Yards area, it will offer a grand lobby, lounges, a restaurant with outdoor dining, a 70,000-square-foot fitness center with indoor and outdoor pools, and a 70-foot reflecting pool, among other features. Rents will be priced at ""premium levels for the neighborhood,"" according to the developer. Brooklyn and Queens are also experiencing amenity creep, as tall towers continue to propagate inland and along the waterfronts. ""We are encouraging our clients to really put out top-of-the-line product and practical amenities packages, at times geared to get people's attention,"" said David J. Maundrell III, the founder of aptsandlofts.com.

That was the idea behind the outdoor pool at QLIC, a 421-unit rental in Long Island City developed by World Wide Group and its partners, Rabina Properties and Cammeby's International Group. The 10th-floor pool will offer stunning Manhattan skyline views, said Mr. Maundrell, who is handling leasing for the building, to begin in March. According to the building's website, the pool at QLIC is just a part of the "" 'fun factor' built into its DNA."" Among the more than 28,000 square feet of amenities are a landscaped roof deck with an outdoor theater, barbecue and dining areas, and a double-height media lounge with stadium seating and Manhattan views. In Downtown Brooklyn, AvalonBay Communities is developing an 826-unit rental complex at 100 Willoughby Street, with a dog run with separate places for small and large dogs to play and a heated pergola for owners. Nearby, the Brodsky Organization recently topped out City Tower, a 440-unit rental at 336 Flatbush Avenue Extension above the City Point retail complex. The developer expects the downstairs subway, movie theater and restaurants to be a draw for tenants.

""Think of it as a great food court downstairs with lots of Brooklyn eateries,"" said Dean Amro, a principal of the Brodsky Organization. ""We think those things will be great conveniences for our residents."" The building will also have half-court basketball, a residents' lounge, a fitness center, a rooftop terrace. There will also be a quarter-acre terrace on the 19th floor with a lawn. Leasing is expected to begin in the fall. Some developers hope that the space devoted to shared amenities will make it easier for renters to live in smaller apartments. Smaller spaces also allow developers to shrink rents accordingly. At QLIC, studios measure between 420 and 470 square feet and are expected to begin at $1,995 a month. The average rent for a studio in Long Island City in December was $2,338 a month, according to MNS. In Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 247 North 7th, a 169-unit rental developed by Adam America, will offer large alcove studios designed to ""feel like a one-bedroom,"" but renting for slightly less than a true one-bedroom, said Mr. Maundrell of aptsandlofts.com, which is handling leasing. At the same time, such ""tween studios"" or ""junior ones,"" as he calls them, allow developers to charge more than they would for a more compact studio. ""There is very little fat, so to speak,"" he said, estimating such units could go for $2,800 a month in a market where monthly rents for a typical one-bedroom start at $3,000 and a studio begins at $2,600. ""Right now, even a $50 to $100 difference in rent per month moves the needle,"" said Mr. Maundrell, who is working on a similar apartment concept at 490 Myrtle Avenue in Clinton Hill, a 93-unit rental developed by Madison Realty Capital. ""People make decisions based upon that."" The market for tiny apartments will be tested when My Micro NY debuts at 335 East 27th Street later this year with 55 prefabricated apartments of between 260 and 360 square feet, smaller than what zoning laws ordinarily allow. The 10-story building, a collaboration by Monadnock Development, Actors Fund Housing Development Corporation and nArchitects, is the fruition of a competition to design and build an apartment tower full of micro-units on city-owned land sponsored by the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development and endorsed by former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.

But not all rentals are getting smaller. Taking a cue from the condo market, some Manhattan rental buildings are going in the opposite direction. At 393 West End Avenue on the Upper West Side, Simon Baron Development is overhauling a prewar rental with 113 apartments, combining vacant units to create 47 large apartments with families in mind. The apartments, mostly two-, three- and four-bedrooms, will range from 893 to 2,274 square feet. Developers have been successful with family-size residences, said Jacqueline Urgo, the president of the Marketing Directors, a New York development advisory, leasing and marketing company, which is handling the project. ""We think there's a real niche to be filled in similar luxury rentals."" Designed by Vicente Wolf, the West End Avenue apartments are expected to rent from $5,250 a month for a one-bedroom to $23,000 a month for a four-bedroom. The building, which plans to begin leasing in May, will include a courtyard, a children's playroom and a gym. If none of these new rentals pique your interest, there's always next year. Among the large and eye-catching buildings expected to open are a 709-unit rental resembling a pyramid at 625 West 57th Street, designed by the BIG-Bjarke Ingels Group and developed by the Durst Organization; and 626 First Avenue, two copper towers cinched together by a sky bridge that will house 800 rentals, designed by SHoP Architects and developed by JDS Construction Group. ""These are the ones to watch as they come to market in 2016,"" said Jodi Stasse, the managing director for new developments at Citi Habitats. ""They are interesting because of their sheer size and great diversity in the project design.""","More than 13,000 new rental apartments are expected to hit the market in New York City this year.",f76ff0df-9892-5d69-aabf-5a945e785fb9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/25/realestate/25COV2/25COV2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=2dc2471e01e5e6780c79ac0d9495934aad0a7304eae493cf0ff55a62ff776af7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Coming soon, rentals at 605 West 42nd Street.",f76ff0df-9892-5d69-aabf-5a945e785fb9,N24News/imgs/f76ff0df-9892-5d69-aabf-5a945e785fb9.jpg,7
Fashion & Style,"Dallas Church Offers Free Weddings to Couples Living Together, on One Condition",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/fashion/weddings/dallas-mass-wedding-after-taking-marriage-challenge.html,"A few months before Kelvin Evans married his live-in girlfriend, Pa Shoua Pha, in 2016, uncertainty gripped him. ""I had convinced myself that I wasn't going to have any more children,"" said Mr. Evans, 44, the father of two boys from a previous relationship. But his girlfriend, he said, wanted to start a family and ""it became a huge sticking point."" Fortunately, the couple had a support network through the Concord Church, a nondenominational Christian church, in Dallas. Alongside five other cohabiting couples, they signed up for a ""step into marriage"" challenge and worked out their issues. On Aug. 27, 2016, all six couples, plus 19 other couples who also took the challenge, married in a mass ceremony. Mr. and Ms. Evans now have a daughter, Ava Naomi, who was born this past March, and Mr. Evans couldn't be happier. ""If I was doing any better,"" he said, ""it would probably be illegal.""

Every three years since 2010, Pastor Bryan Carter has issued a call to arms to his 8,500 parishioners at Concord, in South Dallas: Disavow living together and commit to marriage. To sweeten the deal, he throws in a free wedding, complete with white gown, tuxedo, wedding bands, bouquets and a post-wedding reception. Mr. Carter officiates for the couples who make it through the 11 weeks of premarital counseling, which is part of the challenge. The handful that bow out of marriage can receive one month's rent (up to $750) toward a new place to live, so long as it doesn't include a cohabiting partner. Mr. Carter believes cohabitation is not the correct lifestyle choice for couples in committed relationships. ""We believe marriage builds a better foundation for people than saying, 'Hey, let me try you out for a few weeks. Let's live together,'"" he said. At least one researcher backs him up: ""By recent estimates, those who cohabited before marriage have an increased annual risk for marital dissolution that is about 30 percent higher than those who did not cohabit before marriage,"" Scott Stanley, a researcher in the psychology department at the University of Denver, said in an email. Some are not so sure living together first is a negative thing: The Council on Contemporary Families published a report last year concluding that premarital cohabitation may make couples less likely to divorce.

Mr. Carter and the couples taking the marriage challenge (currently 50 couples at Concord are prepping for a Sept. 7 mass wedding) are aware of the practical benefits of cohabitation, like testing relationship stability and sharing bills. Mr. Carter briefly lived with his wife, Stephanie Carter, before they married 21 years ago. ""I know the temptations, because I went through them myself before my faith made me realize there's a better way,"" he said. (For him, the appeal was convenience. He had just moved to Texas and needed a place to stay.) Mr. Carter is also aware of the popularity of cohabitation, especially among millennials and people over 50. According to a 2018 Pew study, 15 percent of adults ages 25 to 34 live with an unmarried partner, up from 12 percent in 2008. A 2017 Pew report found that 23 percent of cohabiting adults are over 50, a 75 percent increase for that age group since 2007. Over all, 18 million American adults are cohabiting, up from 14 million in 2007, Census Bureau data shows. About 60 percent of couples currently working through relationship kinks at Concord are millennials. Participation is up from 20 couples to 50 since the first installment nine years ago. And the program is spreading. Since 2010, six churches, including one near Atlanta and another in Chicago, have adopted Mr. Carter's pathway to marriage program for their own parishioners. This is something Mr. Carter wanted to happen, and sort of expected.

In addition to premarital counseling, which covers topics including finances, blended families and sex, couples who go on to participate in the mass wedding also get a mentor from the church to shepherd them through their first year of marriage. There are no guarantees, of course. Mr. Carter estimated that 80 percent of the 57 couples he has married through mass ceremonies have remained married. ""We're not saying marriage is the end-all, be-all,"" he said. ""We're saying it's the best route to sustaining families."" At Concord, that doesn't mean that cohabiting couples are looked down upon if they don't choose to be challenged, he said. ""This is not a high-pressure deal,"" Mr. Carter said. ""It's more or less an opportunity."" The opportunity to get married for free is enough to attract some people. Gowns and tuxedos are donated by local businesses, and the rings are sold to the church at a discount. Professional planners, makeup artists and hair stylists also volunteer for the weddings. Those wanting the spotlight to be fully on them on their wedding day know to check their egos at the church door.

""Most women at the start of our premarital counseling group were like, 'What?'"" Mr. Evans said of the idea of not being the sole bride. ""But as we got into the class, we got to know each other intimately. The gloves came off. And being able to share the wedding together made it really special."" To date, no same-sex couples have volunteered for the challenge. If they did, Mr. Carter said, he would refer them to a different church to be married. Though Concord welcomes the L.G.B.T.Q. community, he said, ""our church believes in more traditional model of marriage."" This is one reason some religious leaders are not so enthusiastic about Mr. Carter's program. ""Research bears the pastor out that stable marriages do support better mental health and stability in children,"" said Janne Eller-Isaacs, a senior co-pastor at Unity Church-Unitarian in St. Paul, Minn. ""My bias is that I don't want to be promoting an old-style, patriarchal marriage. As someone who has married lesbians, gays and transgendered folks, making the ritual of marriage available to all people is extremely important to me."" Rabbi Matthew D. Gewirtz, the senior pastor at Congregation B'nai Jeshurun in Short Hills, N.J., also has mixed feelings about the marriage challenge. ""I'm not going to reject it out of hand, because the pastor respects God and community and may believe he's saving the world in this way,"" he said. ""I've learned enough to know that cohabitation has helped a lot of people, and I lose all capital to be able to talk to people about what makes the most sacred and loving connections if I'm just reminding them of what they thought religion always was, meaning hierarchical and judgmental and not in touch with what's going on in the world."" Rabbi Gewirtz also wonders if the church's resources might be better spent feeding the hungry or housing the homeless. ""But that's just a different point of view,"" he said. It is a view Mr. Carter is familiar with. His Twitter announcement of this year's challenge reached 300,000 people, he said, and most feedback was positive. ""But we had a few detractors who said, 'Why would the church be concerned about someone's relationship? Couldn't it do more with that money to feed people?'"" he said.","In 2016, 25 couples married in a mass ceremony, after they agreed to 11 weeks of premarital counseling.

Food,A 'Queer Eye' Makeover for a Vintage Diner,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/27/dining/queer-eye-village-den-antoni-porowski.html,"The first thing Antoni Porowski -- the food and wine expert on ""Queer Eye,"" this year's hit reboot of the makeover TV show -- wants everyone to know about his new West Village restaurant is that it will not center on avocado.

The fruit became a meme associated with Mr. Porowski after two episodes of the inaugural season showed him teaching the program's recruits how to make vastly simplified avocado dishes. ""That scarred me a little,"" he said. ""The first draft of the menu didn't have a single avocado anywhere.""

He has since softened his stance. There may be some avocado at Village Den, the fast-casual cafe he plans to open next month in the beloved former diner of the same name. The overall theme will be comfort food with a nutritious spin: cabbage rolls stuffed with turkey and cauliflower rice (a nod to his Polish heritage), and TV-dinner-inspired trays, like macadamia-crusted fish sticks with maple parsnip mash, that fit into the low-carb ketosis diet. (Mr. Porowski is an occasional adherent.)","Antoni Porowski, the food guy on the hit TV series, is planning his first restaurant, the fast-casual Village Den.",6d6342b0-230d-54eb-a136-47774f7d6411,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/29/dining/29queereye2/merlin_134736813_1d98032d-fe3c-4cd1-a15e-550d559df8b5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=05cbc0d1f13452d503d1e0e702c7d4ba4fc3fd0db5ef33fc0154e95b1c0c16b8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Antoni Porowski in his Brooklyn apartment.,6d6342b0-230d-54eb-a136-47774f7d6411,N24News/imgs/6d6342b0-230d-54eb-a136-47774f7d6411.jpg,17
Your Money,"After Years Out of a Job, Older Workers Find a Way Back In",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/07/your-money/after-years-out-of-a-job-older-workers-find-a-way-back-in.html,"AFTER five years of being unemployed or underemployed, Rosanna Horton, 55, is back where she wants to be: working full time. In July 2007, Ms. Horton left her job at the University of California, Irvine, and moved north to San Francisco to take care of her mother and finish her dissertation. She sold her condominium, intending to live off the proceeds. She figured she would have no problem going back to work in a better position. A year and a half later, she had completed her dissertation and received her doctoral degree in education. But the job market was a disaster. Even with her new doctorate in hand, she found nothing suitable, setting in motion an unexpected downward spiral. At times, Ms. Horton, said she was ""sofa surfing,"" or sleeping on a relative's or friend's couch.

""It put you in a position of thinking, 'I should not have left my job,'"" she said. ""I am the kind of person who thinks things happen and you take responsibility and you move on."" Ms. Horton barely scraped by, she said, making it through a long period without much income only with the help of a ""very small circle"" of family and friends. She worked in unpaid fellowships, temporary and contract positions before finally turning, in September 2013, to the San Francisco Jewish Vocational Service, an organization that helps people build skills and find jobs. The recession was over, but it was still a challenge to find a decent job in a rapidly transforming economy. In what she calls her ""aha!"" moment, Ms. Horton decided to take her degrees off her resume -- all of them -- so as not to be perceived as overqualified, and to get her ""foot in the door."" At the beginning of 2014, she was hired as manager of radiology and biomedical imaging at the University of California, San Francisco, where she has been working ever since. She is making more money now than she was when she left her job in 2007. ""What better way to end your career than doing something you care about and can affect others in a positive way?"" she said. Her goal now? ""I'm working till I'm 70."" Long-term unemployment ""is a challenging and often hidden problem,"" said Abby Snay, executive director of the San Francisco Jewish Vocational Service, which is part of a larger network, the International Association of Jewish Vocational Services.

In the economic downturn that began in late 2007 and persisted through the middle of 2009, millions of people in their 50s and 60s were laid off, bought out, downsized or otherwise left without a steady paycheck. The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, in a report titled, ""How Will Older Workers Who Lose Their Jobs During the Great Recession Fare in the Long Run?"" found that the recession hit many more workers over 50 compared with previous downturns. By 2012, many of these people were still out of work, said Matthew S. Rutledge, a labor economist at the Center for Retirement Research and a co-author of the paper. ""It was really difficult for them to get back in,"" he said. ""It didn't matter if they had retired or were laid off.""

For those without jobs, that put even more pressure on them to return to the work force and impelled many to keep working well past their original target for retirement. One result is that the work force is growing older. According to Andrew G. Biggs, an American Enterprise Institute resident scholar and a former top official at the Social Security Administration, there are 3.9 million more workers ages 60 to 64 today than in 2005, the last full year before the beginning of the economic slowdown. By comparison, he noted in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, there are fewer Americans ages 20 to 55 working today than in 2005. For older Americans, paths to returning to full-time work vary. Some go into consulting, others seek specialized knowledge and new contacts by working as a volunteer. Still others resume their education through courses online or at a for-profit or community college, while some enroll in professional association courses. Many decide to start a business. The biggest challenge for those seeking a new job after an extended period of unemployment is updating their skills for the current workplace. ""If you have been laid off or retired for a couple of years, skill sets may have moved on quite rapidly without you,"" said Mark Schmit, executive director of the SHRM Foundation, a research affiliate of the Society for Human Resource Management. ""This puts you at a disadvantage to the people who are working, including peers who are the same age.""

Rich Feller is a professor of counseling and career development at Colorado State University, past president of the National Career Development Association and a thought leader with AARP Life Reimagined. Dr. Feller said a key credential for returning to the work force is the ability to ""document your technology skills."" If you can, he said, employers will ""overlook your age."" He suggests community college or online courses as a way to master new skills. The popular belief that younger workers are more productive than older workers is ""largely a myth,"" Mr. Schmit said. ""The only evidence we have of that is in physical labor. It's absolutely true that older people can learn and are motivated to learn just as younger people are."" Rick Dottermusch, 58, began taking courses at Montgomery College, at first as a ""diversion"" until he found his next job. Five months ago, he began working in web development at a technology company in the Washington area, moving out of sales, his job for 30 years. ""The students -- whether high school graduates or those with a master's -- are looking for current skills and they're willing to spend their time taking courses if they are courses aligned with the market, with what employers need,"" said Steve Greenfield, dean of work force development and continuing education at Montgomery College, a community college outside Washington. ""We do labor market research before we even run a class."" But just getting the training is not enough. ""Networking is an important part"" of a job search, Mr. Dottermusch said. ""If you know someone who can provide an entree, anyone who can tell you more about the company, if nothing else pick their brain -- what is the best way to approach that company?"" And those seeking a change in the type of work they do must be prepared to lower their expectations, at least initially. ""If you have retrained for a new career and learned a new skill, expect to start at a lower level, lower pay grade,"" Mr. Schmit said. For Dave Gustafson, 61, moving from working as an employee for 30 years to working as a real estate broker on a commission-only basis has been taxing. ""It takes a certain amount of courage,"" he said.","Hit hard by the economic downturn, older job-seekers are finding that courses — online or off — can provide the bridge back to the work force.",1afbe961-7f61-5aa3-9a7e-e2359c4e461a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/06/business/07retiring-web/07retiring-web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=1b907e8e58665ddbb259ed54711d4fd355a7aaf9e5303775535affc9125be42a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dave Gustafson, right, a broker, and Adrienne Scharli at a home that will be coming onto the market in Fort Collins, Colo.

Opinion,"Mayor de Blasio, Open Your Eyes. The Police Are Out of Control.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/opinion/new-york-protests.html,"The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values . It is separate from the newsroom.





Hundreds of protesters walked toward Cadman Plaza Park in Brooklyn on Wednesday night around 9 o'clock. Encountering a line of New York City police officers in riot gear, they chanted peacefully, hands in the air. Officers responded by beating them with nightsticks. Similar scenes have played out across New York in recent days. Even as the police struggle to prevent looting and other illegal activity, the city has sent scores of armored officers to contain and confront peaceful protesters. Video footage shows officers pushing, punching and beating people, pepper-spraying people, hitting people with police vehicles. New Yorkers have taken to the streets of the city to demand an end to police brutality, to express their pain and their hope that their voices will be heard -- that their rights will be respected. All too often, the police have responded with more violence. New York's mayor, Bill de Blasio, is responsible for the city's failure to protect the safety of its residents. As evidence of police abuse has mounted, he has averted his eyes, insisting Thursday that the Police Department uses as ""light a touch as possible.""

""We are doing everything from a perspective of restraint,"" he said at a news conference. Many police officers are performing with grace under difficult conditions; some have been injured in the line of duty. And it cannot be easy for men and women sworn to protect the public to hear themselves accused by demonstrators as threats to society. The Police Department also faces a genuine challenge in preventing lawless outbursts of looting that have left shopping streets in New York and other cities in ruins. But Mr. de Blasio appears unwilling to confront the reality that the department is failing to meet the demands of this moment. Officers have been allowed to behave in a manner that disgraces their mission to protect and serve, and violates the public trust. The mayor is allowing that to happen. Mr. de Blasio has escalated tensions by imposing a curfew on the city, a curfew that primarily seems to be serving to criminalize what would otherwise be lawful assemblies. The mayor defended the policy on Thursday, declaring, ""There is a point where enough is enough."" He added, ""If officers say now is the point we need you to go home, it's time to go home."" Mr. de Blasio may have the power to erect such arbitrary barriers to protest; he clearly does not have the wisdom to refrain from using it. So long as demonstrations are peaceful, the mayor and the police should stop and listen to the legitimate concerns of those they serve.

It is abhorrent to instead respond to protests about police violence by beating protesters. The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, also has shied away from the problem, insisting on Thursday that the police were not bludgeoning peaceful citizens ""for no reason."" ""That's not a fact,"" he said. ""They don't do that."" If they did, he added, ""it's wrong."" What pressing responsibilities have so occupied these two officials that they do not have the time to make sure the safety of New Yorkers is protected and the rights of New Yorkers are respected? How is it possible that after so many reports of police misconduct, they still can't be bothered to supervise the police? These problems are hardly specific to New York. Police officers in cities across the country have subjected protesters, journalists and innocent bystanders to similar abuse. But the failure of Messrs. de Blasio and Cuomo to protect their constituents from police violence is a particularly painful betrayal. Mr. de Blasio campaigned on a promise to hold the Police Department accountable, particularly for the fair treatment of black and Hispanic New Yorkers. His signature 2013 campaign ad featured his black son, Dante de Blasio, promising voters that his father understood the dangers and pain too often faced by black people at the hands of the police. In recent days, both the mayor and the governor have walked a messy, head-spinning line on the unrest in New York, defending the police in one breath, then acknowledging the need for reforms in another.

The state's police unions have a long history of fiercely and successfully opposing necessary reforms. The clear message of these protests is that change cannot be deferred any longer. In a letter published in The Daily News this week, more than 200 current and former de Blasio administration officials said they ""could not remain silent while the Administration we served allows the NYPD to turn our City into an occupied territory."" They wrote, ""Our former boss might not hear the cries for justice from Black and brown New Yorkers, but we do."" The mayor has committed to modest reforms. He said he would sign a City Council bill that would make the use of chokeholds by the police a crime, but only if there were an exception for circumstances where the life of the officer was in danger. He has promised to investigate the use of police force against protesters in recent days. He has vowed to speed up the police disciplinary process. That's not nearly enough, but those debates can wait a few more days. The immediate imperative is to keep a firm hand on police behavior in this dangerous moment. The police commissioner serves at the pleasure of Mr. de Blasio. If he cannot maintain control of his officers, Mr. de Blasio must find someone who can.

Art & Design,Five Art Books to Read This Summer,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/arts/design/art-books-to-read-this-summer-virus.html,"For much of the culture industry, as with society at large, a single pressing issue looms over all others: Join the rush to reopen? Or remain anxiously hunkered down, lest -- like the fake ending of so many horror movies -- the seemingly defeated killer suddenly re-emerges from his hiding spot. Yet in a growing number of quarters throughout the art world, the very terms of that debate are being questioned. Impassioned essays and teeth-gnashing Instagram posts are asking if getting ""back to normal"" should truly be the final goal. Many of these critiques of business-as-usual mirror larger socio-economic complaints, from the art handlers who quietly keep the entire billion-dollar business humming along organizing for better wages and working conditions, to the emerging artists trying to make sense of the disconnect between their own running-in-place careers and record-setting auction results. Where is the art to help us make sense of this moment, or to at least freshly question the way our current contemporary art has been produced, bought, and sold? And what would that alternative art world look like? Here are five recently published books that mine that subject.

Few modern artists have been as closely associated with artmaking in a time of plague as David Wojnarowicz (1954-1992), whose work channeled a burning sense of outrage, first for his friends and lovers as they fell to AIDS, and then for his own looming mortality, as public officials seemed either indifferent or openly hostile to the disease's victims simply because so many were gay. Wojnarowicz's diaristic writing took on more complex feelings, as fascinatingly compiled in a handmade catalog he titled ""In the Shadow of Forward Motion"" to accompany a 1989 solo show. His gallery, New York's P.P.O.W., didn't have the budget then for a slick, professionally printed version, so he simply Xeroxed 50 copies for his show's opening, explaining in its foreword that his samizdat exhibition catalog was simply ""rough notes, late night tape recordings, things spoken in sleep and fragmented ideas which at times contradict each other."" He grossly undersold it. Now reissued as a paperback by the archival publisher Primary Information, it offers not only a look into Wojnarowicz's process, but also his philosophical musings, by turns wistful and playful -- yet always with the outside world pressing in. A diagram for how the gallery should hang a wall of his photos is grounded by the notes-to-self scrawled at the bottom of the page: ""Pay Rent"" and ""Doctor 12:30 Thurs.""

The Cometbus journal had a similarly modest cut-and-pasted start in the Berkeley, Calif., bedroom of its 13-year-old editor, and a punk rock enthusiast, Aaron Elliott. Nearly 40 years later, Cometbus is still going strong, still self-published (albeit now handsomely typeset and bound), and still taking as its mandate all the workings of underground culture. Its 59th issue, released just as the pandemic began closing its sales network of independent bookstores, is appropriately entitled ""Post-Mortem."" Consisting of a single 48,000 word essay written by Mr. Elliott, now based in Brooklyn, it colorfully records his past year crisscrossing the country to conduct revealing interviews with several generations' worth of countercultural figures who built lasting counterinstitutions, from Fantagraphics Books' Gary Groth in Seattle to Interference Archive's Josh MacPhee in Park Slope -- or who spectacularly failed to do so. The end result memorably splits the difference between memoir and business journalism, and is likely the sole place to find equally probing discussions of freight train-hopping and nonprofit incorporation.

The painter David Byrd (1926-2013) had the kind of career trajectory most artists dream of -- a solo show with the pioneering Seattle gallerist Greg Kucera, followed by an equally acclaimed show at New York's White Columns, and then representation by the blue-chip Anton Kern Gallery -- as long as you ignore the seven decades before his being discovered in upstate New York. It's also a cruel iteration that artistic talent often has little to do with timely recognition. During that period, Byrd worked as an orderly on the psychiatric ward of the Montrose Veterans Affairs hospital in Westchester. Montrose VA 1958-1988 is a complete replica of a handmade book Byrd created to document his 30 years there, drawing his patients in various states of despair and confusion, or all too rarely, moments of transcendent peacefulness. To call it a sketchbook doesn't begin to do justice to Byrd's draftsmanship, or to the otherworldly quality he brings to rendering his patients' inner lives on the page.

A global health crisis hasn't made Cafe Royal Books break stride. Virtually every Thursday, Craig Atkinson (""Cafe Royal Books is just me"") of Southport, England, ushers a new, modestly priced, elegantly straightforward, zine-style photography monograph into the world. The goal is simple -- ""publishing, preserving, and making accessible British documentary photography."" That means mining the archives of both relatively well-known figures like Tish Murtha, whose photos of the 1977 Silver Jubilee honoring Queen Elizabeth capture that national celebratory moment in granular (and often hysterically funny) form, as well as those deserving of more attention, like Simon Pope. His grimy shots of mid-70s London children giddily turning their hollowed-out city into an industrial playground make it seem as if the Blitz had just ended.

The results, as seen in this monograph, put the focus on her four children, all documented over the subsequent decade with a striking intensity. Her subjects don't just intimately acknowledge the camera, they inhabit it, growing up right in front of Ms. Black's lens. And the outside world never stops intruding, from one child's black eye (""jumped in the street"" elliptically notes the photo's caption) to another's suddenly spiky haircut, menacing gaze, and hand-painted cutoff T-shirt emblazoned with the chorus to an equally aggrieved punk anthem, ""We're just a minor threat."" As the years unfold, Ms. Black's sumptuous black and white portraiture reveals less a snapshot of cozy domesticity than a series of coping mechanisms, ways of learning how to finally become comfortable in one's own skin. It's a reminder that, whatever the era, and regardless of whether they're artists, most folks are forced to figure out their own path to so-called normalcy.","As the art world mulls whether a return to ""normalcy"" should be its goal, publishers mine the archives of artists who found their own counterpaths.",905bf64b-9e32-53ca-993f-d28b8f6bae5a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/22/arts/21alt-art-books-pope3/merlin_172616313_0bbac966-0157-4247-910f-4ff4a51377ce-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=1e8aaac8883e066b3dedc6dadf8e8270bb750e636e5bb9c6af8606001655b6e6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"An image from Simon Pope&rsquo;s &ldquo;City Kids London 1973&ndash;1975,&rdquo; a zine-style photography monograph from Caf&eacute; Royal Books.",905bf64b-9e32-53ca-993f-d28b8f6bae5a,N24News/imgs/905bf64b-9e32-53ca-993f-d28b8f6bae5a.jpg,14
Books,"Anne Rivers Siddons, Novelist Whose Muse Was the New South, Dies at 83",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/13/books/anne-rivers-siddons-dead.html,"The novelist Anne Rivers Siddons in 2000. She defined herself as a storyteller and resisted being categorized as a women's writer.





Anne Rivers Siddons, Novelist Whose Muse Was the New South, Dies at 83

Anne Rivers Siddons, whose popular novels, set largely in the South, took female characters on emotional journeys that touched on the region's racial and social attitudes, died on Wednesday at her home in Charleston, S.C. She was 83. Her stepson David Siddons said the cause was lung cancer. Ms. Siddons had been an advertising copywriter and a magazine writer when she started writing novels in the 1970s. Her breakthrough, "" Peachtree Road"" (1988), was a generational saga about Atlanta's evolution since World War II, told through two cousins. Ms. Siddons was urged by her friend the writer Pat Conroy to write a novel that would reflect her ambivalence about Atlanta, her adopted home. She had long admired the city's vigor but felt that its relentless growth had gone too far. ""As Ms. Siddons offered argument after argument about why she couldn't do the book,"" The Atlanta Journal and Constitution wrote in 1988, ""she mentioned that a woman friend of hers had just died. 'The South killed her the day she was born; it just took her that long to die.'""

Hearing that, Mr. Conroy told her, ""That's the opening of your great book about Atlanta."" It was indeed the first line of the prologue in ""Peachtree Road,"" in which she replaced ""she"" with the name of a lead character, Lucy Bondurant Chastain Venable. ""Peachtree Road"" invited comparisons to ""Gone With the Wind,"" an earlier sweeping novel with Atlanta as its backdrop. In his review in The Journal and Constitution , Bob Summer wrote that Ms. Siddons had evoked the city as well as Margaret Mitchell had. He added, ""Ms. Siddons skillfully weaves bright threads of humor, nuance and an exacting observation of the social mores of the times she is writing about; surely she is the Jane Austen of modern Atlanta."" Ms. Siddons's breakthrough novel, ""Peachtree Road"" (1988), was a generational saga that invited comparisons to ""Gone With the Wind."" Ms. Siddons defined herself as a storyteller, like Mr. Conroy, and resisted being categorized as a women's writer. Still, her understanding of women's struggles imbued all her novels, up through her final one, ""The Girls of August"" (2014), about a group of longtime friends whose annual oceanfront gathering is shattered when one of them dies.

""All my books are about women taking journeys they might not want to take,"" Ms. Siddons told an interviewer in 2008 . ""It's about finding wholeness. I know so few families anymore, and how can we have whole families if we don't have whole women?"" Sybil Anne Rivers was born on Jan 9, 1936, in Fairburn , Ga., a small town about 20 miles southwest of Atlanta. Her father, Marvin, was a patent lawyer, and her mother, Katherine ( Kitchen ) Rivers, was the secretary to a high school principal. She was a young Southern belle: a cheerleader and homecoming queen in high school and a popular sorority sister at Auburn University in Alabama. But in 1957, early in the civil rights movement, she broke with custom by writing two columns for the school newspaper supporting integration. ""What we are advocating when we gather in howling mobs like animals and throw stones and wreck automobiles and beat helpless individuals is wrong, and I don't care from which of the myriad angles you choose to look at it,"" she wrote. She was fired after the second column was published. She moved to Atlanta after graduating from Auburn with a bachelor's degree. There she worked in advertising and as a writer and editor at Atlanta magazine. ""I saw that my writing was a gift and not just a twitch,"" she told People magazine in 1991. Essays and humor pieces that she had written for Atlanta, House Beautiful and Georgia magazines were collected in her first book, ""John Chancellor Makes Me Cry,"" published in 1975.

Her first novel, ""Heartbreak Hotel,"" followed a year later. Inspired by her experiences on the college paper at Auburn, it tells the story of a similar act of defiance by a popular sorority sister on the campus of fictional Randolph University in Alabama. ""That book spoke to me,"" the novelist Cassandra King, Mr. Conroy's wife, said by phone. ""I thought this was a woman of my generation who had had the courage to do what she had done at Auburn. She really stuck her neck out and took risks."" Ms. Siddons had been an advertising copywriter and a magazine writer before publishing her first novel, ""Heartbreak Hotel,"" in 1976. ""Heartbreak Hotel"" was made into a movie, ""Heart of Dixie"" (1989), starring Ally Sheedy, Virginia Madsen and Phoebe Cates and directed by Martin Davidson. Ms. Siddons's writing career was derailed in the early 1980s by severe depression. She didn't write for three years, but after being prescribed medication and working with a therapist, she returned with ""Homeplace"" (1987). ""If I couldn't write, it would have killed me,"" she told BookPage, a book review publication, in 1998. In all, she wrote 15 more novels, many of which made The New York Times's best-seller list. Jamie Raab, who as the president of Grand Central Publishing edited Ms. Siddons's last three books, said that she had created characters that resonated with her readers.

""When we met, we started talking about her characters like they were personal friends of ours,"" Ms. Raab, now the president of Celadon Books, said by phone. ""That's how we bonded."" Before she died, David Siddons said, Ms. Siddons had thought of an idea for a new novel -- about the friendship between a white girl and a black girl at the time of the Selma-to-Montgomery civil rights marches in 1965. In addition to him, Ms. Siddons, who had homes in Charleston and in Brooklin, Me., is survived by three other stepsons, Kem , Rick and Lee Siddons, and three step-grandchildren. Her husband, Heyward Siddons, died in 2014. Ms. Siddons came to understand that her desire to write was a reaction to her traditional upbringing. ""The South is hard on women,"" she told People, ""partly because of the emphasis on looks and charm. No matter what I did, I always ended up with this hollow feeling. It finally hit me. ""That's why I wrote: I am writing about the journey we take to find out what lives in that hole.""",She found inspiration in her Georgia upbringing and in Atlanta's evolution into a major postwar city.,2d652fec-2240-53a8-ab4b-92f13c6c63c5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/15/obituaries/15Siddons-obit1/13Siddons-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=46b0a84b18decb0e46d869802bb97c093fe76c807d58d572cbee4481be849b9d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The novelist Anne Rivers Siddons in 2000.

Art & Design,Women Say Richard Meier's Conduct Was Widely Known Yet Went Unchecked,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/arts/design/richard-meier-sexual-misconduct-allegations.html,"Not long after she joined Richard Meier's architecture firm in 1989, Karin Bruckner was working at the office one Sunday, she said, when Mr. Meier came up beside her at a copy machine and started rubbing his body up and down against hers.

""I just stood there and froze,"" Ms. Bruckner said. ""'This is not happening' -- that's the first thing you think about -- 'He's not doing this right now, I'm sure he's not doing this.'""

She later confided to John Eisler, a senior associate, about what had occurred, and Mr. Eisler was sympathetic.

""It's not something that was a secret,"" he said in a recent interview about Mr. Meier's conduct. But Mr. Eisler, who spent 20 years at the firm, said he did not confront Mr. Meier after hearing from Ms. Bruckner.

""I am sorry,"" he said, ""that I did not.""

After a report last month by The New York Times detailing a pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Meier, more women have come forward to share their own upsetting encounters with him. But in recounting such experiences, these women said they had also been disturbed by a sense of helplessness that pervaded the firm. Mr. Meier's behavior was common knowledge, they said, but no one seemed to have the power to stop it.

Over the last six months, a number of fields have been forced to reckon with revelations regarding powerful men who harassed or assaulted underlings, some for many years, without being stopped by their companies or organizations.

At Richard Meier & Partners Architects, there was no one more powerful than Mr. Meier, a world-famous architect whose firm depended on him for its prestige and success. It was years before #MeToo; protesting harassment was far more perilous.

Ms. Bruckner said she did not fault Mr. Eisler for his silence.

""I don't think he felt he had any power to do anything about it,"" said Ms. Bruckner, who worked at the firm until 1992, when she left to work for the architect Philip Johnson. She said people in the office were too afraid of what would happen to the firm, and their jobs, should Mr. Meier's name be sullied.

""It's behavior that goes on for decades and never changes,"" she said. ""'We don't go up against the bad guy because it will have a domino effect; if he falls down, everybody else falls down.'""

Following the initial Times report, which involved five women, Mr. Meier, 83, said that ""while our recollections may differ, I sincerely apologize to anyone who was offended by my behavior."" He said he would take a six-month leave from his firm.

Four more women have since come forward to share their experiences concerning Mr. Meier: Ms. Bruckner; Eileen Delgado, a former office manager; Lucy Nathanson, Mr. Meier's former personal assistant; and Liz Lee, who worked as the communications coordinator.

Through a spokesman, Mr. Meier and his partners declined to be interviewed about the new accusations but issued this statement: ""The allegations involving Richard Meier, the most recent of which were nearly a decade old, do not reflect the ethos and culture of the firm, and it would be irresponsible to allow these personal allegations to tarnish the company.""

It is unclear to what extent executives at the firm, including Mr. Meier's partners, were aware of the sexual advances women are now publicly describing. Most of the women said they were too afraid for their jobs to lodge formal complaints with the management.

But some women did, and the firm appears to have reached at least two settlements. Ms. Delgado said she received about $25,000 in 1992 after Mr. Meier threw himself on top of her.

As reported earlier, Alexis Zamlich received $150,000 in 2009 after Mr. Meier had exposed himself to her, and another employee -- Laura Trimble Elbogen -- reported that Mr. Meier had asked her to undress, accounts that have been confirmed by the firm's former chief operating officer.

All three episodes were said to have occurred in Mr. Meier's Upper East Side apartment.

The firm has declined to discuss any settlements, but it said that after the two 2009 incidents, it instituted its first sexual harassment training program and updated its sexual harassment policy, which was put in the company handbook in 1993. No women have come forward to report negative experiences at the firm from after 2009.

Ms. Delgado, who worked as the office manager for several months in 1991 and 1992, said that Mr. Meier had asked her to work at his apartment, where he gave her a glass of wine and sat beside her on the sofa. ""All of a sudden, I was thrust back and hit my head on a table,"" Ms. Delgado said. ""This man was on top of me, his tongue was down my throat, and he put my hand on his penis.""

The next day at the office, Ms. Delgado told the bookkeeper, Francina Foskey, who she said responded, ""Oh, God, you, too?,"" and then proceeded to spin through a Rolodex, pointing to the names of women who had complained to her about Meier's sexual overtures. ""She said, 'Her, her, her, her,' and as she's turning them, we're counting,"" Ms. Delgado said. (Ms. Foskey died in 1997.)

Ms. Delgado said she got up the courage to hire a lawyer and settled with the firm under a nondisclosure agreement. Mr. Meier's two other partners at the time were Robert Gatje and Thomas Phifer.","More women have accused the famous architect of sexual misconduct, and they say the firm seemed powerless to stop his behavior.",1b649a7f-237c-5409-a549-95b178841d81,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/06/arts/06MEIERFIRM/05meierfirm-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=f2166e66b4487ac2bf37776a849a9d242c753d5ecd4eac0f344b1f0a430c5b0b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Lucy Nathanson, Liz Lee, Karin Bruckner and Eileen Delgado.

Theater,"'Be More Chill' Is Heading to Broadway, Fueled by Social Media",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/theater/be-more-chill-broadway.html,"Talia Suskauer, left, a member of the ""Be More Chill"" cast, greets fans after Tuesday's performance at the Pershing Square Signature Center.

""Be More Chill,"" an energetic sci-fi musical set in the anxious halls of a high school, is coming to Broadway, propelled not by a presold megabrand or raves from critics, but a surge of social media. Producers are betting that Broadway, increasingly dominated by movie adaptations, jukebox musicals and plays starring celebrities, has room for a no-name show whose early evangelists have been adolescents converted to fandom by streaming the cast album online. Encouraged by the success of a current Off Broadway production, which sold out its run before the first performance, the producers announced Wednesday that they would open on Broadway in March at the 900-seat Lyceum Theater. The show, directed by Stephen Brackett, features a pop-rock score by Joe Iconis and a book by Joe Tracz.

Broadway is a risky business -- about three-quarters of all productions fail, and many a show with a strong tailwind has crashed. But angsty adolescents are hot these days, as evidenced by ""Dear Evan Hansen,"" ""Mean Girls"" and even ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child."" Mr. Goehring said he had raised the ""Be More Chill"" capitalization costs -- up to $9.5 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission -- in just a few days. ""Be More Chill,"" adapted from a young-adult novel by Ned Vizzini, is about a high school student who seeks to boost his popularity by swallowing a Japanese pill that turns out to be a computer chip that functions as a de facto life coach.

 The central characters, as in much popular culture about high school, are teenagers who feel socially ill-at-ease, and the universality of that experience appears to account for much of the show's popularity. Its breakout song, ""Michael in the Bathroom,"" is about a boy who feels so marginalized that he shuts himself away during a Halloween party. ""Even though the story is pretty nuts and there is this crazy sci-fi element, it really is a celebration of misfits and geeks and people who feel like they don't quite belong, and actual young people relate to the characters,"" said Mr. Iconis, who wrote the show's music and lyrics.

Mr. Iconis, a favorite on the city's cabaret scene, enjoyed a flash of success writing songs for the television series ""Smash,"" but has yet to have a commercially successful musical, and ""Be More Chill"" will be his Broadway debut. (His most popular song, by the way, is titled ""Broadway, Here I Come!"" but it's darker than that title might suggest.) ""Be More Chill"" had a production in 2015 at New Jersey's Two River Theater, which commissioned the show, but after an unenthusiastic New York Times review, Mr. Iconis thought its journey was over. ""It just kind of fizzled there -- the audiences were loving it so much, but we didn't get the review that a show like that needs to have a life, and we didn't have a commercial producer or a famous person attached, so I felt like that was the end, and it was a huge bummer,"" he said. But then Two River and Ghostlight Records agreed to make a cast album. The release, in the fall of 2015, was unremarkable. Yet in 2017, the creative team and stars began getting an unusual number of Twitter notifications and Instagram tags for no apparent reason.

Mr. Tracz, the book writer, said people even started emailing him to ask questions about the characters. ""We started to see these fanimatic, homegrown videos of 'Michael in the Bathroom,' and these Tumblr and Reddit pages were getting a lot of traction, and the streaming numbers were going up substantially,"" said Kurt Deutsch, the founder and president of Ghostlight Records, using the word ""fanimatic"" to describe animated storyboards created by fans. ""It was completely organic -- we don't have tons of marketing dollars to make this happen. It just grew to become a viral sensation.""

The cast album, discovered and shared online, has now been streamed more than 170 million times worldwide, making it among the most streamed theatrical cast albums. Mr. Goehring, the director of the theater arts program at Sacred Heart University in Connecticut, had not seen the Two River production and was unaware of the show's growing online fan base, but he was an admirer of Mr. Iconis's work and decided to direct a college version of the show. When fans started to fly in to see it, he snapped up the commercial rights. That, in turn, led to this summer's Off Broadway production, in a rented theater at the Pershing Square Signature Center, which runs until Sept. 30. Again, the Times review was unenthusiastic, but the crowds have been raucous. Most days, 1,500 people enter a digital lottery for two to four last-minute seats, and a one-week extension sold out in six hours. Among those who saw the show this summer: Robert Wankel, the president of the Shubert Organization, which then offered the producers the Lyceum on Broadway. Mr. Wankel said he had been struck by the youthfulness of the show's fan base, a sharp difference from the usual Broadway audience. ""This has truly been created by social media, which is fantastic,"" he said. ""Social media these days, I don't have to tell you, can make or break something, and in this particular case, they're loving it."" So now the show's creative team is discussing tweaks as they prepare for what they are thinking of as ""Be More Chill: 3.0"" -- Broadway. ""The fact that we've gotten here because actual human beings love the show is truly remarkable,"" Mr. Iconis said. ""It gives me faith.""",The sci-fi musical set in the halls of a high school will open in March at the Lyceum Theater.,d126797f-4c78-5217-a5e9-218092b69a7b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/06/arts/06CHILL1/06CHILL1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=532d4decfa9fd033ea10c32f19e25fb21c3453c9bd76536bf3074da730389acf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Talia Suskauer, left, a member of the &ldquo;Be More Chill&rdquo; cast, greets fans after Tuesday&rsquo;s performance at the Pershing Square Signature Center.",d126797f-4c78-5217-a5e9-218092b69a7b,N24News/imgs/d126797f-4c78-5217-a5e9-218092b69a7b.jpg,10
Books,A Search for U.F.O.s Leads to Utopian Dreams in This Debut Novel,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/books/review/brian-castleberry-nine-shiny-objects.html,"In the summer of 1947, a private pilot crossing the Cascade Mountains in Washington State reported seeing nine shiny objects in the sky. The sighting led to the first use of the term ""flying saucer"" and a global obsession with U.F.O.s.

It also sets in motion 's debut novel, ""Nine Shiny Objects."" The book's broad cast of characters are obsessed with the possibility of another way of life. Oliver Danville, a failed young actor, is looking for a reason to flee the Midwest when he reads a newspaper article about the sighting, ""the one that would change everything."" He hitchhikes west, following those nine shiny objects, and by the time he has reached the coast, he too has found a following. Without quite meaning to, he becomes the leader known as the Tzadi Sophit. He is the One, with a Vision that has been transferred to him by the Seekers.

Seekers of what? Vision of what? The answers to those questions are rather opaque. At the start, it seems Oliver promises his followers that they will be ""taken up"" by extraterrestrials, that ""a new dawn would come."" But the mission morphs. One of the followers, a leftist radio host named Alice Linwood, recalls the early days of the movement as a kind of proto-hippie commune: ""Funny thing was she started to believe. Belief, she liked to say later, infected her. At first it didn't matter what the root of the issue was, whether the Sophit's ideas came from alien beings or Moses or Dwight D. Eisenhower. What mattered was the end product.""

The end product for Alice and for many others seems to be family, belonging, a loving and racially diverse community. She believes so strongly in the Vision that she agrees to move across the country to Ridge Landing, a Long Island suburb near the site of a planned neighborhood of Seekers. Her family's job is to foster ""a general sense of racial harmony and progress,"" welcoming with other whites new black and Mexican neighbors, attending town meetings, spreading the word about desegregation and voting rights. Others in Ridge Landing aren't so progressive. One night, at a dinner party, violence erupts, and the Vision is irrevocably wounded.","In Brian Castleberry's ""Nine Shiny Objects,"" a broad cast of characters seek a different way of life in 20th-century America.",5755e3cf-a6c1-51e7-9970-16edb40406e5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/12/books/review/Henderson1/Henderson1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=8a4090481199c779decd1d3d2fb36d262b59bd3d8f5bb365055a6eeef5cd846a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Brian Castleberry,5755e3cf-a6c1-51e7-9970-16edb40406e5,N24News/imgs/5755e3cf-a6c1-51e7-9970-16edb40406e5.jpg,13
Education,Education Secretary May Agree to Waivers on 'No Child' Law Requirements,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/education/12educ.html,"Unless Congress acts by this fall to overhaul No Child Left Behind, the main federal law on public education, Secretary of Education Arne Duncan signaled that he would use his executive authority to free states from the law's centerpiece requirement that all students be proficient in reading and math by 2014. The Obama administration has been facing a mounting clamor from state school officials to waive substantial parts of the law, which President Bush signed in 2002, especially its requirement that states bring 100 percent of students to proficiency in reading and math by 2014 or else face sanctions. In March, Mr. Duncan predicted that the law would classify 80,000 of the nation's 100,000 public schools as failing this fall unless it was amended. But his efforts to address the problem have gained little traction on Capitol Hill, where several attempts since 2007 to rewrite the sprawling school accountability law have failed. ""We're not going to sit here and do nothing,"" Mr. Duncan told reporters on Friday in a conference call that was embargoed until midnight Saturday. ""Our first priority is to have Congress rewrite the law. If that doesn't get done, we have the obligation to provide relief in exchange for reform.""

While the secretary said it was premature to lay out specific plans for potential waivers, his aides said that the 100 percent proficiency standard would be the main target, and that restrictions on how federal money is spent could be relaxed. Mr. Duncan said in exchange for such flexibility, states would have to embrace President Obama's education priorities, a formula the administration used last year in its signature education initiative, the Race to the Top grant competition, which awarded money to those that opened new space for charter schools, toughened teacher evaluation systems, and remade their worst-performing schools, among other things. Congressional leaders reacted cautiously to Mr. Duncan's salvo. Representative John Kline, the Minnesota Republican who is chairman of the House education committee, ""remains concerned about any initiative that would allow the secretary to pick winners and losers in the nation's education system,"" said Jennifer Allen, a spokeswoman. Still, she said, Mr. Kline supports ""providing states and school districts with enhanced flexibility, believing a more streamlined federal role in education combined with reduced regulatory burdens would encourage greater innovation and higher academic achievement."" Senator Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat who is chairman of the Senate education committee, called Mr. Duncan's comments ""premature."" ""The best way to fix the problems in existing law is to pass a better one,"" he said in a statement. ""We are making good progress towards introducing a bill that will advance that goal. Given the bipartisan commitment in Congress to fixing No Child Left Behind, it seems premature at this point to take steps outside the legislative process that would address N.C.L.B.'s problems in a temporary and piecemeal way."" But since no draft legislation has been introduced in either chamber this year, experts are skeptical that Congress could send a rewrite of the law to Mr. Obama's desk by the time school begins this fall, as he requested in a recent speech.

Mr. Duncan said the administration would immediately reach out to governors, state school commissioners and other leaders to begin negotiations over the potential waivers, asking which provisions of the law they consider the most serious obstacles and what kinds of school improvement policies they would be willing to undertake in exchange. More than 40 states have agreed in recent months to adopt new common academic standards, and several of them have formally asked the Department of Education to exempt them from the law's accountability system. They argue that it is unreasonable and unfair to hold them to testing targets outlined in the Bush-era law even as they are trying to raise the bar with the new standards, and new tests being written to align with them. So far, Mr. Duncan has refused to grant such waiver requests, but his latest statement indicated that would change by fall if there is no action on the law. Some state education chiefs lauded Mr. Duncan for promising to fix the law's flaws after four years of Congressional paralysis. ""I'm pleased that there is an option for a Plan B,"" said Diane DeBacker, the commissioner of education in Kansas, a state that in February requested -- and was denied -- a waiver to the 100 percent proficiency by 2014 rule. ""This would work great for Kansas."" Arkansas lodged a similar waiver request in March. In a meeting last month of that state's Board of Education, Naccaman Williams, the chairman, reported that federal officials had denied the request but had told him they might reconsider it if Congress did not rewrite the law by the fall term. ""Basically I would sum it up as politics,"" Mr. Williams added. ""They're trying to encourage Congress to reauthorize.""

On Friday, Tom Kimbrell, the Arkansas education commissioner, said of Mr. Duncan's plan, ""It's better than the direction we have now, because we're being held to the old accountability system even when we're trying to adopt these new standards and put into place new assessments."" Sandy Kress, an Austin lawyer who as a senior education adviser to Mr. Bush helped devise the No Child Left Behind law, said he saw trouble in the administration's new stance. ""This idea of, 'if you don't act, we're going to go do these massive things' -- to me there's the feel of a threat to Congress in it,"" Mr. Kress said. Chester E. Finn, a Republican who is president of the Fordham Institute, an education research group, said the Congressional inaction was leading to an increasingly serious impasse in American government. ""If you believe in the rule of law, this is not good,"" Mr. Finn said. ""If the Congress can't fix, after 10 years, something that is widely seen as in need of repair, and the executive takes the law into its own hands, then we are looking at a dysfunctional government and a disruption of our separation of powers."" But Mr. Duncan said his authority was clear, and his aides sent reporters an e-mail copy of the legislative language: ""the secretary may waive any statutory or regulatory requirement of this act."" Mr. Duncan said: ""What I want to see in the fall is real action. It'll either come from Congress or from us. It's got to happen in real-people time, not Washington time.""","Facing a clamor from state school officials to waive substantial parts of No Child Left Behind, Arne Duncan may use his executive authority to free states from the law's centerpiece requirement.",f39ca9fc-7ecf-56fd-991b-a079e03e89c7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/06/12/us/education/education-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=364&w=600&s=507f9877ad6eb8e55e42d382b11677f69ecb3794128b4389847b5f81985eb6e7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Secretary of Education Arne Duncan suggested that the federal No Child Left Behind policy needed more flexibility.,f39ca9fc-7ecf-56fd-991b-a079e03e89c7,N24News/imgs/f39ca9fc-7ecf-56fd-991b-a079e03e89c7.jpg,22
Opinion,Investigate Tara Reade's Allegations,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/opinion/biden-tara-reade.html,"The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values . It is separate from the newsroom.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democrats' presumptive nominee for president, has forcefully denied allegations of sexual harassment and assault made against him by Tara Reade, a former staff assistant in his Senate office. ""They aren't true,"" Mr. Biden said in a statement on Friday. ""This never happened."" Ms. Reade's accusations, which have been percolating for several weeks, are grave and graphic. She charges that, in the spring of 1993, Mr. Biden cornered her in a deserted hallway of the Capitol complex, pinned her against a wall, reached under her skirt and penetrated her with his fingers. Ms. Reade's brother and multiple friends have said that she told them of the incident around the time it occurred. Some bits of evidence lend credence to her claim, even as others prompt skepticism. When Ms. Reade's brother, Collin Moulton, first spoke to The Washington Post about his sister's accusations, for instance, he mentioned only that she talked about Mr. Biden touching her neck and shoulders; several days later, Mr. Moulton texted The Post to say that he also recalled her sharing that Mr. Biden had put his hand ""under her clothes."" As is so often the case in such situations, it is all but impossible to be certain of the truth. But the stakes are too high to let the matter fester -- or leave it to be investigated by and adjudicated in the media. Mr. Biden is seeking the nation's highest office.

In 2018, this board advocated strongly for a vigorous inquiry into accusations of sexual misconduct raised against Brett Kavanaugh when he was nominated to a seat on the Supreme Court. Mr. Biden's pursuit of the presidency requires no less. His campaign, and his party, have a duty to assure the public that the accusations are being taken seriously. The Democratic National Committee should move to investigate the matter swiftly and thoroughly, with the full cooperation of the Biden campaign.
* Mark Penn and Andrew Stein write that ""only a broader course correction to the center will give Democrats a fighting chance in 2022"" and beyond.
* Tory Gavito and Adam Jentleson write that the Virgina loss should ""shock Democrats into confronting the powerful role that racially coded attacks play in American politics.""
* Ezra Klein speaks to David Shor, who discusses his fear that Democrats face electoral catastrophe unless they shift their messaging.
* Ross Douthat writes that the outcome of the Virginia gubernatorial race shows Democrats need a ""new way to talk about progressive ideology and education."" Ms. Reade's account has some apparent inconsistencies. Last year, she was one of several women who came forward with complaints of Mr. Biden hugging or touching them in ways that made them uncomfortable, but she did not raise the assault accusation until this March. She says she tried to share her story with the media earlier, only to get ""shut down."" Members of Mr. Biden's staff from that period have denied that Ms. Reade expressed any complaints about Mr. Biden, and they reject the idea that the office tolerated any harassment. Ms. Reade says that she filed a formal harassment complaint with a congressional personnel office in 1993. (She says the report did not mention the assault.) Although she kept some of her employment records from that time, she says she does not have a copy of that complaint. In his statement, Mr. Biden said that if such a document existed, there would be a copy of it in the National Archives, which retains records from what was then the Office of Fair Employment Practices. He called on the archives ""to identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document."" Later on Friday, after the National Archives said it did not have personnel documents, Mr. Biden asked the secretary of the Senate to direct a more extensive search, also asking for ""any and all other documents in the records that relate to the allegation."" This is a start, but it does not go far enough. Any serious inquiry must include the trove of records from Mr. Biden's Senate career that he donated to the University of Delaware in 2012. Currently, those files are set to remain sealed until after Mr. Biden retires from public life -- a common arrangement. There are growing calls for Mr. Biden to make those records available to see if they contain any mention of Ms. Reade or perhaps others who raised similar complaints about his behavior.

In a Friday interview on MSNBC, Mr. Biden resisted these calls, insisting that his Senate papers do not contain any personnel files and so could not possibly shed light on Ms. Reade's allegations. He added that they do, however, contain sensitive information about his past work that could be unfairly exploited in a presidential campaign. While understandable, this concern is not prohibitive -- and Mr. Biden's word is insufficient to dispel the cloud. Any inventory should be strictly limited to information about Ms. Reade and conducted by an unbiased, apolitical panel, put together by the D.N.C. and chosen to foster as much trust in its findings as possible. Admittedly, this would be a major undertaking. Mr. Biden served 36 years in the Senate. He turned over nearly 2,000 boxes and more than 400 gigabytes of data to the University of Delaware; most of it has not been cataloged. But the question at hand is no less than Mr. Biden's fitness for the presidency. No relevant memo should be left unexamined. It has been noted that President Trump has been accused of sexual harassment or assault by more than a dozen women. Those claims also should be investigated, and the Republicans concerned about Mr. Biden's behavior now should be at least equally focused on the questions about Mr. Trump's. For his part, Mr. Trump does not seriously address the claims against him; he simply denies them and attacks his accusers. Mr. Biden has set higher standards for himself. That has been central to his appeal. His campaign is founded on the promise of restoring sanity, civility and decency to the presidency. Even if certainty isn't possible in this matter, the American people deserve at least the confidence that he, and the Democratic Party, have made every effort to bring the truth to light.",Americans deserve to know more about a sexual assault accusation against the likely Democratic Party nominee.,229a5386-2dda-5d58-87a2-1cf1ab3cae22,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/02/opinion/02bidenprint/01biden1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=cd9c63a9179ad353cca0d032059cf827189fb3b082c95ca9a7f7cdbc3defc206&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Former Vice President Joe Biden at a campaign event in February at the Winyah Indigo Society Hall in Georgetown, S.C.",229a5386-2dda-5d58-87a2-1cf1ab3cae22,N24News/imgs/229a5386-2dda-5d58-87a2-1cf1ab3cae22.jpg,11

Sports,Bears' Hopes of Beating Eagles End With a Thunk-Thunk-Thud,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/06/sports/eagles-bears-nfl-playoffs.html,"CHICAGO -- Eleven months have elapsed since Philadelphia's improbable Super Bowl title, and on Sunday it was ever more necessary to re-establish this interval as fact. The playoffs, again, had arrived, and there, again, was Nick Foles, reprising his role as the Eagles' backup-turned-starter-turned-savior. So, to clarify for anyone squinting at their televisions and wondering how Foles managed to bend time and space: No, he did not actually depart one stadium in the Midwest after bewitching his opponent and then materialize in another to do the same -- though such confusion would be understandable. Foles, and the Eagles, seem to inhabit a place untouched by the mayhem churning all around them. Their mojo has been so good for the last month that on Sunday they foiled the league's most destructive defense with a go-ahead touchdown on fourth down and then watched a kick that would have doomed them clang first off the left upright and then bounce off the crossbar. The final score -- Philadelphia 16, Chicago 15 -- silenced the crowd at Soldier Field, which hosted its first playoff game in eight years, but not the occupants of the visitors' sideline, who danced and shouted and swarmed the grass after Cody Parkey's 43-yard attempt ricocheted to the ground, ushering the Eagles into a divisional-round matchup next Sunday afternoon at top-seeded New Orleans.

When the Eagles' locker room opened to the news media, music was blaring and some players were huddled, watching replays of the kick. Chris Long turned to his fellow defensive end Brandon Graham, sitting beside him, and said, ""It's a hard job being a kicker."" Graham said, ""I know, boy."" Above the din, tight end Zach Ertz bellowed, ""Club Dub,"" referencing the dance party that raged after Bears victories this season, all 12 of them. No strobe lights pulsing in the home locker room Sunday, only the harsh glare of the cameras. As Parkey's kick sank to the earth, the Bears' mascot, Staley Da Bear, perched beneath the crossbar, fell over. The camera panned to Chicago Coach Matt Nagy, who did not blink, his mouth agape.

In retrospect, the Bears' biggest blunder of the season came last week, when they beat the Vikings in the last week of the regular season. By winning in Minnesota -- where the Eagles captured their first Super Bowl, it should be noted -- the Bears granted Philadelphia's entry into the postseason. Chicago's reward, after going 12-4 to capture the N.F.C. North and the conference's third seed, was to face the reigning champions, who barged into the playoffs by winning five of their final six games -- the last three behind Foles, in relief, again, of an injured Carson Wentz. The Eagles have a quirky, if enviable, quarterback situation -- the franchise star in Wentz and the beloved backup in Foles, who merely secured Philadelphia's first football championship since 1960.

Since ascending to the starting job in Week 15 at Los Angeles -- where Wentz injured his knee last season -- Foles, unlikely to return to Philadelphia next season, has approached every game knowing it could be his last in an Eagles uniform. He tamed the Rams, then the Texans and the Redskins, but had not yet encountered a defense as dominant as Chicago's. Just how dominant? The Bears were the only team this season with more interceptions (27) than touchdown passes allowed (22). Even after Chicago added two more interceptions Sunday -- after the first 25 minutes, he had been picked off more times than in his previous four playoff games combined -- Foles remained at peace. ""What I've learned on these stages,"" Foles said, ""is just how to calm myself in a chaotic moment."" He simplifies. He gazes at 10 players he trusts in the huddle. He calls the play. With 4 minutes 48 seconds remaining and trailing by 15-10, Philadelphia took over at its 40 and in the huddle Foles simplified, gazed, trusted -- and found Alshon Jeffery for 15 yards. He guided the Eagles to the Bears' 2, converting a third-and-9 to Jeffery, before three straight plays backfired. Before fourth-and-their-season, Coach Doug Pederson signaled timeout. Expecting the Bears to blitz, Pederson called a play that would move the pocket for Foles, who rolled to his right and sidearmed a toss to Golden Tate, who caught it on the goal line and spun into the end zone with 56 seconds left.

And on Sunday, after Philadelphia missed the 2-point conversion, Foles, who completed 25 of 40 passes for 266 yards, watched Tarik Cohen ran back the ensuing kickoff 35 yards. ""That definitely came into my mind a little bit,"" Foles said of the New Orleans game. Mitch Trubisky, whose 22-yard touchdown pass to Allen Robinson with 9:04 left had put the Bears ahead by 15-10, directed the Bears to the Eagles' 25, where Parkey measured his fourth attempt of the day. His travails this season have unnerved Bears fans, who sulked as he missed 10 kicks -- seven field goals and three extra points. He drilled his initial try, but Philadelphia had called timeout before the kick to ice him. The second bounced off the yellow posts and onto the turf. When it was noted to Pederson at a news conference last week that Foles had not lost the last two Decembers (and beyond), Pederson banged the wooden lectern for, you know, luck. That was superfluous. He oversees a team that trampled favored New England in the Super Bowl, that has coalesced after a 48-7 defeat Nov. 18 in New Orleans, that outclassed the league's top defense on the road. The same Eagles group that donned dog masks last postseason -- at once lampooning their perceived underdog status and welcoming it -- has birthed a new wearable gimmick: ski masks. As if robbers, they started stealing the ball. Then they started stealing wins. Then they stole a playoff berth. Then they stole victory from the Bears. Ask the Eagles, and they say are not done. They have been down a similar path before, and found a trophy at the end. New Orleans, beware.","A potential winning field goal for Chicago clanged off an upright and the crossbar.

Global Business,A Stark Step Away From Europe,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/12/business/global/for-britain-another-step-away-from-europe.html,"LONDON -- Has Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain hurt his country's powerful financial services industry more than he has helped it? Many bankers and economists are pondering that question after Mr. Cameron's surprising decision last week to leave Britain out of a historic accord aimed at moving Europe closer to political as well as monetary union. Mr. Cameron said the pact lacked safeguards to protect the City of London, Britain's version of Wall Street, against future regulations that might not be in its best interests. And because France and Germany would not bend on his proposed protections, he would not sign on to their plan for more tightly coordinated oversight of European Union governments' revenue and spending. Now, though, some in Britain worry that the nation's ability to halt or shape what is expected to be a wave of future financial regulation from European Union headquarters will be severely constrained if Britain does not have a seat at the negotiating table. And so it remains to be seen whether the City financiers Mr. Cameron wanted to protect will eventually end up feeling grateful -- or marginalized.

To be sure, few believe that his decision represents an immediate and mortal blow to London's ambition to remain a center of international finance. Whatever banks and their overseers might eventually do on the Continent, much of the rest of the financial world -- including the money centers of New York, Hong Kong and Tokyo -- is likely to still see London as a primary node in the round-the-world, round-the-clock network. Britain's banks make more cross-border loans than those of any other country in the world, 18 percent of the global total. London is also home to the largest foreign exchange market in the world. And it remains the headquarters for the large banks that trade European sovereign debt, a business unlikely to go away any time soon. Financial machinery aside, language, habits and history suggest that London will continue to be a magnet for the globally minded. But some analysts nonetheless worry that Mr. Cameron's desire to espouse the stubbornly independent British bulldog could harm the City over the long term. ""This is the worst possible news -- the relative decline of the City of London relative to other financial centers in Europe is now a very real risk,"" said Graham Bishop, a former London banker who is a consultant on European financial and regulatory matters.

The decline will not happen at once, he argued. Europe is well aware that financial institutions in London have strong and deep links to the Continent. But Britain, whose refusal to adopt the euro currency has long put it somewhat at odds with the European Union's other biggest economies, appears to have estranged itself further from Europe's policy inner circle. With Britain now essentially having but one vote among 27 others in the European Union, the chipping away of London's competitive position will be inevitable, Mr. Bishop contended. Mr. Cameron has been cheered by the powerful faction of his Conservative Party that sees evil in all that Europe does. But it is unlikely that the constituency his veto was meant to protect -- banks, hedge funds and insurance companies operating in the City of London -- would welcome a further waning of Britain's ability to influence regulations from Brussels. Those executives, many of whom are French, German or Spanish, are a pragmatic, global lot. And they tend to shy away from public confrontation and wish only for an operating environment that continues to play to the City's strength: providing competitive banking and financial services to an increasingly global economy.

Until now, Britain has been able to assemble blocking minorities on measures it opposes. That happened, for example, with a recent proposal to raise revenue for European governments by taxing financial transactions -- a tax that would have put new fees on every trade of stocks, bonds and other financial instruments. It is not hard to understand why Mr. Cameron and Britain vehemently opposed that particular measure. The new tax would have been imposed on activities that occur in the City more often and at greater volume than anywhere else in Europe. But Britain will have less power to muster votes opposing financial and economic measures it does not like, starting in 2014 under European Union rule changes that would have been taking effect even without the new Brussels pact adopted last week. Currently, under voting rules in the European Union's council of ministers, a nearly three-quarters majority of votes is required to pass new measures, with the votes allocated among member nations on the basis of population. In this current setup, the 17-member euro zone by itself cannot muster a sufficient majority. That is a reason Britain has been able to help block measures it does not like. But come 2014, simple majority votes will suffice in the council of ministers. And the euro zone bloc by itself will wield a simple majority. So Britain was already on its way to losing veto power in the European Union -- even before Mr. Cameron's move last week gave it less of a voice in the debate. A basic gap between the euro zone nations and Britain is the widely held British view that for the City of London, home to the largest global banks in the world and 80 percent of Europe's hedge funds, a national regulatory approach is better than a European one. Britain would much prefer to have the Bank of England governor, Mervyn A. King -- whose highly skeptical view toward British banks is well known -- as its main regulator than a bureaucrat based in Brussels.

Britain, for example, has already proposed that its large banks should have higher capital requirements and split off their trading operations into separate businesses. Brussels opposes such measures, preferring a set of European Union rules. Open Europe, a London-based research house, points out that there are 49 new rules being discussed by Europe that could have an effect on the City of London. Some may not have a big financial impact on the City -- like the proposal by the European Central Bank to have the clearing of trades involving euro-denominated securities and other financial instruments performed only in countries that use the euro. But others, like the financial transactions tax, are not small items. That measure could be reintroduced in the future. And after 2014, Britain might be powerless to block it. Analysts say the global financial crisis, and its lingering effects in the sovereign debt woes of countries like Italy, have hardened European attitudes toward the Anglo-Saxon banking model that the City represents. That perception, more than any specific proposal yet on the table, may explain Mr. Cameron's fear that regulations costly to the City of London will be pushed through over Britain's objection. And yet, any realization of those fears might be far off. There have been no actual measures yet proposed to move material trading and financial activities away from London. And it is unlikely that large European financial institutions like Deutsche Bank and BNP Paribas will be in a rush to move their expansive London operations back home. What is more, many executives in the City expect Europe to be mainly focused in the coming months and years on trying to keep the euro zone intact, rather than pondering a frontal attack on London's financial services industry. ""All this is predicated that Europe can hold the euro zone together,"" said Derek Scott, a financial services executive in London and a former adviser to the British prime minister, Tony Blair. ""So the idea of Britain being isolated is not quite right -- this is going to be a prolonged slog between Britain and Europe.""",A move by David Cameron to protect the City of London underscores a growing distance between Britain and the European Union.,f877dbdb-873b-5571-b2ca-b53dfcb34a59,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/12/12/business/sub-city-1/sub-city-1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=350&w=600&s=f6bbbea52414204a3d2f2fd2e8afcc1ec4809dd348033e9ad6799d00f6db32e2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Supporters of the City of London fear a wave of future financial regulation from European Union headquarters.,f877dbdb-873b-5571-b2ca-b53dfcb34a59,N24News/imgs/f877dbdb-873b-5571-b2ca-b53dfcb34a59.jpg,24
Media,"After London Attack, Trump Again the Center of Partisan Media Combat",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/04/business/media/london-attack-trump-media-cnn-fox-news.html,"A CNN host called President Trump a ""man baby"" and a piece of excrement. (He used a more profane term, and later apologized.) A guest on ""Fox & Friends"" proposed that some Muslims in the United Kingdom be placed in internment camps, prompting an on-air disavowal from the hosts. A Breitbart News writer argued on Twitter that ""there would be no deadly attacks in the U.K. if Muslims didn't live there,"" generating angry replies. And Mr. Trump himself, in his first public comment about the attack in London on Saturday night, disseminated unconfirmed information from an unofficial source: The Drudge Report. In the 24 hours after the deadly van and knife attack, the cycle of partisan broadsides and ideological combat that seems to dominate the media universe these days kicked into high gear. News organizations turned against each other, with anchors on Fox News calling on CNN to punish its host Reza Aslan for his profane remarks about Mr. Trump in a Twitter post.

The president's retweet of a Drudge headline -- ""fears of new terror attack,"" it read, even as the nature of the assault remained unclear -- prompted a rebuke of sorts from NBC Nightly News, whose Twitter account pointedly noted that its journalists would not relay the president's retweet, ""as the info is unconfirmed."" That led to accusations of liberal bias, with the ""Fox & Friends"" co-host Abby Huntsman asking, ""Can we not just come together?"" It was the kind of chain reaction that is increasingly commonplace in a deeply polarized political environment, where news organizations attract tribal followings, and where major events like the London attack can stoke fears and inflame emotions -- from Mr. Trump on down. Mr. Aslan responded with his angry posts after the president, in the immediate wake of the attack on Saturday, wrote on Twitter that his proposed travel ban was needed to prevent terrorism. Mr. Aslan, an Iranian-American writer and religion scholar who hosts a weekly show about faith and society for CNN, also described Mr. Trump as ""an embarrassment to humankind."" That prompted expressions of outrage from right-wing news outlets like Breitbart News and the hosts of ""Fox & Friends"" on Sunday morning, who lamented his comment. CNN was already mired in an uproar over the comedian Kathy Griffin, a co-host of the network's New Year's Eve coverage, who posted a photograph in which she held a fake severed head meant to look like the president's; CNN severed ties with Ms. Griffin last week.

""I should have used better language to express my shock and frustration at the president's lack of decorum and sympathy,"" Mr. Aslan wrote in a statement on Sunday. ""I apologize for my choice of words."" (A spokeswoman for CNN added: ""That kind of discourse is never appropriate."")
* Retail earnings and Black Friday: the week in business.
* Elizabeth Holmes will resume her testimony in her fraud trial. The backlash against Mr. Trump's tweets, however, went beyond Mr. Aslan. Critics pointed to the president's criticism of London's mayor, Sadiq Khan, noting that Mr. Trump had taken a quote from the mayor out of context to suggest that he was unconcerned about terrorism. There was also some disbelief in online comments that the president, who has access to up-to-the-minute national intelligence, chose to send a speculative item from The Drudge Report to his 31.5 million Twitter followers on an issue of international import. The Drudge Report, which is hugely popular with conservatives, counts Mr. Trump among its devotees: @Drudge_Report is just one of 45 Twitter accounts that he follows. On ""Fox & Friends,"" a reliably Trump-friendly morning show, there was little concern over the president's tweets, but some criticism of Mr. Aslan's remark, which the hosts described as evidence of an explicit bias against Mr. Trump in some quarters of the news media. It was not long until the ""Fox & Friends"" crew was coping with its own troubles. One of the show's guest commentators, Katie Hopkins of The Daily Mail, raised the prospect of rounding up Muslims on the terrror watch list in the United Kingdom and placing them in internment camps as a way of preventing future attacks. Another guest -- Nigel Farage, the British political figure and ""Brexit"" advocate who is now a Fox News contributor -- also mentioned the idea of internment. Later in the broadcast, the ""Fox & Friends"" anchors paused for a formal denunciation of the statements, lest viewers be left with the impression that Fox was endorsing the idea. ""On behalf of the network, I think all of us here find that idea reprehensible here at Fox News Channel, just to be clear,"" a co-host, Clayton Morris, told viewers.",News organizations turned against each other as Fox News anchors called on CNN to punish its host Reza Aslan for profane remarks about President Trump.,861478d7-aeb3-5765-94e7-9f696f75584a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/05/business/05TRUMPMEDIA/05TRUMPMEDIA-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=329&w=628&s=875c08fcf41f920eec9b9ce3d1c372828b3eb867ec8237cd522c4ed87db0f3d6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The hosts of ""Fox & Friends,"" top, lamented a CNN host's profane comment about President Trump.

Science,NASA Launched a Rocket 54 Years Ago. Has It Finally Come Home?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/science/nasa-rocket-orbit.html,"A Centaur second-stage rocket at NASA's Lewis Research Center (now the John H. Glenn Research Center) in Ohio in the 1960s. Centaur, paired with the Atlas booster rocket, launched with the Surveyor moon missions.





Dec. 2: This article has been updated with information about additional observations completed by astronomers after it was published. It was after midnight on Sept. 19 and Paul Chodas, the manager of the Center for Near Earth Object Studies at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., was working late, studying an object called 2020 SO that other astronomers had spotted in the night skies just the day before. Something about its orbit was peculiar. The computer program he was working with showed that 2020 SO followed a nearly circular path just slightly outside our planet's orbit. And the plane of the object's orbit was just barely tilted relative to Earth's. ""I was suspicious immediately,"" he said. Out of curiosity, Dr. Chodas ran his simulation in reverse. With time dialing backward, he watched 2020 SO pass very near Earth in September 1966. ""Close enough that it could have originated from the Earth,"" he said. At 1:12 a.m., Dr. Chodas acted on his hunch, and sent an email to fellow astronomers with a subject line of ""2020 SO = Surveyor 2 Centaur r/b?"" In the months that followed, amateur skywatchers and professional astronomers alike have been tracking this specter with their telescopes, following what many now believe is a rocket booster that flew toward the moon more than 50 years ago during a failed NASA mission.

On Tuesday, the object, now temporarily orbiting Earth, made its closest pass. Scientists around the world took advantage of that alignment, and the new observations have revealed conclusive evidence that the dot on their monitors really is a ghost of the Cold War moon race. Hopes were high when Surveyor 2 lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Fla. (then known as Cape Kennedy), on Sept. 20, 1966. NASA designed the roughly one-ton lunar lander to collect images of the moon in preparation for the Apollo missions. It was following close on the heels of its successful predecessor, Surveyor 1, launched just a few months earlier, which had landed on the moon and returned over 11,000 images. Surveyor 1 performed flawlessly, said Mike Dinn, then the deputy station director of Australia's Tidbinbilla Tracking Station, where giant radio antennas communicated with the spacecraft during its journey. ""We fully expected Surveyor 2 to be a complete success."" But it wasn't -- the spacecraft crashed into the moon. Its death knell came roughly 16 hours after launch, when one of the three small engines attached to the spacecraft's legs failed to fire. The imbalanced thrust sent Surveyor 2 into a spin, and after 38 unsuccessful attempts to revive the engine it became clear that the mission could not be salvaged. Mr. Dinn and his colleagues at Tidbinbilla were the last people to communicate with the spacecraft.

Fast-forward 54 years. On Sept. 17, one of the Pan-STARRS telescopes near the summit of Haleakala on Maui, which search for asteroids and other objects that may pose a risk to Earth, recorded something moving across the sky. It traced out a small arc, which caught the attention of astronomers reviewing the data the next morning. ""Whenever you see an object that moves in a slightly curved path in the sky, it has to be close,"" said Richard Wainscoat, an astronomer at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and a Pan-STARRS team member. Dr. Wainscoat and his colleagues reported their discovery to the Minor Planet Center, a clearinghouse for observations of asteroids, comets and other small bodies. On Sept. 18, the Minor Planet Center issued an announcement about the new object, naming it 2020 SO. Within a few hours, Dr. Chodas was studying the object, and eventually poring over records of space launches in 1966 that aligned with the orbital path his computer program had mapped out. He quickly found Surveyor 2. Although the robotic spacecraft was destroyed when it hit the moon, the second stage of the Atlas-Centaur rocket that carried it to space had been jettisoned a few minutes after launch. After flying by the moon, the roughly 25-foot-long cylindrical booster had disappeared into space. In the email he sent to colleagues, Dr. Chodas explained his conclusion that 2020 SO was very likely the Centaur rocket booster from Surveyor 2.

Since September, scientists around the world have been investigating 2020 SO. Vishnu Reddy, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, and Adam Battle, a graduate student there, compared observations of 2020 SO with a known Centaur rocket booster orbiting just a few hundred miles above Earth. The optical colors matched, Dr. Reddy said, but sealing the deal would require infrared observations of 2020 SO. At those wavelengths, it's a ""slam dunk"" to compare objects' compositions. ""There's very little ambiguity in the infrared,"" Dr. Reddy said.

The orbit of 2020 SO is also ever so slightly anomalous, deviating from what is expected based on gravity alone, said Davide Farnocchia, an asteroid dynamicist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. That may shed light on its identity. The cause of that irregularity is most likely the pressure exerted by solar radiation. Particles of sunlight -- photons -- have energy, and they exert a force when they collide with something, Dr. Farnocchia said. ""They cause a gentle push away from the sun."" The fact that 2020 SO is being shoved around by sunlight suggests that it's something relatively large and low mass, like an empty rocket booster, as opposed to something small and massive, like a rocky asteroid. Dr. Farnocchia compared the phenomenon with the wind. ""If you have an empty soda can, you're going to move it much farther,"" he said. ""If you have a solid rock, it's much harder to push it away.""",Surveyor 2 crashed on the moon in 1966.

Style,"How to Hack Your Brain (for $5,000)",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/style/what-is-flow.html,"EDEN, Utah -- One morning last month a group of roughly 60 people, including doctors, C.E.O.s and internet entrepreneurs, gathered under a big white dome to hear the mission statement of their host, a 45-year-old man named Jamie Wheal. As he paced back and forth in front of an altar bearing shiny Buddha heads, Mr. Wheal talked about the perils of information overload in our content-rich era. ""A literate person in the European Middle Ages,"" he said, ""consumed the same amount of content in their entire lives as we do reading a single edition of the Sunday New York Times."" Sinewy and tanned from a life of outdoor pursuits, Mr. Wheal was offering attendees the chance to ""upgrade"" their nervous systems to meet this incontrovertible information overload. How? With ""flow."" First popularized decades ago by the Hungarian psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, flow is an elusive state cultivated by artists, athletes and others, that of being so absorbed in what they're doing that they lose track of time and thought, finding themselves guided rather by instinct and intuition. It has also been referred to as the Zone -- not to be confused with the diet of the same name -- or just ""being in the moment."" And for those who have experienced it, there is no denying its magic.

Mr. Wheal has taken a somewhat brisker, more commercial approach. He has advised members of the United States Navy Special Operations, top-ranked athletes and executives of technology companies on ""optimizing performance"" through flow, receiving six-figure fees for some of his consultations. His five-day retreat, at a sprawling, privately held property known as Summit and convened the day before the solar eclipse, cost almost $5,000 and was a sort of beta test for spreading his gospel to a larger public audience. (He also offers free assessments and videos on his website.) Attendees were housed in white tepee-like tents, with portable toilets set up down a dirt path. The camp had been erected quickly by the ""glamping"" company Aether Camp, to Mr. Wheal's specifications.

Mr. Wheal, who said his father was a test pilot for the British royal navy, came to the United States from England at age 8 and speaks rapidly in a mash-up accent, dropping idiosyncratic phrases and erudite references to the Soviet psychologist Lev Vygotsky, to Cincinnatus and Aldous Huxley. At moments he is given to phrases that are not immediately comprehensible, like ""We are broaching the possibility of midwifing humanity into the infinite game."" But his larger message came through clearly. In our digital age, loud with bottom-feeder commentary, the ping of incoming emails and bleating social media, the pursuit of flow is all the more urgent. ""Honestly, have we abdicated our purpose just because of these insistent micro asks?"" Mr. Wheal said. ""Have we just completely ceded our center, completely ceded clarity, and it was all just based on 20-something bro-grammers trying to crack our attention spans?""

It was his book, ""Stealing Fire,"" written with Mr. Kotler and published earlier this year, that attracted many of the flow campers to Utah. In it, Mr. Wheal and Mr. Kotler consider the question of peak human performance, describing how so many powerful companies and individuals are now trying to optimize their own brains, in ways both legal and illegal. They offer case studies from the Navy SEALs and Google, arguing that what the world today faces ""wicked problems,"" unprecedented and complex, that require creative solutions, the kinds that are most likely to come not from staid meetings in conference rooms but rather from ""non-ordinary states."" ""Flow,"" they write, is associated with six neurotransmitters: dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin, norepinephrine, anandamide and endorphins. Knowing the neurochemical profile of flow means, in theory, people can devise ways of achieving it more often, more reliably and more quickly. The new generation of flowsters are excited, perhaps, that using the advances of neuroscience, they might not have to meditate every day for 10 years to gain access to these layers of their brains.

Reading ""Stealing Fire,"" Mr. Lang-Willar said, he became convinced that nothing less than a ""cultural awakening"" was underway. By 8 a.m. each morning, the flow campers lay prone and shoeless in the Dojo Dome, moving back and forth on brightly colored foam rollers. Other daily activities included balancing and bouncing on big yellow balls; acro-yoga, in which partners learn to lift each other in the air; and strapping into special contraptions, like Mr. Wheal's 360 Swing, which allows those courageous enough to propel themselves, standing up, all the way around the swing's axle in a complete loop. All of these undertakings were in the service of honing a crucial element in flow, what Mr. Wheal refers to as ""embodied cognition"": integrating our whole minds and bodies through specific exercise, based on the science showing that physical movement directly affects how we think and feel. ""They are tapping into spiritual intelligence that before now was only really talked about in a religious context,"" Kristen Ulmer said, sitting outside the Dojo Dome one morning. Ms. Ulmer, formerly the top ranked extreme skier in the world, has also written a book, ""The Art of Fear.""

On the third night of camp, attendees gathered in the Dojo Dome for a night of heavy breathing. On their backs, as the lights changed colors and music pulsed from the speakers, they practiced a technique developed by the psychiatrist Stanislav Grof, involving intense hyperventilation for 15 minutes. People were transported into altered states, gyrating their pelvises, bursting into peals of unrestrained, almost feral laughter, even leaping to their feet to dance. The group had succeeded, Mr. Wheal announced afterward, in ""defragging our nervous systems."" In addition to exercise, lectures and breathing, there were some fairly X-rated activities on the program. One evening after dinner, Mr. Wheal spoke about a set of sexual practices that he has found particularly effective for transporting oneself well outside of humdrum daily rhythms. (They are further detailed in a chapter of ""Stealing Fire"" called ""Taking the Kink out of Kinky."") All of these are what Mr. Wheal calls, apologetically, ""hacks"": techniques for busting out of the overwhelmed modern condition into a place of creativity, passion, focus, tranquillity, vitality and self-refinement. ""The genius of what we're doing here is we're combining ideas about how to get into flow with actually doing physical things to experience it,"" said Kora Kinard, 29, an orgasmic meditation practitioner from San Francisco who attended. ""The flow state and the orgasm state are very connected."" Indeed, Mr. Wheal, having wearied somewhat of the term ""flow,"" prefers ""ecstasis,"" an ancient Greek term for ""stepping beyond oneself.""

The neuro-chemicals that define flow or ecstasis are powerfully alluring, and Mr. Wheal warned they are not always used for good. He argues, for instance, that Donald J. Trump instinctively knew how to manipulate them in gathering support for his presidency. ""Trump hacked ecstasis,"" Mr. Wheal said. ""Light, sound, movement, repetition, scapegoating the other. People said if you haven't been to his rallies, you're missing what's actually happening in this movement. And what does Hillary say? 'I've got a policy binder.' While Trump pulled all the strings."" Politics aside, Mr. Wheal suggests that we seek daily not a fleeting non-ordinary hour or two, but rather, a permanently altered mind-set. A trait, not a state, a means of incorporating these methods into our lives so that flow, or ecstasis, is threaded through all our months and years. Flow camp ended with a shoeless closing ceremony, with participants sitting cross-legged in a circle passing a tiny sculpture of Tara, the female Bodhisattva, from person to person and sharing memories of their experiences that week. The room was thick with emotion and warmth.

But the last thing Mr. Wheal wants to produce, he said, are more ""bliss junkies and epiphany whores,"" for whom he reserves a particular antipathy. It's not enough, in other words, to eat magic mushrooms, experience oneness with nature and humanity, cuddle a Buddha statue and then go right back to how things were. Or, for that matter, to parachute into Burning Man -- where many of the flow campers were heading next -- melt down your ego on the playa, and then fail to integrate the experience into the rest of your life. ""Everyone lines up for the peak experience,"" Mr. Wheal said. ""But no one does their push-ups on Monday morning.""","The new, new, new age is all about ""defragging our nervous systems.""",f36d38bc-578c-5bd9-a910-b4526a6173e3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/21/fashion/21FLOWCAMPweb4/21FLOWCAMPweb4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=4f2c55ae2088d81ec09bf802d64f616109c54c0b3ec9550de75fcff927005268&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jamie Wheal speaking to participants on the last night of Flow Camp in the ""Flow Dojo"" at Powder Mountain, Utah.",f36d38bc-578c-5bd9-a910-b4526a6173e3,N24News/imgs/f36d38bc-578c-5bd9-a910-b4526a6173e3.jpg,15
Health,"Herpes Is Slowly Retreating, but the Infection Remains Common",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/health/herpes-infection-rate.html,"The prevalence of both genital and oral herpes simplex virus infections has declined steadily since 2000. Still, roughly half of middle-aged Americans are infected.

HSV-1, or oral herpes, causes cold sores around the mouth and face, and sometimes genital sores. HSV-2, genital herpes, is sexually transmitted, and causes sores around the genitals, buttocks and anus. HSV-2 can sometimes cause mouth sores as well.

Both types of herpes are transmitted by direct contact with an infected person; some infected people have no symptoms.

Oral herpes is usually acquired early in childhood or adolescence from nonsexual contact with saliva. It can be spread to the genitals through oral sex. Genital herpes is spread by vaginal, anal or oral sex with an infected person.","About half of Americans aged 14 to 49 have HSV-1 or HSV-2.

Style,Is This the Breakout Star of Virtual Fitness?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/style/self-care/isaac-calpito-torchd-workout.html,"Every morning, Isaac Calpito sets the stage in the East Hampton living room of his friend Stephanie DiTullio. Mr. Calpito, 39, is dressed, often, in sparkling yoga tights and a tank top that show his muscles to good advantage. His main prop is an iPhone. At 11 a.m. sharp, accompanied by a new playlist chosen by Ms. DiTullio (a.k.a D.J. Steph), he turns on Instagram Live and welcomes thousands of housebound fitness buffs and at least one Real Housewife, all of whom tune in to take part in (or at least watch) Mr. Calpito's Torch'd workout. For 45 minutes, the music pumps as he cycles through push-ups and squats, giving cheeky tough-love directions. At a time when it's difficult to introduce a new product or a business, Torch'd has become, rather organically, the breakthrough workout of the stay-at-home era. Mr. Calpito has been leading the classes virtually since March 17. Last week, about 2,500 people tuned in every day. The video of each class remains accessible on Instagram for 24 hours, and he said an additional 17,500 people typically tune in during that time. (On three occasions, Mr. Calpito has broadcast on a split screen that showed the actress Vanessa Hudgens and Lisa Rinna, a star of ""The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,"" doing their Torch'd workout. Each of those classes attracted about 8,000 live viewers. The last time Mr. Calpito featured Ms. Hudgens, more than 250,000 people watched during the 24-hour period.)

After getting Torch'd, you're likely to wake up sore the next day. But Mr. Calpito's constant monologue keeps exercisers coming back. ""A lot of you are so preoccupied with whether to point or flex your toes,"" he said during one session earlier this month. ""Just move your damn leg, OK? Like, you're not auditioning for American Ballet Theater. Those days are gone. Just torch that"" rear end, he said. Alas, it's difficult to quote Mr. Calpito's mid-class soliloquy without running into a word that rhymes with ""sass."" ""This one's for you, Taylor, and every boy who ever broke my heart,"" he said recently, while doing tush-toning leg circles as a Taylor Swift song played. He cursed his exes, then continued his instruction: ""Now carve out that real estate, baby!"" There will also be the occasional wry, off-topic cultural observation (""When did all the gays get married? It's so confusing to me""). The trainer coos over his poodle, named Davis after Bette, who prances into the frame from time to time, often wearing a red Gucci cardigan. ""He's a bit fancy. I try to keep him humble and remind him that his father grew up on food stamps,"" said Mr. Calpito, who was raised by a family of humble means in Waimanalo, Hawaii, a small town on the island of Oahu.

Davis preens as Mr. Calpito keeps his own legs suspended an inch off the ground for an excruciating amount of time and tells you that you should be doing the same. This is unlikely but the chaos keeps the eye on the screen and the cruncher or jumping-jacker from quitting altogether. Then there are the emojis and comments from bold-faced Instagram handles, cascading down the screen as Mr. Calpito calls out names. ""Hey Vanessa Hudgens!"" ""What's up, Michael Rapaport?"" ""Hey Christy Turlington!"" ""Hey Jessica Chastain, how's your grandma?""(It's a mystery how the constantly mentioned Lizzie Tisch is able to text so much while she's purportedly in plank position.) Thus he manages to approximate the feel of sweating in a packed room alongside friends and strangers, some of whom might be rich and famous. Mr. Calpito's success has been a long time coming, according to his friends and fans. ""Isaac is one of the most entertaining people you will ever meet,"" said Kelly Ripa, who has known him for 18 years and who last month gave him the ""Live with Kelly and Ryan"" bump when she told viewers that she's been taking his Torch'd classes on Instagram. ""I just think he's tapped into the moment,"" Ms. Ripa said in an interview. ""He's put the fun into working out and the community back into the lives of people. He's made a great big alienated, desolate world feel very small, and all you need is your phone.""

As a boy who loved dance and theater, Mr. Calpito was bullied, but kept at it, encouraged by his grandmother and mother. In 1998, just after graduating from high school, he booked a one-way flight for New York. He slept on the floors of friends' dorm rooms, hit audition after audition and got his first big gig within six months, as part of the touring cast for ""Mamma Mia."" In 2003, he joined the ensemble of the Broadway production. ""Six years of eight shows a week,"" he said. ""It's a tight-knit family on Broadway. I learned discipline, compassion and the importance of community."" He next was cast in the 2009 Broadway revival of ""West Side Story."" The production was directed by Arthur Laurents, who wrote the book for the original musical back in the 1950s. ""Arthur became a very important mentor for me,"" Mr. Calpito said. ""He kept me on track for bigger goals. He was a father figure."" It was during the production that Mr. Calpito created a floor-exercise circuit to give himself a full-body workout when he had no time to go to the gym. ""I created this flow and this method that I knew would work for me, and I did it alone every day on the stage of the Palace Theater with my boom box with Madonna playing before performances,"" he said. ""Before long, other castmates started doing it with me."" After the show closed in 2011, Mr. Calpito moved to Los Angeles to work as a choreographer for pop stars like Ariana Grande and a fitness trainer for celebrities including Faye Dunaway. In 2015 he began working as a SoulCycle instructor in New York. He left the company in 2019 and has focused on private sessions and Torch'd since, leading classes at Art Basel.","Isaac Calpito is ""torching"" Real Housewives's rear ends for charity, and you too can join in the fun.",af5cdfc8-79f6-54c2-902f-a5d945cceea0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/28/fashion/25INSTAGRAMTRAINER-1/25INSTAGRAMTRAINER-1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=319c9286d73b1489ae05e635729ec44ac9536bf9e73b1b1ff243a32c6463dade&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Getting a leg up: Isaac Calpito with his poodle, Davis (after Bette).",af5cdfc8-79f6-54c2-902f-a5d945cceea0,N24News/imgs/af5cdfc8-79f6-54c2-902f-a5d945cceea0.jpg,15
Movies,'Circus of Books' Review: A Community Takes Pride in Its Porn Store,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/movies/circus-of-books-review.html,"Internet killed the video store in the documentary ""Circus of Books,"" which examines the history of a long-running porn shop and adult goods store in West Hollywood that closed in 2019. When the film begins, Circus of Books is on its last legs. But 30 years ago, it was not only one of the biggest distributors of gay pornography in the area, but also one of largest gay porn producers in the country. Perhaps the most surprising piece of the story was that it was run by Karen and Barry Mason -- a straight couple who kept it a secret from their synagogue, friends and family.

The documentary (streaming on Netflix) is directed by the couple's daughter, Rachel, and it promises an inside view of the pair's double life. But as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that the people who are least equipped to thoroughly profile Karen and Barry are their children. The family business went undiscussed at home for years; even though the curtain has since been drawn, Karen and Barry still compartmentalize. They are strictly business when they discuss their most impossible decisions, even shrugging off the choice -- presented as Karen's to make -- to have only Barry face the charges brought against them during the Reagan administration's crusades against obscenity.",A woman's documentary on the gay pornography and adult goods shop her parents ran for three decades brims with warm remembrances by those who frequented it.,62cb90b1-28e3-5f98-82cf-d9eec47bb656,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/23/arts/23circusof/merlin_171690303_b3a7c4dd-2f72-4611-a8ce-bc36d3835d53-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=94666ee96aa4108725df9eb9e0090f6cd17f2110d7a85faf14fd41bfe34e62b0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Karen and Barry Mason, the couple who ran the Circus of Books gay pornography and adult goods store in West Hollywood for three decades.",62cb90b1-28e3-5f98-82cf-d9eec47bb656,N24News/imgs/62cb90b1-28e3-5f98-82cf-d9eec47bb656.jpg,5
Education,"The Machines Are Learning, and So Are the Students",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/education/artificial-intelligence-tutors-teachers.html,"This article is part of our continuing Fast Forward series, which examines technological, economic, social and cultural shifts that happen as businesses evolve. Jennifer Turner's algebra classes were once sleepy affairs, and a lot of her students struggled to stay awake. Today, they are active and engaged, thanks to new technologies, including an artificial intelligence-powered program that is helping her teach. She uses the platform Bakpax that can read students' handwriting and auto-grade schoolwork, and she assigns lectures for students to watch online while they are at home. Using the platform has provided Mrs. Turner, 41, who teaches at the Gloucester County Christian School in Sewell, N.J., more flexibility in how she teaches, reserving class time for interactive exercises. ""The grades for homework have been much better this year because of Bakpax,"" Mrs. Turner said. ""Students are excited to be in my room, they're telling me they love math, and those are things that I don't normally hear.""

For years, people have tried to re-engineer learning with artificial intelligence, but it was not until the machine-learning revolution of the past seven years that real progress has been made. Slowly, algorithms are making their way into classrooms, taking over repetitive tasks like grading, optimizing coursework to fit individual student needs and revolutionizing the preparation for College Board exams like the SAT. A plethora of online courses and tutorials also have freed teachers from lecturing and allowed them to spend class time working on problem solving with students instead. While that trend is helping people like Mrs. Turner teach, it has just begun. Researchers are using A.I. to understand how the brain learns and are applying it to systems that they hope will make it easier and more enjoyable for students to study. Machine-learning-powered systems not only track students' progress, spot weaknesses and deliver content according to their needs, but will soon incorporate humanlike interfaces that students will be able to converse with as they would a teacher. ""Education, I think, is going to be the killer app for deep learning,"" said Terrence Sejnowski, who runs the Computational Neurobiology Laboratory at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif., and also is the president of the Neural Information Processing Systems Foundation, which each year puts on the largest machine-learning conference in the world.

The first computer tutoring systems appeared in the 1960s, presenting material in short segments, asking students questions as they moved through the material and providing immediate feedback on answers. Because they were expensive and computers far from ubiquitous, they were largely confined to research institutes. By the 1970s and 1980s systems began using rule-based artificial intelligence and cognitive theory. These systems led students through each step of a problem, giving hints from expert knowledge bases. But rule-based systems failed because they were not scalable -- it was expensive and tedious to program extensive domain expertise. Since then, most computer teaching systems have been based on decision trees, leading students through a preprogrammed learning path determined by their performance -- if they get a question right, they are sent in one direction, and if they get the question wrong, they are sent in another. The system may look like it is adapting to the student, but it is actually just leading the student along a preset path.

But the machine-learning revolution is changing that. Today, learning algorithms uncover patterns in large pools of data about how students have performed on material in the past and optimize teaching strategies accordingly. They adapt to the student's performance as the student interacts with the system. Bakpax asks teachers to notify parents how their children's data will be used, and parents can opt out. But Bakpax and other companies say they mask identities and encrypt the data they do collect. Studies show that these systems can raise student performance well beyond the level of conventional classes and even beyond the level achieved by students who receive instruction from human tutors. A.I. tutors perform better, in part, because a computer is more patient and often more insightful. One of the first commercial applications of machine learning to teaching was by the company Knewton, founded by Jose Ferreira, a former executive at the private education company Kaplan. Knewton uses a mix of learning algorithms to evaluate students and match material to their needs.

""After a few questions we could very quickly figure out what level you are at and the optimal piece of content for teaching,"" Mr. Ferreira said. ""The more you worked with the system, the better our profile of you got and the more we could give you better and better content."" Nonetheless, Knewton ran into financial difficulties and was sold in May to the education publisher Wiley. Mr. Ferreira said the company's troubles were not because its technology did not work, but because the company had relied heavily on one customer, which dropped Knewton in favor of an in-house system. Mr. Ferreira, 51, left to start Bakpax. At its core, Bakpax is a computer vision system that converts handwriting to text and interprets what the student meant to say. The system's auto-grader teaches itself how to score. ""Instead of handing your homework in, you just take a picture of it on your phone, and a few seconds later we can tell you what you got right and what you got wrong,"" Mr. Ferreira said. ""We can even tell you what the right answer is for the ones you got wrong."" Mrs. Turner said her students loved the immediacy. The system also gathers data over time that allows teachers to see where a class is having trouble or compare one class's performance with another. ""There's a lot of power in all this information that, right now, literally is just thrown in the trash every day,"" Mr. Ferreira said.

Riiid claims students can increase their scores by 20 percent or more with just 20 hours of study. It has already incorporated machine-learning algorithms into its program to prepare students for English-language proficiency tests and has introduced test prep programs for the SAT. It expects to enter the United States in 2020. Still more transformational applications are being developed that could revolutionize education altogether. Acuitus, a Silicon Valley start-up, has drawn on lessons learned over the past 50 years in education -- cognitive psychology, social psychology, computer science, linguistics and artificial intelligence -- to create a digital tutor that it claims can train experts in months rather than years. Acuitus's system was originally funded by the Defense Department's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for training Navy information technology specialists. John Newkirk, the company's co-founder and chief executive, said Acuitus focused on teaching concepts and understanding. The company has taught nearly 1,000 students with its course on information technology and is in the prototype stage for a system that will teach algebra. Dr. Newkirk said the underlying A.I. technology was content-agnostic and could be used to teach the full range of STEM subjects. Dr. Newkirk likens A.I.-powered education today to the Wright brothers' early exhibition flights -- proof that it can be done, but far from what it will be a decade or two from now. The world will still need schools, classrooms and teachers to motivate students and to teach social skills, teamwork and soft subjects like art, music and sports. The challenge for A.I.-aided learning, some people say, is not the technology, but bureaucratic barriers that protect the status quo. ""There are gatekeepers at every step,"" said Dr. Sejnowski, who together with Barbara Oakley, a computer-science engineer at Michigan's Oakland University, created a massive open online course, or MOOC, called ""Learning How to Learn."" He said that by using machine-learning systems and the internet, new education technology would bypass the gatekeepers and go directly to students in their homes. ""Parents are figuring out that they can get much better educational lessons for their kids through the internet than they're getting at school,"" he said. Craig S. Smith is a former correspondent for The Times and hosts the podcast Eye on A.I.","Artificial intelligence is starting to take over repetitive tasks in classrooms, like grading, and is optimizing coursework and revolutionizing the preparation for college entrance exams.",0bf8d3d2-1fc8-560a-96c2-e416ed5f777c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/18/multimedia/18sp-ff-edai-1/18sp-ff-edai-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=f421d4da2f573f31c015b895dfc195f7d3f59aba65ab0d01c5227173f4a06f88&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jennifer Turner, an algebra teacher at Gloucester County Christian School in Sewell, N.J., uses an artificial intelligence-powered program that is helping her teach.",0bf8d3d2-1fc8-560a-96c2-e416ed5f777c,N24News/imgs/0bf8d3d2-1fc8-560a-96c2-e416ed5f777c.jpg,22
