Technology,The Sun Sets. The Wind Dies. But Energy Data Is Relentless.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/technology/personaltech/the-sun-sets-the-wind-dies-but-energy-data-is-relentless.html,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Ivan Penn, who covers alternative energy for The Times from Los Angeles, discussed the tech he's using. Q. A lot of alternative energy is basically technology. What are some of the most unusual ideas around alternative energy you've seen break out over the years? A. Much of the energy sector these days focuses on energy storage -- that's where a lot of innovation is taking place. Because solar and wind energy are intermittent, utilities look for ways to capture the unused power for when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow. Lithium-ion batteries are commonly known, but engineers are also working on storing compressed air generated by using excess solar and wind and releasing it later to power a turbine. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power proposes to turn Hoover Dam into a giant battery by making it a hydro-pumped storage plant. The dam already generates electricity, but the utility wants to pump water back into the upper reservoir to produce more electricity using solar and wind electricity to power the pump -- another form of storage.

But storage isn't the only focus. Engineers continue to study other forms of energy, like capturing the power of ocean waves. And some countries are using the internet for peer-to-peer electricity trading of the solar power they generate. Battery technology is something that everyone wants to see improve. What are the challenges to broader deployment of batteries in the energy sector? The biggest issue has been cost. Batteries have been very expensive, but that's changing fairly quickly. Just as with the rapid drop in price in solar panels, batteries to store electricity have rapidly declined in cost, most likely making them more affordable within the next few years.

How has tech changed the power grid as a whole? Just in the last decade, the 100-year model of utilities producing electricity and selling power to consumers was turned on its head. Improvements in solar panel efficiency and lower product cost enabled consumers on a wide scale to produce their own power and sell it back to the electric grid. The grid was never designed to be a two-way street. So that has led to a reimagining of it. Utility companies must rethink the services they provide. No longer just power companies, utilities provide new services like vehicle charging stations for the growing number of electric cars. Along with producing their own power, people now benefit from improvements in energy efficiency, which has resulted in flat or reduced electricity use across the country -- another adjustment for the power companies. Light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, highly efficient appliances and smart technology have changed the way we use power. What kind of tech setup do you have for work? The alternative energy beat often is data driven, so tech is critical. Google Sheets and Excel help me manage data from the United States Energy Information Administration, the Solar Energy Industries Association and the California Solar and Storage Association.

Outside of work, what tech do you and your family love? How do you use it? Our house is full of computers, mostly Apple -- MacBooks, iPads and iPhones -- though we use other tablets as well. The gadgets get their fair share of schoolwork activity, but they're also tools of social media, music, art, websites, programming, Hulu and Netflix. Entertainment is big. So there are several gaming systems, old and more recent, like various Nintendo systems as well as Xbox. But as if all of that weren't enough, my sons built their own computer with money they made during the summer at a fast food chicken restaurant so they could play and make video games they hope to sell. So far they're planning more than developing, but perhaps that might fall under the category of research. How has the tech industry swept into Los Angeles? And how has the city changed as a result? Without a doubt, energy technology is a staple of Southern California, given that the state is the leader in solar power. Residential solar is prolific. But technology is really changing transportation. Of course, there are Uber and Lyft, but electric vehicles have also given rise to new companies like Tesloop, which will take you from Los Angeles to San Diego in a Tesla for as little as $29 (snacks included). Prices go as high as about $84, and all users have to do is register and request a ride online. My daughter sometimes uses the service to get to and from the University of California, San Diego, where she goes to school, or uses ride shares through social media. And the Bird app, which connects people with electric scooters, has become increasingly popular, and perhaps annoying to some. Some areas have banned riding and parking the scooters in their communities. It has changed much of how people live, move and interact.","Alternative power sources have upended the electric grid.

Hala (Geraldine Viswanathan) is a 17-year-old Pakistani-American. She wears a hijab, she skateboards, and she prefers morning masturbation to morning prayers. This awkward Chicago teenager's story could easily have been shaped to fit a typical coming-of-age rebellion film: She has strict parents, has a crush on a boy they wouldn't like, and is sneaking around with him anyway. Instead of playing the scenario for laughs, though, the director Minhal Baig treats her character's hyphenated identity and her search for independence with quiet respect. Baig, who is Muslim and grew up in Chicago, drew upon her own senior year of high school for the film.

If you thought we were already at peak true crime, behold: a fictional series about making true crime media. Kathleen Barber's novel ""Are You Sleeping"" portrays a true-crime podcaster as a heartless vulture, but this adaptation is very much on the podcaster's side. (Sarah Koenig, of ""Serial"" fame, consulted on the show.) Octavia Spencer plays Poppy Parnell, a Bay Area journalist who doubts the evidence that convicted a teenager of murder some 20 years ago. She creates a ""Serial""-style podcast series, which asks the audience to reconsider the case, too (Spencer has Poppy's intimate podcast vocal delivery down pat). Her efforts to free the long-incarcerated Warren Cave (Aaron Paul) are not universally welcomed -- the police, the victim's relatives and even Poppy's own family all have objections, but Poppy plows on.

The serial killer Henry Lee Lucas has taught law enforcement a couple of embarrassing lessons. First, don't offer your perp strawberry milkshakes in exchange for each confession of murder. Second, don't give him case files to study and crime-scene clues to stir his ""memory."" This five-part documentary examines how Texas Rangers and detectives from 40 other states botched the Lucas investigation with these techniques in the early 1980s. Lucas claimed to have randomly murdered more than 600 people around the country (an imaginary spree that was the basis for the 1986 movie ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer""). Police kept questioning him about thousands of cases, despite increasing indications that Lucas was making it all up. Authorities now believe Lucas's kills were actually in the single or double digits, meaning hundreds of murders to which he'd confessed were returned into the vast sea of unsolved homicides. In Noah Baumbach's new film, a divorce lawyer played by Alan Alda characterizes the sundering of marital bonds as ""a death without a body."" But the way it plays out here, between the actress Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and her theater-director husband Charlie (Adam Driver), divorce is more like a love autopsy. The couple starts off wanting an amicable split, but once the expensive lawyers are involved, every stray comment or innocent mistake is scrutinized and weaponized, the story of their marriage rewritten with each cast as the villain to the other. Baumbach's unflinching examination of the imploding union spares neither party, and Johansson and Driver's commitment to their characters is devastating.

The standup comic Ronny Chieng has a lot on his mind, including politics, civil liberties, immigration, consumerism, subway etiquette and wedding planning. But Chieng is at his most incisive when he's blowing up stereotypes: Why do Asian-American immigrants want their first-generation children to become doctors, but then neglect to see doctors themselves? What if Asian-Americans became the impartial referees of all disputes among other races? (""No hatred, just solutions."") And what would it be like if an Asian-American were voted into the White House? This leads to a very funny rant, but Chieng doesn't really seem to be joking. Who knows what Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger, then Pope Benedict XVI (Anthony Hopkins), and Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the future Pope Francis (Jonathan Pryce), might have said to each other in private meetings six years ago? In this film, the writer Anthony McCarten and the director Fernando Meirelles imagine that the these two very different churchmen -- one a conservative traditionalist, the other considered a more liberal reformer -- had a momentous dialogue that led to the resignation of one man and the ascension of the other. Discussed are issues of sexual abuse and financial malfeasance, and nothing less than the future of the Roman Catholic Church appears to at stake. Even though the movie is pure speculation, the discussion is riveting, and the master actors Hopkins and Pryce create the illusion of actually having it. Rom-coms have long celebrated stalking -- think Lloyd Dobler and his boombox in ""Say Anything."" The dark conceit of the psychosexual thriller ""You"" is that the obsessive protagonist, Joe Goldberg, sees himself as a romantic hero, despite being a serial killer. Following his Season 1 murder spree, Joe now needs a change of scenery. So for Season 2 he relocates to Los Angeles -- a town he hates, providing much fodder for his biting voice-over. The plot this time is largely derived from Caroline Kepnes' novel ""Hidden Bodies,"" the sequel to her ""You."" An unfortunately named woman, Love (played by Victoria Pedretti from ""The Haunting of Hill House""), comes into Joe's orbit as the bodies start dropping again. Could it be that Joe has finally met his soul mate? Or has he just met his match? The ""Austin Powers"" series, ""Malcolm X"" and ""Searching for Sugar Man.""

It's time to hit the road, as Midge Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan) embarks on her first tour, opening for the musician Shy Baldwin on a circuit that takes her from Las Vegas to Florida. Along for the ride, of course, is Midge's manager, Susie Myerson (Alex Borstein), who gets a crash course on contract negotiations. Though a great opportunity for Midge, the tour presents a number of problems, so insecurities are high, nerves are frayed and bad options start to look rather tempting. (It's Vegas, after all.) The show's trademark rat-a-tat repartee only gets better with new banter partners joining the cast: Liza Weil (""Gilmore Girls""), Stephanie Hsu (""The Path"") and Cary Elwes (""Stranger Things"").

Eleven-year-old Jonas Brodsky is both precocious and deaf, and he wants to play Beethoven's Sonata No. 14, a piece the great composer wrote as he was losing his own hearing. In this documentary, Jonas's mom, the filmmaker Irene Taylor Brodsky, combines real footage and animation to tell her son's story, exploring the aural world of a gifted child with cochlear implants. Brodsky's deaf father, Paul, who invented TTY, the first telecommunications device for the deaf, wonders if advances in genetics and technology might mean that ""there will be no deafness in the future."" Brodsky herself suggests that Jonas' musical memory technique turns deafness from a disability into a gift.

The characters in this Tarantino-inflected neo-noir are a new breed of femmes fatales -- less seductive, but more, well, fatal. Although this highly stylized show (there are touches of Lynch and echoes of Hitchcock, too,) is nominally concerned with the activities of the men in the Banished Brawlers gang, the story really revs up when the gang's auxiliary women take charge. Worth extra-close attention is Abigail Spencer's Katherine Harlow, who always seems to be several steps ahead of everybody else. ""All my life, people have been underestimating me,"" she says. She's not complaining -- being underestimated proves to be her secret weapon.

Theater,"Review: In 'Leopoldstadt,' Tom Stoppard Reckons With His Jewish Roots",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/theater/leopoldstadt-review-tom-stoppard.html,"LONDON -- Do you remember? Don't you remember? Can't you remember? Why can't you remember? Variations on those unsettling words -- both explicit and unspoken -- echo through the wrenching final scene of Tom Stoppard's ""Leopoldstadt,"" which opened Wednesday night at Wyndham's Theater in London. They are addressed to a mid-20th century visitor to Vienna, a youngish, defensively British man of slipping poise who appears to have forgotten most of his early childhood. But you could also argue that these questions have been posed, in a sustained murmur, from the very beginning of this richly embroidered portrait of Jewish life in Vienna in the early 20th century. They are questions aimed directly at us, the audience and, by extension, at a wider world conveniently prone to historical amnesia. That would include, above all, the man who wrote this play. A tone of instructional reproach is hardly a quality associated with Stoppard, whose six-decade career embraces a host of exuberantly cerebral plays, from ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"" (1967) to the time-traveling ""Arcadia"" (1993). But ""Leopoldstadt,"" which has been polished to a burnished sheen by the director Patrick Marber, holds a singular position in its author's canon. For starters, Stoppard, 82, has said this will probably be his last play. And, more than anything he has written (including his rueful ""The Real Thing""), ""Leopoldstadt"" feels like an act of personal reckoning for its creator -- with who he is and what he comes from. It's not difficult to see ""Leopoldstadt"" as one man's passionate declaration of identity as a Jew.

Judaism never figured conspicuously in Stoppard's earlier work. For much of his life, he never thought of himself as Jewish. Born Tomas Straussler in a small town in Czechoslovakia in 1937, he grew up largely in Britain, taking the name of Stoppard from the Englishman his mother married after his father's death. As Stoppard writes in program notes for the play, his mother rarely spoke of her own history. It was only when a previously unknown Czech relative made contact with him in the 1990s that he learned about his mother's family, many of whom had died during the Holocaust.

The image of a hand-printed family tree is prominent in ""Leopoldstadt,"" among the black-and-white projections and photographs that hover evanescently between scenes. For the record, it is not Stoppard's family that is portrayed in the play, but a prosperous fictional Austrian clan in Vienna. When the play begins, the family is assembled at the comfortably upholstered apartment occupied by the matriarchal Grandma Emilia Merz (Caroline Gruber) and her son, Hermann (Adrian Scarborough), who runs the family textile business. It is Christmas Day, 1899.

Yes, that holiday is being celebrated in this Jewish household, a commingling of traditions that finds droll expression when a child mistakenly tops the towering Christmas tree with a Star of David. For Hermann -- whose wife, Gretl (Faye Castelow), is Catholic -- cultural assimilation is a fait accompli as Austria moves into a new century. Or is it? The group assembled before us may represent a sort of cosmopolitan melting pot, in which conversation touches on the latest play by Schnitzler, the painting of Klimt (for whom Gretl is posing), higher mathematics and the theories of Freud. (This is a Stoppard play.) But as Hermann speaks of his hopes for future social and professional advancement, you sense insecurity pricking at his complacency (an uneasiness that is subtly and expertly conveyed by Scarborough, in the show's most fully realized portrait). That disquiet assumes dramatic form before the first act ends, when a romantic triangle -- or quadrangle, depending on how you look at it (again, this is a Stoppard play) -- forces anti-Semitic sentiment into the open. In the second act, with scenes set during the Depression that followed World War I and in 1938, on the eve of Austria's incorporation into the Third Reich, that sentiment festers into full-blown, terrifying form. Thus we watch the once-resplendent Merz household become increasingly shabby and bare, as what once felt like a familial fortress is transformed into a defenseless sanctuary. (Richard Hudson's artfully evolving set is lighted in a sepia haze by the masterly Neil Austin, and images of the entire clan, posed as if for posterity, become a heartbreaking motif.) We are introduced to new generations of Merzes (in changing-times costumes by Brigitte Reiffenstuel), whose political allegiances and cultural tastes vary widely. But being Jewish is no longer a choice for them, not in the age of National Socialism. Anyone with even a passing knowledge of European history will know what to expect when the family freezes at the sound of someone pounding on the door. That does not make watching what follows any easier. In the final scene, in 1955, a man we had earlier met as a boy returns to the now abandoned apartment. Played by Luke Thallon, he is a successful writer of comic literature and, as far as he knows, a proper Englishman. It seems safe to say that he is a surrogate for Stoppard.

More than any previous Stoppard play -- including the sprawling ""Coast of Utopia"" trilogy, a 9-hour dive into the Russian Revolution -- ""Leopoldstadt"" is a group portrait, and one of uncommon density. (You will probably feel the need to consult the family tree in the program.) The 40-strong cast is, to a person, very good, and they embody their characters with spiky defining detail. That they threaten to get lost in the play's panoramic sweep is partly the point here. But it is also hard to avoid the impression that they exist as illustrative figures in an admonitory history lesson. There's no denying that lesson's emotional power, nor its frightening relevance in 2020, when anti-Semitic acts and language seem increasingly on the rise. That means that although ""Leopoldstadt"" is set in the past, it is Stoppard's most topical play. It is also his most conventional drama by far. A writer who reliably bent time into pretzels in earlier works, Stoppard hews to a fully linear structure here. And while ""Leopoldstadt"" is replete, to the bursting point, with historical fact and political theory, it is mostly devoid of the intellectual jeux d'esprit that have been its creator's signature. This may be the Stoppard play for people who don't normally cotton to Stoppard. It is as if the playwright felt that what he had to say here was too urgent to be filtered through his usual cerebral playfulness. The unreliability of memory, an abiding Stoppardian concern, is briefly flirted with in the final scene. But ultimately, memory isn't the capricious, fragmenting prism of classic Stoppard. Here, recollection is a laser, a tool to be focused on a past teeming with harsh and essential lessons for the present. It seems fitting that, for once in a Stoppard work, words aren't what leave the most lasting impression. It is instead the vision of people frozen as if for a photograph, beckoning with poignantly immediate life from a distant time before they dissolve into anonymous darkness. ""Leopoldstadt"" demands, with gravity and eloquence, that we never let those visions disappear.","In what he says will probably be his last work, a master playwright finds urgent lessons for the present in the past of a Viennese family.",da8070be-edc1-5d6f-a78c-3962249598cc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/12/arts/leopoldstatd-review1/leopoldstatd-review1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=c8831ab05098bd9921d78c1bcff4a65dcd044efe7f61310de2beb700adefef4b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Adrian Scarborough, left, and Luke Thallon in Tom Stoppard's ""Leopoldstadt"" at Wyndham's Theater in London.",da8070be-edc1-5d6f-a78c-3962249598cc,Demo_data/D1_img2/1da8070be-edc1-5d6f-a78c-3962249598cc.jpg,10
Food,"A Savory, Tender Gnocchi Poised for Success",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/dining/ricotta-gnocchi-dumpling-recipe.html,"Gnocchi, those savory little dumplings, are frequently offered as a first course in Italian restaurants, as an alternative to a pasta course. Other times, a larger portion may make a fine hot lunch, or just a few gnocchi can round out a main course, sidled up to a saucy braised veal shank. The secret to making magnificent tender gnocchi at home is the same as the old joke about how to get to Carnegie Hall: practice, practice, practice.

This is especially true with potato gnocchi; a beginner's attempts usually produce tough, chewy specimens. Overhandled dough and too much added flour may be the culprits, but in truth, there is a learning curve. Expertise is achieved only by repetition, until you acquire the feel for it.

There are, however, many other kinds of traditional Italian gnocchi that don't use potatoes at all. Gnocchi alla romana, for example, is a golden, crisp-topped baked dish made with slices of cooked semolina splashed with cream, butter and cheese. That kind is easier to execute.

And most home cooks can find success making ricotta gnocchi, which, when at their best, can be exceedingly light and delicate (and still pretty darned good even when they're not completely perfect). Essentially, they are made from ricotta and eggs, a touch of Parmesan and a handful of flour. Good, fresh ricotta is critical. Use the very best you can find, typically available at any good Italian deli or well-stocked cheese shops. (The grainy low-fat commercial type doesn't qualify here.) Drain your ricotta well before making the recipe, or the dough will be too wet. Put it in a fine mesh sieve set over a bowl, for several hours or overnight. You will be surprised by how much liquid whey seeps out. I sometimes drink a glass of it (it makes a pleasant beverage and is known to be highly nutritious) or save it to use in soups or smoothies.

When mixing the dough for ricotta gnocchi -- it's really more like a stiff batter -- add the least amount of flour possible. The ethereal custardy ricotta gnocchi served at Zuni Cafe in San Francisco have no flour at all, and the dough must be dropped by the spoonful into simmering water. Those are the lightest ricotta dumplings I know.

But I learned in Italy that adding a small amount ( 1/4  to  1/2  cup) of all-purpose flour to the dough and using fine semolina flour for dusting the work surface makes it possible to roll the dough into long ropes. Use scissors to snip the ropes into gnocchi shapes. I like to let the shaped gnocchi rest on a semolina-dusted baking sheet for an hour before cooking them, but it's fine to skip that step. Ricotta gnocchi are wonderful served in broth or with a light tomato sauce. Another classic preparation has them swimming in butter with sage leaves. But my latest favorite version is to sauce them with a simple parsley pesto, and to finish with a shower of chopped pistachios and Parmesan. These feathery dumplings, with the herbal tang of parsley pesto, call for a penetrating white wine that will cut through their richness but won't be too sharp. The options are many. Fianos from Campania would be delicious, as would good Soaves. If you can find a decent vernaccia di San Gimignano, that would be fine. French wines would be terrific, particularly aligotes from Burgundy and Muscadets from the Atlantic. Vermentinos from Liguria or Corsica would also work well.

Media,Donald Trump Elicits Shock and Biting Satire in European Media,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/29/business/media/donald-trump-elicits-shock-and-biting-satire-in-europe.html,"LONDON -- He has been depicted as a snarling demagogue in France, equated with Donald Duck in Spain, and described as worse than Lord Voldemort in Britain. In Europe, the birthplace of the Enlightenment, Donald Trump has been treated variously as a disturbing curiosity or an entertaining political show barker. His nearly every move and pronouncement has been reported from Paris to Berlin to Helsinki, even as commentators on both left and right have dismissed the notion of President Donald J. Trump as the stuff of fantasy, or, at worst, a momentary lapse of reason. That is changing. With a series of wins in key Republican primary states, and with the billionaire's expected strong showing when 12 states hold primaries or caucuses on Tuesday, the European media, like its American counterpart, is adjusting to the prospect of a seemingly unstoppable Trump juggernaut. The reaction is a mix of befuddlement, outrage and panic, along with admiration in some unlikely quarters. And satire. The Spanish newspaper El Pais recently published an imaginary letter from the grave in which Philip II, a 16th-century Spanish king who ruled a vast empire, offers advice to Mr. Trump. Noting that his nation had also suffered from roguish subjects demanding free handouts, and Muslim terrorists masquerading as peaceful citizens, the king advises Mr. Trump to ""consider bringing back the Inquisition.""

Mr. Trump's often scowling face appears frequently on front pages, his success parsed daily on news bulletins and radio talk shows. Coverage tends to focus on his more outrageous statements rather than much serious examination of how a Trump presidency -- still regarded with horror by many -- might affect international diplomacy. Hillary Clinton's name recognition and star power still fascinate, as does the surprising ascent of her Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders. But Mr. Trump is stealing most of the headlines. Jakob Nielsen, the online editor and former Washington bureau chief of Politiken, an influential Danish newspaper, said that initially editors there did not take Mr. Trump's candidacy seriously, and were disbelieving when the paper's United States correspondents started filing articles saying he might win the Republican nomination. ""As Trump has risen and as he has won the first primaries, the coverage has gone from fascination to outrage,"" he said in a phone interview from Copenhagen. ""There is a sense of shock here after we have seen Trump rallies with almost fascistlike rhetoric."" Reflecting that disbelief, a cartoon in Politiken last week showed a couple on a sofa watching a CNN report asking ""Will Trump make it all the way?"" The incredulous husband tells his wife: ""This is too unreal. Can we watch something more realistic like 'Star Wars'?""

Mr. Trump's toxic irreverence has helped fan the criticism. He drew the ire of the press -- and officials in London and Paris -- after he described neighborhoods in their cities as no-go zones for police. In Britain, his widely reported comments that foreign Muslims should not be allowed to enter the United States provoked such outrage that members of Parliament debated a petition, signed by more than 580,000 people, to ban him from entering the country. (He can still visit.)

A commentary in Bild, a populist German tabloid, recently noted that most Germans could not say who was running in the German state elections in March, but they were following the election campaign in ""distant"" America. For all the provocations by Mr. Trump, his deftness at tapping into the visceral anger of Americans shaken by economic doldrums and globalization has deep resonance in Europe, where citizens from Britain to France to Hungary have also turned to insurgent politicians on the far right or the far left to express disgust with the political mainstream. Jaroslav Plesl, the editor of Mlada fronta Dnes, a leading Czech newspaper, said in an interview that Mr. Trump's willingness to take on the political establishment, even in his own party, had made him a folk hero of sorts in Eastern and Central Europe among people who were disillusioned with the post-1989 political order. Equating Mr. Trump's appeal to that of Ronald Reagan, he argued that the candidate was drawing in fans with his showmanship and swagger. ""The elites in Prague will sneer at him for being dumb and a bad role model, but Czechs in general like underdogs and outsiders like Trump,"" he said. ""To many young people who worship American popular culture, Trump signifies American values like show business, and working hard to achieve success.""

Others in the European news media, however, have expressed shock at Mr. Trump's brand of incendiary politics, in particular the insults he has lobbed at minorities, Muslims, Mexicans, women and the handicapped. Europe has its own brand of immigrant-baiting far-right figures, from Marine Le Pen of the National Front in France to Nigel Farage of the U.K. Independence Party. Mr. Trump enjoys greater popularity in Russia, where the budding bromance between the American and President Vladimir V. Putin has won him praise. The news channel Russia Today, or RT, paid homage to Mr. Trump's talents as a shock jock, and published an interactive article ""on the top ways to be offensive -- Trump-style."" Among the insults highlighted was Mr. Trump's off-color attack on the former Representative Barney Frank, referring to what Mr. Trump called his ""protruding nipples."" ""Love him or hate him, the Republican has an uncanny ability to elicit an explosive response whenever he gets near a keyboard,"" said the broadcaster, which is funded by the Kremlin. Adding to Mr. Trump's fans in Europe, Ms. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, former leader of the National Front, wrote on Twitter on Saturday: ""If I were American, I'd vote Donald Trump ... but God bless him!"" Mr. Le Pen, 87, has been convicted several times of inciting racial hatred. By contrast, the left-leaning French newspaper Liberation expressed puzzlement at Mr. Trump's ascent. Under the headline ""Trump, From Nightmare to Reality,"" it recently noted that there appeared to be nothing to stop Mr. Trump from winning the Republican nomination. ""And this, despite his thundering racist and sexist declarations.""","Once dismissive of Mr. Trump's presidential candidacy, European news media are adjusting to the prospect of a seemingly unstoppable Trump juggernaut.",ed504d2e-939b-5641-b3a8-75175bc7efc3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/29/business/29eutrump-web1/29eutrump-web1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=11de68352e974a4879ccdd5b5545a74e73a7108a75eab1bb45f02836c28d03d8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"On a recent issue of Der Spiegel, the headline says ""Madness: America's Agitator Donald Trump.""",ed504d2e-939b-5641-b3a8-75175bc7efc3,Demo_data/D1_img2/1ed504d2e-939b-5641-b3a8-75175bc7efc3.jpg,16
Technology,"Apple, Google and a Deal That Controls the Internet",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/25/technology/apple-google-search-antitrust.html,"OAKLAND, Calif. -- When Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, the chief executives of Apple and Google, were photographed eating dinner together in 2017 at an upscale Vietnamese restaurant called Tamarine, the picture set off a tabloid-worthy frenzy about the relationship between the two most powerful companies in Silicon Valley. As the two men sipped red wine at a window table inside the restaurant in Palo Alto, their companies were in tense negotiations to renew one of the most lucrative business deals in history: an agreement to feature Google's search engine as the preselected choice on Apple's iPhone and other devices. The updated deal was worth billions of dollars to both companies and cemented their status at the top of the tech industry's pecking order. Now, the partnership is in jeopardy. Last Tuesday, the Justice Department filed a landmark lawsuit against Google -- the U.S. government's biggest antitrust case in two decades -- and homed in on the alliance as a prime example of what prosecutors say are the company's illegal tactics to protect its monopoly and choke off competition in web search.

""We have this sort of strange term in Silicon Valley: co-opetition,"" said Bruce Sewell, Apple's general counsel from 2009 to 2017. ""You have brutal competition, but at the same time, you have necessary cooperation."" Apple and Google are joined at the hip even though Mr. Cook has said internet advertising, Google's bread and butter, engages in ""surveillance"" of consumers and even though Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder, once promised ""thermonuclear war"" on his Silicon Valley neighbor when he learned it was working on a rival to the iPhone. Apple and Google's parent company, Alphabet, worth more than $3 trillion combined, do compete on plenty of fronts, like smartphones, digital maps and laptops. But they also know how to make nice when it suits their interests. And few deals have been nicer to both sides of the table than the iPhone search deal. Nearly half of Google's search traffic now comes from Apple devices, according to the Justice Department, and the prospect of losing the Apple deal has been described as a ""code red"" scenario inside the company. When iPhone users search on Google, they see the search ads that drive Google's business. They can also find their way to other Google products, like YouTube.

A former Google executive, who asked not to be identified because he was not permitted to talk about the deal, said the prospect of losing Apple's traffic was ""terrifying"" to the company. The Justice Department, which is asking for a court injunction preventing Google from entering into deals like the one it made with Apple, argues that the arrangement has unfairly helped make Google, which handles 92 percent of the world's internet searches, the center of consumers' online lives. Online businesses like Yelp and Expedia, as well as companies ranging from noodle shops to news organizations, often complain that Google's search domination enables it to charge advertising fees when people simply look up their names, as well as to steer consumers toward its own products, like Google Maps. Microsoft, which had its own antitrust battle two decades ago, has told British regulators that if it were the default option on iPhones and iPads, it would make more advertising money for every search on its rival search engine, Bing. What's more, competitors like DuckDuckGo, a small search engine that sells itself as a privacy-focused alternative to Google, could never match Google's tab with Apple. Apple now receives an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion in annual payments -- up from $1 billion a year in 2014 -- in exchange for building Google's search engine into its products. It is probably the single biggest payment that Google makes to anyone and accounts for 14 to 21 percent of Apple's annual profits. That's not money Apple would be eager to walk away from. In fact, Mr. Cook and Mr. Pichai met again in 2018 to discuss how they could increase revenue from search. After the meeting, a senior Apple employee wrote to a Google counterpart that ""our vision is that we work as if we are one company,"" according to the Justice Department's complaint. A forced breakup could mean the loss of easy money to Apple. But it would be a more significant threat to Google, which would have no obvious way to replace the lost traffic. It could also push Apple to acquire or build its own search engine. Within Google, people believe that Apple is one of the few companies in the world that could offer a formidable alternative, according to one former executive. Google has also worried that without the agreement, Apple could make it more difficult for iPhone users to get to the Google search engine.

A spokesman for Apple declined to comment on the partnership, while a Google spokesman pointed to a blog post in which the company defended the relationship. Even though its bill with Apple keeps going up, Google has said again and again that it dominates internet search because consumers prefer it, not because it is buying customers. The company argues that the Justice Department is painting an incomplete picture; its partnership with Apple, it says, is no different than Coca-Cola paying a supermarket for prominent shelf space. Other search engines like Microsoft's Bing also have revenue-sharing agreements with Apple to appear as secondary search options on iPhones, Google says in its defense. It adds that Apple allows people to change their default search engine from Google -- though few probably do because people typically don't tinker with such settings and many prefer Google anyway. Apple has rarely, if ever, publicly acknowledged its deal with Google, and according to Bernstein Research, has mentioned its so-called licensing revenue in an earnings call for the first time this year. According to a former senior executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality contracts, Apple's leaders have made the same calculation about Google as much of the general public: The utility of its search engine is worth the cost of its invasive practices. ""Their search engine is the best,"" Mr. Cook said when asked by Axios in late 2018 why he partnered with a company he also implicitly criticized. He added that Apple had also created ways to blunt Google's collection of data, such as a private-browsing mode on Apple's internet browser. The deal is not limited to searches in Apple's Safari browser; it extends to virtually all searches done on Apple devices, including with Apple's virtual assistant, Siri, and on Google's iPhone app and Chrome browser.

In 2005, Apple and Google inked what at the time seemed like a modest deal: Google would be the default search engine on Apple's Safari browser on Mac computers. Quickly, Mr. Cook, then still a deputy to Mr. Jobs, saw the arrangement's lucrative potential, according to another former senior Apple executive who asked not to be named. Google's payments were pure profit, and all Apple had to do was feature a search engine its users already wanted. Apple expanded the deal for its big upcoming product: the iPhone. When Mr. Jobs unveiled the iPhone in 2007, he invited Eric Schmidt, Google's then chief executive, to join him onstage for the first of Apple's many famous iPhone events. ""If we just sort of merged the two companies, we could just call them AppleGoo,"" joked Mr. Schmidt, who was also on Apple's board of directors. With Google search on the iPhone, he added, ""you can actually merge without merging."" Then the relationship soured. Google had quietly been developing a competitor to the iPhone: smartphone software called Android that any phone maker could use. Mr. Jobs was furious. In 2010, Apple sued a phone maker that used Android. ""I'm going to destroy Android,"" Mr. Jobs told his biographer, Walter Isaacson. ""I will spend my last dying breath if I need to.""","In a landmark antitrust complaint, the Justice Department is targeting a secretive partnership that is worth billions of dollars to both companies.",da1996b0-46fc-5d47-b06f-8c0be9deaa95,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/25/business/25applegoogle/merlin_16520613_782fdb1d-b33b-4d7e-8b5c-43c961e3df14-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=7eeeb1e05ded3884ff66f030bf45efa17872d3d6647566bb0942f98bd5426c42&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"In 2007, Steve Jobs, left, Apple's co-founder, invited Google's chief executive, Eric Schmidt, to join him to explain how Google would work on the iPhone.",da1996b0-46fc-5d47-b06f-8c0be9deaa95,Demo_data/D1_img2/1da1996b0-46fc-5d47-b06f-8c0be9deaa95.jpg,20

A planet's magnetic field is generated by the flow of liquid iron deep in its core. While Earth's magnetic field helps shield life here from solar radiation, Mercury is unlikely to be harboring inhabitants that need protection.

Still, the information is useful because it ""is dating processes in the interior of the planet, and it basically tells us something about Mercury's past,"" said Catherine Johnson, a geophysicist at the University of British Columbia and an author of the new study, published in the journal Science.","The spacecraft, which orbited Mercury for four years before crashing into it, found that its magnetic field is almost as old as the planet itself.",2599ad7d-65f6-547b-873e-555c7527fe03,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/12/science/12OBSERVATORY/12OBSERVATORY-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=a9b86b8e93b8c541a6f209f13ded1ac5a3b685211e8ec95e51b1341e3704a9bc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,NASA's Messenger spacecraft found useful information about Mercury's magnetic field before it crashed into the planet.,2599ad7d-65f6-547b-873e-555c7527fe03,Demo_data/D1_img2/12599ad7d-65f6-547b-873e-555c7527fe03.jpg,2
Automobiles,A Truck Tailgate Party: Fire Up the Grilles,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/automobiles/tailgate-party-fire-up-the-grilles.html,"The look of its pickup trucks is so important that General Motors put its best man on the job: the guy who does the Corvettes. Fresh from the task of designing the 2014 Stingray, Tom Peters took on the task of freshening up -- and toughening up -- the Chevrolet Silverado and its fraternal twin, the GMC Sierra. ""A fist in the wind"" is how Mr. Peters describes the pickups' design. The new G.M. trucks are not alone in looking as if they can deliver a punch. The latest full-size pickups from G.M.'s crosstown rivals, Ford and Ram, step into the ring with flattened noses, their huge, blunt grilles often slathered in bright trim. A special edition of the latest Toyota Tundra seems to have as many bars as Milwaukee, capped with a flat, wide nostril. ""There is a trend toward a bigger, bolder look,"" said Mr. Peters, the director of exterior design for Chevrolet trucks, full-size crossovers and performance cars. Automobile grilles have long been carefully created to reflect the image of their brands and a particular model's place in the hierarchy, while truck grilles were comparatively bare and basic. But with trucks locked in ever-fiercer sales battles, their grilles have grown larger and more eye-catching, a modern, motorized riff on the battle shields of medieval crusaders.

After taking a hit when the economy slumped, pickup sales are on the rise again on the strength of a rebounding construction industry: Ram (previously known as Dodge Trucks) gained 49 percent in April from a year earlier, and the full-size truck sales of G.M. and Ford each rose around 24 percent. Manufacturers are scrambling to grab larger shares of this highly profitable market with tougher, more distinctive designs. Rugged exteriors help to hide the fact that many of today's macho-looking trucks are softies on the inside, with interiors wrapped in soft leather, decked with wood trim and buzzing with electronic gadgets. Luxury trucks are especially hot. Ford says that about a third of its pickup sales come from the higher-end versions priced at $35,000 or more. Not long ago, a $50,000 pickup seemed unimaginable. Now the price tags on fancy trucks can rise well above $60,000. In addition, a tough grille can obscure the fact that the power plant behind it is shrinking -- with more fuel-efficient V-6 engines replacing thirsty V-8s in many pickup trucks.

In Texas, where one-sixth of the nation's pickups are sold, and where Mr. Peters showed off his new truck to the press recently, pickups are like the standard uniform of boots and cowboy hats: they are everywhere, but they come in many styles and shapes. Greater personalization, with a variety of available faces, is the latest truck trend. The image of the pickup truck is firmly wrapped in American mythology. Model names read like the listings for John Wayne Week on the Turner Classic Movies channel: High Country, King Ranch, Laramie Longhorn. Manufacturers present trucks primarily as work tools, but despite the ads featuring cowboys, farmers and construction workers, more and more trucks are being used partly -- or mostly -- as family vehicles. ""There's a lot of diversity in the customer range,"" said Joe Dehner, chief exterior designer for Ram and Dodge. In addition to working trucks, he said, ""we also get the 'air haulers,' which means they don't necessarily carry something."" For decades, trucks looked like basic metal boxes. Then Dodge offered up a bold new look for its Ram for the 1994 model year. Under Tom Gale, then the design chief for Chrysler, the pickup added a touch of fantasy to the utilitarian box. With its arched grille and raised hood, the Ram resembled the cab of a mighty 18-wheeler. Today's Ram designers call it ""the big-rig look,"" said Mr. Dehner. ""We own that."" But pickups from other manufacturers began to show the Ram's influence as their designers visually separated the hood and fenders and raised the grille above the headlights.

The perennial best-selling pickup, the Ford F-150, was last redesigned for 2009. But today's F-150 wears many faces: depending on the model or trim level, the grille has multiple small bars or large planks of chrome along with different shapes and colors of meshlike patterns. The Atlas concept truck, unveiled in January at the Detroit auto show, appears to borrow the muscular look of Ford's Super Duty line of larger, more powerful pickups. The Atlas is believed to foreshadow the design of the next-generation F-150, expected next year. The face of the Atlas adds vertical elements to the horizontal bars of the current F-150. The grille's frame forms a shape that suggests the nostrils of a bull. Toyota's new design for its big Tundra truck, first displayed at the Chicago auto show in February, was devised at the Calty design studio in California. The Tundra's grille frame has also been enlarged and its designers, too, use words like bold, chiseled and tough. In one sign of how much truck grilles have grown, the Nissan Titan's, which seemed notably aggressive when the truck made its debut as a 2004 model, looks relatively undersized in comparison with the newer designs of its rivals. Grilles play a critical role in differentiating the many submodels and trim levels of today's trucks. ""It is almost mind-boggling how complex the choices have become,"" Mr. Peters said.

Ford offers a huge choice of variants with its F-150, visually distinguishing a range from base models to King Ranch and Harley-Davidson editions, Special and Platinum luxury versions and the high-performance SVT Raptor, with huge letters molded into a black front end that Ford calls a ""brick wall grille."" Mr. Dehner, the Ram designer, said: ""There has been an explosion of different textures and finishes, not just in the grilles but with colors, wheels and trim packages. People want their vehicle to be customizable. It goes from the country to the urban cowboy and, if you will, the city slicker type. We want to be specific to their needs."" The Ram 1500 comes in nine trim levels and offers four basic types of grille mesh. There is a ""hex-link"" design on the Tradesman, Express and SLT models, with six-sided cells that provide ""the metaphor of the bolt head,"" Mr. Dehner said. The upscale Laramie has a similar ""hex-perf"" grille, in chrome. Then there are two versions of ""billet-perf"" on the Big Horn and Sport. ""It goes with a monochromatic look, big wheels, a hot-rod look,"" he said. The top-of-the-line Laramie Longhorn offers ""wave-mesh"" texture, a diamond wire pattern that dates to sports cars of the 1920s. ""It is an adaptation of the wire mesh grilles on upscale sport utilities,"" Mr. Dehner said. Aerodynamics, surprisingly, may be behind some of the rugged, angular faces of trucks. As boxy as they look, all the trucks are carefully tested in wind tunnels. The fist in the wind must be streamlined: Chevrolet says it has cut aerodynamic drag by 5 percent from the previous Silverado.

Books,Are Ben Marcus's Dark and Disturbing New Stories the Literary Answer to 'Black Mirror'?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/books/review/ben-marcus-notes-from-the-fog.html,"'s new collection of stories takes a dark view of society, as well as of love, sex, marriage, parenting, employment, technology and human interaction of any kind. He's an engrossing, poetically surreal writer. He's often woundingly funny. Still, the pages turn more heavily here than they did in his last two books, ""Leaving the Sea"" (2014) and ""The Flame Alphabet"" (2012) -- which, by the way, were not exactly Disney on Ice.

This is not to say that Marcus is wrong about people, or about the creepy ""Black Mirror"" episode that's become our lives. There's a small, raw moment in the beautifully unnerving opening story, ""Cold Little Bird,"" that distills the book's cautionary howl. A 10-year-old named Jonah has made a chilling announcement to his parents: He no longer loves them or requires their oversight and, if they so much as hug him, he'll report them to the school therapist for unwanted touching. Jonah's father, Martin, is terrified -- both for his boy and himself. Like virtually every couple in the book, he and his wife are post-passion and nearly post-verbal. ""You'll die, without affection,"" Martin tells his son. ""I'm not kidding. You will actually dry up and die."" ""Notes From the Fog"" is about people so alienated that they're not so much living together as standing on adjacent ice floes.

There was a time when the words ""dystopian"" and ""futuristic"" were nearly synonyms, but even the most alarming events in Marcus's genre-roaming book seem no more than five minutes from now. In ""The Grow-Light Blues,"" Carl Hirsch's craven employers choose him to test a product that would replace meals with nutrient-infused rays from a laptop. The admiration and gratitude of his co-workers fade quickly and the light that's ""slowly roasting Carl's face"" transforms him into a monster to be pitied, shunned, fired. In ""Precious Precious,"" a cubicle worker named Ida Grieve is prescribed an insane-sounding antidepressant, called Rally, which is nearly impossible to swallow, then sits undigested in her stomach like a bomb waiting to go off: ""Soon it had risen back into her mouth -- it felt like a small insect crawling up her throat -- and she had to take it out and butter it again."" All the while, Ida is visiting her aging parents as their minds decay. When her mother fears that she's talking gibberish, she takes Ida's hand and -- in another tiny exchange that evokes a larger quest for connection -- says urgently, ""I made sense, didn't I? ... I want to. I so want to. You know that, right?""","""Notes From the Fog"" features the author's trademark humor and a vision of society both devastatingly bleak and seemingly plausible.",e516201b-a702-5a08-96fa-8ae6e1feeafb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/02/books/review/02Giles1/02Giles1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=146708f2b527730a1bf0fbc30c889127a8097294a617b816995b14c9b07d98bf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Ben Marcus,e516201b-a702-5a08-96fa-8ae6e1feeafb,Demo_data/D1_img2/1e516201b-a702-5a08-96fa-8ae6e1feeafb.jpg,13
Books,"For Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Nearly 100, the Beat Goes On",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/books/review/lawrence-ferlinghetti-greatest-poems.html,"Yeah, O.K. -- but what about his writing? The release of ""Ferlinghetti's Greatest Poems"" (I wish New Directions had gone ahead and called it ""Ferlinghetti's Greatest Hits,"" like an album full of ear candy by Tom Petty or Elton John) gives us a chance to revisit that question. It's a complicated one. Do the quicksilver qualities that can make Ferlinghetti's poetry so captivating to an adolescent undermine our ability to take it seriously with the passing of years? In his more unfortunate moments, as in the poem called ""Underwear,"" corny humor lands with a clank and you can't help wincing: ""Underwear can really get you in a bind / Negroes often wear / white underwear / which may lead to trouble.""

It seems self-evident that the passing of years has done ""Underwear"" no favors. At the same time, it would be churlish to deny that Ferlinghetti has given the popular canon many indelible lines. For a while in the 1950s and 1960s, his voice stood out amid a mounting dissident chorus; in these days of hashtagged political resistance, it is not uncommon to come across portions of his stanzas reconstituted as memes on Instagram and Facebook:

Based on passages like that, it's not much of a stretch to put Ferlinghetti in the company of skilled songwriters. He knows how to craft a hook. His lines have an easy, welcoming flow. (In this book, the poems are arranged chronologically and fluidly, as if they were part of an ""Abbey Road""-like symphonic collage or a Hollywood highlight reel.) He has a gift for helping you hear what needs to be said, free of impenetrable filters. He is allergic to willful obscurity and ""our little literary games,"" as he declared in one ""Howl""-referencing populist manifesto that he titled, with characteristic directness, ""Populist Manifesto No. 1"":

Returning to Ferlinghetti is ultimately about returning to the romantic associations of the milieu that produced Ferlinghetti, so it makes sense that some of Ferlinghetti's most plangent stanzas are the ones in which he looks back at the heyday of the Beats, that ""rebel band who / rose over the rooftops of / tenement boneyards / intent on making out / And made out of madness / a hundred years of beatitude."" Maybe there's no way to dissociate Ferlinghetti's poetry from the nostalgic gauze of various North Beach beatnik tropes -- proto-hipsters wearing berets and listening to bebop and smoking French cigarettes, etc. -- but what remains intact in the poems (even as their creator approaches a century of living) is the fresh, youthful energy of that moment. The liberating pulse can still be pretty contagious. His high points are the poems that you wish you could listen to in a car, on a long coastal highway, with the windows rolled down -- and you certainly can't say that about Robert Lowell.

Does the occasionally tossed-off imperfection of the poems give them a kind of time-capsuled charm? If you're willing as a reader to be forgiving, it can be a blast to go back to the way the words bounce. And Ferlinghetti himself can't resist the pull of the past. In ""Plan du Centre de Paris a Vol d'Oiseau,"" this is how he remembers it:","A retrospective collection from the poet and publisher, ""Ferlinghetti's Greatest Poems,"" gets at his rebellious appeal.",2dfd7573-6629-523b-8c0c-7d0b532a17f0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/18/books/review/18Gordinier/18Gordinier-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=0c6f34724075361e65d9bc44de5aa0b5185474f3e6eb416fe4d8a946d86f6f2c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Lawrence Ferlinghetti, left, at a poetry reading.",2dfd7573-6629-523b-8c0c-7d0b532a17f0,Demo_data/D1_img2/12dfd7573-6629-523b-8c0c-7d0b532a17f0.jpg,13
Your Money,Are Markets Efficient? Even the Supreme Court Is Weighing In,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/your-money/are-markets-efficient-even-the-supreme-court-is-weighing-in.html,"A fierce debate about an academic theory loomed over the Nobel in economic science for 2013. Last week, the Supreme Court enshrined that argument in jurisprudence, issuing a ruling that is likely to make it harder for investors to prevail in some big class-action lawsuits. The court's decision emerges from a debate that has been simmering among economists for decades. It flared up again last fall, after the Nobel committee announced that it was giving the 2013 prize to three economists with discordant views on a wonky notion known as the efficient-markets hypothesis. Its core tenet is that market prices embody all available information. That may seem a simple thought, but its implications are controversial, and the court's position has important repercussions. The court delved into this arcane issue during a busy week in which it issued a series of major decisions dealing with cellphone privacy, presidential recess appointments and broadcasters' copyrights in a dispute involving Aereo, the upstart television streaming service. It turned to the efficient-markets hypothesis in a case concerning asbestos liabilities of the oil services company Halliburton. The court rejected a broad challenge to class-action lawsuits contending securities fraud. But it added a major new hurdle for investors that could stop some class-action suits in their tracks by letting corporate defendants try to prove, at an early stage, that there was no connection at all between corporate misstatements and share prices -- and therefore no grounds for litigation.

The court justified this change by updating its notion of market efficiency, basing its interpretation partly on the views of Robert J. Shiller, the Yale economist and a 2013 Nobel laureate. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. echoed Mr. Shiller when he said market prices usually reflect what's known about publicly traded companies -- but not always. In other words, the court said that while market prices contain a great deal of information, they are highly imperfect. The court used that distinction to make an important change in the class-action arena. From now on, companies facing class actions can try to show at an early stage that even if they've made misstatements, market prices were not affected. Until now, the courts had held that the efficient-markets hypothesis meant that such public statements automatically affected market prices, John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia law professor, said in an interview. ""The court ruling could make it easier for companies to get cases dismissed at an early stage,"" he said. ""And it is likely to make it much more expensive for plaintiffs -- for investors -- to file suit."" The argument about efficient markets re-emerged in October, when Mr. Shiller, along with Eugene Fama and Lars Peter Hansen, both of the University of Chicago, won the Nobel. The Nobel committee initially finessed the economists' disagreements by citing their collective contributions to ""empirical analysis of asset prices."" But the divergent opinions among the economists are deep-seated, and Mr. Shiller addressed them last October in an Economic View column in The New York Times; Justice Roberts cited the column in his decision. Mr. Shiller wrote: ""Professor Fama is known as the father of the modern efficient-markets theory, which says financial prices efficiently incorporate all available information and are in that sense perfect. In contrast, I have argued that the theory makes little sense, except in fairly trivial ways.""

Mr. Shiller emphasized ""the enormous role of human error"" that has been documented by behavioral finance and the need to rein in market excesses through regulation. (In an interview, Mr. Fama expressed skepticism about Mr. Shiller's emphasis on the irrational, and said that while he preferred market solutions, regulatory action was often needed.) In court filings and oral arguments, Halliburton said debates like this demonstrated that economists no longer accept the efficient-markets hypothesis as gospel. Therefore, the company argued, the court should overturn a 1988 decision, Basic v. Levinson, that has allowed shareholders in publicly traded companies to form class-action groups based on the automatic assumption that significant misstatements caused share prices to fall. ""The economics have changed,"" Aaron M. Streett, Halliburton's lawyer, declared before the court. He said that many investors ""do not rely on the integrity of the market price whatsoever."" In the Supreme Court's decision, which sends the Halliburton case back to a lower court, Justice Roberts rejected these claims, quoting Mr. Shiller's column. It said: ""Of course, prices reflect available information."" Yet the court also accepted that market prices reflect information imperfectly at best, as Mr. Shiller and others have argued. Sometimes, for example, prices are much higher than can be justified by fundamental factors like corporate earnings and other public information. Sometimes, the court suggested, investors may have disregarded major misstatements by companies' executives. So the court occupied something of a middle ground, much as the Nobel committee did. Investors may continue to rely on the efficient-markets hypothesis in forming class-action groups, and may assume that share prices reflect corporate misstatements. But corporate defendants may now try to prove in specific cases that there was no connection between their statements and price movements. ""It's death by 1,000 cuts,"" Professor Coffee said. ""This isn't in itself a devastating blow to class-action plaintiffs. But it hurts, and it follows a number of other decisions that have limited plaintiffs' ability to sue successfully.""

It could have been much worse for plaintiffs, he observed. A concurring but critical opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas and endorsed by Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Antonin Scalia, came down firmly on Halliburton's side. They said the economic profession's critique of the efficient-markets hypothesis has been so devastating that the precedent set by the Basic v. Levinson case should be overturned entirely. But the court as a whole approached efficient markets much as many long-term investors do. For many practical purposes, it's reasonable to assume that markets are efficient. That's why it's so hard to outperform them, and why so many people use low-cost index funds as their core portfolio holdings. Yet, in another sense, markets aren't efficient at all. They are prone to bouts of irrational exuberance, outright panic and other apparent aberrations that give wise traders an edge, and make claims of total efficiency hard to defend. Are markets efficient? It's all in the details, the court seemed to say. Often they are, but sometimes they're not, and investors need to prepare for the consequences.","In a case that delved into a much-debated academic theory, a ruling erects a new hurdle for investors to clear in some class-action lawsuits.",2811c86a-31be-5200-b3c9-3d40f8421369,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/29/business/29-STRA/29-STRA-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=431&w=600&s=1237f36c9a32bbf5b94027634104fc59dff225ce4ab778cbe21201d340e179ef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"The court's order was brief, provisional and unsigned, but it drew a furious dissent from the three female justices.",2811c86a-31be-5200-b3c9-3d40f8421369,Demo_data/D1_img2/12811c86a-31be-5200-b3c9-3d40f8421369.jpg,21
Art & Design,Amos Rex Museum Is Helsinki's New Homegrown Star,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/arts/design/amos-rex-museum-is-helsinkis-new-homegrown-star.html,"HELSINKI, Finland -- The novelist Meg Wolitzer once wrote that Helsinki is ""a place no one ever thinks about unless they're listening to Sibelius, or lying on the hot, wet slats of a sauna, or eating a bowl of reindeer."" The city leadership here is keen to add something new to that list: fine art. Amos Rex, a new contemporary art museum, goes a long way toward achieving that goal. A museum that appears to physically resist its placement in a vast underground space, it is topped by five conical domes that bubble up from the surface of the Lasipalatsi Square in downtown Helsinki like inverted craters of an alien moonscape. Children clamber up the mounds, teenagers skateboard down its slopes, and passers-by snap selfies.

The $58 million privately funded museum arrives less than two years after Helsinki's City Council rejected a plan to build a $138 million Guggenheim museum along the city's harbor. City officials as well as residents were deeply, often rancorously, divided about the proposal, with supporters asserting that the Guggenheim would raise the city's international profile and serve as an economic game-changer, while opponents said local resources were better spent on cultural institutions that showcased Finnish talent. Finland, after all, has a proud tradition of design exemplified by the architect Alvar Aalto, the designers Timo Sarpaneva and Tapio Wirkkala and, yes, Marimekko. After the five-year controversy dissipated, Mayor Jan Vapaavuori of Helsinki said, everyone took a step back to reconsider the city's cultural priorities.

""What the Guggenheim process led to was a quite serious reflection among all important art players in the city, where they were forced to assess their own place and role in today's world,"" Mayor Vapaavuori said in an interview. ""The positive side of the discussion is that we have a more comprehensive understanding of what culture and art does for the city. It could be that without the Guggenheim discussion we would not be that far along.""

In many ways, Amos Rex vindicates the city's decision to turn down the Guggenheim project, and instead champion a homegrown Finnish institution. The new contemporary art museum is funded by private money, whereas the Guggenheim was designed as a public-private partnership, which some artists feared would sap funding for local arts initiatives. Mr. Kartio, who said he would have welcomed the Guggenheim, notes that planning for Amos Rex was already underway when the Guggenheim project fell apart. However, he added, ""The timing was fortunate for us because of course politically, internally in Finland, we were compared to Guggenheim all the time. Since this was completely privately financed and homegrown, people were very fond of us, especially the people who weren't in favor of the Guggenheim."" The money to build the new museum came from a foundation established by the museum's Finnish founder, Amos Anderson, a newspaper publisher and a patron of the arts, who died in 1961 and earmarked his fortune for the building of the Amos Anderson Art Museum. Four years after he died, the museum opened in his own home in Helsinki with a collection of mostly Finnish and other European art.

Seeking to build a new larger home, Amos Anderson museum and its officials chose the Lasipalatsi, or glass palace, a landmark of Finnish functionalist architecture that houses an entertainment and shopping center with an Art Deco cinema called Bio Rex. Designed by architecture students in 1936 as a temporary site for the Olympics (scheduled to take place in Helsinki in 1940 but postponed until 1952 because of World War II), the Lasipalatsi was supposed to be torn down afterward, but remained, and became a cherished national landmark. The private Amos Rex Foundation formed a real estate company with the city of Helsinki to jointly own the old entertainment complex, and to build a new museum, which it owns independently. The foundation leases the land on which both buildings sit from the city. To build the museum while preserving the existing building, the architects came up with an ingenious idea to excavate the central plaza and create 24,000 square feet of exhibition space. Below the exhibition halls, two stories down, are archive and storage rooms. Amos Rex, which derives its name from the museum's founder and the cinema, has helped create a kind of ""museum mile"" that joins up with the three of the city's nearby art institutions -- Kiasma Contemporary Art Museum, the Helsinki Art Museum and Kunsthalle Helsinki. ""It's one big cluster, and we bind it together in a way, and we all support each other,"" Mr. Kartio said.

The results of Helsinki's post-Guggenheim rethink are manifest throughout the city: A few blocks away from the new museum, the Helsinki Central Library Oodi is under construction and expected to open in December. The Helsinki Art Museum is organizing an International Helsinki Art Biennial to open in 2020 and two weeks ago, the city announced its intention to build a world-class architecture and design museum in the harborside space that the Guggenheim might have occupied. ""A lot of exciting things are happening right now in Helsinki,"" said Raija Koli, director of Frame Contemporary Art of Finland, which provides grants to Finnish artists and coordinates Finland's participation in the Venice Biennale. ""We're regrouping and I think in a good way. There's a lot of good will from everyone to kind of bring their resources together and that's why it's such a great time to be working with art and culture here right now.""",A new contemporary art museum vindicates the Finnish capital's decision to turn down a proposal to build a Guggenheim branch there.,5150d5c3-2c60-5ba4-b6f9-eb061cc8ac6d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/08/arts/08amosrex1/08amosrex1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=bf070a03912601c84708b90fc6483d9c785ff161b1c147a1103f3ec5709d0746&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Visitors outside Amos Rex, an underground museum topped by conical domes that bubble up from the surface of the Lasipalatsi Square in downtown Helsinki.",5150d5c3-2c60-5ba4-b6f9-eb061cc8ac6d,Demo_data/D1_img2/15150d5c3-2c60-5ba4-b6f9-eb061cc8ac6d.jpg,14
Theater,"Stars Bring a Broadway Tune Back to Times Square, Unexpectedly",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/theater/surprise-theater-times-square.html,"Broadway performers sing their hearts out under face shields Wednesday at a pop-up event on the TKTS stairs in Times Square.





The first notes of the unexpected chorus sounded just after 3:30 p.m. in Times Square, rising above the noise of passing traffic and halting some passers-by in their tracks. More than two dozen actors and actresses -- including Andrew Rannells, Carolee Carmello, Jason Gotay, Telly Leung, Norm Lewis and Andrea Burns -- assembled Wednesday afternoon on the tall red staircase that rises above a theater ticket booth. After a few breaths, they launched into the song ""Sunday"" from Stephen Sondheim's musical ""Sunday in the Park With George.""

The unadvertised event, directed by the Pulitzer- and Tony-Award-winning composer Tom Kitt and the Tony honoree Michael McElroy, was set up by a volunteer organization, NYCNext, which has sought to counter the effects of the coronavirus pandemic by producing what it calls public ""moments of joy."" James Sampliner and the Tony and Emmy winner Billy Porter provided the song arrangement, along with McElroy. Standing among the ensemble on the staircase was Bernadette Peters, who played Dot, one of the main characters in ""Sunday in the Park,"" which debuted on Broadway in 1984.

Peters said before the performance that she hoped the song ""Sunday,"" which in the musical helps to create calm during a fractious moment, could do the same in real life. ""We can't move around, we can't gather, we can't go to the theater,"" she said. ""We need something that can be a healing balm.""

The performance comes at a precarious time for the theater. Broadway and Off Broadway houses have been closed since March, and although a few shows have announced opening dates in March 2021 -- a major one, ""The Music Man,"" is aiming for May -- the future is uncertain.

NYCNext was started in August by Andy Lerner, who has led tech start-ups, and Maryam Banikarim and Caroline Donahue, both of whom have worked as marketing executives. It aims to support the city's cultural community by showcasing performers at a time when venues are closed and providing the participants with stipends. The effort was born of impatience with the notion that New York City would not be able to recover from the pandemic, said Banikarim, adding: ""We believe the best way to revitalize our city is through the arts."" Its first event took place in Chelsea on Sept. 25 when the Grammy-nominated pianist and composer Elio Villafranca and his band performed on the sidewalk of West 21st Street near Ninth Avenue. On Tuesday a poet named Mahogany Browne recited works in Central Park. Future events are expected to include performances by jazz musicians, comedians and dancers. To avoid drawing a crowd that might make social distancing difficult, NYCNext does not publicly promote these events. The fact that performances are not announced adds a serendipitous element of discovery to the moment, Lerner said, adding: ""You just stumble into something amazing that only happens in New York.""","Two dozen shielded performers, including Bernadette Peters and Andrew Rannells, surprised passers-by with a rendition of Stephen Sondheim's ""Sunday.""",b596449a-9044-50f1-8de2-178bfed563ad,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/07/arts/07bway-item-7/merlin_178198113_01bb3373-a71d-4234-8069-3739b69dc515-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=3cd85e2c54c8c0418834e8604494ea8b6f361f926ccb9895423e8f55cb8d69ef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Bernadette Peters attends Broadway Next Event on the TKTS stairs in Times Square on October 7th, 2020.",b596449a-9044-50f1-8de2-178bfed563ad,Demo_data/D1_img2/1b596449a-9044-50f1-8de2-178bfed563ad.jpg,10
Fashion & Style,Movie Star Dane DeHaan: He Broods. He Pouts. He ... Golfs?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/13/fashion/mens-style/dane-dehaan-actor-leading-man-valerian-golf.html,"Credit...Ryan Pfluger for The New York Times; Styled by Alex Tudela



Dane DeHaan has watery, nearly translucent blue eyes -- somewhere between mysterious and radioactive, ""made for cinema,"" according to the director Derek Cianfrance -- and a haunted stare that has made him Hollywood's go-to avatar of teenage torment. In the few years he has been acting on film, he has played a high-school loner turned telekinetic terrorist (""Chronicle""), the troubled son of an absent father (in Mr. Cianfrance's ""The Place Beyond the Pines""), and a tortured analysand (""In Treatment""). So when a reporter asked Mr. DeHaan what they might spend an afternoon doing together, the answer came as a surprise. ""I always say if I could do anything, I would be a professional golfer,"" said Mr. DeHaan, whose handicap is a country-club respectable 12, on a windy December morning at the driving range at Chelsea Piers in New York. ""But I'm not good enough, so I'm an actor."" He reared back and drove into a golf ball with a satisfying thwack, and it sailed out toward the Hudson River. Finding one of American film's favorite young interpreters of subcutaneous roil on the links (or the range, barring that) was not what I expected, I told Mr. DeHaan. ""No one expects me to golf,"" he said. ""I don't think there are so many moody, brooding people on golf courses. But I always say that golfing and acting are very similar to me. I think they're both singular practices. It's something that no matter how hard I work at, or practice, I will never be as good as I want to be."" (There's that roil.)

Actually, Mr. DeHaan contests the descriptions, now standard, of him as a tortured-artist type (though he did recently play James Dean in ""Life,"" a Dean biopic). He has played happy-go-lucky (in John Hillcoat's 2012 bootlegging period piece ""Lawless"") and straight man to a marauding zombie girlfriend (""Life After Beth""). But it is Mr. DeHaan's brittle soulfulness that has booked him four Prada ad campaigns and kept him on lists of soon-to-break-out stars. That break has been primed by independent films like ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" and the studio-system imprimatur of a key role as the Green Goblin in ""The Amazing Spiderman 2."" In 2017, he is headlining, for the first time in his career, two major films. ""A Cure for Wellness,"" a creepy thriller from Gore Verbinski, the director of ""The Ring"" and the first three ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films, comes out next month, with Mr. DeHaan in nearly every frame. And Luc Besson's ""Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,"" a reportedly $180 million sci-fi spectacular -- the most expensive film ever made in Europe, according to Variety -- follows in July, with hopes of expanding into a franchise. In that one, Mr. DeHaan is not the surly teenager or the supporting villain: He is, for the first time, the hero, Valerian himself -- with a supermodel consort, no less: Cara Delevingne.

""I feel like Hollywood can really take people, take a hold of them and make them feel pressure that doesn't need to be there,"" he said. ""I don't want Hollywood to influence me, I want to influence Hollywood."" He now shuttles there a week or two a year for meetings. (He also admits he takes himself too seriously ""almost all the time."") ""I think a lot of people put that pressure on themselves,"" he said, gazing out over the driving range. ""I think people feel like this is their moment and they have to capitalize on it, or whatever. I want to do this forever. So I'm more than happy to just kind of let things happen."" It helps that he has not been without an acting job since graduating from the University of North Carolina School of the Arts in 2008. He had been so eager to act that he finished high school there as well, as part of its high school program. ""I never waited tables out of school,"" he said. ""I waited tables summers between college in anticipation of waiting tables."" His return to the restaurant never arrived. He followed a well-worn path -- the ""Law & Order"" guest appearance, Off Broadway theater, recurring roles on HBO -- before crossing over onto the big screen. Luckily, he added, even if doing ""The Aliens,"" a three-man play by the Pulitzer winner Annie Baker, which he performed in a 104-seat theater and for which he won an Obie Award, was ""one of the best experiences of my career."" ""Still,"" he added, ""when I was doing Off Broadway plays, I would have been making more money collecting unemployment."" Mr. DeHaan looks younger than his 30 years, and his delicate, almost alien handsomeness makes him an unusual fit for a Hollywood megastar. He had to adopt a ""bro lifestyle"" to bulk up for ""Valerian."" But he has always found support among directors, including Steven Spielberg, who cast him in a small part in ""Lincoln,"" and Mr. Cianfrance.

At the time of his casting in that film, Mr. DeHaan was not well known; Mr. Cianfrance had not seen any of his other films. ""There was discussion of other more established actors for that role, and actors that would have secured financing in an easier way in that time,"" he said. ""But across the board, he was undeniable."" Mr. DeHaan has an intensity that holds the screen, whether he is uncovering the sinister truth about a Swiss spa in ""A Cure for Wellness"" (""We want to do what 'Jaws' did to a day at the beach to the health spa,"" Mr. Verbinski said) or battling aliens as a time-traveling special agent in ""Valerian."" ""With Dane, 30 seconds after I sat down at the bar with him, the restaurant, I knew that it was him, for sure,"" said Mr. Besson, the director of ""Valerian."" ""After one minute, my problem is, if he says no, I'm in trouble. It was already printed in my head."" ""Valerian"" is a different kind of film, and a different kind of acting, for Mr. DeHaan, who is classically trained and speaks reverently of ""doing"" rather than ""acting."" (On the inside of his forearm, ""i do."" is tattooed in tiny letters, as a reminder.) ""Valerian"" was shot largely in front of a blue screen, for the visual effects to be added in later. And yet, Mr. Besson said, ""you can see what he's seeing. He's watching the alien or the spaceship. You have no doubt about it.""","After years of supporting work and high-profile Prada campaigns, an actor known for his translucent eyes and angsty roles headlines two major films.",7b321a2f-658c-5406-b4a3-0af1eaff9e44,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/13/fashion/13COVER/13COVER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=cbbd562323daaa78b5719d67930131f4f66787caf8e839357bb216bd42d1f33c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dane DeHaan has become Hollywood's go-to avatar of teenage torment.

Media,"Young Sheldon, Meet SpongeBob: CBS and Viacom Are Back Together",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/business/media/viacom-cbs-merger.html,"After more than a decade apart, CBS and Viacom are reuniting. In a deal that closed on Wednesday, the CBS Corporation, the company behind the broadcast network CBS and the publisher Simon & Schuster, merged with Viacom, the owner of Paramount Pictures and the cable outlets MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. The combination brings together a set of businesses that once dominated the media and entertainment industries but are now fighting to stay relevant in an increasingly digital world. CBS and Viacom were already corporate siblings before the deal, both controlled by National Amusements, a theater company that grew into a major conglomerate under the mogul Sumner M. Redstone, who is ailing at age 96. His daughter, Shari Redstone, emerged as the company's leader in recent years and had sought a merger since 2016. With the deal, Ms. Redstone cements her role as a trailblazing figure in a male-dominated industry, a woman whose peers now include leaders of media behemoths like Brian Roberts of Comcast and Robert A. Iger of the Walt Disney Company. Now that Disney has joined Netflix and Amazon as a force in the streaming industry, the merger is meant to make ViacomCBS, as the new company will be called, a bigger player in digital entertainment than the two companies had been as separate entities. Unlike its streaming rivals -- a group that includes Apple, with its new Apple TV Plus streaming service, and AT&T, the owner of HBO Max, scheduled to make its debut in May -- ViacomCBS will focus on supplying films and television series to other companies. With an executive team led by Ms. Redstone, the chairwoman of the company's board, ViacomCBS intends to follow a strategy of selling its wares to the highest bidder as demand for original content increases.

The number of streaming subscribers around the world surpassed the number of cable subscribers for the first time last year, and Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and other platforms are fighting to attract customers who have cut the cord or are one cable technician visit away from doing so. That has set off a frenzy of activity among the streaming companies, and ViacomCBS has already started to take advantage of the new demand. Paramount's TV arm, for example, created ""Jack Ryan,"" a popular series on Amazon Prime Video, and CBS has produced content, like the true-crime drama ""Unbelievable"" and the comedic thriller ""Dead to Me,"" that streams exclusively on Netflix. In October, Viacom sold streaming rights to the animated comedy series ""South Park"" to AT&T's HBO Max in a deal worth $500 million.

ViacomCBS also has a small toehold in streaming services with CBS All Access and Showtime, which together have more than eight million subscribers and feature originals such as the reboot of ""Twilight Zone"" and ""Star Trek: Picard,"" which is scheduled to have a January debut. Viacom's free, ad-supported streaming service, Pluto, has more than 20 million viewers a month. From 2000, when National Amusements acquired CBS, until 2006, the two companies were a single entity. Mr. Redstone split them apart when the Viacom properties were growing faster than the CBS broadcast network and radio stations. A reunification was seen as necessary now that television audiences have eroded and the movie business is adjusting to streaming. The creation of ViacomCBS is a victory for Ms. Redstone, whose efforts to bring about a merger drew opposition from the CBS Corporation board, including its former chief executive Leslie Moonves. Mr. Moonves was pushed out last year after several women accused him of sexual misconduct, charges he has denied. Some analysts have questioned the deal, saying it may not be enough to fend off the decline in traditional television. Michael Nathanson, an analyst with the Wall Street research firm MoffettNathanson, said ViacomCBS would have to ""explain how the combination helps better insulate it"" from the current pressures on the cable and satellite business.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The merger seems to be largely a ""defense play,"" he said. ""For the stock to work, they have to prove that their current strategy is either building long-term asset value or generating more attractive"" returns, he said. ""If they can't, we remain in purgatory."" Shares of both CBS and Viacom have dropped about 20 percent since the merger was announced in August.

David Nevins, the head of Showtime, has been put in charge of overseeing collaborative efforts between programmers across both CBS and Viacom, reporting to both Mr. Bakish and Mr. Ianniello. Mr. Nevins is directly in charge of programming for CBS, Showtime and BET. He has also developed a close working relationship with Ms. Redstone. This is the first season in decades that CBS programming has come from someone other than Mr. Moonves, who was often credited with the network's ratings dominance over the past decade. For this season so far, CBS has lost the crown to NBC, with ratings falling more than 12 percent from last year. The 2019-20 television season could ultimately shake out differently. On a conference call with analysts last month, Mr. Ianniello predicted that CBS would finish the season in May ""as America's most-watched network."" The deal is the last in the current wave of media megamergers. Two major transactions totaling more than $150 billion closed just last year. AT&T buttoned up its $80 billion acquisition of Time Warner. Shortly thereafter, the Walt Disney Company beat out its rival Comcast to win the majority of Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox business for $71.3 billion. But the combination of CBS and Viacom amounts to a fraction of those deals, underscoring the need for such a merger. The equity value of the new business is about $25 billion, putting it far behind rivals like Disney, which also has a theme parks business, and NBCUniversal, which is owned by the cable giant Comcast. Several key advisers to Ms. Redstone have suggested a bigger deal could come in the future, with ViacomCBS selling to a tech giant, four people familiar with those discussions have said. Even so, Ms. Redstone is not in a rush to sell off a business she has just spent years pulling together, they added. When asked if ViacomCBS was large enough to compete against its supersize competitors, Ms. Redstone said it would be a mistake to confuse a company's value with its heft.","Shari Redstone gets her wish, bringing about the merger of two media giants in a $25 billion deal.

Sports,"Relocated From a Park to a Football Stadium, the Miami Open Emphasizes Luxury",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/sports/tennis/miami-open-hard-rock-stadium.html,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- Stephen M. Ross swears he is not embroiled in a third-set tiebreaker with Larry Ellison, the billionaire co-founder of Oracle who bought the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., a decade ago and transformed it into a tony desert party for tennis players and fans. Still, when the moved and improved Miami Open begins this week at Hard Rock Stadium, home of Ross's Miami Dolphins, it will not be hard to imagine Ross, a billionaire real estate developer, keeping a tiny scorecard in his back pocket. ""Larry's done a great job,"" Ross said. ""He set the bar high, and it's all great for tennis. But for us, it's more natural not to compete, or at least to do so in our own way."" Ross, who bought the Dolphins in 2008 and spent $550 million renovating the stadium, stepped in when IMG, which owns the Miami Open, found itself at an impasse with a Key Biscayne resident who controlled the land where the tournament had been played since 1987.

That man, Bruce Matheson, refused to allow $50 million worth of renovations to the Crandon Park site, and his prolonged lawsuits convinced the tournament that it was time to go. Rather than see the tournament -- and its hundreds of millions in local revenue -- uprooted from South Florida to Orlando or China, Ross decided to partner with IMG and move the tournament about 20 miles northwest to his football stadium. He spent an additional $72 million to transform it into a state-of-the-art tennis venue. The move wasn't well received by everyone. ""Key Biscayne had a very intimate setting, and you can't beat the drive over the Rickenbacker Causeway, with blue water on both sides of you,"" said John Isner, the defending Miami Open champion. ""We had a lot of history in that place, and that stadium court will always be very special to me."" At the new site, a temporary main court was erected on the football field, with half of the seats were blocked off by screens. A 5,191-seat grandstand court, two other show courts and eight additional match courts -- all permanent -- were built on top of parking lots. On a recent tour, those lots were indiscernible behind purple flowers, artificial grass, 35-foot mature palm trees costing $35,000 a pop, and a giant fountain that guards one of the many entrances to the stadium. There is also a 40-by-90-foot video screen, the largest in tennis, just outside the stadium in a spot modeled after Wimbledon's Henman Hill, minus the grass.

The change recalls the United States Open's move from the charming but outgrown West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills in 1978 to the more functional, if less romantic, U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in nearby Flushing Meadows. It took a while to get used to the new digs, but no one would ever want to go back to the old ones.

""This place has a much larger footprint, so we can do more things,"" said Tom Garfinkel, the Dolphins' chief executive. ""We are giving people an unprecedented luxury experience in tennis, just like the N.F.L."" Tournament organizers did not take the word ""luxury"" lightly. The stadium court -- painted in colors called Oasis Blue and Biscayne Blue -- seats 13,800, the same as the main court in Key Biscayne. But this court features 4,738 premium seats, many that resemble Barcaloungers, with individual television screens. These seats range in price from $50,000 to $70,000 for the two-week tournament. Some are right on the court. Premium-seat packages, most of which were sold out two months before the start of the tournament, include private dining rooms. Some suites have seats made out of Ferrari leather. For a privileged 1,000 visitors, there is a dedicated entrance from a private parking lot, in which spectators pass through a tent lined with art, including works by Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol that can be purchased for upward of $1 million. Ticket prices at every level have increased by up to 40 percent over last year, though several thousand grounds passes are available for as little as $15 each day. Sales by the end of last month were up 25 percent, thanks, in part, to Dolphins season-ticket holders who have been cajoled into watching tennis. ""There's a bit of a challenge in giving people the confidence that this really is for the best,"" said James Blake, the tournament director.

Ross helped choose everything on the site: the flowers, the gigantic paintings that line the stadium corridors, the tiles on the bathroom walls. ""I had a picture in my head of what I wanted this to look like, the same way I do my real estate deals,"" said Ross, who is also behind Manhattan's Hudson Yards project. ""It's all in the details. Little things matter. People notice, and they're watching for those details."" The number of practice courts, many with spectator seating, have doubled from those at Key Biscayne, to 18. But unlike in Key Biscayne, those courts will not be turned over for the public to play on after the tournament ends.

 The players, at least, should be happy. Their amenities have been enhanced, with dining areas and gym spaces tripling in size. The top eight seeds in the men's and women's singles draws, as well as all former champions, will be given private suites to be used by their entourages. But organizers see the event as more than a tennis tournament. The grounds will open at least two hours before play begins each day to encourage people to come early to eat, shop and listen to concerts by local musicians. ""What we wanted was a venue that would allow us the freedom and flexibility to grow and innovate the event,"" said Mark Shapiro, president of Endeavor, IMG's parent company. ""Key Biscayne was lovely, but we simply outgrew it. What we've got now is going to be supernatural, like walking through a Lollapalooza, and a tennis tournament grew out of it. Forget becoming the fifth major, we're the new U.S. Open.""","The moved and improved Miami Open, a top men's and women's tennis tournament, begins this week at Hard Rock Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins.",79b6234a-2638-5d95-974b-0ab5321833df,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/18/sports/18miamiopenweb1/18miamiopenweb1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=3473d9f35599d9c324442a510aa1b169d0b3c129b20c580e72e3b5b51f8b1ad1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Miami Open, which begins this week, has moved from a Key Biscayne park to Hard Rock Stadium, home of the Dolphins.",79b6234a-2638-5d95-974b-0ab5321833df,Demo_data/D1_img2/179b6234a-2638-5d95-974b-0ab5321833df.jpg,9

Health,College Rape Prevention Program Proves a Rare Success,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/health/college-rape-prevention-program-proves-a-rare-success.html,"A program that trained first-year female college students to avoid rape substantially lowered their risk of being sexually assaulted, a rare success against a problem that has been resistant to many prevention efforts, researchers reported Wednesday. Sexual violence is a serious hazard on college campuses. By some estimates, one in five female students are raped, and women tend to be at the greatest risk during their first year on campus. In the aftermath of several highly publicized campus rapes, the White House last spring issued guidelines directing colleges to address sexual assault. In a randomized trial, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, first-year students at three Canadian campuses attended sessions on assessing risk, learning self-defense and defining personal sexual boundaries. The students were surveyed a year after they completed the intervention. The risk of rape for 451 women randomly assigned to the program was about 5 percent, compared with nearly 10 percent among 442 women in a control group who were given brochures and a brief information session.

""Only 22 women would need to take the program in order to prevent one additional rape from occurring within one year,"" the authors concluded. The risk of attempted rape was even lower -- 3.4 percent among women who received the training, compared with 9.3 percent among those who did not. ""It's an important, rigorous study that shows that resistance and self-defense training needs to be part of college sexual assault prevention,"" said Sarah E. Ullman, a professor of criminology, law and justice at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who was not involved in the research. ""This won't solve the problem, but it's an important piece that has been overlooked."" Other researchers praised the trial as one of the largest and most promising efforts in a field pocked by equivocal or dismal results. But some took issue with the philosophy underlying the program's focus: training women who could potentially be victims, rather than dealing with the behavior and attitudes of men who could potentially be perpetrators. Such a strategy could reduce risk for some victims, said Sarah DeGue, a behavioral scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who reviewed evaluations of prevention programs for the White House Task Force on campus sexual assault.

But, she added, ""It's possible that potential perpetrators could encounter individuals who have received training and just move on to more vulnerable individuals."" To address sexual assault comprehensively, she and other experts said, colleges as well as high schools and middle schools should take multifaceted approaches that considered root causes of violence against women and men, compelled bystanders to intervene and gave guidance on healthy relationships. Charlene Y. Senn, the lead author of the Canadian study and a social psychologist at the University of Windsor, did not disagree. ""It gives women the knowledge and skills they need right now, but the long-term solution is to reduce their need to defend themselves,"" said Dr. Senn, who also supervises a campus bystander program. The two-year trial at universities in Calgary, Alberta, and Windsor and Guelph in Ontario, expanded on components of other resistance programs and added a training session on sexuality and relationships. Students, largely recruited in psychology classes, could take all four three-hour sessions over a weekend or in weekly classes. The structure was purposely dynamic, and included role-playing, discussion and problem-solving. One major hurdle, Dr. Senn said, was that the young women had been taught just to be on guard against the stranger rapist -- to fear the shadowy campus at night, the deserted parking lots. Rape by an acquaintance or a romantic partner, far more common, is not a concept they had considered, she said. At a session Lindsey Boyes attended at the University of Calgary, she said she was startled to learn that if someone had sex with a person who was intoxicated, the act could be defined as sexual assault: A person who is mentally incapacitated because of alcohol or drugs cannot legally give consent.

""I felt an adrenaline rush and some shock,"" Ms. Boyes, 22, said. ""It was eye-opening to realize that I had been raped in high school."" At 16, she had been at a party, drinking alcohol for the first time, and was very drunk. A boy offered to take her home -- and then assaulted her. She was devastated, for years thinking of herself as ""damaged goods."" But the resistance program brought some relief, she said. ""I no longer felt shame and guilt about it being my fault,"" Ms. Boyes said. During the program, students learn strategies to protect themselves at social gatherings, such as buddy systems. Ms. Boyes said that now when she went to bars, she covered her glass to protect against date-rape drugs. The Canadian program was also effective for women who, like Ms. Boyes, had been victimized before they went to college. A study about sexual assaults of first-year college women, published this month in The Journal of Adolescent Health, noted that women who had been previously assaulted may be up to six times more likely to be revictimized during that first year than women who had never faced sexual violence. The acquaintance rape theme was continued in the self-defense session. Women may be better prepared psychologically to be physically aggressive against a stranger, Dr. Senn said, ""but if the attacker is your friend's boyfriend, you're not going to push your keys against his eyes.""","The program focused on first-year students at three Canadian campuses who attended sessions on assessing risk, learning self-defense and defining personal sexual boundaries.",d421cae9-618c-52f3-b651-843cd91bb10f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/11/science/11ASSAULT/11ASSAULT-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=725b21ac0e1520ec866c8ed44fe37da3ddfc4c6a47873839225eff2c1361aa5e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Lindsey Boyes, a student at the University of Calgary, attended a college sexual assault prevention program that helped her feel less shame about being assaulted in high school.",d421cae9-618c-52f3-b651-843cd91bb10f,Demo_data/D1_img2/1d421cae9-618c-52f3-b651-843cd91bb10f.jpg,1
Real Estate,"House Hunting in Nicaragua: A Solar-Powered Ranch for $650,000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/realestate/house-hunting-in-nicaragua-a-solar-powered-ranch-for-650000.html,"This eco-friendly equestrian estate is set on about nine acres outside the popular coastal town of San Juan del Sur, in southwestern Nicaragua. Built in 2009 using salvaged roof tiles and doors, locally sourced wood and other antique or handcrafted materials, the colonial-style property includes nine total bedrooms, stables for up to 18 horses and a swimming pool, and is powered entirely by solar energy (with grid backup). The estate, named Rancho Chilamate for a chilamate tree growing on the grounds, is anchored by a 3,800-square-foot, four-bedroom main house. An adjacent house has a garage and two staff bedrooms, and a stand-alone casita has one bedroom. Two additional staff bedrooms are near the stables.

""Particularly now,"" he said, ""I can certainly think of worse places to be self-isolating,"" adding that the price was recently reduced from $729,000. Heather van Doorninck, the seller, said she wanted to honor Nicaragua's architectural heritage when she built the estate. ""All the cement is by hand,"" she said. ""Every single rock here is cut in the forest with a chain saw. Nothing is milled here. It's authentically grounded and gorgeous."" Ms. van Doorninck has rented rooms for $200 a night and led guests on horseback tours to the beach or through a riverside jungle inhabited by howler monkeys. ""The cacophony of jungle noises here is amazing,"" she said. A long driveway leads to a parking area and a white security wall surrounding much of the property. Through the gate are a stone courtyard with a barbecue and an outdoor dining area. Two faded blue antique doors open into the home's great room, with 20-foot vaulted ceilings and tropical hardwood beams. The space includes a dining table for 10, a TV area and the kitchen.

Past the kitchen, saloon doors lead to a hallway with a half bathroom, a pantry storage area and a tack room. To the right are three bedrooms with en suite bathrooms, including the master suite, all of which open out to the pool terrace through French doors. A fourth bedroom and a bathroom with an outdoor shower are across a courtyard off the great room. The 10-by-20-foot pool and surrounding flagstone deck have a variety of areas for sitting and dining, including a built-in nook with a Moroccan-style daybed, hammocks and a covered outdoor living room. Each of the home's two towers disguises a water tower. A separate 700-square foot, one-bedroom, one-bath casita with a kitchen and terrace is about 200 feet away, nestled under shade trees.

Besides the stables, the facilities include a round training pen, a barn, paddocks and a forge. The property is being sold turnkey -- with option to be operated as a bed-and-breakfast -- and the horses can be purchased separately. The estate, located just outside the village of Escamequita, is 10 miles south of San Juan del Sur, a former fishing village that reinvented itself as a hub for surfing and tourism in the late 20th century. The Pacific Ocean is about 45 minutes away by horse and 10 minutes by car. Augusto Cesar Sandino International Airport, in Managua, Nicaragua's capital, is about 100 miles north, and Daniel Oduber Quiros International Airport in Costa Rica is 90 miles south. Nicaragua remains one of Latin America's poorest countries, though its economy saw encouraging gains in the years after the global recession as the country became more popular with tourists and second-home buyers, especially as an alternative to pricier Costa Rica.

In 2017, the nation's real estate market was poised to ""boom,"" Mr. Cooper said: ""At that time, it was one of the fastest growing tourism destinations out there, in terms of the numbers of arrivals."" That changed in the spring of 2018, when Nicaragua's government clashed with protesters, prompting the U.S. State Department to issue a travel advisory ""due to civil unrest, crime, limited health care availability, and arbitrary enforcement of laws."" The turmoil took its toll on the housing market. Along the country's southwest coast, which includes San Juan del Sur and the Emerald Coast, sales prices dropped an average of 30 percent, and in some cases as much as 50 percent, said Julio Cesar Lacayo, a founder of Aurora Beachfront Realty, based in San Juan del Sur. Since 2018, Mr. Lacayo said, his company has shifted more to rentals as sales in Managua have remained scarce -- a situation exacerbated by the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.

Jesse ""Pedro"" Resau, the owner and broker of RE/MAX Coastal Properties, a Nicaraguan agency, said the market in San Juan del Sur had begun to pick up in mid-2019 and into 2020. In March and April, the pandemic all but stamped out his business. Two-bedroom houses selling for around $300,000 before the turmoil of 2018 are now selling for 25 percent less. At a higher price tier, homes that sold for $500,000 to $700,000 in early 2018 are now going for $300,000 to $400,000. At the luxury end, homes that had been listed for between $900,000 and $1.2 million in early 2018 were selling for between $500,000 to $700,000 in mid-2019, but the luxury market is currently stagnant, Mr. Resau said. ""There has been no movement in luxury homes here, not in the San Juan del Sur area, since last year,"" he said. But his business has begun picking up again. A few properties that offered video tours and price cuts are in contract, and that prospective buyers have made offers from abroad on homes they toured during earlier visits. Agents said there are discounts to be found, though many sellers haven't lowered asking prices on homes, even as land prices have fallen. ""They're basically trying to see how this pandemic is going to shake out before they make a determination of what they're going to do with their properties here,"" Mr. Resau said. Despite the ""double blow of the period of the crisis followed by this outbreak,"" Mr. Cooper said, ""interest was looking very rosy again at the beginning of this year. And people even now are doing virtual viewings.""","In the popular surf town of San Juan del Sur, the global pandemic is smothering market gains forged after Nicaragua's political turmoil of 2018.",575f1184-ee28-5909-9915-d340523ac707,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/13/realestate/13IHH-Nicaragua-slide-NZUV/13IHH-Nicaragua-slide-NZUV-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=df908a24854dbd72fa62b5f7ff81876ddb22599d654e60c7e94d0138ec7cfe3a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Built in 2009 using salvaged roof tiles and doors, locally sourced wood and other antique or handcrafted materials, the colonial-style property includes nine total bedrooms.",575f1184-ee28-5909-9915-d340523ac707,Demo_data/D1_img2/1575f1184-ee28-5909-9915-d340523ac707.jpg,7
Opinion,"Yes, Even George Washington",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/28/opinion/george-washington-confederate-statues.html,"On the issue of American slavery, I am an absolutist: enslavers were amoral monsters. The very idea that one group of people believed that they had the right to own another human being is abhorrent and depraved. The fact that their control was enforced by violence was barbaric. People often try to explain this away by saying that the people who enslaved Africans in this country were simply men and women of their age, abiding by the mores of the time. But, that explanation falters. There were also men and women of the time who found slavery morally reprehensible. The enslavers ignored all this and used anti-black dehumanization to justify the holding of slaves and the profiting from slave labor.

People say that some slave owners were kinder than others. That explanation too is problematic. The withholding of another person's freedom is itself violent. And the enslaved people who were shipped to America via the Middle Passage had already endured unspeakably horrific treatment.

One of the few written accounts of the atrocious conditions on these ships comes from a man named the Rev. Robert Walsh. The British government outlawed the international slave trade in 1807, followed by the United States in 1808. The two nations patrolled the seas to prevent people from continuing to kidnap Africans and bringing them to those countries illegally. In 1829, one of the patrols spotted such a ship, and what Walsh saw when he boarded the ship is beyond belief. The ship had been at sea for 17 days. There were over 500 kidnapped Africans onboard. Fifty-five had already been thrown overboard. The Africans were crowded below the main deck. Each deck was only 3 feet 3 inches high. They were packed so tight that they were sitting up between one another's legs, everyone completely nude. As Walsh recounted, ""there was no possibility of their lying down or at all changing their position by night or day."" Each had been branded, ""burnt with the red-hot iron,"" on their breast or arm. Many were children, little girls and little boys.

Not only could light not reach down into the bowels of those ships, neither could fresh air. As Walsh recounted, ""The heat of these horrid places was so great and the odor so offensive that it was quite impossible to enter them, even had there been room."" These people, these human beings, sat in their own vomit, urine and feces, and that of others. If another person sat between your legs, their bowels emptied out on you. These voyages regularly lasted over a month, meaning many women onboard experienced menstruation in these conditions. Many of the enslaved, sick or driven mad, were thrown overboard. Others simply jumped. In fact, there was so much human flesh going over the side of those ships that sharks learned to trail them. This voyage was so horrific that I can only surmise that the men, women and children who survived it were superhuman, the toughest and the most resilient our species has to offer. But of the people who showed up to greet these reeking vessels of human torture, to bid on its cargo, or to in any way benefit from the trade and industry that provided the demand for such a supply, I have absolute contempt. Some people who are opposed to taking down monuments ask, ""If we start, where will we stop?"" It might begin with Confederate generals, but all slave owners could easily become targets. Even George Washington himself.

To that I say, ""abso-fricking-lutely!"" George Washington enslaved more than 100 human beings, and he signed the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, authorizing slavers to stalk runaways even in free states and criminalizing the helping of escaped slaves. When one of the African people he himself had enslaved escaped, a woman named Ona Maria Judge, he pursued her relentlessly, sometimes illegally. Washington would free his slaves in his will, when he no longer had use for them. Let me be clear: Those black people enslaved by George Washington and others, including other founders, were just as much human as I am today. They love, laugh, cry and hurt just like I do. When I hear people excuse their enslavement and torture as an artifact of the times, I'm forced to consider that if slavery were the prevailing normalcy of this time, my own enslavement would also be a shrug of the shoulders. I say that we need to reconsider public monuments in public spaces. No person's honorifics can erase the horror he or she has inflicted on others. Slave owners should not be honored with monuments in public spaces. We have museums for that, which also provide better context. This is not an erasure of history, but rather a better appreciation of the horrible truth of it. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Education,Panel Rejects Proposal to Stop School Closings,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/education/panel-rejects-proposal-to-stop-new-york-city-school-closings.html,"A city panel on Monday night rejected a proposal to stop city-mandated school closings in a tense, often raucous meeting, effectively putting any hopes of reversing Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's education policy into the next mayor's hands. The proposal would have withdrawn current plans to close, co-locate or phase out struggling public schools and also would have placed a moratorium on such future plans until the system, a centerpiece of the mayor's education strategy, could be re-evaluated. The plan was sponsored by four members of the Panel for Educational Policy, a school oversight board, who are not administration appointees. But the rest of the panel, chosen by Mr. Bloomberg, voted the proposal down, prompting accusations that the majority members were puppets of the administration.

""In 10 years, no one's raised a hand against the mayor, because you know you'll get fired if you do,"" said Patrick Sullivan, a panel representative from Manhattan. He was joined in supporting the proposal by the representatives of the Bronx and Queens. Brooklyn's representative abstained. In response to Mr. Sullivan, Judy Bergtraum, a mayoral appointee, retorted: ""We're here because we believe in what's being done."" Several candidates running to replace the mayor have spoken out against the closings, which they say disproportionately affect minority students, wreak havoc on students' academic careers and do not give underperforming schools enough chances to improve. One of those mayoral hopefuls, William C. Thompson Jr., a former city comptroller who previously served as president of the Board of Education, nodded to the importance of the issue among the Democratic candidates. ""I'm amazed I'm the only mayoral candidate here this evening,"" he said during the meeting. ""We're waiting for the next mayor -- I hope it'll be me -- who'll again believe in our children, believe in our communities,"" he said at a news conference before the meeting.

Soon after, Dennis M. Walcott, the schools chancellor, noted that Mr. Thompson himself closed schools during his time on the Board of Education. Also on the agenda for the meeting, which was held at Brooklyn Technical High School, were dozens of proposals to close or phase out schools, or place multiple schools in one building, a practice known as co-locating. Twenty-two schools were up for eventual closing, including the Jonathan Levin High School for Media and Communications, named in honor of a popular teacher who was brutally murdered in 1997. Founded with high hopes, the school has struggled recently, and the panel was expected to approve its closing by the end of Monday's meeting. The city decides which schools to rehabilitate, wind down or close based on letter grades that it assigns based on student test scores and other measures. ""It should be used as a last resort, not a first option,"" Dmytro Fedkowskyj, the Queens representative who introduced the resolution, said of the closings strategy. ""More needs to be done sooner, when the problems are recognized, not three years later."" When Marc Sternberg, a deputy education chancellor, tried to respond, his words were drowned out by chants from the crowd of hundreds of students, teachers and parents, prompting one panel member to repeatedly ask the crowd to be more respectful. ""It goes without saying that these are not easy decisions, and there is no joy for me or my colleagues in having to bring these proposals to you this evening,"" Mr. Sternberg said, adding, ""We have a responsibility to act."" There may have been a vociferous crowd, but many said the meeting was less well-attended than in the past, with the room only half full. Even Michael Mulgrew, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, did not attend, sending a deputy instead.","The vote at a tense and often raucous meeting meant  current plans to close, co-locate or phase out struggling public schools would move forward.",1c6fd5d8-c066-5f69-ac3c-592f439f7997,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/03/12/nyregion/PANEL/PANEL-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=295&w=600&s=c01dfb4c79b4b7142d3d2981d0621387da089a39e0fc0d2ac7188b42a9d78bb8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Spectators at Monday night's meeting at Brooklyn Technical High School.,1c6fd5d8-c066-5f69-ac3c-592f439f7997,Demo_data/D1_img2/11c6fd5d8-c066-5f69-ac3c-592f439f7997.jpg,22
Food,Maryland Rye Whiskey Has Finally Returned. But What Was It in the First Place?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/dining/drinks/rye-whiskey-maryland.html,"Maryland Rye Whiskey Has Finally Returned. But What Was It in the First Place?

BALTIMORE -- H.L. Mencken, the Jazz Age scribe who loved Baltimore and booze in equal measure, spared no opportunity to praise his state's famous rye whiskey. It was, he said, ""the most healthful appetizer yet discovered by man."" The Mencken family doctor, he added, apparently approved: ""He believed and taught that a shot of Maryland whiskey was the best preventive of pneumonia in the R months."" Maryland was once a whiskey distilling powerhouse, surpassed among the states only by Kentucky and Pennsylvania. It produced 5.6 million gallons in 1911, its pre-Prohibition high point -- most of it rye, supposedly made in a distinctive style that was readily recognized from the Midwest to Manhattan. But the distilleries, and the style, disappeared after World War II and the consolidation of the whiskey industry in Kentucky.

""I want to get it back to what it once was,"" said Brian Treacy, the president of the Sagamore Spirit Distillery, which opened in 2017 along a postindustrial stretch of Baltimore dockland. ""It was a regional style then, and it can be a regional style again."" There's just one problem: For all its fame and praise, no one quite knows what ""Maryland style"" meant. Most distillers back before Prohibition did not keep recipes, or document how they made their whiskey . Newspaper accounts differ widely; even Mencken left few clues about his beloved drink. It is one of the great mysteries of the industrial age in America: How could a product so widely appreciated disappear so completely? ""It's a fascinating question, and it's generating a fascinating debate,"" said Teresa DeFlitch, who studies the history of American distilling at Wigle Whiskey, in Pittsburgh.

That debate is about more than just stylistic accuracy. As distillers dig through America's whiskey legacy for inspiration, what does it mean to recreate a ""historic"" style? And do they risk imposing contemporary ideas and categories on a past that might have seen things quite differently? There's no doubt that something called Maryland rye existed at some point. The state was once flush with distilleries -- in 1911 there were 44, half of them in central Baltimore -- and advertisements from the late 19th century promote the drink as a more refined alternative to its rougher cousins from Kentucky and Pennsylvania. One ad, for a brand called Maryland Club, appeared in a leather-bound datebook recovered from the Titanic. Some of that promotion was just marketing. But many distillers and historians today agree that Maryland rye did have a different flavor profile -- sweeter than the rye made farther west, with less spice and a supple, perhaps buttery palate. That, however, is where the agreement ends and the guesswork begins. What, for starters, gave Maryland rye that special sweetness? According to Jaime Windon, a founder of Lyon Distilling, on Maryland's Eastern Shore, and the president of the Maryland Distillers Guild, the state's whiskey makers mixed their rye grain with a high percentage of corn, which lends sweetness to balance the rye's spiciness.

But Ned Wight, who owns New England Distilling and whose great-great-great-grandfather ran one of the largest distilleries in Maryland, says his family's whiskey had no use for corn. (Though based in Portland, Me., his company makes its own Maryland-style rye, called Gunpowder.) ""Generally, old Maryland ryes were made with rye and malted barley,"" Mr. Wight said. The sweetness might have come from using a brewer's yeast to ferment the grain, which produces lighter, more floral notes than a traditional distiller's yeast, he said. Todd Leopold, who also makes a Maryland-style rye at his Leopold Brothers distillery in Denver, splits the difference: Like Sagamore, he uses corn as well as rye in his whiskey, but like Mr. Wight he uses a brewer's yeast, as well as a second fermentation with naturally occurring airborne yeast, to amplify the sweetness. He also employs a custom-made, three-chamber pot still, a piece of equipment rarely seen today but said to be popular in the 19th century because it gave whiskey a rounder, more flavorful character. ""By using these techniques, you can make it so the spicy note in the rye is hardly there at all,"" Mr. Leopold said.

Then again, maybe the sweetness came from somewhere else entirely. Before the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906, it was legal to add fruit juice, caramel and all manner of chemicals to a whiskey. Drinker, beware. Mike Veach, a whiskey historian in Kentucky, said many of the Maryland distilleries before 1906 were actually rectifiers -- plants that bought unaged whiskey from elsewhere, then redistilled it, or aged it, or added something to it to make a final product they could legally call whiskey.

That doesn't mean that Maryland rye was necessarily dangerous or low quality, said John Lipman, another whiskey historian who has done extensive research on Maryland rye; it just wasn't the unadulterated whiskey we expect today. ""Real Maryland rye was a manufactured beverage, like Benedictine,"" he said. While distillery record-keeping improved only marginally in the early 20th century , it seems likely that after the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act, and certainly after Prohibition, Maryland rye lost much of its unusual character. Some skeptics even question whether Maryland rye had anything to distinguish it, apart from where it was made -- and apart from some clever marketing. Sam Komlenic, a whiskey historian in Pennsylvania, believes that Maryland rye whiskey varied too much over time, and that the state's distilleries traded too much product with Pennsylvania distilleries, to allow a clear difference in styles. ""I would like to hope that Maryland rye was as distinctive as people want it to be, but I worry it wasn't,"" he said. Does that mean that Sagamore and its fellow Maryland rye distillers are wrong? Or that everyone is partly right? Because the more you dive into the question of what Maryland rye was, the more you realize that you're asking the wrong question. Modern ideas about what constitutes a style are hemmed in by a long list of laws, standards and customs, and policed by constant chatter in the media and online. We obsess over how something is made, and imagine that people in the past did, too. But what if they didn't?

""Strictly speaking, 'Maryland style' didn't mean as much back then as it does now,"" said Max Lents, a founder of the Baltimore Spirits Company, which makes a Maryland-style rye. The fuzziness around the definition of Maryland rye may be exactly the point. Before social media, before Prohibition, before the Pure Food and Drug Act and the modernization of distilling, inconsistency was a given. Maybe it was even prized. Rye grain was prevalent in the Mid-Atlantic, so distillers used that. But if there was corn growing nearby, they used that, too. Before laboratory-grown yeast emerged in the 20th century, they developed their yeast cultures from whatever happened to be floating in the air nearby. Those might make the whiskey taste dramatically different from an identical batch made a few miles away. And even where there was consistency in a flavor profile, that likely changed over the years, as new rules and changing consumer tastes forced the industry to shift. ""At different points in time there were different understandings of what Maryland rye was, and even then it depended on who you talked to,"" said Ms. DeFlitch, of Wigle Whiskey. In other words, one reason to celebrate Maryland rye is that no one can quite agree on what the term meant: It demonstrates the diversity within whiskey regions, as in local food styles more broadly, before the mid-20th century. ""Trying to overdefine something doesn't actually carry on that tradition,"" Ms. DeFlitch said. Instead, distillers should embrace the uncertainty. ""The more inspiration we have today, the better.""","Distillers say they've revived a long-lost favorite, but they face a conundrum: Nobody really knows how the old stuff was made.",5a9b49bd-0a8b-558b-935e-939c4d418a3f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/20/dining/20rye1/20rye1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=7fcdff0f1c4ab8df719e5a77a7e083cc37a7b839d35f6ddd290f88844297bf28&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sagamore Spirit, in Baltimore, is one of several distilleries trying to resurrect Maryland-style rye whiskey.

Media,'We Shall Overcome' Is Put in Public Domain in a Copyright Settlement,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/business/media/we-shall-overcome-copyright.html,"The two sides in a legal dispute over whether the song ""We Shall Overcome"" was subject to copyright protection reached a settlement on Friday that put the civil rights anthem in the public domain, lawyers involved in the case said. Two plaintiffs, the makers of a documentary on the song's history and producers of the 2013 film ""Lee Daniels' The Butler,"" who wanted to use part of the song in the movie, challenged its copyright protection in federal court. The documentarians had been denied permission and the moviemakers were asked to pay as much as $100,000 to use it in several critical scenes, according to the law firm representing the plaintiffs. In September, a federal judge partly rejected the copyright claim, saying the song's adaptation from an older work -- including changing ""will"" to ""shall"" -- was not original enough to qualify for protection.

That decision, by Judge Denise L. Cote of United States District Court in Manhattan, focused on the first verse, which has the lyrics ""We shall overcome/We shall overcome some day"" and ""Oh deep in my heart I do believe/We shall overcome some day."" Judge Cote granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs, saying that the song ""lacks originality,"" and focused in her ruling on the changing of ""will"" to ""shall."" The song's origins have been traced to spirituals at the turn of the 20th century. In 1960 and 1963, the publisher Ludlow Music registered copyrights for it, saying that the song's authors -- including Pete Seeger -- had made changes to earlier versions of it.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The plaintiffs sought to have the copyright for the entire song declared invalid, with the case set for trial next month. The litigation, which began in 2016, had become expensive and Ludlow spent far more on the case than it had earned on the song in recent years, Paul V. LiCalsi, a lawyer for Ludlow and the other defendant, the Richmond Organization, said in a telephone interview on Friday night.

In a statement, Ludlow said royalties from the song since the early 1960s had been donated to the nonprofit Highlander Research and Education Center in Tennessee, which created the We Shall Overcome Fund to distribute all of the royalties through grants and scholarships in black communities. It was not immediately clear how much money the fund had distributed. ""Without the same scope of copyright protection, Highlander's grants and scholarships will be deeply affected in the future,"" the statement said. Ludlow also said uses of the song had in the past been ""carefully vetted"" but warned that its words and melody could now be used by advertising agencies and others ""in any manner they wish, including inaccurate historical uses, commercials, parodies, spoofs and jokes, and even for political purposes by those who oppose civil rights for all Americans."" The settlement was ""an enormously important achievement"" because others can now use the song without paying for it or seeking permission, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, Mark C. Rifkin, said in a telephone interview on Friday night. ""We're really thrilled to be part of an effort to give this song back to the public where it belongs,"" he said. The case is the latest one to cancel the copyright of a time-honored song that many people may well assume was available for anyone to sing: A judge invalidated the copyright on ""Happy Birthday to You"" in 2015.",A case in federal court was set to go to trial next month but a settlement reached on Friday makes the civil rights anthem freely available.,61556e21-cae0-571d-8853-aa17ead210ce,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/13/business/27xp-Song-1/13overcome-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=40f4cf113fcc7ed0b28f9abd25e384f7170949e0f646d3bd5b9039e4d6260846&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A crowd organized by the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee sang ""We Shall Overcome"" in Farmville, Va., in 1966, after a speech by Stokely Carmichael.",61556e21-cae0-571d-8853-aa17ead210ce,Demo_data/D1_img2/161556e21-cae0-571d-8853-aa17ead210ce.jpg,16
Science,First All-Female Spacewalk Canceled Because NASA Doesn't Have Two Suits That Fit,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/science/female-spacewalk-canceled.html,"First All-Female Spacewalk Canceled Because NASA Doesn't Have Two Suits That Fit

It hadn't been planned as a historic mission, yet it would have represented a moment of sorts: the first all-female spacewalk. But that moment will have to wait, NASA said Monday, because of a somewhat basic issue -- spacesuit sizes. The two astronauts who were scheduled to walk together in space on Friday, Anne C. McClain and Christina H. Koch, would both need to wear a medium-size torso component. But only one is readily available at the International Space Station.

[Read about the Trump administration's pledge to return to the moon within 5 years.] The mission itself is unchanged. On Friday, two astronauts will venture outside of the space station on a six-hour mission to install massive lithium-ion batteries that will help to power the research laboratory. Ms. Koch is still scheduled to participate, along with her fellow astronaut Nick Hague; Ms. McClain did her first spacewalk last week.

But the first women-only venture outside of the confines of the space station will have to happen on another day. ""After consulting with McClain and Hague following the first spacewalk, mission managers decided to adjust the assignments, due in part to spacesuit availability on the station,"" NASA said in a statement. Stephanie Schierholz, a spokeswoman for NASA, said in an interview on Monday that there were already two medium-size hard upper torsos -- ""essentially the shirt of the spacesuit,"" according to NASA -- at the space station. But there were a couple of issues. One was that Ms. McClain had thought she would be able to work in a large-size torso, but after her spacewalk last Friday, she wore a medium-size torso and learned that it fit her better. Ms. Koch also uses the same size. And of the two medium-size torsos available, one has yet to be properly configured for a spacewalk. It would take hours of crew labor -- not to mention some additional risk -- to fix that in time for Friday. Instead of doing that, NASA decided to simply switch out the astronauts.

In the end, both women will have done a spacewalk -- just not together. ""When you have the option of just switching the people, the mission becomes more important than a cool milestone,"" Ms. Schierholz said. [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] On Friday, Ms. Koch and Mr. Hague will be supported by a team on the ground that includes a number of women in key positions, including the spacewalk's flight director, Mary Lawrence, and its lead officer, Jackie Kagey. In a briefing at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston this month, Ms. Lawrence, Ms. Kagey and Kenneth Todd, the station's operations integration manager, said officials had not immediately recognized the significance of the original lineup for Friday's ""extravehicular activity,"" or EVA. It was only as they discussed the schedule during a meeting that they realized it was the first time they had scheduled an all-female spacewalk.

""We're sort of getting to the point of inevitability,"" Ms. Schierholz said of an all-female EVA. Ms. McClain and Ms. Koch were part of the 2013 astronaut class, and of the eight people in that class -- chosen from more than 6,000 applicants -- half were women, a first for NASA. The agency lists 38 active astronauts on its website, and 12 are women. The current roster of six astronauts at the space station -- three Americans, one Canadian and two Russians -- allows the team to carry out a number of important projects, with an eye toward making sure each crew member accumulates significant experience, Mr. Todd said. NASA officials hope the relatively young American astronauts will continue to travel to space in the coming years and assist new recruits in the future. The batteries being installed on this mission store solar power that the station needs when it is not in direct sunlight. Work on the battery systems will continue for the next few years as international teams bring more lithium-ion batteries to the station, which is more than 200 miles from Earth.

Media,"Trump's Blocking of Twitter Users Is Unconstitutional, Judge Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/business/media/trump-twitter-block.html,"Apart from the man himself, perhaps nothing has defined President Trump's political persona more than Twitter. But on Wednesday, one of Mr. Trump's Twitter habits -- his practice of blocking critics on the service, preventing them from engaging with his account -- was declared unconstitutional by a federal judge in Manhattan. Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald, addressing a novel issue about how the Constitution applies to social media platforms and public officials, found that the president's Twitter feed is a public forum. As a result, she ruled that when Mr. Trump or an aide blocked seven plaintiffs from viewing and replying to his posts, he violated the First Amendment. If the principle undergirding Wednesday's ruling in Federal District Court stands, it is likely to have implications far beyond Mr. Trump's feed and its 52 million followers, said Jameel Jaffer, the Knight First Amendment Institute's executive director and the counsel for the plaintiffs. Public officials throughout the country, from local politicians to governors and members of Congress, regularly use social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to interact with the public about government business.

[Read more: Twitter users talk about getting blocked by the president.] ""This ruling should put them on notice, and if they censor critics from social media accounts used for official purposes, they run the risk that someone will sue them and win,"" he said of public officials. Asked whether the administration would unblock the users or appeal the ruling, Kerri Kupec, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department's civil division, demurred from making any specific pronouncement. ""We respectfully disagree with the court's decision and are considering our next steps,"" she said. In her ruling, Judge Buchwald said Mr. Trump and Dan Scavino, the White House social media director, ""exert governmental control over certain aspects of the @realDonaldTrump account."" But she did not issue an injunction ordering Mr. Trump or Mr. Scavino to unblock the users, a nod to the separation-of-powers sensitivities of a judge's ordering a president to do something. Rather, her ruling simply declared what the Constitution requires, with the expectation that the White House would comply. ""Because no government official is above the law and because all government officials are presumed to follow the law once the judiciary has said what the law is, we must assume that the president and Scavino will remedy the blocking we have held to be unconstitutional,"" she wrote in her ruling.

The plaintiffs had argued that Mr. Trump's Twitter feed is an official government account and that blocking users from following it is a violation of their First Amendment rights. In June, the plaintiffs had sent a letter to the White House asking to be unblocked. When that went ignored, they sued.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Their complaint argued that Mr. Trump's feed amounted to a ""digital town hall"" where not only did the president and his aides communicate information but members of the public -- by replying to Mr. Trump's tweets and others who responded to him -- exchanged views with one another. By blocking particular people from viewing or replying to message chains because they had expressed views he did not like, it argued, Mr. Trump had violated their First Amendment rights. Judge Buchwald, who was appointed to the federal bench in 1999 by President Bill Clinton, agreed. ""The viewpoint-based exclusion of the individual plaintiffs from that designated public forum is proscribed by the First Amendment and cannot be justified by the president's personal First Amendment interests,"" she wrote. The ruling also rejected the government's claim that Mr. Trump operates the account merely in a personal capacity, concluding that he ""uses the account to take actions that can be taken only by the president as president."" Judge Buchwald, however, did dismiss Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, and Hope Hicks, the former communications director, as defendants because Ms. Sanders does not have access to the account and Ms. Hicks no longer works in the administration. Mr. Jaffer said Mr. Trump or Mr. Scavino should simply unblock the users. If they do not, the next step could be to seek an injunction. (Judge Buchwald mentioned that possibility, writing that ""injunctive relief directed at Scavino"" was one of the options that ""remain available."")

""The position the Trump administration is taking is that the president is entitled to block people, and that the court lacks the ability to order him to do otherwise,"" Mr. Jaffer said. ""The right thing for the president and his social media director to do would be to log into the president's account and unblock everyone who has been blocked on the basis of viewpoint."" 

 There have been other legal cases involving public officials and their social media activity. In April, Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland settled a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland and several other plaintiffs who accused him of censorship on government-operated Facebook pages. A similar federal lawsuit filed against Gov. Paul R. LePage of Maine is awaiting a ruling. In a March hearing, Judge Buchwald had suggested that Mr. Trump has the right to ignore whomever he pleases on Twitter, and that the ""Mute"" feature is a constitutional option for doing so. Using that feature would hide selected users' posts from Mr. Trump's view. She urged the two parties to consider that possibility as a way to settle the matter. But the president's preference for blocking -- which renders Twitter users unable to interact directly with his posts, or with other users in the space beneath those posts -- amounts to barring Americans from a public forum, in the judge's view. Indeed, many of the tweets for which users were blocked were attempts to join the sprawling conversations that take place around the president's feed. Nick Pappas, a comic and writer, was blocked after replying to the president in June. Mr. Trump had tweeted, ""The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version!"" Mr. Pappas replied: ""Trump is right. The government should protect the people. That's why the courts are protecting us from him."" Another plaintiff, Rebecca Buckwalter, who is now an editor for the left-leaning website The Daily Kos, was blocked for replying to a June tweet from Mr. Trump that read, ""Sorry folks, but if I would have relied on the Fake News of CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, washpost or nytimes, I would have had ZERO chance winning WH."" ""To be fair you didn't win the WH: Russia won it for you,"" Ms. Buckwalter tweeted, shortly before being blocked. After Wednesday's ruling, she took to Twitter again: ""I sued the President, and I won.""",A federal judge in Manhattan ruled on Wednesday that President Trump's practice of blocking Twitter users who criticize him is unconstitutional.,a15932df-63da-5ef3-b413-55c34b578c00,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/24/business/24trumptwitter-jump-print/24TRUMPBLOCK-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=df04e9e20c496edb3ff8d78f3c8196fadd72bb5cedcd77436360183ab8464049&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,President Trump has 52 million followers on Twitter.

Movies,"In 'Abominable,' Asian Actors Play Asian Characters. What a Novelty.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/movies/abominable-asian-americans.html,"When I first heard about ""Abominable,"" the animated movie centered on a modern Chinese family, I opened IMDb.com on my phone to look up the cast. I grimaced at the name of the actress playing the movie's main character: Chloe Bennet. I showed my phone to my wife and said, ""Can you believe it? Hollywood has done it again. This is a movie about some kids in China rescuing a yeti, and the actor playing the main character isn't even Asian."" My wife, also Asian-American, was quick to set the record straight. ""Actually, that's Chloe Wang,"" she said. ""She's pretty cool."" She went on to explain that Wang was the half-Chinese, half-white actress known for being outspoken about Hollywood's racism toward Asian-Americans. Casting directors had rarely considered her for roles until she started using Bennet (her father's first name). My rage immediately melted into embarrassment, then appreciation. In an industry in which we're scarcely represented -- 3.4 percent of film roles went to Asian-Americans in 2017, according to a Hollywood diversity report by University of California, Los Angeles -- here was a big-studio movie with Chinese characters voiced mainly by Asian-Americans , an occurrence as rare as a solar eclipse. The last time I could remember this happening was more than 20 years ago with Disney's ""Mulan.""

In interviews, the makers of ""Abominable"" said their mission was to achieve authenticity. The director, Jill Culton, who had worked on ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Monsters, Inc.,"" described how her team went to great lengths to accurately portray Chinese culture, weaving in details like the Shanghai-inspired city's use of rubber trash cans (instead of metal), and the children's favorite snack, steamed pork buns. So there was no question that the Chinese characters should be voiced by people of Asian heritage, Culton added. ""I would never want a Caucasian actor representing a Chinese character,"" she said. ""You're trying to represent a different culture, and when you do that, especially as a director, you have to tread carefully.""

Yet in the past that wasn't the road taken by some directors. The last big-budget Hollywood animation featuring an Asian family was ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" in 2016, which featured the voices of Art Parkinson, Charlize Theron and Matthew McConaughey. (At the time, the director Travis Knight said that while he believed inclusion and representation mattered, voice acting involved different considerations.) More controversial was the 2017 live-action adaptation of the Japanese anime ""Ghost in the Shell,"" with Scarlett Johansson as Major Killian, better known as Major Kusanagi in the original. A year before that, the Marvel blockbuster ""Doctor Strange"" featured Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, who was an Asian man in the source material. Asian-Americans make up the fastest-growing demographic in the United States, according to the Pew Research Center. So why is the group barely visible on the big screen?

Donatella Galella, a professor of theater history and theory at the University of California, Riverside, said that the issue has its roots in American theater. The lack of Asians -- and their marginalized roles -- onstage may have been a symptom of the Western world's xenophobia in the late 1800s and onward . Galella pointed to the Russo-Japanese war in 1905, in which the Japanese defeated the Russians, as a key historical event that stoked fear about East Asians posing a threat to the West. During that era, when more Chinese were immigrating to the United States, some plays portrayed Asian characters in minor roles -- often as villains, Galella said. Other plays characterized Asian men as effeminate and desexualized, stemming from the societal fear that they would reproduce with white women and pose an existential threat to the race. (Around this time, the United States enacted laws that could strip a white woman of her citizenship if she married an Asian man. )

On American stages today, important feeders for Hollywood, Asians are still underrepresented. Only 7.3 percent of acting roles on Broadway and at New York's largest nonprofit theaters went to people of Asian heritage in the 2016-17 season, according to the Asian-American Performers Coalition, a grass-roots organization seeking to expand representation onstage. (Asian-Americans make up 12.7 percent of New York's population.) Darnell Hunt, a sociology professor at U.C.L.A. who leads the university's Hollywood diversity report, said the lack of Asian-American representation on the big screen is also a reflection of the lack of minorities in Hollywood's executive roles. At major studios, the key decision makers who greenlight projects are mostly white men. If more people of color were in those positions, they would probably have different perceptions about what viewers want, like minority actors in major roles, he said. Case in point: Kevin Tsujihara, the former head of Warner Bros., was the first executive of Asian descent to run a big Hollywood studio, and he played an important role in fast-tracking the production of ""Crazy Rich Asians."" (He resigned this year amid accusations that he promised an actress auditions in exchange for sex.) Hunt added that it was too soon to predict whether movies like ""Crazy Rich Asians"" or ""Abominable"" would affect representation in the long term. He noted that he had not seen an increase in the number of Asian-Americans in Hollywood's executive suites. ""Asian-Americans have not been at the table,"" he said. Bennet said that she was hopeful that ""Abominable"" would help accelerate her career. But she was uncertain about whether this movie, along with the string of recent hits with Asian-American casts, was a watershed moment.

""Abominable"" underlines what can result from a diverse set of people behind the scenes. The movie was a co-production between the American studio DreamWorks Animation and China's Pearl Studio. One of the producers, Peilin Chou, said she and the rest of the team worked diligently to cast actors of Asian descent. In addition to Bennet as Yi, the heroine, the chief supporting characters, Peng and Jin, were voiced by Asian-American actors, Albert Tsai and Tenzing Trainor. ""From moment one it was something that was born of two cultures, and I think that right there was a foundation of how we wanted to approach this film,"" Chou said. What ""Abominable"" lacks, however, is a big celebrity name to help sell tickets. Bennet is not well-known outside of her role in the TV show ""Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" Even lesser known are Tsai and Trainor, who have TV roles in ""Fresh Off the Boat"" and ""Clueless."" It's unclear whether the lack of a star in ""Abominable"" will affect its financial success. But Chou, the producer, said there was a chicken-and-egg problem: If the major studios only want to cast celebrities to attract audiences, how will Asian-Americans ever gain fame if they don't get a chance to be onscreen? That, perhaps, is what is most remarkable about ""Abominable"": not the story or the visuals, but the chance it is taking on Bennet and her peers.","Also rare for a big-studio animated feature, it's centered on a modern Chinese family.

Television,Why the Creator of 'Dear White People' Is Doubling Down on Identity Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/arts/television/dear-white-people-creator-doubles-down-on-identity-politics.html,"Justin Simien, the creator of the movie and Netflix show ""Dear White People,"" sees the role of the storyteller as giving people something they haven't seen before or showing them how to think in a new way.

Justin Simien, the 35-year-old creator of ""Dear White People,"" is no stranger to provocation. The satirical comedy, first a movie and now a Netflix show, revolves around five black students -- Sam, Coco, Troy, Lionel and Reggie -- at a fictional elite university who revel in the sorts of intemperate and intoxicating polemics that can sour a Thanksgiving dinner. A story line from the first season about an app called ""Woke or Not,"" for example, mercilessly parodied the characters' self-conscious commitment to social justice. But even Mr. Simien was not prepared for the controversy that engulfed the TV show's rollout. After Netflix first released a teaser trailer last February, Mr. Simien was inundated with critical messages online, promoting the hashtag #BoycottNetflix and excoriating him for ""reverse racism."" ""I read this review on some conservative site because I was so curious where it all was coming from,"" Mr. Simien recalled in an interview at the Netflix offices in Manhattan late last month. ""It was like they'd watched the show just enough to give their readers the impression that they'd watched it and then came up with the most insane interpretations. It wasn't that they didn't get it, it was that they refused to get it.""

Mr. Simien, who speaks in paragraphs and variously quoted Malcolm X, Eckhart Tolle and RuPaul, discussed why the new season never mentions President Trump by name, what black auteurs owe to their audiences and his upcoming horror film about a (literal) killer weave. ""Any chance you get as a storyteller to make people see something that they never saw before, or to think in a new way -- that's the job,"" he said. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. There was some controversy over the title of the show last season, and this season the Sam character, who hosts a radio show within the show, also called ""Dear White People,"" deals with her own similar controversy. How did you digest all of the feedback from Season 1? The backlash stuff was really interesting to me. They were so organized and they didn't just come after us, they came after anything black -- there were campaigns against ""Black Panther,"" too. I was so curious about it and I did a deep dive and started to try to figure out what were the tactics that they used and how were they so mobilized.

The other big thing that informed this season was that Trump won on the day we wrapped Season 1. And I was just so bewildered by how we got here. I started to really research and not just assume that I knew. I read a book called ""The History of White People,"" about all of the cultural decisions that led to the creation of the white race and why white is the ideal form of beauty, and it's so arbitrary. I realized that the reason we can't talk to each other is because people don't know where this all comes from. So this season has a lot of history on its mind, too.

When you're investigating those questions on the show, do you worry that white people will just choose not to engage? I think the key to the show is making you care about the characters first, because it's not a thesis. And if we tell the truth about what they're going through, then maybe you'll care and think about it. I think the show has two goals. One is to allow people who don't necessarily look like us to see themselves in characters they don't expect to, so that the next time they see a black guy at Starbucks, they won't feel the need to call the cops on him. And the other thing is to make people who've actually gone through these experiences go: ""Oh my God, totally. I'm so glad someone finally put it that way."" I think both of those things allow black folks to feel more human in society.

What do you make of the idea that obsessive focus on identity is inherently divisive, and that minorities would be better served by a politics that focuses on what we all have in common? I think people who are privileged can say something like that. Because the truth is, I could walk around all day saying: ""I don't identify with being black. I don't identify with being gay."" But you know what's going to happen to me? Society's going to happen to me. I'm going to go into Starbucks and get arrested, or I'm going to walk through the wrong neighborhood in a hoodie. When you don't have to have the burden of identity, when you don't have to code switch every day or constantly be aware of your surroundings, you get to say that. Part of the reason the show is called ""Dear White People"" is because there's no way to be black in America without constantly having to explain or protect or defend yourself. Talking about that is not why Donald Trump is president. The new season doesn't mention Trump by name. Why not? I just didn't want to say his name. I didn't want to give it that kind of power. I think the underlying issues that brought about the Trump presidency are American issues, and they've been around before Trump and they'll be around after Trump.

He is African. And his accent is based on an actual Kenyan accent, but people thought it was too sing-songy. So we brought in the woman who was the dialect coach for ""Black Panther"" to give it some flavor and some nuance. But I'm sure people will still be mad. Here's the thing about being a black creator: [Scrutiny] is part of being in the ring. Black folks and the black diaspora are so starved for content that when you're the only person telling the story there's all these people that are like, ""Well where's my story?"" I remember reading this article about how ""Black Panther"" had failed the queer community by not expressing LGBT issues. And I was like, but it did so many things! It's literally changed cinema for black people forever, and was an all-black cast, and made all the money in the world, and introduced African themes, and is opening in Saudia Arabia ... but we didn't have gay characters. So let's just throw the whole thing away. That kind of thing can be a lot. But it's the cost of telling stories in an oppressive society. You have to be prepared to take some of those jabs and you do the best that you can. Your next movie, ""Bad Hair,"" is about a woman who's possessed by a sentient killer weave. Where'd you get the idea? I always write because I'm really angry about something, and I was so angry that people weren't seeing how black women are getting it from all angles. [If you're a black woman,] you're at the bottom of the totem pole, even though black women are always among the strongest members of our society and culture. I was also really inspired by Korean horror movies, because hair possession is a subgenre there. I was just thinking, ""How would we do this in America?"" And of course it couldn't just be fun -- I always have to have something to say.","For Season 2 of the satirical Netflix comedy, the writer and director Justin Simien wanted to answer one question: ""How did we get here?""",c22824b5-dc63-5c53-849b-f9af32b3ca0c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/04/arts/04showrunner-print/03showrunner-simien1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=108da926a01a820bfa730d48fd9848b0957941490fbe928655680f6da4461654&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Justin Simien, the creator of the movie and Netflix show &ldquo;Dear White People,&rdquo; sees the role of the storyteller as giving people something they haven&rsquo;t seen before or showing them how to think in a new way.",c22824b5-dc63-5c53-849b-f9af32b3ca0c,Demo_data/D1_img2/1c22824b5-dc63-5c53-849b-f9af32b3ca0c.jpg,3
Dance,"Review: In 'Bladder Inn,' Waiting for Dancers to Wander Away",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/arts/dance/review-in-bladder-inn-waiting-for-dancers-to-wander-away.html,"What if a group of dancers, mid-performance, just wandered away and didn't come back? On Thursday at Danspace Project, during the premiere of Mina Nishimura's ""Bladder Inn (and X, Y, Z, W),"" such a development often seemed imminent. In a loosely knit hourlong show that spilled from the sanctuary of St. Mark's Church into its back rooms and balconies, Ms. Nishimura, one of eight dancers, created not so much a world as an atmosphere, a web of activity on the brink of dissolving.

An entrancing performer in her own work and others' -- like that of her husband, Kota Yamazaki, and the choreographer Dean Moss -- Ms. Nishimura can't help but be a focal point onstage. (Mr. Moss's ""Petra,"" just last week, included a brilliant autobiographical monologue that she wrote and delivered.) She doesn't demand attention, she just attracts it, in part through her ability to embody multiple qualities at the same time. An action as simple as walking becomes riveting through the illusion of a floating torso supported by weighted, wooden legs. Details as fine as a corner of the mouth, isolated and upturned while the opposite corner rests, spring into view. Often she appears animated, spookily, by forces outside of herself.

Like other dancer-choreographers with distinctive ways of moving, Ms. Nishimura faces the challenge of translating that style onto fellow performers. In ""Bladder Inn"" (what to make of the title?), no one quite matches her strange interiority and specificity. But rather than fighting that difference, she folds it into the format of the work. The piece takes shape as a suite of concurrent solos, each dancer roaming around on his or her own phantomlike terms: crawling backward through open doors, grazing bare walls, staggering out from hallways and stairwells we can't see.

The house lights, for the most part, stay up. Distant murmurs and slamming doors mingle with the clacking and oceanic undulations in Masahiro Sugaya's unobtrusive score. So do the dancers' vocalizations, like Jonathan Burklund yelling ""Hey!"" in time with the flick of a hand, or Samuel Hanson howling, or Lydia Chrisman singing a few crystal-clear notes.","Mina Nishimura's new work at Danspace creates not so much a world, but an atmosphere, a web of activity on the brink of dissolving.",c1dc317a-a190-59da-bb2d-b17d0617c8a0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/03/arts/03NISHIMURA-REVIEW/03NISHIMURA-REVIEW-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=e95a3fd17ccbe6d1162820af2f2ee0bf24d381037ad6b2130b8639981993a624&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mina Nishimura in her ""Bladder Inn (X, Y, Z, W).""",c1dc317a-a190-59da-bb2d-b17d0617c8a0,Demo_data/D1_img2/1c1dc317a-a190-59da-bb2d-b17d0617c8a0.jpg,6
Television,Late Night Laughs Off Trump's Saying Hosts Have Zero Talent,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/arts/television/late-night-trump-coronavirus.html,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night's highlights that lets you sleep -- and lets us get paid to watch comedy. We're all stuck at home at the moment, so here are the 50 best movies on Netflix right now. In an interview published Tuesday, President Trump told The New York Post that he would most likely skip this year's White House Correspondents' Association dinner, reciting his usual complaints about unfair treatment from the press. He singled out the 2011 host, Seth Meyers, calling him ""a no-talent comic"" and ""nasty,"" before saying that both Meyers and , host of ""The Late Show,"" are unfunny. Trump followed with a tweet praising the Fox News host Greg Gutfeld and taking a swipe at Colbert, Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel. A few of the hosts responded to the president in their Tuesday night monologues.

""Well, I can't speak for Seth.

Movies,'Graves Without a Name' Review: An Impossible Quest in Cambodia,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/movies/graves-without-a-name-review.html,"For years, people in the arts or in journalism have, in conversation, said of their vocation, ""I didn't choose it; it chose me."" At times this is an at least half-glib attempt to rationalize the often nonremunerative nature of their endeavors. But the truism gains some heft if looked at from a different angle.

Consider the film artists whose work could not escape, even had they wanted it to, a world-historic trauma that also had a profound personal meaning for them. One thinks of Claude Lanzmann and the Holocaust. One wonders what the Russian filmmaker Aleksei German would have done had Stalin never existed, or what the filmmaker Edward Yang's oeuvre might look like had the specter of the militaristic Kuomintang government not haunted it.

Yang and German were fiction filmmakers. Lanzmann was a documentarian. The Cambodian-born director Rithy Panh, whose impetus for filmmaking was Pol Pot, works in both fiction and documentaries; the documentaries are especially distinctive and imaginative, and in recent years, more and more personal.

Panh's father was a minister of education in the regime preceding that of the Khmer Rouge, which brutalized his family after coming to power. Panh escaped Cambodia as a teenager and discovered filmmaking during his education in France. His 2014 feature ""The Missing Picture"" grappled with his family tragedy and depicted its personages, including his mother and father, in the form of artful clay figurines.","The filmmaker Rithy Panh attempts to find where his parents, victims of the Khmer Rouge, are buried.",23a7b8dc-653f-5287-b17a-5d26304f64f6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/14/arts/14graveswithout/14graveswithout-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=db25c408dda0256513d62b43b36b3e08abaf2a06046ec5f778f67acae3bd78ea&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A scene from ""Graves Without a Name,"" a documentary directed by Rithy Panh.",23a7b8dc-653f-5287-b17a-5d26304f64f6,Demo_data/D1_img2/123a7b8dc-653f-5287-b17a-5d26304f64f6.jpg,5
Books,"A Dark New Satire Asks, How Far Would You Go to Become Famous?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/books/review/ladder-to-sky-john-boyne.html,"The question writers are asked most often is Where do you get your ideas? And the answers -- ranging from the occult to the mundane -- always seem to disappoint. Perhaps a better answer is the one Maurice Swift, the protagonist of 's new novel, ""A Ladder to the Sky,"" gives: ""The answer is no one knows where they come from and nobody should know.""

Not the most original response, but to be fair, Maurice Swift is a plagiarist.

While Maurice Swift lacks a nose for original story, he's an expert at sniffing out opportunities for advancement by exploiting, in particular, the libidinous desires of older gay authors. Unencumbered by any sense of shame, and driven by a pathological level of ambition, Maurice has the heart of a sniper. Fortunately for him, almost all of his material, whether in the form of story or professional connections, comes his way with an-antelope-stumbles-in-front-of-a-lion serendipity. It helps that along with his charm and intellect (he jousts in Latin with Gore Vidal), Maurice is also disconcertingly attractive to both women and men.

There is little sport for Maurice at 22, a Caravaggio in his Savoy waiter's uniform working the bar, in landing his first conquest, Erich Ackermann, a closeted 66-year-old professor at Cambridge (wink, wink) and prizewinning novelist. Soon smitten, Ackermann unwittingly provides Maurice with a story -- a devastating betrayal he committed out of lust during his time as a member of Hitler Youth -- which Maurice pockets as easily as an apple. The seeds of it will become his debut novel, ""Two Germans."" While the publicity is personally and professionally shattering for Ackermann, it catapults Maurice into the center of London's literary society.","A grasping, conniving young writer schemes his way to the top in ""A Ladder to the Sky,"" John Boyne's dark satire of literary ambition.",a9fc9165-16fd-5908-874a-fea4b3d0a0b1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/25/books/review/25Schappell1/25Schappell1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=8ae4df79223538853bc1ee87ac0c2d6156ba9bb1861ff0b6f34fd99c3bb7d6be&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,John Boyne,a9fc9165-16fd-5908-874a-fea4b3d0a0b1,Demo_data/D1_img2/1a9fc9165-16fd-5908-874a-fea4b3d0a0b1.jpg,13
Science,"How Universities Deal With Sexual Harassment Needs Sweeping Change, Panel Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/science/sexual-harassment-science-medicine-engineering.html,"Years of efforts to prevent sexual harassment in science, engineering and medicine have failed, and universities need to make sweeping changes in the way they deal with the issue, a searing new report by a national advisory panel concluded on Tuesday. ""There is no evidence to suggest that current policies, procedures, and approaches have resulted in a significant reduction in sexual harassment,"" said the report, which was more than two years in the making, starting well before the #MeToo era. It was issued by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, independent agencies that advise the government and the public. The panel offered 15 detailed recommendations, some of which would upend long-entrenched practices in academia. Institutions should overhaul their academic advising systems, for example, it said, so students and junior researchers are not dependent on one senior researcher for advancement and access to grants. The report also urged legislators to pass laws so people can file harassment lawsuits directly against faculty and not just the university, and so employees who settle harassment complaints cannot keep them confidential from another prospective academic employer.

The 311-page document is the national academies' first report addressing sexual harassment, a problem that has long simmered in labs and classrooms, and some people predicted it could help spur meaningful change. ""Reports from the National Academy carry substantial weight,"" said Dr. Carol Bates, associate dean for faculty affairs at Harvard Medical School and a co-author of a recent article calling for ""zero tolerance for sexual harassment in academic medicine."" But, she noted, ""none of it is easy or we would have fixed it already. We haven't fixed it in any other domain in society either."" Academic workplaces are second only to the military in the rate of sexual harassment, with 58 percent of academic employees indicating they had such experiences, according to one study cited in the report. Among the data involving students in scientific fields, the report cited a 2017 survey by the University of Texas system, which found that about 20 percent of female science students, more than 25 percent of female engineering students and more than 40 percent of female medical students experienced sexual harassment from faculty or staff members. The issue is also a sensitive one for the National Academies because some of their own members have been found to have committed sexual misconduct at their universities. Responding to questions at a briefing on the report, Bruce Darling, the executive officer of the academies, said the institutions were considering trying to oust members who committed harassment, but doing so would require a lengthy process dependent on voting by members, so other measures are being considered in the interim.

The panel said universities and other institutions have been too focused on ""symbolic compliance with current law and avoiding liability and not on preventing sexual harassment."" Fear of being held liable may have kept many institutions from even evaluating their prevention programs, the report asserted; if they did, ""they would likely find them to be ineffective."" ""We really have to move beyond a mind-set of legal compliance and liability and think about the ways we can change the climate,"" said Dr. Paula A. Johnson, the president of Wellesley College and a co-chairwoman of the committee that produced the report, in an interview. Dr. Paula A. Johnson, the president of Wellesley College, co-chaired the committee that produced the report. The committee identified three types of sexual harassment: sexual coercion, unwanted sexual attention and gender harassment. It said gender harassment, ""verbal and nonverbal behaviors that convey hostility, objectification, exclusion or second-class status,"" was by far the most common type women experienced. ""As opposed to the come-ons, you can kind of think of them as the put-downs,"" said Dr. Johnson, who is also a cardiologist and former chief of the women's health division at Brigham and Women's Hospital. She said gender harassment creates a culture that fosters the other types of sexual harassment. The committee said gender harassment was more pervasive in medicine than in the other sciences, partly because harassment can come from patients, as well as colleagues. In any form, the costs for women -- and for the ability of scientific fields to retain the full range of talented people -- can be great, even if the consequences can seem subtle at first, the panel said.

It ""undermines work and well-being in a whole host of ways,"" triggering symptoms like depression, sleep disruption, cardiac stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder, said Lilia Cortina, a panel member and professor of psychology and women's studies at the University of Michigan. She said experiences can be worse for women of color and lesbian, bisexual or transgender women. But they also affect witnesses to the behavior, further impeding the scientific work. ""Women leave, their co-workers leave, even the men leave -- they don't' stick around to watch their valued colleagues being disparaged and they certainly don't want to become the next victim,"" Dr. Cortina said during the briefing. One paradox is that academia's emphasis on merit-based advancement can discourage women from reporting harassment and limit their career progress, the committee noted. ""The system of meritocracy does not account for the declines in productivity and morale as a result of sexual harassment,"" says the report. ""It can make her question her own scientific worth. Additionally, it can make scientific achievement feel like it is not worth it."" That may partly explain another paradox. ""There are more women in these fields, yet there's still sexual harassment,"" said Elizabeth L. Hillman, a committee member who is president of Mills College and an expert on sexual assault in the military. Billy Williams, a committee member and director of science for the American Geophysical Union, said simply complying with laws like Title IX has not worked because the laws assume women will file formal complaints, when fears of retaliation have made that ""the least common response."" As a result, Dr. Johnson said, universities should establish less formal ways for women to report their experiences. The report did not evaluate investigative processes, imposing discipline or the rights of accused harassers, except to say that procedures and consequences should be fair to all sides. The panel said institutions should adopt training programs that focus on changing behavior, not beliefs. The programs should be evaluated for effectiveness and ""not be based on the avoidance of legal liability."" When institutions survey people about their experiences with sexual harassment, they should use validated questionnaires and ""avoid specifically using the term 'sexual harassment'"" in the questions. In recent years, the University of Texas system has been taking many of the steps the report recommended, said Wanda Mercer, associate vice chancellor for student affairs, including making survey data public and providing more informal ways to report harassment allegations. But, she cautioned, ""I think it's very difficult to change the climate. I think that's a hard thing to do because higher education has been around a long time and those power structures are in place, the people are in place.""","Current policies and programs have failed overwhelmingly to address and prevent the problem, said a report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.",42157076-0199-5f8a-b308-ba15f7a42724,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/science/13HARASSMENT-1-print/13HARASSMENT-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=d5879eccc87f44c95f99f8f8b504ab5f8f1b284541c6a0f767029513136a68ac&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The report cited a survey by the University of Texas system, which found that 20 percent of female science students, 25 percent of female engineering students and 40 percent of female medical students experienced sexual harassment from faculty or staff.",42157076-0199-5f8a-b308-ba15f7a42724,Demo_data/D1_img2/142157076-0199-5f8a-b308-ba15f7a42724.jpg,2
Books,How Langston Hughes Brought His Radical Vision to the Novel,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/books/review/angela-flournoy-langston-hughes-not-without-laughter.html,"For a writer like , who made a name for himself as a poet before the age of 21, his debut novel, ""Not Without Laughter,"" feels like an effort to stake out a bigger claim on his abilities, to create artistic and thematic breathing room. Arna Bontemps, celebrated poet and friend to Hughes, described ""Not Without Laughter"" as the novel that both Hughes and his readers knew he had to write, coming as it did on the heels of Hughes's two well-received poetry collections, ""The Weary Blues"" (1926) and ""Fine Clothes to the Jew"" (1927). Hughes published these collections while a student at Lincoln University, and he released ""Not Without Laughter"" in 1930, shortly after graduating. ""By the date of his first book of prose Hughes had become for many a symbol of the black renaissance,"" Bontemps writes. The stakes were high, then, for the young man born in Joplin, Mo. He had to deliver. ""Not Without Laughter"" crystallizes some of the themes introduced in Hughes's first two poetry collections and examines in detail subjects he would return to throughout his decades-long career, among them the experiences of working-class and poor blacks, the importance of black music to black life, the beauty of black language and the trap of respectability. It begins as a tale of family life, following the Williamses -- the matriarch, Aunt Hager; her daughters, Harriet, Annjee (Annjelica) and Tempy; and Annjee's husband, Jimboy -- in the small Kansas town of Stanton. After establishing the conflicts and desires of the adults, the narrative becomes a bildungsroman. Here it finds its true purpose: chronicling the upbringing of Sandy, the son of Jimboy and Annjee, as he struggles to forge an identity outside of the boxes the white and black worlds have put him in, and tries to find stability within his increasingly unstable home. Each family member provides an example of how Sandy might navigate his world. Sandy's father is a blues man, a guitar picker with an itch for traveling, who leaves his wife and his son for months on end. Sandy's mother works long hours as a domestic for an exacting white woman and comes home so exhausted and lovesick that she doesn't have much attention to spare for her young son. Soon enough she leaves Stanton for good, determined to stay by Jimboy's side and find happiness in their reunion. Aunt Hager is Sandy's primary caretaker, and it is her grandson in whom she invests all her hopes for her family line: ""I's gwine raise one chile right yet, if de Lawd lets me live -- just one chile right!"" In an unkind light Hager can be read as a Mammy, a former slave who chose to stay by her mistress's side for several years after emancipation rather than ""scatter like buckshot,"" as most freed people did, and who now washes the clothes of white people and tends to their illnesses when called. Hughes takes care to flesh out Hager's motivations, which prove to be more complicated than unblinking servitude. Hager finds sanity and solace in forgiveness, in assuming the best in people who are too ignorant to reciprocate that courtesy. Her benevolence is her own existential armor. Hate ""closes up de sweet door to life an' makes ever'thing small an' mean an' dirty,"" Hager insists. Her beliefs stand in stark contrast to those of many other negroes, including her own children.

Hager's youngest daughter, Harriet, is beautiful, and has a voice made to sing the blues. She gives her mother and Annjee's way of life a chance -- working at a country club where old white men make passes at her -- but ultimately opts out, hoping to escape Stanton altogether. She runs away with the carnival,then returns to town and dabbles in sex work before finally getting a break as a singer. Her story begins as one of classic teenage rebellion but ends as an example of fierce determination. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

In his famous essay ""The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain,"" Hughes expresses fondness for ""the low-down folks, the so-called common element."" Poor African-Americans made up a majority of the black population but were rarely depicted as fully realized characters in the serious literature of the day. ""They furnish a wealth of colorful, distinctive material for any artist because they still hold their own individuality in the face of American standardizations,"" Hughes writes. A writer who extols the virtues of a group of people based on any demographic denominator runs the risk of flattening or essentializing his characters, but in the face of popular novels centered on middle- and upper-class black experiences, such as those by his contemporary Jessie Redmon Fauset, Hughes's call for nuanced consideration of working-class (and even out-of-work) black people was noteworthy. The early decades of the 20th century were also a period when ""color mania"" was part of day-to-day black social and professional life, with lighter skin seen as correlating with increased romantic prospects and more opportunities for upward mobility. Hughes's focus on main characters with darker skin tones -- something we are reminded of throughout the novel -- seems like a conscious statement against racial assimilation and conformity. In reviewing Hughes's first autobiography, ""The Big Sea"" (1940), Richard Wright recalls Hughes's first two poetry collections being greeted with shock by the black reading public. ""Since then the realistic position assumed by Hughes has become the dominant outlook of all those Negro writers who have something to say,"" Wright observes. Indeed what stays with the reader longer than the overall narrative arc of ""Not Without Laughter"" is the frequent, unexpected uses of imagery and language that make the characters and their lives feel real. Sandy recalls Aunt Hager, a woman who frowns on secular dancing -- even if that dancing takes place in her own yard -- whirling round and round at a revival in religious ecstasy. With the same amount of fondness he recalls his aunt Harriet ""balling-the-jack"" to Jimboy's guitar music in the yard. Both Aunt Hager and Sister Johnson tend to pronounce the word ""idea"" as ""idee,"" a subtle nod to what the historian Henry Louis Gates Jr. calls ""the linguistic legacy of slavery."" During conversations between black characters, the word ""nigger"" rolls off their tongues often -- sometimes pejoratively, sometimes humorously, but more often as a general descriptor -- and it's a testament to Hughes's ear for black language that we are never in doubt about the intended tone. This focus on rendering realistically how black folks behave among themselves, whether or not such behavior would be considered proper in other contexts, is one of the novel's greatest achievements. Like his one-time collaborator and contemporary Zora Neale Hurston, Hughes takes an anthropological approach to setting and character development. The town of Stanton where ""Not Without Laughter"" is set is similar to Lawrence, the small Kansas town where Hughes grew up with his maternal grandmother while his father worked in Mexico and his mother lived in Topeka. It was the sort of place where blacks and whites might live in close proximity to one another, but where a black boy would avoid walking by his white neighbor's front lawn for fear of having insults and slurs -- or worse -- hurled at him. Like the novel's hero, Sandy, Hughes grew up with a largely absent father and an interest in books. Already a budding public figure by the time of the novel's release, Hughes likely saw his own life pulling him farther and farther away from the small-town Midwestern world that raised him. Reading ""Not Without Laughter,"" one can't help feeling as if Hughes had a desperate need to get all of his early cultural memories down on paper, from the ""sooty gray-green light"" that turns to blackness before a tornado touches down, to the possum, peach preserves and yams that make up a humble Thanksgiving dinner.

Sandy is an ideal protagonist for a novel so interested in place and culture -- an observant boy with a penchant for finding the extraordinary in the ordinary. He listens intently during warm nights spent on the porch with Aunt Hager, with an occasional visit from Sister Johnson or the speechifying Madam de Carter. He overhears grown black folks parsing out the psychology of whites who want to keep blacks close to them -- nursing their children, preparing their meals -- but always beneath them, and withholds his own judgment, already wise enough to know he doesn't yet know enough. As a teenager Sandy sweeps up at a neighborhood barbershop, a place ""filled with loud man-talk and smoke and laughter,"" and gets a crude sexual education from the conversations of the shop's day laborer customers and barbers, as well as plenty of lessons in playing the dozens -- ""the protective art of turning back a joke."" He inhabits this new space the same way he inhabits every other one, simultaneously attuned to its peculiarities and somewhat set apart. In ""The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain,"" Hughes addresses the issue of respectability, the belief that promoting only the best, brightest and most palatable forms of blackness might somehow temper white bigotry. ""'Oh, be respectable, write about nice people, show how good we are,' say the Negroes,"" he laments. The respectability argument is so attractive to some that nearly eight decades later it still rears its head with regard to black art and representation. For Sandy, the pressure to be respectable comes from Aunt Tempy, Aunt Hager's oldest child, who avoids visiting her washerwoman mother in an effort to preserve the illusion of her middle-class upbringing. After Hager's death, Sandy moves in with Tempy, and with his usual levelheadedness is able to see the futility of her and her husband's way of thinking: They look down on the Baptist church for its ""nigger music"" but are still made to use the servant's entrance at some of the town's finer white establishments. Sandy is nobody's fool, though: He sees the benefits their lifestyle affords him, like his own room and the freedom to read as much as he wants. ""Not Without Laughter"" is an early Great Migration novel. Many blacks in Kansas arrived from the South after emancipation, and with the advent of automation and the decline of agricultural work, blacks kept traveling north and west in search of opportunities. A migration narrative is necessarily a story of change. The author's task is to replicate the nostalgia and hope his characters feel as they set out for new futures, or the fear, resentment and loneliness of those left behind. Jimboy, the novel's most frequent migrant, sings a song that encapsulates both sides of the experience: I got a mule to ride. I got a mule to ride. Down in the South somewhere. I got a mule to ride. O, don't you leave me here. Babe, don't you leave me here. Dog-gone yo' comin' back! Said don't you leave me here. As a depiction of a period of transition, the migration novel often makes a priority of capturing life as it is led in its very moment, since there's no telling what might change when characters find themselves in new landscapes. The changing way of life between one generation and the next is a persistent point of tension in ""Not Without Laughter."" Aunt Hager pumps water for her laundry washing, as well as for the cooking and cleaning, yet a few miles away Tempy lives with electric lights and indoor plumbing. Hager sees hotels as breeding grounds for vice and sin, but both Harriet and Sandy jump at the chance to work at one, motivated by a paycheck. Hughes uses the songs and dances of Jimboy and Harriet as well as the church revival culture of Hager and Annjee -- in scenes taking place on the same night, less than a half mile apart -- to depict the crossroads between the traditions that have given expression to the community in the past and those that might fill that role in the future. Sandy's father, Jimboy, is caught in a cycle of desiring to be on the road to find better work (and freedom from responsibility) and of nostalgia for the culture and familiarity of the South. Jimboy's wanderlust is offensive to Hager, but Sandy idolizes his father, begging him to teach him how to box and fish and play guitar. The scene of Jimboy about to cut out for the road once again -- this time for good -- is one of the most poignant in the book. Sandy discovers his father ""sitting dejectedly on the well-stoop in the sunshine, with his head in his hands,"" his posture conveying the sort of defeat only a man intending to abandon his family feels. The father takes his son in his arms and kisses him awkwardly. He does not say goodbye. Later that afternoon Sandy discovers Jimboy has left town. What prevents Hughes's characters from being mere archetypes of working-class black folks, or of the Great Migration, is their ability to change and respond to one another. ""Not Without Laughter"" is a novel not without forgiveness. Its characters ultimately prize family over their own ideological resolve, though it takes some longer than others to get there. After hearing news of Harriet's arrest for streetwalking, Hager doesn't speak her daughter's name for some time, but she does not disown her; Hager's dying wish is for Harriet to be happy. Even Tempy's taking in of Sandy can be seen as an attempt to pull her family close again after keeping her distance for so long. The one exception is Jimboy, who remains elusive throughout the novel, a father figure always out of reach. A poet who writes fiction can imbue his prose with a considerable amount of magic. For Hughes, his magic is an appreciation for the lyrics and rhythms of jazz and blues. It's one thing to appreciate the cultural aspects of these musical forms, yet another to home in on the lyrics, the power of the repetition employed therein, the subtle turns of phrase and uses of wit.

""Not Without Laughter"" includes lyrics to songs that are mournful, bawdy, vengeful and downright silly. They underscore the importance Hughes felt they played in black life and consciousness. One gets the sense that Sandy's upbringing has been shaped just as much by overhearing these songs as by Aunt Hager's teachings. As the novel progresses, Sandy's thoughts are rendered in musical streams of consciousness, quickly turning from anticipation to curiosity to anger to desire. The result is a realistic portrayal of the rhythms of a young man's inner life: Sandy lies in bed at night and riffs on his own past and future. In perhaps the most peculiar scene of the novel, Sandy is pursued by a solicitous older man, a ""yellow man with a womanish kind of voice,"" on the streets of Chicago. Sandy quickly ascertains that the man is one of the ""queer fellows"" who try to convince boys to come up to their rooms. The scene ends with Sandy running away, but Hughes writes that Sandy wondered what such men did with the boys they seduced. ""Curious, he'd like to find out -- but he was afraid."" For the time period, to acknowledge homosexual activity, and to allow that it might pique one's interest, was quite rare. The scene would remain one of Hughes's more direct engagements with the topic of homosexuality in his prose until the 1961 short story ""Blessed Assurance."" The tragedy and senselessness of racism is felt throughout ""Not Without Laughter,"" and Hughes takes care to show how it manifests itself in ways small and large. Sandy cries after he overhears Annjee's boss, Mrs. Rice, berate his mother as she packs up leftovers for him. When Sandy and his friends are turned away from the Children's Day Party at the theme park, the other kids talk loudly about the injustice of it, and Sandy just keeps muttering, ""I suppose they didn't mean colored kids,"" a feeble attempt to make sense of a surprising and hurtful situation. His friend Buster plans to pass as white and tells the gang that if one day they should run into him in a big city, to act like they don't know him. Colorism seeps down to every aspect of life, even those moments made for pleasure, as at Benbow's dance: ""'High yallers, draw nigh! Brown-skins, come near!' somebody squalled. 'But black gals, stay where you are!'"" Hughes would not write another novel for nearly 30 years, until 1958, but four years after the publication of ""Not Without Laughter"" he released the story collection ""The Ways of White Folks,"" a series of vignettes about the interaction between white and black people, often with grim, moralistic endings. By this time he had parted ways with his white benefactor Charlotte Mason; his resentment over the split might explain why these stories reach for concrete conclusions that do not similarly burden his novel. ""Not Without Laughter"" is a debut in the best of ways: It covers uncharted territory, it compels its readers to see part of the world anew, and it prizes exploration over pat conclusion. Hughes accesses the universal -- how all of us love and dream and laugh and cry -- by staying faithful to the particulars of his characters and their way of life. With this book the young poet from Joplin, Mo., manages to deliver something more valuable than simply an admirable debut -- he gives his readers and contemporaries a guide for careful consideration of the lives of everyday black people. Such a guide is still useful to readers and writers today. Perhaps now more than ever.","Poor black lives weren't depicted in the serious fiction of Hughes's day.

Theater,How Much Does a Play Change During Previews? Just Ask 'The Perplexed',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/theater/the-perplexed-previews.html,"How Much Does a Play Change During Previews? Just Ask 'The Perplexed'

The final sound cue for ""The Perplexed,"" Richard Greenberg's new comedy about two estranged, wealthy families brought together by their children's impending nuptials, is offstage laughter. Heralding the arrival of long-awaited guests, it's supposed to be jubilant. Instead, at the first preview of the show last month at New York City Center, the laugh track rang like a witch's cackle. ""It felt too sardonic to me,"" Lynne Meadow, the longtime artistic director of Manhattan Theater Club who's helming the production, said afterward. It took at least seven more tries to finally capture the ideal sound effect. Now it was just a matter of solidifying dozens of other decisions before the play's official premiere on Tuesday.

Previews are a unique, enduring feature of the theater world: Kicking off a show's run, they are a period of public performances before opening night, which can last anywhere from several days to, in the notorious case of 2011's ""Spider Man: Turn Off the Dark,"" 180-some performances. (More recently, previews for ""West Side Story"" were extended by two weeks while Isaac Powell, who plays Tony, recovered from a knee injury.) As such, previews are as much a part of a play's creative process as its closed rehearsals.

While the intimacy of a studio is a safe space for experimentation and development, only once an audience of strangers enters the theater can a director, playwright and actors know for sure what's landing and what's falling flat. Changes to dialogue, costumes, lighting cues come daily until the show is ""frozen,"" when the script and blocking are set. Critics are then invited to previews, and their reviews are traditionally published opening night. The process can result in a whole character sent packing, an intermission axed or pages of script inserted, only to be chucked out days later. Rehearsals can often be called during previews, which means a cast could go over new lines at a morning practice, only to perform an old script that night.

Nothing so extreme was required for ""The Perplexed."" Still, over the course of three weeks and 23 previews, monologues were scrapped, blocking was restaged, 50-cent words were replaced with accessible synonyms and a final bow featuring the actors holding champagne glasses was tried once -- then promptly trashed. ""For me, it's all about figuring out what people are getting,"" said Greenberg, whose Tony Award-winning play ""Take Me Out"" is being revived by Second Stage Theater in April. ""Until you get into rehearsal, you're talking to yourself,"" he explained. In the studio with a director and actors, a playwright has the benefit of clarifying his intentions, but all that changes in previews. ""Then you get in front of a bunch of strangers, and you can hear when something is mystifying."" Greenberg is as versed in the city's educated, upper-middle class as a sommelier who knows his wine list, its undertones, its hints and everything else that gives nuance. His most recent works, ""Our Mother's Brief Affair"" (2016) and the Tony-nominated ""The Assembled Parties"" (2013), were both directed by Meadow. ""The Perplexed"" is a drawing-room play, literally -- it is set in a lavish home library of an unseen, Jewish billionaire host, Berland Stahl -- and figuratively. Like some characters from Greenberg's previous works, the members of the wedding party here belong to a privileged, insular world, yet feel adrift amid changing cultural tides. While the countdown to a midnight ceremony ticks on, they hash out drama old and new. We meet the bride (Tess Frazer) and her parents, City Councilwoman Evy Arlen-Stahl (Margaret Colin) and Joseph Stahl (Frank Wood), who is the billionaire's disinherited son. Evy goes way back, both in business and pleasure, with the lawyer Ted Resnik (Gregg Edelman), the father of the groom (JD Taylor). Ted's self-righteous, do-gooder wife is Natalie Hochberg-Resnik (Ilana Levine). Also in the mix are Evy's son, Micah (Zane Pais), a medical student who stars in gay adult films on the side; her writer brother (Patrick Breen); a former rabbi from South Carolina (Eric William Morris) dealing with some meshugas of his own; and one working-class character, Berland's Guyanese aide Patricia Persaud (Anna Itty).

""The Perplexed"" is a social-issue casserole, a tumble of ingredients culled from the zeitgeist -- porn, feminism, 1 percent-level wealth -- that could each warrant its own entree. Instead, they are tossed into a single Pyrex to roast among the other flavors; audiences will decide whether this style is adept or clumsy. ""This is a play that has political references and issues about morality and your politics and your reaction to change,"" says Meadow. ""But this is not a piece of agitprop."" In an explosive Act II scene, Evy finds herself alone with Ted for the first time in 20 years. She expresses fear that her son's extracurricular activities have put her campaign for City Council Speaker in jeopardy. And they needle her sense of irrelevance now that her breed of progressive Jewish female is no longer as revolutionary as it once was. In the first preview, she explains to Ted, ""Pornography, statistics tell us, is used by an overwhelming majority of the adult population, and to consider yourself superior to an enterprise people of your ilk enjoy is the grossest hypocrisy, and to approve of its existence as I, with significant reservations, do, while stipulating that it be the work of other people's children, is of course, insupportable."" By the end of the first week of previews, that monologue was gone, leaving an extended tender silence in its place. ""Now it's an emotional moment,"" Colin said. ""It's not the conflict of her politics."" For all script changes, no matter how minute, Greenberg gets the final say. Even something as seemingly imperceptible as adding ""then"" to combine two sentences into one warranted a conversation. ""For us, the opinion of the playwright is god,"" said Meadow during the February 21 rehearsal. ""We don't run cuts or changes that the playwright doesn't want to do.""","Tweaks to dialogue, costumes and lighting cues came daily, as the cast and crew of Richard Greenberg's new play prepared for opening night.",0cdb9470-6113-58a4-b26f-76b9e1b21dd8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/03/arts/28previews-perplexed-1/28previews-perplexed-1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=fa3176714bdefd58dd0ec19a810d097a8b739a98983aaf8d87d72036dc357cf5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Onstage, the cast of ""The Perplexed,"" with the director, Lynne Meadow, at right, during a rehearsal this month.",0cdb9470-6113-58a4-b26f-76b9e1b21dd8,Demo_data/D1_img2/10cdb9470-6113-58a4-b26f-76b9e1b21dd8.jpg,10
Books,How Rose Dugdale Went From British Debutante to I.R.A. 'Freedom Fighter',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/books/review/the-woman-who-stole-vermeer-anthony-m-amore.html,"THE WOMAN WHO STOLE VERMEER 

The True Story of Rose Dugdale and the Russborough House Art Heist 

By Anthony M. Amore Rick Perlstein once described the end of the 1960s counterculture as ""a blaze of numbskull adventurism and Maoist masquerade"" that flickered out by 1970. It seems no one told Rose Dugdale, the star of Anthony M. Amore's ""The Woman Who Stole Vermeer,"" who in 1974 elevated numbskull Maoist adventurism to an art form -- literally -- by making off with the Dutch master's painting ""Lady Writing a Letter With Her Maid"" from Russborough House, the Palladian showcase of Sir Alfred and Lady Beit just south of Dublin. Before her political awakening, notoriety and subsequent imprisonment, Dugdale was an upper-class London debutante. Born in March 1941, she was ""tucked safely away"" at her father's country estate during the German air raids, ""a Blitz baby only by date, not by experience."" Her childhood in East Devon was spent, according to friends and family, in ""a farmhouse smartened up to the extent of being 'ludicrously overdone,'"" riding horses, being ""jolly smartly dressed"" and giggling. Rose was devoted to her ""smart, handsome, lean and athletic"" father, Colonel Dugdale. Amore -- the head of security at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum -- relates the likely apocryphal tale of the colonel having his teeth knocked out while playing polo, dismounting, shoving them back into place -- where they ""stayed put for several more years"" -- and carrying on. Rose was educated at Miss Ironside's in South Kensington -- Jane Birkin would be its most famous alumna -- with, in her words, ""the daughters of aristocracy ... learning to curtsy, and worrying not about exams, 'for Mr. Right was bound to come along eventually.'"" Headmistress Virginia Ironside remembered, ""Everyone adored this generous, clever and dashing millionaire's daughter, who was life and laughter."" As Amore notes, ""It was high praise from a woman who taught countless young women gifted with Dugdale-like stock."" After graduation, she did the society lady's grand tour.

She came out in the 1958 season, the last year girls were presented to the queen, owing to the diminishing ""class"" of participants. (Princess Margaret put it less delicately: ""We had to put a stop to it. Every tart in London was getting in."") Rose found the spectacle ""a torture"" but submitted so that her parents would allow her to study politics, philosophy and economics at St. Anne's College, Oxford. ""It was the last time,"" Amore observes, ""she would do anything at her parents' command for the rest of her life."" Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books?

At Oxford, Dugdale was at first ""extremely right-wing,"" defending the House of Lords and the class system and collecting student clubs. Her rebellions were unimaginative -- she wore men's clothes, smoked incessantly and seldom cleaned her room. Rose's own recollection is characteristically disarming: ""I turned into the most disagreeable kind of intellectual, badly dressed and extremely arrogant."" She took an ""unimpressive"" third-class degree and went on to Mount Holyoke in Massachusetts for graduate work in philosophy. The novelist Iris Murdoch, who taught her at Oxford, predicted moderate establishment success for Rose, as perhaps ""an able administrator or a good university teacher."" Rose had different ideas.  An aborted lectureship at Bedford College, two years in the Ministry of Overseas Development and the revolutionary atmosphere of 1968 combined to transform Rose ""from academic to activist."" She railed against the Vietnam War, the iniquities of capitalism and, above all, the English yoke in Ireland. Bloody Sunday -- the massacre of 13 Irish Republican protesters in January 1972 -- drew Rose to domestic terrorism. As Amore illustrates with an irresistible blend of wryness and affection, her adopted proletarian role was not always convincing or particularly noble. Rose continued to attend operas and horse races, supported by an allowance from her father. Her conversation was peppered with ""old left-wing jargon like something out of an old pamphlet from the Fabians."" And her affair with the socialist Wally Heaton was carried out in plain view of his beleaguered wife and daughters. Whether out of ""guilt, restitution or both,"" Rose gave Mrs. Heaton 25,000 British pounds during the relationship.

The road to Russborough was paved with misadventure. Amore's winning detachment is unchanged as Rose evolves from debutante to desperado. She tried to enlist Wally's cousin-in-law, an associate of East London's infamous Kray brothers, to orchestrate criminal activities in aid of the I.R.A., but he balked at the prospect of committing treason and turned police informant. In June 1973, Rose and Wally burglarized her family's estate while they were out at the Epsom Derby, depositing the valuables at the flat of a former tutor. At the open-and-shut trial, she made feeble denials while proclaiming herself ""a freedom fighter""; frequently kissed Wally in the dock; and disparaged her put-upon parents as ""gangsters, thieves and oppressors of the poor."" Wally was sentenced to six years in prison, while Rose's two-year suspended sentence was delivered with sexist condescension and what Amore calls ""a legendary display of poor character evaluation."" The judge was, to be sure, wildly off the mark: ""I think the risk that you will ever again commit burglary or any dishonesty is extremely remote."" Within the year, Dugdale was dropping bombs on the police station at the Irish town of Strabane. In keeping with the element of farce, the explosives failed to detonate, but still she declared the fiasco ""operationally very important and exciting."" A local official enjoyed witnessing his ""enemy making a fool of himself."" Undaunted, Dugdale shifted her sights to Russborough House and its famous -- and poorly guarded -- collection of pictures assembled by the South African diamond magnate Sir Alfred Beit and his brother, Otto. Alfred's nephew (and namesake) and his wife were at home on the night of April 26, 1974. Dugdale, her new boyfriend and two accomplices bound, gagged and insulted the Beits (""capitalist pig"" was the disappointing extent of it) and swiped 19 important paintings by Gainsborough, Goya, Rubens, Velazquez, Vermeer -- to whom fewer than 40 works are fully attributed today -- and others from their frames. The estimated PS8 million haul was recovered upon Rose's capture 10 days later. For her first three days in captivity, Rose refused to confirm her identity or remove her brunette wig. The I.R.A. disavowed the robbery. The ensuing trial concluded with Rose's solemn, semi-coherent peroration and the jury's near-immediate verdict. This time, she got nine years in prison. Amore's publisher has falsely advertised his droll, engaging book as an ""unbelievable"" heist story. ""Ocean's 8"" (or 11, 12, 13) it's not, Dugdale is more Fawlty than Ocean. Yet this in no way diminishes the pleasures of ""The Woman Who Stole Vermeer."" Rose is terrific company: clever, forthright and flamboyant. (During her incarceration, she wed, gave birth and petitioned for the construction of squash facilities.) She is still alive today -- though she did not grant Amore an interview -- and is now praised by the former Irish republicans. Her Facebook profile photo is the Russborough Vermeer. And Rose's legacy? The historian David Farber has suggested that ""the '60s generation of activists saw themselves as acting in history. 'The Whole World Is Watching' -- they were literally chanting it in the streets. And that's the irony that's heated up this debate so much. Because in the end, well, maybe they weren't the historical agents of change quite as much as they hoped."" One imagines Rose's unprintable reply.","In ""The Woman Who Stole Vermeer,"" Anthony M.

Art & Design,"Alan Peckolick, a Leading Logo Designer, Dies at 76",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/09/arts/design/alan-peckolick-died-graphic-designer.html,"Alan Peckolick, who overcame a failed art school career to emerge as a leading designer of some the world's most distinctive logos, died on Aug. 3 in Danbury, Conn. He was 76. The cause was brain damage sustained after a fall, his wife, Jessica Weber, said. He had Parkinson's disease. A protege and partner of the influential graphic designer Herb Lubalin, whose acolytes also included the art director George Lois and the photographer Art Kane, Mr. Peckolick was a virtuoso man of letters. His typography distinguished familiar logos, like GM's (just the two initials underscored by a muscular solid bar), and the typefaces for company names, including Pfizer, Revlon and Mercedes-Benz, and institutions like New York University and the City College of New York.

""Basically, for me, if a word was a beautiful word, it wasn't the sound of the word that intrigued me but the look of the word,"" Mr. Peckolick (pronounced PECK-oh-lick) told The Huffington Post in 2015. ""I saw each letterform as a piece of design. Cat is not 'cat' -- it's c-a-t. That's what led to the beginning of the expressive topography."" Seymour Chwast, a fellow designer and illustrator, said in an email that Mr. Peckolick ""was totally dedicated to design, its history, its function and what it might offer in the future.""  Eventually fed up with being a rainmaker for the advertising agencies he worked for, diverting his creative his energies to courting clients, Mr. Peckolick took up painting. As an artist, he was captivated by weathered billboards and their faded evocations of a vanishing cityscape.

""Signage has been covered so often by photography that as a subject it is a commonplace,"" Grace Glueck of The New York Times wrote in reviewing an exhibition of his work at a SoHo gallery in 2002, ""but Mr. Peckolick, good at the colors and textures of erosion, nicely captures the sense of time past that gives these brief messages their nostalgic appeal."" Alan Jay Peckolick was born on Oct. 3, 1940, in the Bronx to Charles Peckolick, a letter carrier (actual letters, not the kind his son would work with) and the former Belle Binenbaum. ""I never knew anything about design or graphics or any of those fancy words,"" Mr. Peckolick recalled in 2015. ""But I used to draw. I used to draw everything. When my mother used to send me out to get groceries, by the time I was back there were little drawings on the grocery bags."" He graduated from Elmont Memorial High School on Long Island, just across the Queens border, after which, he said: ""My mother put together a portfolio which was made of anything I drew on -- handkerchiefs, scraps, whatever -- and put it literally into a brown paper bag. She sent me out into the world to go to places like Cooper Union and the School of Visual Arts. Both schools, he said, ""immediately saw there was no talent here, and they rejected me."" Pratt Institute in Brooklyn accepted him, in the illustration department. But three months later, he was told to leave because his work was not improving. A schoolmate discovered him in a coffee shop, dejected.

""I explained to him,"" he recalled, ""that I was kicked out of art school because I couldn't draw very well. He said: 'Well that's no problem. Why don't you just become a graphic designer?' I said, 'What's that?' He said, 'Don't worry about what it is, but you don't have to know how to draw!'"" Mr. Peckolick graduated from Pratt in 1964 and opened his own office. In 1972 he joined Lubalin, Smith & Carnase (the firm later became Pushpin Lubalin Peckolick Associates). Through his mentor, Mr. Lubalin, Mr. Peckolick recalled, ""I discovered other people like Saul Bass, Lou Dorfsman, George Lois -- people who could think as well as design.""

""Then,"" he added, ""I was in the lap of luxury; I could steal from the best."" He and Ms. Weber, who is also a graphic designer, lived in Manhattan and Sherman, Conn. In addition to her, he is survived by his brother, Paul, and his sister, Gael Rae-Garwood. Mr. Peckolick was the author of several books, including ""Teaching Type to Talk"" (2013), and illustrated a number of others. Despite his growing fame for defining corporate identities and designing annual reports, book jackets and posters, his longevity at advertising agencies mirrored his art school experience.","GM, Revlon and Mercedes-Benz were just some of Mr. Peckolick's clients.",ff3181f5-7842-5bad-9e1b-94fb346af741,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/09/obituaries/09peckolick2/09peckolick2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=b09f545896373ea63294c8ad11297ee308b332f24df6e9eb2484da7e10cef91b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mr. Peckolicks GM logo at the entrance of a GM building in Roswell, Ga.",ff3181f5-7842-5bad-9e1b-94fb346af741,Demo_data/D1_img2/1ff3181f5-7842-5bad-9e1b-94fb346af741.jpg,14

Television,2 Men Detained in Jussie Smollett Case Are Released by Police,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/arts/television/smollett-suspects.html,"The two brothers arrested in connection with the reported attack on the ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett were released without being charged on Friday, a police spokesman said. They are no longer considered potential suspects. ""Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the 'Empire' case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" Anthony Guglielmi, the Chicago Police Department spokesman, said in a statement. That announcement was the latest twist in an investigation that started late last month, when Smollett told the authorities that he had been attacked early one morning by two masked men who yelled homophobic and racial slurs at him in downtown Chicago. Smollett also told the police at the time that the assailants had tied a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance on him. But the two people who were arrested are acquaintances of Smollett, a lawyer for the men said. At least one had appeared on ""Empire,"" a fact that had fueled social media speculation that at least parts of Smollett's story were not true.

The police went from describing the two men as possible suspects for whom there was probable cause to believe they were part of the crime to releasing them, without explanation as to what had changed. In a brief phone interview late Friday night, Guglielmi said Smollett was still being treated as a victim. Since Smollett reported the attack, the Police Department has said several times publicly that it has no reason to doubt his story. A representative for Smollett did not immediately respond late Friday to a request for comment on the latest development. The men were initially detained on Wednesday after arriving on a return flight from Nigeria. Also on Wednesday, the police raided their home and, according to CBS Chicago, removed items like an ""Empire"" script, a phone and a black face mask hat. For weeks, the investigators -- who have treated the case as a possible hate crime -- had few leads. They could not find surveillance footage showing any attack. However, within days of the reported episode, the police released the images of two men who were in the area, whom the police considered ""potential persons of interest."" After ""meticulous investigation with the use of advanced technology, interviews with the victim and witnesses, and transportation records,"" the police said, they discerned the two men's identities and detained them.

Gloria Schmidt, a lawyer for the two men arrested, did not respond to calls and emails requesting comment, but did tell CBS Chicago: ""They're really baffled why they are people of interest. They really don't understand how they even got information that linked them to this horrific crime. But they're not guilty of it. They know that the evidence is going to prove them innocent. They send their best to Jussie."" In an interview broadcast on ""Good Morning America"" on Thursday, Smollett expressed frustration that his story was being doubted. [Read more about Jussie Smollett's interview on ""Good Morning America"" and other developments here.] ""It feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more,"" Smollett told ABC's Robin Roberts. ""A lot more."" He also said he was sure that the men in the surveillance images were the ones who attacked him. ""Because I was there,"" Smollett said. ""For me, when that was released, I was like, 'O.K., we're getting somewhere.' I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them. Never did."" It is unclear whether the Chicago police still believe that the men in those images were the men they arrested this week.",The two brothers who had been arrested by the Chicago police were freed late Friday.

Opinion,There's a Strong Case for Sticking With Bail Reform,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/opinion/sunday/bail-reform-new-york.html,"Ms. Bazelon is a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine. Ms. Rahman is the director of strategy and new initiatives at the Vera Institute of Justice.



Since bail reform began in New York on Jan. 1, opponents have been hard at work to create a backlash against the new law, sometimes wrongly blaming it for the commission of crimes by people they say should have been jailed for earlier offenses, and warning of broad danger to the public. Using this old script, prosecutors and police chiefs are demanding rollbacks as a public opinion survey shows that support for bail reform is falling. Largely untold are the stories of thousands of New Yorkers who have been released without incident, and allowed to return to their families, jobs and communities while charges against them are pending. The law is unusual, compared with those in some other states, and that's one reason it's politically vulnerable. But it has the potential to end mass incarceration as we know it in New York, with an anticipated drop in the jail population statewide of 40 percent. It deserves a chance to prove itself. Before the new law, 21,000 New Yorkers were in jail on any given night around the state. More than 60 percent were being held before trial, primarily because they couldn't afford to pay bail. The new law has already reduced the number to 15,000 by making release before trial automatic for people accused of most misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies, which make up 90 percent of the roughly 400,000 arrests each year. Judges still have the authority in all cases to impose conditions like oversight by a case manager, referrals to treatment or counseling, and in some cases, electronic monitoring. For example, take the case of Tiffany Harris, who was arrested and charged with slapping three Orthodox Jewish women on the street in Brooklyn, released without bail, and then rearrested for hitting someone else. A judge could have ordered mental health counseling after the first incident that might have helped her instead of just letting her go.

Judges can also still set bail on almost all violent felony offenses, any case involving sexual abuse or misconduct, all felony and some misdemeanor domestic violence offenses, and witness intimidation and tampering cases. The most common charges for which release must now be allowed are drug possession, theft and unlicensed driving. The best evidence for the success of bail reform comes from Brooklyn. Prosecutors there stopped demanding bail for almost all misdemeanors in April 2017. Over the next year, the number of people held on bail in Brooklyn declined by 43 percent, and Brooklyn has also experienced a decline in crime, with fewer shootings and the lowest number of murders in the borough's history in 2019, according to the district attorney's office.

In 2019, the Bronx and Manhattan followed Brooklyn's lead with similar results. The real impact of bail reform is being felt in upstate New York, where 60 percent of the people in jail are charged with misdemeanors. Already, there have been major drops in the number of people in jail in counties like Herkimer and Onondaga, with no upticks in crime. Despite those facts, bail reform is in political trouble mainly because the state is the only one in the country that bars a judge who is deciding if bail is warranted from considering whether a person poses a threat to public safety. For decades, New York judges have been allowed to consider only the likelihood that the defendant will appear for future court dates (though it is likely that at least some judges factor in public safety in their calculus).

When bail reform was debated last year, the New York State Legislature considered adding a public-safety provision for a small subset of serious cases. But many proponents of reform, especially defense lawyers, feared such a provision would give judges too much leeway to impose preventive detention. The Legislature and Gov. Andrew Cuomo instead struck a compromise that left money bail as an option for almost all violent crimes, the same small subset of serious cases for which a public-safety provision was considered and rejected. Now the governor is mostly defending bail reform, but he also called it an ""ongoing process"" in his budget address Tuesday. If New York decides to tweak its law, it should do so based on months, not weeks, of data. Any amendments should safeguard the principle that the state cannot have two systems of justice, one for the rich and one for the poor. If the Legislature decides to allow judges to detain people for the sake of public safety, it should also eliminate money bail entirely, so that wealthy people aren't released while others facing the same charges are jailed. And a public-safety provision should apply only to serious offenses, and require a hearing with facts showing that the person is likely to threaten someone else's physical safety. The results of bail reform in New Jersey show the benefits of staying the course. In 2017, New Jersey courts essentially stopped imposing cash bail for all criminal charges. Early on, opponents said things like, ""Nobody's afraid to commit crimes anymore,"" and one mother sued the state after her son was killed, allegedly by a man who had been released on a gun possession charge. The New Jersey Supreme Court made it easier to detain people accused of gun crimes or repeat offenses, but otherwise, the state weathered the criticism. In 2017, according to state data, less than 3 percent of people released before trial were rearrested for a serious violent felony or for gun possession. On any given day in 2018, 6,000 fewer people were in jail than had been six years earlier. At the same time, violent crime in New Jersey continued to fall. The experience of other states also shows the value of another element of New York's new law: reducing the time that prosecutors have to turn over evidence in their possession to the defense. New York's so-called blindfold law had allowed prosecutors to withhold key evidence until the morning of trial, and had contributed to wrongful convictions, according to the state bar association. North Carolina and Texas enacted laws in the last decade requiring broad disclosure of evidence, known as discovery. At first, prosecutors said the requirements were unworkable and put witnesses and victims at risk by potentially disclosing their identities. But judges in those states -- and in New York -- can limit disclosure when necessary. Over time, the laws in North Carolina and Texas proved their worth. A 2016 study of North Carolina's law found that 91 percent of prosecutors reported the law was working well. Texas prosecutors have urged New York to view their state as a model for discovery practices. Studies show that it takes only two or three days behind bars to increase the risk that someone charged with a minor, nonviolent crime will be arrested again. It may seem counterintuitive, but jailing people leads to less, not more, public safety. Jail destabilizes people who may already be struggling to pay the rent or get to work. Fear-mongering makes for spicy headlines but terrible policy. New Yorkers should not give in to it.

Style,Does This Red Cap Make Me Look MAGA?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/20/style/red-baseball-hats-maga.html,"Justin Peterson , a 37-year-old graphic designer who lives in Orlando, Fla., owns nearly 100 baseball caps, including several featuring the familiar ""C"" logo of the Cincinnati Reds. But when he and his wife visited her family in Cincinnati over the recent Independence Day holiday weekend, Mr. Peterson didn't bring his red Reds cap. Instead, he opted for the team's alternate black hat. ""Unfortunately, I don't feel comfortable wearing red baseball hats anymore,"" Mr. Peterson said. ""I don't want someone assuming I'm something that I'm not, or that I represent something that I think has become pretty ugly."" There are plenty of people who are proud to wear President Trump's signature ""Make America Great Again"" caps, of course, as evinced at recent rallies. When Mr. Trump's campaign introduced them in 2015, he was dubbed a ""marketing genius."" Hats flew off the shelves in the store at the Trump Tower in Midtown as Republican supporters and Democrats alike vied to obtain the accessory of the summer.

Put more simply, they fear being mistaken for MAGA. Since teams throughout the sports world produce baseball-style caps for sale, the potential for MAGA confusion extends beyond baseball teams like the Philadelphia Phillies and St. Louis Cardinals, and includes fans of the Kansas City Chiefs (a football team), the New Jersey Devils (hockey), Liverpool F.C. (soccer) and many other red-themed teams. It appears to be the latest example of how Mr. Trump's presence tends to have a polarizing effect on almost anything it touches, even something as seemingly innocuous as the humble ball cap. Promotional caps have also been affected. People responding to a reporter's inquiry said they had stopped wearing red caps advertising things like Maker's Mark bourbon and Sriracha hot sauce.

On a recent episode of the humorist John Hodgman's podcast, ""Judge John Hodgman,"" a woman asked if her husband should stop wearing his red promotional caps from a software company. Mr. Hodgman's response: ""If you're not a Trump voter, stay away from it. Stay away from anything that might resemble a MAGA hat.""

Louis Orangeo, 27, a procurement analyst in Bloomfield N.J., did vote for Trump in 2016 and is prepared to vote for him again in 2020, although he isn't 100 percent sure. Mr. Orangeo said he bought a MAGA hat after the election, ""mainly to troll people,"" but stopped wearing it because of negative responses. ""I hate having to explain it and defend it,"" he said. ""It always gets a look and a sneer."" He does wear a minor league baseball team's red cap plenty and nobody has ever said anything. But Mr. Peterson, the Orlando graphic designer, decided to mothball his red caps after his wife pointed out the potential for confusion or confrontation. And others have made similar decisions after noticing the responses to their red hats. ""One of my favorite hats is a red University of Wisconsin Badgers hat,"" said Corey Looby, 31, a database manager from Madison, Wis. ""But when I traveled, I would regularly notice glares from people I passed on the street. I don't want to be associated with MAGA, even mistakenly, so I stopped wearing it."" The phenomenon is by no means universal; some red-capped fans said the potential MAGA connection had never occurred to them until a reporter brought it up. ""I don't like engaging in political conversations. I just want to be friends and talk about other topics, not politics,"" said Jason Stygar, 34, an audio engineer in St. Louis. ""But as a lifelong Cardinals fan, I love my red hat -- I'll wear it anywhere and everywhere. It had never even occurred to me, that someone would mistake it for a MAGA hat, and nobody's ever bothered me about it."" And some are wearing red caps in defiance, regardless of politics. ""I am not pro-Trump or anti-Trump, but I do have a Detroit Red Wings hat and get weird looks when I wear it,"" said Nick Landry, 28, project manager for a carpenter subcontractor in Milford, Mich. ""I continue to wear it as a social experiment, hoping people will feel like idiots when they realize that it's not a MAGA hat and that they're feeling vitriol over something so stupid."" Fans and teams alike, though, have long been wary about inadvertent political messaging. In 1954, for example, the Cincinnati Reds changed their official team name to Redlegs, to avoid being associated with the communist scare. (They changed the name back to Reds in 1959.)

And during George W. Bush's presidency, left-leaning Washington Nationals fans often wore caps with the team's secondary ""DC"" logo, rather than the primary ""W"" mark, lest they be viewed as Dubya supporters. But those examples were team specific and localized, while the potential for being mistaken for MAGA appears to have no regional or even international boundaries. That's what Daniel Proulx discovered earlier this year when he wore a red Molson beer cap while pitching in his softball league in the Canadian town of Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. ""The other teams would comment and ask if I was a Trump supporter,"" said Mr. Proulx, 34, an athletic director at a junior high school. ""I had no idea what they meant, but it was a consistent question. After a while, my own teammates started suggesting that I get a different hat. Maybe something blue instead of red."" Whatever one's opinion of Mr. Trump, these stories are a testament to the MAGA hat's success, both as a popular piece of apparel and as a cultural signifier. Because there are plenty of knockoffs, it's hard to calculate how many of the hats have been sold or distributed since they debuted in 2015 (the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment), but they have become sufficiently ubiquitous, at least in some circles, to overshadow all other red ball caps. Aside from wanting to avoid controversy or the potential for mistaken tribal identity, some people who say they have taken their red headgear out of circulation see this choice as a matter of courtesy or even empathy toward immigrants, minorities and other groups that they consider targets of the president's policies.

""It breaks my heart to think I can make someone be on guard and uncomfortable just by wearing a red hat,"" said Jeremiah McBrayer, 42, an information-technology worker from Missouri who shelved his red headwear after seeing some negative responses to it at his local Home Depot. ""It is just sad and unfortunate that this is where we are in our country now."" Has all of this led to a decline in non-MAGA red cap sales? Two leading cap brands -- New Era Cap Company and '47 -- did not respond to requests for comment; neither did Lids, a chain of cap retailers. Another retailer, Dick's Sporting Goods Inc., declined to comment, citing a company policy of not discussing sales figures. But managers at several sportswear shops said red caps have been harder to obtain from distributors lately, and some of them said the scarlet scarcity was directly related to the MAGA connection. ""Three of our vendors specifically mentioned this trend,"" said Benji Boyter, who runs the retail operation at a South Carolina golf and tennis resort. ""One of them mentioned it in the sense of staying away from too many red hats, while the other two casually mentioned something along the lines of 'You've got to be careful with red hats these days.'"" Many of the people eschewing their red caps said they feel conflicted. On the one hand, they are engaged in a form of protest and resistance. But in doing so, they're granting Mr. Trump power over their apparel choices and how they express their support for their favorite teams. ""It's like, he can't take red hats from us, too,"" said Lendsey Thomson , 33, a sports lawyer in Kansas City who has stopped wearing his favorite red ""KC"" cap. ""But, alas, he kind of has.""

At least one fan has decided to reclaim that power. Dave Tarr, a 64-year-old retiree and Arsenal soccer fan in Charleston, S.C., put aside his beloved red Arsenal cap during the 2016 election campaign. ""And then a few months ago,"" he said, ""I just decided that I wouldn't give Trump or his minions the satisfaction of not doing something that I wanted to do."" So Mr. Tarr brought his Arsenal cap out of retirement and began wearing it again. So far, he said, nobody has said anything about it.",Some sports fans don't want to be confused for Trump supporters.,b57b52be-ad49-589b-afa9-89c09d7a4cc6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/21/fashion/00MAGA1/00MAGA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=2fce0cef19f2fd982d4faf492a7f13404de2eb367772148e7018299f0f6e6d7a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Justin Peterson owns almost 100 baseball caps.

Art & Design,"An Artist Unites North and South Korea, Stitch by Stitch",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/arts/design/kyungah-ham-north-korea.html,"SEOUL, South Korea -- Growing up here in the 1970s, Kyungah Ham would occasionally find propaganda leaflets sent from North Korea via helium balloons. Like her classmates, Ms. Ham turned in the leaflets at school, where she was given a reward for doing a small part in South Korea's simmering ideological war with its neighbor. In 2008, when Ms. Ham found another North Korean leaflet -- this one under the gate of her parents' home -- it felt like an alien object, blown in from a different planet. By then, she was a multimedia artist who had come to distrust much of the history she'd been taught, and she knew that South Koreans were sending leaflets of their own over the border. That got her wondering: Could she communicate directly with people who, through a geopolitical tragedy now 65 years old, she is forbidden to contact? It was the birth of what might be the art world's most extraordinary, ongoing collaboration. For a decade, Ms. Ham has been producing designs on her computer that are printed and smuggled into North Korea through intermediaries based in Russia or China. Then a group of anonymous artisans, whom she has never met or spoken to, are paid to convert them into embroideries, using exquisitely fine stitching. With bribes and subterfuge, the works are smuggled back out. Ultimately, they are shown and sold at galleries and exhibitions. The most ambitious pieces are large-scale renderings of luminous, glittering chandeliers, some nearly 12 feet wide and 9 feet high, that from a distance look like photographs set against black backdrops. Get closer, and a filigree of stitches appear. Both chandelier and backdrop have been painstakingly composed of silk thread.

A lot of artists talk about taking risks, but few mean it as literally as Ms. Ham. International sanctions prohibit commerce with the Hermit Kingdom, so at least theoretically, she could face criminal prosecution for these cash-for-work transactions. The potential penalties for her collaborators are far graver. If caught, these residents of the world's most repressive regime could be imprisoned or executed. The dangers facing the North Koreans raise ethical issues that, intended or otherwise, become part of Ms. Ham's art. ""With Kyungah's work, it's difficult to separate the object from the process of making the object,"" said Rosalie Kim, a curator at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, which acquired one of Ms. Ham's embroideries in 2016. ""The risk isn't the point, but the risk emphasizes the consequences of the separation of the peninsula and what is at stake in trying to overcome it.""

Ms. Ham protects the covert network in her employ with a spymaster's care, and would not discuss the size of the lump sums that cover the cost of intermediaries, artisans and bribes. But she hides neither her art nor the basics of her methods. The Embroidery Project, as she calls it, has been part of museum group shows in London, Vienna and Singapore, and wall labels beside each piece succinctly explain how it was made. On first meeting, Ms. Ham seems wildly miscast for the role she has created for herself. She would be the first to admit that she is lousy at coping with stress, now a permanent feature of her life. Once, on a flight to meet an intermediary, she collapsed with a stomach ailment so painful and severe that as soon as she landed, she was put on the next plane back to Seoul and admitted to a hospital.

If her nerves are fragile, other parts are made of steel. During interviews in both Paris and Seoul in recent months, she was adamant and particular about nearly everything. Before dinner at a brasserie, she rejected three different tables offered by a host. (Her final choice, it must be said, was superior to the others.) She issued demands about virtually every aspect of this article, including who would photograph her. And though an introvert by nature, once she overcomes her natural shyness, she is bursting with words.

""If we take it step by step,"" she said with a smile early in our first meeting, preparing to describe her life and work, ""this will take five hours."" As Ms. Ham explained, her chandeliers are a symbol of the foreign powers that divided Korea along the 38th Parallel after three years of fighting the Korean War. (The golden age of those powers passed, she said, which is why these chandeliers are either falling or already on the ground.) The border was largely imposed on the peninsula by non-Koreans; Ms. Ham's favorite word to describe this fact is ""absurd."" As she conceived her embroideries, she was inspired in part by a moment in a documentary about the Mass Games, Pyongyang's socialist-realist extravaganza of tightly choreographed music, dance and gymnastics. The production includes a crowd, thousands of people strong, holding flip books in front their faces with blocks of colors on each page. The pages are turned in uncannily timed unison, a vast human billboard of seamlessly changing words and images. Ms. Ham watched and saw the face of a young boy peeking over his color book. ""He was like a pixel in a digital image,"" she said. ""I wanted to bring this idea to my chandeliers. Behind them are highly skilled embroidery workers, whom you can't see, but they memorialize themselves, stitch by stitch.""

Ms. Ham is not idle while she waits, and the embroideries are just one facet of a varied career. Since earning an M.F.A. from the School of Visual Arts in New York, in 1995, she has been making videos, sculptures, photographs and an assortment of installations. One recurring impulse is to highlight the ways power is abused, and for whatever reason, she is drawn to methods that give her agita. With an installation called ""Museum Display,"" in 2010, theme and practice were combined. She has long been irked by the many Western museums filled with cultural treasures from other countries -- think of the Elgin marbles, originally part of the Parthenon in Greece, which have spent the last 200 years in the British Museum. With wit and irony, Ms. Ham pilloried this tradition by stealing hundreds of mundane objects from museums around the world, including forks, saucers, knives, vases, salt and pepper shakers. She then displayed them in a huge glass case, under lights, labeling each item with the gravity befitting a looted masterpiece. ""Sign, 'These doors are alarmed,' 10cm x 10 cm, the British Museum, 2009,"" reads one. Her other great passion is connecting to strangers, and the Embroidery Project is an expression of that urge. Among the first images she conceived for her artisans were stylized words, rendered in both Korean and English, and set against abstract and colorful designs. One simply read ""I'm sorry,"" in the two languages. ""I wanted to tell these artisans, 'I'm sorry about the situation,'"" she said. ""'I am sorry about what history has done to us.'"" Later, she began what she calls the ""SMS Series in Camouflage,"" in which she weaves faint words, in script, into almost psychedelic oil slicks of color. One of these not-so-secret messages reads ""Big Smile,"" an instruction for performers during the Mass Games. When a gallerist urged her to employ embroiderers in China, arguing it would be far quicker and easier, she felt misunderstood enough to create a new message: ""Are you lonely, too?""

""There are a lot of beautiful things you can buy at Art Basel, and there are a lot of clever conceptual strategies out there,"" said Roger Buergel, the German-born artistic director of the 2012 Busan Biennale, which featured work by Ms. Ham. ""She unites these two poles in a singular way. The pieces themselves are spectacular."" Though she has given interviews in the past, she spent months wavering about whether to speak to The Times. Friends have told her ""Don't get too famous."" Citing fatigue, she stopped answering texted questions a few weeks ago, including one about the summit between President Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore last month. Would a rapprochement change -- or even end -- her project? After a long silence, she sent a text a few day ago that said that if North Korea joined the brotherhood of nations, her work would be reinterpreted in a new political context and, she wrote, ""stay alive in history."" Today, her pieces sell for prices ranging from $25,000 to $300,000 in the Carlier Gebauer Gallery in Berlin and the Kukje Gallery in Seoul. But the largest collection of her work is in her storage facility outside Seoul. During a visit in February, Ms. Ham offered a tour of what is little more than a large and bare room, with embroideries neatly stacked against each other on the floor. Ms. Ham roamed around the space, beaming. She is somewhat ambivalent about parting with her chandeliers, especially if they are just going to hang on someone's wall. Her preference is to lend pieces to exhibitions, or sell them to museums, where the largest possible audience can consider their improbable journey and marvel at their virtuosity. ""I don't tell the galleries about everything I have,"" she said with a grin, ""because they will sell it.""","Through smugglers and bribes, Kyungah Ham employs embroiderers in the Hermit Kingdom to sew her designs, an extraordinary and risky collaboration.",a010c663-6366-5cc0-a665-13fa0548e045,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/29/arts/29HAM1/29HAM1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=5f1566f597bb2113bfe533985d4bd163b3f568d342d9dbe7b3cc35e3c572639b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Kyungah Ham in her storage room in Seoul, South Korea, where she displays the embroidery made by anonymous artisans in North Korea, following her designs.

Opinion,"To Reduce Racial Inequality, Raise the Minimum Wage",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/25/opinion/minimum-wage-race-protests.html,"After a summer of protests over the killing of George Floyd broadened into a wider reckoning on racial injustice, corporate America and the political establishment unleashed a flurry of promises to combat systemic racism. Diversity initiatives have been launched; high-profile companies in several sectors have settled on the advancement of a few people of color in their hierarchies. It's clear that these actions, while positive steps, so far mostly concern an elite stratum. They are no substitute for dismantling structural racism in the economy. Recent American history, however, provides an apt lesson about which public policies are effective at reducing deep-rooted inequalities. Our new research shows that Congress's decision in 1966 to both raise the minimum wage and expand it to workers in previously unprotected industries led to a significant drop in earnings inequality between Black and white Americans -- and explains more than 20 percent of the overall reduction in succeeding years. The findings suggest that raising and expanding the minimum wage could once again reduce the persistent earnings divide between white workers and Black, Hispanic and Native American workers. Though legislation to raise the wage floor would be a universal program in name and application, in practice it would be a remarkably effective tool for racial justice.

[Read more on 27 places that raised their minumum wage to $15 an hour.] As with other major pieces of 20th-century progressive legislation, the cost of gaining Southern Democratic votes in 1938 for the federal minimum wage was a racist compromise: in this case, the exclusion of certain industries because of their high concentrations of Black workers, especially in the South. Though it's a fact that is often skipped over in popular histories, civil rights leaders who organized the famous March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963 demanded an increase in the minimum wage and one that applied to all employment. Modest but meaningful increases were eventually passed, and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1966 also extended coverage to some of the excluded industries: nursing homes, laundries, hotels, restaurants, schools, hospitals and agriculture. In 1967, the newly covered sectors employed about eight million workers ages 25 to 55, or about 21 percent of the U.S. prime-age work force. And, crucially, nearly one-third of Black workers were employed in these sectors. White workers greatly benefited from the 1966 law; Black workers gained even more. In addition to being overrepresented in the newly covered industries, Black workers earned less on average in these industries than their white counterparts. So the earnings increase caused by the reform was 10 percent on average for Black workers in the newly covered industries, twice as much as that for white workers. Based on our analysis, we estimate that the minimum wage increase was responsible for approximately 20 percent of the reduction in the earnings gap between Black and white workers between 1967 and 1980.

Economists who study gains in racial equality during that era have mostly credited improved educational outcomes for Black students (in terms of both number of years of school and quality of education) and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned explicit job discrimination. But it's clear now that the 1966 minimum wage reform also made a significant contribution. When the March on Washington took place in 1963, Black workers in the United States earned on average 59 cents for every dollar earned by the average white worker. Today, Black workers in the United States earn on average 78 cents for every dollar earned by average white workers -- a notable improvement. But this ratio has remained essentially unchanged since about 1980. In one respect, this stagnation is a gloomy affirmation of Black families' continued frustration with an economy stacked against them, four decades on. Yet it also indicates that raising and expanding the minimum wage today could be central to making progress again. The coronavirus pandemic has exposed the economic perils still faced by Black, Hispanic and Native American workers as a result of their disproportionate employment in low-wage sectors of the labor market -- jobs that while deemed invaluable ""essential work"" during this crisis often don't pay a living wage. Making the minimum wage a living wage would match politicians' rhetoric with actual public policy and would go a long way in making the lives of people of color materially better. Opponents of minimum wage increases assert that they, for one thing, reduce the number of jobs available to low-income workers. However, numerous studies of minimum wage increases across historical contexts and countries indicate that even when the minimum wage is large with respect to prior median earnings, negative effects on employment tend to be limited. Our research suggests the next Congress could raise the federal minimum wage substantially, reducing racial inequality without doing harm to the broader market. Congress, as well as governors and state legislatures, could also expand the minimum wage to cover the millions of workers whose sectors continue to be excluded from it. Establishing federal, state or local minimum wage thresholds for independent contractors, for example, would lift the often paltry take-home pay workers receive in the gig economy, where Black workers and other workers of color are overrepresented. California is in the midst of such a fight -- and facing opposition from many powerful tech giants.

Ending what's known as the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers is another opportunity to level the playing field. Despite some improved state laws, employers of tipped workers are required by federal law to pay a mere $2.13 an hour. Not only is this exemption a direct legacy of efforts to economically hobble freed people after slavery; it also continues to have an outsize effect on female Black and Hispanic workers. Tipped workers overall are twice as likely to live in poverty as the general work force. And tipped workers of color in the restaurant industry are twice as likely to live in poverty as their white counterparts. It is no coincidence that civil rights leaders in 1963 singled out the minimum wage as a critical tool for racial justice, and their demands are just as salient today. The federal minimum wage has not been raised since it went to $7.25 an hour in 2009. And inflation has reduced its value by nearly one-third from its highest real value, in 1968. If America's contemporary leaders are serious about reducing racial inequality, they must push for simple, bold measures, such as doubling the federal minimum wage. Otherwise, the country may miss an opportunity, after the largest protests for racial equality in U.S. history, to improve the lives of millions of people of color.",Diversity and inclusion programs for elites are tokens. A large wage increase that would most benefit the Black working class is far better.,2cecbf6f-13c8-57da-8401-6a7a4870ffbe,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/26/opinion/26derenoncourt-montialoux-01/26derenoncourt-montialoux-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=bad395e20b5c8de5dd36a5b4580a7609adb2389a036ebf0f5cf2301caf53c040&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,,2cecbf6f-13c8-57da-8401-6a7a4870ffbe,Demo_data/D1_img2/12cecbf6f-13c8-57da-8401-6a7a4870ffbe.jpg,11
Theater,"Review: Without Ethel Merman, a Limp 'Call Me Madam' at Encores!",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/theater/call-me-madam-review.html,"""Neither the character of Mrs. Sally Adams, nor Miss Ethel Merman, resembles any other person alive or dead."" So theatergoers who saw ""Call Me Madam"" when it opened on Broadway in 1950 were warned in the Playbill. With the first half of that warning, the show's producers might have been angling to forestall legal action from Perle Mesta, the Washington ""hostess"" whom President Truman appointed ambassador to Luxembourg in 1949. In ""Call Me Madam,"" Sally Adams, introduced in song as ""The Hostess With the Mostes' on the Ball,"" is named ambassador to a country called Lichtenburg -- and proceeds to make a mess of it. The other half of the alert, though, was simply a statement of fact. Merman's clarion voice, brusque style and ha-cha-cha exuberance made her musical theater's indispensable star for decades. But it also made most of the vehicles tailored to her gifts difficult fits for anyone else.

That at any rate is the impression left by the pulse-lowering Encores! production of ""Call Me Madam"" that opened on Wednesday at City Center, directed by Casey Hushion and starring Carmen Cusack in the Merman role. Ms. Cusack, a strong performer in other circumstances -- she emerged gleaming from the wreckage of ""Bright Star"" in 2016 -- is overpowered here by material that, if it can work at all today, can do so only when rough-handled by a mauler.

That seems to have been the happier case when Encores! first revived the show in 1995, with Tyne Daly as the ambassador. I didn't see it then, but the recording of the Irving Berlin score from that production delivers the thrill of a performance that knocks down everything in its path. And the flimsy story, not just the role of Sally Adams, requires that. When Adams, who liberally buys Washington influence with her oil millions, gets the D-list patronage job in Lichtenburg, where ""babies and cheese are our main industries,"" she thinks that because it is a duchy its citizens must be Dutch. (The musical's book is by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse.) Despite the ministrations of her eager young assistant, Kenneth Gibson (Jason Gotay), and of the embassy's imperious charge d'affaires, Pemberton Maxwell (Michael Benjamin Washington), she makes gauche mistakes in both protocol and policy. The authors' intention is clearly to satirize the underinformed internationalism of postwar America: Adams's faith in capital and capitalism leads her to attempt to solve cash-strapped Lichtenburg's problems by poulticing them with dollar bills. ""Can you use any money today?"" she sings. In a preshow welcome on Wednesday, the Encores! artistic director Jack Viertel said that one reason for revisiting ""Call Me Madam"" was to see how a political satire from 1950 differed from satire today. Fair enough -- and a few lines, whether original or interpolated, elicited rueful laughter from an audience asked to recall a period of American history when a top marginal tax rate of almost 85 percent left the treasury overflowing with the potential to do good in the world.

It's not enough that young Gibson should fall in forbidden love with Lichtenburg's Princess Maria, wittily played by Lauren Worsham as a demented Dresden doll; Adams herself must also fall at first glance for Cosmo Constantine, the handsome foreign minister. Out of excess pride and nobility, he rejects her offer of $100 million to solve the duchy's problems: ""We are waiting for your country to offer the world something more than money."" But he does not reject her affection. This leads to some lovely singing, as Ms. Cusack and her Cosmo, Ben Davis, dig into pleasantly second-drawer Berlin numbers like ""Something to Dance About,"" ""Marrying for Love"" and ""The Best Thing for You."" Ms. Cusack, who seemed as if she might be under the weather on Wednesday, could not quite pull off the necessary big notes but was lovely to listen to everywhere else; Mr. Davis is a dream. Still, the songs mostly backfire dramatically by forcing us to sympathize with characters, especially Adams, whom the book otherwise wishes us to treat as objects of surprisingly coarse satire. The form and the content are hopelessly uncoupled. It is telling, regarding both Berlin in 1950 and the production today, that the secondary characters, basically free from any hope of serving the plot, come off best. Between them, Mr. Gotay and Ms. Worsham get the evergreen duet ""It's a Lovely Day Today"" as well as a charming rarity (""Once Upon a Time, Today"") and a hilariously bizarre ""local color"" ensemble, ""The Ocarina."" The choreographer, Denis Jones, has staged this bit of period nonsense as if from the inside of a cuckoo clock. But the only time the score really breaks through the fog of mildness is when Mr. Gotay and Ms. Cusack sing the contrapuntal duet Berlin wrote quickly during the show's out-of-town tryout: ""You're Just in Love."" For a wonderful moment as the melodies intertwine, you feel in Ms. Hushion's otherwise laborious production what it must have been like when big, peculiar, unsanded personalities elevated stories instead of merely serving them. You also feel, with some emotion, that Berlin understood the difference. He wasn't a musical dramatist but a songwriter, and by 1950 he saw which way the wind was blowing. At a few key moments in ""Call Me Madam,"" he interpolates the melody of ""God Bless America,"" which he'd written more than 30 years earlier. It comes off as both a winking self-tribute and an eyes-wide-open eulogy to a world and a style he would long outlive.","This 1950 musical has some charming numbers, but without a monster personality at its center it seems like less of a comedy than a requiem.",cb8006ff-6e88-5bc2-be8e-9d189fba1609,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/08/arts/08callme-print/08callme-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=a77051023ed2355a3e346190365da0074a5d745356dba49c5fd8f1903a76445d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Can you use any money today?

Books,"Black, Gay and Losing Faith",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/books/review/uzodinma-iweala-speak-no-evil.html,"""The American dream"" is an apt phrase, because dreams are illogical. The immigrant lives at a remove from the land of her birth and the land of her choice; if it's not the White House reminding you that you don't belong, it's your kids, the fruition of your American dreams who end up just so, well, American. Niru, the narrator of 's ""Speak No Evil,"" would seem to be his Nigerian-born parents' greatest success: sociable and athletic, cultured and Harvard-bound. At the same time, Niru, because of his homosexuality, embodies this particular illogic: His gayness is no particular tragedy in the eyes of his peers, but an absolute betrayal of God's plan in the eyes of his parents. This is the central conflict in Iweala's slender book, one the author handles with admirable cool. Though Niru is still young (he's a senior in high school), he understands his parents even as they fail to understand him: ""Our father lives somewhere between the self-satisfaction that his success has made us soft and disgust that we are unacquainted with the brutal intensity of a world that he has effectively tamed for us.""

Iweala published his first book, ""Beasts of No Nation,"" in 2005, when he was only 23. It's a catalog of horrors narrated by a child soldier conscripted into an armed conflict in an unnamed West African country. It's less a novel than an exercise in voice, told in stylized, ungrammatical sentences. It doesn't add up to much, which is the point; it bears witness to something meaningless, then forces the reader to find meaning in atrocity. ""Speak No Evil"" is a quite different endeavor. Iweala is still interested in style, this time the kind of clarity we sometimes associate with Hemingway and mistakenly term simple. A characteristic passage: ""I can't think straight enough to remember where I put my keys, this pocket or that pocket, this pocket, yes. And my car? I slam my palms against the wall. Again. The skin turns pink. You are not like these white children, my mother says except on my palms that turn pink like their skin turns pink, but only when hurt, or scared or stressed."" We meet Niru in the winter of his senior year, at a tony Washington, D.C., private school. Released from classes because of a snowstorm, he seeks refuge at the nearby home of his dearest friend, Meredith, where her attempt to seduce him leads to the confession of his homosexuality. If the scene has the patina of an after-school special (earnestness, a touch of melodrama), Iweala deploys the present tense and an unfussy syntax to hook the reader, and it works well. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

Meredith, playing the role of understanding gal pal, installs Grindr and Tinder on Niru's cellphone. Of course the boy loses the phone, and the secret comes out. The ensuing confrontation with his father is violent and heartbreaking: ""Are you really telling me the truth, that you are going out and gallivanting with the gays, the homosexuals? Where did you learn this kind of behavior? Is it in school? Is this what they are teaching you?"" Not long ago, in his column for New York magazine, Andrew Sullivan wrote that ""the radicalization of the movement's ideology and rhetoric"" is to blame for ""a retrenchment in comfort with gay equality."" Iweala gives the lie to this claim elegantly; some people just hate homosexuality, no matter how much they love their children.

Niru's mother is a cosmopolitan daughter of privilege, now a physician; his father is a ""true village boy"" who climbed his way to corporate success and American comfort. Upon discovering their son's secret, they turn to faith. ""It sometimes seems that every African living in the D.C. area goes to this church, Nigerians, Ghanaians, Cameroonians, Congolese. Some work for embassies. Some are taxi drivers. Some are illegal, but they are all truly welcome."" Well, not quite all. Niru's father takes him to his boyhood home in Nigeria, where they visit still another church. This intercession, existing in the realm of the spiritual, seems less pernicious than it actually is; it's not religion but psychological torture, and it occasions a kind of break in the narrator's psyche. His parents replace his smartphone with Bible verses. ""I take the cards -- Genesis 4:7, Luke 5:32, First Corinthians 6:18 -- and put them in my pocket without looking at them. I have a stack on a shelf in my closet. They remind me of all the things I should do."" It's not Niru who is closeted any longer; it's his parents' God. Niru's homosexuality is very much the book's subject, and the text is interested in dualities -- Americans and Africans, white and black, gay and straight, devout and skeptic, the black immigrant and the black American (a role filled by Damien, a college student with whom our hero has a sweet, chaste fling) -- while always returning to the question of what his gayness says about who Niru is. Iweala writes with such ease about adolescents and adolescence that ""Speak No Evil"" could well be a young adult novel. At the same time he toys with other well-defined forms: the immigrant novel, the gay coming-of-age novel, the novel of being black in America. The resulting book is a hybrid of all these. If he's something of a remix artist, Iweala remains faithful to the conventions of these forms, a writer so adept that the book's climax feels both surprising and wholly inevitable. Its concluding third is narrated by Meredith, not Niru, a strategy that should feel clunky but doesn't. As with ""Beasts of No Nation,"" Iweala resists offering the reader much in the way of closure or even insight, as though to suggest that's the reader's job, not his. A writer cannot be judged for his project, only its execution.  is a fine and confident novelist. Genre is a useful thing when organizing texts in a bookshop, but immaterial to the particular exchange between writer and reader.

Form ossifies into genre through repetition. Eventually readers -- and writers are of course readers themselves -- understand that stories about immigrants function in a certain way, that stories about gayness require a moral reckoning, that stories about blackness require the sacrifice of the black body. For all the interest among readers in creating a literature that reflects its readership, so-called ""diverse books,"" there are times that ""diverse book"" seems itself a genre, bound by convention and largely a matter of the identity of a writer who is different from the thousand or so writers we believe to be the canon. In his smart exploration of generational conflict, of what it is to be a gay man, of the crisis of existence as a black man, Iweala is very much a realist. Perhaps the trouble is my own wish that reality itself were different.","In Uzodinma Iweala's new novel, ""Speak No Evil,"" a young man's journey of self-discovery runs into opposition from his parents and their church.",156d3f5f-3303-5710-96fa-ce8b2de2eda6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/18/books/review/18Alam/18Alam-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=8ef49868092603efad35f825a822ae6515b94aa9bfbdabf304e92634485d5b0a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Uzodinma Iweala,156d3f5f-3303-5710-96fa-ce8b2de2eda6,Demo_data/D1_img2/1156d3f5f-3303-5710-96fa-ce8b2de2eda6.jpg,13
Books,Enemies of the State: A Memoir of Coming of Age in the Soviet Union,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/books/review/girl-from-the-metropol-hotel-ludmilla-petrushevskaya.html,"THE GIRL FROM THE METROPOL HOTEL

Growing Up in Communist Russia

By Ludmilla Petrushevskaya

Translated by Anna Summers

Illustrated. 149 pp. Penguin Books. Paper, $16.

Russian literature is replete with powerful memoirs of childhood: Tolstoy, Gorky, Nabokov, Mandelstam and Tsvetayeva all wrote movingly and insightfully about growing up. And yet, when one looks for texts about children's lives after the Communist revolution, the bookshelf seems strangely empty. Where are the great memoirs of Soviet childhood? Perhaps the traditional narrative approach taken by Tolstoy or Nabokov cannot effectively depict the spare, hungry life of a child in a totalitarian state.

Ludmilla Petrushevskaya's slender, fragmentary memoir, ""The Girl From the Metropol Hotel,"" is strangely much closer in tone and craft to Soviet absurdist poetry than it is to these classic memoirs. That poetry is exemplified by authors such as Daniil Kharms and Aleksander Vvedensky, known for their farcical depictions of early Soviet life in all its casual brutality. The reader feels the echo of such poems when Petrushevskaya's younger self, a girl who's been desperately hungry for most of her life, finds herself in possession of a fistful of silver coins. What does she do? She throws them into the courtyard, watching with a smile as dirty boys swarm to retrieve them, as each dropped coin ""caused a new explosion of howling and fighting."" If this memoir of growing up on the streets of the Soviet Union follows a logic, it is the violent, chaotic logic of Soviet history itself.

As the girl from the Metropol Hotel, Petrushevskaya was born into an elite Bolshevik family in 1938, in the midst of great misfortune: Several family members were executed by Stalin's firing squads. The family became ""enemies to everyone,"" Petrushevskaya writes, ""to our neighbors, to the police, to the janitors, to the passers-by, to every resident of our courtyard of any age. We were not allowed to use the shared bathroom, to wash our clothes, and we didn't have soap anyway. At the age of 9 I was unfamiliar with shoes, with handkerchiefs, with combs; I did not know what school or discipline was.""","Ludmilla Petrushevskaya's ""The Girl from the Metropol Hotel"" is a memoir of coming of age in hardship in the Soviet Union.",0f51f504-eb7b-547a-9e90-c9435591c34d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/12/books/review/12Kaminsky-sub/12Kaminsky-sub-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=9684967e16b3f0ff09d739fa7e03e5be56532ac3f243c4b43534fefd77fd946a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ludmilla Petrushevskaya, 1948.",0f51f504-eb7b-547a-9e90-c9435591c34d,Demo_data/D1_img2/10f51f504-eb7b-547a-9e90-c9435591c34d.jpg,13
Opinion,There Are Evangelicals Who Stand Against Trump. I'm One of Them.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/opinion/trump-evangelicals.html,"Like many kids who grew up as evangelicals, I was taught that abortion was the only issue when it comes to politics. When I turned 18, in the 1990s, my father took me to the Allen County Republican headquarters in my Indiana town, where I registered as a card-carrying conservative. Then we went to Fort Wayne's Famous Coney Island for celebratory chili dogs. ""It doesn't matter who is president for a term or two,"" Dad told me. ""We vote for the candidates who want to protect the dignity of human life."" And those candidates were all in the Republican Party. Though abortion was the core battle, evangelicals have rallied around various flags of the culture wars for my life. One of the first of these I remember was when Andres Serrano's photograph of a crucifix suspended in urine caused a backlash among evangelicals. Dad said it was a disgrace; I agreed with him. Neither of us knew that Serrano was Catholic -- not that knowing that would have made us more sympathetic to him -- or took seriously the interpretation that the piece was a reaction to the exploitation of Christian iconography. To us, and to the church and broader community to which we belonged, it was blasphemy. And it was worth raising hell over.

A lifetime raised in a culture prepared to go to war over immorality made it especially disorienting when Donald Trump rode down a golden escalator into the presidential campaign, and captured 81 percent of the white evangelical vote. Trump mocked a reporter with physical disabilities, bragged about groping women, retweeted comments likening him to ""the second coming of God."" He was accused by multiple women of sexual assault. He claimed he didn't pray to God for forgiveness. But instead of outrage, in defense of a basic sense of morality, loyalty to Mr. Trump only seemed to grow among white evangelicals. Their loyalty remained, even when the American president left a bunker in the White House, scattering a peaceful protest with aggressive riot-control tactics after the killing of George Floyd so he could walk to a church, hold a Bible, and have a photo taken. ""We don't like him,"" evangelical friends tell me, ""but we don't have a choice if we believe in religious liberty and the sanctity of life."" They sound a lot like my father delivering his Coney Island argument for one-issue voting back in 1996. The coming election is less about whom evangelicals are voting against and more about whom we're voting for. White American evangelicals appear to be unrattled no matter what stunts, antics, gaffes or pandering we see from the president. Our bond to the Trump administration appears to be growing even stronger. We want Mr. Trump in office. More of us do now than in 2016. The Trump administration is offering us a conservative court, and with it, the possibility of Roe v. Wade's overturn. But at the heart of this election, more than abortion, religious liberty, or any other single issue, is fear. We are afraid of losing dominance over people who look and live differently than us. Evangelicals are afraid to lose power, and Trump offers us access to it. Polls again show Trump with a commanding lead among white evangelical voters.

But about 19 percent of the millions of white voters who identify as evangelical did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016, and millions of them will not be voting for him in 2020. I'm one of them. Evangelicalism has always been a big tent, and I'm in it, too. Even though we are so deeply divided, I've seen the generative love and humanity of so many conservative Christians. Like millions of other American Christians, I'm politically progressive, and I also believe in the sanctity of all life -- whether in the womb or out. I've been a Presbyterian for 15 years, but pretending my roots aren't in evangelicalism would be disingenuous, and also allow my identity to be shaped by a stereotype I don't fit. Evangelicals are protesting after the death of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor -- we are, without hesitation, denouncing racism. Many of us are pro-all of life. We're against the death penalty, denounce white supremacists, welcome refugees and believe in equal pay for women and equal rights for all people. As a deacon at my church, I help provide homeless teenagers with meals purchased from minority-owned restaurants struggling to stay open during the pandemic. Like those in thousands of other churches, we show up for our city. The couple of million of us who stand against Mr. Trump are holding on to hope that the good work Christians do out of the spotlight can salvage our public witness and outshine the hypocrisy burning brightly from our ranks. The work of rebuilding begins with following the lead of our Black and brown brothers and sisters, bringing old sins of racism and sexism into new light. By lifting up just about anyone Mr. Trump has belittled to gain dominance. Christians are called to not just tolerate, but also welcome the stranger and serve the poor. To be hospitable, not judgmental, to people across racial, gender and socioeconomic lines. To do a better job of listening, repenting and voting with the marginalized and the underprivileged. There will most likely be overwhelming white evangelical support for Mr. Trump this election. But regardless of the outcome, there is a sizable remnant of evangelicals who will persist in choosing human flourishing over fear.

Real Estate,The Closed Kitchen Makes a Comeback,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/realestate/the-closed-kitchen-makes-a-comeback.html,"During a New Year's Eve dinner party several years ago, fun and laughter quickly turned to anguish for Jennifer McAllister-Nevins. The pipes in her kitchen were suddenly blocked. And because she lived in a TriBeCa apartment with an open kitchen, all the guests got to witness each chaotic moment as the sink backed up. It's no surprise that Ms. McAllister-Nevins, who loves to entertain, now lives in a different TriBeCa loft, one with an enclosed kitchen. ""Sometimes I'm not as organized as I hoped, and other times there's just a mess,"" she said. Her next event at home is a party next month for Savor, a company she owns with a friend, which makes stylish keepsake boxes. ""I like having the option of having your kitchen be a private or public space.""

Open-kitchen floor plans have dominated home design for years, especially in new construction, and kitchen size has expanded as a result. Reviewing average kitchen size in a dozen new developments and apartment building conversions before 2000, the real estate firm Engel & Volkers found that the average kitchen accounted for about 6 percent of the total square footage of the apartment. But in comparable developments after 2010, the agency found that as kitchens have been opened up to adjoining dining or living rooms, the average kitchen now takes up about 8 percent of the entire apartment.

Kitchen size aside, the pendulum has started to swing back toward enclosed kitchens. Several new residential buildings in Manhattan have offered separated kitchens -- a nod to prewar apartment design, but also to the growing demand from potential buyers looking for separate cooking and entertaining spaces. ""I grew up in the Upper East Side and never saw an open kitchen,"" said Edward Yedid, a partner of Grade New York, an interior design and architecture firm. When designing the Twenty 1, a nine-unit condominium at 117 West 21st Street in Chelsea, Mr. Yedid decided to separate the kitchens because the units were all floor-through, with space to incorporate walls and hallways. He chose to use sliding solid oak doors in the kitchen in six units, so the residents would have ""control on how they used the kitchen,"" he said. ""For someone who isn't sure if they want an open or closed kitchen, pocket doors are a great feature,"" Mr. Yedid said.

Mark Kolodziejczak, a partner of Studio Tractor Architecture, a firm hired by Ms. McAllister-Nevins to renovate her current TriBeCa loft, said he has long discussions with clients about how they foresee using the kitchen. Do they prefer having a kitchen that will be the social center of the home or something more muted? While the kitchen in Ms. McAllister-Nevins's new apartment was separate from the entertaining space, it did not have doors, so she decided to install two large pocket doors, a design accent that seems to be gaining popularity. Of the roughly 450 respondents to a recent survey by the National Kitchen and Bath Association, a trade group made up of kitchen and bath designers and suppliers, about 70 percent said they used pocket doors as part of a kitchen remodeling or new construction project in 2015. Bryan Cho, an executive vice president of the Related Companies, said his company had not built a residential building with a closed-kitchen floor plan since the 1990s. But demand for larger rental apartments for families was high, he said, so Related included 45 three- and four-bedroom apartments in the Easton, a high-rise rental at 205 East 92nd Street with 230 units. All these larger units will have closed kitchens. Some will have open entries; others will have space for a small table, or a dining alcove attached. ""I think some people are attracted to a more formal way of life, so maybe the trend is shifting between having a big open space to cook and entertain to having some separation,"" Mr. Cho said.

But if you have more room, you can get creative, said Mr. Penick, whose company is a developer of 53W53, a condominium tower that is rising next to the Museum of Modern Art. More than 90 percent of the units in the building will have separate kitchens that can be closed by a floor-to-ceiling automatic sliding door, he said. The extra wall space created by enclosing a kitchen opens up more design options, Mr. Penick said. ""There's more storage, more counter space and room to populate kitchen-specific designs."" Closed kitchens also work well for those who entertain a lot and hire caterers and private chefs. ""You don't want your dinner party guests to walk through the kitchen and see what's being served,"" said Phillip Mendlow, a senior vice president of Bluerock Real Estate, which developed the Charles, a 27-unit condominium on the Upper East Side where all apartments come with closed kitchens.

Some developers are also testing out hybrid kitchen floor plans. Ian Schrager, a developer who recently broke ground on 160 Leroy, said all of the 49 condo units will have two fully equipped kitchens. The 300-square-foot enclosed chef's kitchen can be closed off by a sliding door, while the adjacent open ""social kitchen"" is anchored by a large marble island and countertop. He said he took the idea from his own home, where he custom-installed a second, ""dirty"" kitchen. ""I personally don't mind when people cook and wash dishes in front of me,"" Mr. Schrager said. ""I like the social aspect of an open kitchen. But some people don't like that."" The two-kitchen concept isn't new. Many farms and suburban homes traditionally had second kitchens, often called summer kitchens, so the heat from the stove didn't raise the temperature in the entire house during the summer. In a stand-alone hut on the property, or in a small room in the back of the house or in the basement, they were used for butchering meat and making and preserving jams.","The pendulum is starting to swing back toward enclosed kitchens.

Media,"In Super Bowl Commercials, Puppy Is a Winner",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/03/business/puppy-emerges-a-winner-in-viewers-taste-for-super-bowl-ads.html,"The advertising lesson from Super Bowl XLIX: Ads with puppies continue to score with viewers while spots featuring a dead child are seen as a major fumble. By several counts, Budweiser led the pack of game day advertisers with a spot that depicted its iconic Clydesdale horses rescuing a lost puppy and taking it home. The ad attracted more than 4.2 million online views by midday Monday and captured 12 percent of online activity about the Super Bowl spots, according to a measurement firm, iSpot.tv.

Budweiser, which also ran an ad celebrating its brewing process, was mentioned more than 234,000 times on social media during the game, with nearly half of the comments expressing a positive sentiment and many more neutral, according to Amobee, which tracks digital response to brands.

In stark contrast, another much-talked-about spot was Nationwide's morbid commercial that showed a young boy saying that he will never learn to ride a bike, get ""cooties,"" learn to fly, travel the world or marry because he died from a preventable accident. While the brand was trying to highlight its ""Make Safe Happen"" program about increasing safety at home, the spot angered viewers.

Nationwide was mentioned more than 238,000 times on social media, with 64 percent of those comments negative, according to Amobee. (Nationwide ran another spot featuring the actress Mindy Kaling that seemed to resonate more positively.) ""The sole purpose of this message was to start a conversation, not sell insurance,"" Nationwide said in a statement. ""We want to build awareness of an issue that is near and dear to all of us -- the safety and well being of our children.""

Another highlight was a commercial for Procter & Gamble's Always feminine products that asked what it meant to do a physical activity ""like a girl."" The ad focused on how girls often lose their confidence after they go through puberty. It showed little girls answering the question by running fast and punching strong, while older children and adults answered by acting weak.

The Always spot captured 8.6 percent of online activity and 1.6 million viewers, according to iSpot.tv. NBC showed 48 minutes of ads during Sunday's game, according to Kantar Media. That included about seven minutes of network promotions. Sunday's game featured ads from 15 first-time Super Bowl advertisers. Amobee said that the ""Rookie of the Year"" award went to Skittles, which generated more than 85,000 social mentions, more than three times those for some other newbies. In addition to its humorous spot, the brand received a boost when Marshawn Lynch, the Seahawks running back, was seen gobbling the rainbow-colored candy moments before the game began.","The Budweiser ad, which also featured the brand's Clydesdale horses, scored big on social media, while a Nationwide spot angered viewers.",80ab369a-eb7c-5177-8ed9-8192c5c3494a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/03/business/03SUPERADS2/03SUPERADS2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=6edcec3b450fd387d62bba7944a7ad5d6ccd4a6e8155e133670ce467fcb71876&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A Budweiser spot featuring a lost puppy, was a Super Bowl favorite based on online views and activity.",80ab369a-eb7c-5177-8ed9-8192c5c3494a,Demo_data/D1_img2/180ab369a-eb7c-5177-8ed9-8192c5c3494a.jpg,16

Sports,UConn? Worried? Not as Long as Auriemma Is in Charge,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/sports/ncaabasketball/uconn-womens-basketball.html,"UNCASVILLE, Conn. -- No, Geno Auriemma said with customary bluntness, he is not worried about the coronavirus outbreak. And he finds it a bit absurd that teams are being asked to refrain from postgame handshakes after sharing a germ-ridden basketball and sweating all over one another for two hours. ""I mean, come on,"" he said. Nor does Auriemma share conventional wisdom that the dynasty that is Connecticut women's basketball might be in jeopardy in his 35th season as head coach. In fact, he has a new joke to deflate such thinking. ""You know how many religions there are in the world?"" Auriemma said. ""The one religion in women's college basketball is praying that UConn loses."" For the record, UConn defeated Cincinnati, 87-53, in the A.A.C. tournament final on Monday. The conference tournament was played at the Mohegan Sun casino complex in Uncasville, Conn., and, amid the jingle of slot machines and the spinning of roulette wheels, UConn success was hardly a gamble. The Huskies have played 139 games in the conference and have won them all. They will never lose, in fact, as they are set to return to the Big East next season.

But success in the N.C.A.A. tournament is no longer such a sure bet. UConn has appeared in 12 consecutive Final Fours, yet no player on the current roster has won a national title. A 13th straight trip to the national semifinals this season seems uncertain after losses by double-digits to the country's three best teams: South Carolina, Oregon and Baylor. A 12th national title for Auriemma has remained elusive since 2016. What does it mean? For starters, it means that UConn has set such an impossibly high standard that even the slightest leveling brings prewritten obituaries on the pending death of the Huskies' dominance. Does it mean anything else? Is this young team, which has lacked depth and the Huskies' usual big-game swagger, a mere anomaly? Or are we witnessing an inevitable flattening out caused by a shift reflected by the arc of history, unsettling financial realities at UConn, the changing nature of recruiting and the continued broadening of the women's game westward and southward? First, a couple of caveats. UConn (29-3) has lost this season only to three surefire No. 1 seeds in the N.C.A.A. tournament. Four current starters will return next year. And this year's thin team will be buttressed next season by a highly-regarded transfer and five freshmen, including the nation's top recruit, Paige Bueckers, a 5-foot-11 inch guard from Eden Prairie, Minn. Already, her skill and temperament have drawn comparisons to the former UConn star Diana Taurasi. So no one is exactly pushing the panic button.

The men's and women's college game have developed at a nearly identical pace. But U.C.L.A. has won only one title since 1975, and it is now only a middling power in an age of increased parity. Can UConn, bucolic but isolated in Storrs, Conn., avoid a similar drift? Especially with an athletic department that ran a deficit of more than $40 million in fiscal 2019 and exists outside a Power 5 conference, while women's powers in the Southeastern, Pac 12 and Big 12 conferences offer verdant campuses and the security of football bounty? Check out the men's rankings, Auriemma admonished when I brought up the issue. Seven of the top 16 teams -- Gonzaga, Dayton and San Diego State among them -- are not from Power 5 conferences. Neither is Villanova, which won national titles in 2016 and in 2018. ""I can't speak for after I leave, but as long as I'm coaching here, we won't be hard to find,"" Auriemma said. ""We won't be drifting away. You'll know exactly where we are. And that's not going to change one iota."" Auriemma turns 66 this month. And he said he could see himself coaching another five years. UConn is in the hunt for the nation's top projected recruit for 2021, Azzi Fudd, a 5-foot-11 guard from Washington, D.C., and a close friend of Bueckers, the incoming freshman star. Recruits now often want something more personal than a coach-player relationship. Dawn Staley of South Carolina, the 2017 national champion, signed four of the top 13 high school players for the current season after her staff applied a full-court press ""talking to every single person that's involved in their lives."" Auriemma prefers to be seen as an instructor, not a friend, to his players. To adjust, he now casts a wider net for talent. For next season, he has signed, among others, guards from Canada and Croatia. Evina Westbrook, a transfer guard from Tennessee sitting out this season, also will be eligible.","After a trying season for Coach Geno Auriemma and his team, UConn's women find themselves in a familiar position: with a chance to win a 12th national championship.",b6221509-ec38-5039-946d-9876013cd065,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/10/sports/10uconn-top/10uconn-top-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=60861a01adc3c43aacbe95957a80433dc1b37d58cbcc15b293a7f48a8bb73c36&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,UConn spent seven years in the American Athletic Conference and never lost a game.,b6221509-ec38-5039-946d-9876013cd065,Demo_data/D1_img2/1b6221509-ec38-5039-946d-9876013cd065.jpg,9

Opinion,'We Were Always Men',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/opinion/15th-amendment-anniversary-gates.html,"The received scientific wisdom of the day drew from the same pool of ""self-evident truths"" as did Chief Justice Taney. The Swiss naturalist Louis Agassiz offered the same rationale for slavery. Agassiz had come to believe that people of different races had not descended from a single Adam, but rather from different Adams, who lived in different parts of the world. Therefore, he said, it would be a mistake ""to assume that races have the same abilities, enjoy the same powers, and show the same natural dispositions, and that in consequence of this equality they are entitled to the same position in human society.""

Douglass knew that all else in the quest for the abolition of slavery, and equal status and protection under the laws depended on the refutation of the scandalous allegation that the genetic origins and social and cultural evolution of black people constituted prima facie justification for their second-class status.

He had to devote much of his oratory simply to ""proving"" the humanity of black people. Speaking at Western Reserve College in 1854, in one of the first commencement addresses ever delivered by an African-American, Douglass deconstructed word by word a recent editorial in the notoriously racist Richmond Examiner that argued that ""the negro"" did not have the same right to liberty and the pursuit of happiness as the white man. The reason: ""BECAUSE HE IS NOT A MAN.""

Douglass, in his remarks, made his own declaration: ""Tried by all the usual, and all the unusual tests, whether mental, moral, physical, or psychological, the negro is a MAN -- considering him as possessing knowledge, or needing knowledge, his elevation or his degradation, his virtues, or his vices -- whichever road you take, you reach the same conclusion: The negro is a MAN.""

Sixteen years later, when the 15th Amendment was ratified, Douglass knew that while one battle may have been won, the forces of white supremacy and pro-slavery stubbornly persisted, as he warned in his speech ""Our Composite Nationality"" in 1869. Unfortunately, he was right: The promises of Reconstruction gave way to the destructive emergence of Jim Crow. In the continued need for African-Americans to account for their own humanity, we see permutations of Douglass's struggle: from the British antislavery catchphrase popularized in the 1780s, ""Am I Not a Man and a Brother?,"" to the Memphis sanitation workers' signs proclaiming ""I Am a Man"" on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination and in the very phrase ""Black Lives Matter.""

Much has been made lately of the metaphor that anti-black racism is part of the DNA of American culture. Some have taken offense, presuming incorrectly that the genetic allusion suggests that America is unalterably racist. Rather, the metaphor means to say that anti-black racism has been passed down through the generations as an elemental aspect of American history and American culture.

Genetics is not determinism. The 20,000 or so genes that compose the human genome can each be silenced or amplified. Think of our genomes as akin to a piano keyboard: The melodies it yields depend upon how it's played. Racism, like anti-Semitism, is a chord that we can choose to play or not. Or think of racism as a cultural mutation. The introduction of that tainted mutation into our country's founding -- and the weight it continues to place on black people to prove themselves worthy of inclusion over and over again -- is what is meant by racism being part of our DNA. Mutations cannot be silenced by pretending they are not there; they cannot be silenced by being censored or shouted down. Mutations do not magically go away. But they can be combated, as the 15th Amendment sought to combat the long history of denying the manhood of black American men.","One hundred and fifty years ago, Frederick Douglass understood the link between voting rights and manhood for African-Americans.",90da9130-079d-5c7d-9492-fe26b9b22201,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/10/opinion/10Gates/10Gates-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=1f167ea9e5729051646324dbe0104c89e78ab43183da5b4c454be4e945596acb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"One of several large commemorative prints marking the enactment of the Fifteenth Amendment, on March 30, 1870.",90da9130-079d-5c7d-9492-fe26b9b22201,Demo_data/D1_img2/190da9130-079d-5c7d-9492-fe26b9b22201.jpg,11
Food,"Thomas Keller Opens Another Napa Valley Spot. This Time, It's a Taqueria.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/dining/nyc-restaurant-openings.html,"Thomas Keller, the world-famous chef and restaurateur, is adding to his busy portfolio in Yountville, Calif., in the Napa Valley with a casual taqueria. He had the opportunity to take over a local fixture, Hurley's restaurant, when its owner decided to retire. ""It's a beautiful location,"" Mr. Keller said. ""But I didn't know what to do with it, so I thought about what the town needed."" Yountville already had Italian, French and American restaurants, including Mr. Keller's French Laundry, but Asian and Mexican were missing. He decided on Mexican, a cuisine he has never explored, and contacted Susana Trilling, a food writer who has a cooking school and inn in Oaxaca , Mexico. It turned out that her son, Kaelin Ulrich Trilling, who was born and raised in Oaxaca, was a chef and had even been doing consulting in New York. ""We saw eye-to-eye,"" Mr. Keller said. Mr. Trilling, 26, got the job and traveled throughout Mexico before opening the restaurant. Though his menu is fairly simple, it includes various regional specialties, like an assortment of moles, often made from chiles and spices imported from Mexico. Tortillas are made from corn ground and nixtamalized in-house. ""We're making them by hand; we expect to hand-press 700 to 800 a day,"" he said. Tacos feature braised short-rib barbacoa, roasted pork ""al pastor"" and slow-cooked pork carnitas. Marinated wood-grilled fish and wood-grilled skirt steak are also offered. The restaurant is decorated with pieces from Mexican artisans. ""We have to respect the traditions,"" Mr. Trilling said. The name is that of a celebratory parade and feast frequently held in Oaxaca. (Opens Dec. 30)

From the day it opened in 2013, the Dead Rabbit, an award-winning bar with a brogue, has been a sardine can. Now, the founders and managing partners, Jack McGarry and Sean Muldoon, and their partners have taken over some floors in an adjacent building and are using its ground floor to more than double the size of the popular taproom. So now it's maybe more like two sardine cans. There are additional stools and elbow room at a long bar, several counters and some tables, including two enclosed booths for eight to 10 called ""snugs."" The second-floor parlor, a somewhat Victorian-looking pub serving elaborate cocktails, is also extending into the new building but will not open for about eight weeks. The expansion has permitted the owners to renovate and enlarge the kitchen, so they are adding dishes like steak and fries, fish sandwiches and chicken curry.

It has been a little more than a year since this restaurant was opened by the chef Jean-Louis Dumonet, who has not been in the kitchen of a New York restaurant for quite some time (he was at a private club), and his wife, Karen Dumonet. It will close at the end of Sunday. Mr. Dumonet is being lured away by a new career prospect that he's calling too good to refuse. Details will be announced early next year, he said.","An expansion for the award-winning Dead Rabbit, a restaurant closing in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, and more restaurant news.",26bddbdb-3ffa-5e6e-a1c1-ab43572e9c1b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/26/autossell/26OFF1/26OFF1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=0031ffc07c9ea435c269abfa510b5616a5f630b79051b472050e588cebe2f33c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The tacos de carnitas at La Calenda, Thomas Keller&rsquo;s newest restaurant, in Yountville, Calif.",26bddbdb-3ffa-5e6e-a1c1-ab43572e9c1b,Demo_data/D1_img2/126bddbdb-3ffa-5e6e-a1c1-ab43572e9c1b.jpg,17
