Technology,The Sun Sets. The Wind Dies. But Energy Data Is Relentless.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/technology/personaltech/the-sun-sets-the-wind-dies-but-energy-data-is-relentless.html,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Ivan Penn, who covers alternative energy for The Times from Los Angeles, discussed the tech he's using. Q. A lot of alternative energy is basically technology. What are some of the most unusual ideas around alternative energy you've seen break out over the years? A. Much of the energy sector these days focuses on energy storage -- that's where a lot of innovation is taking place. Because solar and wind energy are intermittent, utilities look for ways to capture the unused power for when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow. Lithium-ion batteries are commonly known, but engineers are also working on storing compressed air generated by using excess solar and wind and releasing it later to power a turbine. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power proposes to turn Hoover Dam into a giant battery by making it a hydro-pumped storage plant. The dam already generates electricity, but the utility wants to pump water back into the upper reservoir to produce more electricity using solar and wind electricity to power the pump -- another form of storage.

But storage isn't the only focus. Engineers continue to study other forms of energy, like capturing the power of ocean waves. And some countries are using the internet for peer-to-peer electricity trading of the solar power they generate. Battery technology is something that everyone wants to see improve. What are the challenges to broader deployment of batteries in the energy sector? The biggest issue has been cost. Batteries have been very expensive, but that's changing fairly quickly. Just as with the rapid drop in price in solar panels, batteries to store electricity have rapidly declined in cost, most likely making them more affordable within the next few years.

How has tech changed the power grid as a whole? Just in the last decade, the 100-year model of utilities producing electricity and selling power to consumers was turned on its head. Improvements in solar panel efficiency and lower product cost enabled consumers on a wide scale to produce their own power and sell it back to the electric grid. The grid was never designed to be a two-way street. So that has led to a reimagining of it. Utility companies must rethink the services they provide. No longer just power companies, utilities provide new services like vehicle charging stations for the growing number of electric cars. Along with producing their own power, people now benefit from improvements in energy efficiency, which has resulted in flat or reduced electricity use across the country -- another adjustment for the power companies. Light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, highly efficient appliances and smart technology have changed the way we use power. What kind of tech setup do you have for work? The alternative energy beat often is data driven, so tech is critical. Google Sheets and Excel help me manage data from the United States Energy Information Administration, the Solar Energy Industries Association and the California Solar and Storage Association.

Outside of work, what tech do you and your family love? How do you use it? Our house is full of computers, mostly Apple -- MacBooks, iPads and iPhones -- though we use other tablets as well. The gadgets get their fair share of schoolwork activity, but they're also tools of social media, music, art, websites, programming, Hulu and Netflix. Entertainment is big. So there are several gaming systems, old and more recent, like various Nintendo systems as well as Xbox. But as if all of that weren't enough, my sons built their own computer with money they made during the summer at a fast food chicken restaurant so they could play and make video games they hope to sell. So far they're planning more than developing, but perhaps that might fall under the category of research. How has the tech industry swept into Los Angeles? And how has the city changed as a result? Without a doubt, energy technology is a staple of Southern California, given that the state is the leader in solar power. Residential solar is prolific. But technology is really changing transportation. Of course, there are Uber and Lyft, but electric vehicles have also given rise to new companies like Tesloop, which will take you from Los Angeles to San Diego in a Tesla for as little as $29 (snacks included). Prices go as high as about $84, and all users have to do is register and request a ride online. My daughter sometimes uses the service to get to and from the University of California, San Diego, where she goes to school, or uses ride shares through social media.

Hala (Geraldine Viswanathan) is a 17-year-old Pakistani-American. She wears a hijab, she skateboards, and she prefers morning masturbation to morning prayers. This awkward Chicago teenager's story could easily have been shaped to fit a typical coming-of-age rebellion film: She has strict parents, has a crush on a boy they wouldn't like, and is sneaking around with him anyway. Instead of playing the scenario for laughs, though, the director Minhal Baig treats her character's hyphenated identity and her search for independence with quiet respect. Baig, who is Muslim and grew up in Chicago, drew upon her own senior year of high school for the film.

If you thought we were already at peak true crime, behold: a fictional series about making true crime media. Kathleen Barber's novel ""Are You Sleeping"" portrays a true-crime podcaster as a heartless vulture, but this adaptation is very much on the podcaster's side. (Sarah Koenig, of ""Serial"" fame, consulted on the show.) Octavia Spencer plays Poppy Parnell, a Bay Area journalist who doubts the evidence that convicted a teenager of murder some 20 years ago. She creates a ""Serial""-style podcast series, which asks the audience to reconsider the case, too (Spencer has Poppy's intimate podcast vocal delivery down pat). Her efforts to free the long-incarcerated Warren Cave (Aaron Paul) are not universally welcomed -- the police, the victim's relatives and even Poppy's own family all have objections, but Poppy plows on.

The serial killer Henry Lee Lucas has taught law enforcement a couple of embarrassing lessons. First, don't offer your perp strawberry milkshakes in exchange for each confession of murder. Second, don't give him case files to study and crime-scene clues to stir his ""memory."" This five-part documentary examines how Texas Rangers and detectives from 40 other states botched the Lucas investigation with these techniques in the early 1980s. Lucas claimed to have randomly murdered more than 600 people around the country (an imaginary spree that was the basis for the 1986 movie ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer""). Police kept questioning him about thousands of cases, despite increasing indications that Lucas was making it all up. Authorities now believe Lucas's kills were actually in the single or double digits, meaning hundreds of murders to which he'd confessed were returned into the vast sea of unsolved homicides. In Noah Baumbach's new film, a divorce lawyer played by Alan Alda characterizes the sundering of marital bonds as ""a death without a body."" But the way it plays out here, between the actress Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and her theater-director husband Charlie (Adam Driver), divorce is more like a love autopsy. The couple starts off wanting an amicable split, but once the expensive lawyers are involved, every stray comment or innocent mistake is scrutinized and weaponized, the story of their marriage rewritten with each cast as the villain to the other. Baumbach's unflinching examination of the imploding union spares neither party, and Johansson and Driver's commitment to their characters is devastating.

The standup comic Ronny Chieng has a lot on his mind, including politics, civil liberties, immigration, consumerism, subway etiquette and wedding planning. But Chieng is at his most incisive when he's blowing up stereotypes: Why do Asian-American immigrants want their first-generation children to become doctors, but then neglect to see doctors themselves? What if Asian-Americans became the impartial referees of all disputes among other races? (""No hatred, just solutions."") And what would it be like if an Asian-American were voted into the White House? This leads to a very funny rant, but Chieng doesn't really seem to be joking. Who knows what Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger, then Pope Benedict XVI (Anthony Hopkins), and Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the future Pope Francis (Jonathan Pryce), might have said to each other in private meetings six years ago? In this film, the writer Anthony McCarten and the director Fernando Meirelles imagine that the these two very different churchmen -- one a conservative traditionalist, the other considered a more liberal reformer -- had a momentous dialogue that led to the resignation of one man and the ascension of the other. Discussed are issues of sexual abuse and financial malfeasance, and nothing less than the future of the Roman Catholic Church appears to at stake. Even though the movie is pure speculation, the discussion is riveting, and the master actors Hopkins and Pryce create the illusion of actually having it. Rom-coms have long celebrated stalking -- think Lloyd Dobler and his boombox in ""Say Anything."" The dark conceit of the psychosexual thriller ""You"" is that the obsessive protagonist, Joe Goldberg, sees himself as a romantic hero, despite being a serial killer. Following his Season 1 murder spree, Joe now needs a change of scenery. So for Season 2 he relocates to Los Angeles -- a town he hates, providing much fodder for his biting voice-over. The plot this time is largely derived from Caroline Kepnes' novel ""Hidden Bodies,"" the sequel to her ""You."" An unfortunately named woman, Love (played by Victoria Pedretti from ""The Haunting of Hill House""), comes into Joe's orbit as the bodies start dropping again. Could it be that Joe has finally met his soul mate? Or has he just met his match? The ""Austin Powers"" series, ""Malcolm X"" and ""Searching for Sugar Man.""

It's time to hit the road, as Midge Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan) embarks on her first tour, opening for the musician Shy Baldwin on a circuit that takes her from Las Vegas to Florida. Along for the ride, of course, is Midge's manager, Susie Myerson (Alex Borstein), who gets a crash course on contract negotiations. Though a great opportunity for Midge, the tour presents a number of problems, so insecurities are high, nerves are frayed and bad options start to look rather tempting. (It's Vegas, after all.) The show's trademark rat-a-tat repartee only gets better with new banter partners joining the cast: Liza Weil (""Gilmore Girls""), Stephanie Hsu (""The Path"") and Cary Elwes (""Stranger Things""). ""A Better Life,"" ""Almost Famous,"" ""The Aviator,"" ""Footloose,"" ""Hamlet,"" ""Hancock,"" ""The Pawnbroker"" and ""Some Kind of Wonderful.""

Eleven-year-old Jonas Brodsky is both precocious and deaf, and he wants to play Beethoven's Sonata No. 14, a piece the great composer wrote as he was losing his own hearing. In this documentary, Jonas's mom, the filmmaker Irene Taylor Brodsky, combines real footage and animation to tell her son's story, exploring the aural world of a gifted child with cochlear implants. Brodsky's deaf father, Paul, who invented TTY, the first telecommunications device for the deaf, wonders if advances in genetics and technology might mean that ""there will be no deafness in the future."" Brodsky herself suggests that Jonas' musical memory technique turns deafness from a disability into a gift.

The characters in this Tarantino-inflected neo-noir are a new breed of femmes fatales -- less seductive, but more, well, fatal. Although this highly stylized show (there are touches of Lynch and echoes of Hitchcock, too,) is nominally concerned with the activities of the men in the Banished Brawlers gang, the story really revs up when the gang's auxiliary women take charge. Worth extra-close attention is Abigail Spencer's Katherine Harlow, who always seems to be several steps ahead of everybody else. ""All my life, people have been underestimating me,"" she says.

Hala (Geraldine Viswanathan) is a 17-year-old Pakistani-American. She wears a hijab, she skateboards, and she prefers morning masturbation to morning prayers. This awkward Chicago teenager's story could easily have been shaped to fit a typical coming-of-age rebellion film: She has strict parents, has a crush on a boy they wouldn't like, and is sneaking around with him anyway. Instead of playing the scenario for laughs, though, the director Minhal Baig treats her character's hyphenated identity and her search for independence with quiet respect. Baig, who is Muslim and grew up in Chicago, drew upon her own senior year of high school for the film.

If you thought we were already at peak true crime, behold: a fictional series about making true crime media. Kathleen Barber's novel ""Are You Sleeping"" portrays a true-crime podcaster as a heartless vulture, but this adaptation is very much on the podcaster's side. (Sarah Koenig, of ""Serial"" fame, consulted on the show.) Octavia Spencer plays Poppy Parnell, a Bay Area journalist who doubts the evidence that convicted a teenager of murder some 20 years ago. She creates a ""Serial""-style podcast series, which asks the audience to reconsider the case, too (Spencer has Poppy's intimate podcast vocal delivery down pat). Her efforts to free the long-incarcerated Warren Cave (Aaron Paul) are not universally welcomed -- the police, the victim's relatives and even Poppy's own family all have objections, but Poppy plows on.

The serial killer Henry Lee Lucas has taught law enforcement a couple of embarrassing lessons. First, don't offer your perp strawberry milkshakes in exchange for each confession of murder. Second, don't give him case files to study and crime-scene clues to stir his ""memory."" This five-part documentary examines how Texas Rangers and detectives from 40 other states botched the Lucas investigation with these techniques in the early 1980s. Lucas claimed to have randomly murdered more than 600 people around the country (an imaginary spree that was the basis for the 1986 movie ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer""). Police kept questioning him about thousands of cases, despite increasing indications that Lucas was making it all up. Authorities now believe Lucas's kills were actually in the single or double digits, meaning hundreds of murders to which he'd confessed were returned into the vast sea of unsolved homicides. In Noah Baumbach's new film, a divorce lawyer played by Alan Alda characterizes the sundering of marital bonds as ""a death without a body."" But the way it plays out here, between the actress Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and her theater-director husband Charlie (Adam Driver), divorce is more like a love autopsy. The couple starts off wanting an amicable split, but once the expensive lawyers are involved, every stray comment or innocent mistake is scrutinized and weaponized, the story of their marriage rewritten with each cast as the villain to the other. Baumbach's unflinching examination of the imploding union spares neither party, and Johansson and Driver's commitment to their characters is devastating.

The standup comic Ronny Chieng has a lot on his mind, including politics, civil liberties, immigration, consumerism, subway etiquette and wedding planning. But Chieng is at his most incisive when he's blowing up stereotypes: Why do Asian-American immigrants want their first-generation children to become doctors, but then neglect to see doctors themselves? What if Asian-Americans became the impartial referees of all disputes among other races? (""No hatred, just solutions."") And what would it be like if an Asian-American were voted into the White House? This leads to a very funny rant, but Chieng doesn't really seem to be joking. Who knows what Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger, then Pope Benedict XVI (Anthony Hopkins), and Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the future Pope Francis (Jonathan Pryce), might have said to each other in private meetings six years ago? In this film, the writer Anthony McCarten and the director Fernando Meirelles imagine that the these two very different churchmen -- one a conservative traditionalist, the other considered a more liberal reformer -- had a momentous dialogue that led to the resignation of one man and the ascension of the other. Discussed are issues of sexual abuse and financial malfeasance, and nothing less than the future of the Roman Catholic Church appears to at stake. Even though the movie is pure speculation, the discussion is riveting, and the master actors Hopkins and Pryce create the illusion of actually having it. Rom-coms have long celebrated stalking -- think Lloyd Dobler and his boombox in ""Say Anything."" The dark conceit of the psychosexual thriller ""You"" is that the obsessive protagonist, Joe Goldberg, sees himself as a romantic hero, despite being a serial killer. Following his Season 1 murder spree, Joe now needs a change of scenery. So for Season 2 he relocates to Los Angeles -- a town he hates, providing much fodder for his biting voice-over. The plot this time is largely derived from Caroline Kepnes' novel ""Hidden Bodies,"" the sequel to her ""You."" An unfortunately named woman, Love (played by Victoria Pedretti from ""The Haunting of Hill House""), comes into Joe's orbit as the bodies start dropping again. Could it be that Joe has finally met his soul mate? Or has he just met his match? The ""Austin Powers"" series, ""Malcolm X"" and ""Searching for Sugar Man.""

It's time to hit the road, as Midge Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan) embarks on her first tour, opening for the musician Shy Baldwin on a circuit that takes her from Las Vegas to Florida. Along for the ride, of course, is Midge's manager, Susie Myerson (Alex Borstein), who gets a crash course on contract negotiations. Though a great opportunity for Midge, the tour presents a number of problems, so insecurities are high, nerves are frayed and bad options start to look rather tempting. (It's Vegas, after all.)

Eleven-year-old Jonas Brodsky is both precocious and deaf, and he wants to play Beethoven's Sonata No. 14, a piece the great composer wrote as he was losing his own hearing. In this documentary, Jonas's mom, the filmmaker Irene Taylor Brodsky, combines real footage and animation to tell her son's story, exploring the aural world of a gifted child with cochlear implants. Brodsky's deaf father, Paul, who invented TTY, the first telecommunications device for the deaf, wonders if advances in genetics and technology might mean that ""there will be no deafness in the future.""

Theater,"Review: In 'Leopoldstadt,' Tom Stoppard Reckons With His Jewish Roots",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/theater/leopoldstadt-review-tom-stoppard.html,"LONDON -- Do you remember? Don't you remember? Can't you remember? Why can't you remember? Variations on those unsettling words -- both explicit and unspoken -- echo through the wrenching final scene of Tom Stoppard's ""Leopoldstadt,"" which opened Wednesday night at Wyndham's Theater in London. They are addressed to a mid-20th century visitor to Vienna, a youngish, defensively British man of slipping poise who appears to have forgotten most of his early childhood. But you could also argue that these questions have been posed, in a sustained murmur, from the very beginning of this richly embroidered portrait of Jewish life in Vienna in the early 20th century. They are questions aimed directly at us, the audience and, by extension, at a wider world conveniently prone to historical amnesia. That would include, above all, the man who wrote this play. A tone of instructional reproach is hardly a quality associated with Stoppard, whose six-decade career embraces a host of exuberantly cerebral plays, from ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"" (1967) to the time-traveling ""Arcadia"" (1993). But ""Leopoldstadt,"" which has been polished to a burnished sheen by the director Patrick Marber, holds a singular position in its author's canon. For starters, Stoppard, 82, has said this will probably be his last play. And, more than anything he has written (including his rueful ""The Real Thing""), ""Leopoldstadt"" feels like an act of personal reckoning for its creator -- with who he is and what he comes from. It's not difficult to see ""Leopoldstadt"" as one man's passionate declaration of identity as a Jew.

Judaism never figured conspicuously in Stoppard's earlier work. For much of his life, he never thought of himself as Jewish. Born Tomas Straussler in a small town in Czechoslovakia in 1937, he grew up largely in Britain, taking the name of Stoppard from the Englishman his mother married after his father's death. As Stoppard writes in program notes for the play, his mother rarely spoke of her own history. It was only when a previously unknown Czech relative made contact with him in the 1990s that he learned about his mother's family, many of whom had died during the Holocaust.

The image of a hand-printed family tree is prominent in ""Leopoldstadt,"" among the black-and-white projections and photographs that hover evanescently between scenes. For the record, it is not Stoppard's family that is portrayed in the play, but a prosperous fictional Austrian clan in Vienna. When the play begins, the family is assembled at the comfortably upholstered apartment occupied by the matriarchal Grandma Emilia Merz (Caroline Gruber) and her son, Hermann (Adrian Scarborough), who runs the family textile business. It is Christmas Day, 1899.

Yes, that holiday is being celebrated in this Jewish household, a commingling of traditions that finds droll expression when a child mistakenly tops the towering Christmas tree with a Star of David. For Hermann -- whose wife, Gretl (Faye Castelow), is Catholic -- cultural assimilation is a fait accompli as Austria moves into a new century. Or is it? The group assembled before us may represent a sort of cosmopolitan melting pot, in which conversation touches on the latest play by Schnitzler, the painting of Klimt (for whom Gretl is posing), higher mathematics and the theories of Freud. (This is a Stoppard play.) But as Hermann speaks of his hopes for future social and professional advancement, you sense insecurity pricking at his complacency (an uneasiness that is subtly and expertly conveyed by Scarborough, in the show's most fully realized portrait). That disquiet assumes dramatic form before the first act ends, when a romantic triangle -- or quadrangle, depending on how you look at it (again, this is a Stoppard play) -- forces anti-Semitic sentiment into the open. In the second act, with scenes set during the Depression that followed World War I and in 1938, on the eve of Austria's incorporation into the Third Reich, that sentiment festers into full-blown, terrifying form. Thus we watch the once-resplendent Merz household become increasingly shabby and bare, as what once felt like a familial fortress is transformed into a defenseless sanctuary. (Richard Hudson's artfully evolving set is lighted in a sepia haze by the masterly Neil Austin, and images of the entire clan, posed as if for posterity, become a heartbreaking motif.) We are introduced to new generations of Merzes (in changing-times costumes by Brigitte Reiffenstuel), whose political allegiances and cultural tastes vary widely. But being Jewish is no longer a choice for them, not in the age of National Socialism. Anyone with even a passing knowledge of European history will know what to expect when the family freezes at the sound of someone pounding on the door. That does not make watching what follows any easier. In the final scene, in 1955, a man we had earlier met as a boy returns to the now abandoned apartment. Played by Luke Thallon, he is a successful writer of comic literature and, as far as he knows, a proper Englishman. It seems safe to say that he is a surrogate for Stoppard.

More than any previous Stoppard play -- including the sprawling ""Coast of Utopia"" trilogy, a 9-hour dive into the Russian Revolution -- ""Leopoldstadt"" is a group portrait, and one of uncommon density. (You will probably feel the need to consult the family tree in the program.) The 40-strong cast is, to a person, very good, and they embody their characters with spiky defining detail. That they threaten to get lost in the play's panoramic sweep is partly the point here. But it is also hard to avoid the impression that they exist as illustrative figures in an admonitory history lesson. There's no denying that lesson's emotional power, nor its frightening relevance in 2020, when anti-Semitic acts and language seem increasingly on the rise. That means that although ""Leopoldstadt"" is set in the past, it is Stoppard's most topical play. It is also his most conventional drama by far. A writer who reliably bent time into pretzels in earlier works, Stoppard hews to a fully linear structure here. And while ""Leopoldstadt"" is replete, to the bursting point, with historical fact and political theory, it is mostly devoid of the intellectual jeux d'esprit that have been its creator's signature. This may be the Stoppard play for people who don't normally cotton to Stoppard. It is as if the playwright felt that what he had to say here was too urgent to be filtered through his usual cerebral playfulness. The unreliability of memory, an abiding Stoppardian concern, is briefly flirted with in the final scene. But ultimately, memory isn't the capricious, fragmenting prism of classic Stoppard. Here, recollection is a laser, a tool to be focused on a past teeming with harsh and essential lessons for the present. It seems fitting that, for once in a Stoppard work, words aren't what leave the most lasting impression. It is instead the vision of people frozen as if for a photograph, beckoning with poignantly immediate life from a distant time before they dissolve into anonymous darkness. ""Leopoldstadt"" demands, with gravity and eloquence, that we never let those visions disappear.","In what he says will probably be his last work, a master playwright finds urgent lessons for the present in the past of a Viennese family.",da8070be-edc1-5d6f-a78c-3962249598cc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/12/arts/leopoldstatd-review1/leopoldstatd-review1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=c8831ab05098bd9921d78c1bcff4a65dcd044efe7f61310de2beb700adefef4b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Adrian Scarborough, left, and Luke Thallon in Tom Stoppard's ""Leopoldstadt"" at Wyndham's Theater in London.",da8070be-edc1-5d6f-a78c-3962249598cc,Demo_data/D1_img2/1da8070be-edc1-5d6f-a78c-3962249598cc.jpg,10,"Review: In 'Leopoldstadt,' Tom Stoppard Reckons With His Jewish Roots LONDON -- Do you remember?

Don't you remember? Can't you remember? Why can't you remember? Variations on those unsettling words -- both explicit and unspoken -- echo through the wrenching final scene of Tom Stoppard's ""Leopoldstadt,"" which opened Wednesday night at Wyndham's Theater in London. They are addressed to a mid-20th century visitor to Vienna, a youngish, defensively British man of slipping poise who appears to have forgotten most of his early childhood. But you could also argue that these questions have been posed, in a sustained murmur, from the very beginning of this richly embroidered portrait of Jewish life in Vienna in the early 20th century. They are questions aimed directly at us, the audience and, by extension, at a wider world conveniently prone to historical amnesia. That would include, above all, the man who wrote this play. A tone of instructional reproach is hardly a quality associated with Stoppard, whose six-decade career embraces a host of exuberantly cerebral plays, from ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"" (1967) to the time-traveling ""Arcadia"" (1993). But ""Leopoldstadt,"" which has been polished to a burnished sheen by the director Patrick Marber, holds a singular position in its author's canon. For starters, Stoppard, 82, has said this will probably be his last play. And, more than anything he has written (including his rueful ""The Real Thing""), ""Leopoldstadt"" feels like an act of personal reckoning for its creator -- with who he is and what he comes from. It's not difficult to see ""Leopoldstadt"" as one man's passionate declaration of identity as a Jew.

Judaism never figured conspicuously in Stoppard's earlier work. For much of his life, he never thought of himself as Jewish. Born Tomas Straussler in a small town in Czechoslovakia in 1937, he grew up largely in Britain, taking the name of Stoppard from the Englishman his mother married after his father's death. As Stoppard writes in program notes for the play, his mother rarely spoke of her own history. It was only when a previously unknown Czech relative made contact with him in the 1990s that he learned about his mother's family, many of whom had died during the Holocaust.

The image of a hand-printed family tree is prominent in ""Leopoldstadt,"" among the black-and-white projections and photographs that hover evanescently between scenes. For the record, it is not Stoppard's family that is portrayed in the play, but a prosperous fictional Austrian clan in Vienna. When the play begins, the family is assembled at the comfortably upholstered apartment occupied by the matriarchal Grandma Emilia Merz (Caroline Gruber) and her son, Hermann (Adrian Scarborough), who runs the family textile business. It is Christmas Day, 1899.

Yes, that holiday is being celebrated in this Jewish household, a commingling of traditions that finds droll expression when a child mistakenly tops the towering Christmas tree with a Star of David. For Hermann -- whose wife, Gretl (Faye Castelow), is Catholic -- cultural assimilation is a fait accompli as Austria moves into a new century. Or is it? The group assembled before us may represent a sort of cosmopolitan melting pot, in which conversation touches on the latest play by Schnitzler, the painting of Klimt (for whom Gretl is posing), higher mathematics and the theories of Freud. (This is a Stoppard play.) But as Hermann speaks of his hopes for future social and professional advancement, you sense insecurity pricking at his complacency (an uneasiness that is subtly and expertly conveyed by Scarborough, in the show's most fully realized portrait). That disquiet assumes dramatic form before the first act ends, when a romantic triangle -- or quadrangle, depending on how you look at it (again, this is a Stoppard play) -- forces anti-Semitic sentiment into the open. In the second act, with scenes set during the Depression that followed World War I and in 1938, on the eve of Austria's incorporation into the Third Reich, that sentiment festers into full-blown, terrifying form. Thus we watch the once-resplendent Merz household become increasingly shabby and bare, as what once felt like a familial fortress is transformed into a defenseless sanctuary. (Richard Hudson's artfully evolving set is lighted in a sepia haze by the masterly Neil Austin, and images of the entire clan, posed as if for posterity, become a heartbreaking motif.) We are introduced to new generations of Merzes (in changing-times costumes by Brigitte Reiffenstuel), whose political allegiances and cultural tastes vary widely. But being Jewish is no longer a choice for them, not in the age of National Socialism. Anyone with even a passing knowledge of European history will know what to expect when the family freezes at the sound of someone pounding on the door. That does not make watching what follows any easier. In the final scene, in 1955, a man we had earlier met as a boy returns to the now abandoned apartment. Played by Luke Thallon, he is a successful writer of comic literature and, as far as he knows, a proper Englishman. It seems safe to say that he is a surrogate for Stoppard.

More than any previous Stoppard play -- including the sprawling ""Coast of Utopia"" trilogy, a 9-hour dive into the Russian Revolution -- ""Leopoldstadt"" is a group portrait, and one of uncommon density. (You will probably feel the need to consult the family tree in the program.) The 40-strong cast is, to a person, very good, and they embody their characters with spiky defining detail. That they threaten to get lost in the play's panoramic sweep is partly the point here. But it is also hard to avoid the impression that they exist as illustrative figures in an admonitory history lesson. There's no denying that lesson's emotional power, nor its frightening relevance in 2020, when anti-Semitic acts and language seem increasingly on the rise. That means that although ""Leopoldstadt"" is set in the past, it is Stoppard's most topical play. It is also his most conventional drama by far. A writer who reliably bent time into pretzels in earlier works, Stoppard hews to a fully linear structure here. And while ""Leopoldstadt"" is replete, to the bursting point, with historical fact and political theory, it is mostly devoid of the intellectual jeux d'esprit that have been its creator's signature. This may be the Stoppard play for people who don't normally cotton to Stoppard. It is as if the playwright felt that what he had to say here was too urgent to be filtered through his usual cerebral playfulness. The unreliability of memory, an abiding Stoppardian concern, is briefly flirted with in the final scene. But ultimately, memory isn't the capricious, fragmenting prism of classic Stoppard. Here, recollection is a laser, a tool to be focused on a past teeming with harsh and essential lessons for the present. It seems fitting that, for once in a Stoppard work, words aren't what leave the most lasting impression. It is instead the vision of people frozen as if for a photograph, beckoning with poignantly immediate life from a distant time before they dissolve into anonymous darkness. ""Leopoldstadt"" demands, with gravity and eloquence, that we never let those visions disappear. In what he says will probably be his last work, a master playwright finds urgent lessons for the present in the past of a Viennese family.",10,['10'],10
Food,"A Savory, Tender Gnocchi Poised for Success",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/dining/ricotta-gnocchi-dumpling-recipe.html,"Gnocchi, those savory little dumplings, are frequently offered as a first course in Italian restaurants, as an alternative to a pasta course. Other times, a larger portion may make a fine hot lunch, or just a few gnocchi can round out a main course, sidled up to a saucy braised veal shank. The secret to making magnificent tender gnocchi at home is the same as the old joke about how to get to Carnegie Hall: practice, practice, practice.

This is especially true with potato gnocchi; a beginner's attempts usually produce tough, chewy specimens. Overhandled dough and too much added flour may be the culprits, but in truth, there is a learning curve. Expertise is achieved only by repetition, until you acquire the feel for it.

There are, however, many other kinds of traditional Italian gnocchi that don't use potatoes at all. Gnocchi alla romana, for example, is a golden, crisp-topped baked dish made with slices of cooked semolina splashed with cream, butter and cheese. That kind is easier to execute.

And most home cooks can find success making ricotta gnocchi, which, when at their best, can be exceedingly light and delicate (and still pretty darned good even when they're not completely perfect). Essentially, they are made from ricotta and eggs, a touch of Parmesan and a handful of flour. Good, fresh ricotta is critical. Use the very best you can find, typically available at any good Italian deli or well-stocked cheese shops. (The grainy low-fat commercial type doesn't qualify here.) Drain your ricotta well before making the recipe, or the dough will be too wet. Put it in a fine mesh sieve set over a bowl, for several hours or overnight. You will be surprised by how much liquid whey seeps out. I sometimes drink a glass of it (it makes a pleasant beverage and is known to be highly nutritious) or save it to use in soups or smoothies.

When mixing the dough for ricotta gnocchi -- it's really more like a stiff batter -- add the least amount of flour possible. The ethereal custardy ricotta gnocchi served at Zuni Cafe in San Francisco have no flour at all, and the dough must be dropped by the spoonful into simmering water. Those are the lightest ricotta dumplings I know.

But I learned in Italy that adding a small amount ( 1/4  to  1/2  cup) of all-purpose flour to the dough and using fine semolina flour for dusting the work surface makes it possible to roll the dough into long ropes. Use scissors to snip the ropes into gnocchi shapes. I like to let the shaped gnocchi rest on a semolina-dusted baking sheet for an hour before cooking them, but it's fine to skip that step. Ricotta gnocchi are wonderful served in broth or with a light tomato sauce. Another classic preparation has them swimming in butter with sage leaves. But my latest favorite version is to sauce them with a simple parsley pesto, and to finish with a shower of chopped pistachios and Parmesan. These feathery dumplings, with the herbal tang of parsley pesto, call for a penetrating white wine that will cut through their richness but won't be too sharp. The options are many. Fianos from Campania would be delicious, as would good Soaves. If you can find a decent vernaccia di San Gimignano, that would be fine. French wines would be terrific, particularly aligotes from Burgundy and Muscadets from the Atlantic. Vermentinos from Liguria or Corsica would also work well. If you prefer a red, basic Chianti is the choice.

Media,Donald Trump Elicits Shock and Biting Satire in European Media,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/29/business/media/donald-trump-elicits-shock-and-biting-satire-in-europe.html,"LONDON -- He has been depicted as a snarling demagogue in France, equated with Donald Duck in Spain, and described as worse than Lord Voldemort in Britain. In Europe, the birthplace of the Enlightenment, Donald Trump has been treated variously as a disturbing curiosity or an entertaining political show barker. His nearly every move and pronouncement has been reported from Paris to Berlin to Helsinki, even as commentators on both left and right have dismissed the notion of President Donald J. Trump as the stuff of fantasy, or, at worst, a momentary lapse of reason. That is changing. With a series of wins in key Republican primary states, and with the billionaire's expected strong showing when 12 states hold primaries or caucuses on Tuesday, the European media, like its American counterpart, is adjusting to the prospect of a seemingly unstoppable Trump juggernaut. The reaction is a mix of befuddlement, outrage and panic, along with admiration in some unlikely quarters. And satire. The Spanish newspaper El Pais recently published an imaginary letter from the grave in which Philip II, a 16th-century Spanish king who ruled a vast empire, offers advice to Mr. Trump. Noting that his nation had also suffered from roguish subjects demanding free handouts, and Muslim terrorists masquerading as peaceful citizens, the king advises Mr. Trump to ""consider bringing back the Inquisition.""

Mr. Trump's often scowling face appears frequently on front pages, his success parsed daily on news bulletins and radio talk shows. Coverage tends to focus on his more outrageous statements rather than much serious examination of how a Trump presidency -- still regarded with horror by many -- might affect international diplomacy. Hillary Clinton's name recognition and star power still fascinate, as does the surprising ascent of her Democratic rival, Bernie Sanders. But Mr. Trump is stealing most of the headlines. Jakob Nielsen, the online editor and former Washington bureau chief of Politiken, an influential Danish newspaper, said that initially editors there did not take Mr. Trump's candidacy seriously, and were disbelieving when the paper's United States correspondents started filing articles saying he might win the Republican nomination. ""As Trump has risen and as he has won the first primaries, the coverage has gone from fascination to outrage,"" he said in a phone interview from Copenhagen.

The incredulous husband tells his wife: ""This is too unreal. Can we watch something more realistic like 'Star Wars'?""

Mr. Trump's toxic irreverence has helped fan the criticism. He drew the ire of the press -- and officials in London and Paris -- after he described neighborhoods in their cities as no-go zones for police. In Britain, his widely reported comments that foreign Muslims should not be allowed to enter the United States provoked such outrage that members of Parliament debated a petition, signed by more than 580,000 people, to ban him from entering the country. (He can still visit.)

A commentary in Bild, a populist German tabloid, recently noted that most Germans could not say who was running in the German state elections in March, but they were following the election campaign in ""distant"" America. For all the provocations by Mr. Trump, his deftness at tapping into the visceral anger of Americans shaken by economic doldrums and globalization has deep resonance in Europe, where citizens from Britain to France to Hungary have also turned to insurgent politicians on the far right or the far left to express disgust with the political mainstream. Jaroslav Plesl, the editor of Mlada fronta Dnes, a leading Czech newspaper, said in an interview that Mr. Trump's willingness to take on the political establishment, even in his own party, had made him a folk hero of sorts in Eastern and Central Europe among people who were disillusioned with the post-1989 political order. Equating Mr. Trump's appeal to that of Ronald Reagan, he argued that the candidate was drawing in fans with his showmanship and swagger. ""The elites in Prague will sneer at him for being dumb and a bad role model, but Czechs in general like underdogs and outsiders like Trump,"" he said.

""There is a sense of shock here after we have seen Trump rallies with almost fascistlike rhetoric."" Reflecting that disbelief, a cartoon in Politiken last week showed a couple on a sofa watching a CNN report asking ""Will Trump make it all the way?"" The incredulous husband tells his wife: ""This is too unreal. Can we watch something more realistic like 'Star Wars'?""

Mr. Trump's toxic irreverence has helped fan the criticism. He drew the ire of the press -- and officials in London and Paris -- after he described neighborhoods in their cities as no-go zones for police. In Britain, his widely reported comments that foreign Muslims should not be allowed to enter the United States provoked such outrage that members of Parliament debated a petition, signed by more than 580,000 people, to ban him from entering the country. (He can still visit.)

A commentary in Bild, a populist German tabloid, recently noted that most Germans could not say who was running in the German state elections in March, but they were following the election campaign in ""distant"" America. For all the provocations by Mr. Trump, his deftness at tapping into the visceral anger of Americans shaken by economic doldrums and globalization has deep resonance in Europe, where citizens from Britain to France to Hungary have also turned to insurgent politicians on the far right or the far left to express disgust with the political mainstream. Jaroslav Plesl, the editor of Mlada fronta Dnes, a leading Czech newspaper, said in an interview that Mr. Trump's willingness to take on the political establishment, even in his own party, had made him a folk hero of sorts in Eastern and Central Europe among people who were disillusioned with the post-1989 political order. Equating Mr. Trump's appeal to that of Ronald Reagan, he argued that the candidate was drawing in fans with his showmanship and swagger. ""The elites in Prague will sneer at him for being dumb and a bad role model, but Czechs in general like underdogs and outsiders like Trump,"" he said. ""To many young people who worship American popular culture, Trump signifies American values like show business, and working hard to achieve success.""

Others in the European news media, however, have expressed shock at Mr. Trump's brand of incendiary politics, in particular the insults he has lobbed at minorities, Muslims, Mexicans, women and the handicapped. Europe has its own brand of immigrant-baiting far-right figures, from Marine Le Pen of the National Front in France to Nigel Farage of the U.K. Independence Party. Mr. Trump enjoys greater popularity in Russia, where the budding bromance between the American and President Vladimir V. Putin has won him praise. The news channel Russia Today, or RT, paid homage to Mr. Trump's talents as a shock jock, and published an interactive article ""on the top ways to be offensive -- Trump-style."" Among the insults highlighted was Mr. Trump's off-color attack on the former Representative Barney Frank, referring to what Mr. Trump called his ""protruding nipples."" ""Love him or hate him, the Republican has an uncanny ability to elicit an explosive response whenever he gets near a keyboard,"" said the broadcaster, which is funded by the Kremlin. Adding to Mr. Trump's fans in Europe, Ms. Le Pen's father Jean-Marie Le Pen, former leader of the National Front, wrote on Twitter on Saturday: ""If I were American, I'd vote Donald Trump ... but God bless him!"" Mr. Le Pen, 87, has been convicted several times of inciting racial hatred. By contrast, the left-leaning French newspaper Liberation expressed puzzlement at Mr. Trump's ascent. Under the headline ""Trump, From Nightmare to Reality,"" it recently noted that there appeared to be nothing to stop Mr. Trump from winning the Republican nomination. ""And this, despite his thundering racist and sexist declarations."" Once dismissive of Mr. Trump's presidential candidacy, European news media are adjusting to the prospect of a seemingly unstoppable Trump juggernaut.",16,['16'],16
Technology,"Apple, Google and a Deal That Controls the Internet",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/25/technology/apple-google-search-antitrust.html,"OAKLAND, Calif. -- When Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, the chief executives of Apple and Google, were photographed eating dinner together in 2017 at an upscale Vietnamese restaurant called Tamarine, the picture set off a tabloid-worthy frenzy about the relationship between the two most powerful companies in Silicon Valley. As the two men sipped red wine at a window table inside the restaurant in Palo Alto, their companies were in tense negotiations to renew one of the most lucrative business deals in history: an agreement to feature Google's search engine as the preselected choice on Apple's iPhone and other devices. The updated deal was worth billions of dollars to both companies and cemented their status at the top of the tech industry's pecking order. Now, the partnership is in jeopardy. Last Tuesday, the Justice Department filed a landmark lawsuit against Google -- the U.S. government's biggest antitrust case in two decades -- and homed in on the alliance as a prime example of what prosecutors say are the company's illegal tactics to protect its monopoly and choke off competition in web search.

""We have this sort of strange term in Silicon Valley: co-opetition,"" said Bruce Sewell, Apple's general counsel from 2009 to 2017. ""You have brutal competition, but at the same time, you have necessary cooperation."" Apple and Google are joined at the hip even though Mr. Cook has said internet advertising, Google's bread and butter, engages in ""surveillance"" of consumers and even though Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder, once promised ""thermonuclear war"" on his Silicon Valley neighbor when he learned it was working on a rival to the iPhone. Apple and Google's parent company, Alphabet, worth more than $3 trillion combined, do compete on plenty of fronts, like smartphones, digital maps and laptops. But they also know how to make nice when it suits their interests. And few deals have been nicer to both sides of the table than the iPhone search deal. Nearly half of Google's search traffic now comes from Apple devices, according to the Justice Department, and the prospect of losing the Apple deal has been described as a ""code red"" scenario inside the company. When iPhone users search on Google, they see the search ads that drive Google's business. They can also find their way to other Google products, like YouTube.

A former Google executive, who asked not to be identified because he was not permitted to talk about the deal, said the prospect of losing Apple's traffic was ""terrifying"" to the company. The Justice Department, which is asking for a court injunction preventing Google from entering into deals like the one it made with Apple, argues that the arrangement has unfairly helped make Google, which handles 92 percent of the world's internet searches, the center of consumers' online lives. Online businesses like Yelp and Expedia, as well as companies ranging from noodle shops to news organizations, often complain that Google's search domination enables it to charge advertising fees when people simply look up their names, as well as to steer consumers toward its own products, like Google Maps. Microsoft, which had its own antitrust battle two decades ago, has told British regulators that if it were the default option on iPhones and iPads, it would make more advertising money for every search on its rival search engine, Bing. What's more, competitors like DuckDuckGo, a small search engine that sells itself as a privacy-focused alternative to Google, could never match Google's tab with Apple. Apple now receives an estimated $8 billion to $12 billion in annual payments -- up from $1 billion a year in 2014 -- in exchange for building Google's search engine into its products. It is probably the single biggest payment that Google makes to anyone and accounts for 14 to 21 percent of Apple's annual profits. That's not money Apple would be eager to walk away from. In fact, Mr. Cook and Mr. Pichai met again in 2018 to discuss how they could increase revenue from search. After the meeting, a senior Apple employee wrote to a Google counterpart that ""our vision is that we work as if we are one company,"" according to the Justice Department's complaint. A forced breakup could mean the loss of easy money to Apple. But it would be a more significant threat to Google, which would have no obvious way to replace the lost traffic. It could also push Apple to acquire or build its own search engine. Within Google, people believe that Apple is one of the few companies in the world that could offer a formidable alternative, according to one former executive. Google has also worried that without the agreement, Apple could make it more difficult for iPhone users to get to the Google search engine.

A spokesman for Apple declined to comment on the partnership, while a Google spokesman pointed to a blog post in which the company defended the relationship. Even though its bill with Apple keeps going up, Google has said again and again that it dominates internet search because consumers prefer it, not because it is buying customers. The company argues that the Justice Department is painting an incomplete picture; its partnership with Apple, it says, is no different than Coca-Cola paying a supermarket for prominent shelf space. Other search engines like Microsoft's Bing also have revenue-sharing agreements with Apple to appear as secondary search options on iPhones, Google says in its defense. It adds that Apple allows people to change their default search engine from Google -- though few probably do because people typically don't tinker with such settings and many prefer Google anyway. Apple has rarely, if ever, publicly acknowledged its deal with Google, and according to Bernstein Research, has mentioned its so-called licensing revenue in an earnings call for the first time this year. According to a former senior executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality contracts, Apple's leaders have made the same calculation about Google as much of the general public: The utility of its search engine is worth the cost of its invasive practices. ""Their search engine is the best,"" Mr. Cook said when asked by Axios in late 2018 why he partnered with a company he also implicitly criticized. He added that Apple had also created ways to blunt Google's collection of data, such as a private-browsing mode on Apple's internet browser. The deal is not limited to searches in Apple's Safari browser; it extends to virtually all searches done on Apple devices, including with Apple's virtual assistant, Siri, and on Google's iPhone app and Chrome browser.

In 2005, Apple and Google inked what at the time seemed like a modest deal: Google would be the default search engine on Apple's Safari browser on Mac computers. Quickly, Mr. Cook, then still a deputy to Mr. Jobs, saw the arrangement's lucrative potential, according to another former senior Apple executive who asked not to be named. Google's payments were pure profit, and all Apple had to do was feature a search engine its users already wanted. Apple expanded the deal for its big upcoming product: the iPhone. When Mr. Jobs unveiled the iPhone in 2007, he invited Eric Schmidt, Google's then chief executive, to join him onstage for the first of Apple's many famous iPhone events. ""If we just sort of merged the two companies, we could just call them AppleGoo,"" joked Mr. Schmidt, who was also on Apple's board of directors. With Google search on the iPhone, he added, ""you can actually merge without merging."" Then the relationship soured. Google had quietly been developing a competitor to the iPhone: smartphone software called Android that any phone maker could use. Mr. Jobs was furious. In 2010, Apple sued a phone maker that used Android. ""I'm going to destroy Android,"" Mr. Jobs told his biographer, Walter Isaacson. ""I will spend my last dying breath if I need to.""","In a landmark antitrust complaint, the Justice Department is targeting a secretive partnership that is worth billions of dollars to both companies.",da1996b0-46fc-5d47-b06f-8c0be9deaa95,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/25/business/25applegoogle/merlin_16520613_782fdb1d-b33b-4d7e-8b5c-43c961e3df14-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=7eeeb1e05ded3884ff66f030bf45efa17872d3d6647566bb0942f98bd5426c42&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"In 2007, Steve Jobs, left, Apple's co-founder, invited Google's chief executive, Eric Schmidt, to join him to explain how Google would work on the iPhone.",da1996b0-46fc-5d47-b06f-8c0be9deaa95,Demo_data/D1_img2/1da1996b0-46fc-5d47-b06f-8c0be9deaa95.jpg,20,"Apple, Google and a Deal That Controls the Internet OAKLAND, Calif. -- When Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai, the chief executives of Apple and Google, were photographed eating dinner together in 2017 at an upscale Vietnamese restaurant called Tamarine, the picture set off a tabloid-worthy frenzy about the relationship between the two most powerful companies in Silicon Valley.

Food,What to Cook This Week,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/25/dining/what-to-cook-this-week.html,"Sam Sifton emails readers of Cooking five days a week to talk about food and suggest recipes. That email also appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. Good morning. Ramadan is ending, and Muslims across the globe will be celebrating Eid al-Fitr, a feast celebrating the end of the monthlong fast. Whatever your faith, today might be a good one to make David Tanis's recipe for Moroccan lamb, accompanied by Julia Moskin's recipe for cucumber-yogurt salad with sour cherries and rose petals and, perhaps, Melissa Clark's recipe for pistachio baklava for dessert. Tomorrow, you can serve leftovers, the lamb shredded and served warm over triangles of pita bread with the last of the salad - a kind of nacho situation, and a beautiful start to the week. For a Tuesday night meal, you could cut Tejal Rao's recipe for Somali-style rice in half for a fine and substantial vegetarian meal, or quick-brine some fish for the grill, guide-style.

Automobiles,A Truck Tailgate Party: Fire Up the Grilles,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/automobiles/tailgate-party-fire-up-the-grilles.html,"The look of its pickup trucks is so important that General Motors put its best man on the job: the guy who does the Corvettes. Fresh from the task of designing the 2014 Stingray, Tom Peters took on the task of freshening up -- and toughening up -- the Chevrolet Silverado and its fraternal twin, the GMC Sierra. ""A fist in the wind"" is how Mr. Peters describes the pickups' design. The new G.M. trucks are not alone in looking as if they can deliver a punch. The latest full-size pickups from G.M.'s crosstown rivals, Ford and Ram, step into the ring with flattened noses, their huge, blunt grilles often slathered in bright trim. A special edition of the latest Toyota Tundra seems to have as many bars as Milwaukee, capped with a flat, wide nostril. ""There is a trend toward a bigger, bolder look,"" said Mr. Peters, the director of exterior design for Chevrolet trucks, full-size crossovers and performance cars. Automobile grilles have long been carefully created to reflect the image of their brands and a particular model's place in the hierarchy, while truck grilles were comparatively bare and basic. But with trucks locked in ever-fiercer sales battles, their grilles have grown larger and more eye-catching, a modern, motorized riff on the battle shields of medieval crusaders.

After taking a hit when the economy slumped, pickup sales are on the rise again on the strength of a rebounding construction industry: Ram (previously known as Dodge Trucks) gained 49 percent in April from a year earlier, and the full-size truck sales of G.M. and Ford each rose around 24 percent. Manufacturers are scrambling to grab larger shares of this highly profitable market with tougher, more distinctive designs. Rugged exteriors help to hide the fact that many of today's macho-looking trucks are softies on the inside, with interiors wrapped in soft leather, decked with wood trim and buzzing with electronic gadgets. Luxury trucks are especially hot. Ford says that about a third of its pickup sales come from the higher-end versions priced at $35,000 or more. Not long ago, a $50,000 pickup seemed unimaginable. Now the price tags on fancy trucks can rise well above $60,000. In addition, a tough grille can obscure the fact that the power plant behind it is shrinking -- with more fuel-efficient V-6 engines replacing thirsty V-8s in many pickup trucks.

In Texas, where one-sixth of the nation's pickups are sold, and where Mr. Peters showed off his new truck to the press recently, pickups are like the standard uniform of boots and cowboy hats: they are everywhere, but they come in many styles and shapes. Greater personalization, with a variety of available faces, is the latest truck trend. The image of the pickup truck is firmly wrapped in American mythology. Model names read like the listings for John Wayne Week on the Turner Classic Movies channel: High Country, King Ranch, Laramie Longhorn. Manufacturers present trucks primarily as work tools, but despite the ads featuring cowboys, farmers and construction workers, more and more trucks are being used partly -- or mostly -- as family vehicles. ""There's a lot of diversity in the customer range,"" said Joe Dehner, chief exterior designer for Ram and Dodge. In addition to working trucks, he said, ""we also get the 'air haulers,' which means they don't necessarily carry something."" For decades, trucks looked like basic metal boxes. Then Dodge offered up a bold new look for its Ram for the 1994 model year. Under Tom Gale, then the design chief for Chrysler, the pickup added a touch of fantasy to the utilitarian box. With its arched grille and raised hood, the Ram resembled the cab of a mighty 18-wheeler. Today's Ram designers call it ""the big-rig look,"" said Mr. Dehner. ""We own that."" But pickups from other manufacturers began to show the Ram's influence as their designers visually separated the hood and fenders and raised the grille above the headlights.

The perennial best-selling pickup, the Ford F-150, was last redesigned for 2009. But today's F-150 wears many faces: depending on the model or trim level, the grille has multiple small bars or large planks of chrome along with different shapes and colors of meshlike patterns. The Atlas concept truck, unveiled in January at the Detroit auto show, appears to borrow the muscular look of Ford's Super Duty line of larger, more powerful pickups. The Atlas is believed to foreshadow the design of the next-generation F-150, expected next year. The face of the Atlas adds vertical elements to the horizontal bars of the current F-150. The grille's frame forms a shape that suggests the nostrils of a bull. Toyota's new design for its big Tundra truck, first displayed at the Chicago auto show in February, was devised at the Calty design studio in California. The Tundra's grille frame has also been enlarged and its designers, too, use words like bold, chiseled and tough. In one sign of how much truck grilles have grown, the Nissan Titan's, which seemed notably aggressive when the truck made its debut as a 2004 model, looks relatively undersized in comparison with the newer designs of its rivals. Grilles play a critical role in differentiating the many submodels and trim levels of today's trucks. ""It is almost mind-boggling how complex the choices have become,"" Mr. Peters said.

Ford offers a huge choice of variants with its F-150, visually distinguishing a range from base models to King Ranch and Harley-Davidson editions, Special and Platinum luxury versions and the high-performance SVT Raptor, with huge letters molded into a black front end that Ford calls a ""brick wall grille."" Mr. Dehner, the Ram designer, said: ""There has been an explosion of different textures and finishes, not just in the grilles but with colors, wheels and trim packages. People want their vehicle to be customizable. It goes from the country to the urban cowboy and, if you will, the city slicker type. We want to be specific to their needs."" The Ram 1500 comes in nine trim levels and offers four basic types of grille mesh. There is a ""hex-link"" design on the Tradesman, Express and SLT models, with six-sided cells that provide ""the metaphor of the bolt head,"" Mr. Dehner said. The upscale Laramie has a similar ""hex-perf"" grille, in chrome. Then there are two versions of ""billet-perf"" on the Big Horn and Sport. ""It goes with a monochromatic look, big wheels, a hot-rod look,"" he said. The top-of-the-line Laramie Longhorn offers ""wave-mesh"" texture, a diamond wire pattern that dates to sports cars of the 1920s. ""It is an adaptation of the wire mesh grilles on upscale sport utilities,"" Mr. Dehner said. Aerodynamics, surprisingly, may be behind some of the rugged, angular faces of trucks. As boxy as they look, all the trucks are carefully tested in wind tunnels. The fist in the wind must be streamlined: Chevrolet says it has cut aerodynamic drag by 5 percent from the previous Silverado. ""Sometimes the design goes against what you assume is good for aero,"" said Gordon Platto of Ford, who directed the design of the Atlas concept truck. Crisp, clean lines on the sides and rear of a truck reduce drag. But in front, the Atlas has adjustable grille shutters, which close at higher speeds to reduce drag. The Ram trucks already have such a system, as do some passenger cars.","With trucks locked in ever-fiercer sales battles, their grilles have grown larger and more eye-catching, like modern, motorized battle shields.",dd12af87-4c86-5db5-a1f4-b3a8c48c623a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/19/automobiles/Grills2/Grills2-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=409&w=600&s=8381084817835bdca7f2e063c6a6efb3f67d2095663178467ef047e8b13111a0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"BLUNT FORCE DRAMA The 2014 Chevrolet Silverado LTZ, one of latest crop of in-your-face pickup trucks.",dd12af87-4c86-5db5-a1f4-b3a8c48c623a,Demo_data/D1_img2/1dd12af87-4c86-5db5-a1f4-b3a8c48c623a.jpg,23,"A Truck Tailgate Party: Fire Up the Grilles The look of its pickup trucks is so important that General Motors put its best man on the job: the guy who does the Corvettes.

People want their vehicle to be customizable. It goes from the country to the urban cowboy and, if you will, the city slicker type. We want to be specific to their needs."" The Ram 1500 comes in nine trim levels and offers four basic types of grille mesh. There is a ""hex-link"" design on the Tradesman, Express and SLT models, with six-sided cells that provide ""the metaphor of the bolt head,"" Mr. Dehner said. The upscale Laramie has a similar ""hex-perf"" grille, in chrome. Then there are two versions of ""billet-perf"" on the Big Horn and Sport. ""It goes with a monochromatic look, big wheels, a hot-rod look,"" he said. The top-of-the-line Laramie Longhorn offers ""wave-mesh"" texture, a diamond wire pattern that dates to sports cars of the 1920s. ""It is an adaptation of the wire mesh grilles on upscale sport utilities,"" Mr. Dehner said. Aerodynamics, surprisingly, may be behind some of the rugged, angular faces of trucks. As boxy as they look, all the trucks are carefully tested in wind tunnels. The fist in the wind must be streamlined: Chevrolet says it has cut aerodynamic drag by 5 percent from the previous Silverado. ""Sometimes the design goes against what you assume is good for aero,"" said Gordon Platto of Ford, who directed the design of the Atlas concept truck. Crisp, clean lines on the sides and rear of a truck reduce drag. But in front, the Atlas has adjustable grille shutters, which close at higher speeds to reduce drag. The Ram trucks already have such a system, as do some passenger cars. With trucks locked in ever-fiercer sales battles, their grilles have grown larger and more eye-catching, like modern, motorized battle shields.",23,['23'],23

Still, the pages turn more heavily here than they did in his last two books, ""Leaving the Sea"" (2014) and ""The Flame Alphabet"" (2012) -- which, by the way, were not exactly Disney on Ice.

This is not to say that Marcus is wrong about people, or about the creepy ""Black Mirror"" episode that's become our lives. There's a small, raw moment in the beautifully unnerving opening story, ""Cold Little Bird,"" that distills the book's cautionary howl. A 10-year-old named Jonah has made a chilling announcement to his parents: He no longer loves them or requires their oversight and, if they so much as hug him, he'll report them to the school therapist for unwanted touching. Jonah's father, Martin, is terrified -- both for his boy and himself. Like virtually every couple in the book, he and his wife are post-passion and nearly post-verbal. ""You'll die, without affection,"" Martin tells his son. ""I'm not kidding. You will actually dry up and die."" ""Notes From the Fog"" is about people so alienated that they're not so much living together as standing on adjacent ice floes.

There was a time when the words ""dystopian"" and ""futuristic"" were nearly synonyms, but even the most alarming events in Marcus's genre-roaming book seem no more than five minutes from now. In ""The Grow-Light Blues,"" Carl Hirsch's craven employers choose him to test a product that would replace meals with nutrient-infused rays from a laptop. The admiration and gratitude of his co-workers fade quickly and the light that's ""slowly roasting Carl's face"" transforms him into a monster to be pitied, shunned, fired. In ""Precious Precious,"" a cubicle worker named Ida Grieve is prescribed an insane-sounding antidepressant, called Rally, which is nearly impossible to swallow, then sits undigested in her stomach like a bomb waiting to go off: ""Soon it had risen back into her mouth -- it felt like a small insect crawling up her throat -- and she had to take it out and butter it again."" All the while, Ida is visiting her aging parents as their minds decay. When her mother fears that she's talking gibberish, she takes Ida's hand and -- in another tiny exchange that evokes a larger quest for connection -- says urgently, ""I made sense, didn't I? ...

Books,"For Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Nearly 100, the Beat Goes On",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/books/review/lawrence-ferlinghetti-greatest-poems.html,"Yeah, O.K. -- but what about his writing? The release of ""Ferlinghetti's Greatest Poems"" (I wish New Directions had gone ahead and called it ""Ferlinghetti's Greatest Hits,"" like an album full of ear candy by Tom Petty or Elton John) gives us a chance to revisit that question. It's a complicated one. Do the quicksilver qualities that can make Ferlinghetti's poetry so captivating to an adolescent undermine our ability to take it seriously with the passing of years? In his more unfortunate moments, as in the poem called ""Underwear,"" corny humor lands with a clank and you can't help wincing: ""Underwear can really get you in a bind / Negroes often wear / white underwear / which may lead to trouble.""

It seems self-evident that the passing of years has done ""Underwear"" no favors. At the same time, it would be churlish to deny that Ferlinghetti has given the popular canon many indelible lines. For a while in the 1950s and 1960s, his voice stood out amid a mounting dissident chorus; in these days of hashtagged political resistance, it is not uncommon to come across portions of his stanzas reconstituted as memes on Instagram and Facebook:

Based on passages like that, it's not much of a stretch to put Ferlinghetti in the company of skilled songwriters. He knows how to craft a hook. His lines have an easy, welcoming flow. (In this book, the poems are arranged chronologically and fluidly, as if they were part of an ""Abbey Road""-like symphonic collage or a Hollywood highlight reel.) He has a gift for helping you hear what needs to be said, free of impenetrable filters. He is allergic to willful obscurity and ""our little literary games,"" as he declared in one ""Howl""-referencing populist manifesto that he titled, with characteristic directness, ""Populist Manifesto No. 1"":

Returning to Ferlinghetti is ultimately about returning to the romantic associations of the milieu that produced Ferlinghetti, so it makes sense that some of Ferlinghetti's most plangent stanzas are the ones in which he looks back at the heyday of the Beats, that ""rebel band who / rose over the rooftops of / tenement boneyards / intent on making out / And made out of madness / a hundred years of beatitude."" Maybe there's no way to dissociate Ferlinghetti's poetry from the nostalgic gauze of various North Beach beatnik tropes -- proto-hipsters wearing berets and listening to bebop and smoking French cigarettes, etc. -- but what remains intact in the poems (even as their creator approaches a century of living) is the fresh, youthful energy of that moment. The liberating pulse can still be pretty contagious. His high points are the poems that you wish you could listen to in a car, on a long coastal highway, with the windows rolled down -- and you certainly can't say that about Robert Lowell.

Does the occasionally tossed-off imperfection of the poems give them a kind of time-capsuled charm? If you're willing as a reader to be forgiving, it can be a blast to go back to the way the words bounce. And Ferlinghetti himself can't resist the pull of the past.

Your Money,Are Markets Efficient? Even the Supreme Court Is Weighing In,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/your-money/are-markets-efficient-even-the-supreme-court-is-weighing-in.html,"A fierce debate about an academic theory loomed over the Nobel in economic science for 2013. Last week, the Supreme Court enshrined that argument in jurisprudence, issuing a ruling that is likely to make it harder for investors to prevail in some big class-action lawsuits. The court's decision emerges from a debate that has been simmering among economists for decades. It flared up again last fall, after the Nobel committee announced that it was giving the 2013 prize to three economists with discordant views on a wonky notion known as the efficient-markets hypothesis. Its core tenet is that market prices embody all available information. That may seem a simple thought, but its implications are controversial, and the court's position has important repercussions. The court delved into this arcane issue during a busy week in which it issued a series of major decisions dealing with cellphone privacy, presidential recess appointments and broadcasters' copyrights in a dispute involving Aereo, the upstart television streaming service. It turned to the efficient-markets hypothesis in a case concerning asbestos liabilities of the oil services company Halliburton. The court rejected a broad challenge to class-action lawsuits contending securities fraud. But it added a major new hurdle for investors that could stop some class-action suits in their tracks by letting corporate defendants try to prove, at an early stage, that there was no connection at all between corporate misstatements and share prices -- and therefore no grounds for litigation.

The court justified this change by updating its notion of market efficiency, basing its interpretation partly on the views of Robert J. Shiller, the Yale economist and a 2013 Nobel laureate. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. echoed Mr. Shiller when he said market prices usually reflect what's known about publicly traded companies -- but not always. In other words, the court said that while market prices contain a great deal of information, they are highly imperfect. The court used that distinction to make an important change in the class-action arena. From now on, companies facing class actions can try to show at an early stage that even if they've made misstatements, market prices were not affected. Until now, the courts had held that the efficient-markets hypothesis meant that such public statements automatically affected market prices, John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia law professor, said in an interview. ""The court ruling could make it easier for companies to get cases dismissed at an early stage,"" he said. ""And it is likely to make it much more expensive for plaintiffs -- for investors -- to file suit."" The argument about efficient markets re-emerged in October, when Mr. Shiller, along with Eugene Fama and Lars Peter Hansen, both of the University of Chicago, won the Nobel. The Nobel committee initially finessed the economists' disagreements by citing their collective contributions to ""empirical analysis of asset prices."" But the divergent opinions among the economists are deep-seated, and Mr. Shiller addressed them last October in an Economic View column in The New York Times; Justice Roberts cited the column in his decision. Mr. Shiller wrote: ""Professor Fama is known as the father of the modern efficient-markets theory, which says financial prices efficiently incorporate all available information and are in that sense perfect. In contrast, I have argued that the theory makes little sense, except in fairly trivial ways.""

Mr. Shiller emphasized ""the enormous role of human error"" that has been documented by behavioral finance and the need to rein in market excesses through regulation. (In an interview, Mr. Fama expressed skepticism about Mr. Shiller's emphasis on the irrational, and said that while he preferred market solutions, regulatory action was often needed.) In court filings and oral arguments, Halliburton said debates like this demonstrated that economists no longer accept the efficient-markets hypothesis as gospel. Therefore, the company argued, the court should overturn a 1988 decision, Basic v. Levinson, that has allowed shareholders in publicly traded companies to form class-action groups based on the automatic assumption that significant misstatements caused share prices to fall. ""The economics have changed,"" Aaron M. Streett, Halliburton's lawyer, declared before the court. He said that many investors ""do not rely on the integrity of the market price whatsoever."" In the Supreme Court's decision, which sends the Halliburton case back to a lower court, Justice Roberts rejected these claims, quoting Mr. Shiller's column. It said: ""Of course, prices reflect available information."" Yet the court also accepted that market prices reflect information imperfectly at best, as Mr. Shiller and others have argued. Sometimes, for example, prices are much higher than can be justified by fundamental factors like corporate earnings and other public information. Sometimes, the court suggested, investors may have disregarded major misstatements by companies' executives. So the court occupied something of a middle ground, much as the Nobel committee did. Investors may continue to rely on the efficient-markets hypothesis in forming class-action groups, and may assume that share prices reflect corporate misstatements. But corporate defendants may now try to prove in specific cases that there was no connection between their statements and price movements. ""It's death by 1,000 cuts,"" Professor Coffee said. ""This isn't in itself a devastating blow to class-action plaintiffs. But it hurts, and it follows a number of other decisions that have limited plaintiffs' ability to sue successfully.""

It could have been much worse for plaintiffs, he observed. A concurring but critical opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas and endorsed by Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Antonin Scalia, came down firmly on Halliburton's side. They said the economic profession's critique of the efficient-markets hypothesis has been so devastating that the precedent set by the Basic v. Levinson case should be overturned entirely. But the court as a whole approached efficient markets much as many long-term investors do. For many practical purposes, it's reasonable to assume that markets are efficient. That's why it's so hard to outperform them, and why so many people use low-cost index funds as their core portfolio holdings. Yet, in another sense, markets aren't efficient at all. They are prone to bouts of irrational exuberance, outright panic and other apparent aberrations that give wise traders an edge, and make claims of total efficiency hard to defend. Are markets efficient? It's all in the details, the court seemed to say. Often they are, but sometimes they're not, and investors need to prepare for the consequences.","In a case that delved into a much-debated academic theory, a ruling erects a new hurdle for investors to clear in some class-action lawsuits.",2811c86a-31be-5200-b3c9-3d40f8421369,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/29/business/29-STRA/29-STRA-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=431&w=600&s=1237f36c9a32bbf5b94027634104fc59dff225ce4ab778cbe21201d340e179ef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"The court's order was brief, provisional and unsigned, but it drew a furious dissent from the three female justices.",2811c86a-31be-5200-b3c9-3d40f8421369,Demo_data/D1_img2/12811c86a-31be-5200-b3c9-3d40f8421369.jpg,21,"Are Markets Efficient?

In court filings and oral arguments, Halliburton said debates like this demonstrated that economists no longer accept the efficient-markets hypothesis as gospel. Therefore, the company argued, the court should overturn a 1988 decision, Basic v. Levinson, that has allowed shareholders in publicly traded companies to form class-action groups based on the automatic assumption that significant misstatements caused share prices to fall. ""The economics have changed,"" Aaron M. Streett, Halliburton's lawyer, declared before the court. He said that many investors ""do not rely on the integrity of the market price whatsoever."" In the Supreme Court's decision, which sends the Halliburton case back to a lower court, Justice Roberts rejected these claims, quoting Mr. Shiller's column. It said: ""Of course, prices reflect available information."" Yet the court also accepted that market prices reflect information imperfectly at best, as Mr. Shiller and others have argued. Sometimes, for example, prices are much higher than can be justified by fundamental factors like corporate earnings and other public information. Sometimes, the court suggested, investors may have disregarded major misstatements by companies' executives. So the court occupied something of a middle ground, much as the Nobel committee did. Investors may continue to rely on the efficient-markets hypothesis in forming class-action groups, and may assume that share prices reflect corporate misstatements. But corporate defendants may now try to prove in specific cases that there was no connection between their statements and price movements. ""It's death by 1,000 cuts,"" Professor Coffee said. ""This isn't in itself a devastating blow to class-action plaintiffs. But it hurts, and it follows a number of other decisions that have limited plaintiffs' ability to sue successfully.""

It could have been much worse for plaintiffs, he observed. A concurring but critical opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas and endorsed by Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Antonin Scalia, came down firmly on Halliburton's side. They said the economic profession's critique of the efficient-markets hypothesis has been so devastating that the precedent set by the Basic v. Levinson case should be overturned entirely. But the court as a whole approached efficient markets much as many long-term investors do. For many practical purposes, it's reasonable to assume that markets are efficient. That's why it's so hard to outperform them, and why so many people use low-cost index funds as their core portfolio holdings. Yet, in another sense, markets aren't efficient at all. They are prone to bouts of irrational exuberance, outright panic and other apparent aberrations that give wise traders an edge, and make claims of total efficiency hard to defend. Are markets efficient? It's all in the details, the court seemed to say. Often they are, but sometimes they're not, and investors need to prepare for the consequences. In a case that delved into a much-debated academic theory, a ruling erects a new hurdle for investors to clear in some class-action lawsuits.",,"Are Markets Efficient? Even the Supreme Court Is Weighing In A fierce debate about an academic theory loomed over the Nobel in economic science for 2013. Last week, the Supreme Court enshrined that argument in jurisprudence, issuing a ruling that is likely to make it harder for investors to prevail in some big class-action lawsuits. The court's decision emerges from a debate that has been simmering among economists for decades. It flared up again last fall, after the Nobel committee announced that it was giving the 2013 prize to three economists with discordant views on a wonky notion known as the efficient-markets hypothesis. Its core tenet is that market prices embody all available information. That may seem a simple thought, but its implications are controversial, and the court's position has important repercussions. The court delved into this arcane issue during a busy week in which it issued a series of major decisions dealing with cellphone privacy, presidential recess appointments and broadcasters' copyrights in a dispute involving Aereo, the upstart television streaming service. It turned to the efficient-markets hypothesis in a case concerning asbestos liabilities of the oil services company Halliburton. The court rejected a broad challenge to class-action lawsuits contending securities fraud. But it added a major new hurdle for investors that could stop some class-action suits in their tracks by letting corporate defendants try to prove, at an early stage, that there was no connection at all between corporate misstatements and share prices -- and therefore no grounds for litigation.

The court justified this change by updating its notion of market efficiency, basing its interpretation partly on the views of Robert J. Shiller, the Yale economist and a 2013 Nobel laureate. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. echoed Mr. Shiller when he said market prices usually reflect what's known about publicly traded companies -- but not always. In other words, the court said that while market prices contain a great deal of information, they are highly imperfect. The court used that distinction to make an important change in the class-action arena. From now on, companies facing class actions can try to show at an early stage that even if they've made misstatements, market prices were not affected. Until now, the courts had held that the efficient-markets hypothesis meant that such public statements automatically affected market prices, John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia law professor, said in an interview. ""The court ruling could make it easier for companies to get cases dismissed at an early stage,"" he said. ""And it is likely to make it much more expensive for plaintiffs -- for investors -- to file suit."" The argument about efficient markets re-emerged in October, when Mr. Shiller, along with Eugene Fama and Lars Peter Hansen, both of the University of Chicago, won the Nobel. The Nobel committee initially finessed the economists' disagreements by citing their collective contributions to ""empirical analysis of asset prices."" But the divergent opinions among the economists are deep-seated, and Mr. Shiller addressed them last October in an Economic View column in The New York Times; Justice Roberts cited the column in his decision. Mr. Shiller wrote: ""Professor Fama is known as the father of the modern efficient-markets theory, which says financial prices efficiently incorporate all available information and are in that sense perfect. In contrast, I have argued that the theory makes little sense, except in fairly trivial ways.""

Mr. Shiller emphasized ""the enormous role of human error"" that has been documented by behavioral finance and the need to rein in market excesses through regulation. (In an interview, Mr. Fama expressed skepticism about Mr. Shiller's emphasis on the irrational, and said that while he preferred market solutions, regulatory action was often needed.)

Art & Design,Amos Rex Museum Is Helsinki's New Homegrown Star,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/arts/design/amos-rex-museum-is-helsinkis-new-homegrown-star.html,"HELSINKI, Finland -- The novelist Meg Wolitzer once wrote that Helsinki is ""a place no one ever thinks about unless they're listening to Sibelius, or lying on the hot, wet slats of a sauna, or eating a bowl of reindeer."" The city leadership here is keen to add something new to that list: fine art. Amos Rex, a new contemporary art museum, goes a long way toward achieving that goal. A museum that appears to physically resist its placement in a vast underground space, it is topped by five conical domes that bubble up from the surface of the Lasipalatsi Square in downtown Helsinki like inverted craters of an alien moonscape. Children clamber up the mounds, teenagers skateboard down its slopes, and passers-by snap selfies.

The $58 million privately funded museum arrives less than two years after Helsinki's City Council rejected a plan to build a $138 million Guggenheim museum along the city's harbor. City officials as well as residents were deeply, often rancorously, divided about the proposal, with supporters asserting that the Guggenheim would raise the city's international profile and serve as an economic game-changer, while opponents said local resources were better spent on cultural institutions that showcased Finnish talent. Finland, after all, has a proud tradition of design exemplified by the architect Alvar Aalto, the designers Timo Sarpaneva and Tapio Wirkkala and, yes, Marimekko. After the five-year controversy dissipated, Mayor Jan Vapaavuori of Helsinki said, everyone took a step back to reconsider the city's cultural priorities.

""What the Guggenheim process led to was a quite serious reflection among all important art players in the city, where they were forced to assess their own place and role in today's world,"" Mayor Vapaavuori said in an interview. ""The positive side of the discussion is that we have a more comprehensive understanding of what culture and art does for the city. It could be that without the Guggenheim discussion we would not be that far along.""

In many ways, Amos Rex vindicates the city's decision to turn down the Guggenheim project, and instead champion a homegrown Finnish institution. The new contemporary art museum is funded by private money, whereas the Guggenheim was designed as a public-private partnership, which some artists feared would sap funding for local arts initiatives. Mr. Kartio, who said he would have welcomed the Guggenheim, notes that planning for Amos Rex was already underway when the Guggenheim project fell apart. However, he added, ""The timing was fortunate for us because of course politically, internally in Finland, we were compared to Guggenheim all the time. Since this was completely privately financed and homegrown, people were very fond of us, especially the people who weren't in favor of the Guggenheim."" The money to build the new museum came from a foundation established by the museum's Finnish founder, Amos Anderson, a newspaper publisher and a patron of the arts, who died in 1961 and earmarked his fortune for the building of the Amos Anderson Art Museum. Four years after he died, the museum opened in his own home in Helsinki with a collection of mostly Finnish and other European art.

Seeking to build a new larger home, Amos Anderson museum and its officials chose the Lasipalatsi, or glass palace, a landmark of Finnish functionalist architecture that houses an entertainment and shopping center with an Art Deco cinema called Bio Rex. Designed by architecture students in 1936 as a temporary site for the Olympics (scheduled to take place in Helsinki in 1940 but postponed until 1952 because of World War II), the Lasipalatsi was supposed to be torn down afterward, but remained, and became a cherished national landmark. The private Amos Rex Foundation formed a real estate company with the city of Helsinki to jointly own the old entertainment complex, and to build a new museum, which it owns independently. The foundation leases the land on which both buildings sit from the city. To build the museum while preserving the existing building, the architects came up with an ingenious idea to excavate the central plaza and create 24,000 square feet of exhibition space. Below the exhibition halls, two stories down, are archive and storage rooms. Amos Rex, which derives its name from the museum's founder and the cinema, has helped create a kind of ""museum mile"" that joins up with the three of the city's nearby art institutions -- Kiasma Contemporary Art Museum, the Helsinki Art Museum and Kunsthalle Helsinki. ""It's one big cluster, and we bind it together in a way, and we all support each other,"" Mr. Kartio said.

The results of Helsinki's post-Guggenheim rethink are manifest throughout the city: A few blocks away from the new museum, the Helsinki Central Library Oodi is under construction and expected to open in December. The Helsinki Art Museum is organizing an International Helsinki Art Biennial to open in 2020 and two weeks ago, the city announced its intention to build a world-class architecture and design museum in the harborside space that the Guggenheim might have occupied. ""A lot of exciting things are happening right now in Helsinki,"" said Raija Koli, director of Frame Contemporary Art of Finland, which provides grants to Finnish artists and coordinates Finland's participation in the Venice Biennale.

More than two dozen actors and actresses -- including Andrew Rannells, Carolee Carmello, Jason Gotay, Telly Leung, Norm Lewis and Andrea Burns -- assembled Wednesday afternoon on the tall red staircase that rises above a theater ticket booth. After a few breaths, they launched into the song ""Sunday"" from Stephen Sondheim's musical ""Sunday in the Park With George.""

The unadvertised event, directed by the Pulitzer- and Tony-Award-winning composer Tom Kitt and the Tony honoree Michael McElroy, was set up by a volunteer organization, NYCNext, which has sought to counter the effects of the coronavirus pandemic by producing what it calls public ""moments of joy."" James Sampliner and the Tony and Emmy winner Billy Porter provided the song arrangement, along with McElroy. Standing among the ensemble on the staircase was Bernadette Peters, who played Dot, one of the main characters in ""Sunday in the Park,"" which debuted on Broadway in 1984.

Peters said before the performance that she hoped the song ""Sunday,"" which in the musical helps to create calm during a fractious moment, could do the same in real life. ""We can't move around, we can't gather, we can't go to the theater,"" she said. ""We need something that can be a healing balm.""

The performance comes at a precarious time for the theater. Broadway and Off Broadway houses have been closed since March, and although a few shows have announced opening dates in March 2021 -- a major one, ""The Music Man,"" is aiming for May -- the future is uncertain.

NYCNext was started in August by Andy Lerner, who has led tech start-ups, and Maryam Banikarim and Caroline Donahue, both of whom have worked as marketing executives. It aims to support the city's cultural community by showcasing performers at a time when venues are closed and providing the participants with stipends. The effort was born of impatience with the notion that New York City would not be able to recover from the pandemic, said Banikarim, adding: ""We believe the best way to revitalize our city is through the arts."" Its first event took place in Chelsea on Sept. 25 when the Grammy-nominated pianist and composer Elio Villafranca and his band performed on the sidewalk of West 21st Street near Ninth Avenue. On Tuesday a poet named Mahogany Browne recited works in Central Park. Future events are expected to include performances by jazz musicians, comedians and dancers. To avoid drawing a crowd that might make social distancing difficult, NYCNext does not publicly promote these events. The fact that performances are not announced adds a serendipitous element of discovery to the moment, Lerner said, adding: ""You just stumble into something amazing that only happens in New York."" Two dozen shielded performers, including Bernadette Peters and Andrew Rannells, surprised passers-by with a rendition of Stephen Sondheim's ""Sunday.""",10,['10'],10

Dane DeHaan has watery, nearly translucent blue eyes -- somewhere between mysterious and radioactive, ""made for cinema,"" according to the director Derek Cianfrance -- and a haunted stare that has made him Hollywood's go-to avatar of teenage torment. In the few years he has been acting on film, he has played a high-school loner turned telekinetic terrorist (""Chronicle""), the troubled son of an absent father (in Mr. Cianfrance's ""The Place Beyond the Pines""), and a tortured analysand (""In Treatment""). So when a reporter asked Mr. DeHaan what they might spend an afternoon doing together, the answer came as a surprise. ""I always say if I could do anything, I would be a professional golfer,"" said Mr. DeHaan, whose handicap is a country-club respectable 12, on a windy December morning at the driving range at Chelsea Piers in New York. ""But I'm not good enough, so I'm an actor."" He reared back and drove into a golf ball with a satisfying thwack, and it sailed out toward the Hudson River. Finding one of American film's favorite young interpreters of subcutaneous roil on the links (or the range, barring that) was not what I expected, I told Mr. DeHaan. ""No one expects me to golf,"" he said. ""I don't think there are so many moody, brooding people on golf courses. But I always say that golfing and acting are very similar to me. I think they're both singular practices. It's something that no matter how hard I work at, or practice, I will never be as good as I want to be."" (There's that roil.)

Actually, Mr. DeHaan contests the descriptions, now standard, of him as a tortured-artist type (though he did recently play James Dean in ""Life,"" a Dean biopic). He has played happy-go-lucky (in John Hillcoat's 2012 bootlegging period piece ""Lawless"") and straight man to a marauding zombie girlfriend (""Life After Beth""). But it is Mr. DeHaan's brittle soulfulness that has booked him four Prada ad campaigns and kept him on lists of soon-to-break-out stars. That break has been primed by independent films like ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" and the studio-system imprimatur of a key role as the Green Goblin in ""The Amazing Spiderman 2."" In 2017, he is headlining, for the first time in his career, two major films. ""A Cure for Wellness,"" a creepy thriller from Gore Verbinski, the director of ""The Ring"" and the first three ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films, comes out next month, with Mr. DeHaan in nearly every frame. And Luc Besson's ""Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets,"" a reportedly $180 million sci-fi spectacular -- the most expensive film ever made in Europe, according to Variety -- follows in July, with hopes of expanding into a franchise. In that one, Mr. DeHaan is not the surly teenager or the supporting villain: He is, for the first time, the hero, Valerian himself -- with a supermodel consort, no less: Cara Delevingne.

""I feel like Hollywood can really take people, take a hold of them and make them feel pressure that doesn't need to be there,"" he said. ""I don't want Hollywood to influence me, I want to influence Hollywood."" He now shuttles there a week or two a year for meetings. (He also admits he takes himself too seriously ""almost all the time."") ""I think a lot of people put that pressure on themselves,"" he said, gazing out over the driving range. ""I think people feel like this is their moment and they have to capitalize on it, or whatever. I want to do this forever. So I'm more than happy to just kind of let things happen."" It helps that he has not been without an acting job since graduating from the University of North Carolina School of the Arts in 2008. He had been so eager to act that he finished high school there as well, as part of its high school program. ""I never waited tables out of school,"" he said. ""I waited tables summers between college in anticipation of waiting tables."" His return to the restaurant never arrived. He followed a well-worn path -- the ""Law & Order"" guest appearance, Off Broadway theater, recurring roles on HBO -- before crossing over onto the big screen. Luckily, he added, even if doing ""The Aliens,"" a three-man play by the Pulitzer winner Annie Baker, which he performed in a 104-seat theater and for which he won an Obie Award, was ""one of the best experiences of my career."" ""Still,"" he added, ""when I was doing Off Broadway plays, I would have been making more money collecting unemployment."" Mr. DeHaan looks younger than his 30 years, and his delicate, almost alien handsomeness makes him an unusual fit for a Hollywood megastar. He had to adopt a ""bro lifestyle"" to bulk up for ""Valerian."" But he has always found support among directors, including Steven Spielberg, who cast him in a small part in ""Lincoln,"" and Mr. Cianfrance.

At the time of his casting in that film, Mr. DeHaan was not well known; Mr. Cianfrance had not seen any of his other films. ""There was discussion of other more established actors for that role, and actors that would have secured financing in an easier way in that time,"" he said. ""But across the board, he was undeniable."" Mr. DeHaan has an intensity that holds the screen, whether he is uncovering the sinister truth about a Swiss spa in ""A Cure for Wellness"" (""We want to do what 'Jaws' did to a day at the beach to the health spa,"" Mr. Verbinski said) or battling aliens as a time-traveling special agent in ""Valerian."" ""With Dane, 30 seconds after I sat down at the bar with him, the restaurant, I knew that it was him, for sure,"" said Mr. Besson, the director of ""Valerian."" ""After one minute, my problem is, if he says no, I'm in trouble. It was already printed in my head."" ""Valerian"" is a different kind of film, and a different kind of acting, for Mr. DeHaan, who is classically trained and speaks reverently of ""doing"" rather than ""acting."" (On the inside of his forearm, ""i do."" is tattooed in tiny letters, as a reminder.) ""Valerian"" was shot largely in front of a blue screen, for the visual effects to be added in later.

Media,"Young Sheldon, Meet SpongeBob: CBS and Viacom Are Back Together",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/business/media/viacom-cbs-merger.html,"After more than a decade apart, CBS and Viacom are reuniting. In a deal that closed on Wednesday, the CBS Corporation, the company behind the broadcast network CBS and the publisher Simon & Schuster, merged with Viacom, the owner of Paramount Pictures and the cable outlets MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. The combination brings together a set of businesses that once dominated the media and entertainment industries but are now fighting to stay relevant in an increasingly digital world. CBS and Viacom were already corporate siblings before the deal, both controlled by National Amusements, a theater company that grew into a major conglomerate under the mogul Sumner M. Redstone, who is ailing at age 96. His daughter, Shari Redstone, emerged as the company's leader in recent years and had sought a merger since 2016. With the deal, Ms. Redstone cements her role as a trailblazing figure in a male-dominated industry, a woman whose peers now include leaders of media behemoths like Brian Roberts of Comcast and Robert A. Iger of the Walt Disney Company. Now that Disney has joined Netflix and Amazon as a force in the streaming industry, the merger is meant to make ViacomCBS, as the new company will be called, a bigger player in digital entertainment than the two companies had been as separate entities. Unlike its streaming rivals -- a group that includes Apple, with its new Apple TV Plus streaming service, and AT&T, the owner of HBO Max, scheduled to make its debut in May -- ViacomCBS will focus on supplying films and television series to other companies. With an executive team led by Ms. Redstone, the chairwoman of the company's board, ViacomCBS intends to follow a strategy of selling its wares to the highest bidder as demand for original content increases.

The number of streaming subscribers around the world surpassed the number of cable subscribers for the first time last year, and Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and other platforms are fighting to attract customers who have cut the cord or are one cable technician visit away from doing so. That has set off a frenzy of activity among the streaming companies, and ViacomCBS has already started to take advantage of the new demand. Paramount's TV arm, for example, created ""Jack Ryan,"" a popular series on Amazon Prime Video, and CBS has produced content, like the true-crime drama ""Unbelievable"" and the comedic thriller ""Dead to Me,"" that streams exclusively on Netflix. In October, Viacom sold streaming rights to the animated comedy series ""South Park"" to AT&T's HBO Max in a deal worth $500 million.

ViacomCBS also has a small toehold in streaming services with CBS All Access and Showtime, which together have more than eight million subscribers and feature originals such as the reboot of ""Twilight Zone"" and ""Star Trek: Picard,"" which is scheduled to have a January debut. Viacom's free, ad-supported streaming service, Pluto, has more than 20 million viewers a month. From 2000, when National Amusements acquired CBS, until 2006, the two companies were a single entity. Mr. Redstone split them apart when the Viacom properties were growing faster than the CBS broadcast network and radio stations. A reunification was seen as necessary now that television audiences have eroded and the movie business is adjusting to streaming. The creation of ViacomCBS is a victory for Ms. Redstone, whose efforts to bring about a merger drew opposition from the CBS Corporation board, including its former chief executive Leslie Moonves. Mr. Moonves was pushed out last year after several women accused him of sexual misconduct, charges he has denied. Some analysts have questioned the deal, saying it may not be enough to fend off the decline in traditional television. Michael Nathanson, an analyst with the Wall Street research firm MoffettNathanson, said ViacomCBS would have to ""explain how the combination helps better insulate it"" from the current pressures on the cable and satellite business.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The merger seems to be largely a ""defense play,"" he said. ""For the stock to work, they have to prove that their current strategy is either building long-term asset value or generating more attractive"" returns, he said. ""If they can't, we remain in purgatory."" Shares of both CBS and Viacom have dropped about 20 percent since the merger was announced in August.

David Nevins, the head of Showtime, has been put in charge of overseeing collaborative efforts between programmers across both CBS and Viacom, reporting to both Mr. Bakish and Mr. Ianniello. Mr. Nevins is directly in charge of programming for CBS, Showtime and BET. He has also developed a close working relationship with Ms. Redstone. This is the first season in decades that CBS programming has come from someone other than Mr. Moonves, who was often credited with the network's ratings dominance over the past decade. For this season so far, CBS has lost the crown to NBC, with ratings falling more than 12 percent from last year. The 2019-20 television season could ultimately shake out differently. On a conference call with analysts last month, Mr. Ianniello predicted that CBS would finish the season in May ""as America's most-watched network."" The deal is the last in the current wave of media megamergers. Two major transactions totaling more than $150 billion closed just last year. AT&T buttoned up its $80 billion acquisition of Time Warner. Shortly thereafter, the Walt Disney Company beat out its rival Comcast to win the majority of Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox business for $71.3 billion. But the combination of CBS and Viacom amounts to a fraction of those deals, underscoring the need for such a merger. The equity value of the new business is about $25 billion, putting it far behind rivals like Disney, which also has a theme parks business, and NBCUniversal, which is owned by the cable giant Comcast. Several key advisers to Ms. Redstone have suggested a bigger deal could come in the future, with ViacomCBS selling to a tech giant, four people familiar with those discussions have said. Even so, Ms. Redstone is not in a rush to sell off a business she has just spent years pulling together, they added. When asked if ViacomCBS was large enough to compete against its supersize competitors, Ms. Redstone said it would be a mistake to confuse a company's value with its heft.","Shari Redstone gets her wish, bringing about the merger of two media giants in a $25 billion deal.

With an executive team led by Ms. Redstone, the chairwoman of the company's board, ViacomCBS intends to follow a strategy of selling its wares to the highest bidder as demand for original content increases.

The number of streaming subscribers around the world surpassed the number of cable subscribers for the first time last year, and Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and other platforms are fighting to attract customers who have cut the cord or are one cable technician visit away from doing so. That has set off a frenzy of activity among the streaming companies, and ViacomCBS has already started to take advantage of the new demand. Paramount's TV arm, for example, created ""Jack Ryan,"" a popular series on Amazon Prime Video, and CBS has produced content, like the true-crime drama ""Unbelievable"" and the comedic thriller ""Dead to Me,"" that streams exclusively on Netflix. In October, Viacom sold streaming rights to the animated comedy series ""South Park"" to AT&T's HBO Max in a deal worth $500 million.

ViacomCBS also has a small toehold in streaming services with CBS All Access and Showtime, which together have more than eight million subscribers and feature originals such as the reboot of ""Twilight Zone"" and ""Star Trek: Picard,"" which is scheduled to have a January debut. Viacom's free, ad-supported streaming service, Pluto, has more than 20 million viewers a month. From 2000, when National Amusements acquired CBS, until 2006, the two companies were a single entity. Mr. Redstone split them apart when the Viacom properties were growing faster than the CBS broadcast network and radio stations. A reunification was seen as necessary now that television audiences have eroded and the movie business is adjusting to streaming. The creation of ViacomCBS is a victory for Ms. Redstone, whose efforts to bring about a merger drew opposition from the CBS Corporation board, including its former chief executive Leslie Moonves. Mr. Moonves was pushed out last year after several women accused him of sexual misconduct, charges he has denied. Some analysts have questioned the deal, saying it may not be enough to fend off the decline in traditional television. Michael Nathanson, an analyst with the Wall Street research firm MoffettNathanson, said ViacomCBS would have to ""explain how the combination helps better insulate it"" from the current pressures on the cable and satellite business.

This is the first season in decades that CBS programming has come from someone other than Mr. Moonves, who was often credited with the network's ratings dominance over the past decade. For this season so far, CBS has lost the crown to NBC, with ratings falling more than 12 percent from last year. The 2019-20 television season could ultimately shake out differently.

Even so, Ms. Redstone is not in a rush to sell off a business she has just spent years pulling together, they added. When asked if ViacomCBS was large enough to compete against its supersize competitors, Ms. Redstone said it would be a mistake to confuse a company's value with its heft.

The plan is to become a content arms dealer in the streaming wars.",,"Young Sheldon, Meet SpongeBob: CBS and Viacom Are Back Together After more than a decade apart, CBS and Viacom are reuniting. In a deal that closed on Wednesday, the CBS Corporation, the company behind the broadcast network CBS and the publisher Simon & Schuster, merged with Viacom, the owner of Paramount Pictures and the cable outlets MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central. The combination brings together a set of businesses that once dominated the media and entertainment industries but are now fighting to stay relevant in an increasingly digital world. CBS and Viacom were already corporate siblings before the deal, both controlled by National Amusements, a theater company that grew into a major conglomerate under the mogul Sumner M. Redstone, who is ailing at age 96. His daughter, Shari Redstone, emerged as the company's leader in recent years and had sought a merger since 2016. With the deal, Ms. Redstone cements her role as a trailblazing figure in a male-dominated industry, a woman whose peers now include leaders of media behemoths like Brian Roberts of Comcast and Robert A.

Sports,"Relocated From a Park to a Football Stadium, the Miami Open Emphasizes Luxury",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/sports/tennis/miami-open-hard-rock-stadium.html,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- Stephen M. Ross swears he is not embroiled in a third-set tiebreaker with Larry Ellison, the billionaire co-founder of Oracle who bought the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif., a decade ago and transformed it into a tony desert party for tennis players and fans. Still, when the moved and improved Miami Open begins this week at Hard Rock Stadium, home of Ross's Miami Dolphins, it will not be hard to imagine Ross, a billionaire real estate developer, keeping a tiny scorecard in his back pocket. ""Larry's done a great job,"" Ross said. ""He set the bar high, and it's all great for tennis. But for us, it's more natural not to compete, or at least to do so in our own way."" Ross, who bought the Dolphins in 2008 and spent $550 million renovating the stadium, stepped in when IMG, which owns the Miami Open, found itself at an impasse with a Key Biscayne resident who controlled the land where the tournament had been played since 1987.

That man, Bruce Matheson, refused to allow $50 million worth of renovations to the Crandon Park site, and his prolonged lawsuits convinced the tournament that it was time to go. Rather than see the tournament -- and its hundreds of millions in local revenue -- uprooted from South Florida to Orlando or China, Ross decided to partner with IMG and move the tournament about 20 miles northwest to his football stadium. He spent an additional $72 million to transform it into a state-of-the-art tennis venue. The move wasn't well received by everyone. ""Key Biscayne had a very intimate setting, and you can't beat the drive over the Rickenbacker Causeway, with blue water on both sides of you,"" said John Isner, the defending Miami Open champion. ""We had a lot of history in that place, and that stadium court will always be very special to me."" At the new site, a temporary main court was erected on the football field, with half of the seats were blocked off by screens. A 5,191-seat grandstand court, two other show courts and eight additional match courts -- all permanent -- were built on top of parking lots. On a recent tour, those lots were indiscernible behind purple flowers, artificial grass, 35-foot mature palm trees costing $35,000 a pop, and a giant fountain that guards one of the many entrances to the stadium. There is also a 40-by-90-foot video screen, the largest in tennis, just outside the stadium in a spot modeled after Wimbledon's Henman Hill, minus the grass.

The change recalls the United States Open's move from the charming but outgrown West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills in 1978 to the more functional, if less romantic, U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in nearby Flushing Meadows. It took a while to get used to the new digs, but no one would ever want to go back to the old ones.

""This place has a much larger footprint, so we can do more things,"" said Tom Garfinkel, the Dolphins' chief executive. ""We are giving people an unprecedented luxury experience in tennis, just like the N.F.L."" Tournament organizers did not take the word ""luxury"" lightly. The stadium court -- painted in colors called Oasis Blue and Biscayne Blue -- seats 13,800, the same as the main court in Key Biscayne. But this court features 4,738 premium seats, many that resemble Barcaloungers, with individual television screens. These seats range in price from $50,000 to $70,000 for the two-week tournament. Some are right on the court. Premium-seat packages, most of which were sold out two months before the start of the tournament, include private dining rooms. Some suites have seats made out of Ferrari leather. For a privileged 1,000 visitors, there is a dedicated entrance from a private parking lot, in which spectators pass through a tent lined with art, including works by Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol that can be purchased for upward of $1 million. Ticket prices at every level have increased by up to 40 percent over last year, though several thousand grounds passes are available for as little as $15 each day. Sales by the end of last month were up 25 percent, thanks, in part, to Dolphins season-ticket holders who have been cajoled into watching tennis. ""There's a bit of a challenge in giving people the confidence that this really is for the best,"" said James Blake, the tournament director.

Ross helped choose everything on the site: the flowers, the gigantic paintings that line the stadium corridors, the tiles on the bathroom walls. ""I had a picture in my head of what I wanted this to look like, the same way I do my real estate deals,"" said Ross, who is also behind Manhattan's Hudson Yards project. ""It's all in the details. Little things matter. People notice, and they're watching for those details."" The number of practice courts, many with spectator seating, have doubled from those at Key Biscayne, to 18. But unlike in Key Biscayne, those courts will not be turned over for the public to play on after the tournament ends.

 The players, at least, should be happy. Their amenities have been enhanced, with dining areas and gym spaces tripling in size. The top eight seeds in the men's and women's singles draws, as well as all former champions, will be given private suites to be used by their entourages. But organizers see the event as more than a tennis tournament. The grounds will open at least two hours before play begins each day to encourage people to come early to eat, shop and listen to concerts by local musicians. ""What we wanted was a venue that would allow us the freedom and flexibility to grow and innovate the event,"" said Mark Shapiro, president of Endeavor, IMG's parent company. ""Key Biscayne was lovely, but we simply outgrew it. What we've got now is going to be supernatural, like walking through a Lollapalooza, and a tennis tournament grew out of it. Forget becoming the fifth major, we're the new U.S. Open.""","The moved and improved Miami Open, a top men's and women's tennis tournament, begins this week at Hard Rock Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins.",79b6234a-2638-5d95-974b-0ab5321833df,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/18/sports/18miamiopenweb1/18miamiopenweb1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=3473d9f35599d9c324442a510aa1b169d0b3c129b20c580e72e3b5b51f8b1ad1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Miami Open, which begins this week, has moved from a Key Biscayne park to Hard Rock Stadium, home of the Dolphins.",79b6234a-2638-5d95-974b-0ab5321833df,Demo_data/D1_img2/179b6234a-2638-5d95-974b-0ab5321833df.jpg,9,"Relocated From a Park to a Football Stadium, the Miami Open Emphasizes Luxury MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- Stephen M.

Health,College Rape Prevention Program Proves a Rare Success,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/health/college-rape-prevention-program-proves-a-rare-success.html,"A program that trained first-year female college students to avoid rape substantially lowered their risk of being sexually assaulted, a rare success against a problem that has been resistant to many prevention efforts, researchers reported Wednesday. Sexual violence is a serious hazard on college campuses. By some estimates, one in five female students are raped, and women tend to be at the greatest risk during their first year on campus. In the aftermath of several highly publicized campus rapes, the White House last spring issued guidelines directing colleges to address sexual assault. In a randomized trial, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, first-year students at three Canadian campuses attended sessions on assessing risk, learning self-defense and defining personal sexual boundaries. The students were surveyed a year after they completed the intervention. The risk of rape for 451 women randomly assigned to the program was about 5 percent, compared with nearly 10 percent among 442 women in a control group who were given brochures and a brief information session.

""Only 22 women would need to take the program in order to prevent one additional rape from occurring within one year,"" the authors concluded. The risk of attempted rape was even lower -- 3.4 percent among women who received the training, compared with 9.3 percent among those who did not. ""It's an important, rigorous study that shows that resistance and self-defense training needs to be part of college sexual assault prevention,"" said Sarah E. Ullman, a professor of criminology, law and justice at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who was not involved in the research. ""This won't solve the problem, but it's an important piece that has been overlooked."" Other researchers praised the trial as one of the largest and most promising efforts in a field pocked by equivocal or dismal results. But some took issue with the philosophy underlying the program's focus: training women who could potentially be victims, rather than dealing with the behavior and attitudes of men who could potentially be perpetrators. Such a strategy could reduce risk for some victims, said Sarah DeGue, a behavioral scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who reviewed evaluations of prevention programs for the White House Task Force on campus sexual assault.

But, she added, ""It's possible that potential perpetrators could encounter individuals who have received training and just move on to more vulnerable individuals."" To address sexual assault comprehensively, she and other experts said, colleges as well as high schools and middle schools should take multifaceted approaches that considered root causes of violence against women and men, compelled bystanders to intervene and gave guidance on healthy relationships. Charlene Y. Senn, the lead author of the Canadian study and a social psychologist at the University of Windsor, did not disagree. ""It gives women the knowledge and skills they need right now, but the long-term solution is to reduce their need to defend themselves,"" said Dr. Senn, who also supervises a campus bystander program. The two-year trial at universities in Calgary, Alberta, and Windsor and Guelph in Ontario, expanded on components of other resistance programs and added a training session on sexuality and relationships. Students, largely recruited in psychology classes, could take all four three-hour sessions over a weekend or in weekly classes. The structure was purposely dynamic, and included role-playing, discussion and problem-solving. One major hurdle, Dr. Senn said, was that the young women had been taught just to be on guard against the stranger rapist -- to fear the shadowy campus at night, the deserted parking lots. Rape by an acquaintance or a romantic partner, far more common, is not a concept they had considered, she said. At a session Lindsey Boyes attended at the University of Calgary, she said she was startled to learn that if someone had sex with a person who was intoxicated, the act could be defined as sexual assault: A person who is mentally incapacitated because of alcohol or drugs cannot legally give consent.

""I felt an adrenaline rush and some shock,"" Ms. Boyes, 22, said. ""It was eye-opening to realize that I had been raped in high school."" At 16, she had been at a party, drinking alcohol for the first time, and was very drunk. A boy offered to take her home -- and then assaulted her. She was devastated, for years thinking of herself as ""damaged goods."" But the resistance program brought some relief, she said. ""I no longer felt shame and guilt about it being my fault,"" Ms. Boyes said. During the program, students learn strategies to protect themselves at social gatherings, such as buddy systems. Ms. Boyes said that now when she went to bars, she covered her glass to protect against date-rape drugs. The Canadian program was also effective for women who, like Ms. Boyes, had been victimized before they went to college. A study about sexual assaults of first-year college women, published this month in The Journal of Adolescent Health, noted that women who had been previously assaulted may be up to six times more likely to be revictimized during that first year than women who had never faced sexual violence. The acquaintance rape theme was continued in the self-defense session. Women may be better prepared psychologically to be physically aggressive against a stranger, Dr. Senn said, ""but if the attacker is your friend's boyfriend, you're not going to push your keys against his eyes.""","The program focused on first-year students at three Canadian campuses who attended sessions on assessing risk, learning self-defense and defining personal sexual boundaries.",d421cae9-618c-52f3-b651-843cd91bb10f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/11/science/11ASSAULT/11ASSAULT-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=725b21ac0e1520ec866c8ed44fe37da3ddfc4c6a47873839225eff2c1361aa5e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Lindsey Boyes, a student at the University of Calgary, attended a college sexual assault prevention program that helped her feel less shame about being assaulted in high school.",d421cae9-618c-52f3-b651-843cd91bb10f,Demo_data/D1_img2/1d421cae9-618c-52f3-b651-843cd91bb10f.jpg,1,"College Rape Prevention Program Proves a Rare Success A program that trained first-year female college students to avoid rape substantially lowered their risk of being sexually assaulted, a rare success against a problem that has been resistant to many prevention efforts, researchers reported Wednesday.

Real Estate,"House Hunting in Nicaragua: A Solar-Powered Ranch for $650,000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/realestate/house-hunting-in-nicaragua-a-solar-powered-ranch-for-650000.html,"This eco-friendly equestrian estate is set on about nine acres outside the popular coastal town of San Juan del Sur, in southwestern Nicaragua. Built in 2009 using salvaged roof tiles and doors, locally sourced wood and other antique or handcrafted materials, the colonial-style property includes nine total bedrooms, stables for up to 18 horses and a swimming pool, and is powered entirely by solar energy (with grid backup). The estate, named Rancho Chilamate for a chilamate tree growing on the grounds, is anchored by a 3,800-square-foot, four-bedroom main house. An adjacent house has a garage and two staff bedrooms, and a stand-alone casita has one bedroom. Two additional staff bedrooms are near the stables.

""Particularly now,"" he said, ""I can certainly think of worse places to be self-isolating,"" adding that the price was recently reduced from $729,000. Heather van Doorninck, the seller, said she wanted to honor Nicaragua's architectural heritage when she built the estate. ""All the cement is by hand,"" she said. ""Every single rock here is cut in the forest with a chain saw. Nothing is milled here. It's authentically grounded and gorgeous."" Ms. van Doorninck has rented rooms for $200 a night and led guests on horseback tours to the beach or through a riverside jungle inhabited by howler monkeys. ""The cacophony of jungle noises here is amazing,"" she said. A long driveway leads to a parking area and a white security wall surrounding much of the property. Through the gate are a stone courtyard with a barbecue and an outdoor dining area. Two faded blue antique doors open into the home's great room, with 20-foot vaulted ceilings and tropical hardwood beams. The space includes a dining table for 10, a TV area and the kitchen.

Past the kitchen, saloon doors lead to a hallway with a half bathroom, a pantry storage area and a tack room. To the right are three bedrooms with en suite bathrooms, including the master suite, all of which open out to the pool terrace through French doors. A fourth bedroom and a bathroom with an outdoor shower are across a courtyard off the great room. The 10-by-20-foot pool and surrounding flagstone deck have a variety of areas for sitting and dining, including a built-in nook with a Moroccan-style daybed, hammocks and a covered outdoor living room. Each of the home's two towers disguises a water tower. A separate 700-square foot, one-bedroom, one-bath casita with a kitchen and terrace is about 200 feet away, nestled under shade trees.

Besides the stables, the facilities include a round training pen, a barn, paddocks and a forge. The property is being sold turnkey -- with option to be operated as a bed-and-breakfast -- and the horses can be purchased separately. The estate, located just outside the village of Escamequita, is 10 miles south of San Juan del Sur, a former fishing village that reinvented itself as a hub for surfing and tourism in the late 20th century. The Pacific Ocean is about 45 minutes away by horse and 10 minutes by car. Augusto Cesar Sandino International Airport, in Managua, Nicaragua's capital, is about 100 miles north, and Daniel Oduber Quiros International Airport in Costa Rica is 90 miles south. Nicaragua remains one of Latin America's poorest countries, though its economy saw encouraging gains in the years after the global recession as the country became more popular with tourists and second-home buyers, especially as an alternative to pricier Costa Rica.

In 2017, the nation's real estate market was poised to ""boom,"" Mr. Cooper said: ""At that time, it was one of the fastest growing tourism destinations out there, in terms of the numbers of arrivals."" That changed in the spring of 2018, when Nicaragua's government clashed with protesters, prompting the U.S. State Department to issue a travel advisory ""due to civil unrest, crime, limited health care availability, and arbitrary enforcement of laws."" The turmoil took its toll on the housing market. Along the country's southwest coast, which includes San Juan del Sur and the Emerald Coast, sales prices dropped an average of 30 percent, and in some cases as much as 50 percent, said Julio Cesar Lacayo, a founder of Aurora Beachfront Realty, based in San Juan del Sur. Since 2018, Mr. Lacayo said, his company has shifted more to rentals as sales in Managua have remained scarce -- a situation exacerbated by the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.

Jesse ""Pedro"" Resau, the owner and broker of RE/MAX Coastal Properties, a Nicaraguan agency, said the market in San Juan del Sur had begun to pick up in mid-2019 and into 2020. In March and April, the pandemic all but stamped out his business. Two-bedroom houses selling for around $300,000 before the turmoil of 2018 are now selling for 25 percent less. At a higher price tier, homes that sold for $500,000 to $700,000 in early 2018 are now going for $300,000 to $400,000. At the luxury end, homes that had been listed for between $900,000 and $1.2 million in early 2018 were selling for between $500,000 to $700,000 in mid-2019, but the luxury market is currently stagnant, Mr. Resau said. ""There has been no movement in luxury homes here, not in the San Juan del Sur area, since last year,"" he said. But his business has begun picking up again. A few properties that offered video tours and price cuts are in contract, and that prospective buyers have made offers from abroad on homes they toured during earlier visits. Agents said there are discounts to be found, though many sellers haven't lowered asking prices on homes, even as land prices have fallen. ""They're basically trying to see how this pandemic is going to shake out before they make a determination of what they're going to do with their properties here,"" Mr. Resau said. Despite the ""double blow of the period of the crisis followed by this outbreak,"" Mr. Cooper said, ""interest was looking very rosy again at the beginning of this year. And people even now are doing virtual viewings.""","In the popular surf town of San Juan del Sur, the global pandemic is smothering market gains forged after Nicaragua's political turmoil of 2018.",575f1184-ee28-5909-9915-d340523ac707,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/13/realestate/13IHH-Nicaragua-slide-NZUV/13IHH-Nicaragua-slide-NZUV-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=df908a24854dbd72fa62b5f7ff81876ddb22599d654e60c7e94d0138ec7cfe3a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Built in 2009 using salvaged roof tiles and doors, locally sourced wood and other antique or handcrafted materials, the colonial-style property includes nine total bedrooms.",575f1184-ee28-5909-9915-d340523ac707,Demo_data/D1_img2/1575f1184-ee28-5909-9915-d340523ac707.jpg,7,"House Hunting in Nicaragua: A Solar-Powered Ranch for $650,000 This eco-friendly equestrian estate is set on about nine acres outside the popular coastal town of San Juan del Sur, in southwestern Nicaragua.

""Particularly now,"" he said, ""I can certainly think of worse places to be self-isolating,"" adding that the price was recently reduced from $729,000. Heather van Doorninck, the seller, said she wanted to honor Nicaragua's architectural heritage when she built the estate. ""All the cement is by hand,"" she said. ""Every single rock here is cut in the forest with a chain saw. Nothing is milled here. It's authentically grounded and gorgeous."" Ms. van Doorninck has rented rooms for $200 a night and led guests on horseback tours to the beach or through a riverside jungle inhabited by howler monkeys. ""The cacophony of jungle noises here is amazing,"" she said. A long driveway leads to a parking area and a white security wall surrounding much of the property. Through the gate are a stone courtyard with a barbecue and an outdoor dining area. Two faded blue antique doors open into the home's great room, with 20-foot vaulted ceilings and tropical hardwood beams. The space includes a dining table for 10, a TV area and the kitchen.

Past the kitchen, saloon doors lead to a hallway with a half bathroom, a pantry storage area and a tack room. To the right are three bedrooms with en suite bathrooms, including the master suite, all of which open out to the pool terrace through French doors. A fourth bedroom and a bathroom with an outdoor shower are across a courtyard off the great room. The 10-by-20-foot pool and surrounding flagstone deck have a variety of areas for sitting and dining, including a built-in nook with a Moroccan-style daybed, hammocks and a covered outdoor living room. Each of the home's two towers disguises a water tower. A separate 700-square foot, one-bedroom, one-bath casita with a kitchen and terrace is about 200 feet away, nestled under shade trees.

Besides the stables, the facilities include a round training pen, a barn, paddocks and a forge. The property is being sold turnkey -- with option to be operated as a bed-and-breakfast -- and the horses can be purchased separately. The estate, located just outside the village of Escamequita, is 10 miles south of San Juan del Sur, a former fishing village that reinvented itself as a hub for surfing and tourism in the late 20th century. The Pacific Ocean is about 45 minutes away by horse and 10 minutes by car. Augusto Cesar Sandino International Airport, in Managua, Nicaragua's capital, is about 100 miles north, and Daniel Oduber Quiros International Airport in Costa Rica is 90 miles south. Nicaragua remains one of Latin America's poorest countries, though its economy saw encouraging gains in the years after the global recession as the country became more popular with tourists and second-home buyers, especially as an alternative to pricier Costa Rica.

In 2017, the nation's real estate market was poised to ""boom,"" Mr. Cooper said: ""At that time, it was one of the fastest growing tourism destinations out there, in terms of the numbers of arrivals."" That changed in the spring of 2018, when Nicaragua's government clashed with protesters, prompting the U.S. State Department to issue a travel advisory ""due to civil unrest, crime, limited health care availability, and arbitrary enforcement of laws."" The turmoil took its toll on the housing market. Along the country's southwest coast, which includes San Juan del Sur and the Emerald Coast, sales prices dropped an average of 30 percent, and in some cases as much as 50 percent, said Julio Cesar Lacayo, a founder of Aurora Beachfront Realty, based in San Juan del Sur. Since 2018, Mr. Lacayo said, his company has shifted more to rentals as sales in Managua have remained scarce -- a situation exacerbated by the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.

Jesse ""Pedro"" Resau, the owner and broker of RE/MAX Coastal Properties, a Nicaraguan agency, said the market in San Juan del Sur had begun to pick up in mid-2019 and into 2020. In March and April, the pandemic all but stamped out his business. Two-bedroom houses selling for around $300,000 before the turmoil of 2018 are now selling for 25 percent less. At a higher price tier, homes that sold for $500,000 to $700,000 in early 2018 are now going for $300,000 to $400,000. At the luxury end, homes that had been listed for between $900,000 and $1.2 million in early 2018 were selling for between $500,000 to $700,000 in mid-2019, but the luxury market is currently stagnant, Mr. Resau said. ""There has been no movement in luxury homes here, not in the San Juan del Sur area, since last year,"" he said. But his business has begun picking up again. A few properties that offered video tours and price cuts are in contract, and that prospective buyers have made offers from abroad on homes they toured during earlier visits. Agents said there are discounts to be found, though many sellers haven't lowered asking prices on homes, even as land prices have fallen. ""They're basically trying to see how this pandemic is going to shake out before they make a determination of what they're going to do with their properties here,"" Mr. Resau said. Despite the ""double blow of the period of the crisis followed by this outbreak,"" Mr. Cooper said, ""interest was looking very rosy again at the beginning of this year.

Opinion,"Yes, Even George Washington",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/28/opinion/george-washington-confederate-statues.html,"On the issue of American slavery, I am an absolutist: enslavers were amoral monsters. The very idea that one group of people believed that they had the right to own another human being is abhorrent and depraved. The fact that their control was enforced by violence was barbaric. People often try to explain this away by saying that the people who enslaved Africans in this country were simply men and women of their age, abiding by the mores of the time. But, that explanation falters. There were also men and women of the time who found slavery morally reprehensible. The enslavers ignored all this and used anti-black dehumanization to justify the holding of slaves and the profiting from slave labor.

People say that some slave owners were kinder than others. That explanation too is problematic. The withholding of another person's freedom is itself violent. And the enslaved people who were shipped to America via the Middle Passage had already endured unspeakably horrific treatment.

One of the few written accounts of the atrocious conditions on these ships comes from a man named the Rev. Robert Walsh. The British government outlawed the international slave trade in 1807, followed by the United States in 1808. The two nations patrolled the seas to prevent people from continuing to kidnap Africans and bringing them to those countries illegally. In 1829, one of the patrols spotted such a ship, and what Walsh saw when he boarded the ship is beyond belief. The ship had been at sea for 17 days. There were over 500 kidnapped Africans onboard. Fifty-five had already been thrown overboard. The Africans were crowded below the main deck. Each deck was only 3 feet 3 inches high. They were packed so tight that they were sitting up between one another's legs, everyone completely nude. As Walsh recounted, ""there was no possibility of their lying down or at all changing their position by night or day."" Each had been branded, ""burnt with the red-hot iron,"" on their breast or arm. Many were children, little girls and little boys.

Not only could light not reach down into the bowels of those ships, neither could fresh air. As Walsh recounted, ""The heat of these horrid places was so great and the odor so offensive that it was quite impossible to enter them, even had there been room."" These people, these human beings, sat in their own vomit, urine and feces, and that of others. If another person sat between your legs, their bowels emptied out on you. These voyages regularly lasted over a month, meaning many women onboard experienced menstruation in these conditions. Many of the enslaved, sick or driven mad, were thrown overboard. Others simply jumped. In fact, there was so much human flesh going over the side of those ships that sharks learned to trail them. This voyage was so horrific that I can only surmise that the men, women and children who survived it were superhuman, the toughest and the most resilient our species has to offer. But of the people who showed up to greet these reeking vessels of human torture, to bid on its cargo, or to in any way benefit from the trade and industry that provided the demand for such a supply, I have absolute contempt. Some people who are opposed to taking down monuments ask, ""If we start, where will we stop?"" It might begin with Confederate generals, but all slave owners could easily become targets. Even George Washington himself.

To that I say, ""abso-fricking-lutely!"" George Washington enslaved more than 100 human beings, and he signed the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, authorizing slavers to stalk runaways even in free states and criminalizing the helping of escaped slaves. When one of the African people he himself had enslaved escaped, a woman named Ona Maria Judge, he pursued her relentlessly, sometimes illegally. Washington would free his slaves in his will, when he no longer had use for them. Let me be clear: Those black people enslaved by George Washington and others, including other founders, were just as much human as I am today. They love, laugh, cry and hurt just like I do. When I hear people excuse their enslavement and torture as an artifact of the times, I'm forced to consider that if slavery were the prevailing normalcy of this time, my own enslavement would also be a shrug of the shoulders. I say that we need to reconsider public monuments in public spaces. No person's honorifics can erase the horror he or she has inflicted on others. Slave owners should not be honored with monuments in public spaces. We have museums for that, which also provide better context. This is not an erasure of history, but rather a better appreciation of the horrible truth of it. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Education,Panel Rejects Proposal to Stop School Closings,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/education/panel-rejects-proposal-to-stop-new-york-city-school-closings.html,"A city panel on Monday night rejected a proposal to stop city-mandated school closings in a tense, often raucous meeting, effectively putting any hopes of reversing Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's education policy into the next mayor's hands. The proposal would have withdrawn current plans to close, co-locate or phase out struggling public schools and also would have placed a moratorium on such future plans until the system, a centerpiece of the mayor's education strategy, could be re-evaluated. The plan was sponsored by four members of the Panel for Educational Policy, a school oversight board, who are not administration appointees. But the rest of the panel, chosen by Mr. Bloomberg, voted the proposal down, prompting accusations that the majority members were puppets of the administration.

""In 10 years, no one's raised a hand against the mayor, because you know you'll get fired if you do,"" said Patrick Sullivan, a panel representative from Manhattan. He was joined in supporting the proposal by the representatives of the Bronx and Queens. Brooklyn's representative abstained. In response to Mr. Sullivan, Judy Bergtraum, a mayoral appointee, retorted: ""We're here because we believe in what's being done."" Several candidates running to replace the mayor have spoken out against the closings, which they say disproportionately affect minority students, wreak havoc on students' academic careers and do not give underperforming schools enough chances to improve. One of those mayoral hopefuls, William C. Thompson Jr., a former city comptroller who previously served as president of the Board of Education, nodded to the importance of the issue among the Democratic candidates. ""I'm amazed I'm the only mayoral candidate here this evening,"" he said during the meeting. ""We're waiting for the next mayor -- I hope it'll be me -- who'll again believe in our children, believe in our communities,"" he said at a news conference before the meeting.

Soon after, Dennis M. Walcott, the schools chancellor, noted that Mr. Thompson himself closed schools during his time on the Board of Education. Also on the agenda for the meeting, which was held at Brooklyn Technical High School, were dozens of proposals to close or phase out schools, or place multiple schools in one building, a practice known as co-locating. Twenty-two schools were up for eventual closing, including the Jonathan Levin High School for Media and Communications, named in honor of a popular teacher who was brutally murdered in 1997. Founded with high hopes, the school has struggled recently, and the panel was expected to approve its closing by the end of Monday's meeting. The city decides which schools to rehabilitate, wind down or close based on letter grades that it assigns based on student test scores and other measures. ""It should be used as a last resort, not a first option,"" Dmytro Fedkowskyj, the Queens representative who introduced the resolution, said of the closings strategy. ""More needs to be done sooner, when the problems are recognized, not three years later."" When Marc Sternberg, a deputy education chancellor, tried to respond, his words were drowned out by chants from the crowd of hundreds of students, teachers and parents, prompting one panel member to repeatedly ask the crowd to be more respectful. ""It goes without saying that these are not easy decisions, and there is no joy for me or my colleagues in having to bring these proposals to you this evening,"" Mr. Sternberg said, adding, ""We have a responsibility to act."" There may have been a vociferous crowd, but many said the meeting was less well-attended than in the past, with the room only half full. Even Michael Mulgrew, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, did not attend, sending a deputy instead.","The vote at a tense and often raucous meeting meant  current plans to close, co-locate or phase out struggling public schools would move forward.",1c6fd5d8-c066-5f69-ac3c-592f439f7997,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/03/12/nyregion/PANEL/PANEL-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=295&w=600&s=c01dfb4c79b4b7142d3d2981d0621387da089a39e0fc0d2ac7188b42a9d78bb8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Spectators at Monday night's meeting at Brooklyn Technical High School.,1c6fd5d8-c066-5f69-ac3c-592f439f7997,Demo_data/D1_img2/11c6fd5d8-c066-5f69-ac3c-592f439f7997.jpg,22,"Panel Rejects Proposal to Stop School Closings A city panel on Monday night rejected a proposal to stop city-mandated school closings in a tense, often raucous meeting, effectively putting any hopes of reversing Mayor Michael R.

One of those mayoral hopefuls, William C. Thompson Jr., a former city comptroller who previously served as president of the Board of Education, nodded to the importance of the issue among the Democratic candidates. ""I'm amazed I'm the only mayoral candidate here this evening,"" he said during the meeting. ""We're waiting for the next mayor -- I hope it'll be me -- who'll again believe in our children, believe in our communities,"" he said at a news conference before the meeting.

Soon after, Dennis M. Walcott, the schools chancellor, noted that Mr. Thompson himself closed schools during his time on the Board of Education. Also on the agenda for the meeting, which was held at Brooklyn Technical High School, were dozens of proposals to close or phase out schools, or place multiple schools in one building, a practice known as co-locating. Twenty-two schools were up for eventual closing, including the Jonathan Levin High School for Media and Communications, named in honor of a popular teacher who was brutally murdered in 1997. Founded with high hopes, the school has struggled recently, and the panel was expected to approve its closing by the end of Monday's meeting. The city decides which schools to rehabilitate, wind down or close based on letter grades that it assigns based on student test scores and other measures. ""It should be used as a last resort, not a first option,"" Dmytro Fedkowskyj, the Queens representative who introduced the resolution, said of the closings strategy. ""More needs to be done sooner, when the problems are recognized, not three years later."" When Marc Sternberg, a deputy education chancellor, tried to respond, his words were drowned out by chants from the crowd of hundreds of students, teachers and parents, prompting one panel member to repeatedly ask the crowd to be more respectful. ""It goes without saying that these are not easy decisions, and there is no joy for me or my colleagues in having to bring these proposals to you this evening,"" Mr. Sternberg said, adding, ""We have a responsibility to act."" There may have been a vociferous crowd, but many said the meeting was less well-attended than in the past, with the room only half full. Even Michael Mulgrew, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, did not attend, sending a deputy instead. The vote at a tense and often raucous meeting meant  current plans to close, co-locate or phase out struggling public schools would move forward.",,"Panel Rejects Proposal to Stop School Closings A city panel on Monday night rejected a proposal to stop city-mandated school closings in a tense, often raucous meeting, effectively putting any hopes of reversing Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's education policy into the next mayor's hands. The proposal would have withdrawn current plans to close, co-locate or phase out struggling public schools and also would have placed a moratorium on such future plans until the system, a centerpiece of the mayor's education strategy, could be re-evaluated. The plan was sponsored by four members of the Panel for Educational Policy, a school oversight board, who are not administration appointees. But the rest of the panel, chosen by Mr. Bloomberg, voted the proposal down, prompting accusations that the majority members were puppets of the administration.

""In 10 years, no one's raised a hand against the mayor, because you know you'll get fired if you do,"" said Patrick Sullivan, a panel representative from Manhattan. He was joined in supporting the proposal by the representatives of the Bronx and Queens. Brooklyn's representative abstained.

Food,Maryland Rye Whiskey Has Finally Returned. But What Was It in the First Place?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/14/dining/drinks/rye-whiskey-maryland.html,"Maryland Rye Whiskey Has Finally Returned. But What Was It in the First Place?

BALTIMORE -- H.L. Mencken, the Jazz Age scribe who loved Baltimore and booze in equal measure, spared no opportunity to praise his state's famous rye whiskey. It was, he said, ""the most healthful appetizer yet discovered by man."" The Mencken family doctor, he added, apparently approved: ""He believed and taught that a shot of Maryland whiskey was the best preventive of pneumonia in the R months."" Maryland was once a whiskey distilling powerhouse, surpassed among the states only by Kentucky and Pennsylvania. It produced 5.6 million gallons in 1911, its pre-Prohibition high point -- most of it rye, supposedly made in a distinctive style that was readily recognized from the Midwest to Manhattan. But the distilleries, and the style, disappeared after World War II and the consolidation of the whiskey industry in Kentucky.

""I want to get it back to what it once was,"" said Brian Treacy, the president of the Sagamore Spirit Distillery, which opened in 2017 along a postindustrial stretch of Baltimore dockland. ""It was a regional style then, and it can be a regional style again."" There's just one problem: For all its fame and praise, no one quite knows what ""Maryland style"" meant. Most distillers back before Prohibition did not keep recipes, or document how they made their whiskey . Newspaper accounts differ widely; even Mencken left few clues about his beloved drink. It is one of the great mysteries of the industrial age in America: How could a product so widely appreciated disappear so completely? ""It's a fascinating question, and it's generating a fascinating debate,"" said Teresa DeFlitch, who studies the history of American distilling at Wigle Whiskey, in Pittsburgh.

That debate is about more than just stylistic accuracy. As distillers dig through America's whiskey legacy for inspiration, what does it mean to recreate a ""historic"" style? And do they risk imposing contemporary ideas and categories on a past that might have seen things quite differently? There's no doubt that something called Maryland rye existed at some point. The state was once flush with distilleries -- in 1911 there were 44, half of them in central Baltimore -- and advertisements from the late 19th century promote the drink as a more refined alternative to its rougher cousins from Kentucky and Pennsylvania. One ad, for a brand called Maryland Club, appeared in a leather-bound datebook recovered from the Titanic. Some of that promotion was just marketing. But many distillers and historians today agree that Maryland rye did have a different flavor profile -- sweeter than the rye made farther west, with less spice and a supple, perhaps buttery palate. That, however, is where the agreement ends and the guesswork begins. What, for starters, gave Maryland rye that special sweetness? According to Jaime Windon, a founder of Lyon Distilling, on Maryland's Eastern Shore, and the president of the Maryland Distillers Guild, the state's whiskey makers mixed their rye grain with a high percentage of corn, which lends sweetness to balance the rye's spiciness.

But Ned Wight, who owns New England Distilling and whose great-great-great-grandfather ran one of the largest distilleries in Maryland, says his family's whiskey had no use for corn. (Though based in Portland, Me., his company makes its own Maryland-style rye, called Gunpowder.) ""Generally, old Maryland ryes were made with rye and malted barley,"" Mr. Wight said. The sweetness might have come from using a brewer's yeast to ferment the grain, which produces lighter, more floral notes than a traditional distiller's yeast, he said. Todd Leopold, who also makes a Maryland-style rye at his Leopold Brothers distillery in Denver, splits the difference: Like Sagamore, he uses corn as well as rye in his whiskey, but like Mr. Wight he uses a brewer's yeast, as well as a second fermentation with naturally occurring airborne yeast, to amplify the sweetness. He also employs a custom-made, three-chamber pot still, a piece of equipment rarely seen today but said to be popular in the 19th century because it gave whiskey a rounder, more flavorful character. ""By using these techniques, you can make it so the spicy note in the rye is hardly there at all,"" Mr. Leopold said.

Then again, maybe the sweetness came from somewhere else entirely. Before the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906, it was legal to add fruit juice, caramel and all manner of chemicals to a whiskey. Drinker, beware. Mike Veach, a whiskey historian in Kentucky, said many of the Maryland distilleries before 1906 were actually rectifiers -- plants that bought unaged whiskey from elsewhere, then redistilled it, or aged it, or added something to it to make a final product they could legally call whiskey.

That doesn't mean that Maryland rye was necessarily dangerous or low quality, said John Lipman, another whiskey historian who has done extensive research on Maryland rye; it just wasn't the unadulterated whiskey we expect today. ""Real Maryland rye was a manufactured beverage, like Benedictine,"" he said. While distillery record-keeping improved only marginally in the early 20th century , it seems likely that after the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act, and certainly after Prohibition, Maryland rye lost much of its unusual character. Some skeptics even question whether Maryland rye had anything to distinguish it, apart from where it was made -- and apart from some clever marketing. Sam Komlenic, a whiskey historian in Pennsylvania, believes that Maryland rye whiskey varied too much over time, and that the state's distilleries traded too much product with Pennsylvania distilleries, to allow a clear difference in styles. ""I would like to hope that Maryland rye was as distinctive as people want it to be, but I worry it wasn't,"" he said. Does that mean that Sagamore and its fellow Maryland rye distillers are wrong? Or that everyone is partly right? Because the more you dive into the question of what Maryland rye was, the more you realize that you're asking the wrong question. Modern ideas about what constitutes a style are hemmed in by a long list of laws, standards and customs, and policed by constant chatter in the media and online. We obsess over how something is made, and imagine that people in the past did, too. But what if they didn't?

""Strictly speaking, 'Maryland style' didn't mean as much back then as it does now,"" said Max Lents, a founder of the Baltimore Spirits Company, which makes a Maryland-style rye. The fuzziness around the definition of Maryland rye may be exactly the point. Before social media, before Prohibition, before the Pure Food and Drug Act and the modernization of distilling, inconsistency was a given. Maybe it was even prized. Rye grain was prevalent in the Mid-Atlantic, so distillers used that. But if there was corn growing nearby, they used that, too. Before laboratory-grown yeast emerged in the 20th century, they developed their yeast cultures from whatever happened to be floating in the air nearby. Those might make the whiskey taste dramatically different from an identical batch made a few miles away. And even where there was consistency in a flavor profile, that likely changed over the years, as new rules and changing consumer tastes forced the industry to shift. ""At different points in time there were different understandings of what Maryland rye was, and even then it depended on who you talked to,"" said Ms. DeFlitch, of Wigle Whiskey. In other words, one reason to celebrate Maryland rye is that no one can quite agree on what the term meant: It demonstrates the diversity within whiskey regions, as in local food styles more broadly, before the mid-20th century. ""Trying to overdefine something doesn't actually carry on that tradition,"" Ms. DeFlitch said. Instead, distillers should embrace the uncertainty. ""The more inspiration we have today, the better.""","Distillers say they've revived a long-lost favorite, but they face a conundrum: Nobody really knows how the old stuff was made.",5a9b49bd-0a8b-558b-935e-939c4d418a3f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/20/dining/20rye1/20rye1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=7fcdff0f1c4ab8df719e5a77a7e083cc37a7b839d35f6ddd290f88844297bf28&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sagamore Spirit, in Baltimore, is one of several distilleries trying to resurrect Maryland-style rye whiskey.

Media,'We Shall Overcome' Is Put in Public Domain in a Copyright Settlement,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/business/media/we-shall-overcome-copyright.html,"The two sides in a legal dispute over whether the song ""We Shall Overcome"" was subject to copyright protection reached a settlement on Friday that put the civil rights anthem in the public domain, lawyers involved in the case said. Two plaintiffs, the makers of a documentary on the song's history and producers of the 2013 film ""Lee Daniels' The Butler,"" who wanted to use part of the song in the movie, challenged its copyright protection in federal court. The documentarians had been denied permission and the moviemakers were asked to pay as much as $100,000 to use it in several critical scenes, according to the law firm representing the plaintiffs. In September, a federal judge partly rejected the copyright claim, saying the song's adaptation from an older work -- including changing ""will"" to ""shall"" -- was not original enough to qualify for protection.

That decision, by Judge Denise L. Cote of United States District Court in Manhattan, focused on the first verse, which has the lyrics ""We shall overcome/We shall overcome some day"" and ""Oh deep in my heart I do believe/We shall overcome some day."" Judge Cote granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs, saying that the song ""lacks originality,"" and focused in her ruling on the changing of ""will"" to ""shall."" The song's origins have been traced to spirituals at the turn of the 20th century. In 1960 and 1963, the publisher Ludlow Music registered copyrights for it, saying that the song's authors -- including Pete Seeger -- had made changes to earlier versions of it.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The plaintiffs sought to have the copyright for the entire song declared invalid, with the case set for trial next month. The litigation, which began in 2016, had become expensive and Ludlow spent far more on the case than it had earned on the song in recent years, Paul V. LiCalsi, a lawyer for Ludlow and the other defendant, the Richmond Organization, said in a telephone interview on Friday night.

In a statement, Ludlow said royalties from the song since the early 1960s had been donated to the nonprofit Highlander Research and Education Center in Tennessee, which created the We Shall Overcome Fund to distribute all of the royalties through grants and scholarships in black communities. It was not immediately clear how much money the fund had distributed. ""Without the same scope of copyright protection, Highlander's grants and scholarships will be deeply affected in the future,"" the statement said. Ludlow also said uses of the song had in the past been ""carefully vetted"" but warned that its words and melody could now be used by advertising agencies and others ""in any manner they wish, including inaccurate historical uses, commercials, parodies, spoofs and jokes, and even for political purposes by those who oppose civil rights for all Americans.""

Science,First All-Female Spacewalk Canceled Because NASA Doesn't Have Two Suits That Fit,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/science/female-spacewalk-canceled.html,"First All-Female Spacewalk Canceled Because NASA Doesn't Have Two Suits That Fit

It hadn't been planned as a historic mission, yet it would have represented a moment of sorts: the first all-female spacewalk. But that moment will have to wait, NASA said Monday, because of a somewhat basic issue -- spacesuit sizes. The two astronauts who were scheduled to walk together in space on Friday, Anne C. McClain and Christina H. Koch, would both need to wear a medium-size torso component. But only one is readily available at the International Space Station.

[Read about the Trump administration's pledge to return to the moon within 5 years.] The mission itself is unchanged. On Friday, two astronauts will venture outside of the space station on a six-hour mission to install massive lithium-ion batteries that will help to power the research laboratory. Ms. Koch is still scheduled to participate, along with her fellow astronaut Nick Hague; Ms. McClain did her first spacewalk last week.

But the first women-only venture outside of the confines of the space station will have to happen on another day. ""After consulting with McClain and Hague following the first spacewalk, mission managers decided to adjust the assignments, due in part to spacesuit availability on the station,"" NASA said in a statement. Stephanie Schierholz, a spokeswoman for NASA, said in an interview on Monday that there were already two medium-size hard upper torsos -- ""essentially the shirt of the spacesuit,"" according to NASA -- at the space station. But there were a couple of issues. One was that Ms. McClain had thought she would be able to work in a large-size torso, but after her spacewalk last Friday, she wore a medium-size torso and learned that it fit her better. Ms. Koch also uses the same size. And of the two medium-size torsos available, one has yet to be properly configured for a spacewalk. It would take hours of crew labor -- not to mention some additional risk -- to fix that in time for Friday. Instead of doing that, NASA decided to simply switch out the astronauts.

In the end, both women will have done a spacewalk -- just not together. ""When you have the option of just switching the people, the mission becomes more important than a cool milestone,"" Ms. Schierholz said. [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] On Friday, Ms. Koch and Mr. Hague will be supported by a team on the ground that includes a number of women in key positions, including the spacewalk's flight director, Mary Lawrence, and its lead officer, Jackie Kagey. In a briefing at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston this month, Ms. Lawrence, Ms. Kagey and Kenneth Todd, the station's operations integration manager, said officials had not immediately recognized the significance of the original lineup for Friday's ""extravehicular activity,"" or EVA. It was only as they discussed the schedule during a meeting that they realized it was the first time they had scheduled an all-female spacewalk.

""We're sort of getting to the point of inevitability,"" Ms. Schierholz said of an all-female EVA. Ms. McClain and Ms. Koch were part of the 2013 astronaut class, and of the eight people in that class -- chosen from more than 6,000 applicants -- half were women, a first for NASA. The agency lists 38 active astronauts on its website, and 12 are women. The current roster of six astronauts at the space station -- three Americans, one Canadian and two Russians -- allows the team to carry out a number of important projects, with an eye toward making sure each crew member accumulates significant experience, Mr. Todd said. NASA officials hope the relatively young American astronauts will continue to travel to space in the coming years and assist new recruits in the future. The batteries being installed on this mission store solar power that the station needs when it is not in direct sunlight. Work on the battery systems will continue for the next few years as international teams bring more lithium-ion batteries to the station, which is more than 200 miles from Earth. The missions require meticulous planning, and robots do as much of the work as possible before astronauts take the risk of venturing into space. In the busy days ahead of a spacewalk, the crew help to prepare and fit their colleagues' spacesuits, which function as mini-spacecraft once they step outside. Ms. Koch shared photos on Twitter of her colleagues as they suited up for last Friday's spacewalk.","The astronauts, Anne McClain and Christina Koch, will both walk in space — just not together, because only one medium-size torso component is available.",c54fba49-c676-5c4d-9fc2-3d9adb49deb5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/25/science/25xp-NASA/25xp-NASA-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=cb0aea28e4d9b4c1c064724d76d7eb40ada12bffa968d8ebc3e1750d9cf837de&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Christina Koch is scheduled to do her first spacewalk on Friday, but not with another female astronaut as had previously been planned.",c54fba49-c676-5c4d-9fc2-3d9adb49deb5,Demo_data/D1_img2/1c54fba49-c676-5c4d-9fc2-3d9adb49deb5.jpg,2,"First All-Female Spacewalk Canceled Because NASA Doesn't Have Two Suits That Fit First All-Female Spacewalk Canceled Because NASA Doesn't Have Two Suits That Fit

Media,"Trump's Blocking of Twitter Users Is Unconstitutional, Judge Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/business/media/trump-twitter-block.html,"Apart from the man himself, perhaps nothing has defined President Trump's political persona more than Twitter. But on Wednesday, one of Mr. Trump's Twitter habits -- his practice of blocking critics on the service, preventing them from engaging with his account -- was declared unconstitutional by a federal judge in Manhattan. Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald, addressing a novel issue about how the Constitution applies to social media platforms and public officials, found that the president's Twitter feed is a public forum. As a result, she ruled that when Mr. Trump or an aide blocked seven plaintiffs from viewing and replying to his posts, he violated the First Amendment. If the principle undergirding Wednesday's ruling in Federal District Court stands, it is likely to have implications far beyond Mr. Trump's feed and its 52 million followers, said Jameel Jaffer, the Knight First Amendment Institute's executive director and the counsel for the plaintiffs. Public officials throughout the country, from local politicians to governors and members of Congress, regularly use social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to interact with the public about government business.

[Read more: Twitter users talk about getting blocked by the president.] ""This ruling should put them on notice, and if they censor critics from social media accounts used for official purposes, they run the risk that someone will sue them and win,"" he said of public officials. Asked whether the administration would unblock the users or appeal the ruling, Kerri Kupec, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department's civil division, demurred from making any specific pronouncement. ""We respectfully disagree with the court's decision and are considering our next steps,"" she said. In her ruling, Judge Buchwald said Mr. Trump and Dan Scavino, the White House social media director, ""exert governmental control over certain aspects of the @realDonaldTrump account."" But she did not issue an injunction ordering Mr. Trump or Mr. Scavino to unblock the users, a nod to the separation-of-powers sensitivities of a judge's ordering a president to do something. Rather, her ruling simply declared what the Constitution requires, with the expectation that the White House would comply. ""Because no government official is above the law and because all government officials are presumed to follow the law once the judiciary has said what the law is, we must assume that the president and Scavino will remedy the blocking we have held to be unconstitutional,"" she wrote in her ruling.

The plaintiffs had argued that Mr. Trump's Twitter feed is an official government account and that blocking users from following it is a violation of their First Amendment rights. In June, the plaintiffs had sent a letter to the White House asking to be unblocked. When that went ignored, they sued.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Their complaint argued that Mr. Trump's feed amounted to a ""digital town hall"" where not only did the president and his aides communicate information but members of the public -- by replying to Mr. Trump's tweets and others who responded to him -- exchanged views with one another. By blocking particular people from viewing or replying to message chains because they had expressed views he did not like, it argued, Mr. Trump had violated their First Amendment rights. Judge Buchwald, who was appointed to the federal bench in 1999 by President Bill Clinton, agreed. ""The viewpoint-based exclusion of the individual plaintiffs from that designated public forum is proscribed by the First Amendment and cannot be justified by the president's personal First Amendment interests,"" she wrote. The ruling also rejected the government's claim that Mr. Trump operates the account merely in a personal capacity, concluding that he ""uses the account to take actions that can be taken only by the president as president."" Judge Buchwald, however, did dismiss Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, and Hope Hicks, the former communications director, as defendants because Ms. Sanders does not have access to the account and Ms. Hicks no longer works in the administration. Mr. Jaffer said Mr. Trump or Mr. Scavino should simply unblock the users. If they do not, the next step could be to seek an injunction. (Judge Buchwald mentioned that possibility, writing that ""injunctive relief directed at Scavino"" was one of the options that ""remain available."")

""The position the Trump administration is taking is that the president is entitled to block people, and that the court lacks the ability to order him to do otherwise,"" Mr. Jaffer said. ""The right thing for the president and his social media director to do would be to log into the president's account and unblock everyone who has been blocked on the basis of viewpoint."" 

 There have been other legal cases involving public officials and their social media activity. In April, Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland settled a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland and several other plaintiffs who accused him of censorship on government-operated Facebook pages. A similar federal lawsuit filed against Gov. Paul R. LePage of Maine is awaiting a ruling. In a March hearing, Judge Buchwald had suggested that Mr. Trump has the right to ignore whomever he pleases on Twitter, and that the ""Mute"" feature is a constitutional option for doing so. Using that feature would hide selected users' posts from Mr. Trump's view. She urged the two parties to consider that possibility as a way to settle the matter. But the president's preference for blocking -- which renders Twitter users unable to interact directly with his posts, or with other users in the space beneath those posts -- amounts to barring Americans from a public forum, in the judge's view. Indeed, many of the tweets for which users were blocked were attempts to join the sprawling conversations that take place around the president's feed. Nick Pappas, a comic and writer, was blocked after replying to the president in June. Mr. Trump had tweeted, ""The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version!"" Mr. Pappas replied: ""Trump is right. The government should protect the people. That's why the courts are protecting us from him."" Another plaintiff, Rebecca Buckwalter, who is now an editor for the left-leaning website The Daily Kos, was blocked for replying to a June tweet from Mr. Trump that read, ""Sorry folks, but if I would have relied on the Fake News of CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, washpost or nytimes, I would have had ZERO chance winning WH."" ""To be fair you didn't win the WH: Russia won it for you,"" Ms. Buckwalter tweeted, shortly before being blocked. After Wednesday's ruling, she took to Twitter again: ""I sued the President, and I won.""",A federal judge in Manhattan ruled on Wednesday that President Trump's practice of blocking Twitter users who criticize him is unconstitutional.,a15932df-63da-5ef3-b413-55c34b578c00,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/24/business/24trumptwitter-jump-print/24TRUMPBLOCK-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=df04e9e20c496edb3ff8d78f3c8196fadd72bb5cedcd77436360183ab8464049&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,President Trump has 52 million followers on Twitter.

Their complaint argued that Mr. Trump's feed amounted to a ""digital town hall"" where not only did the president and his aides communicate information but members of the public -- by replying to Mr. Trump's tweets and others who responded to him -- exchanged views with one another. By blocking particular people from viewing or replying to message chains because they had expressed views he did not like, it argued, Mr. Trump had violated their First Amendment rights. Judge Buchwald, who was appointed to the federal bench in 1999 by President Bill Clinton, agreed. ""The viewpoint-based exclusion of the individual plaintiffs from that designated public forum is proscribed by the First Amendment and cannot be justified by the president's personal First Amendment interests,"" she wrote. The ruling also rejected the government's claim that Mr. Trump operates the account merely in a personal capacity, concluding that he ""uses the account to take actions that can be taken only by the president as president."" Judge Buchwald, however, did dismiss Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, and Hope Hicks, the former communications director, as defendants because Ms. Sanders does not have access to the account and Ms. Hicks no longer works in the administration. Mr. Jaffer said Mr. Trump or Mr. Scavino should simply unblock the users. If they do not, the next step could be to seek an injunction. (Judge Buchwald mentioned that possibility, writing that ""injunctive relief directed at Scavino"" was one of the options that ""remain available."")

""The position the Trump administration is taking is that the president is entitled to block people, and that the court lacks the ability to order him to do otherwise,"" Mr. Jaffer said. ""The right thing for the president and his social media director to do would be to log into the president's account and unblock everyone who has been blocked on the basis of viewpoint."" 

 There have been other legal cases involving public officials and their social media activity. In April, Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland settled a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland and several other plaintiffs who accused him of censorship on government-operated Facebook pages. A similar federal lawsuit filed against Gov. Paul R. LePage of Maine is awaiting a ruling. In a March hearing, Judge Buchwald had suggested that Mr. Trump has the right to ignore whomever he pleases on Twitter, and that the ""Mute"" feature is a constitutional option for doing so. Using that feature would hide selected users' posts from Mr. Trump's view. She urged the two parties to consider that possibility as a way to settle the matter. But the president's preference for blocking -- which renders Twitter users unable to interact directly with his posts, or with other users in the space beneath those posts -- amounts to barring Americans from a public forum, in the judge's view. Indeed, many of the tweets for which users were blocked were attempts to join the sprawling conversations that take place around the president's feed. Nick Pappas, a comic and writer, was blocked after replying to the president in June. Mr. Trump had tweeted, ""The Justice Dept. should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court - & seek much tougher version!"" Mr. Pappas replied: ""Trump is right. The government should protect the people. That's why the courts are protecting us from him."" Another plaintiff, Rebecca Buckwalter, who is now an editor for the left-leaning website The Daily Kos, was blocked for replying to a June tweet from Mr. Trump that read, ""Sorry folks, but if I would have relied on the Fake News of CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, washpost or nytimes, I would have had ZERO chance winning WH."" ""To be fair you didn't win the WH: Russia won it for you,"" Ms. Buckwalter tweeted, shortly before being blocked. After Wednesday's ruling, she took to Twitter again: ""I sued the President, and I won."" A federal judge in Manhattan ruled on Wednesday that President Trump's practice of blocking Twitter users who criticize him is unconstitutional.",,"Trump's Blocking of Twitter Users Is Unconstitutional, Judge Says Apart from the man himself, perhaps nothing has defined President Trump's political persona more than Twitter. But on Wednesday, one of Mr. Trump's Twitter habits -- his practice of blocking critics on the service, preventing them from engaging with his account -- was declared unconstitutional by a federal judge in Manhattan. Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald, addressing a novel issue about how the Constitution applies to social media platforms and public officials, found that the president's Twitter feed is a public forum. As a result, she ruled that when Mr. Trump or an aide blocked seven plaintiffs from viewing and replying to his posts, he violated the First Amendment. If the principle undergirding Wednesday's ruling in Federal District Court stands, it is likely to have implications far beyond Mr. Trump's feed and its 52 million followers, said Jameel Jaffer, the Knight First Amendment Institute's executive director and the counsel for the plaintiffs. Public officials throughout the country, from local politicians to governors and members of Congress, regularly use social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook to interact with the public about government business.

[Read more: Twitter users talk about getting blocked by the president.] ""This ruling should put them on notice, and if they censor critics from social media accounts used for official purposes, they run the risk that someone will sue them and win,"" he said of public officials. Asked whether the administration would unblock the users or appeal the ruling, Kerri Kupec, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department's civil division, demurred from making any specific pronouncement. ""We respectfully disagree with the court's decision and are considering our next steps,"" she said. In her ruling, Judge Buchwald said Mr. Trump and Dan Scavino, the White House social media director, ""exert governmental control over certain aspects of the @realDonaldTrump account."" But she did not issue an injunction ordering Mr. Trump or Mr. Scavino to unblock the users, a nod to the separation-of-powers sensitivities of a judge's ordering a president to do something. Rather, her ruling simply declared what the Constitution requires, with the expectation that the White House would comply. ""Because no government official is above the law and because all government officials are presumed to follow the law once the judiciary has said what the law is, we must assume that the president and Scavino will remedy the blocking we have held to be unconstitutional,"" she wrote in her ruling.

The plaintiffs had argued that Mr. Trump's Twitter feed is an official government account and that blocking users from following it is a violation of their First Amendment rights. In June, the plaintiffs had sent a letter to the White House asking to be unblocked. When that went ignored, they sued.

Movies,"In 'Abominable,' Asian Actors Play Asian Characters. What a Novelty.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/movies/abominable-asian-americans.html,"When I first heard about ""Abominable,"" the animated movie centered on a modern Chinese family, I opened IMDb.com on my phone to look up the cast. I grimaced at the name of the actress playing the movie's main character: Chloe Bennet. I showed my phone to my wife and said, ""Can you believe it? Hollywood has done it again. This is a movie about some kids in China rescuing a yeti, and the actor playing the main character isn't even Asian."" My wife, also Asian-American, was quick to set the record straight. ""Actually, that's Chloe Wang,"" she said. ""She's pretty cool."" She went on to explain that Wang was the half-Chinese, half-white actress known for being outspoken about Hollywood's racism toward Asian-Americans. Casting directors had rarely considered her for roles until she started using Bennet (her father's first name). My rage immediately melted into embarrassment, then appreciation. In an industry in which we're scarcely represented -- 3.4 percent of film roles went to Asian-Americans in 2017, according to a Hollywood diversity report by University of California, Los Angeles -- here was a big-studio movie with Chinese characters voiced mainly by Asian-Americans , an occurrence as rare as a solar eclipse. The last time I could remember this happening was more than 20 years ago with Disney's ""Mulan.""

In interviews, the makers of ""Abominable"" said their mission was to achieve authenticity. The director, Jill Culton, who had worked on ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Monsters, Inc.,"" described how her team went to great lengths to accurately portray Chinese culture, weaving in details like the Shanghai-inspired city's use of rubber trash cans (instead of metal), and the children's favorite snack, steamed pork buns. So there was no question that the Chinese characters should be voiced by people of Asian heritage, Culton added. ""I would never want a Caucasian actor representing a Chinese character,"" she said. ""You're trying to represent a different culture, and when you do that, especially as a director, you have to tread carefully.""

Yet in the past that wasn't the road taken by some directors. The last big-budget Hollywood animation featuring an Asian family was ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" in 2016, which featured the voices of Art Parkinson, Charlize Theron and Matthew McConaughey. (At the time, the director Travis Knight said that while he believed inclusion and representation mattered, voice acting involved different considerations.) More controversial was the 2017 live-action adaptation of the Japanese anime ""Ghost in the Shell,"" with Scarlett Johansson as Major Killian, better known as Major Kusanagi in the original. A year before that, the Marvel blockbuster ""Doctor Strange"" featured Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, who was an Asian man in the source material. Asian-Americans make up the fastest-growing demographic in the United States, according to the Pew Research Center. So why is the group barely visible on the big screen?

Donatella Galella, a professor of theater history and theory at the University of California, Riverside, said that the issue has its roots in American theater. The lack of Asians -- and their marginalized roles -- onstage may have been a symptom of the Western world's xenophobia in the late 1800s and onward . Galella pointed to the Russo-Japanese war in 1905, in which the Japanese defeated the Russians, as a key historical event that stoked fear about East Asians posing a threat to the West. During that era, when more Chinese were immigrating to the United States, some plays portrayed Asian characters in minor roles -- often as villains, Galella said. Other plays characterized Asian men as effeminate and desexualized, stemming from the societal fear that they would reproduce with white women and pose an existential threat to the race. (Around this time, the United States enacted laws that could strip a white woman of her citizenship if she married an Asian man. )

On American stages today, important feeders for Hollywood, Asians are still underrepresented. Only 7.3 percent of acting roles on Broadway and at New York's largest nonprofit theaters went to people of Asian heritage in the 2016-17 season, according to the Asian-American Performers Coalition, a grass-roots organization seeking to expand representation onstage. (Asian-Americans make up 12.7 percent of New York's population.) Darnell Hunt, a sociology professor at U.C.L.A. who leads the university's Hollywood diversity report, said the lack of Asian-American representation on the big screen is also a reflection of the lack of minorities in Hollywood's executive roles. At major studios, the key decision makers who greenlight projects are mostly white men. If more people of color were in those positions, they would probably have different perceptions about what viewers want, like minority actors in major roles, he said. Case in point: Kevin Tsujihara, the former head of Warner Bros., was the first executive of Asian descent to run a big Hollywood studio, and he played an important role in fast-tracking the production of ""Crazy Rich Asians."" (He resigned this year amid accusations that he promised an actress auditions in exchange for sex.) Hunt added that it was too soon to predict whether movies like ""Crazy Rich Asians"" or ""Abominable"" would affect representation in the long term. He noted that he had not seen an increase in the number of Asian-Americans in Hollywood's executive suites. ""Asian-Americans have not been at the table,"" he said. Bennet said that she was hopeful that ""Abominable"" would help accelerate her career. But she was uncertain about whether this movie, along with the string of recent hits with Asian-American casts, was a watershed moment.

""Abominable"" underlines what can result from a diverse set of people behind the scenes. The movie was a co-production between the American studio DreamWorks Animation and China's Pearl Studio. One of the producers, Peilin Chou, said she and the rest of the team worked diligently to cast actors of Asian descent. In addition to Bennet as Yi, the heroine, the chief supporting characters, Peng and Jin, were voiced by Asian-American actors, Albert Tsai and Tenzing Trainor. ""From moment one it was something that was born of two cultures, and I think that right there was a foundation of how we wanted to approach this film,"" Chou said. What ""Abominable"" lacks, however, is a big celebrity name to help sell tickets. Bennet is not well-known outside of her role in the TV show ""Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" Even lesser known are Tsai and Trainor, who have TV roles in ""Fresh Off the Boat"" and ""Clueless."" It's unclear whether the lack of a star in ""Abominable"" will affect its financial success. But Chou, the producer, said there was a chicken-and-egg problem: If the major studios only want to cast celebrities to attract audiences, how will Asian-Americans ever gain fame if they don't get a chance to be onscreen?

Television,Why the Creator of 'Dear White People' Is Doubling Down on Identity Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/arts/television/dear-white-people-creator-doubles-down-on-identity-politics.html,"Justin Simien, the creator of the movie and Netflix show ""Dear White People,"" sees the role of the storyteller as giving people something they haven't seen before or showing them how to think in a new way.

Justin Simien, the 35-year-old creator of ""Dear White People,"" is no stranger to provocation. The satirical comedy, first a movie and now a Netflix show, revolves around five black students -- Sam, Coco, Troy, Lionel and Reggie -- at a fictional elite university who revel in the sorts of intemperate and intoxicating polemics that can sour a Thanksgiving dinner. A story line from the first season about an app called ""Woke or Not,"" for example, mercilessly parodied the characters' self-conscious commitment to social justice. But even Mr. Simien was not prepared for the controversy that engulfed the TV show's rollout. After Netflix first released a teaser trailer last February, Mr. Simien was inundated with critical messages online, promoting the hashtag #BoycottNetflix and excoriating him for ""reverse racism."" ""I read this review on some conservative site because I was so curious where it all was coming from,"" Mr. Simien recalled in an interview at the Netflix offices in Manhattan late last month. ""It was like they'd watched the show just enough to give their readers the impression that they'd watched it and then came up with the most insane interpretations. It wasn't that they didn't get it, it was that they refused to get it.""

Mr. Simien, who speaks in paragraphs and variously quoted Malcolm X, Eckhart Tolle and RuPaul, discussed why the new season never mentions President Trump by name, what black auteurs owe to their audiences and his upcoming horror film about a (literal) killer weave. ""Any chance you get as a storyteller to make people see something that they never saw before, or to think in a new way -- that's the job,"" he said. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. There was some controversy over the title of the show last season, and this season the Sam character, who hosts a radio show within the show, also called ""Dear White People,"" deals with her own similar controversy. How did you digest all of the feedback from Season 1? The backlash stuff was really interesting to me. They were so organized and they didn't just come after us, they came after anything black -- there were campaigns against ""Black Panther,"" too. I was so curious about it and I did a deep dive and started to try to figure out what were the tactics that they used and how were they so mobilized.

The other big thing that informed this season was that Trump won on the day we wrapped Season 1. And I was just so bewildered by how we got here. I started to really research and not just assume that I knew. I read a book called ""The History of White People,"" about all of the cultural decisions that led to the creation of the white race and why white is the ideal form of beauty, and it's so arbitrary. I realized that the reason we can't talk to each other is because people don't know where this all comes from. So this season has a lot of history on its mind, too.

When you're investigating those questions on the show, do you worry that white people will just choose not to engage? I think the key to the show is making you care about the characters first, because it's not a thesis. And if we tell the truth about what they're going through, then maybe you'll care and think about it. I think the show has two goals. One is to allow people who don't necessarily look like us to see themselves in characters they don't expect to, so that the next time they see a black guy at Starbucks, they won't feel the need to call the cops on him. And the other thing is to make people who've actually gone through these experiences go: ""Oh my God, totally. I'm so glad someone finally put it that way."" I think both of those things allow black folks to feel more human in society.

What do you make of the idea that obsessive focus on identity is inherently divisive, and that minorities would be better served by a politics that focuses on what we all have in common? I think people who are privileged can say something like that. Because the truth is, I could walk around all day saying: ""I don't identify with being black. I don't identify with being gay."" But you know what's going to happen to me? Society's going to happen to me. I'm going to go into Starbucks and get arrested, or I'm going to walk through the wrong neighborhood in a hoodie. When you don't have to have the burden of identity, when you don't have to code switch every day or constantly be aware of your surroundings, you get to say that. Part of the reason the show is called ""Dear White People"" is because there's no way to be black in America without constantly having to explain or protect or defend yourself. Talking about that is not why Donald Trump is president. The new season doesn't mention Trump by name. Why not? I just didn't want to say his name. I didn't want to give it that kind of power. I think the underlying issues that brought about the Trump presidency are American issues, and they've been around before Trump and they'll be around after Trump.

He is African. And his accent is based on an actual Kenyan accent, but people thought it was too sing-songy. So we brought in the woman who was the dialect coach for ""Black Panther"" to give it some flavor and some nuance. But I'm sure people will still be mad. Here's the thing about being a black creator: [Scrutiny] is part of being in the ring. Black folks and the black diaspora are so starved for content that when you're the only person telling the story there's all these people that are like, ""Well where's my story?"" I remember reading this article about how ""Black Panther"" had failed the queer community by not expressing LGBT issues. And I was like, but it did so many things! It's literally changed cinema for black people forever, and was an all-black cast, and made all the money in the world, and introduced African themes, and is opening in Saudia Arabia ... but we didn't have gay characters. So let's just throw the whole thing away. That kind of thing can be a lot. But it's the cost of telling stories in an oppressive society. You have to be prepared to take some of those jabs and you do the best that you can. Your next movie, ""Bad Hair,"" is about a woman who's possessed by a sentient killer weave. Where'd you get the idea? I always write because I'm really angry about something, and I was so angry that people weren't seeing how black women are getting it from all angles. [If you're a black woman,] you're at the bottom of the totem pole, even though black women are always among the strongest members of our society and culture. I was also really inspired by Korean horror movies, because hair possession is a subgenre there. I was just thinking, ""How would we do this in America?""

Dance,"Review: In 'Bladder Inn,' Waiting for Dancers to Wander Away",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/arts/dance/review-in-bladder-inn-waiting-for-dancers-to-wander-away.html,"What if a group of dancers, mid-performance, just wandered away and didn't come back? On Thursday at Danspace Project, during the premiere of Mina Nishimura's ""Bladder Inn (and X, Y, Z, W),"" such a development often seemed imminent. In a loosely knit hourlong show that spilled from the sanctuary of St. Mark's Church into its back rooms and balconies, Ms. Nishimura, one of eight dancers, created not so much a world as an atmosphere, a web of activity on the brink of dissolving.

An entrancing performer in her own work and others' -- like that of her husband, Kota Yamazaki, and the choreographer Dean Moss -- Ms. Nishimura can't help but be a focal point onstage. (Mr. Moss's ""Petra,"" just last week, included a brilliant autobiographical monologue that she wrote and delivered.) She doesn't demand attention, she just attracts it, in part through her ability to embody multiple qualities at the same time. An action as simple as walking becomes riveting through the illusion of a floating torso supported by weighted, wooden legs. Details as fine as a corner of the mouth, isolated and upturned while the opposite corner rests, spring into view. Often she appears animated, spookily, by forces outside of herself.

Like other dancer-choreographers with distinctive ways of moving, Ms. Nishimura faces the challenge of translating that style onto fellow performers. In ""Bladder Inn"" (what to make of the title?), no one quite matches her strange interiority and specificity. But rather than fighting that difference, she folds it into the format of the work. The piece takes shape as a suite of concurrent solos, each dancer roaming around on his or her own phantomlike terms: crawling backward through open doors, grazing bare walls, staggering out from hallways and stairwells we can't see.

The house lights, for the most part, stay up. Distant murmurs and slamming doors mingle with the clacking and oceanic undulations in Masahiro Sugaya's unobtrusive score. So do the dancers' vocalizations, like Jonathan Burklund yelling ""Hey!"" in time with the flick of a hand, or Samuel Hanson howling, or Lydia Chrisman singing a few crystal-clear notes.","Mina Nishimura's new work at Danspace creates not so much a world, but an atmosphere, a web of activity on the brink of dissolving.",c1dc317a-a190-59da-bb2d-b17d0617c8a0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/03/arts/03NISHIMURA-REVIEW/03NISHIMURA-REVIEW-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=e95a3fd17ccbe6d1162820af2f2ee0bf24d381037ad6b2130b8639981993a624&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mina Nishimura in her ""Bladder Inn (X, Y, Z, W).""",c1dc317a-a190-59da-bb2d-b17d0617c8a0,Demo_data/D1_img2/1c1dc317a-a190-59da-bb2d-b17d0617c8a0.jpg,6,"Review: In 'Bladder Inn,' Waiting for Dancers to Wander Away What if a group of dancers, mid-performance, just wandered away and didn't come back?

So do the dancers' vocalizations, like Jonathan Burklund yelling ""Hey!"" in time with the flick of a hand, or Samuel Hanson howling, or Lydia Chrisman singing a few crystal-clear notes.

Science,"How Universities Deal With Sexual Harassment Needs Sweeping Change, Panel Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/science/sexual-harassment-science-medicine-engineering.html,"Years of efforts to prevent sexual harassment in science, engineering and medicine have failed, and universities need to make sweeping changes in the way they deal with the issue, a searing new report by a national advisory panel concluded on Tuesday. ""There is no evidence to suggest that current policies, procedures, and approaches have resulted in a significant reduction in sexual harassment,"" said the report, which was more than two years in the making, starting well before the #MeToo era. It was issued by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, independent agencies that advise the government and the public. The panel offered 15 detailed recommendations, some of which would upend long-entrenched practices in academia. Institutions should overhaul their academic advising systems, for example, it said, so students and junior researchers are not dependent on one senior researcher for advancement and access to grants. The report also urged legislators to pass laws so people can file harassment lawsuits directly against faculty and not just the university, and so employees who settle harassment complaints cannot keep them confidential from another prospective academic employer.

The 311-page document is the national academies' first report addressing sexual harassment, a problem that has long simmered in labs and classrooms, and some people predicted it could help spur meaningful change. ""Reports from the National Academy carry substantial weight,"" said Dr. Carol Bates, associate dean for faculty affairs at Harvard Medical School and a co-author of a recent article calling for ""zero tolerance for sexual harassment in academic medicine."" But, she noted, ""none of it is easy or we would have fixed it already. We haven't fixed it in any other domain in society either."" Academic workplaces are second only to the military in the rate of sexual harassment, with 58 percent of academic employees indicating they had such experiences, according to one study cited in the report. Among the data involving students in scientific fields, the report cited a 2017 survey by the University of Texas system, which found that about 20 percent of female science students, more than 25 percent of female engineering students and more than 40 percent of female medical students experienced sexual harassment from faculty or staff members. The issue is also a sensitive one for the National Academies because some of their own members have been found to have committed sexual misconduct at their universities. Responding to questions at a briefing on the report, Bruce Darling, the executive officer of the academies, said the institutions were considering trying to oust members who committed harassment, but doing so would require a lengthy process dependent on voting by members, so other measures are being considered in the interim.

The panel said universities and other institutions have been too focused on ""symbolic compliance with current law and avoiding liability and not on preventing sexual harassment."" Fear of being held liable may have kept many institutions from even evaluating their prevention programs, the report asserted; if they did, ""they would likely find them to be ineffective."" ""We really have to move beyond a mind-set of legal compliance and liability and think about the ways we can change the climate,"" said Dr. Paula A. Johnson, the president of Wellesley College and a co-chairwoman of the committee that produced the report, in an interview. Dr. Paula A. Johnson, the president of Wellesley College, co-chaired the committee that produced the report. The committee identified three types of sexual harassment: sexual coercion, unwanted sexual attention and gender harassment. It said gender harassment, ""verbal and nonverbal behaviors that convey hostility, objectification, exclusion or second-class status,"" was by far the most common type women experienced. ""As opposed to the come-ons, you can kind of think of them as the put-downs,"" said Dr. Johnson, who is also a cardiologist and former chief of the women's health division at Brigham and Women's Hospital. She said gender harassment creates a culture that fosters the other types of sexual harassment. The committee said gender harassment was more pervasive in medicine than in the other sciences, partly because harassment can come from patients, as well as colleagues. In any form, the costs for women -- and for the ability of scientific fields to retain the full range of talented people -- can be great, even if the consequences can seem subtle at first, the panel said.

It ""undermines work and well-being in a whole host of ways,"" triggering symptoms like depression, sleep disruption, cardiac stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder, said Lilia Cortina, a panel member and professor of psychology and women's studies at the University of Michigan. She said experiences can be worse for women of color and lesbian, bisexual or transgender women. But they also affect witnesses to the behavior, further impeding the scientific work. ""Women leave, their co-workers leave, even the men leave -- they don't' stick around to watch their valued colleagues being disparaged and they certainly don't want to become the next victim,"" Dr. Cortina said during the briefing. One paradox is that academia's emphasis on merit-based advancement can discourage women from reporting harassment and limit their career progress, the committee noted. ""The system of meritocracy does not account for the declines in productivity and morale as a result of sexual harassment,"" says the report. ""It can make her question her own scientific worth. Additionally, it can make scientific achievement feel like it is not worth it."" That may partly explain another paradox. ""There are more women in these fields, yet there's still sexual harassment,"" said Elizabeth L. Hillman, a committee member who is president of Mills College and an expert on sexual assault in the military. Billy Williams, a committee member and director of science for the American Geophysical Union, said simply complying with laws like Title IX has not worked because the laws assume women will file formal complaints, when fears of retaliation have made that ""the least common response."" As a result, Dr. Johnson said, universities should establish less formal ways for women to report their experiences. The report did not evaluate investigative processes, imposing discipline or the rights of accused harassers, except to say that procedures and consequences should be fair to all sides. The panel said institutions should adopt training programs that focus on changing behavior, not beliefs. The programs should be evaluated for effectiveness and ""not be based on the avoidance of legal liability."" When institutions survey people about their experiences with sexual harassment, they should use validated questionnaires and ""avoid specifically using the term 'sexual harassment'"" in the questions.

Books,How Langston Hughes Brought His Radical Vision to the Novel,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/books/review/angela-flournoy-langston-hughes-not-without-laughter.html,"For a writer like , who made a name for himself as a poet before the age of 21, his debut novel, ""Not Without Laughter,"" feels like an effort to stake out a bigger claim on his abilities, to create artistic and thematic breathing room. Arna Bontemps, celebrated poet and friend to Hughes, described ""Not Without Laughter"" as the novel that both Hughes and his readers knew he had to write, coming as it did on the heels of Hughes's two well-received poetry collections, ""The Weary Blues"" (1926) and ""Fine Clothes to the Jew"" (1927). Hughes published these collections while a student at Lincoln University, and he released ""Not Without Laughter"" in 1930, shortly after graduating. ""By the date of his first book of prose Hughes had become for many a symbol of the black renaissance,"" Bontemps writes. The stakes were high, then, for the young man born in Joplin, Mo. He had to deliver. ""Not Without Laughter"" crystallizes some of the themes introduced in Hughes's first two poetry collections and examines in detail subjects he would return to throughout his decades-long career, among them the experiences of working-class and poor blacks, the importance of black music to black life, the beauty of black language and the trap of respectability. It begins as a tale of family life, following the Williamses -- the matriarch, Aunt Hager; her daughters, Harriet, Annjee (Annjelica) and Tempy; and Annjee's husband, Jimboy -- in the small Kansas town of Stanton. After establishing the conflicts and desires of the adults, the narrative becomes a bildungsroman. Here it finds its true purpose: chronicling the upbringing of Sandy, the son of Jimboy and Annjee, as he struggles to forge an identity outside of the boxes the white and black worlds have put him in, and tries to find stability within his increasingly unstable home. Each family member provides an example of how Sandy might navigate his world. Sandy's father is a blues man, a guitar picker with an itch for traveling, who leaves his wife and his son for months on end. Sandy's mother works long hours as a domestic for an exacting white woman and comes home so exhausted and lovesick that she doesn't have much attention to spare for her young son. Soon enough she leaves Stanton for good, determined to stay by Jimboy's side and find happiness in their reunion. Aunt Hager is Sandy's primary caretaker, and it is her grandson in whom she invests all her hopes for her family line: ""I's gwine raise one chile right yet, if de Lawd lets me live -- just one chile right!"" In an unkind light Hager can be read as a Mammy, a former slave who chose to stay by her mistress's side for several years after emancipation rather than ""scatter like buckshot,"" as most freed people did, and who now washes the clothes of white people and tends to their illnesses when called. Hughes takes care to flesh out Hager's motivations, which prove to be more complicated than unblinking servitude. Hager finds sanity and solace in forgiveness, in assuming the best in people who are too ignorant to reciprocate that courtesy. Her benevolence is her own existential armor. Hate ""closes up de sweet door to life an' makes ever'thing small an' mean an' dirty,"" Hager insists. Her beliefs stand in stark contrast to those of many other negroes, including her own children.

Hager's youngest daughter, Harriet, is beautiful, and has a voice made to sing the blues. She gives her mother and Annjee's way of life a chance -- working at a country club where old white men make passes at her -- but ultimately opts out, hoping to escape Stanton altogether. She runs away with the carnival,then returns to town and dabbles in sex work before finally getting a break as a singer. Her story begins as one of classic teenage rebellion but ends as an example of fierce determination. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

In his famous essay ""The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain,"" Hughes expresses fondness for ""the low-down folks, the so-called common element."" Poor African-Americans made up a majority of the black population but were rarely depicted as fully realized characters in the serious literature of the day. ""They furnish a wealth of colorful, distinctive material for any artist because they still hold their own individuality in the face of American standardizations,"" Hughes writes. A writer who extols the virtues of a group of people based on any demographic denominator runs the risk of flattening or essentializing his characters, but in the face of popular novels centered on middle- and upper-class black experiences, such as those by his contemporary Jessie Redmon Fauset, Hughes's call for nuanced consideration of working-class (and even out-of-work) black people was noteworthy. The early decades of the 20th century were also a period when ""color mania"" was part of day-to-day black social and professional life, with lighter skin seen as correlating with increased romantic prospects and more opportunities for upward mobility. Hughes's focus on main characters with darker skin tones -- something we are reminded of throughout the novel -- seems like a conscious statement against racial assimilation and conformity. In reviewing Hughes's first autobiography, ""The Big Sea"" (1940), Richard Wright recalls Hughes's first two poetry collections being greeted with shock by the black reading public. ""Since then the realistic position assumed by Hughes has become the dominant outlook of all those Negro writers who have something to say,"" Wright observes. Indeed what stays with the reader longer than the overall narrative arc of ""Not Without Laughter"" is the frequent, unexpected uses of imagery and language that make the characters and their lives feel real. Sandy recalls Aunt Hager, a woman who frowns on secular dancing -- even if that dancing takes place in her own yard -- whirling round and round at a revival in religious ecstasy. With the same amount of fondness he recalls his aunt Harriet ""balling-the-jack"" to Jimboy's guitar music in the yard. Both Aunt Hager and Sister Johnson tend to pronounce the word ""idea"" as ""idee,"" a subtle nod to what the historian Henry Louis Gates Jr. calls ""the linguistic legacy of slavery."" During conversations between black characters, the word ""nigger"" rolls off their tongues often -- sometimes pejoratively, sometimes humorously, but more often as a general descriptor -- and it's a testament to Hughes's ear for black language that we are never in doubt about the intended tone. This focus on rendering realistically how black folks behave among themselves, whether or not such behavior would be considered proper in other contexts, is one of the novel's greatest achievements. Like his one-time collaborator and contemporary Zora Neale Hurston, Hughes takes an anthropological approach to setting and character development. The town of Stanton where ""Not Without Laughter"" is set is similar to Lawrence, the small Kansas town where Hughes grew up with his maternal grandmother while his father worked in Mexico and his mother lived in Topeka. It was the sort of place where blacks and whites might live in close proximity to one another, but where a black boy would avoid walking by his white neighbor's front lawn for fear of having insults and slurs -- or worse -- hurled at him. Like the novel's hero, Sandy, Hughes grew up with a largely absent father and an interest in books. Already a budding public figure by the time of the novel's release, Hughes likely saw his own life pulling him farther and farther away from the small-town Midwestern world that raised him. Reading ""Not Without Laughter,"" one can't help feeling as if Hughes had a desperate need to get all of his early cultural memories down on paper, from the ""sooty gray-green light"" that turns to blackness before a tornado touches down, to the possum, peach preserves and yams that make up a humble Thanksgiving dinner.

Sandy is an ideal protagonist for a novel so interested in place and culture -- an observant boy with a penchant for finding the extraordinary in the ordinary. He listens intently during warm nights spent on the porch with Aunt Hager, with an occasional visit from Sister Johnson or the speechifying Madam de Carter. He overhears grown black folks parsing out the psychology of whites who want to keep blacks close to them -- nursing their children, preparing their meals -- but always beneath them, and withholds his own judgment, already wise enough to know he doesn't yet know enough. As a teenager Sandy sweeps up at a neighborhood barbershop, a place ""filled with loud man-talk and smoke and laughter,"" and gets a crude sexual education from the conversations of the shop's day laborer customers and barbers, as well as plenty of lessons in playing the dozens -- ""the protective art of turning back a joke."" He inhabits this new space the same way he inhabits every other one, simultaneously attuned to its peculiarities and somewhat set apart. In ""The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain,"" Hughes addresses the issue of respectability, the belief that promoting only the best, brightest and most palatable forms of blackness might somehow temper white bigotry. ""'Oh, be respectable, write about nice people, show how good we are,' say the Negroes,"" he laments. The respectability argument is so attractive to some that nearly eight decades later it still rears its head with regard to black art and representation. For Sandy, the pressure to be respectable comes from Aunt Tempy, Aunt Hager's oldest child, who avoids visiting her washerwoman mother in an effort to preserve the illusion of her middle-class upbringing. After Hager's death, Sandy moves in with Tempy, and with his usual levelheadedness is able to see the futility of her and her husband's way of thinking: They look down on the Baptist church for its ""nigger music"" but are still made to use the servant's entrance at some of the town's finer white establishments. Sandy is nobody's fool, though: He sees the benefits their lifestyle affords him, like his own room and the freedom to read as much as he wants. ""Not Without Laughter"" is an early Great Migration novel. Many blacks in Kansas arrived from the South after emancipation, and with the advent of automation and the decline of agricultural work, blacks kept traveling north and west in search of opportunities. A migration narrative is necessarily a story of change. The author's task is to replicate the nostalgia and hope his characters feel as they set out for new futures, or the fear, resentment and loneliness of those left behind. Jimboy, the novel's most frequent migrant, sings a song that encapsulates both sides of the experience: I got a mule to ride. I got a mule to ride. Down in the South somewhere. I got a mule to ride. O, don't you leave me here. Babe, don't you leave me here. Dog-gone yo' comin' back! Said don't you leave me here. As a depiction of a period of transition, the migration novel often makes a priority of capturing life as it is led in its very moment, since there's no telling what might change when characters find themselves in new landscapes. The changing way of life between one generation and the next is a persistent point of tension in ""Not Without Laughter."" Aunt Hager pumps water for her laundry washing, as well as for the cooking and cleaning, yet a few miles away Tempy lives with electric lights and indoor plumbing. Hager sees hotels as breeding grounds for vice and sin, but both Harriet and Sandy jump at the chance to work at one, motivated by a paycheck. Hughes uses the songs and dances of Jimboy and Harriet as well as the church revival culture of Hager and Annjee -- in scenes taking place on the same night, less than a half mile apart -- to depict the crossroads between the traditions that have given expression to the community in the past and those that might fill that role in the future. Sandy's father, Jimboy, is caught in a cycle of desiring to be on the road to find better work (and freedom from responsibility) and of nostalgia for the culture and familiarity of the South. Jimboy's wanderlust is offensive to Hager, but Sandy idolizes his father, begging him to teach him how to box and fish and play guitar. The scene of Jimboy about to cut out for the road once again -- this time for good -- is one of the most poignant in the book. Sandy discovers his father ""sitting dejectedly on the well-stoop in the sunshine, with his head in his hands,"" his posture conveying the sort of defeat only a man intending to abandon his family feels. The father takes his son in his arms and kisses him awkwardly. He does not say goodbye. Later that afternoon Sandy discovers Jimboy has left town. What prevents Hughes's characters from being mere archetypes of working-class black folks, or of the Great Migration, is their ability to change and respond to one another. ""Not Without Laughter"" is a novel not without forgiveness. Its characters ultimately prize family over their own ideological resolve, though it takes some longer than others to get there. After hearing news of Harriet's arrest for streetwalking, Hager doesn't speak her daughter's name for some time, but she does not disown her; Hager's dying wish is for Harriet to be happy. Even Tempy's taking in of Sandy can be seen as an attempt to pull her family close again after keeping her distance for so long. The one exception is Jimboy, who remains elusive throughout the novel, a father figure always out of reach. A poet who writes fiction can imbue his prose with a considerable amount of magic. For Hughes, his magic is an appreciation for the lyrics and rhythms of jazz and blues. It's one thing to appreciate the cultural aspects of these musical forms, yet another to home in on the lyrics, the power of the repetition employed therein, the subtle turns of phrase and uses of wit.

""Not Without Laughter"" includes lyrics to songs that are mournful, bawdy, vengeful and downright silly. They underscore the importance Hughes felt they played in black life and consciousness. One gets the sense that Sandy's upbringing has been shaped just as much by overhearing these songs as by Aunt Hager's teachings. As the novel progresses, Sandy's thoughts are rendered in musical streams of consciousness, quickly turning from anticipation to curiosity to anger to desire. The result is a realistic portrayal of the rhythms of a young man's inner life: Sandy lies in bed at night and riffs on his own past and future. In perhaps the most peculiar scene of the novel, Sandy is pursued by a solicitous older man, a ""yellow man with a womanish kind of voice,"" on the streets of Chicago. Sandy quickly ascertains that the man is one of the ""queer fellows"" who try to convince boys to come up to their rooms. The scene ends with Sandy running away, but Hughes writes that Sandy wondered what such men did with the boys they seduced. ""Curious, he'd like to find out -- but he was afraid."" For the time period, to acknowledge homosexual activity, and to allow that it might pique one's interest, was quite rare. The scene would remain one of Hughes's more direct engagements with the topic of homosexuality in his prose until the 1961 short story ""Blessed Assurance."" The tragedy and senselessness of racism is felt throughout ""Not Without Laughter,"" and Hughes takes care to show how it manifests itself in ways small and large. Sandy cries after he overhears Annjee's boss, Mrs. Rice, berate his mother as she packs up leftovers for him. When Sandy and his friends are turned away from the Children's Day Party at the theme park, the other kids talk loudly about the injustice of it, and Sandy just keeps muttering, ""I suppose they didn't mean colored kids,"" a feeble attempt to make sense of a surprising and hurtful situation. His friend Buster plans to pass as white and tells the gang that if one day they should run into him in a big city, to act like they don't know him. Colorism seeps down to every aspect of life, even those moments made for pleasure, as at Benbow's dance: ""'High yallers, draw nigh! Brown-skins, come near!' somebody squalled. 'But black gals, stay where you are!'"" Hughes would not write another novel for nearly 30 years, until 1958, but four years after the publication of ""Not Without Laughter"" he released the story collection ""The Ways of White Folks,"" a series of vignettes about the interaction between white and black people, often with grim, moralistic endings. By this time he had parted ways with his white benefactor Charlotte Mason; his resentment over the split might explain why these stories reach for concrete conclusions that do not similarly burden his novel. ""Not Without Laughter"" is a debut in the best of ways: It covers uncharted territory, it compels its readers to see part of the world anew, and it prizes exploration over pat conclusion. Hughes accesses the universal -- how all of us love and dream and laugh and cry -- by staying faithful to the particulars of his characters and their way of life. With this book the young poet from Joplin, Mo., manages to deliver something more valuable than simply an admirable debut -- he gives his readers and contemporaries a guide for careful consideration of the lives of everyday black people. Such a guide is still useful to readers and writers today. Perhaps now more than ever.","Poor black lives weren't depicted in the serious fiction of Hughes's day.

It begins as a tale of family life, following the Williamses -- the matriarch, Aunt Hager; her daughters, Harriet, Annjee (Annjelica) and Tempy; and Annjee's husband, Jimboy -- in the small Kansas town of Stanton. After establishing the conflicts and desires of the adults, the narrative becomes a bildungsroman. Here it finds its true purpose: chronicling the upbringing of Sandy, the son of Jimboy and Annjee, as he struggles to forge an identity outside of the boxes the white and black worlds have put him in, and tries to find stability within his increasingly unstable home. Each family member provides an example of how Sandy might navigate his world. Sandy's father is a blues man, a guitar picker with an itch for traveling, who leaves his wife and his son for months on end. Sandy's mother works long hours as a domestic for an exacting white woman and comes home so exhausted and lovesick that she doesn't have much attention to spare for her young son. Soon enough she leaves Stanton for good, determined to stay by Jimboy's side and find happiness in their reunion. Aunt Hager is Sandy's primary caretaker, and it is her grandson in whom she invests all her hopes for her family line: ""I's gwine raise one chile right yet, if de Lawd lets me live -- just one chile right!"" In an unkind light Hager can be read as a Mammy, a former slave who chose to stay by her mistress's side for several years after emancipation rather than ""scatter like buckshot,"" as most freed people did, and who now washes the clothes of white people and tends to their illnesses when called. Hughes takes care to flesh out Hager's motivations, which prove to be more complicated than unblinking servitude. Hager finds sanity and solace in forgiveness, in assuming the best in people who are too ignorant to reciprocate that courtesy. Her benevolence is her own existential armor. Hate ""closes up de sweet door to life an' makes ever'thing small an' mean an' dirty,"" Hager insists. Her beliefs stand in stark contrast to those of many other negroes, including her own children.

Hager's youngest daughter, Harriet, is beautiful, and has a voice made to sing the blues. She gives her mother and Annjee's way of life a chance -- working at a country club where old white men make passes at her -- but ultimately opts out, hoping to escape Stanton altogether. She runs away with the carnival,then returns to town and dabbles in sex work before finally getting a break as a singer. Her story begins as one of classic teenage rebellion but ends as an example of fierce determination. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

In his famous essay ""The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain,"" Hughes expresses fondness for ""the low-down folks, the so-called common element."" Poor African-Americans made up a majority of the black population but were rarely depicted as fully realized characters in the serious literature of the day. ""They furnish a wealth of colorful, distinctive material for any artist because they still hold their own individuality in the face of American standardizations,"" Hughes writes. A writer who extols the virtues of a group of people based on any demographic denominator runs the risk of flattening or essentializing his characters, but in the face of popular novels centered on middle- and upper-class black experiences, such as those by his contemporary Jessie Redmon Fauset, Hughes's call for nuanced consideration of working-class (and even out-of-work) black people was noteworthy. The early decades of the 20th century were also a period when ""color mania"" was part of day-to-day black social and professional life, with lighter skin seen as correlating with increased romantic prospects and more opportunities for upward mobility. Hughes's focus on main characters with darker skin tones -- something we are reminded of throughout the novel -- seems like a conscious statement against racial assimilation and conformity. In reviewing Hughes's first autobiography, ""The Big Sea"" (1940), Richard Wright recalls Hughes's first two poetry collections being greeted with shock by the black reading public. ""Since then the realistic position assumed by Hughes has become the dominant outlook of all those Negro writers who have something to say,"" Wright observes. Indeed what stays with the reader longer than the overall narrative arc of ""Not Without Laughter"" is the frequent, unexpected uses of imagery and language that make the characters and their lives feel real. Sandy recalls Aunt Hager, a woman who frowns on secular dancing -- even if that dancing takes place in her own yard -- whirling round and round at a revival in religious ecstasy. With the same amount of fondness he recalls his aunt Harriet ""balling-the-jack"" to Jimboy's guitar music in the yard. Both Aunt Hager and Sister Johnson tend to pronounce the word ""idea"" as ""idee,"" a subtle nod to what the historian Henry Louis Gates Jr. calls ""the linguistic legacy of slavery."" During conversations between black characters, the word ""nigger"" rolls off their tongues often -- sometimes pejoratively, sometimes humorously, but more often as a general descriptor -- and it's a testament to Hughes's ear for black language that we are never in doubt about the intended tone. This focus on rendering realistically how black folks behave among themselves, whether or not such behavior would be considered proper in other contexts, is one of the novel's greatest achievements. Like his one-time collaborator and contemporary Zora Neale Hurston, Hughes takes an anthropological approach to setting and character development. The town of Stanton where ""Not Without Laughter"" is set is similar to Lawrence, the small Kansas town where Hughes grew up with his maternal grandmother while his father worked in Mexico and his mother lived in Topeka. It was the sort of place where blacks and whites might live in close proximity to one another, but where a black boy would avoid walking by his white neighbor's front lawn for fear of having insults and slurs -- or worse -- hurled at him. Like the novel's hero, Sandy, Hughes grew up with a largely absent father and an interest in books. Already a budding public figure by the time of the novel's release, Hughes likely saw his own life pulling him farther and farther away from the small-town Midwestern world that raised him. Reading ""Not Without Laughter,"" one can't help feeling as if Hughes had a desperate need to get all of his early cultural memories down on paper, from the ""sooty gray-green light"" that turns to blackness before a tornado touches down, to the possum, peach preserves and yams that make up a humble Thanksgiving dinner.

Sandy is an ideal protagonist for a novel so interested in place and culture -- an observant boy with a penchant for finding the extraordinary in the ordinary. He listens intently during warm nights spent on the porch with Aunt Hager, with an occasional visit from Sister Johnson or the speechifying Madam de Carter. He overhears grown black folks parsing out the psychology of whites who want to keep blacks close to them -- nursing their children, preparing their meals -- but always beneath them, and withholds his own judgment, already wise enough to know he doesn't yet know enough. As a teenager Sandy sweeps up at a neighborhood barbershop, a place ""filled with loud man-talk and smoke and laughter,"" and gets a crude sexual education from the conversations of the shop's day laborer customers and barbers, as well as plenty of lessons in playing the dozens -- ""the protective art of turning back a joke."" He inhabits this new space the same way he inhabits every other one, simultaneously attuned to its peculiarities and somewhat set apart. In ""The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain,"" Hughes addresses the issue of respectability, the belief that promoting only the best, brightest and most palatable forms of blackness might somehow temper white bigotry. ""'Oh, be respectable, write about nice people, show how good we are,' say the Negroes,"" he laments. The respectability argument is so attractive to some that nearly eight decades later it still rears its head with regard to black art and representation. For Sandy, the pressure to be respectable comes from Aunt Tempy, Aunt Hager's oldest child, who avoids visiting her washerwoman mother in an effort to preserve the illusion of her middle-class upbringing. After Hager's death, Sandy moves in with Tempy, and with his usual levelheadedness is able to see the futility of her and her husband's way of thinking: They look down on the Baptist church for its ""nigger music"" but are still made to use the servant's entrance at some of the town's finer white establishments. Sandy is nobody's fool, though: He sees the benefits their lifestyle affords him, like his own room and the freedom to read as much as he wants. ""Not Without Laughter"" is an early Great Migration novel. Many blacks in Kansas arrived from the South after emancipation, and with the advent of automation and the decline of agricultural work, blacks kept traveling north and west in search of opportunities. A migration narrative is necessarily a story of change. The author's task is to replicate the nostalgia and hope his characters feel as they set out for new futures, or the fear, resentment and loneliness of those left behind. Jimboy, the novel's most frequent migrant, sings a song that encapsulates both sides of the experience: I got a mule to ride. I got a mule to ride. Down in the South somewhere. I got a mule to ride. O, don't you leave me here. Babe, don't you leave me here. Dog-gone yo' comin' back! Said don't you leave me here. As a depiction of a period of transition, the migration novel often makes a priority of capturing life as it is led in its very moment, since there's no telling what might change when characters find themselves in new landscapes. The changing way of life between one generation and the next is a persistent point of tension in ""Not Without Laughter."" Aunt Hager pumps water for her laundry washing, as well as for the cooking and cleaning, yet a few miles away Tempy lives with electric lights and indoor plumbing. Hager sees hotels as breeding grounds for vice and sin, but both Harriet and Sandy jump at the chance to work at one, motivated by a paycheck. Hughes uses the songs and dances of Jimboy and Harriet as well as the church revival culture of Hager and Annjee -- in scenes taking place on the same night, less than a half mile apart -- to depict the crossroads between the traditions that have given expression to the community in the past and those that might fill that role in the future. Sandy's father, Jimboy, is caught in a cycle of desiring to be on the road to find better work (and freedom from responsibility) and of nostalgia for the culture and familiarity of the South. Jimboy's wanderlust is offensive to Hager, but Sandy idolizes his father, begging him to teach him how to box and fish and play guitar. The scene of Jimboy about to cut out for the road once again -- this time for good -- is one of the most poignant in the book. Sandy discovers his father ""sitting dejectedly on the well-stoop in the sunshine, with his head in his hands,"" his posture conveying the sort of defeat only a man intending to abandon his family feels. The father takes his son in his arms and kisses him awkwardly. He does not say goodbye. Later that afternoon Sandy discovers Jimboy has left town. What prevents Hughes's characters from being mere archetypes of working-class black folks, or of the Great Migration, is their ability to change and respond to one another. ""Not Without Laughter"" is a novel not without forgiveness. Its characters ultimately prize family over their own ideological resolve, though it takes some longer than others to get there. After hearing news of Harriet's arrest for streetwalking, Hager doesn't speak her daughter's name for some time, but she does not disown her; Hager's dying wish is for Harriet to be happy. Even Tempy's taking in of Sandy can be seen as an attempt to pull her family close again after keeping her distance for so long. The one exception is Jimboy, who remains elusive throughout the novel, a father figure always out of reach. A poet who writes fiction can imbue his prose with a considerable amount of magic. For Hughes, his magic is an appreciation for the lyrics and rhythms of jazz and blues. It's one thing to appreciate the cultural aspects of these musical forms, yet another to home in on the lyrics, the power of the repetition employed therein, the subtle turns of phrase and uses of wit.

""Not Without Laughter"" includes lyrics to songs that are mournful, bawdy, vengeful and downright silly. They underscore the importance Hughes felt they played in black life and consciousness. One gets the sense that Sandy's upbringing has been shaped just as much by overhearing these songs as by Aunt Hager's teachings. As the novel progresses, Sandy's thoughts are rendered in musical streams of consciousness, quickly turning from anticipation to curiosity to anger to desire. The result is a realistic portrayal of the rhythms of a young man's inner life: Sandy lies in bed at night and riffs on his own past and future. In perhaps the most peculiar scene of the novel, Sandy is pursued by a solicitous older man, a ""yellow man with a womanish kind of voice,"" on the streets of Chicago. Sandy quickly ascertains that the man is one of the ""queer fellows"" who try to convince boys to come up to their rooms. The scene ends with Sandy running away, but Hughes writes that Sandy wondered what such men did with the boys they seduced. ""Curious, he'd like to find out -- but he was afraid."" For the time period, to acknowledge homosexual activity, and to allow that it might pique one's interest, was quite rare. The scene would remain one of Hughes's more direct engagements with the topic of homosexuality in his prose until the 1961 short story ""Blessed Assurance."" The tragedy and senselessness of racism is felt throughout ""Not Without Laughter,"" and Hughes takes care to show how it manifests itself in ways small and large. Sandy cries after he overhears Annjee's boss, Mrs. Rice, berate his mother as she packs up leftovers for him. When Sandy and his friends are turned away from the Children's Day Party at the theme park, the other kids talk loudly about the injustice of it, and Sandy just keeps muttering, ""I suppose they didn't mean colored kids,"" a feeble attempt to make sense of a surprising and hurtful situation. His friend Buster plans to pass as white and tells the gang that if one day they should run into him in a big city, to act like they don't know him. Colorism seeps down to every aspect of life, even those moments made for pleasure, as at Benbow's dance: ""'High yallers, draw nigh! Brown-skins, come near!' somebody squalled. 'But black gals, stay where you are!'"" Hughes would not write another novel for nearly 30 years, until 1958, but four years after the publication of ""Not Without Laughter"" he released the story collection ""The Ways of White Folks,"" a series of vignettes about the interaction between white and black people, often with grim, moralistic endings. By this time he had parted ways with his white benefactor Charlotte Mason; his resentment over the split might explain why these stories reach for concrete conclusions that do not similarly burden his novel. ""Not Without Laughter"" is a debut in the best of ways: It covers uncharted territory, it compels its readers to see part of the world anew, and it prizes exploration over pat conclusion. Hughes accesses the universal -- how all of us love and dream and laugh and cry -- by staying faithful to the particulars of his characters and their way of life. With this book the young poet from Joplin, Mo., manages to deliver something more valuable than simply an admirable debut -- he gives his readers and contemporaries a guide for careful consideration of the lives of everyday black people. Such a guide is still useful to readers and writers today. Perhaps now more than ever. Poor black lives weren't depicted in the serious fiction of Hughes's day. As Angela Flournoy notes, his debut novel, ""Not Without Laughter,"" changed that.",,"How Langston Hughes Brought His Radical Vision to the Novel For a writer like , who made a name for himself as a poet before the age of 21, his debut novel, ""Not Without Laughter,"" feels like an effort to stake out a bigger claim on his abilities, to create artistic and thematic breathing room. Arna Bontemps, celebrated poet and friend to Hughes, described ""Not Without Laughter"" as the novel that both Hughes and his readers knew he had to write, coming as it did on the heels of Hughes's two well-received poetry collections, ""The Weary Blues"" (1926) and ""Fine Clothes to the Jew"" (1927). Hughes published these collections while a student at Lincoln University, and he released ""Not Without Laughter"" in 1930, shortly after graduating. ""By the date of his first book of prose Hughes had become for many a symbol of the black renaissance,"" Bontemps writes. The stakes were high, then, for the young man born in Joplin, Mo. He had to deliver. ""Not Without Laughter"" crystallizes some of the themes introduced in Hughes's first two poetry collections and examines in detail subjects he would return to throughout his decades-long career, among them the experiences of working-class and poor blacks, the importance of black music to black life, the beauty of black language and the trap of respectability.

Theater,How Much Does a Play Change During Previews? Just Ask 'The Perplexed',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/theater/the-perplexed-previews.html,"How Much Does a Play Change During Previews? Just Ask 'The Perplexed'

The final sound cue for ""The Perplexed,"" Richard Greenberg's new comedy about two estranged, wealthy families brought together by their children's impending nuptials, is offstage laughter. Heralding the arrival of long-awaited guests, it's supposed to be jubilant. Instead, at the first preview of the show last month at New York City Center, the laugh track rang like a witch's cackle. ""It felt too sardonic to me,"" Lynne Meadow, the longtime artistic director of Manhattan Theater Club who's helming the production, said afterward. It took at least seven more tries to finally capture the ideal sound effect. Now it was just a matter of solidifying dozens of other decisions before the play's official premiere on Tuesday.

Previews are a unique, enduring feature of the theater world: Kicking off a show's run, they are a period of public performances before opening night, which can last anywhere from several days to, in the notorious case of 2011's ""Spider Man: Turn Off the Dark,"" 180-some performances. (More recently, previews for ""West Side Story"" were extended by two weeks while Isaac Powell, who plays Tony, recovered from a knee injury.) As such, previews are as much a part of a play's creative process as its closed rehearsals.

While the intimacy of a studio is a safe space for experimentation and development, only once an audience of strangers enters the theater can a director, playwright and actors know for sure what's landing and what's falling flat. Changes to dialogue, costumes, lighting cues come daily until the show is ""frozen,"" when the script and blocking are set. Critics are then invited to previews, and their reviews are traditionally published opening night. The process can result in a whole character sent packing, an intermission axed or pages of script inserted, only to be chucked out days later. Rehearsals can often be called during previews, which means a cast could go over new lines at a morning practice, only to perform an old script that night.

Nothing so extreme was required for ""The Perplexed."" Still, over the course of three weeks and 23 previews, monologues were scrapped, blocking was restaged, 50-cent words were replaced with accessible synonyms and a final bow featuring the actors holding champagne glasses was tried once -- then promptly trashed.

His most recent works, ""Our Mother's Brief Affair"" (2016) and the Tony-nominated ""The Assembled Parties"" (2013), were both directed by Meadow. ""The Perplexed"" is a drawing-room play, literally -- it is set in a lavish home library of an unseen, Jewish billionaire host, Berland Stahl -- and figuratively. Like some characters from Greenberg's previous works, the members of the wedding party here belong to a privileged, insular world, yet feel adrift amid changing cultural tides.

Evy goes way back, both in business and pleasure, with the lawyer Ted Resnik (Gregg Edelman), the father of the groom (JD Taylor). Ted's self-righteous, do-gooder wife is Natalie Hochberg-Resnik (Ilana Levine). Also in the mix are Evy's son, Micah (Zane Pais), a medical student who stars in gay adult films on the side; her writer brother (Patrick Breen); a former rabbi from South Carolina (Eric William Morris) dealing with some meshugas of his own; and one working-class character, Berland's Guyanese aide Patricia Persaud (Anna Itty).

The True Story of Rose Dugdale and the Russborough House Art Heist 

By Anthony M. Amore Rick Perlstein once described the end of the 1960s counterculture as ""a blaze of numbskull adventurism and Maoist masquerade"" that flickered out by 1970. It seems no one told Rose Dugdale, the star of Anthony M. Amore's ""The Woman Who Stole Vermeer,"" who in 1974 elevated numbskull Maoist adventurism to an art form -- literally -- by making off with the Dutch master's painting ""Lady Writing a Letter With Her Maid"" from Russborough House, the Palladian showcase of Sir Alfred and Lady Beit just south of Dublin. Before her political awakening, notoriety and subsequent imprisonment, Dugdale was an upper-class London debutante. Born in March 1941, she was ""tucked safely away"" at her father's country estate during the German air raids, ""a Blitz baby only by date, not by experience."" Her childhood in East Devon was spent, according to friends and family, in ""a farmhouse smartened up to the extent of being 'ludicrously overdone,'"" riding horses, being ""jolly smartly dressed"" and giggling. Rose was devoted to her ""smart, handsome, lean and athletic"" father, Colonel Dugdale. Amore -- the head of security at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum -- relates the likely apocryphal tale of the colonel having his teeth knocked out while playing polo, dismounting, shoving them back into place -- where they ""stayed put for several more years"" -- and carrying on. Rose was educated at Miss Ironside's in South Kensington -- Jane Birkin would be its most famous alumna -- with, in her words, ""the daughters of aristocracy ... learning to curtsy, and worrying not about exams, 'for Mr. Right was bound to come along eventually.'"" Headmistress Virginia Ironside remembered, ""Everyone adored this generous, clever and dashing millionaire's daughter, who was life and laughter."" As Amore notes, ""It was high praise from a woman who taught countless young women gifted with Dugdale-like stock."" After graduation, she did the society lady's grand tour.

She came out in the 1958 season, the last year girls were presented to the queen, owing to the diminishing ""class"" of participants. (Princess Margaret put it less delicately: ""We had to put a stop to it. Every tart in London was getting in."") Rose found the spectacle ""a torture"" but submitted so that her parents would allow her to study politics, philosophy and economics at St. Anne's College, Oxford. ""It was the last time,"" Amore observes, ""she would do anything at her parents' command for the rest of her life."" Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books?

At Oxford, Dugdale was at first ""extremely right-wing,"" defending the House of Lords and the class system and collecting student clubs. Her rebellions were unimaginative -- she wore men's clothes, smoked incessantly and seldom cleaned her room. Rose's own recollection is characteristically disarming: ""I turned into the most disagreeable kind of intellectual, badly dressed and extremely arrogant."" She took an ""unimpressive"" third-class degree and went on to Mount Holyoke in Massachusetts for graduate work in philosophy. The novelist Iris Murdoch, who taught her at Oxford, predicted moderate establishment success for Rose, as perhaps ""an able administrator or a good university teacher."" Rose had different ideas.  An aborted lectureship at Bedford College, two years in the Ministry of Overseas Development and the revolutionary atmosphere of 1968 combined to transform Rose ""from academic to activist."" She railed against the Vietnam War, the iniquities of capitalism and, above all, the English yoke in Ireland. Bloody Sunday -- the massacre of 13 Irish Republican protesters in January 1972 -- drew Rose to domestic terrorism. As Amore illustrates with an irresistible blend of wryness and affection, her adopted proletarian role was not always convincing or particularly noble. Rose continued to attend operas and horse races, supported by an allowance from her father. Her conversation was peppered with ""old left-wing jargon like something out of an old pamphlet from the Fabians."" And her affair with the socialist Wally Heaton was carried out in plain view of his beleaguered wife and daughters. Whether out of ""guilt, restitution or both,"" Rose gave Mrs. Heaton 25,000 British pounds during the relationship.

The road to Russborough was paved with misadventure. Amore's winning detachment is unchanged as Rose evolves from debutante to desperado. She tried to enlist Wally's cousin-in-law, an associate of East London's infamous Kray brothers, to orchestrate criminal activities in aid of the I.R.A., but he balked at the prospect of committing treason and turned police informant. In June 1973, Rose and Wally burglarized her family's estate while they were out at the Epsom Derby, depositing the valuables at the flat of a former tutor. At the open-and-shut trial, she made feeble denials while proclaiming herself ""a freedom fighter""; frequently kissed Wally in the dock; and disparaged her put-upon parents as ""gangsters, thieves and oppressors of the poor."" Wally was sentenced to six years in prison, while Rose's two-year suspended sentence was delivered with sexist condescension and what Amore calls ""a legendary display of poor character evaluation."" The judge was, to be sure, wildly off the mark: ""I think the risk that you will ever again commit burglary or any dishonesty is extremely remote."" Within the year, Dugdale was dropping bombs on the police station at the Irish town of Strabane. In keeping with the element of farce, the explosives failed to detonate, but still she declared the fiasco ""operationally very important and exciting."" A local official enjoyed witnessing his ""enemy making a fool of himself."" Undaunted, Dugdale shifted her sights to Russborough House and its famous -- and poorly guarded -- collection of pictures assembled by the South African diamond magnate Sir Alfred Beit and his brother, Otto. Alfred's nephew (and namesake) and his wife were at home on the night of April 26, 1974. Dugdale, her new boyfriend and two accomplices bound, gagged and insulted the Beits (""capitalist pig"" was the disappointing extent of it) and swiped 19 important paintings by Gainsborough, Goya, Rubens, Velazquez, Vermeer -- to whom fewer than 40 works are fully attributed today -- and others from their frames. The estimated PS8 million haul was recovered upon Rose's capture 10 days later. For her first three days in captivity, Rose refused to confirm her identity or remove her brunette wig. The I.R.A. disavowed the robbery. The ensuing trial concluded with Rose's solemn, semi-coherent peroration and the jury's near-immediate verdict. This time, she got nine years in prison. Amore's publisher has falsely advertised his droll, engaging book as an ""unbelievable"" heist story. ""Ocean's 8"" (or 11, 12, 13) it's not, Dugdale is more Fawlty than Ocean. Yet this in no way diminishes the pleasures of ""The Woman Who Stole Vermeer."" Rose is terrific company: clever, forthright and flamboyant. (During her incarceration, she wed, gave birth and petitioned for the construction of squash facilities.) She is still alive today -- though she did not grant Amore an interview -- and is now praised by the former Irish republicans. Her Facebook profile photo is the Russborough Vermeer. And Rose's legacy? The historian David Farber has suggested that ""the '60s generation of activists saw themselves as acting in history. 'The Whole World Is Watching' -- they were literally chanting it in the streets. And that's the irony that's heated up this debate so much. Because in the end, well, maybe they weren't the historical agents of change quite as much as they hoped."" One imagines Rose's unprintable reply.","In ""The Woman Who Stole Vermeer,"" Anthony M. Amore recounts the social history that led to the biggest female-led art heist ever committed.",3da7eb86-5b9a-5908-bd51-0665cffcc830,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/28/books/review/Carter2/Carter2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=9ccce4cdcffade39526b59543ebc11412959aa00a955d26dd7cb1510b8b27fa3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The novelist Iris Murdoch, who taught Dugdale at Oxford, predicted moderate establishment success for her pupil, as perhaps ""an able administrator or a good university teacher.""

'Freedom Fighter' THE WOMAN WHO STOLE VERMEER 

The True Story of Rose Dugdale and the Russborough House Art Heist 

By Anthony M. Amore Rick Perlstein once described the end of the 1960s counterculture as ""a blaze of numbskull adventurism and Maoist masquerade"" that flickered out by 1970. It seems no one told Rose Dugdale, the star of Anthony M. Amore's ""The Woman Who Stole Vermeer,"" who in 1974 elevated numbskull Maoist adventurism to an art form -- literally -- by making off with the Dutch master's painting ""Lady Writing a Letter With Her Maid"" from Russborough House, the Palladian showcase of Sir Alfred and Lady Beit just south of Dublin. Before her political awakening, notoriety and subsequent imprisonment, Dugdale was an upper-class London debutante. Born in March 1941, she was ""tucked safely away"" at her father's country estate during the German air raids, ""a Blitz baby only by date, not by experience."" Her childhood in East Devon was spent, according to friends and family, in ""a farmhouse smartened up to the extent of being 'ludicrously overdone,'"" riding horses, being ""jolly smartly dressed"" and giggling. Rose was devoted to her ""smart, handsome, lean and athletic"" father, Colonel Dugdale. Amore -- the head of security at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum -- relates the likely apocryphal tale of the colonel having his teeth knocked out while playing polo, dismounting, shoving them back into place -- where they ""stayed put for several more years"" -- and carrying on. Rose was educated at Miss Ironside's in South Kensington -- Jane Birkin would be its most famous alumna -- with, in her words, ""the daughters of aristocracy ... learning to curtsy, and worrying not about exams, 'for Mr. Right was bound to come along eventually.'"" Headmistress Virginia Ironside remembered, ""Everyone adored this generous, clever and dashing millionaire's daughter, who was life and laughter."" As Amore notes, ""It was high praise from a woman who taught countless young women gifted with Dugdale-like stock."" After graduation, she did the society lady's grand tour.

She came out in the 1958 season, the last year girls were presented to the queen, owing to the diminishing ""class"" of participants. (Princess Margaret put it less delicately: ""We had to put a stop to it. Every tart in London was getting in."") Rose found the spectacle ""a torture"" but submitted so that her parents would allow her to study politics, philosophy and economics at St. Anne's College, Oxford. ""It was the last time,"" Amore observes, ""she would do anything at her parents' command for the rest of her life."" Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books?

At Oxford, Dugdale was at first ""extremely right-wing,"" defending the House of Lords and the class system and collecting student clubs. Her rebellions were unimaginative -- she wore men's clothes, smoked incessantly and seldom cleaned her room. Rose's own recollection is characteristically disarming: ""I turned into the most disagreeable kind of intellectual, badly dressed and extremely arrogant."" She took an ""unimpressive"" third-class degree and went on to Mount Holyoke in Massachusetts for graduate work in philosophy. The novelist Iris Murdoch, who taught her at Oxford, predicted moderate establishment success for Rose, as perhaps ""an able administrator or a good university teacher."" Rose had different ideas.  An aborted lectureship at Bedford College, two years in the Ministry of Overseas Development and the revolutionary atmosphere of 1968 combined to transform Rose ""from academic to activist."" She railed against the Vietnam War, the iniquities of capitalism and, above all, the English yoke in Ireland. Bloody Sunday -- the massacre of 13 Irish Republican protesters in January 1972 -- drew Rose to domestic terrorism. As Amore illustrates with an irresistible blend of wryness and affection, her adopted proletarian role was not always convincing or particularly noble. Rose continued to attend operas and horse races, supported by an allowance from her father. Her conversation was peppered with ""old left-wing jargon like something out of an old pamphlet from the Fabians."" And her affair with the socialist Wally Heaton was carried out in plain view of his beleaguered wife and daughters. Whether out of ""guilt, restitution or both,"" Rose gave Mrs. Heaton 25,000 British pounds during the relationship.

He was 76. The cause was brain damage sustained after a fall, his wife, Jessica Weber, said. He had Parkinson's disease. A protege and partner of the influential graphic designer Herb Lubalin, whose acolytes also included the art director George Lois and the photographer Art Kane, Mr. Peckolick was a virtuoso man of letters. His typography distinguished familiar logos, like GM's (just the two initials underscored by a muscular solid bar), and the typefaces for company names, including Pfizer, Revlon and Mercedes-Benz, and institutions like New York University and the City College of New York.

""Basically, for me, if a word was a beautiful word, it wasn't the sound of the word that intrigued me but the look of the word,"" Mr. Peckolick (pronounced PECK-oh-lick) told The Huffington Post in 2015. ""I saw each letterform as a piece of design. Cat is not 'cat' -- it's c-a-t. That's what led to the beginning of the expressive topography."" Seymour Chwast, a fellow designer and illustrator, said in an email that Mr. Peckolick ""was totally dedicated to design, its history, its function and what it might offer in the future.""  Eventually fed up with being a rainmaker for the advertising agencies he worked for, diverting his creative his energies to courting clients, Mr. Peckolick took up painting. As an artist, he was captivated by weathered billboards and their faded evocations of a vanishing cityscape.

""Signage has been covered so often by photography that as a subject it is a commonplace,"" Grace Glueck of The New York Times wrote in reviewing an exhibition of his work at a SoHo gallery in 2002, ""but Mr. Peckolick, good at the colors and textures of erosion, nicely captures the sense of time past that gives these brief messages their nostalgic appeal."" Alan Jay Peckolick was born on Oct. 3, 1940, in the Bronx to Charles Peckolick, a letter carrier (actual letters, not the kind his son would work with) and the former Belle Binenbaum. ""I never knew anything about design or graphics or any of those fancy words,"" Mr. Peckolick recalled in 2015. ""But I used to draw. I used to draw everything. When my mother used to send me out to get groceries, by the time I was back there were little drawings on the grocery bags."" He graduated from Elmont Memorial High School on Long Island, just across the Queens border, after which, he said: ""My mother put together a portfolio which was made of anything I drew on -- handkerchiefs, scraps, whatever -- and put it literally into a brown paper bag. She sent me out into the world to go to places like Cooper Union and the School of Visual Arts. Both schools, he said, ""immediately saw there was no talent here, and they rejected me."" Pratt Institute in Brooklyn accepted him, in the illustration department. But three months later, he was told to leave because his work was not improving. A schoolmate discovered him in a coffee shop, dejected.

""I explained to him,"" he recalled, ""that I was kicked out of art school because I couldn't draw very well. He said: 'Well that's no problem. Why don't you just become a graphic designer?' I said, 'What's that?' He said, 'Don't worry about what it is, but you don't have to know how to draw!'"" Mr. Peckolick graduated from Pratt in 1964 and opened his own office. In 1972 he joined Lubalin, Smith & Carnase (the firm later became Pushpin Lubalin Peckolick Associates).

Television,2 Men Detained in Jussie Smollett Case Are Released by Police,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/15/arts/television/smollett-suspects.html,"The two brothers arrested in connection with the reported attack on the ""Empire"" star Jussie Smollett were released without being charged on Friday, a police spokesman said. They are no longer considered potential suspects. ""Due to new evidence as a result of today's interrogations, the individuals questioned by police in the 'Empire' case have now been released without charging and detectives have additional investigative work to complete,"" Anthony Guglielmi, the Chicago Police Department spokesman, said in a statement.

After ""meticulous investigation with the use of advanced technology, interviews with the victim and witnesses, and transportation records,"" the police said, they discerned the two men's identities and detained them.

Gloria Schmidt, a lawyer for the two men arrested, did not respond to calls and emails requesting comment, but did tell CBS Chicago: ""They're really baffled why they are people of interest.

Opinion,There's a Strong Case for Sticking With Bail Reform,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/opinion/sunday/bail-reform-new-york.html,"Ms. Bazelon is a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine. Ms. Rahman is the director of strategy and new initiatives at the Vera Institute of Justice.



Since bail reform began in New York on Jan. 1, opponents have been hard at work to create a backlash against the new law, sometimes wrongly blaming it for the commission of crimes by people they say should have been jailed for earlier offenses, and warning of broad danger to the public. Using this old script, prosecutors and police chiefs are demanding rollbacks as a public opinion survey shows that support for bail reform is falling. Largely untold are the stories of thousands of New Yorkers who have been released without incident, and allowed to return to their families, jobs and communities while charges against them are pending. The law is unusual, compared with those in some other states, and that's one reason it's politically vulnerable. But it has the potential to end mass incarceration as we know it in New York, with an anticipated drop in the jail population statewide of 40 percent. It deserves a chance to prove itself. Before the new law, 21,000 New Yorkers were in jail on any given night around the state. More than 60 percent were being held before trial, primarily because they couldn't afford to pay bail. The new law has already reduced the number to 15,000 by making release before trial automatic for people accused of most misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies, which make up 90 percent of the roughly 400,000 arrests each year. Judges still have the authority in all cases to impose conditions like oversight by a case manager, referrals to treatment or counseling, and in some cases, electronic monitoring. For example, take the case of Tiffany Harris, who was arrested and charged with slapping three Orthodox Jewish women on the street in Brooklyn, released without bail, and then rearrested for hitting someone else. A judge could have ordered mental health counseling after the first incident that might have helped her instead of just letting her go.

Judges can also still set bail on almost all violent felony offenses, any case involving sexual abuse or misconduct, all felony and some misdemeanor domestic violence offenses, and witness intimidation and tampering cases. The most common charges for which release must now be allowed are drug possession, theft and unlicensed driving. The best evidence for the success of bail reform comes from Brooklyn. Prosecutors there stopped demanding bail for almost all misdemeanors in April 2017. Over the next year, the number of people held on bail in Brooklyn declined by 43 percent, and Brooklyn has also experienced a decline in crime, with fewer shootings and the lowest number of murders in the borough's history in 2019, according to the district attorney's office.

In 2019, the Bronx and Manhattan followed Brooklyn's lead with similar results. The real impact of bail reform is being felt in upstate New York, where 60 percent of the people in jail are charged with misdemeanors. Already, there have been major drops in the number of people in jail in counties like Herkimer and Onondaga, with no upticks in crime. Despite those facts, bail reform is in political trouble mainly because the state is the only one in the country that bars a judge who is deciding if bail is warranted from considering whether a person poses a threat to public safety. For decades, New York judges have been allowed to consider only the likelihood that the defendant will appear for future court dates (though it is likely that at least some judges factor in public safety in their calculus).

When bail reform was debated last year, the New York State Legislature considered adding a public-safety provision for a small subset of serious cases. But many proponents of reform, especially defense lawyers, feared such a provision would give judges too much leeway to impose preventive detention. The Legislature and Gov. Andrew Cuomo instead struck a compromise that left money bail as an option for almost all violent crimes, the same small subset of serious cases for which a public-safety provision was considered and rejected. Now the governor is mostly defending bail reform, but he also called it an ""ongoing process"" in his budget address Tuesday. If New York decides to tweak its law, it should do so based on months, not weeks, of data. Any amendments should safeguard the principle that the state cannot have two systems of justice, one for the rich and one for the poor. If the Legislature decides to allow judges to detain people for the sake of public safety, it should also eliminate money bail entirely, so that wealthy people aren't released while others facing the same charges are jailed. And a public-safety provision should apply only to serious offenses, and require a hearing with facts showing that the person is likely to threaten someone else's physical safety. The results of bail reform in New Jersey show the benefits of staying the course. In 2017, New Jersey courts essentially stopped imposing cash bail for all criminal charges. Early on, opponents said things like, ""Nobody's afraid to commit crimes anymore,"" and one mother sued the state after her son was killed, allegedly by a man who had been released on a gun possession charge. The New Jersey Supreme Court made it easier to detain people accused of gun crimes or repeat offenses, but otherwise, the state weathered the criticism. In 2017, according to state data, less than 3 percent of people released before trial were rearrested for a serious violent felony or for gun possession. On any given day in 2018, 6,000 fewer people were in jail than had been six years earlier. At the same time, violent crime in New Jersey continued to fall. The experience of other states also shows the value of another element of New York's new law: reducing the time that prosecutors have to turn over evidence in their possession to the defense. New York's so-called blindfold law had allowed prosecutors to withhold key evidence until the morning of trial, and had contributed to wrongful convictions, according to the state bar association. North Carolina and Texas enacted laws in the last decade requiring broad disclosure of evidence, known as discovery. At first, prosecutors said the requirements were unworkable and put witnesses and victims at risk by potentially disclosing their identities. But judges in those states -- and in New York -- can limit disclosure when necessary. Over time, the laws in North Carolina and Texas proved their worth. A 2016 study of North Carolina's law found that 91 percent of prosecutors reported the law was working well. Texas prosecutors have urged New York to view their state as a model for discovery practices. Studies show that it takes only two or three days behind bars to increase the risk that someone charged with a minor, nonviolent crime will be arrested again. It may seem counterintuitive, but jailing people leads to less, not more, public safety. Jail destabilizes people who may already be struggling to pay the rent or get to work. Fear-mongering makes for spicy headlines but terrible policy. New Yorkers should not give in to it.

Style,Does This Red Cap Make Me Look MAGA?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/20/style/red-baseball-hats-maga.html,"Justin Peterson , a 37-year-old graphic designer who lives in Orlando, Fla., owns nearly 100 baseball caps, including several featuring the familiar ""C"" logo of the Cincinnati Reds. But when he and his wife visited her family in Cincinnati over the recent Independence Day holiday weekend, Mr. Peterson didn't bring his red Reds cap. Instead, he opted for the team's alternate black hat. ""Unfortunately, I don't feel comfortable wearing red baseball hats anymore,"" Mr. Peterson said. ""I don't want someone assuming I'm something that I'm not, or that I represent something that I think has become pretty ugly."" There are plenty of people who are proud to wear President Trump's signature ""Make America Great Again"" caps, of course, as evinced at recent rallies. When Mr. Trump's campaign introduced them in 2015, he was dubbed a ""marketing genius."" Hats flew off the shelves in the store at the Trump Tower in Midtown as Republican supporters and Democrats alike vied to obtain the accessory of the summer.

Put more simply, they fear being mistaken for MAGA. Since teams throughout the sports world produce baseball-style caps for sale, the potential for MAGA confusion extends beyond baseball teams like the Philadelphia Phillies and St. Louis Cardinals, and includes fans of the Kansas City Chiefs (a football team), the New Jersey Devils (hockey), Liverpool F.C. (soccer) and many other red-themed teams. It appears to be the latest example of how Mr. Trump's presence tends to have a polarizing effect on almost anything it touches, even something as seemingly innocuous as the humble ball cap. Promotional caps have also been affected. People responding to a reporter's inquiry said they had stopped wearing red caps advertising things like Maker's Mark bourbon and Sriracha hot sauce.

On a recent episode of the humorist John Hodgman's podcast, ""Judge John Hodgman,"" a woman asked if her husband should stop wearing his red promotional caps from a software company. Mr. Hodgman's response: ""If you're not a Trump voter, stay away from it. Stay away from anything that might resemble a MAGA hat.""

Louis Orangeo, 27, a procurement analyst in Bloomfield N.J., did vote for Trump in 2016 and is prepared to vote for him again in 2020, although he isn't 100 percent sure. Mr. Orangeo said he bought a MAGA hat after the election, ""mainly to troll people,"" but stopped wearing it because of negative responses. ""I hate having to explain it and defend it,"" he said. ""It always gets a look and a sneer."" He does wear a minor league baseball team's red cap plenty and nobody has ever said anything. But Mr. Peterson, the Orlando graphic designer, decided to mothball his red caps after his wife pointed out the potential for confusion or confrontation. And others have made similar decisions after noticing the responses to their red hats. ""One of my favorite hats is a red University of Wisconsin Badgers hat,"" said Corey Looby, 31, a database manager from Madison, Wis. ""But when I traveled, I would regularly notice glares from people I passed on the street. I don't want to be associated with MAGA, even mistakenly, so I stopped wearing it."" The phenomenon is by no means universal; some red-capped fans said the potential MAGA connection had never occurred to them until a reporter brought it up. ""I don't like engaging in political conversations. I just want to be friends and talk about other topics, not politics,"" said Jason Stygar, 34, an audio engineer in St. Louis. ""But as a lifelong Cardinals fan, I love my red hat -- I'll wear it anywhere and everywhere. It had never even occurred to me, that someone would mistake it for a MAGA hat, and nobody's ever bothered me about it."" And some are wearing red caps in defiance, regardless of politics. ""I am not pro-Trump or anti-Trump, but I do have a Detroit Red Wings hat and get weird looks when I wear it,"" said Nick Landry, 28, project manager for a carpenter subcontractor in Milford, Mich. ""I continue to wear it as a social experiment, hoping people will feel like idiots when they realize that it's not a MAGA hat and that they're feeling vitriol over something so stupid."" Fans and teams alike, though, have long been wary about inadvertent political messaging. In 1954, for example, the Cincinnati Reds changed their official team name to Redlegs, to avoid being associated with the communist scare. (They changed the name back to Reds in 1959.)

And during George W. Bush's presidency, left-leaning Washington Nationals fans often wore caps with the team's secondary ""DC"" logo, rather than the primary ""W"" mark, lest they be viewed as Dubya supporters. But those examples were team specific and localized, while the potential for being mistaken for MAGA appears to have no regional or even international boundaries. That's what Daniel Proulx discovered earlier this year when he wore a red Molson beer cap while pitching in his softball league in the Canadian town of Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. ""The other teams would comment and ask if I was a Trump supporter,"" said Mr. Proulx, 34, an athletic director at a junior high school. ""I had no idea what they meant, but it was a consistent question. After a while, my own teammates started suggesting that I get a different hat. Maybe something blue instead of red."" Whatever one's opinion of Mr. Trump, these stories are a testament to the MAGA hat's success, both as a popular piece of apparel and as a cultural signifier. Because there are plenty of knockoffs, it's hard to calculate how many of the hats have been sold or distributed since they debuted in 2015 (the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment), but they have become sufficiently ubiquitous, at least in some circles, to overshadow all other red ball caps. Aside from wanting to avoid controversy or the potential for mistaken tribal identity, some people who say they have taken their red headgear out of circulation see this choice as a matter of courtesy or even empathy toward immigrants, minorities and other groups that they consider targets of the president's policies.

""It breaks my heart to think I can make someone be on guard and uncomfortable just by wearing a red hat,"" said Jeremiah McBrayer, 42, an information-technology worker from Missouri who shelved his red headwear after seeing some negative responses to it at his local Home Depot. ""It is just sad and unfortunate that this is where we are in our country now."" Has all of this led to a decline in non-MAGA red cap sales? Two leading cap brands -- New Era Cap Company and '47 -- did not respond to requests for comment; neither did Lids, a chain of cap retailers. Another retailer, Dick's Sporting Goods Inc., declined to comment, citing a company policy of not discussing sales figures. But managers at several sportswear shops said red caps have been harder to obtain from distributors lately, and some of them said the scarlet scarcity was directly related to the MAGA connection. ""Three of our vendors specifically mentioned this trend,"" said Benji Boyter, who runs the retail operation at a South Carolina golf and tennis resort. ""One of them mentioned it in the sense of staying away from too many red hats, while the other two casually mentioned something along the lines of 'You've got to be careful with red hats these days.'"" Many of the people eschewing their red caps said they feel conflicted. On the one hand, they are engaged in a form of protest and resistance. But in doing so, they're granting Mr. Trump power over their apparel choices and how they express their support for their favorite teams. ""It's like, he can't take red hats from us, too,"" said Lendsey Thomson , 33, a sports lawyer in Kansas City who has stopped wearing his favorite red ""KC"" cap. ""But, alas, he kind of has.""

At least one fan has decided to reclaim that power. Dave Tarr, a 64-year-old retiree and Arsenal soccer fan in Charleston, S.C., put aside his beloved red Arsenal cap during the 2016 election campaign. ""And then a few months ago,"" he said, ""I just decided that I wouldn't give Trump or his minions the satisfaction of not doing something that I wanted to do."" So Mr. Tarr brought his Arsenal cap out of retirement and began wearing it again. So far, he said, nobody has said anything about it.",Some sports fans don't want to be confused for Trump supporters.,b57b52be-ad49-589b-afa9-89c09d7a4cc6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/21/fashion/00MAGA1/00MAGA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=2fce0cef19f2fd982d4faf492a7f13404de2eb367772148e7018299f0f6e6d7a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Justin Peterson owns almost 100 baseball caps.

Art & Design,"An Artist Unites North and South Korea, Stitch by Stitch",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/arts/design/kyungah-ham-north-korea.html,"SEOUL, South Korea -- Growing up here in the 1970s, Kyungah Ham would occasionally find propaganda leaflets sent from North Korea via helium balloons. Like her classmates, Ms. Ham turned in the leaflets at school, where she was given a reward for doing a small part in South Korea's simmering ideological war with its neighbor. In 2008, when Ms. Ham found another North Korean leaflet -- this one under the gate of her parents' home -- it felt like an alien object, blown in from a different planet. By then, she was a multimedia artist who had come to distrust much of the history she'd been taught, and she knew that South Koreans were sending leaflets of their own over the border. That got her wondering: Could she communicate directly with people who, through a geopolitical tragedy now 65 years old, she is forbidden to contact? It was the birth of what might be the art world's most extraordinary, ongoing collaboration. For a decade, Ms. Ham has been producing designs on her computer that are printed and smuggled into North Korea through intermediaries based in Russia or China. Then a group of anonymous artisans, whom she has never met or spoken to, are paid to convert them into embroideries, using exquisitely fine stitching. With bribes and subterfuge, the works are smuggled back out. Ultimately, they are shown and sold at galleries and exhibitions. The most ambitious pieces are large-scale renderings of luminous, glittering chandeliers, some nearly 12 feet wide and 9 feet high, that from a distance look like photographs set against black backdrops. Get closer, and a filigree of stitches appear. Both chandelier and backdrop have been painstakingly composed of silk thread.

A lot of artists talk about taking risks, but few mean it as literally as Ms. Ham. International sanctions prohibit commerce with the Hermit Kingdom, so at least theoretically, she could face criminal prosecution for these cash-for-work transactions. The potential penalties for her collaborators are far graver. If caught, these residents of the world's most repressive regime could be imprisoned or executed. The dangers facing the North Koreans raise ethical issues that, intended or otherwise, become part of Ms. Ham's art. ""With Kyungah's work, it's difficult to separate the object from the process of making the object,"" said Rosalie Kim, a curator at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, which acquired one of Ms. Ham's embroideries in 2016. ""The risk isn't the point, but the risk emphasizes the consequences of the separation of the peninsula and what is at stake in trying to overcome it.""

Ms. Ham protects the covert network in her employ with a spymaster's care, and would not discuss the size of the lump sums that cover the cost of intermediaries, artisans and bribes. But she hides neither her art nor the basics of her methods. The Embroidery Project, as she calls it, has been part of museum group shows in London, Vienna and Singapore, and wall labels beside each piece succinctly explain how it was made. On first meeting, Ms. Ham seems wildly miscast for the role she has created for herself. She would be the first to admit that she is lousy at coping with stress, now a permanent feature of her life. Once, on a flight to meet an intermediary, she collapsed with a stomach ailment so painful and severe that as soon as she landed, she was put on the next plane back to Seoul and admitted to a hospital.

If her nerves are fragile, other parts are made of steel. During interviews in both Paris and Seoul in recent months, she was adamant and particular about nearly everything. Before dinner at a brasserie, she rejected three different tables offered by a host. (Her final choice, it must be said, was superior to the others.) She issued demands about virtually every aspect of this article, including who would photograph her. And though an introvert by nature, once she overcomes her natural shyness, she is bursting with words.

""If we take it step by step,"" she said with a smile early in our first meeting, preparing to describe her life and work, ""this will take five hours."" As Ms. Ham explained, her chandeliers are a symbol of the foreign powers that divided Korea along the 38th Parallel after three years of fighting the Korean War. (The golden age of those powers passed, she said, which is why these chandeliers are either falling or already on the ground.) The border was largely imposed on the peninsula by non-Koreans; Ms. Ham's favorite word to describe this fact is ""absurd."" As she conceived her embroideries, she was inspired in part by a moment in a documentary about the Mass Games, Pyongyang's socialist-realist extravaganza of tightly choreographed music, dance and gymnastics. The production includes a crowd, thousands of people strong, holding flip books in front their faces with blocks of colors on each page. The pages are turned in uncannily timed unison, a vast human billboard of seamlessly changing words and images. Ms. Ham watched and saw the face of a young boy peeking over his color book. ""He was like a pixel in a digital image,"" she said. ""I wanted to bring this idea to my chandeliers. Behind them are highly skilled embroidery workers, whom you can't see, but they memorialize themselves, stitch by stitch.""

Ms. Ham is not idle while she waits, and the embroideries are just one facet of a varied career. Since earning an M.F.A. from the School of Visual Arts in New York, in 1995, she has been making videos, sculptures, photographs and an assortment of installations. One recurring impulse is to highlight the ways power is abused, and for whatever reason, she is drawn to methods that give her agita. With an installation called ""Museum Display,"" in 2010, theme and practice were combined. She has long been irked by the many Western museums filled with cultural treasures from other countries -- think of the Elgin marbles, originally part of the Parthenon in Greece, which have spent the last 200 years in the British Museum. With wit and irony, Ms. Ham pilloried this tradition by stealing hundreds of mundane objects from museums around the world, including forks, saucers, knives, vases, salt and pepper shakers. She then displayed them in a huge glass case, under lights, labeling each item with the gravity befitting a looted masterpiece. ""Sign, 'These doors are alarmed,' 10cm x 10 cm, the British Museum, 2009,"" reads one. Her other great passion is connecting to strangers, and the Embroidery Project is an expression of that urge. Among the first images she conceived for her artisans were stylized words, rendered in both Korean and English, and set against abstract and colorful designs. One simply read ""I'm sorry,"" in the two languages. ""I wanted to tell these artisans, 'I'm sorry about the situation,'"" she said. ""'I am sorry about what history has done to us.'"" Later, she began what she calls the ""SMS Series in Camouflage,"" in which she weaves faint words, in script, into almost psychedelic oil slicks of color. One of these not-so-secret messages reads ""Big Smile,"" an instruction for performers during the Mass Games.

Opinion,"To Reduce Racial Inequality, Raise the Minimum Wage",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/25/opinion/minimum-wage-race-protests.html,"After a summer of protests over the killing of George Floyd broadened into a wider reckoning on racial injustice, corporate America and the political establishment unleashed a flurry of promises to combat systemic racism. Diversity initiatives have been launched; high-profile companies in several sectors have settled on the advancement of a few people of color in their hierarchies. It's clear that these actions, while positive steps, so far mostly concern an elite stratum. They are no substitute for dismantling structural racism in the economy. Recent American history, however, provides an apt lesson about which public policies are effective at reducing deep-rooted inequalities. Our new research shows that Congress's decision in 1966 to both raise the minimum wage and expand it to workers in previously unprotected industries led to a significant drop in earnings inequality between Black and white Americans -- and explains more than 20 percent of the overall reduction in succeeding years. The findings suggest that raising and expanding the minimum wage could once again reduce the persistent earnings divide between white workers and Black, Hispanic and Native American workers. Though legislation to raise the wage floor would be a universal program in name and application, in practice it would be a remarkably effective tool for racial justice.

[Read more on 27 places that raised their minumum wage to $15 an hour.] As with other major pieces of 20th-century progressive legislation, the cost of gaining Southern Democratic votes in 1938 for the federal minimum wage was a racist compromise: in this case, the exclusion of certain industries because of their high concentrations of Black workers, especially in the South. Though it's a fact that is often skipped over in popular histories, civil rights leaders who organized the famous March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963 demanded an increase in the minimum wage and one that applied to all employment. Modest but meaningful increases were eventually passed, and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1966 also extended coverage to some of the excluded industries: nursing homes, laundries, hotels, restaurants, schools, hospitals and agriculture. In 1967, the newly covered sectors employed about eight million workers ages 25 to 55, or about 21 percent of the U.S. prime-age work force. And, crucially, nearly one-third of Black workers were employed in these sectors. White workers greatly benefited from the 1966 law; Black workers gained even more. In addition to being overrepresented in the newly covered industries, Black workers earned less on average in these industries than their white counterparts. So the earnings increase caused by the reform was 10 percent on average for Black workers in the newly covered industries, twice as much as that for white workers. Based on our analysis, we estimate that the minimum wage increase was responsible for approximately 20 percent of the reduction in the earnings gap between Black and white workers between 1967 and 1980.

Economists who study gains in racial equality during that era have mostly credited improved educational outcomes for Black students (in terms of both number of years of school and quality of education) and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned explicit job discrimination. But it's clear now that the 1966 minimum wage reform also made a significant contribution. When the March on Washington took place in 1963, Black workers in the United States earned on average 59 cents for every dollar earned by the average white worker. Today, Black workers in the United States earn on average 78 cents for every dollar earned by average white workers -- a notable improvement. But this ratio has remained essentially unchanged since about 1980. In one respect, this stagnation is a gloomy affirmation of Black families' continued frustration with an economy stacked against them, four decades on. Yet it also indicates that raising and expanding the minimum wage today could be central to making progress again. The coronavirus pandemic has exposed the economic perils still faced by Black, Hispanic and Native American workers as a result of their disproportionate employment in low-wage sectors of the labor market -- jobs that while deemed invaluable ""essential work"" during this crisis often don't pay a living wage. Making the minimum wage a living wage would match politicians' rhetoric with actual public policy and would go a long way in making the lives of people of color materially better. Opponents of minimum wage increases assert that they, for one thing, reduce the number of jobs available to low-income workers. However, numerous studies of minimum wage increases across historical contexts and countries indicate that even when the minimum wage is large with respect to prior median earnings, negative effects on employment tend to be limited. Our research suggests the next Congress could raise the federal minimum wage substantially, reducing racial inequality without doing harm to the broader market. Congress, as well as governors and state legislatures, could also expand the minimum wage to cover the millions of workers whose sectors continue to be excluded from it. Establishing federal, state or local minimum wage thresholds for independent contractors, for example, would lift the often paltry take-home pay workers receive in the gig economy, where Black workers and other workers of color are overrepresented. California is in the midst of such a fight -- and facing opposition from many powerful tech giants.

Ending what's known as the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers is another opportunity to level the playing field. Despite some improved state laws, employers of tipped workers are required by federal law to pay a mere $2.13 an hour. Not only is this exemption a direct legacy of efforts to economically hobble freed people after slavery; it also continues to have an outsize effect on female Black and Hispanic workers. Tipped workers overall are twice as likely to live in poverty as the general work force. And tipped workers of color in the restaurant industry are twice as likely to live in poverty as their white counterparts. It is no coincidence that civil rights leaders in 1963 singled out the minimum wage as a critical tool for racial justice, and their demands are just as salient today. The federal minimum wage has not been raised since it went to $7.25 an hour in 2009. And inflation has reduced its value by nearly one-third from its highest real value, in 1968. If America's contemporary leaders are serious about reducing racial inequality, they must push for simple, bold measures, such as doubling the federal minimum wage. Otherwise, the country may miss an opportunity, after the largest protests for racial equality in U.S. history, to improve the lives of millions of people of color.",Diversity and inclusion programs for elites are tokens. A large wage increase that would most benefit the Black working class is far better.,2cecbf6f-13c8-57da-8401-6a7a4870ffbe,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/26/opinion/26derenoncourt-montialoux-01/26derenoncourt-montialoux-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=bad395e20b5c8de5dd36a5b4580a7609adb2389a036ebf0f5cf2301caf53c040&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,,2cecbf6f-13c8-57da-8401-6a7a4870ffbe,Demo_data/D1_img2/12cecbf6f-13c8-57da-8401-6a7a4870ffbe.jpg,11,"To Reduce Racial Inequality, Raise the Minimum Wage After a summer of protests over the killing of George Floyd broadened into a wider reckoning on racial injustice, corporate America and the political establishment unleashed a flurry of promises to combat systemic racism.

If America's contemporary leaders are serious about reducing racial inequality, they must push for simple, bold measures, such as doubling the federal minimum wage. Otherwise, the country may miss an opportunity, after the largest protests for racial equality in U.S. history, to improve the lives of millions of people of color. Diversity and inclusion programs for elites are tokens. A large wage increase that would most benefit the Black working class is far better.",,"To Reduce Racial Inequality, Raise the Minimum Wage After a summer of protests over the killing of George Floyd broadened into a wider reckoning on racial injustice, corporate America and the political establishment unleashed a flurry of promises to combat systemic racism. Diversity initiatives have been launched; high-profile companies in several sectors have settled on the advancement of a few people of color in their hierarchies. It's clear that these actions, while positive steps, so far mostly concern an elite stratum. They are no substitute for dismantling structural racism in the economy. Recent American history, however, provides an apt lesson about which public policies are effective at reducing deep-rooted inequalities. Our new research shows that Congress's decision in 1966 to both raise the minimum wage and expand it to workers in previously unprotected industries led to a significant drop in earnings inequality between Black and white Americans -- and explains more than 20 percent of the overall reduction in succeeding years. The findings suggest that raising and expanding the minimum wage could once again reduce the persistent earnings divide between white workers and Black, Hispanic and Native American workers. Though legislation to raise the wage floor would be a universal program in name and application, in practice it would be a remarkably effective tool for racial justice.

[Read more on 27 places that raised their minumum wage to $15 an hour.] As with other major pieces of 20th-century progressive legislation, the cost of gaining Southern Democratic votes in 1938 for the federal minimum wage was a racist compromise: in this case, the exclusion of certain industries because of their high concentrations of Black workers, especially in the South. Though it's a fact that is often skipped over in popular histories, civil rights leaders who organized the famous March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963 demanded an increase in the minimum wage and one that applied to all employment. Modest but meaningful increases were eventually passed, and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1966 also extended coverage to some of the excluded industries: nursing homes, laundries, hotels, restaurants, schools, hospitals and agriculture. In 1967, the newly covered sectors employed about eight million workers ages 25 to 55, or about 21 percent of the U.S. prime-age work force. And, crucially, nearly one-third of Black workers were employed in these sectors. White workers greatly benefited from the 1966 law; Black workers gained even more. In addition to being overrepresented in the newly covered industries, Black workers earned less on average in these industries than their white counterparts. So the earnings increase caused by the reform was 10 percent on average for Black workers in the newly covered industries, twice as much as that for white workers. Based on our analysis, we estimate that the minimum wage increase was responsible for approximately 20 percent of the reduction in the earnings gap between Black and white workers between 1967 and 1980.

Economists who study gains in racial equality during that era have mostly credited improved educational outcomes for Black students (in terms of both number of years of school and quality of education) and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned explicit job discrimination. But it's clear now that the 1966 minimum wage reform also made a significant contribution. When the March on Washington took place in 1963, Black workers in the United States earned on average 59 cents for every dollar earned by the average white worker. Today, Black workers in the United States earn on average 78 cents for every dollar earned by average white workers -- a notable improvement. But this ratio has remained essentially unchanged since about 1980. In one respect, this stagnation is a gloomy affirmation of Black families' continued frustration with an economy stacked against them, four decades on. Yet it also indicates that raising and expanding the minimum wage today could be central to making progress again. The coronavirus pandemic has exposed the economic perils still faced by Black, Hispanic and Native American workers as a result of their disproportionate employment in low-wage sectors of the labor market -- jobs that while deemed invaluable ""essential work"" during this crisis often don't pay a living wage. Making the minimum wage a living wage would match politicians' rhetoric with actual public policy and would go a long way in making the lives of people of color materially better. Opponents of minimum wage increases assert that they, for one thing, reduce the number of jobs available to low-income workers. However, numerous studies of minimum wage increases across historical contexts and countries indicate that even when the minimum wage is large with respect to prior median earnings, negative effects on employment tend to be limited. Our research suggests the next Congress could raise the federal minimum wage substantially, reducing racial inequality without doing harm to the broader market. Congress, as well as governors and state legislatures, could also expand the minimum wage to cover the millions of workers whose sectors continue to be excluded from it. Establishing federal, state or local minimum wage thresholds for independent contractors, for example, would lift the often paltry take-home pay workers receive in the gig economy, where Black workers and other workers of color are overrepresented. California is in the midst of such a fight -- and facing opposition from many powerful tech giants.

Ending what's known as the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers is another opportunity to level the playing field. Despite some improved state laws, employers of tipped workers are required by federal law to pay a mere $2.13 an hour. Not only is this exemption a direct legacy of efforts to economically hobble freed people after slavery; it also continues to have an outsize effect on female Black and Hispanic workers. Tipped workers overall are twice as likely to live in poverty as the general work force. And tipped workers of color in the restaurant industry are twice as likely to live in poverty as their white counterparts. It is no coincidence that civil rights leaders in 1963 singled out the minimum wage as a critical tool for racial justice, and their demands are just as salient today. The federal minimum wage has not been raised since it went to $7.25 an hour in 2009. And inflation has reduced its value by nearly one-third from its highest real value, in 1968. If America's contemporary leaders are serious about reducing racial inequality, they must push for simple, bold measures, such as doubling the federal minimum wage.

Theater,"Review: Without Ethel Merman, a Limp 'Call Me Madam' at Encores!",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/theater/call-me-madam-review.html,"""Neither the character of Mrs. Sally Adams, nor Miss Ethel Merman, resembles any other person alive or dead."" So theatergoers who saw ""Call Me Madam"" when it opened on Broadway in 1950 were warned in the Playbill. With the first half of that warning, the show's producers might have been angling to forestall legal action from Perle Mesta, the Washington ""hostess"" whom President Truman appointed ambassador to Luxembourg in 1949. In ""Call Me Madam,"" Sally Adams, introduced in song as ""The Hostess With the Mostes' on the Ball,"" is named ambassador to a country called Lichtenburg -- and proceeds to make a mess of it. The other half of the alert, though, was simply a statement of fact. Merman's clarion voice, brusque style and ha-cha-cha exuberance made her musical theater's indispensable star for decades. But it also made most of the vehicles tailored to her gifts difficult fits for anyone else.

That at any rate is the impression left by the pulse-lowering Encores! production of ""Call Me Madam"" that opened on Wednesday at City Center, directed by Casey Hushion and starring Carmen Cusack in the Merman role. Ms. Cusack, a strong performer in other circumstances -- she emerged gleaming from the wreckage of ""Bright Star"" in 2016 -- is overpowered here by material that, if it can work at all today, can do so only when rough-handled by a mauler.

That seems to have been the happier case when Encores! first revived the show in 1995, with Tyne Daly as the ambassador. I didn't see it then, but the recording of the Irving Berlin score from that production delivers the thrill of a performance that knocks down everything in its path. And the flimsy story, not just the role of Sally Adams, requires that. When Adams, who liberally buys Washington influence with her oil millions, gets the D-list patronage job in Lichtenburg, where ""babies and cheese are our main industries,"" she thinks that because it is a duchy its citizens must be Dutch. (The musical's book is by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse.) Despite the ministrations of her eager young assistant, Kenneth Gibson (Jason Gotay), and of the embassy's imperious charge d'affaires, Pemberton Maxwell (Michael Benjamin Washington), she makes gauche mistakes in both protocol and policy. The authors' intention is clearly to satirize the underinformed internationalism of postwar America: Adams's faith in capital and capitalism leads her to attempt to solve cash-strapped Lichtenburg's problems by poulticing them with dollar bills. ""Can you use any money today?"" she sings. In a preshow welcome on Wednesday, the Encores! artistic director Jack Viertel said that one reason for revisiting ""Call Me Madam"" was to see how a political satire from 1950 differed from satire today. Fair enough -- and a few lines, whether original or interpolated, elicited rueful laughter from an audience asked to recall a period of American history when a top marginal tax rate of almost 85 percent left the treasury overflowing with the potential to do good in the world.

It's not enough that young Gibson should fall in forbidden love with Lichtenburg's Princess Maria, wittily played by Lauren Worsham as a demented Dresden doll; Adams herself must also fall at first glance for Cosmo Constantine, the handsome foreign minister. Out of excess pride and nobility, he rejects her offer of $100 million to solve the duchy's problems: ""We are waiting for your country to offer the world something more than money."" But he does not reject her affection. This leads to some lovely singing, as Ms. Cusack and her Cosmo, Ben Davis, dig into pleasantly second-drawer Berlin numbers like ""Something to Dance About,"" ""Marrying for Love"" and ""The Best Thing for You."" Ms. Cusack, who seemed as if she might be under the weather on Wednesday, could not quite pull off the necessary big notes but was lovely to listen to everywhere else; Mr. Davis is a dream. Still, the songs mostly backfire dramatically by forcing us to sympathize with characters, especially Adams, whom the book otherwise wishes us to treat as objects of surprisingly coarse satire. The form and the content are hopelessly uncoupled. It is telling, regarding both Berlin in 1950 and the production today, that the secondary characters, basically free from any hope of serving the plot, come off best. Between them, Mr. Gotay and Ms. Worsham get the evergreen duet ""It's a Lovely Day Today"" as well as a charming rarity (""Once Upon a Time, Today"") and a hilariously bizarre ""local color"" ensemble, ""The Ocarina."" The choreographer, Denis Jones, has staged this bit of period nonsense as if from the inside of a cuckoo clock. But the only time the score really breaks through the fog of mildness is when Mr. Gotay and Ms. Cusack sing the contrapuntal duet Berlin wrote quickly during the show's out-of-town tryout: ""You're Just in Love."" For a wonderful moment as the melodies intertwine, you feel in Ms. Hushion's otherwise laborious production what it must have been like when big, peculiar, unsanded personalities elevated stories instead of merely serving them. You also feel, with some emotion, that Berlin understood the difference. He wasn't a musical dramatist but a songwriter, and by 1950 he saw which way the wind was blowing. At a few key moments in ""Call Me Madam,"" he interpolates the melody of ""God Bless America,"" which he'd written more than 30 years earlier.

Books,"Black, Gay and Losing Faith",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/books/review/uzodinma-iweala-speak-no-evil.html,"""The American dream"" is an apt phrase, because dreams are illogical. The immigrant lives at a remove from the land of her birth and the land of her choice; if it's not the White House reminding you that you don't belong, it's your kids, the fruition of your American dreams who end up just so, well, American. Niru, the narrator of 's ""Speak No Evil,"" would seem to be his Nigerian-born parents' greatest success: sociable and athletic, cultured and Harvard-bound. At the same time, Niru, because of his homosexuality, embodies this particular illogic: His gayness is no particular tragedy in the eyes of his peers, but an absolute betrayal of God's plan in the eyes of his parents. This is the central conflict in Iweala's slender book, one the author handles with admirable cool. Though Niru is still young (he's a senior in high school), he understands his parents even as they fail to understand him: ""Our father lives somewhere between the self-satisfaction that his success has made us soft and disgust that we are unacquainted with the brutal intensity of a world that he has effectively tamed for us.""

Iweala published his first book, ""Beasts of No Nation,"" in 2005, when he was only 23. It's a catalog of horrors narrated by a child soldier conscripted into an armed conflict in an unnamed West African country. It's less a novel than an exercise in voice, told in stylized, ungrammatical sentences. It doesn't add up to much, which is the point; it bears witness to something meaningless, then forces the reader to find meaning in atrocity. ""Speak No Evil"" is a quite different endeavor. Iweala is still interested in style, this time the kind of clarity we sometimes associate with Hemingway and mistakenly term simple. A characteristic passage: ""I can't think straight enough to remember where I put my keys, this pocket or that pocket, this pocket, yes. And my car? I slam my palms against the wall. Again. The skin turns pink. You are not like these white children, my mother says except on my palms that turn pink like their skin turns pink, but only when hurt, or scared or stressed."" We meet Niru in the winter of his senior year, at a tony Washington, D.C., private school. Released from classes because of a snowstorm, he seeks refuge at the nearby home of his dearest friend, Meredith, where her attempt to seduce him leads to the confession of his homosexuality. If the scene has the patina of an after-school special (earnestness, a touch of melodrama), Iweala deploys the present tense and an unfussy syntax to hook the reader, and it works well.

Meredith, playing the role of understanding gal pal, installs Grindr and Tinder on Niru's cellphone. Of course the boy loses the phone, and the secret comes out. The ensuing confrontation with his father is violent and heartbreaking: ""Are you really telling me the truth, that you are going out and gallivanting with the gays, the homosexuals? Where did you learn this kind of behavior? Is it in school? Is this what they are teaching you?"" Not long ago, in his column for New York magazine, Andrew Sullivan wrote that ""the radicalization of the movement's ideology and rhetoric"" is to blame for ""a retrenchment in comfort with gay equality."" Iweala gives the lie to this claim elegantly; some people just hate homosexuality, no matter how much they love their children.

Niru's mother is a cosmopolitan daughter of privilege, now a physician; his father is a ""true village boy"" who climbed his way to corporate success and American comfort. Upon discovering their son's secret, they turn to faith. ""It sometimes seems that every African living in the D.C. area goes to this church, Nigerians, Ghanaians, Cameroonians, Congolese. Some work for embassies. Some are taxi drivers. Some are illegal, but they are all truly welcome."" Well, not quite all. Niru's father takes him to his boyhood home in Nigeria, where they visit still another church. This intercession, existing in the realm of the spiritual, seems less pernicious than it actually is; it's not religion but psychological torture, and it occasions a kind of break in the narrator's psyche. His parents replace his smartphone with Bible verses. ""I take the cards -- Genesis 4:7, Luke 5:32, First Corinthians 6:18 -- and put them in my pocket without looking at them. I have a stack on a shelf in my closet. They remind me of all the things I should do."" It's not Niru who is closeted any longer; it's his parents' God. Niru's homosexuality is very much the book's subject, and the text is interested in dualities -- Americans and Africans, white and black, gay and straight, devout and skeptic, the black immigrant and the black American (a role filled by Damien, a college student with whom our hero has a sweet, chaste fling) -- while always returning to the question of what his gayness says about who Niru is. Iweala writes with such ease about adolescents and adolescence that ""Speak No Evil"" could well be a young adult novel. At the same time he toys with other well-defined forms: the immigrant novel, the gay coming-of-age novel, the novel of being black in America. The resulting book is a hybrid of all these. If he's something of a remix artist, Iweala remains faithful to the conventions of these forms, a writer so adept that the book's climax feels both surprising and wholly inevitable. Its concluding third is narrated by Meredith, not Niru, a strategy that should feel clunky but doesn't. As with ""Beasts of No Nation,"" Iweala resists offering the reader much in the way of closure or even insight, as though to suggest that's the reader's job, not his. A writer cannot be judged for his project, only its execution.  is a fine and confident novelist. Genre is a useful thing when organizing texts in a bookshop, but immaterial to the particular exchange between writer and reader.

Form ossifies into genre through repetition. Eventually readers -- and writers are of course readers themselves -- understand that stories about immigrants function in a certain way, that stories about gayness require a moral reckoning, that stories about blackness require the sacrifice of the black body. For all the interest among readers in creating a literature that reflects its readership, so-called ""diverse books,"" there are times that ""diverse book"" seems itself a genre, bound by convention and largely a matter of the identity of a writer who is different from the thousand or so writers we believe to be the canon.

The immigrant lives at a remove from the land of her birth and the land of her choice; if it's not the White House reminding you that you don't belong, it's your kids, the fruition of your American dreams who end up just so, well, American. Niru, the narrator of 's ""Speak No Evil,"" would seem to be his Nigerian-born parents' greatest success: sociable and athletic, cultured and Harvard-bound. At the same time, Niru, because of his homosexuality, embodies this particular illogic: His gayness is no particular tragedy in the eyes of his peers, but an absolute betrayal of God's plan in the eyes of his parents. This is the central conflict in Iweala's slender book, one the author handles with admirable cool. Though Niru is still young (he's a senior in high school), he understands his parents even as they fail to understand him: ""Our father lives somewhere between the self-satisfaction that his success has made us soft and disgust that we are unacquainted with the brutal intensity of a world that he has effectively tamed for us.""

Iweala published his first book, ""Beasts of No Nation,"" in 2005, when he was only 23. It's a catalog of horrors narrated by a child soldier conscripted into an armed conflict in an unnamed West African country. It's less a novel than an exercise in voice, told in stylized, ungrammatical sentences. It doesn't add up to much, which is the point; it bears witness to something meaningless, then forces the reader to find meaning in atrocity. ""Speak No Evil"" is a quite different endeavor. Iweala is still interested in style, this time the kind of clarity we sometimes associate with Hemingway and mistakenly term simple. A characteristic passage: ""I can't think straight enough to remember where I put my keys, this pocket or that pocket, this pocket, yes. And my car? I slam my palms against the wall. Again. The skin turns pink. You are not like these white children, my mother says except on my palms that turn pink like their skin turns pink, but only when hurt, or scared or stressed."" We meet Niru in the winter of his senior year, at a tony Washington, D.C., private school. Released from classes because of a snowstorm, he seeks refuge at the nearby home of his dearest friend, Meredith, where her attempt to seduce him leads to the confession of his homosexuality. If the scene has the patina of an after-school special (earnestness, a touch of melodrama), Iweala deploys the present tense and an unfussy syntax to hook the reader, and it works well.

Not long ago, in his column for New York magazine, Andrew Sullivan wrote that ""the radicalization of the movement's ideology and rhetoric"" is to blame for ""a retrenchment in comfort with gay equality."" Iweala gives the lie to this claim elegantly; some people just hate homosexuality, no matter how much they love their children.

Niru's mother is a cosmopolitan daughter of privilege, now a physician; his father is a ""true village boy"" who climbed his way to corporate success and American comfort. Upon discovering their son's secret, they turn to faith. ""It sometimes seems that every African living in the D.C. area goes to this church, Nigerians, Ghanaians, Cameroonians, Congolese. Some work for embassies. Some are taxi drivers. Some are illegal, but they are all truly welcome."" Well, not quite all. Niru's father takes him to his boyhood home in Nigeria, where they visit still another church. This intercession, existing in the realm of the spiritual, seems less pernicious than it actually is; it's not religion but psychological torture, and it occasions a kind of break in the narrator's psyche. His parents replace his smartphone with Bible verses. ""I take the cards -- Genesis 4:7, Luke 5:32, First Corinthians 6:18 -- and put them in my pocket without looking at them. I have a stack on a shelf in my closet. They remind me of all the things I should do."" It's not Niru who is closeted any longer; it's his parents' God. Niru's homosexuality is very much the book's subject, and the text is interested in dualities -- Americans and Africans, white and black, gay and straight, devout and skeptic, the black immigrant and the black American (a role filled by Damien, a college student with whom our hero has a sweet, chaste fling) -- while always returning to the question of what his gayness says about who Niru is. Iweala writes with such ease about adolescents and adolescence that ""Speak No Evil"" could well be a young adult novel. At the same time he toys with other well-defined forms: the immigrant novel, the gay coming-of-age novel, the novel of being black in America. The resulting book is a hybrid of all these. If he's something of a remix artist, Iweala remains faithful to the conventions of these forms, a writer so adept that the book's climax feels both surprising and wholly inevitable. Its concluding third is narrated by Meredith, not Niru, a strategy that should feel clunky but doesn't. As with ""Beasts of No Nation,"" Iweala resists offering the reader much in the way of closure or even insight, as though to suggest that's the reader's job, not his. A writer cannot be judged for his project, only its execution.  is a fine and confident novelist. Genre is a useful thing when organizing texts in a bookshop, but immaterial to the particular exchange between writer and reader.

Form ossifies into genre through repetition. Eventually readers -- and writers are of course readers themselves -- understand that stories about immigrants function in a certain way, that stories about gayness require a moral reckoning, that stories about blackness require the sacrifice of the black body. For all the interest among readers in creating a literature that reflects its readership, so-called ""diverse books,"" there are times that ""diverse book"" seems itself a genre, bound by convention and largely a matter of the identity of a writer who is different from the thousand or so writers we believe to be the canon.

Books,Enemies of the State: A Memoir of Coming of Age in the Soviet Union,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/books/review/girl-from-the-metropol-hotel-ludmilla-petrushevskaya.html,"THE GIRL FROM THE METROPOL HOTEL

Growing Up in Communist Russia

By Ludmilla Petrushevskaya

Translated by Anna Summers

Illustrated. 149 pp. Penguin Books. Paper, $16.

Russian literature is replete with powerful memoirs of childhood: Tolstoy, Gorky, Nabokov, Mandelstam and Tsvetayeva all wrote movingly and insightfully about growing up. And yet, when one looks for texts about children's lives after the Communist revolution, the bookshelf seems strangely empty. Where are the great memoirs of Soviet childhood? Perhaps the traditional narrative approach taken by Tolstoy or Nabokov cannot effectively depict the spare, hungry life of a child in a totalitarian state.

Ludmilla Petrushevskaya's slender, fragmentary memoir, ""The Girl From the Metropol Hotel,"" is strangely much closer in tone and craft to Soviet absurdist poetry than it is to these classic memoirs. That poetry is exemplified by authors such as Daniil Kharms and Aleksander Vvedensky, known for their farcical depictions of early Soviet life in all its casual brutality. The reader feels the echo of such poems when Petrushevskaya's younger self, a girl who's been desperately hungry for most of her life, finds herself in possession of a fistful of silver coins. What does she do? She throws them into the courtyard, watching with a smile as dirty boys swarm to retrieve them, as each dropped coin ""caused a new explosion of howling and fighting."" If this memoir of growing up on the streets of the Soviet Union follows a logic, it is the violent, chaotic logic of Soviet history itself.

As the girl from the Metropol Hotel, Petrushevskaya was born into an elite Bolshevik family in 1938, in the midst of great misfortune: Several family members were executed by Stalin's firing squads. The family became ""enemies to everyone,"" Petrushevskaya writes, ""to our neighbors, to the police, to the janitors, to the passers-by, to every resident of our courtyard of any age. We were not allowed to use the shared bathroom, to wash our clothes, and we didn't have soap anyway. At the age of 9 I was unfamiliar with shoes, with handkerchiefs, with combs; I did not know what school or discipline was.""","Ludmilla Petrushevskaya's ""The Girl from the Metropol Hotel"" is a memoir of coming of age in hardship in the Soviet Union.",0f51f504-eb7b-547a-9e90-c9435591c34d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/12/books/review/12Kaminsky-sub/12Kaminsky-sub-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=9684967e16b3f0ff09d739fa7e03e5be56532ac3f243c4b43534fefd77fd946a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ludmilla Petrushevskaya, 1948.",0f51f504-eb7b-547a-9e90-c9435591c34d,Demo_data/D1_img2/10f51f504-eb7b-547a-9e90-c9435591c34d.jpg,13,"Enemies of the State: A Memoir of Coming of Age in the Soviet Union THE GIRL FROM THE METROPOL HOTEL

Opinion,There Are Evangelicals Who Stand Against Trump. I'm One of Them.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/opinion/trump-evangelicals.html,"Like many kids who grew up as evangelicals, I was taught that abortion was the only issue when it comes to politics. When I turned 18, in the 1990s, my father took me to the Allen County Republican headquarters in my Indiana town, where I registered as a card-carrying conservative. Then we went to Fort Wayne's Famous Coney Island for celebratory chili dogs. ""It doesn't matter who is president for a term or two,"" Dad told me. ""We vote for the candidates who want to protect the dignity of human life."" And those candidates were all in the Republican Party. Though abortion was the core battle, evangelicals have rallied around various flags of the culture wars for my life. One of the first of these I remember was when Andres Serrano's photograph of a crucifix suspended in urine caused a backlash among evangelicals. Dad said it was a disgrace; I agreed with him. Neither of us knew that Serrano was Catholic -- not that knowing that would have made us more sympathetic to him -- or took seriously the interpretation that the piece was a reaction to the exploitation of Christian iconography. To us, and to the church and broader community to which we belonged, it was blasphemy. And it was worth raising hell over.

A lifetime raised in a culture prepared to go to war over immorality made it especially disorienting when Donald Trump rode down a golden escalator into the presidential campaign, and captured 81 percent of the white evangelical vote. Trump mocked a reporter with physical disabilities, bragged about groping women, retweeted comments likening him to ""the second coming of God."" He was accused by multiple women of sexual assault. He claimed he didn't pray to God for forgiveness. But instead of outrage, in defense of a basic sense of morality, loyalty to Mr. Trump only seemed to grow among white evangelicals. Their loyalty remained, even when the American president left a bunker in the White House, scattering a peaceful protest with aggressive riot-control tactics after the killing of George Floyd so he could walk to a church, hold a Bible, and have a photo taken. ""We don't like him,"" evangelical friends tell me, ""but we don't have a choice if we believe in religious liberty and the sanctity of life."" They sound a lot like my father delivering his Coney Island argument for one-issue voting back in 1996. The coming election is less about whom evangelicals are voting against and more about whom we're voting for. White American evangelicals appear to be unrattled no matter what stunts, antics, gaffes or pandering we see from the president. Our bond to the Trump administration appears to be growing even stronger. We want Mr. Trump in office. More of us do now than in 2016. The Trump administration is offering us a conservative court, and with it, the possibility of Roe v. Wade's overturn. But at the heart of this election, more than abortion, religious liberty, or any other single issue, is fear. We are afraid of losing dominance over people who look and live differently than us. Evangelicals are afraid to lose power, and Trump offers us access to it. Polls again show Trump with a commanding lead among white evangelical voters.

But about 19 percent of the millions of white voters who identify as evangelical did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016, and millions of them will not be voting for him in 2020. I'm one of them. Evangelicalism has always been a big tent, and I'm in it, too. Even though we are so deeply divided, I've seen the generative love and humanity of so many conservative Christians. Like millions of other American Christians, I'm politically progressive, and I also believe in the sanctity of all life -- whether in the womb or out. I've been a Presbyterian for 15 years, but pretending my roots aren't in evangelicalism would be disingenuous, and also allow my identity to be shaped by a stereotype I don't fit. Evangelicals are protesting after the death of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor -- we are, without hesitation, denouncing racism. Many of us are pro-all of life. We're against the death penalty, denounce white supremacists, welcome refugees and believe in equal pay for women and equal rights for all people. As a deacon at my church, I help provide homeless teenagers with meals purchased from minority-owned restaurants struggling to stay open during the pandemic. Like those in thousands of other churches, we show up for our city. The couple of million of us who stand against Mr. Trump are holding on to hope that the good work Christians do out of the spotlight can salvage our public witness and outshine the hypocrisy burning brightly from our ranks. The work of rebuilding begins with following the lead of our Black and brown brothers and sisters, bringing old sins of racism and sexism into new light. By lifting up just about anyone Mr. Trump has belittled to gain dominance. Christians are called to not just tolerate, but also welcome the stranger and serve the poor. To be hospitable, not judgmental, to people across racial, gender and socioeconomic lines. To do a better job of listening, repenting and voting with the marginalized and the underprivileged. There will most likely be overwhelming white evangelical support for Mr. Trump this election. But regardless of the outcome, there is a sizable remnant of evangelicals who will persist in choosing human flourishing over fear.

But at the heart of this election, more than abortion, religious liberty, or any other single issue, is fear. We are afraid of losing dominance over people who look and live differently than us. Evangelicals are afraid to lose power, and Trump offers us access to it. Polls again show Trump with a commanding lead among white evangelical voters.

But about 19 percent of the millions of white voters who identify as evangelical did not vote for Donald Trump in 2016, and millions of them will not be voting for him in 2020. I'm one of them. Evangelicalism has always been a big tent, and I'm in it, too. Even though we are so deeply divided, I've seen the generative love and humanity of so many conservative Christians. Like millions of other American Christians, I'm politically progressive, and I also believe in the sanctity of all life -- whether in the womb or out. I've been a Presbyterian for 15 years, but pretending my roots aren't in evangelicalism would be disingenuous, and also allow my identity to be shaped by a stereotype I don't fit. Evangelicals are protesting after the death of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor -- we are, without hesitation, denouncing racism. Many of us are pro-all of life. We're against the death penalty, denounce white supremacists, welcome refugees and believe in equal pay for women and equal rights for all people. As a deacon at my church, I help provide homeless teenagers with meals purchased from minority-owned restaurants struggling to stay open during the pandemic. Like those in thousands of other churches, we show up for our city. The couple of million of us who stand against Mr. Trump are holding on to hope that the good work Christians do out of the spotlight can salvage our public witness and outshine the hypocrisy burning brightly from our ranks. The work of rebuilding begins with following the lead of our Black and brown brothers and sisters, bringing old sins of racism and sexism into new light. By lifting up just about anyone Mr. Trump has belittled to gain dominance. Christians are called to not just tolerate, but also welcome the stranger and serve the poor. To be hospitable, not judgmental, to people across racial, gender and socioeconomic lines. To do a better job of listening, repenting and voting with the marginalized and the underprivileged. There will most likely be overwhelming white evangelical support for Mr. Trump this election. But regardless of the outcome, there is a sizable remnant of evangelicals who will persist in choosing human flourishing over fear.

We can't succumb to the president's appeals to fear.",,"There Are Evangelicals Who Stand Against Trump. I'm One of Them. Like many kids who grew up as evangelicals, I was taught that abortion was the only issue when it comes to politics. When I turned 18, in the 1990s, my father took me to the Allen County Republican headquarters in my Indiana town, where I registered as a card-carrying conservative. Then we went to Fort Wayne's Famous Coney Island for celebratory chili dogs. ""It doesn't matter who is president for a term or two,"" Dad told me. ""We vote for the candidates who want to protect the dignity of human life."" And those candidates were all in the Republican Party. Though abortion was the core battle, evangelicals have rallied around various flags of the culture wars for my life. One of the first of these I remember was when Andres Serrano's photograph of a crucifix suspended in urine caused a backlash among evangelicals. Dad said it was a disgrace; I agreed with him. Neither of us knew that Serrano was Catholic -- not that knowing that would have made us more sympathetic to him -- or took seriously the interpretation that the piece was a reaction to the exploitation of Christian iconography. To us, and to the church and broader community to which we belonged, it was blasphemy. And it was worth raising hell over.

A lifetime raised in a culture prepared to go to war over immorality made it especially disorienting when Donald Trump rode down a golden escalator into the presidential campaign, and captured 81 percent of the white evangelical vote. Trump mocked a reporter with physical disabilities, bragged about groping women, retweeted comments likening him to ""the second coming of God."" He was accused by multiple women of sexual assault. He claimed he didn't pray to God for forgiveness. But instead of outrage, in defense of a basic sense of morality, loyalty to Mr. Trump only seemed to grow among white evangelicals. Their loyalty remained, even when the American president left a bunker in the White House, scattering a peaceful protest with aggressive riot-control tactics after the killing of George Floyd so he could walk to a church, hold a Bible, and have a photo taken. ""We don't like him,"" evangelical friends tell me, ""but we don't have a choice if we believe in religious liberty and the sanctity of life."" They sound a lot like my father delivering his Coney Island argument for one-issue voting back in 1996. The coming election is less about whom evangelicals are voting against and more about whom we're voting for. White American evangelicals appear to be unrattled no matter what stunts, antics, gaffes or pandering we see from the president. Our bond to the Trump administration appears to be growing even stronger. We want Mr. Trump in office. More of us do now than in 2016.

Real Estate,The Closed Kitchen Makes a Comeback,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/realestate/the-closed-kitchen-makes-a-comeback.html,"During a New Year's Eve dinner party several years ago, fun and laughter quickly turned to anguish for Jennifer McAllister-Nevins. The pipes in her kitchen were suddenly blocked. And because she lived in a TriBeCa apartment with an open kitchen, all the guests got to witness each chaotic moment as the sink backed up. It's no surprise that Ms. McAllister-Nevins, who loves to entertain, now lives in a different TriBeCa loft, one with an enclosed kitchen. ""Sometimes I'm not as organized as I hoped, and other times there's just a mess,"" she said. Her next event at home is a party next month for Savor, a company she owns with a friend, which makes stylish keepsake boxes. ""I like having the option of having your kitchen be a private or public space.""

Open-kitchen floor plans have dominated home design for years, especially in new construction, and kitchen size has expanded as a result. Reviewing average kitchen size in a dozen new developments and apartment building conversions before 2000, the real estate firm Engel & Volkers found that the average kitchen accounted for about 6 percent of the total square footage of the apartment. But in comparable developments after 2010, the agency found that as kitchens have been opened up to adjoining dining or living rooms, the average kitchen now takes up about 8 percent of the entire apartment.

Kitchen size aside, the pendulum has started to swing back toward enclosed kitchens. Several new residential buildings in Manhattan have offered separated kitchens -- a nod to prewar apartment design, but also to the growing demand from potential buyers looking for separate cooking and entertaining spaces. ""I grew up in the Upper East Side and never saw an open kitchen,"" said Edward Yedid, a partner of Grade New York, an interior design and architecture firm. When designing the Twenty 1, a nine-unit condominium at 117 West 21st Street in Chelsea, Mr. Yedid decided to separate the kitchens because the units were all floor-through, with space to incorporate walls and hallways. He chose to use sliding solid oak doors in the kitchen in six units, so the residents would have ""control on how they used the kitchen,"" he said. ""For someone who isn't sure if they want an open or closed kitchen, pocket doors are a great feature,"" Mr. Yedid said.

Mark Kolodziejczak, a partner of Studio Tractor Architecture, a firm hired by Ms. McAllister-Nevins to renovate her current TriBeCa loft, said he has long discussions with clients about how they foresee using the kitchen. Do they prefer having a kitchen that will be the social center of the home or something more muted? While the kitchen in Ms. McAllister-Nevins's new apartment was separate from the entertaining space, it did not have doors, so she decided to install two large pocket doors, a design accent that seems to be gaining popularity. Of the roughly 450 respondents to a recent survey by the National Kitchen and Bath Association, a trade group made up of kitchen and bath designers and suppliers, about 70 percent said they used pocket doors as part of a kitchen remodeling or new construction project in 2015. Bryan Cho, an executive vice president of the Related Companies, said his company had not built a residential building with a closed-kitchen floor plan since the 1990s. But demand for larger rental apartments for families was high, he said, so Related included 45 three- and four-bedroom apartments in the Easton, a high-rise rental at 205 East 92nd Street with 230 units. All these larger units will have closed kitchens. Some will have open entries; others will have space for a small table, or a dining alcove attached. ""I think some people are attracted to a more formal way of life, so maybe the trend is shifting between having a big open space to cook and entertain to having some separation,"" Mr. Cho said.

But if you have more room, you can get creative, said Mr. Penick, whose company is a developer of 53W53, a condominium tower that is rising next to the Museum of Modern Art. More than 90 percent of the units in the building will have separate kitchens that can be closed by a floor-to-ceiling automatic sliding door, he said. The extra wall space created by enclosing a kitchen opens up more design options, Mr. Penick said. ""There's more storage, more counter space and room to populate kitchen-specific designs."" Closed kitchens also work well for those who entertain a lot and hire caterers and private chefs. ""You don't want your dinner party guests to walk through the kitchen and see what's being served,"" said Phillip Mendlow, a senior vice president of Bluerock Real Estate, which developed the Charles, a 27-unit condominium on the Upper East Side where all apartments come with closed kitchens.

Some developers are also testing out hybrid kitchen floor plans. Ian Schrager, a developer who recently broke ground on 160 Leroy, said all of the 49 condo units will have two fully equipped kitchens. The 300-square-foot enclosed chef's kitchen can be closed off by a sliding door, while the adjacent open ""social kitchen"" is anchored by a large marble island and countertop. He said he took the idea from his own home, where he custom-installed a second, ""dirty"" kitchen. ""I personally don't mind when people cook and wash dishes in front of me,"" Mr. Schrager said. ""I like the social aspect of an open kitchen. But some people don't like that."" The two-kitchen concept isn't new. Many farms and suburban homes traditionally had second kitchens, often called summer kitchens, so the heat from the stove didn't raise the temperature in the entire house during the summer. In a stand-alone hut on the property, or in a small room in the back of the house or in the basement, they were used for butchering meat and making and preserving jams.","The pendulum is starting to swing back toward enclosed kitchens.

By several counts, Budweiser led the pack of game day advertisers with a spot that depicted its iconic Clydesdale horses rescuing a lost puppy and taking it home. The ad attracted more than 4.2 million online views by midday Monday and captured 12 percent of online activity about the Super Bowl spots, according to a measurement firm, iSpot.tv.

Budweiser, which also ran an ad celebrating its brewing process, was mentioned more than 234,000 times on social media during the game, with nearly half of the comments expressing a positive sentiment and many more neutral, according to Amobee, which tracks digital response to brands.

In stark contrast, another much-talked-about spot was Nationwide's morbid commercial that showed a young boy saying that he will never learn to ride a bike, get ""cooties,"" learn to fly, travel the world or marry because he died from a preventable accident. While the brand was trying to highlight its ""Make Safe Happen"" program about increasing safety at home, the spot angered viewers.

Nationwide was mentioned more than 238,000 times on social media, with 64 percent of those comments negative, according to Amobee. (Nationwide ran another spot featuring the actress Mindy Kaling that seemed to resonate more positively.) ""The sole purpose of this message was to start a conversation, not sell insurance,"" Nationwide said in a statement. ""We want to build awareness of an issue that is near and dear to all of us -- the safety and well being of our children.""

Another highlight was a commercial for Procter & Gamble's Always feminine products that asked what it meant to do a physical activity ""like a girl."" The ad focused on how girls often lose their confidence after they go through puberty. It showed little girls answering the question by running fast and punching strong, while older children and adults answered by acting weak.

The Always spot captured 8.6 percent of online activity and 1.6 million viewers, according to iSpot.tv. NBC showed 48 minutes of ads during Sunday's game, according to Kantar Media. That included about seven minutes of network promotions. Sunday's game featured ads from 15 first-time Super Bowl advertisers. Amobee said that the ""Rookie of the Year"" award went to Skittles, which generated more than 85,000 social mentions, more than three times those for some other newbies.

The ad attracted more than 4.2 million online views by midday Monday and captured 12 percent of online activity about the Super Bowl spots, according to a measurement firm, iSpot.tv.

Budweiser, which also ran an ad celebrating its brewing process, was mentioned more than 234,000 times on social media during the game, with nearly half of the comments expressing a positive sentiment and many more neutral, according to Amobee, which tracks digital response to brands.

In stark contrast, another much-talked-about spot was Nationwide's morbid commercial that showed a young boy saying that he will never learn to ride a bike, get ""cooties,"" learn to fly, travel the world or marry because he died from a preventable accident. While the brand was trying to highlight its ""Make Safe Happen"" program about increasing safety at home, the spot angered viewers.

Nationwide was mentioned more than 238,000 times on social media, with 64 percent of those comments negative, according to Amobee. (Nationwide ran another spot featuring the actress Mindy Kaling that seemed to resonate more positively.) ""The sole purpose of this message was to start a conversation, not sell insurance,"" Nationwide said in a statement. ""We want to build awareness of an issue that is near and dear to all of us -- the safety and well being of our children.""

Another highlight was a commercial for Procter & Gamble's Always feminine products that asked what it meant to do a physical activity ""like a girl."" The ad focused on how girls often lose their confidence after they go through puberty. It showed little girls answering the question by running fast and punching strong, while older children and adults answered by acting weak.

The Always spot captured 8.6 percent of online activity and 1.6 million viewers, according to iSpot.tv. NBC showed 48 minutes of ads during Sunday's game, according to Kantar Media. That included about seven minutes of network promotions. Sunday's game featured ads from 15 first-time Super Bowl advertisers. Amobee said that the ""Rookie of the Year"" award went to Skittles, which generated more than 85,000 social mentions, more than three times those for some other newbies. In addition to its humorous spot, the brand received a boost when Marshawn Lynch, the Seahawks running back, was seen gobbling the rainbow-colored candy moments before the game began. The Budweiser ad, which also featured the brand's Clydesdale horses, scored big on social media, while a Nationwide spot angered viewers.",3,['3'],3

Sports,UConn? Worried? Not as Long as Auriemma Is in Charge,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/sports/ncaabasketball/uconn-womens-basketball.html,"UNCASVILLE, Conn. -- No, Geno Auriemma said with customary bluntness, he is not worried about the coronavirus outbreak. And he finds it a bit absurd that teams are being asked to refrain from postgame handshakes after sharing a germ-ridden basketball and sweating all over one another for two hours. ""I mean, come on,"" he said. Nor does Auriemma share conventional wisdom that the dynasty that is Connecticut women's basketball might be in jeopardy in his 35th season as head coach. In fact, he has a new joke to deflate such thinking. ""You know how many religions there are in the world?"" Auriemma said. ""The one religion in women's college basketball is praying that UConn loses."" For the record, UConn defeated Cincinnati, 87-53, in the A.A.C. tournament final on Monday. The conference tournament was played at the Mohegan Sun casino complex in Uncasville, Conn., and, amid the jingle of slot machines and the spinning of roulette wheels, UConn success was hardly a gamble. The Huskies have played 139 games in the conference and have won them all. They will never lose, in fact, as they are set to return to the Big East next season.

But success in the N.C.A.A. tournament is no longer such a sure bet. UConn has appeared in 12 consecutive Final Fours, yet no player on the current roster has won a national title. A 13th straight trip to the national semifinals this season seems uncertain after losses by double-digits to the country's three best teams: South Carolina, Oregon and Baylor. A 12th national title for Auriemma has remained elusive since 2016. What does it mean? For starters, it means that UConn has set such an impossibly high standard that even the slightest leveling brings prewritten obituaries on the pending death of the Huskies' dominance. Does it mean anything else? Is this young team, which has lacked depth and the Huskies' usual big-game swagger, a mere anomaly? Or are we witnessing an inevitable flattening out caused by a shift reflected by the arc of history, unsettling financial realities at UConn, the changing nature of recruiting and the continued broadening of the women's game westward and southward? First, a couple of caveats. UConn (29-3) has lost this season only to three surefire No. 1 seeds in the N.C.A.A. tournament. Four current starters will return next year. And this year's thin team will be buttressed next season by a highly-regarded transfer and five freshmen, including the nation's top recruit, Paige Bueckers, a 5-foot-11 inch guard from Eden Prairie, Minn. Already, her skill and temperament have drawn comparisons to the former UConn star Diana Taurasi. So no one is exactly pushing the panic button.

The men's and women's college game have developed at a nearly identical pace. But U.C.L.A. has won only one title since 1975, and it is now only a middling power in an age of increased parity. Can UConn, bucolic but isolated in Storrs, Conn., avoid a similar drift? Especially with an athletic department that ran a deficit of more than $40 million in fiscal 2019 and exists outside a Power 5 conference, while women's powers in the Southeastern, Pac 12 and Big 12 conferences offer verdant campuses and the security of football bounty? Check out the men's rankings, Auriemma admonished when I brought up the issue. Seven of the top 16 teams -- Gonzaga, Dayton and San Diego State among them -- are not from Power 5 conferences. Neither is Villanova, which won national titles in 2016 and in 2018. ""I can't speak for after I leave, but as long as I'm coaching here, we won't be hard to find,"" Auriemma said. ""We won't be drifting away. You'll know exactly where we are. And that's not going to change one iota."" Auriemma turns 66 this month. And he said he could see himself coaching another five years. UConn is in the hunt for the nation's top projected recruit for 2021, Azzi Fudd, a 5-foot-11 guard from Washington, D.C., and a close friend of Bueckers, the incoming freshman star. Recruits now often want something more personal than a coach-player relationship. Dawn Staley of South Carolina, the 2017 national champion, signed four of the top 13 high school players for the current season after her staff applied a full-court press ""talking to every single person that's involved in their lives."" Auriemma prefers to be seen as an instructor, not a friend, to his players. To adjust, he now casts a wider net for talent. For next season, he has signed, among others, guards from Canada and Croatia. Evina Westbrook, a transfer guard from Tennessee sitting out this season, also will be eligible.","After a trying season for Coach Geno Auriemma and his team, UConn's women find themselves in a familiar position: with a chance to win a 12th national championship.",b6221509-ec38-5039-946d-9876013cd065,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/10/sports/10uconn-top/10uconn-top-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=60861a01adc3c43aacbe95957a80433dc1b37d58cbcc15b293a7f48a8bb73c36&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,UConn spent seven years in the American Athletic Conference and never lost a game.,b6221509-ec38-5039-946d-9876013cd065,Demo_data/D1_img2/1b6221509-ec38-5039-946d-9876013cd065.jpg,9,"UConn?

Opinion,'We Were Always Men',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/opinion/15th-amendment-anniversary-gates.html,"The received scientific wisdom of the day drew from the same pool of ""self-evident truths"" as did Chief Justice Taney. The Swiss naturalist Louis Agassiz offered the same rationale for slavery. Agassiz had come to believe that people of different races had not descended from a single Adam, but rather from different Adams, who lived in different parts of the world. Therefore, he said, it would be a mistake ""to assume that races have the same abilities, enjoy the same powers, and show the same natural dispositions, and that in consequence of this equality they are entitled to the same position in human society.""

Douglass knew that all else in the quest for the abolition of slavery, and equal status and protection under the laws depended on the refutation of the scandalous allegation that the genetic origins and social and cultural evolution of black people constituted prima facie justification for their second-class status.

He had to devote much of his oratory simply to ""proving"" the humanity of black people. Speaking at Western Reserve College in 1854, in one of the first commencement addresses ever delivered by an African-American, Douglass deconstructed word by word a recent editorial in the notoriously racist Richmond Examiner that argued that ""the negro"" did not have the same right to liberty and the pursuit of happiness as the white man. The reason: ""BECAUSE HE IS NOT A MAN.""

Douglass, in his remarks, made his own declaration: ""Tried by all the usual, and all the unusual tests, whether mental, moral, physical, or psychological, the negro is a MAN -- considering him as possessing knowledge, or needing knowledge, his elevation or his degradation, his virtues, or his vices -- whichever road you take, you reach the same conclusion: The negro is a MAN.""

Sixteen years later, when the 15th Amendment was ratified, Douglass knew that while one battle may have been won, the forces of white supremacy and pro-slavery stubbornly persisted, as he warned in his speech ""Our Composite Nationality"" in 1869. Unfortunately, he was right: The promises of Reconstruction gave way to the destructive emergence of Jim Crow. In the continued need for African-Americans to account for their own humanity, we see permutations of Douglass's struggle: from the British antislavery catchphrase popularized in the 1780s, ""Am I Not a Man and a Brother?,"" to the Memphis sanitation workers' signs proclaiming ""I Am a Man"" on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination and in the very phrase ""Black Lives Matter.""

Much has been made lately of the metaphor that anti-black racism is part of the DNA of American culture. Some have taken offense, presuming incorrectly that the genetic allusion suggests that America is unalterably racist. Rather, the metaphor means to say that anti-black racism has been passed down through the generations as an elemental aspect of American history and American culture.

Genetics is not determinism. The 20,000 or so genes that compose the human genome can each be silenced or amplified. Think of our genomes as akin to a piano keyboard: The melodies it yields depend upon how it's played. Racism, like anti-Semitism, is a chord that we can choose to play or not. Or think of racism as a cultural mutation. The introduction of that tainted mutation into our country's founding -- and the weight it continues to place on black people to prove themselves worthy of inclusion over and over again -- is what is meant by racism being part of our DNA. Mutations cannot be silenced by pretending they are not there; they cannot be silenced by being censored or shouted down. Mutations do not magically go away. But they can be combated, as the 15th Amendment sought to combat the long history of denying the manhood of black American men.","One hundred and fifty years ago, Frederick Douglass understood the link between voting rights and manhood for African-Americans.",90da9130-079d-5c7d-9492-fe26b9b22201,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/10/opinion/10Gates/10Gates-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=1f167ea9e5729051646324dbe0104c89e78ab43183da5b4c454be4e945596acb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"One of several large commemorative prints marking the enactment of the Fifteenth Amendment, on March 30, 1870.",90da9130-079d-5c7d-9492-fe26b9b22201,Demo_data/D1_img2/190da9130-079d-5c7d-9492-fe26b9b22201.jpg,11,"'We Were Always Men' The received scientific wisdom of the day drew from the same pool of ""self-evident truths"" as did Chief Justice Taney.

Think of our genomes as akin to a piano keyboard: The melodies it yields depend upon how it's played. Racism, like anti-Semitism, is a chord that we can choose to play or not. Or think of racism as a cultural mutation. The introduction of that tainted mutation into our country's founding -- and the weight it continues to place on black people to prove themselves worthy of inclusion over and over again -- is what is meant by racism being part of our DNA. Mutations cannot be silenced by pretending they are not there; they cannot be silenced by being censored or shouted down. Mutations do not magically go away. But they can be combated, as the 15th Amendment sought to combat the long history of denying the manhood of black American men. One hundred and fifty years ago, Frederick Douglass understood the link between voting rights and manhood for African-Americans.",,"'We Were Always Men' The received scientific wisdom of the day drew from the same pool of ""self-evident truths"" as did Chief Justice Taney. The Swiss naturalist Louis Agassiz offered the same rationale for slavery. Agassiz had come to believe that people of different races had not descended from a single Adam, but rather from different Adams, who lived in different parts of the world. Therefore, he said, it would be a mistake ""to assume that races have the same abilities, enjoy the same powers, and show the same natural dispositions, and that in consequence of this equality they are entitled to the same position in human society.""

Douglass knew that all else in the quest for the abolition of slavery, and equal status and protection under the laws depended on the refutation of the scandalous allegation that the genetic origins and social and cultural evolution of black people constituted prima facie justification for their second-class status.

He had to devote much of his oratory simply to ""proving"" the humanity of black people. Speaking at Western Reserve College in 1854, in one of the first commencement addresses ever delivered by an African-American, Douglass deconstructed word by word a recent editorial in the notoriously racist Richmond Examiner that argued that ""the negro"" did not have the same right to liberty and the pursuit of happiness as the white man. The reason: ""BECAUSE HE IS NOT A MAN.""

Douglass, in his remarks, made his own declaration: ""Tried by all the usual, and all the unusual tests, whether mental, moral, physical, or psychological, the negro is a MAN -- considering him as possessing knowledge, or needing knowledge, his elevation or his degradation, his virtues, or his vices -- whichever road you take, you reach the same conclusion: The negro is a MAN.""

Sixteen years later, when the 15th Amendment was ratified, Douglass knew that while one battle may have been won, the forces of white supremacy and pro-slavery stubbornly persisted, as he warned in his speech ""Our Composite Nationality"" in 1869. Unfortunately, he was right: The promises of Reconstruction gave way to the destructive emergence of Jim Crow. In the continued need for African-Americans to account for their own humanity, we see permutations of Douglass's struggle: from the British antislavery catchphrase popularized in the 1780s, ""Am I Not a Man and a Brother?,"" to the Memphis sanitation workers' signs proclaiming ""I Am a Man"" on the eve of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination and in the very phrase ""Black Lives Matter.""

Much has been made lately of the metaphor that anti-black racism is part of the DNA of American culture. Some have taken offense, presuming incorrectly that the genetic allusion suggests that America is unalterably racist. Rather, the metaphor means to say that anti-black racism has been passed down through the generations as an elemental aspect of American history and American culture.

Genetics is not determinism. The 20,000 or so genes that compose the human genome can each be silenced or amplified.

Health,Doctors Press F.D.A. to Let More Gay Men Donate Blood,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/health/us-blood-donation-rules-gay-men.html,"More than 500 doctors, researchers and public health specialists are calling on the Food and Drug Administration to eliminate constraints on blood donations by gay and bisexual men, saying the agency did not go far enough when it relaxed its restrictions earlier this month.

The demand was made in a letter dated Thursday that was written by two doctors at the University of California, San Francisco, and signed by hundreds of medical professionals at places like Emory University, Harvard Medical School and the University of Florida. Dispensing with the rules, the letter said, would help to address a drastic drop in the blood supply during the coronavirus pandemic.

The F.D.A.'s restrictions date to 1983, early in the AIDS epidemic, when the agency banned donations from gay and bisexual men outright for fear of introducing H.I.V. into the nation's blood supply. In 2015, the agency scrapped the lifetime ban but continued to bar donations from men who had had sex with men in the previous 12 months, arguing that the waiting period was necessary to keep the blood supply safe.

On April 2, after donations dropped precipitously as blood drives were canceled nationwide because of the coronavirus, the agency shortened the deferral period to three months from one year, saying that recent studies had shown that doing so would not compromise the safety of the blood supply.",A letter signed by more than 500 medical professionals cited recent fears of a blood shortage during the coronavirus pandemic.,27e01661-4697-5ceb-a3fa-8e7a7e047c7c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/16/us/16xp-blood-image2/16xp-blood-image2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=d76e99ed39e130ae77e00de57c17dc7cab667e4f04fcedd07bc3c552e667c6dc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Eliminating restrictions on blood donations by gay and bisexual men would help to address a shortage related to the coronavirus pandemic, according to a letter to the F.D.A. signed by hundreds of medical professionals.",27e01661-4697-5ceb-a3fa-8e7a7e047c7c,Demo_data/D1_img2/127e01661-4697-5ceb-a3fa-8e7a7e047c7c.jpg,1,"Doctors Press F.D.A. to Let More Gay Men Donate Blood More than 500 doctors, researchers and public health specialists are calling on the Food and Drug Administration to eliminate constraints on blood donations by gay and bisexual men, saying the agency did not go far enough when it relaxed its restrictions earlier this month.

How they met: Ms. O'Toole was Mr. Thomas's Uber driver Sept. 10, 2016. Wedding details: March 16, 2019, on campus at Georgetown, where Ms. O'Toole went to college. Ms. O'Toole: On Saturday, Sept. 10, 2016, I decided that it would be a great weekend to make some extra cash because there was a huge festival, LouFest, in St. Louis where I lived at the time. I gave five or six rides that morning and was about to take a lunch break when one more ride request came in. I drove to the pickup point and two female passengers got into my back seat and told me that one more person would be coming -- their cousin, Jared. I saw a handsome, redheaded, blue-eyed man walked my way and I was very happy when he opened the front seat of my car and hopped in. ""Hey Micaela! How's your day going?"" he said. We talked the whole way. It felt like we were already friends.

At some point in the trip, I said, ""Wow, you have a lot of freckles! Who has more?"" I then blushed because I couldn't believe I just asked him that question. Jared put his arm next to my freckly arm and we compared -- he definitely had me beat. As the ride came to an end, I went back and forth in my head thinking, Should I ask this guy for his number? I chickened out. As I watched him walk away, I said to myself, If he's the one, then we'll meet again. About a month after LouFest, I decided to get back on Bumble, the dating app. I'd gone on several Bumble dates before, but took a break because I wasn't finding much out there. I kept swiping through these bachelor's profiles and then -- boom! It was Jared! I quickly sent him a message without thinking twice. He responded within 24 hours and asked me out. We went on our first date the following day, and then had three more dates. By the end of the first week, we were in love. I called my mom and was like, This is it. After eight months of dating, he got down on one knee and popped the question. Mr. Thomas: I was late getting to the Uber, but when I did, I saw the most beautiful girl sitting in the driver's seat. I'll never forget the great big smile she had on her face. We talked the whole trip -- 18 minutes long, $16.10 -- and I remember thinking how cool and easy to talk to she was. When the ride finally came to an end, I got out, and Micaela drove away. I turned to my cousin and said, Micaela: That was the one that got away. Why didn't you ask for her number? she asked. I told her I choked under pressure. Even though I was surrounded by great music, good beer, and enjoying a perfect fall day in St. Louis, I couldn't help thinking about that pretty girl who drove me to Loufest who was so friendly and amicable. I halfheartedly joked with my cousin and said, I wonder what Micaela is up to right now, and I wonder if she's thinking about me, too. But that was it. I never saw or heard from her again -- until one Monday morning I woke up early to go to work, and noticed a message on my Bumble dating app. It said: After the ride, Ms. O'Toole and Mr. Thomas reconnected on the dating app Bumble.

Mr. Guerrero: I work in Murray Hill and was going to the West Village from 23rd Street and Seventh Avenue. Usually every time you get into a ride share everyone's on their phones, tapping away. Most people sit there and don't move. But the woman in the back had moved over to let me in. We had six minutes together. In that time, we hit on everything: politics, where we lived, nationalism, immigration, and how much we don't like Trump. I got to my stop near 10th and Hudson and Angie said, ""Do you live in this neighborhood?"" I said no, I was seeing my friend's band at Cowgirl. ""That's right around the corner from my house,"" she said. So I invited her to join me. I've never done that before. It was so bold. I had just gotten over a relationship and wasn't really looking. But she seemed really nice. She said yes. We got out of the car and that was the first time we really saw each other. She had nice, tall legs. I was like, Wow, O.K. I figured she'd stay for a drink and leave. I felt good that I had put myself on a limb. We had a nightcap and I got her phone number. We settled on a date two weeks later to see a Johnny Thunder tribute show at the Music Hall of Williamsburg.

We got along well until a girl threw her drink at her. Angie threw her drink back! I got in the middle of the two women; her boyfriend was about three feet taller than I am. I grabbed our bags, her work bag, coats, sweaters. I got the bouncer to throw them out. We spent the following weekend together, and we've been inseparable since. We have our own hashtag on social media: #findloveinavia. Ms. Sorenson: When he asked me to join him after the ride, I said yes. I had gotten out of a relationship a couple of years before and thought, why not? I'm pretty impulsive, and I love live music. On our first real date a few weeks later, we were watching the band when all of a sudden my back was soaking wet. I have no idea what I did! I left and realized I had none of my belongings. A minute later out came Alirio holding everything. I knew right then this guy was a keeper. He totally took care of me. We went somewhere else and talked for hours. He missed his train to New Jersey. We took a Via back to my place. and I let him stay on the couch. In hindsight, I should thank that girl. On Jan. 12, we went to Austin to see Alejandro Escovedo play. During the song ""Wedding Day,"" Alirio asked me to marry him. We flew home on Southwest. The flight attendant asked if we were together. Alirio told her we had just gotten engaged. The flight attendant said, ""We're going to marry you!"" We walked to the front of the plane. She made a veil out of a napkin. They gave us wings and we said, ""With things wings I thee wed."" Everyone is laughing and clapping and a group of kids on a church retreat did a chant for us. Another passenger, a photographer, took pictures. Now we have to invite all those people to the real wedding.

Nick Marzano and Melissa Schipke shared an UberPool. They were married June 2. Occupations: Ms. Schipke is the founder and chief executive of Tassl; Mr. Marzano works in continuing medical education in Philadelphia. Mr. Marzano: It was about 7:30 p.m., and I'd been working late at my office. I was waiting in the lobby for my Uber, en route to a Bumble first date. It was pouring outside. A woman was standing next to me and then an alert popped up on my app: Melissa will be joining your ride. I put two and two together and asked the woman if she was Melissa. She said yes, but was surprised. She then asked if I'd gone to Penn State. I had, but I was super confused. We jumped in the car and connected the dots. She founded a tech company that does business intelligence for alumni associations. By the time I got out, my mind was completely off my date. We exchanged business cards on the really shoddy pretense that since I work in digital learning and she works in tech, we should get drinks some time. So we did. It turns out that we had connected on Bumble six months earlier. I don't know if we believe our meeting was fated, but we feel incredibly fortunate that we didn't miss each other that night. It does seem that we were supposed to be together. She had emailed with my father in 2014 -- they had met at a business networking thing. She was a panelist at an entrepreneurship event for my organization a few weeks earlier. A mutual friend, another tech founder, had wanted to set us up. It was unbelievable, really. We were engaged six months after we met.

Ms. Schipke: I was in a very talkative mood that night because I'd just come from a networking event. I always have this terrible problem -- I never know if I'm on a networking thing or a date. Nick is a very attractive-looking man, but I'd pushed the idea of dating out of my mind. I don't have time to date. I was on the I-don't-think-I'll-ever-get-married plan. As a business owner my life is the company that I own. It's always been really hard to find someone who appreciates that. But Nick and I are both driven and have a similar goofy sense of humor. It turns out our circles overlapped. We have so many people in common and it was weird. I believe in good timing. If we'd met two months earlier in the same way, it would have been different. Ed Santos and Jill Sciuto were married in March. They were set up by a friend of Ms. Sciuto who had shared an Uber with Mr. Santos. Occupations: Ms. Sciuto is a public relations executive; Mr. Santos is a relationship manager at a corporate bank. How they met: Ms. Sciuto's close friend, Rachel Givens, met Mr. Santos in an Uber on Nov. 27, 2015, driving from Manhattan to Brooklyn. Mr. Santos: I typically don't choose UberPool, but for whatever reason that day I did. It was Thanksgiving weekend 2015. I'd been out with friends in the East Village and at 2 a.m. took an Uber to take me back to Brooklyn. I had a nice conversation with the woman next to me, Rachel. We were talking about relationships, and I told her I was single. She said, I think I have someone for you and I'll put you in touch.

I was a little skeptical, but she showed me a photo and I thought her friend was very attractive. I was interested right away. Jill and I met the next weekend, Dec. 6. It went better than either of us had expected. I really liked her in person, and I wanted to see her again, but we were both going away for Christmas. I felt a certain longing. I was excited to get back to the city to see her. A few weeks into our relationship I took a job assignment in Dallas and we were long distance for a little while. But we made it work. This experience helps me believe that fate is at hand. When I saw the photo and met her in person, my heart and my gut told me something. I really trusted my instincts. This whole thing was happenstance and luck -- but you have to be open enough to see it. Ms. Sciuto: I remember getting a text on a Saturday morning from my friend Rachel: Would you be interested in going out with this guy I met in my UberPool? I said O.K. I think that fate plays a lot in different parts of life. I thought, why not? What have I got to lose? The saying ""One door closes and another one opens,"" has always been in my head throughout various milestones of my life. Ed made me wait a few days before hearing from him -- and I loved that. Not too eager. Our first date was around 2 in the afternoon at the Happiest Hour, a bar in the West Village. We took a walk through the neighborhood, stopping for a drink and something to eat. I got home at 10 that night and called my cousin, my best friend. I told her about all the places we went and what a great personality Ed had. You don't think you're going to meet someone like this. It's a funny, interesting way to find the love of your life. Excerpt from a speech by Rachel Givens at their wedding: Jill and I met in college at Boston University. Always the life of the party, her smile can light up any room, and she is one of my most driven, loyal and fun friends. What always stuck out to me the most was her positive outlook on the future. While she was single in the city, she celebrated it because she knew the right guy would appear one day, and she was confident that she'd just know it when he did.

I got in Uber that night, and we picked up a guy. The very first thing I noticed about him was that he was holding a plate of tacos. All I could do was look down at my pizza and laugh at our stellar choice of late-night snacks. Knowing we were both headed to Brooklyn, I introduced myself and asked him how he liked living there. I told him that my husband and I had lived there only six months, but that we loved it. Without hesitation, he asked if we could all be friends, as he didn't know anyone in the neighborhood. It was so endearing. You don't meet a ton of chatty strangers in New York City willing to laugh at themselves, let alone over their late-night snacking habits. Jill's face immediately popped into my head. Why? Because Jill would be all about chatting in an Uber at 2 a.m., with pizza on her lap, no less. She would have also already asked about where his tacos where from, what level of spice they were, and if she could try them. She loves diving headfirst into conversations with new people, wherever it may be! That was when I asked him if he was single. He was. Would he be interested in meeting an amazing, beautiful friend of mine? He would.","For some people, car services like Uber and Via provide more than just transportation.

I figured she'd stay for a drink and leave. I felt good that I had put myself on a limb. We had a nightcap and I got her phone number. We settled on a date two weeks later to see a Johnny Thunder tribute show at the Music Hall of Williamsburg.

We got along well until a girl threw her drink at her. Angie threw her drink back! I got in the middle of the two women; her boyfriend was about three feet taller than I am. I grabbed our bags, her work bag, coats, sweaters. I got the bouncer to throw them out. We spent the following weekend together, and we've been inseparable since. We have our own hashtag on social media: #findloveinavia. Ms. Sorenson: When he asked me to join him after the ride, I said yes. I had gotten out of a relationship a couple of years before and thought, why not? I'm pretty impulsive, and I love live music. On our first real date a few weeks later, we were watching the band when all of a sudden my back was soaking wet. I have no idea what I did! I left and realized I had none of my belongings. A minute later out came Alirio holding everything. I knew right then this guy was a keeper. He totally took care of me. We went somewhere else and talked for hours. He missed his train to New Jersey. We took a Via back to my place. and I let him stay on the couch. In hindsight, I should thank that girl. On Jan. 12, we went to Austin to see Alejandro Escovedo play. During the song ""Wedding Day,"" Alirio asked me to marry him. We flew home on Southwest. The flight attendant asked if we were together. Alirio told her we had just gotten engaged. The flight attendant said, ""We're going to marry you!"" We walked to the front of the plane. She made a veil out of a napkin. They gave us wings and we said, ""With things wings I thee wed."" Everyone is laughing and clapping and a group of kids on a church retreat did a chant for us. Another passenger, a photographer, took pictures. Now we have to invite all those people to the real wedding.

Nick Marzano and Melissa Schipke shared an UberPool. They were married June 2. Occupations: Ms. Schipke is the founder and chief executive of Tassl; Mr. Marzano works in continuing medical education in Philadelphia. Mr. Marzano: It was about 7:30 p.m., and I'd been working late at my office. I was waiting in the lobby for my Uber, en route to a Bumble first date. It was pouring outside. A woman was standing next to me and then an alert popped up on my app: Melissa will be joining your ride. I put two and two together and asked the woman if she was Melissa. She said yes, but was surprised. She then asked if I'd gone to Penn State. I had, but I was super confused. We jumped in the car and connected the dots. She founded a tech company that does business intelligence for alumni associations. By the time I got out, my mind was completely off my date. We exchanged business cards on the really shoddy pretense that since I work in digital learning and she works in tech, we should get drinks some time. So we did. It turns out that we had connected on Bumble six months earlier. I don't know if we believe our meeting was fated, but we feel incredibly fortunate that we didn't miss each other that night. It does seem that we were supposed to be together. She had emailed with my father in 2014 -- they had met at a business networking thing. She was a panelist at an entrepreneurship event for my organization a few weeks earlier. A mutual friend, another tech founder, had wanted to set us up. It was unbelievable, really. We were engaged six months after we met.

Ms. Schipke: I was in a very talkative mood that night because I'd just come from a networking event. I always have this terrible problem -- I never know if I'm on a networking thing or a date. Nick is a very attractive-looking man, but I'd pushed the idea of dating out of my mind. I don't have time to date. I was on the I-don't-think-I'll-ever-get-married plan. As a business owner my life is the company that I own. It's always been really hard to find someone who appreciates that. But Nick and I are both driven and have a similar goofy sense of humor. It turns out our circles overlapped. We have so many people in common and it was weird. I believe in good timing. If we'd met two months earlier in the same way, it would have been different. Ed Santos and Jill Sciuto were married in March. They were set up by a friend of Ms. Sciuto who had shared an Uber with Mr. Santos. Occupations: Ms. Sciuto is a public relations executive; Mr. Santos is a relationship manager at a corporate bank. How they met: Ms. Sciuto's close friend, Rachel Givens, met Mr. Santos in an Uber on Nov. 27, 2015, driving from Manhattan to Brooklyn. Mr. Santos: I typically don't choose UberPool, but for whatever reason that day I did. It was Thanksgiving weekend 2015. I'd been out with friends in the East Village and at 2 a.m. took an Uber to take me back to Brooklyn. I had a nice conversation with the woman next to me, Rachel. We were talking about relationships, and I told her I was single. She said, I think I have someone for you and I'll put you in touch.

I was a little skeptical, but she showed me a photo and I thought her friend was very attractive. I was interested right away. Jill and I met the next weekend, Dec. 6. It went better than either of us had expected. I really liked her in person, and I wanted to see her again, but we were both going away for Christmas. I felt a certain longing. I was excited to get back to the city to see her. A few weeks into our relationship I took a job assignment in Dallas and we were long distance for a little while. But we made it work. This experience helps me believe that fate is at hand. When I saw the photo and met her in person, my heart and my gut told me something. I really trusted my instincts. This whole thing was happenstance and luck -- but you have to be open enough to see it. Ms. Sciuto: I remember getting a text on a Saturday morning from my friend Rachel: Would you be interested in going out with this guy I met in my UberPool? I said O.K. I think that fate plays a lot in different parts of life. I thought, why not? What have I got to lose? The saying ""One door closes and another one opens,"" has always been in my head throughout various milestones of my life. Ed made me wait a few days before hearing from him -- and I loved that. Not too eager. Our first date was around 2 in the afternoon at the Happiest Hour, a bar in the West Village. We took a walk through the neighborhood, stopping for a drink and something to eat. I got home at 10 that night and called my cousin, my best friend. I told her about all the places we went and what a great personality Ed had. You don't think you're going to meet someone like this. It's a funny, interesting way to find the love of your life. Excerpt from a speech by Rachel Givens at their wedding: Jill and I met in college at Boston University. Always the life of the party, her smile can light up any room, and she is one of my most driven, loyal and fun friends. What always stuck out to me the most was her positive outlook on the future. While she was single in the city, she celebrated it because she knew the right guy would appear one day, and she was confident that she'd just know it when he did.

I got in Uber that night, and we picked up a guy. The very first thing I noticed about him was that he was holding a plate of tacos. All I could do was look down at my pizza and laugh at our stellar choice of late-night snacks. Knowing we were both headed to Brooklyn, I introduced myself and asked him how he liked living there. I told him that my husband and I had lived there only six months, but that we loved it. Without hesitation, he asked if we could all be friends, as he didn't know anyone in the neighborhood. It was so endearing. You don't meet a ton of chatty strangers in New York City willing to laugh at themselves, let alone over their late-night snacking habits. Jill's face immediately popped into my head. Why? Because Jill would be all about chatting in an Uber at 2 a.m., with pizza on her lap, no less. She would have also already asked about where his tacos where from, what level of spice they were, and if she could try them. She loves diving headfirst into conversations with new people, wherever it may be! That was when I asked him if he was single. He was. Would he be interested in meeting an amazing, beautiful friend of mine? He would. For some people, car services like Uber and Via provide more than just transportation. They turn out to be vehicles for meeting their beloved.",4,['4'],4

The Man Who (Almost) Wiped Out the Guinea Worms

N'DJAMENA, Chad -- Dr. Ernesto Ruiz-Tiben's days on the front lines of the guinea-worm wars often end with a dinner of what he calls ""poulet a la bicyclette"" -- chicken so lean and muscular that it could ride in the Tour de France. But before anyone on his team eats, one tradition must be honored. Dr. Ruiz-Tiben raises a beer: ""To the demise of the worm!"" ""To the demise of the worm!"" cry all in attendance, clinking glasses. It is a ritual he has followed for decades, ever since becoming the chief strategist in the war against the Guinea worm run by the Carter Center, the global health philanthropy established in Atlanta by former President Jimmy Carter. [Read about the race to find out how the Guinea worm is attacking African dogs.] At age 78, Dr. Ruiz-Tiben still makes as many as six field trips a year, mostly to what he calls ""places at the end of the road."" Reaching them can mean driving for days in 110-degree heat over kidney-jolting dirt tracks and sleeping in rustic guesthouses where frequent power failures mean sweltering nights passed in oven-hot, bug-filled rooms.

Asked why he does it, Dr. Ruiz-Tiben shrugged. ""Because that's where the action is -- not in the capital city. People want to just snap their fingers and pouf, the worm is gone. That's not going to happen."" In the villages, he asks questions. Where do you get drinking water? What do you eat? How do you cook it? What does your dog eat? How far from home does your dog wander?

Theater,Will the Old Gay Play Have Something New to Say?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/theater/will-the-old-gay-play-have-something-new-to-say.html,"Will the Old Gay Play Have Something New to Say?

Many of us who arrived in New York in the last decades of the last century, looking to the theater for news about what it meant to be gay, found ourselves serially disheartened. Starting with Mart Crowley's ""The Boys in the Band"" in 1968, and continuing with Harvey Fierstein's ""Torch Song Trilogy"" about a dozen years later, we faced quite a fun house mirror of gay life. Or perhaps a house of horrors. ""The Boys in the Band,"" daring in its forthrightness, situated its characters on a Kinsey scale from four to six and a psychological spectrum from damaged to desperate. Arnold Beckoff, the protagonist of ""Torch Song Trilogy,"" could have been one of them. Though sympathetic and sassy, he was still a drag queen in an era that did not valorize that.

In the plague years that followed, the theater naturally reframed gay life in a context of existential danger. Larry Kramer's 1985 AIDS drama ""The Normal Heart"" detonated like an improvised explosive device, but quieter treatments of the disease, like the 1992 musical ""Falsettos,"" hit home, too. And though ""M. Butterfly,"" David Henry Hwang's 1988 play about a French diplomat falling for a Chinese opera singer, cloaked its queerness in innuendo and silk, it was hard not to read it as a cautionary tale of a closet case undone by the mystifications of gender.

Drama is about conflict, not comfort, of course, but what an ambivalent welcome such plays offered ""sensitive"" young men: Out of the closet, into the fire! Even the giddy joy of the 1996 revue ""When Pigs Fly,"" a satire of all things gay and anti-gay, was tempered by the knowledge that Howard Crabtree, its costume designer, co-conceiver and resident genius, died of AIDS two months before it opened. (The composer, Dick Gallagher, died of AIDS in 2005.) I saw all of those shows in their original productions, except ""The Boys in the Band,"" which would have scared me straight at the age of 10. Though the others, which coincided with my 20s and 30s, moved me as general affirmations, their content often felt limiting rather than expansive. True, Arnold Beckoff fulfills his dream of becoming a father, but in 1982, that seemed like a gimmick: something that could happen only onstage. Yet, over the past 20 years, gay rights did expand, well beyond anyone's imagining. (I, too, became a father.) This recently led me to wonder what a young gay man arriving in New York would find if he looked in the mirror of the mainstream theater today.

Pretty much the same thing I did. This past winter, that young man, if he had the money, would have seen the first Broadway revival of ""Falsettos."" This fall, he might catch the first major revivals of ""Torch Song Trilogy"" (starring Michael Urie and Mercedes Ruehl), ""M. Butterfly"" (starring Clive Owen and Jin Ha) and ""When Pigs Fly"" (with costumes by Bob Mackie that pay homage to the outlandish originals). Come spring, he would probably pony up for the 50th-anniversary production of ""The Boys in the Band,"" which Ryan Murphy, who directed the 2014 television movie of ""The Normal Heart,"" plans to produce, with Joe Mantello directing, and Jim Parsons in a starring role. Granted, these revivals are sometimes revisions. ""Torch Song Trilogy"" is no longer even a trilogy -- and has therefore been retitled simply ""Torch Song."" (Moises Kaufman directs.) And Mr. Hwang, working with the director Julie Taymor, has rewritten parts of ""M. Butterfly"" to reflect information that has emerged in recent years about the real-life people the play is based on. Despite these updatings, the fall schedule feels to me like a rewind of my young adulthood in New York, circa 1980 to 1998. Of course, many other gay-themed works arrived in that period, some, like ""Angels in America,"" eternally fresh. (The recent London revival, starring Nathan Lane and Andrew Garfield, begins performances at the Neil Simon Theater on February 22.) But the rest are more like songs on a dusty mixtape found in a bottom drawer. Will they even play? What will they sound like to older -- or younger -- ears? Until this year, I would have guessed they'd sound, well, old. Recent ""gay"" plays have moved past the existential phase (""We are here"") toward second-stage questions of assimilation (""Get used to us"") and beyond. Mr. and Mr. debating fidelity and diapers in CB2 living rooms has almost become passe. Gay men were even beginning to cede the theatrical spotlight to other parts of the L.G.B.T.Q. rainbow, and to intersectional issues of sexuality, gender and race.

Will the Old Gay Play Have Something New to Say?

Many of us who arrived in New York in the last decades of the last century, looking to the theater for news about what it meant to be gay, found ourselves serially disheartened. Starting with Mart Crowley's ""The Boys in the Band"" in 1968, and continuing with Harvey Fierstein's ""Torch Song Trilogy"" about a dozen years later, we faced quite a fun house mirror of gay life. Or perhaps a house of horrors. ""The Boys in the Band,"" daring in its forthrightness, situated its characters on a Kinsey scale from four to six and a psychological spectrum from damaged to desperate. Arnold Beckoff, the protagonist of ""Torch Song Trilogy,"" could have been one of them. Though sympathetic and sassy, he was still a drag queen in an era that did not valorize that.

In the plague years that followed, the theater naturally reframed gay life in a context of existential danger.

Books,Dani Shapiro: By the Book,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/books/review/dani-shapiro-by-the-book.html," What books are on your nightstand? I fall asleep reading every night without fail, so I always have a teetering pile of books on my nightstand to nourish me before I drift off. I keep in mind Jane Kenyon's lovely instruction to writers: ""Have good sentences in your ears."" Late at night it isn't large swaths of narrative I crave, but small gems -- poems, prose that can be read in pieces, the strange, the spiritual, the beautiful. Currently the pile includes the graphic novel ""Are You My Mother?,"" by Alison Bechdel; ""Sum,"" by David Eagleman; ""What the Living Do,"" by Marie Howe; ""A Carnival of Losses: Notes Nearing Ninety,"" by Donald Hall; ""A Path With Heart,"" by Jack Kornfield; and ""Silence: In the Age of Noise,"" by Erling Kagge. Virginia Woolf's ""A Writer's Diary"" is never far from reach either. I dip into it at random, part of a conversation I've been having with Woolf since I began reading her in my 20s. What's the last great book you read? ""Exit West,"" by Mohsin Hamid. I'd like to go back and reread it, in fact. I tore through it the first time as a reader, but I'd also like to study it as a writer, asking the question: ""How did he do that?"" What do you read when you're working on a book? And what kind of reading do you avoid while writing?

It depends on what I'm working on. For my latest memoir, I did a lot of research and reporting, so I was surrounded by stacks of scientific papers and books. I rented an office outside my home because I felt so overwhelmed by those stacks, and didn't want to look at them all day, every day. I also read work that I find inspiring on the level of language. I love writers who take risks, break rules, don't succumb to the censoring voice whispering that it can't be done. When I read courageous work, my own courage grows. Two books I consistently return to for pure encouragement are ""Turn"" and ""Daybook,"" by the artist Anne Truitt, who was also a writer who wrote beautifully about the creative life. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

* Nominate a book: The New York Times Book Review has just turned 125. That got us wondering: What is the best book that was published during that time?
* Listen to our podcast: Featuring conversations with leading figures in the literary world, from Colson Whitehead to Leila Slimani, the Book Review Podcast helps you delve deeper into your favorite books. What's the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently? Maria Popova's forthcoming book ""Figuring"" delves deep into the interconnected lives of several historical figures including Maria Mitchell, America's first professional woman astronomer. Later, as a professor at Vassar, Mitchell tells her students, America's first class of women astronomers: ""Mingle the starlight with your lives and you won't be fretted by trifles."" What moves you most in a work of literature? The capacity to enter the consciousness, the inner life, of another human being. Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid? I read mostly fiction, essays and poetry. I'm drawn to fractured narratives and linked stories, like Joan Silber's ""Ideas of Heaven"" and Jennifer Egan's ""A Visit From the Goon Squad."" I've also been particularly enjoying work that lives in the gray area, directly and transparently mining the writer's autobiographical material in a work of fiction. Two favorite examples of this are Elizabeth Hardwick's ""Sleepless Nights"" and Ruth Ozeki's ""A Tale for the Time Being."" I don't read much science fiction or fantasy. How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or simultaneously? Morning or night?

I wish I could read electronically. It would make my bag a lot lighter! But I find it impossible to read on screens. These days I read several books simultaneously. I take myself to a cafe near my home to read during the day whenever I can. And always, late at night. How do you organize your books? Fifteen years ago, my husband, who is also a writer, and I moved from apartments to an actual house, with an actual library. In fact, the library was what sold us on the house. We alphabetized our thousands of books, and we also organized according to genre: fiction, nonfiction, poetry and literary journals -- back issues of The Paris Review, Grand Street, Tin House, Granta, One Story and Antaeus take up a lot of space, but we have the space. What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves? I've been reading vintage medical books lately, as research into the cultural history of reproductive medicine. For example, Wilfred Finegold's 1964 tome, ""Artificial Insemination."" What's the best book you've ever received as a gift? I don't remember who first gave me Abraham Joshua Heschel's ""The Sabbath."" Nor who gifted it to me the second time, nor the third. I do remember that the third time was the charm, and now I reread Heschel each year as a reminder to slow down, that time is a cathedral. What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most? I was a read-under-the-covers-with-a-flashlight kid. I was an only child, and books were my companions and my salvation. Judy Blume's ""Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret"" was the book that pierced my sense of otherness and made me realize that I wasn't alone or unique in the way I felt about myself and the world. If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be? ""Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus,"" by Mo Willems. It's a children's picture book and doesn't have very many words. You're organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite? Virginia Woolf had a complex, fascinating relationship with Sigmund Freud, who introduced her to the idea of ambivalence, and gave her a narcissus as a gift. I'd like to sit back and watch the two of them go at it, with Leonard as a referee.","The author, most recently, of the memoir ""Inheritance"" turns to family and friends for reading suggestions: ""My 19-year-old son is a voracious reader and constantly recommends books to me.""",a310b70d-2182-5b8f-a97e-c8ab1517faa1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/13/books/review/13ByTheBook/13ByTheBook-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=58ef071ee3481c7af48364e145429e31b2a6d9a77c2b576bafec9ca32b478a55&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Dani Shapiro,a310b70d-2182-5b8f-a97e-c8ab1517faa1,Demo_data/D1_img2/1a310b70d-2182-5b8f-a97e-c8ab1517faa1.jpg,13,"Dani Shapiro: By the Book  What books are on your nightstand?

And what kind of reading do you avoid while writing?

It depends on what I'm working on. For my latest memoir, I did a lot of research and reporting, so I was surrounded by stacks of scientific papers and books. I rented an office outside my home because I felt so overwhelmed by those stacks, and didn't want to look at them all day, every day. I also read work that I find inspiring on the level of language. I love writers who take risks, break rules, don't succumb to the censoring voice whispering that it can't be done. When I read courageous work, my own courage grows. Two books I consistently return to for pure encouragement are ""Turn"" and ""Daybook,"" by the artist Anne Truitt, who was also a writer who wrote beautifully about the creative life.

Health,"Ebola Treatment Using Plasma From Survivors Is Not Effective, Study Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/07/health/ebola-treatment-using-plasma-from-survivors-is-not-effective-study-says.html,"A treatment once considered among the most promising for Ebola patients was not found to be effective in a study performed in Guinea, researchers reported Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine. The experimental treatment involved transfusions of blood plasma collected from Ebola survivors, whose immune systems develop antibodies to neutralize the virus. But the survival rate among the 84 patients in the study who received such transfusions last year was not significantly better than for previous patients who had not received transfusions. Still, the researchers held out some hope for the treatment, known as convalescent plasma. ""We can only say the way plasma was used didn't show the effect we'd hoped for,"" said the study's lead author, Dr. Johan van Griensven, who leads the unit for H.I.V. and neglected tropical diseases at the Antwerp Institute of Tropical Medicine.

The plasma treatment was at one point the top experimental therapy recommended by the World Health Organization for testing during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which has killed more than 11,000 people. Dr. van Griensven said there was still a possibility that the treatment could be effective in certain circumstances. For example, an unusually high proportion of young children and pregnant women who received it during the study survived. However, because only a small number of them were part of the study, conclusions could not be drawn, he said.

It is also possible that only plasma with very high levels of the active antibodies might be effective. The researchers had planned to quantify those levels in a specialized laboratory in France, but samples have yet to be analyzed because it took many months to gain approval to ship them. Another report published Wednesday in the same journal found a survival advantage for Ebola patients in Liberia who received an antimalarial treatment containing the drug amodiaquine. The finding was serendipitous. A Doctors Without Borders treatment center ran out of a standard malaria treatment and for 12 days used the substitute with amodiaquine. (Ebola patients in West Africa were typically given malaria treatment because the disease is so common.) Patients given the substitute drug had a 31 percent lower risk of death once the data were adjusted for other factors that could affect survival. Doctors discovered the effect only months later, when they reviewed patient records after noting that amodiaquine had shown anti-Ebola activity in a laboratory study published in 2013. ""What is interesting here is that we came to this a little bit by chance,"" said Dr. Iza Ciglenecki of Doctors Without Borders in Geneva, who was a co-author. The study cautioned, however, that the survival difference could also have been explained by a negative effect of the standard malaria treatment. Researchers at the United States National Institutes of Health and the United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases are planning to test amodiaquine against Ebola in animals.

Experts not involved in the two papers said the researchers demonstrated the ability to collect important data in an emergency situation. Some had questioned whether Ebola survivors in Guinea would volunteer to participate in the plasma study, noting that the very idea of blood donations from strangers is alien to most people there. ""If somebody gets ill, a family member will come to the center here and donate blood,"" said Dr. Nyankoye Haba, who directs the country's national blood transfusion center and is an author of the study. A major limitation of the plasma study was a lack of randomization. In the most rigorous studies, an experimental treatment is given only to a subset of patients whose outcomes are compared with patients not receiving the therapy. But because plasma was perceived to be so promising, and unlikely to cause harm, the researchers deemed it unacceptable to deprive some patients of the opportunity to receive it. Patients receiving the plasma transfusions were instead compared with those who had previously undergone treatment at the same Doctors Without Borders center. This was problematic because survival rates fluctuated throughout the epidemic, though any causes are not known. Thus, definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of plasma treatment cannot yet be drawn, said Dr. Luciana Borio, the acting chief scientist at the Food and Drug Administration, who was not involved in the study. Dr. Borio wrote in an email that dedicated investigators working with the community had performed ""important clinical research,"" but that the international community now needed to ""further improve the quality of clinical trials done during a public health emergency."" The study itself, which involved a coalition of more than a dozen international and local institutions, is likely to leave a positive effect on Guinea.

When the real Stanford is killed by falling cargo, and their crewmates confuse him for ""the other black guy,"" Abel seizes the opportunity to fake his own death, assume Stanford's identity (they ""actually did look alike"") and begin a new life in America, away from his unhappy marriage and young children back in Kingston.

A more linear family saga might simply explore the impact of Abel's lie on future generations. But ""These Ghosts Are Family,"" Maisy Card's rich, ambitious debut novel, zigzags back and forth in time, between Abel's relatives in Harlem, Jamaica, Brooklyn and Newark. While his actions affect a daughter, Irene, who grows up without her father, they also preverberate, so to speak, for his great-grandmother Louise, a white-passing child in colonial Jamaica who learns her mother was a slave. Instances of false or fuzzy parentage recur up and down the bloodline, stirring questions of identity and origin that have haunted fictional characters from ""The Winter's Tale"" to ""Billie Jean.""

Each character gives Card a fresh opportunity to play with form: Chapters shapeshift here into historical fiction, there into folklore. Collective and second-person narrators feature alongside 19th-century diary entries and court documents recreating Warm Manor, the sugar plantation where Florence, Abel's great-great-grandmother, is brutally enslaved. Card deftly grounds these experiments in subtle details that reveal history's imprint on everyday family life. Like Abel's freckles, light skin and red hair, which show up in his children and ""meant that somewhere in his tree, someone was white,"" so too do legacies of racism, colonialism and misogyny emerge in moments as casual as a domestic joke: When Vincent, Abel's son, marries a white woman descended from slaveowners, he quips that ""maybe God had brought them together so he could avenge his ancestors by getting close enough to wring Debbie's neck."" In Maisy Card's debut novel, ""These Ghosts Are Family,"" a Jamaican immigrant reckons with a decades-old lie in 21st-century Harlem.",13,['13'],13
Style,Where's That Jumpsuit From? It's a Long Story,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/01/style/amah-ayivi-marche-noir.html,"LOME, Togo -- Most of the brick-and-mortar shops in the Grand Marche de Hedzranawoe are shuttered, but plywood boutiques overflow the hallways and plazas that run through its geometric tiled corridors. Velvet dresses, boxer briefs, ties, overalls, wedding dresses and ear muffs hang from exposed beams like curtains on display. One morning in March, Amah Ayivi, a designer and clothing dealer, dug through mounds of utility jumpsuits, his hands bedecked with heavy silver rings. His soft eyes squinted and darted as he systematically sorted through the piles. ""You can go through all of this and only find one, or zero, or 20,"" he said over the rhythmic squeaking horns and the nasal cries of food and drink vendors. Mr. Ayivi said he was looking for ""old-school and vintage and good colors and materials"" that he would later ship to Paris and upsell as vintage under his label Marche Noir.

Much of the clothing comes from charitable donations in wealthy countries. The garments are shipped in colorful containers. Once they arrive, they are sorted, repacked and sold in ever smaller bales. While the imports provide affordable clothing for poor consumers, they have also undermined local textile manufacturing industries. Some countries have tried to control the trade. Last year the East African Community, an intergovernmental organization of six countries in the African Great Lakes region, placed high tariffs on secondhand clothing imports with the intention of banning them by 2019.

Nigeria has long banned secondhand clothing imports. But this has only shifted demand. Used clothing is smuggled into Nigeria, and in Lome, Nigerians dominate the resale industry. Victor Chukwu, a Nigerian who has worked in Togo since 1983, has a boutique in the market and a warehouse nearby packed to the ceiling with sacks of karate uniforms and engineer wear. At the storeroom, Mr. Ayivi covered his mouth with a bandanna to protect from the dust, while Mr. Chukwu's employees clambered atop the piled sacks looking for buried treasures. ""Careful, careful, careful! They are heavy!"" Mr. Chukwu shouted. One sack rolled down the mound, a spare Santa hat poking out the top, and Mr. Chukwu fell back into the sacks, treating them like a giant pillow mound, laughing. ""Fashion is always bringing back the old thing,"" he said.

Marche Noir includes vintage pieces, a selection of African handicrafts and original women's and men's wear designs. For women he selects funky silk dresses and skirts. For men he has a penchant for uniforms: military, work wear and boxy denim, which he sometimes prints with his logo. ""It used to be Marche Noir Paris, now it's Lome-Paris,"" Mr. Ayivi said. ""I changed because as I'm working here a lot, I want to keep the African identity."" Lome is where his business is registered, and it's where the vast majority of his vintage garments come from -- even the French ones. But he makes his money in France.

The clothes he carries back to Europe make visible normally unseen global supply chains, the spidery pathways clothing takes after it is discarded. ""I bring them back to prove, to show that the fashion industry is too much, is going too far,"" he said. Marche Noir's business model feeds on this overproduction. The clothes are cheap where he buys them. The pieces change value as they change context. In Lome, the vintage coveralls he seeks are dated, out of fashion. In Paris, they are modern and stylish. He is preparing another pop-up for Paris Fashion Week in September.

Mr. Ayivi's globally sourced garments reflect a life lived between countries. ""I want to bring this African touch also. For me the African touch is not just about African fabric or African dresses,"" he said. ""In Africa I find a lot of style in the street. The kids in the streets, the women selling fish, they have this touch of style you don't find everywhere. This inspires us."" He calls it ""Afro aestheticism.""

Opinion,"Trump, Unrepentant and Unleashed",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/opinion/sunday/trump-impeachment-trial-witnesses.html,"WASHINGTON -- During a meeting with Donald Trump at Trump Tower in June of 2016, with the opera bouffe builder improbably heading toward the nomination despite a skeletal campaign crew on a floor below, I asked when he would pivot. We all assumed he would have to pivot, that he would have to stop his belittling Twitter rants, that he would have to cease attacking fellow Republicans like John McCain, that he would have to get more in line with the traditional stances of his party, that he would have to be less of a barbarian at the gates of D.C. He crossed his arms, pursed his lips and shook his head -- a child refusing vegetables. How naive he was, I thought to myself. But I was the naive one. Trump has forced the world to pivot to him. The state of the union is upside down and inside out and sauerkraut. Trump has changed literally everything in the last three years, transforming and coarsening the game. On Friday night, he became, arguably, the most brutishly powerful Republican of all time. Never has a leader had such a stranglehold on his party, subsuming it with one gulp.

As the Senate voted 51 to 49 to smother the impeachment inquiry, guided by the dark hand of Mitch McConnell, it felt like the world's greatest deliberative body had been hollowed out, diminished. McConnell let Mitt Romney and Susan Collins vote to allow documents and witnesses such as John Bolton, knowing two could strain at the leash safely. The rest of the senators fell into line as sycophantic clones of Mike Pence. The impeachment trial amounted to one side being earnest and one pretending to be. It was exactly what Nancy Pelosi feared would happen before she was reluctantly drawn into the show trial. ""Now the State of the Union is going to be the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man coming down the street and standing in the rubble of what's left of the Congress,"" keened one Democrat on Friday night. ""The Republican Party has now lost whatever control they could exert over this president, any oversight they could have. It's gone. The state of the union is there is no union. How can there be, when one side is petrified of their Godzilla?"" Senator Chris Murphy, the Connecticut Democrat, dismissed Republicans as ""a cult of personality"" around Trump.

""This trial in so many ways crystallized the completely diametrically opposed threats that Democrats and Republicans see to the country,"" Murphy told The Times's Nicholas Fandos. ""We perceive Donald Trump and his corruption to be an existential threat to the country. They perceive the deep state and the liberal media to be an existential threat to the country. ""That dichotomy, that contrast, has been growing over the last three years, but this trial really crystallized that difference. We were just speaking different languages, fundamentally different languages when it came to what this trial was about. They thought it was about the deep state and the media conspiracy. We thought it was about the president's crimes."" I feel like I have spent my career watching the same depressing dynamic that unspooled Friday night: Democrats trying, sometimes ineptly, to play fair and Republicans ruthlessly trying to win. I watched it with the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings. I watched it in the 2000 recount with Bush versus Gore. I watched it with the push by W., Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld to go to war in Iraq. I watched it with the pantomime of Merrick Garland. Democrats are warning Republicans that they will be judged harshly by history. But in the meantime, the triumphant Republicans get to make history. And a lot of the history that Republicans have made is frightening: the endless, futile wars, the obliviousness to climate change, the stamp on the judiciary. As Carl Hulse writes in his book, ""Confirmation Bias,"" about the Garland fiasco: ""The success in naming judges was the signal achievement of Trump's first two years. In the coming years, those judges will be among the members of the federal bench called to rule on Trump's policies and practices in cases arising from challenges initiated by increasingly confrontational Democrats and other legal adversaries around the nation. Mitch McConnell made a snap decision one night in 2016. The consequences will reverberate for decades."" For hours on Friday, the House managers made their vain final arguments. Pressing for Bolton's testimony, Val Demings implored Republican senators: Aren't you worried that, if left in office, Trump will harm America's national security, seek to corrupt the upcoming election and undermine our democracy to further his own personal gain? Don't you want to hear the witnesses and see the documents that would give the full story and make this a fair trial rather than a mock one?

""This is the American way and this is the American story,"" Demings told the Republican senators as they looked back at her, impassive or impatient. But, of course, they didn't want that. As he voted against witnesses and documents, Lamar Alexander, McConnell's pal, said Trump did something inappropriate but they just did not accept that it was impeachable, and they did not want to tear up ballots and ""pour gasoline on cultural fires that are burning out there."" So why not shut it down and cover it up? The books were cooked from the start. As with so many other pivotal moments in modern history, Republicans wanted to win, not look for the truth.

Technology,Biden Prepares Attack on Facebook's Speech Policies,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/technology/biden-facebook-misinformation.html,"WASHINGTON -- The Biden presidential campaign, emboldened by a recent surge in support, is going after a new target: Facebook. After months of privately battling the tech giant over President Trump's free rein on its social network, the campaign will begin urging its millions of supporters to demand that Facebook strengthen its rules against misinformation and to hold politicians accountable for harmful comments. On Thursday, the campaign will circulate a petition and an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, to change the company's hands-off approach to political speech. The petition will be sent to millions of supporters on its email and text message lists and through social media, including Facebook, imploring them to sign the letter. The campaign will also release a video this week to be shared across social media to explain the issue. ""Real changes to Facebook's policies for their platform and how they enforce them are necessary to protect against a repeat of the role that disinformation played in the 2016 election and that continues to threaten our democracy today,"" said Bill Russo, a spokesman for the Biden campaign.

The move puts the Biden camp in the center of a raging debate about the role and responsibility of tech platforms. Civil rights leaders, Democratic lawmakers and many of Facebook's own employees say that big tech companies have a responsibility to prevent false and hateful information from being shared widely. But conservatives, including Mr. Trump, accuse social media companies that have tightened their speech policies, like Twitter and Snap, of political bias. Two weeks ago, after Twitter attached fact-checking notices to two of the president's tweets that made false claims about voter fraud, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that would make it easier for federal regulators to argue that the companies are suppressing free speech. The Biden team's offensive also intensifies pressure on Facebook, which faced a public backlash last week after it did nothing about inflammatory posts by Mr. Trump. Employees resigned, hundreds participated in a virtual walkout, advertisers canceled their accounts, and nonprofits in Washington ceased sponsorships from the company. The criticism poses one of most serious challenges to the leadership of Mr. Zuckerberg since he helped start the company 15 years ago. But faced with opposition in the past, the 36-year-old's instinct has been to dig in his heels. Mr. Zuckerberg feels strongly that his platform should be neutral and believes the debate on speech is about preserving a diversity of ideas, even if those ideas are false or harmful.

""This week, the Democratic candidate for president started a petition calling on us to do the exact opposite. Just as they have done with broadcast networks -- where the U.S. government prohibits rejecting politicians' campaign ads -- the people's elected representatives should set the rules, and we will follow them. There is an election coming in November and we will protect political speech, even when we strongly disagree with it."" Tim Murtaugh, the director of communications for Mr. Trump's campaign, said, ""The American people can think for themselves. They don't want big tech companies telling them how to think."" Joe Biden has been buoyed in recent weeks by new financial and online support. His campaign has had a surge in fund-raising, and it has collected 1.2 million more email signatures in the past seven days. Numerous political polls have shown him gaining ground on Mr. Trump. Even though he plans to attack Facebook, Mr. Biden is increasingly turning to the site to reach voters with ads. In recent days, he spent $5 million in advertising on Facebook, surging past political ad spending by Mr. Trump, who has dominated Facebook throughout the campaign season. ""Biden is doing the right thing by pushing the platform to be more ethical and by not walking away from it, which is not realistic,"" said Erik Smith, a former Democratic strategist and co-founder of Seven Letter, a crisis communications firm. ""But he's running a race against an opponent who has a 10-mile head start on Facebook."" The open letter being sent on Thursday will say that ""Trump and his allies have used Facebook to spread fear and misleading information about voting, attempting to compromise the means of holding power to account: our voices and our ballot boxes.""

It calls on the company to take several steps to limit misinformation and hateful language on the site, including making clear rules ""that prohibit threatening behavior and lies about how to participate in the election."" The video criticizing Facebook will be narrated by Mr. Biden's deputy campaign director, Kate Bedingfield. It will warn that Facebook's inaction toward Mr. Trump threatens the election and puts Americans in harm's way. The goal is to publicly pressure Facebook's leadership to restrict misinformation by politicians and to fact-check political ads ahead of the November election. The tensions between the Biden campaign and Facebook began last October, in the heat of Mr. Trump's impeachment battle. The Trump campaign released ads on Facebook that falsely claimed that Mr. Biden offered to bribe Ukrainian officials to drop an investigation into his son. The claims in the video ads were not substantiated, and television networks, including CNN, declined to run the ads. The campaign complained to Facebook and demanded that the videos, which were viewed and shared millions of times, be removed. But the company said the videos didn't clearly violate its policies against misinformation and that comments by politicians and their campaigns, even if false, were newsworthy and important for public discourse. Mr. Zuckerberg later that month defended that decision in a speech at Georgetown University, arguing that he believed political speech did not need to be fact-checked or moderated by the company because comments by political figures were deeply scrutinized by the public. In January, in an interview with The New York Times's editorial board, Mr. Biden criticized Mr. Zuckerberg personally. ""I've never been a big Zuckerberg fan,"" Mr. Biden said. ""I think he's a real problem."" Mr. Biden also called for the end of the legal shield Mr. Trump targeted recently in his executive order. The vice president said Facebook's inaction demonstrated the need to revoke the law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields them from most liability for the content they host.

Behind the scenes, the campaign had continued to negotiate with top Facebook executives and lobbyists, according to letters obtained by The Times. In April, senior campaign officials wrote Brian Rice, the top Democratic lobbyist for Facebook, with proposals to improve fact-checking ahead of the election. The campaign called for Facebook to fact check new political ads two weeks ahead of the Nov. 3 election, and to restrict campaigns and candidates from sharing content already deemed false by third-party fact checkers. On May 26, the campaign manager, Jen O'Malley Dillon, wrote a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg to again push for changes to political speech policies and noted that often content by super PACs is checked only days after it has been posted and gone viral, even though it contains misinformation. Mr. Zuckerberg didn't respond, though Facebook did. The campaign decided to take its fight public after Mr. Trump's posts in recent days. He falsely claimed that mail-in ballots would lead to voter fraud. And his warning that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" startled people on the campaign. ""You seem to carve out an exception for Donald Trump that permits him to abuse your platform because he is the president,"" Ms. Dillon wrote in a separate letter on June 5 to Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global policy and communications. ""But it is surely clear that precisely because Donald Trump is the president, these abuses take on major significance.""",The campaign will urge its supporters to push the social media giant to strengthen its rules against misinformation and harmful comments.,63b7175a-80eb-52b8-801d-d412e9494d52,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/11/business/11biden-facebook/merlin_173112174_cfd24a9d-7896-447a-bfc7-cada1e29ff57-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=6facebe5391fec5821b4a7d0b4ec68e6de8b95419f64dcce557ca708b63f7499&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"On Thursday, the Joe Biden campaign will circulate a petition and an open letter to Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief, to change the company's hands-off approach to political speech.",63b7175a-80eb-52b8-801d-d412e9494d52,Demo_data/D1_img2/163b7175a-80eb-52b8-801d-d412e9494d52.jpg,20,"Biden Prepares Attack on Facebook's Speech Policies WASHINGTON -- The Biden presidential campaign, emboldened by a recent surge in support, is going after a new target: Facebook.

Science,"Naomi Oreskes, a Lightning Rod in a Changing Climate",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/science/naomi-oreskes-a-lightning-rod-in-a-changing-climate.html,"The job interviewer scrutinized the young American geology student sitting across from him. She was about to graduate from the Royal School of Mines in London, and was trying to break into a field long unwelcoming to women. What, he wanted to know, might she have to contribute to the geology of mining? Naomi Oreskes had a simple answer: ""I want to find an ore deposit!"" She wound up in the Australian outback in the early 1980s -- not to search for deposits, exactly, but to help work out the complex geology of one that had just been found. It would eventually become one of the world's largest uranium mines. Yet, in time, prospecting for ores could not hold her interest. Today, from a professorship at Harvard University, Dr. Oreskes is still in the mining business. But rather than digging for minerals, she tunnels into historical archives, and she is still finding radioactive nuggets.

Dr. Oreskes is fast becoming one of the biggest names in climate science -- not as a climatologist, but as a defender who uses the tools of historical scholarship to counter what she sees as ideologically motivated attacks on the field. Formally, she is a historian of science. Informally, this diminutive woman has become a boxer, throwing herself into a messy public arena that many career-minded climate scientists try to avoid. She helps raise money to defend researchers targeted for criticism by climate change denialists. She has become a heroine to activist college students, supporting their demand that universities and other institutions divest from fossil fuels. Climatologists, though often reluctant themselves to get into fights, have showered her with praise for being willing to do it.

Dr. Oreskes's approach has been to dig deeply into the history of climate change denial, documenting its links to other episodes in which critics challenged a developing scientific consensus. Her core discovery, made with a co-author, Erik M. Conway, was twofold. They reported that dubious tactics had been used over decades to cast doubt on scientific findings relating to subjects like acid rain, the ozone shield, tobacco smoke and climate change. And most surprisingly, in each case, the tactics were employed by the same group of people. The central players were serious scientists who had major career triumphs during the Cold War, but in subsequent years apparently came to equate environmentalism with socialism, and government regulation with tyranny. In a 2010 book, Dr. Oreskes and Dr. Conway called these men ""Merchants of Doubt,"" and this spring the book became a documentary film, by Robert Kenner. At the heart of both works is a description of methods that were honed by the tobacco industry in the 1960s and have since been employed to cast doubt on just about any science being cited to support new government regulations.

Who is the woman at the center of this whirlwind? Born in 1958, Dr. Oreskes grew up in Manhattan, displaying keen musical abilities as well as an interest in following her father into scientific research. A high-school and college boyfriend, Jonathan Pershing, recalled watching her practice a piece of piano music endlessly until she nailed it. ""She has always been incredibly intense,"" he said. She started at Brown University, but finished her undergraduate geology degree abroad, at the storied Royal School of Mines. A former faculty member, Richard H. Sibson, said the British educational system at the time was characterized by ""benign neglect"" of students, but he grew fond of watching this brash young American solicit a good education. ""She reminded me of Lucy in the Peanuts cartoon, stalking the corridors with a metaphorical softball bat on her shoulders, looking for faculty to slug if she thought we weren't doing our jobs,"" Dr. Sibson said. After graduating with high honors, she won a job in 1981 as a young field geologist for Western Mining, an Australian company developing a site called Olympic Dam. The geology there was so complex that after three years she decided to return to the United States to pursue a doctoral degree at Stanford University as a way to better understand it. But she felt a growing desire to plunge into more fundamental questions about the nature and history of science. She established her career as a historian with a book-length study examining the role of dissent in the scientific method. As she put it a few months ago to an audience at Indiana University, she wanted to wrestle with this question: ""How do you distinguish a maverick from a crank?""

Dr. Oreskes found that Wegener had been treated badly, particularly by American geologists. But he did not abandon his faith in the scientific method. He kept publishing until his death in 1930, trying to convince fellow scientists of his position, and was finally vindicated three decades later by oceanographic research conducted during the Cold War. As she completed that study, Dr. Oreskes sought to understand how science was affected not only by the Cold War but by its end. In particular, she started wondering about climate science. Global warming had seemed to rise as an important issue around the time the Iron Curtain came down. Was this just a way for scientists to scare up research money that would no longer be coming their way through military channels? By the early 2000s, she and her husband, Kenneth Belitz, had two daughters, and she had taken a permanent faculty position at San Diego, where she would stay until Harvard recruited her in 2013. At the time, the widespread public impression was that scientists were still divided over whether humans were primarily responsible for the warming of the planet. But how sharp was the split, she wondered? She decided to do something no climate scientist had thought to do: count the published scientific papers. Pulling 928 of them, she was startled to find that not one dissented from the basic findings that warming was underway and human activity was the main reason.

She published that finding in a short paper in the journal Science in 2004, and the reaction was electric. Advocates of climate action seized on it as proof of a level of scientific consensus that most of them had not fully perceived. Just as suddenly, Dr. Oreskes found herself under political attack. Some of the voices criticizing her -- scientists like Dr. Singer and groups like the George C. Marshall Institute in Washington -- were barely known to her at the time, Dr. Oreskes said in an interview. Just who were they? A scene from the documentary ""Merchants of Doubt."" She had connected by then with Dr. Conway, an official NASA historian who, working on his own time, helped her dig into some important archives. It did not take them long to document that this group, which included prominent Cold War scientists, had been attacking environmental research for decades, challenging the science of the ozone layer and acid rain, even the finding that breathing secondhand tobacco smoke was harmful. Trying to undermine climate science was simply the latest project. Dr. Oreskes and Dr. Conway came to believe that the attacks were patterned on the strategy employed by the tobacco industry when evidence of health risks first emerged. Documents pried loose by lawyers showed that the industry had paid certain scientists to contrive dubious research, had intimidated reputable scientists, and had cherry-picked evidence to present a misleading picture. The tobacco industry had used these tactics in defense of profits. But Dr. Oreskes and Dr. Conway wrote that the so-called merchants of doubt had adopted them for a deep ideological reason: contempt for government regulation. The insight gave climate scientists a new way of understanding the politics that had engulfed their field. Following Dr. Oreskes's cue, researchers have in recent years developed a cottage industry of counting scientific papers and polling scientists. The results typically show that about 97 percent of working climate scientists accept that global warming is happening, that humans are largely responsible, and that the situation poses long-term risks, though the severity of those risks is not entirely clear. That wave of evidence has prompted many national news organizations to stop portraying the field as split evenly between scientists who are convinced and unconvinced.

The themes in ""Merchants of Doubt"" have hardly gone unchallenged, though, and the protests have not always originated on the far right. A vigorous objection has come from the family of William A. Nierenberg, one of the scientists singled out for criticism in the book. Dr. Oreskes and Dr. Conway accused Dr. Nierenberg of weakening two major scientific reports that he led in the early 1980s, one on acid rain and one on global warming. Dr. Nierenberg died in 2000, but his son, daughter and son-in-law have compiled a detailed critique contending that the historians misrepresented Dr. Nierenberg's activities. ""If you read her writing on the subjects I am familiar with, you know less about the topic than before you started,"" Nicolas Nierenberg said in an interview. A former staff officer at the National Research Council who helped oversee the preparation of the global warming report, John S. Perry, also said he felt that Dr. Oreskes had been unfair to Dr. Nierenberg. ""That sort of bothers me, because her book 'Merchants of Doubt' is otherwise so good,'"" he said in an interview, adding that in his view the 1983 climate report stands up to scrutiny even in hindsight. The cover of Dr. Oreskes's recent book, with Erik M. Conway, ""The Collapse of Western Civilization."" Dr. Oreskes has disputed the specific complaints raised by the Nierenberg siblings, but she did say in an interview that she somewhat regretted the tone of one article on Dr. Nierenberg -- a paper that compared him to Dr. Pangloss, the character in Voltaire's ""Candide"" who is optimistic about the future to the point of delusion. ""I concede that the tone was somewhat aggressive,"" Dr. Oreskes said. ""We were still working out the argument at the time. But we stand by every fact in that paper."" Dr. Oreskes's critics have taken delight in searching out errors in her books and other writings, prompting her to post several corrections. They have generally been minor, though, like describing a pH of six as neutral, when the correct number is seven. Dr. Oreskes described that as a typographical error.

In the leaked emails, Dr. Singer told a group of his fellow climate change denialists that he felt that Dr. Oreskes and Dr. Conway had libeled him. But in an interview, when pressed for specific errors in the book that might constitute libel, he listed none. Nor did he provide such a list in response to a follow-up email request. He said he had consulted with lawyers about suing Dr. Oreskes, but had ruled it out. ""I decided it was too expensive and too time-consuming,"" Dr. Singer said. ""She could probably outspend me. She's made an awful lot of money out of this book and out of her lectures."" Informed of this remark, Dr. Oreskes laughed aloud. ""If I had wanted to make money, I would have stayed in the mining business,"" she said. However much she might be hated by climate change denialists, Dr. Oreskes is often welcomed on college campuses these days. She usually outlines the decades of research supporting the idea that human emissions pose serious risks. ""One of the things that should always be asked about scientific evidence is, how old is it?"" Dr. Oreskes said. ""It's like wine. If the science about climate change were only a few years old, I'd be a skeptic, too."" Dr. Oreskes and Dr. Conway keep looking for ways to reach new audiences. Last year, they published a short work of science fiction, written as a historical essay from the distant future. ""The Collapse of Western Civilization: A View From the Future"" argues that conservatives, by fighting sensible action to cope with the climate crisis, are essentially guaranteeing the long-term outcome they fear, a huge expansion of government. The far right is unpersuaded, of course. People pushing climate denial on the Internet regularly issue new attacks on Dr. Oreskes, who is no longer surprised by them. ""Most people would think it's a bad thing to be a lightning rod, and I cannot say I enjoy it,"" she said.

She was about to graduate from the Royal School of Mines in London, and was trying to break into a field long unwelcoming to women. What, he wanted to know, might she have to contribute to the geology of mining? Naomi Oreskes had a simple answer: ""I want to find an ore deposit!"" She wound up in the Australian outback in the early 1980s -- not to search for deposits, exactly, but to help work out the complex geology of one that had just been found. It would eventually become one of the world's largest uranium mines. Yet, in time, prospecting for ores could not hold her interest. Today, from a professorship at Harvard University, Dr. Oreskes is still in the mining business. But rather than digging for minerals, she tunnels into historical archives, and she is still finding radioactive nuggets.

Dr. Oreskes is fast becoming one of the biggest names in climate science -- not as a climatologist, but as a defender who uses the tools of historical scholarship to counter what she sees as ideologically motivated attacks on the field. Formally, she is a historian of science. Informally, this diminutive woman has become a boxer, throwing herself into a messy public arena that many career-minded climate scientists try to avoid. She helps raise money to defend researchers targeted for criticism by climate change denialists. She has become a heroine to activist college students, supporting their demand that universities and other institutions divest from fossil fuels. Climatologists, though often reluctant themselves to get into fights, have showered her with praise for being willing to do it.

Dr. Oreskes's approach has been to dig deeply into the history of climate change denial, documenting its links to other episodes in which critics challenged a developing scientific consensus. Her core discovery, made with a co-author, Erik M. Conway, was twofold. They reported that dubious tactics had been used over decades to cast doubt on scientific findings relating to subjects like acid rain, the ozone shield, tobacco smoke and climate change. And most surprisingly, in each case, the tactics were employed by the same group of people. The central players were serious scientists who had major career triumphs during the Cold War, but in subsequent years apparently came to equate environmentalism with socialism, and government regulation with tyranny. In a 2010 book, Dr. Oreskes and Dr. Conway called these men ""Merchants of Doubt,"" and this spring the book became a documentary film, by Robert Kenner. At the heart of both works is a description of methods that were honed by the tobacco industry in the 1960s and have since been employed to cast doubt on just about any science being cited to support new government regulations.

Who is the woman at the center of this whirlwind? Born in 1958, Dr. Oreskes grew up in Manhattan, displaying keen musical abilities as well as an interest in following her father into scientific research. A high-school and college boyfriend, Jonathan Pershing, recalled watching her practice a piece of piano music endlessly until she nailed it. ""She has always been incredibly intense,"" he said. She started at Brown University, but finished her undergraduate geology degree abroad, at the storied Royal School of Mines. A former faculty member, Richard H. Sibson, said the British educational system at the time was characterized by ""benign neglect"" of students, but he grew fond of watching this brash young American solicit a good education. ""She reminded me of Lucy in the Peanuts cartoon, stalking the corridors with a metaphorical softball bat on her shoulders, looking for faculty to slug if she thought we weren't doing our jobs,"" Dr. Sibson said. After graduating with high honors, she won a job in 1981 as a young field geologist for Western Mining, an Australian company developing a site called Olympic Dam. The geology there was so complex that after three years she decided to return to the United States to pursue a doctoral degree at Stanford University as a way to better understand it. But she felt a growing desire to plunge into more fundamental questions about the nature and history of science. She established her career as a historian with a book-length study examining the role of dissent in the scientific method. As she put it a few months ago to an audience at Indiana University, she wanted to wrestle with this question: ""How do you distinguish a maverick from a crank?""

Dr. Oreskes found that Wegener had been treated badly, particularly by American geologists. But he did not abandon his faith in the scientific method. He kept publishing until his death in 1930, trying to convince fellow scientists of his position, and was finally vindicated three decades later by oceanographic research conducted during the Cold War. As she completed that study, Dr. Oreskes sought to understand how science was affected not only by the Cold War but by its end. In particular, she started wondering about climate science. Global warming had seemed to rise as an important issue around the time the Iron Curtain came down.

Art & Design,His and Hers Collecting: She Prefers Art That's 'in Your Face',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/arts/design/show-us-your-wall-billy-jennifer-frist.html,"His and Hers Collecting: She Prefers Art That's 'in Your Face'

NASHVILLE -- It would be easier to list the famous photographers that Billy and Jennifer Frist don't collect. Lining the walls of their hilltop home, once featured in Architectural Digest, are images by dozens of the greatest practitioners of the genre (Diane Arbus, William Eggleston, Berenice Abbott, Sally Mann). Name one that pops to mind; it's here (Edward Weston, William Christenberry, Paul Strand). But so are many works by local artists who don't have wider fame. Even though they own more than a thousand photographs that range widely in era, subject and style, the Frists don't emphasize numbers, in either scope or value. ""We're not looking to impress,"" said Mr. Frist, 48, an investor who was once an art history major at Princeton. ""If you walk away impressed, great, but we're not building a collection for that.""

Ms. Frist, 47, added, ""We buy what we like, and what we want to look at every day."" The Frist name carries a lot of weight, both locally and nationally. Mr. Frist's father, Thomas F. Frist Jr., co-founded HCA Healthcare as well as the Frist Art Museum in Nashville, where the younger Mr. Frist is now chairman of the board of trustees. Billy Frist's paternal uncle, Bill Frist, is a former United States senator and majority leader from Tennessee.

The Frists' own mini-museum at home is loosely organized by genre. ""So we have high-fashion upstairs, and we have the Southern things downstairs,"" Ms. Frist said, adding that she called the former images -- by the likes of Richard Avedon, Irving Penn, Sante d'Orazio, Annie Leibovitz and David LaChapelle -- ""Billy's girls."" They both call their collecting a ""hobby,"" but it's a serious one. The holdings range from some 40 works by the Nashville-based photographer Jack Spencer to an 1840s daguerreotype depicting New York City that they purchased for $62,500 at Sotheby's in 2009. The Frists even have a dedicated photography storage room, with flat files and pairs of white gloves for proper handling.

NASHVILLE -- It would be easier to list the famous photographers that Billy and Jennifer Frist don't collect. Lining the walls of their hilltop home, once featured in Architectural Digest, are images by dozens of the greatest practitioners of the genre (Diane Arbus, William Eggleston, Berenice Abbott, Sally Mann). Name one that pops to mind; it's here (Edward Weston, William Christenberry, Paul Strand). But so are many works by local artists who don't have wider fame. Even though they own more than a thousand photographs that range widely in era, subject and style, the Frists don't emphasize numbers, in either scope or value. ""We're not looking to impress,"" said Mr. Frist, 48, an investor who was once an art history major at Princeton. ""If you walk away impressed, great, but we're not building a collection for that.""

Ms. Frist, 47, added, ""We buy what we like, and what we want to look at every day."" The Frist name carries a lot of weight, both locally and nationally. Mr. Frist's father, Thomas F. Frist Jr., co-founded HCA Healthcare as well as the Frist Art Museum in Nashville, where the younger Mr. Frist is now chairman of the board of trustees. Billy Frist's paternal uncle, Bill Frist, is a former United States senator and majority leader from Tennessee.

The Frists' own mini-museum at home is loosely organized by genre. ""So we have high-fashion upstairs, and we have the Southern things downstairs,"" Ms. Frist said, adding that she called the former images -- by the likes of Richard Avedon, Irving Penn, Sante d'Orazio, Annie Leibovitz and David LaChapelle -- ""Billy's girls."" They both call their collecting a ""hobby,"" but it's a serious one. The holdings range from some 40 works by the Nashville-based photographer Jack Spencer to an 1840s daguerreotype depicting New York City that they purchased for $62,500 at Sotheby's in 2009. The Frists even have a dedicated photography storage room, with flat files and pairs of white gloves for proper handling.

Movies,Sophia Loren Makes Her Return to Film: 'I'm a Perfectionist',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/13/movies/sophia-loren-the-life-ahead-netflix.html,"The question is prompted by ""The Life Ahead,"" the Netflix drama premiering Friday and starring the Italian great who once practically defined international glamour. As it happens, her first feature since a TV movie 10 years ago combines her passion for film with the other great passion of her life, her family. Loren, now 86, has long prioritized them over her acting career, but with the new drama, she combines both loves: The movie's co-writer and director is Edoardo Ponti, the younger of her two sons. In ""The Life Ahead,"" Loren's third collaboration with Ponti, she plays an Italian Holocaust survivor known as Madame Rosa who takes in and eventually bonds with a Senegalese orphan, Momo (Ibrahima Gueye).

In a phone interview from her home in Geneva, Loren spoke about aging gracefully, taking direction from her son and some of her favorite roles. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. You started making fewer movies by 1980, seven years after the birth of Edoardo and 12 years after the birth of Carlo Jr., his brother. Why did you slow down? At the time, I asked myself, ""What do you want from life, Sophia?"" I said, ""I want a nice family,"" which I had. ""I want two children,"" which I had. ""But I never see them."" So I said to myself, ""From now on, maybe I will slow down a little bit."" But I didn't slow down just a little bit: I was simply not working anymore. Not because I didn't love working; I wanted to know more about my family, because I was often living at the studio. I really surprised myself by saying, ""Sophia, it's better that you stop acting for now, and catch up later."" I stopped making films for a long time but was very happy because I saw my children grow up, get married and have their own children. [Carlo Ponti, her husband of 50 years, died in 2007.] What kind of scripts are you sent now? I still get sent many scripts, but none spoke to me like ""The Life Ahead"" did. That's why I didn't work for almost 10 years. I wanted to find a role that really inspired and challenged me. Madame Rosa was that character, not only for her different and sometimes opposing emotions, but also for the message of tolerance, love and inclusion that the film expresses. You sometimes describe yourself as a ""perfectionist,"" and since ""The Life Ahead"" is your third collaboration with Edoardo: Has it gotten easier to take direction from your son?

I'm a perfectionist, but so is he. Edoardo gives me security. He also never gives up until I give him my very best. He doesn't settle for anything less than that, and he knows exactly what buttons to push to get something out of me. When Edoardo says ""This is it"" after we film a scene, I know that my performance is exactly what he was waiting for. That's a wonderful feeling for an actress, because you are sure of what you're doing. What have directors like Vittorio De Sica taught you? De Sica taught me to be true to myself and follow my instincts, not a trend. Easier said than done, but that's important. I was 17 years old when I met De Sica. [She would work with him later in ""The Gold of Naples,"" 1954, the first of several collaborations.] To meet De Sica -- he was a saint to me, the biggest director in the world. And he wanted to see me: ""Ah, you are from Naples. I have something for you."" That's how my film career started, with Vittorio De Sica. How important has it been for you to work with filmmakers that you have a personal connection with, either in real life or from watching their films? Well, that was not possible when I started making movies in America. Working with great American actors was a great school for me, but it was also a totally foreign experience. I worked with Cary Grant and Frank Sinatra [on ""The Pride and the Passion,"" 1957] when I was 22, still a kid. At the time, I saw the possibilities that came with working in English, even rotten English, because it was not my language. But the sound of talking and music is very dear to me, and I learned English right away. I had a wonderful time when I first made American films. I did ""Desire Under the Elms,"" ""Houseboat"" -- I don't remember them all. A role has to feel personal, because you do your best when you feel the role in your bones.

In your memoir, ""Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow,"" you describe your acting career as a ""remarkable season of Italian cinema that I had the privilege and the honor to experience firsthand."" Do contemporary Italian movies and filmmakers not interest you as much? I don't watch many films or series anymore, but I must say that the work of Matteo Garrone and Paolo Sorrentino is a pleasure to watch, and they both happen to be Neapolitan! You did some voice acting in 2011, playing the voice of Mama Topolino for the Italian dub of ""Cars 2."" What was that like? I hadn't seen many animated films, so I didn't know what to expect from that role, but I must say that ""Cars 2"" is one of my grandchildren's favorite films.

Is aging gracefully a conscious concern for you? If you accept the aging process and live in the present, then you age gracefully. You've said that you greatly admire Daniel Day-Lewis, whom you starred with in ""Nine."" Now that he has retired, who are your favorite contemporary actors or actresses? I still like him a lot, regardless of if he works again or not! He is a great actor and always admirable. I also love Meryl Streep! She is a great actress. What advice would you give a young actress? There is nothing that you can say. If you decide that you have to be an actress, because it's something that you love, then you have to do what your mind teaches you, to put yourself in a situation where you only think about your life as an actress. Then you'll see if you do or don't get married. Life is not just one thing; it's so many things, and sometimes so many things all together. Do you rewatch your movies? I tend to judge myself very harshly, so it's best that I don't watch my films straight away. Sometimes I do, out of curiosity, if one of my films is on TV, or maybe with my children, because maybe they haven't seen films that I made a long time ago. And sometimes, so many years have passed that watching myself is like discovering a whole different person. That's an interesting experience. I like it. Are there performances that you're especially proud of? My role in ""Two Women"" means a great deal to me [she won an Oscar in 1962 for this De Sica film in which she played a struggling single mother during World War II], but also the role I played in ""A Special Day"" [as a homemaker who becomes more compassionate after she learns that her neighbor is gay]. It all depends on the story, and on the perfection of great directors like De Sica. I loved working with him, as well as the films I made with Marcello Mastroianni. Do you want to continue acting? If I like acting, why should I stop?","The star, now 86, was looking for a personal connection to a script.

Technology,The Week in Tech: Huge Fines Can't Hide America's Lack of a Data Privacy Law,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/technology/facebook-data-privacy.html,"Each week, we review the week's news, offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Hi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at this past week's tech news: You'd be forgiven for thinking that a government agency tossing out fines of billions of dollars was being pretty aggressive. But you might be wrong. This week, the Federal Trade Commission announced that Facebook had agreed to pay a $5 billion fine, and accept increased oversight, as a result of an investigation into its mishandling of user data. It also announced that the credit bureau Equifax would pay at least $650 million to cover consumer costs resulting from the 2017 data breach. That all sounds like punishment. But some people think it's not enough. Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, for instance, had previously said of the Facebook settlement that it did not ""put in place reasonable guardrails to ensure that user privacy and data are protected"" in the future.

Perhaps most galling to Facebook, the government investigation is being aided by one of Mark Zuckberg's earliest collaborators. In recent weeks, Chris Hughes, who started working with Mr. Zuckerberg on Facebook in a Harvard dorm room, has joined two leading antitrust academics in meetings with the F.T.C., the Justice Department and state attorneys general. Sure, the F.T.C. lacks muscle. Even if it wanted to be firmer -- which it did, according to a Washington Post report, by holding Mr. Zuckerberg accountable and issuing a large fine -- it can't always follow through. (Which is reportedly what happened here, as it crumbled to Facebook's lawyers, who threatened to ""cease settlement talks and send the matter to court"" -- something the agency is said to have shied away from.) But the agency is also limited in what it can do, and while it has asked for its powers to be expanded, that's yet to happen. Meanwhile, Joseph J. Simons, who leads the commission, has said that a lack of consumer privacy law makes it hard to prove to a court that someone has been harmed by misuses or loss of their data, and that the passing of one would provide incentive to companies to behave better in the first place. Here could be the guardrails that Mr. Warner would like -- which might be why he said that ""it's time for Congress to act"" on the F.T.C.'s inability to clamp down more firmly on Facebook. The idea of a privacy law is not new, and there is strong support on both sides of the aisle in Washington: There are at least a dozen proposals for such a thing. But they have floundered. ""We've been talking for what, two years about a privacy bill?"" said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana, earlier this month. ""Haven't seen one, don't know if we'll ever see one.""

Beyond the usual issues of gridlock and partisanship, the question of whether or not a federal law should overrule state rules has also been a sticking point. California's privacy law, which is scheduled take effect on Jan. 1 and protects user data from unauthorized access, theft or disclosure, is viewed as particularly stringent, with potentially large fines for violations. Some lawmakers think that goes too far, which feeds the stalemate. Lawyers aren't holding their breath for a decision in Washington. ""Are we going to have a federal solution in a year? I would say no,"" said Robert Cattanach, a partner at the law firm Dorsey & Whitney and a former trial lawyer for the Department of Justice. But other states appear to be ready to follow California, with at least 25 having introduced some form of privacy bill this year. As they bubble up, there may be ""enough pain exacted"" that there is little choice but for Congress to introduce a single federal standard, Mr. Cattanach said. The Department of Justice finally announced on Tuesday that it was investigating tech antitrust concerns. It didn't name specific companies, but will look into search, social media and some retail services -- so, no prizes for guessing that Google, Facebook and Amazon are clearly in its sights.

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here. Hi, I'm Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here's a look at this past week's tech news: You'd be forgiven for thinking that a government agency tossing out fines of billions of dollars was being pretty aggressive. But you might be wrong. This week, the Federal Trade Commission announced that Facebook had agreed to pay a $5 billion fine, and accept increased oversight, as a result of an investigation into its mishandling of user data. It also announced that the credit bureau Equifax would pay at least $650 million to cover consumer costs resulting from the 2017 data breach. That all sounds like punishment. But some people think it's not enough. Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, for instance, had previously said of the Facebook settlement that it did not ""put in place reasonable guardrails to ensure that user privacy and data are protected"" in the future.

Perhaps most galling to Facebook, the government investigation is being aided by one of Mark Zuckberg's earliest collaborators.

Books,A Work by Zora Neale Hurston Will Finally Be Published,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/books/zora-neale-hurston-new-book.html,"In 1931, publishers were unimpressed with Zora Neale Hurston's ""Barracoon."" One offered to buy it if she rewrote it ""in language rather than dialect."" Hurston refused, and the book was never published until now.

In the spring of 1931, Zora Neale Hurston finished her first book, a 117-page manuscript titled ""Barracoon."" It told the true story of Cudjo Lewis, an Alabama man who was believed to be the last living person captured in Africa and brought to America on a slave ship. Publishers were unimpressed. One offered to buy it if she rewrote it ""in language rather than dialect,"" Hurston wrote in a letter to one of her benefactors. She refused, and ""Barracoon"" was never published. But Hurston kept thinking about Lewis, whose story felt deeply personal to her. About a decade later, she wrote about him in ""Dust Tracks on a Road,"" her autobiography: ""After 75 years, he still had that tragic sense of loss. That yearning for blood and cultural ties. That sense of mutilation. It gave me something to feel about.""

Now, nearly a century after she wrote it, ""Barracoon"" will be made widely available to the public for the first time, in a new edition published by Amistad, a HarperCollins's imprint. The book's release could have a profound impact on Hurston's literary legacy. Hurston, who died in 1960, is best known for her works of fiction, including ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" and ""Moses, Man of the Mountain."" But she was also a groundbreaking anthropologist and ethnographer, one of the first in her field to record and study African-American folklore, at a time when most scholars ignored black culture, or dismissed it as primitive.

""This is going to make us look at her again as a social scientist,"" said the scholar Deborah G. Plant, who wrote an introduction to ""Barracoon."" ""There's still a lingering notion of Hurston as not quite serious, maybe gifted and intuitive, but not a sound scholar, not a respectable social scientist. But she really was ahead of her time."" Hurston was first dispatched to Plateau, Ala., in 1927, at the behest of Franz Boas, her mentor and professor at Barnard. Boas, an influential anthropologist, urged her to interview Lewis for The Journal of Negro History. Doing field research in the segregated South was challenging for a single African-American woman, and Hurston, who was then in her mid-30s, occasionally slept in her car when she couldn't find a hotel that would rent her a room, and traveled with a pistol for protection.

It was a momentous assignment: ""Of all the millions transported from Africa to the Americas, only one man is left,"" she wrote in ""Barracoon."" ""The only man on earth who has in his heart the memory of his African home; the horrors of a slave raid; the barracoon; the Lenten tones of slavery; and who has 67 years of freedom in a foreign land behind him."" Hurston returned to Alabama to speak to Lewis again in 1931, and spent several months visiting him, gradually coaxing out his story.

""Barracoon,"" which comes out May 8, takes its title from the barracks that enslaved Africans were kept in before they were forced onto slave ships. It tells the story of Lewis's capture by Dahomey warriors in West Africa, and how he was sold to slavers and taken to Mobile, Ala., in 1859, more than 50 years after the United States Congress had outlawed the slave trade, in what Hurston describes as the ""last deal in human flesh.""

He told Hurston about the roughly five years he spent enslaved, how he gained his freedom when Union soldiers appeared one day and told him he didn't belong to anyone anymore, and how he joined together with a group of other former slaves and helped to establish Africatown, a community founded and run by Africans. ""Barracoon"" unfolds largely as a monologue from Lewis, with an introduction and occasional interjections from Hurston. Some days, he didn't feel like talking, so she helped him with chores. Other days, he grew exhausted by her questions and told her she wanted to know too much. At times, he was so overcome by painful memories that he couldn't speak, like when he recalled the day his village was attacked by Dahomey warriors, who beheaded victims they deemed too weak to be sold, and smoked their victims' heads to preserve them. ""His agony was so acute that he became inarticulate,"" Hurston wrote. She would bring him food, a basket of peaches or a Virginia ham, and tell him stories to break the ice. When Lewis was feeling chatty, he could go on for hours, and Hurston cedes the narrative to him for long, meandering stretches. ""She wanted us to hear his voice and she kept herself out of it as much as possible,"" said Alice Walker, who wrote a foreword to ""Barracoon."" ""She knew it was important for us to hear from him."" Scholars of Hurston's work have long known of the manuscript's existence, but few recognized its significance. Some thought Hurston's historical research was sloppy, even unethical. Before she wrote ""Barracoon,"" Hurston detailed her conversations with Lewis in an article published in The Journal of Negro History, titled ""Cudjo's Own Story of the Last African Slaver."" Parts of the article borrowed from another scholarly work, Emma Langdon Roche's ""Historic Sketches of the South,"" without proper attribution, and the appearance of plagiarism cast a shadow over ""Barracoon."" Robert E. Hemenway, who published a biography of Hurston in 1977, treated ""Barracoon"" as an extension of the article, and argued that Hurston had taken creative liberties, recreating Lewis's story ""as an artist rather than as a folklorist or historian.""

In her final decades, she slipped into obscurity. She worked as a substitute teacher and house cleaner in Florida to pay the bills. When she died at 69, she was buried in an unmarked grave. ""Barracoon"" was never really lost. It was preserved in the archives at Howard University, in a collection of papers from one of Hurston's professors and mentors, Alain Locke. But it wasn't until recently that the executors of Hurston's trust began considering the commercial potential for ""Barracoon,"" and the cultural impact it could have. Lois Hurston Gaston, a grandniece of Hurston's and one of the trustees, said that in August 2016, they began re-evaluating Hurston's archives and looking for previously unpublished works, and Cudjo Lewis's story jumped out. ""Racial issues have not gone away in our country, and we felt that this was an opportune time to publish 'Barracoon',"" Ms. Gaston said. ""It's an important time in our cultural history, and here we have the story of Cudjo Lewis to remind us of what happens when we lose sight of our humanity."" Hurston referred to Lewis by his African name, Kossola. Once, when she addressed him that way, tears welled up in his eyes, and he told her, ""Nobody don't callee me my name from cross de water but you.""","""Barracoon"" is a devastating account of the life of Cudjo Lewis, the last living person who was brought to America on a slave ship.",dab5e347-026d-5eff-9f9e-24f3171be4bd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/04/books/review/04ZORA/04ZORA-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=210&w=402&s=ae113dd907455954fa447200c4143c4743368f07748e2fb11e0c30450a1fb0be&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"In 1931, publishers were unimpressed with Zora Neale Hurston&rsquo;s &ldquo;Barracoon.&rdquo; One offered to buy it if she rewrote it &ldquo;in language rather than dialect.&rdquo; Hurston refused, and the book was never published until now.",dab5e347-026d-5eff-9f9e-24f3171be4bd,Demo_data/D1_img2/1dab5e347-026d-5eff-9f9e-24f3171be4bd.jpg,13,"A Work by Zora Neale Hurston Will Finally Be Published In 1931, publishers were unimpressed with Zora Neale Hurston's ""Barracoon.""

""The only man on earth who has in his heart the memory of his African home; the horrors of a slave raid; the barracoon; the Lenten tones of slavery; and who has 67 years of freedom in a foreign land behind him."" Hurston returned to Alabama to speak to Lewis again in 1931, and spent several months visiting him, gradually coaxing out his story.

""Barracoon,"" which comes out May 8, takes its title from the barracks that enslaved Africans were kept in before they were forced onto slave ships. It tells the story of Lewis's capture by Dahomey warriors in West Africa, and how he was sold to slavers and taken to Mobile, Ala., in 1859, more than 50 years after the United States Congress had outlawed the slave trade, in what Hurston describes as the ""last deal in human flesh.""

He told Hurston about the roughly five years he spent enslaved, how he gained his freedom when Union soldiers appeared one day and told him he didn't belong to anyone anymore, and how he joined together with a group of other former slaves and helped to establish Africatown, a community founded and run by Africans. ""Barracoon"" unfolds largely as a monologue from Lewis, with an introduction and occasional interjections from Hurston. Some days, he didn't feel like talking, so she helped him with chores. Other days, he grew exhausted by her questions and told her she wanted to know too much. At times, he was so overcome by painful memories that he couldn't speak, like when he recalled the day his village was attacked by Dahomey warriors, who beheaded victims they deemed too weak to be sold, and smoked their victims' heads to preserve them. ""His agony was so acute that he became inarticulate,"" Hurston wrote. She would bring him food, a basket of peaches or a Virginia ham, and tell him stories to break the ice. When Lewis was feeling chatty, he could go on for hours, and Hurston cedes the narrative to him for long, meandering stretches. ""She wanted us to hear his voice and she kept herself out of it as much as possible,"" said Alice Walker, who wrote a foreword to ""Barracoon."" ""She knew it was important for us to hear from him."" Scholars of Hurston's work have long known of the manuscript's existence, but few recognized its significance. Some thought Hurston's historical research was sloppy, even unethical. Before she wrote ""Barracoon,"" Hurston detailed her conversations with Lewis in an article published in The Journal of Negro History, titled ""Cudjo's Own Story of the Last African Slaver."" Parts of the article borrowed from another scholarly work, Emma Langdon Roche's ""Historic Sketches of the South,"" without proper attribution, and the appearance of plagiarism cast a shadow over ""Barracoon."" Robert E. Hemenway, who published a biography of Hurston in 1977, treated ""Barracoon"" as an extension of the article, and argued that Hurston had taken creative liberties, recreating Lewis's story ""as an artist rather than as a folklorist or historian.""

In her final decades, she slipped into obscurity. She worked as a substitute teacher and house cleaner in Florida to pay the bills. When she died at 69, she was buried in an unmarked grave. ""Barracoon"" was never really lost. It was preserved in the archives at Howard University, in a collection of papers from one of Hurston's professors and mentors, Alain Locke. But it wasn't until recently that the executors of Hurston's trust began considering the commercial potential for ""Barracoon,"" and the cultural impact it could have. Lois Hurston Gaston, a grandniece of Hurston's and one of the trustees, said that in August 2016, they began re-evaluating Hurston's archives and looking for previously unpublished works, and Cudjo Lewis's story jumped out. ""Racial issues have not gone away in our country, and we felt that this was an opportune time to publish 'Barracoon',"" Ms. Gaston said. ""It's an important time in our cultural history, and here we have the story of Cudjo Lewis to remind us of what happens when we lose sight of our humanity."" Hurston referred to Lewis by his African name, Kossola. Once, when she addressed him that way, tears welled up in his eyes, and he told her, ""Nobody don't callee me my name from cross de water but you."" ""Barracoon"" is a devastating account of the life of Cudjo Lewis, the last living person who was brought to America on a slave ship.",,"A Work by Zora Neale Hurston Will Finally Be Published In 1931, publishers were unimpressed with Zora Neale Hurston's ""Barracoon."" One offered to buy it if she rewrote it ""in language rather than dialect."" Hurston refused, and the book was never published until now.

In the spring of 1931, Zora Neale Hurston finished her first book, a 117-page manuscript titled ""Barracoon."" It told the true story of Cudjo Lewis, an Alabama man who was believed to be the last living person captured in Africa and brought to America on a slave ship. Publishers were unimpressed. One offered to buy it if she rewrote it ""in language rather than dialect,"" Hurston wrote in a letter to one of her benefactors. She refused, and ""Barracoon"" was never published. But Hurston kept thinking about Lewis, whose story felt deeply personal to her. About a decade later, she wrote about him in ""Dust Tracks on a Road,"" her autobiography: ""After 75 years, he still had that tragic sense of loss. That yearning for blood and cultural ties. That sense of mutilation. It gave me something to feel about.""

Now, nearly a century after she wrote it, ""Barracoon"" will be made widely available to the public for the first time, in a new edition published by Amistad, a HarperCollins's imprint. The book's release could have a profound impact on Hurston's literary legacy. Hurston, who died in 1960, is best known for her works of fiction, including ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"" and ""Moses, Man of the Mountain."" But she was also a groundbreaking anthropologist and ethnographer, one of the first in her field to record and study African-American folklore, at a time when most scholars ignored black culture, or dismissed it as primitive.

""This is going to make us look at her again as a social scientist,"" said the scholar Deborah G. Plant, who wrote an introduction to ""Barracoon."" ""There's still a lingering notion of Hurston as not quite serious, maybe gifted and intuitive, but not a sound scholar, not a respectable social scientist. But she really was ahead of her time."" Hurston was first dispatched to Plateau, Ala., in 1927, at the behest of Franz Boas, her mentor and professor at Barnard. Boas, an influential anthropologist, urged her to interview Lewis for The Journal of Negro History. Doing field research in the segregated South was challenging for a single African-American woman, and Hurston, who was then in her mid-30s, occasionally slept in her car when she couldn't find a hotel that would rent her a room, and traveled with a pistol for protection.

Real Estate,"In Camden, Development Projects Kindle Hope",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/realestate/commercial/in-camden-development-projects-kindle-hope.html,"CAMDEN, N.J. -- In a city with a bleak history of crime and poverty, plans for real estate development suggest there is new hope for an economic revival, thanks in large part to tax credits from a state-run program. In the last six months, six major development projects have been approved by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority for tax credits worth a total of $614 million, leading to the creation, retention or relocation of some 2,000 jobs in one of the country's poorest cities. The latest approvals, announced by the agency on Tuesday, are for $117.8 million in tax credits to Subaru of America to establish a new headquarters and training center in Camden, and for $39.9 million to Cooper Health, a health care provider already based in Camden, to consolidate its back-office operations, with the retention of some 350 jobs. In addition, new market-rate apartments are being built or renovated to meet growing demand from an expanding medical community, a supermarket operator has just opened a store, and city government has begun the bond-financed demolition of about 600 abandoned houses in an effort to improve a blighted landscape.

""We're working to rebuild Camden and restore a sense of hope and pride,"" Mayor Dana L. Redd said in an interview. ""Our residents are starting to take pride in what they see happening in their city."" Ms. Redd, a Camden native now in her second term, said she measured progress in terms of public safety, education and jobs, and predicted that gains on all three fronts, together with the tax incentives provided by the state, will encourage companies to relocate or expand in Camden. Recent additions include the Philadelphia 76ers, the basketball team announced in June that it would move the team headquarters and practice facility from Philadelphia, just across the Delaware River, to a new 120,000-square-foot building in Camden, bringing 250 jobs to the city by June 2016. The move qualified the N.B.A. franchise for $82 million in tax credits, payable over 10 years, under New Jersey's Economic Opportunity Act of 2013. In July, the state approved $260 million in tax credits for Holtec International, a maker of parts for nuclear power plants, to build a 600,000 square-foot plant in Camden's port area, with the addition of around 400 jobs. And on Nov. 10, the Economic Development Authority said it would provide $107 million in tax credits for the military contractor Lockheed Martin to move 250 jobs to Camden from its location in Moorestown, N.J.

According to the Census Bureau, 38.6 percent of Camden residents lived below the federal poverty line from 2008 to 2012, more than twice the national average. This February, the city was named the most dangerous city of its size in America, according to a national ranking based on F.B.I. data. But crime in the city of about 77,000 residents has fallen since Camden County took over the city's police force in early 2013, putting more officers on the streets. The number of homicides dropped to 28 in 2014 so far from a peak of 58 in all of 2012, while all violent crime was 70 percent lower this summer than last, Ms. Redd said. Meanwhile, the official unemployment rate has dropped to 16 percent from 19 percent in 2010, Ms. Redd said, compared with the current national rate of 5.8 percent. Although a lower crime rate may encourage companies to add workers in Camden, it is less clear whether the new employees will also live there, said Michael Silverman, managing director in the Philadelphia office of Integra Realty Resources, a real estate valuation firm. Without new residents, the city will struggle to recover, he said. ""People will go there to work but you still need people to live there,"" he said. ""The recovery is still a long ways off.""

But in a sign of growing demand for unsubsidized housing, a downtown development of one- and two-bedroom apartments is set to become the city's first new development in more than 10 years to be rented at market rates. The Cooper Village development of 59 new and renovated units, scheduled for completion in June, is expected to be occupied largely by students and nurses from the adjacent Cooper Medical School of Rowan University, said Jason E. Friedland, a partner with Iron Stone Strategic Capital Partners, a Philadelphia company that is developing the complex. Mr. Friedland said the development qualified for tax credits equaling 40 percent of its $18 million cost, payable by the state at 10 percent a year for 10 years. The credit was the biggest incentive for Iron Stone to take on the project, he said, although the company was also motivated by additional historic tax credits for renovating the 100-year-old buildings. The credits helped the company to overcome doubts about Camden that have deterred many other investors over the years, Mr. Friedland said. ""They would say, 'I'm not taking that risk -- it's Camden,'"" he said. But the prospect of market-rate rentals suggests that the Camden market may finally be gathering enough strength to exist without government support, Mr. Friedland said. Robert Corrales, a spokesman for Mayor Redd, confirmed that Cooper Village would be the first new market-rate development in Camden since the city's RCA Victor building, a former gramophone factory on the Delaware River waterfront, was converted into apartments by the developer Carl Dranoff in 2003.

""To see this park utilized by the people, that is a great step for Camden,"" he said. ""This without question is spiritually lifting."" Mr. Mack said the site was once marked with crosses to commemorate people who had died from violence or drugs -- whose effect on the city is still shown by a methadone clinic across the street from the park. Mr. Mack, 41, a construction worker who was off for Veterans Day, said he came from Philadelphia but since 2011 has lived and worked in Camden, where housing is a lot cheaper. He said he was in the process of buying an abandoned building and planned to apply for a grant to renovate it. With more police on the streets, and an improving economy, Mr. Mack said he was feeling better all the time about living in Camden. ""This stuff is turning around,"" he said.","Tax incentives entice companies to bring offices and jobs to the New Jersey city, whose history had been marred by crime and poverty.",e9c14c92-952f-5918-8438-8eabcbf8a011,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/10/realestate/commercial/10camden/10camden-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=c5057d861a8749eb4bd873839671e8628cd472ec01337f1867d55b17e68e9b8c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Home renovations at Sixth and Washington streets in Camden, N.J.",e9c14c92-952f-5918-8438-8eabcbf8a011,Demo_data/D1_img2/1e9c14c92-952f-5918-8438-8eabcbf8a011.jpg,7,"In Camden, Development Projects Kindle Hope CAMDEN, N.J. -- In a city with a bleak history of crime and poverty, plans for real estate development suggest there is new hope for an economic revival, thanks in large part to tax credits from a state-run program.

Real Estate,High Marks for Transit Hubs,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/realestate/new-jersey-in-the-region-high-marks-for-transit-hubs.html,"WANT to know which New Jersey train stations have the most plentiful supply of parking spaces relative to town population? There's a list for that. Or what about stations in the areas with the greatest number of jobs? There's a list for that. Or transportation hubs with the densest populations? There's a list for that as well. In fact, there are dozens of lists, charts and graphs that analyze land use, infrastructure, populations and living conditions surrounding all 243 transit stations in New Jersey. The extensive inventory is the result of a three-year study by NJ Future looking to stratify census data from neighborhoods near the state's transit hubs with an eye toward directing potential development in those areas. The timing of the study -- which maps income, car ownership, employment, housing, commuter activity, downtown amenities and more -- is propitious, given the many indicators that the population will continue to consolidate in urban and commuter town centers. ""It's funny; the timing is working out so well,"" said B. Timothy Evans, the research director at NJ Future, a nonprofit research organization that focuses on smart growth. After three years spent ""putting this thing together,"" he added, it is a stroke of luck that ""the interest is exactly in this sector.""

The interest he cited is being evinced first and foremost by home shoppers. Real estate sales are consistently strongest in towns along New Jersey's main commuter corridors; the economic downturn has not altered that. The latest survey on home prices conducted by the Otteau Valuation Group found that towns along the rail lines with New York City commutes of less than 50 minutes saw real estate values increase by 3.6 percent from 2010 to 2011, as compared with rural New Jersey, the weakest sector, which saw an 8.7 percent drop in home values. The future, too, looks bright for the commuter corridor, according to another Otteau survey, which found that building permits in rail towns reached 49 percent of the total permits issued from 2009 to 2010, having grown from 24 percent in the 1990s. Developers seeking to capitalize on this interest in transit hubs have for the last several years seen their enthusiasm and ambitious plans well rewarded by the state. Public financing for transit-oriented developments, once largely directed at municipalities, is today going directly to developers, in the form of tax credits. New Jersey's Transit Hub Tax Credit Program has provided nearly $1 billion in tax credits over the last three years to developers and business owners who have initiated sizable projects in nine cities deemed ""distressed"" and in need of investment. Bestowed by the state's Economic Development Authority, the tax credits are available to companies investing more than $50 million in projects within half a mile of one of the designated cities' transit stations, and generating more than 250 full-time jobs. Commercial enterprises can receive up to 100 percent tax credit on their capital investment, paid out over 10 years, while residential projects can receive up to 35 percent tax credit on the investment, up from the former cap of 20 percent.

The program has facilitated projects like Teachers Village in Newark, Campbell's Soup's new headquarters in Camden and New Brunswick's Gateway mixed-use development, said Timothy Lizura, a senior vice president of the development authority. ""Developers have many options on where to put their resources,"" he said. ""Sometimes you have to provide the incentive."" The program is capped at $1.5 billion and concludes in January. Another popular state program, called the Transit Village Initiative, supported two dozen municipalities seeking to rebuild neighborhoods around their transit stations. It lost its financing last summer, a victim of Gov. Christopher J. Christie's line-item veto. Joe Dee, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Transportation, which administers the program, said the governor's decision had been made in response to a very tight budget. ""It wasn't in any way a reflection of what the administration thought of transit villages and the benefits associated with them,"" Mr. Dee said. ""It was one of the tough choices that had to be made."" He added that his department had been encouraging current or future transit-village participants to seek funding through the state's municipal aid program. The Transit Village Initiative, which began in 1999, has designated 24 communities throughout the state for planning and financial assistance in revitalizing areas around their transit facilities to create mixed-use neighborhoods, with an emphasis on residential development. To take one example, Somerville became a transit village in 2010, receiving a $100,000 grant to upgrade sidewalks in a redevelopment zone near the train station. With the Transit Village program losing its funding for the current fiscal year, Somerville will not be looking there for the $600,000 it needs to create an arts district between the train station and the Main Street retail center. But Mayor Brian Gallagher isn't worried. ""We're going to sniff it out somewhere else and we'll get it,"" he said. ""We've had great success with this in the past, and we expect to in the future."" As the transportation hub of Somerset County, Somerville has had success in attracting public and private support to its downtown redevelopment efforts. In the first phase of an $80 million development, a new Shop Rite store opened in the center of town last fall; remediation is ongoing at a 130-acre former landfill beside the train station that will eventually be home to as many as 1,100 housing units, and more than 100,000 square feet of retail and commercial space. New Jersey Transit, which owns 35 of the 130 acres, jump-started the redevelopment effort by spending $15.3 million on a new station. ""Money goes where an investment will earn a return,"" Mayor Gallagher said. ""Regardless of whether it's the public sector or the private sector.

Dance,Luca Guadagnino Unleashes the Witchy Power of Modern Dance,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/arts/dance/luca-guadagnino-dance-suspiria-damien-jalet.html,"The language in Luca Guadagnino's remake of the horror film ""Suspiria"" goes beyond words. His witches speak in movement. In one scene, a dancer -- Susie (Dakota Johnson) -- performs in a studio, expelling sharp, sudden breaths as she rises and falls, her arms shooting out like daggers. Another dancer, older and worn down, finds herself locked in a mirrored room; she twitches and contorts as she slams into walls and onto the floor to the sound of her own snapping bones. They protrude through her flesh like splitting seams. What's stunning about the scene isn't just the violence (though that is shocking), but how Susie's movements control the other dancer, and how the energy sweeping through Susie's body is palpably wild and free. The scene also serves as a sly metaphor for what happens when an aging dancer is confronted with a younger, fresher version of herself. There may not be broken bones, but the result can feel just as violent. ""In one room, you see the force of life,"" the film's choreographer, Damien Jalet, said in an interview. ""And in the other it is the force of destruction.""

""Suspiria"" -- as over-the-top as it is -- is different. Most dance films, like ""Center Stage"" and ""Black Swan,"" are riddled with stereotypes. Finally, here is a film that gets dance right. In the original ""Suspiria,"" Dario Argento's 1977 cult classic, a ballet academy is home to a coven of witches. But in Mr. Guadagnino's version, set that same year in divided Cold War Berlin, the dancers gracing the screen aren't ballerinas; they're neither wispy nor ethereal. In Mr. Guadagnino's view, that witchy power is better unleashed through modern dance. ""Dario making it classical ballet was a big mistake, a misstep,"" Mr. Guadagnino said. ""If you are a witch, you are on the fringe. You are not at the center. These are women that don't go for the establishment -- they go for what is on the border of the establishment. I thought it was more important that they were going to be radical artists."" Martha Graham is one of the dance artists haunting this film, along with two German choreographers: the expressionist Mary Wigman (1886-1973) -- aptly, one her most famous works is ""Witch Dance"" -- and Pina Bausch, who created dense, extravagant works of dance-theater. Tilda Swinton, as Madame Blanc, the artistic director of the fictional Helena Markos Dance Company, draws on all three. Slim as a feather, with hair cascading down her back and a cigarette perpetually wedged between her slender fingers, Madame Blanc snaps at dancers but is somehow -- and this is one of many realistic touches in the film -- both sharp and maternal. ""You don't look better,"" she tells Susie at one point. ""Or are you this pale all the time?""

She can also echo Graham, without being a parody of her, when she talks about the power of movement: ""It's a series of energetic shapes written in the air like words forming sentences. Like poems. Like prayers."" How did Mr. Guadagnino, the director responsible for the coming-of-age film ""Call Me by Your Name,"" become so enamored of dance? When he was 15, a couple of years after first he saw ""Suspiria,"" he attended a performance of ""Palermo Palermo,"" by Bausch's Tanztheater Wuppertal. He loved it so much he saw it twice: ""I felt, Why is it that I am watching something that is nonverbal and I'm understanding everything?"" He realized then, he said, that narrative could be transmitted without words.

In ""Suspiria,"" dance is used as a tool to express the power of the witches. ""It's not this kind of marketing idea of the Amazonian world of women who have power,"" Mr. Guadagnino said. ""It's more about, what is at the center of a world of sacrifice, discipline and the bending of bodies?"" To capture the world as authentically as possible, David Kajganich immersed himself in dance history while writing the screenplay. As part of his research, he even shadowed the German choreographer Sasha Waltz. ""It was instrumental in understanding how one talks about dance on a casual level,"" he said.

In the film, Madame Blanc says: ""There are two things that dance can never be again. Beautiful and cheerful. Today we need to break the nose of every beautiful thing."" Mr. Kajganich wrote that line in response to a quotation by Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi minister of propaganda, who in 1937 said, ""Dance must be cheerful and show beautiful female bodies and have nothing to do with philosophy."" ""Suspiria"" also has ties to this period. The Markos Company's signature dance, ""Volk,"" was created in the '40s. A strident work with Ms. Johnson as its centerpiece, ""Volk"" relies on the power of the collective -- hinting at the rise of fascism -- as the dancers play off one another's breath like a pulsating organism. The idea of gravity is there, too; they surrender themselves and their bodies to a certain fate: It's as if there were a gravitational pull that they can't resist. The movement language of the witches dates to 2013 when, at the Louvre, Mr. Jalet, a French-Belgian contemporary choreographer, staged the trio ""Les Medusees,"" inspired by the original ""Suspiria."" In the new version, ""Volk"" is an expanded version of ""Les Medusees."" ""'Volk' is so omnipresent in the film, because they keep on rehearsing it, and they talk a lot about it,"" Mr. Jalet said. ""It was created in the '40s, but still is performed in the '70s. That's a tricky one."" In other words, Mr. Jalet didn't want to get stuck in trying to recreate a historical piece. ""It couldn't be too flowy,"" he said. ""At the same time, I wanted to keep a kind of freedom with it.""

The structure of ""Volk"" is based on a pentagram or two opposing stars. ""It also looked a little bit like a spider's web on which the dancers are moving through kind of a hidden network,"" Mr. Jalet said. ""So they can't really escape."" He made a discovery with Ms. Johnson, who trained for a year before shooting began with Mary Helen Bowers, who worked with Natalie Portman on ""Black Swan."" Her shoulder blades are naturally loose. Very loose. ""Somehow it's disturbing to watch when she's doing it,"" Mr. Jalet said. ""She really transforms -- it's beautiful because it really came from her. It is really showing her."" Ms. Johnson, who was on a dance team in her early teens -- ""I was not very good,"" she stressed -- had no idea that her shoulder blades were so flexible. ""I would do a lot of warm-ups to get my back really loose and warm so that we could exaggerate it even more,"" she said, ""and make it look like an animal."" And not unlike her character, Ms. Johnson discovered, through dance, a power she didn't have before. ""I feel far more connected to my body,"" she said. ""I learned that from the dancers."" ""The life of a dancer now is not easy,"" she added. ""It's not luxurious. It's long hours. It's painful. But moving is their life. It was such an extraordinary thing for me, as a young woman, to see: women living so comfortably and confidently and gratefully in their bodies. I wish that that were something I could impart onto every young woman in the world.""","""Suspiria"" may be over the top.

Another dancer, older and worn down, finds herself locked in a mirrored room; she twitches and contorts as she slams into walls and onto the floor to the sound of her own snapping bones. They protrude through her flesh like splitting seams. What's stunning about the scene isn't just the violence (though that is shocking), but how Susie's movements control the other dancer, and how the energy sweeping through Susie's body is palpably wild and free. The scene also serves as a sly metaphor for what happens when an aging dancer is confronted with a younger, fresher version of herself. There may not be broken bones, but the result can feel just as violent. ""In one room, you see the force of life,"" the film's choreographer, Damien Jalet, said in an interview. ""And in the other it is the force of destruction.""

""Suspiria"" -- as over-the-top as it is -- is different. Most dance films, like ""Center Stage"" and ""Black Swan,"" are riddled with stereotypes. Finally, here is a film that gets dance right. In the original ""Suspiria,"" Dario Argento's 1977 cult classic, a ballet academy is home to a coven of witches. But in Mr. Guadagnino's version, set that same year in divided Cold War Berlin, the dancers gracing the screen aren't ballerinas; they're neither wispy nor ethereal. In Mr. Guadagnino's view, that witchy power is better unleashed through modern dance. ""Dario making it classical ballet was a big mistake, a misstep,"" Mr. Guadagnino said. ""If you are a witch, you are on the fringe. You are not at the center. These are women that don't go for the establishment -- they go for what is on the border of the establishment. I thought it was more important that they were going to be radical artists."" Martha Graham is one of the dance artists haunting this film, along with two German choreographers: the expressionist Mary Wigman (1886-1973) -- aptly, one her most famous works is ""Witch Dance"" -- and Pina Bausch, who created dense, extravagant works of dance-theater. Tilda Swinton, as Madame Blanc, the artistic director of the fictional Helena Markos Dance Company, draws on all three. Slim as a feather, with hair cascading down her back and a cigarette perpetually wedged between her slender fingers, Madame Blanc snaps at dancers but is somehow -- and this is one of many realistic touches in the film -- both sharp and maternal. ""You don't look better,"" she tells Susie at one point. ""Or are you this pale all the time?""

She can also echo Graham, without being a parody of her, when she talks about the power of movement: ""It's a series of energetic shapes written in the air like words forming sentences. Like poems. Like prayers."" How did Mr. Guadagnino, the director responsible for the coming-of-age film ""Call Me by Your Name,"" become so enamored of dance? When he was 15, a couple of years after first he saw ""Suspiria,"" he attended a performance of ""Palermo Palermo,"" by Bausch's Tanztheater Wuppertal. He loved it so much he saw it twice: ""I felt, Why is it that I am watching something that is nonverbal and I'm understanding everything?"" He realized then, he said, that narrative could be transmitted without words.

In ""Suspiria,"" dance is used as a tool to express the power of the witches. ""It's not this kind of marketing idea of the Amazonian world of women who have power,"" Mr. Guadagnino said. ""It's more about, what is at the center of a world of sacrifice, discipline and the bending of bodies?"" To capture the world as authentically as possible, David Kajganich immersed himself in dance history while writing the screenplay. As part of his research, he even shadowed the German choreographer Sasha Waltz. ""It was instrumental in understanding how one talks about dance on a casual level,"" he said.

In the film, Madame Blanc says: ""There are two things that dance can never be again. Beautiful and cheerful. Today we need to break the nose of every beautiful thing."" Mr. Kajganich wrote that line in response to a quotation by Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi minister of propaganda, who in 1937 said, ""Dance must be cheerful and show beautiful female bodies and have nothing to do with philosophy."" ""Suspiria"" also has ties to this period. The Markos Company's signature dance, ""Volk,"" was created in the '40s. A strident work with Ms. Johnson as its centerpiece, ""Volk"" relies on the power of the collective -- hinting at the rise of fascism -- as the dancers play off one another's breath like a pulsating organism. The idea of gravity is there, too; they surrender themselves and their bodies to a certain fate: It's as if there were a gravitational pull that they can't resist. The movement language of the witches dates to 2013 when, at the Louvre, Mr. Jalet, a French-Belgian contemporary choreographer, staged the trio ""Les Medusees,"" inspired by the original ""Suspiria."" In the new version, ""Volk"" is an expanded version of ""Les Medusees."" ""'Volk' is so omnipresent in the film, because they keep on rehearsing it, and they talk a lot about it,"" Mr. Jalet said. ""It was created in the '40s, but still is performed in the '70s. That's a tricky one."" In other words, Mr. Jalet didn't want to get stuck in trying to recreate a historical piece. ""It couldn't be too flowy,"" he said. ""At the same time, I wanted to keep a kind of freedom with it.""

The structure of ""Volk"" is based on a pentagram or two opposing stars. ""It also looked a little bit like a spider's web on which the dancers are moving through kind of a hidden network,"" Mr. Jalet said. ""So they can't really escape."" He made a discovery with Ms. Johnson, who trained for a year before shooting began with Mary Helen Bowers, who worked with Natalie Portman on ""Black Swan."" Her shoulder blades are naturally loose. Very loose. ""Somehow it's disturbing to watch when she's doing it,"" Mr. Jalet said. ""She really transforms -- it's beautiful because it really came from her. It is really showing her."" Ms. Johnson, who was on a dance team in her early teens -- ""I was not very good,"" she stressed -- had no idea that her shoulder blades were so flexible. ""I would do a lot of warm-ups to get my back really loose and warm so that we could exaggerate it even more,"" she said, ""and make it look like an animal."" And not unlike her character, Ms. Johnson discovered, through dance, a power she didn't have before. ""I feel far more connected to my body,"" she said. ""I learned that from the dancers."" ""The life of a dancer now is not easy,"" she added. ""It's not luxurious. It's long hours. It's painful. But moving is their life. It was such an extraordinary thing for me, as a young woman, to see: women living so comfortably and confidently and gratefully in their bodies. I wish that that were something I could impart onto every young woman in the world."" ""Suspiria"" may be over the top. But, finally, here is a film that gets dance right.",6,['6'],6
Economy,Recession's True Cost Is Still Being Tallied,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/business/economy/the-cost-of-the-financial-crisis-is-still-being-tallied.html,"Job seekers in line at a job fair in Chicago. Economists say joblessness damages physical and mental health, breeds poverty and affects the structure of families.

On Sept. 15, 2008, the investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed after a long struggle to avoid bankruptcy, paralyzing the world's financial networks and tipping the United States economy into an abyss from which it has not yet fully emerged. More than five years later, there is still no answer to perhaps the most critical question raised by the man-made disaster: How much did it all cost? In July, three economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Tyler Atkinson, David Luttrell and Harvey Rosenblum, gave it a shot, at least as far as the United States economy goes. Their analysis -- cautious and tentative, critically dependent on debatable assumptions -- underscores how difficult it is, still, to accurately tally the costs of the most severe economic catastrophe since the Depression of the 1930s into a coherent, conclusive measure of loss.

""It is not difficult to understand why such accounting exercises are rare,"" they wrote. ""They require comparing a world in which no financial crisis occurred to what actually happened and what is likely to transpire."" Most strikingly, their examination offers a panoramic view of the variety of ways in which the financial crisis diminished the nation's standard of living. At a bare minimum the crisis cost nearly $20,000 for each American. Adding in broader impacts on workers' well-being -- an admittedly speculative exercise -- could raise the price tag to as much as $120,000 for every man, woman and child in the United States. With this kind of money we could pay back the federal debt or pay for a top-notch college education for everyone. The portrait of loss, tentative as it is, suggests that even the most far-reaching measures might be justified to ensure it never happens again. But you wouldn't know that from the current debate. In December, the American Bankers Association sued to stop a provision of the Volcker Rule, part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, and intended to stop banks from engaging in risky trading on their own account. It pretty much won, convincing regulators that forcing banks to get rid of a complex debt security used by smaller institutions to raise capital would impose immediate and unnecessary costs on small community banks.

Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission has taken a legal battering at the hand of business-friendly judges arguing that the agency has not adequately assessed whether the benefits of its rules justify the costs. This has largely stopped the agency's rule-making. Regulators creating international banking standards in Basel, Switzerland, have also faced a drumbeat of criticism from bankers who argue that proposed rules to increase the capital cushion international banks must amass to buffer against losses would slice 3.5 percent from the world's economic output and cost 7.5 million jobs. This month, as American regulators watered down the Volcker Rule in response to the bankers' lawsuit, regulators in Basel agreed to soften some of their capital requirements, too. Over all, almost half the rules required by the Dodd-Frank legislation have yet to be written. But the financial industry would love to slow regulation further. ""Our goal is to press the pause button on the multitude of regulations and rules, to give the industry time to digest them,"" said James Ballentine, executive vice president for congressional relations for the banking association. ""The industry should have an opportunity to determine what is working and what is not.""

* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations. The bankers' points are not necessarily wrong. Regulation does impose costs. Some banking rules and regulations might make loans scarcer or more expensive. Restrictions on banks' businesses are likely to eat into their profitability. Nonetheless, the legal attack on the new regulation is disingenuous. Increasing the industry's costs and reducing its profits is an objective of the regulation overhaul, not a bug. The goal is to ensure that banks internalize the costs of their risky business rather than have them borne by the rest of society. ""Regulatory agencies are being sued to prevent that the law be put in place because it will cause the industry that crashed the world to lose money,"" said Dennis Kelleher, who heads Better Markets, a nonprofit formed after the financial crisis to press for stricter regulation of the banking sector. ""But Congress made the decision of who was going to bear the costs.""

Indeed, even if financial regulation imposes broader economic costs, what matters is how they measure up against the benefit of preventing another financial disaster. The position taken by bankers, business-friendly judges and many Republicans in Congress is that every new financial rule must justify its existence based on a narrow monetary tally of costs and benefits. But the approach ignores the far greater benefits promised by the entire regulatory package. To start, the economists at the Dallas Fed modeled how much economic activity would be lost by the time the nation returned to its growth path before the crisis. In their study, they initially assumed that the economy would return to its previous path by 2023, and concluded that the total loss would amount to 40 percent to 90 percent of a year's worth of economic output. That's about $6 trillion to $14 trillion in today's money -- or $19,000 to $45,000 per person. Others have used different methods and come up with similar estimates. Better Markets estimated that the crisis cost $12.8 trillion in lost output.  But what if the path is not recovered so quickly? So far, the economy has made up little if any of the ground it lost. Perhaps the shock from the crisis slowed the nation's growth rate for good. Under a more pessimistic assumption, the Dallas Fed economists estimated that the cost could be 65 percent to 165 percent of annual output. The upper limit amounts to about $25 trillion, almost $80,000 per American. But even that might be an underestimate. Using a different method of analysis, the economists also looked at how Americans cut back on purchases of consumer goods. They concluded that the expectations of the lifetime income of working age adults fell by almost $150,000, on average.

Most tallies stop there. But that is not because this covers the entire fallout from the crisis. Rather, it is because the rest is even harder to measure. Consider joblessness, which damages physical and mental health and breeds poverty, which contributes to crime. It affects the structure of families. Only about 500,000 new households were formed each year from 2007 to 2010, a third of the average pace during the previous decade. It is impossible to put an accurate dollar sign on these social costs. Still, the economists at the Dallas Fed tried. Recent research suggests that a jobless worker's well-being declines 15 times as much as would be justified by the loss of income alone. Based on that number, Mr. Luttrell, who remains at the Dallas Fed, and Mr. Atkinson and Mr. Rosenblum, who have left, concluded that the unemployment spike between 2008 and 2012, which reduced aggregate wages by $900 billion, had the same effect on workers' well-being as having lost $14 trillion, approximately another year of economic production in the United States. Finally, estimates of the costs of the crisis would be incomplete without an assessment of the government's role. And the Dallas economists borrowed an old estimate by the International Monetary Fund that direct support above and beyond the previously existing public safety net totaled 82 percent of the nation's G.D.P. -- about $12.6 trillion. This is about the size of the federal government's debt to the public. While all those numbers shouldn't be taken at face value, the damages potentially add up to a staggering total. Even acknowledging that they are imprecise, speculative proxies of the true costs of our financial mess, they underscore how estimates of loss based solely on lost G.D.P. are far too conservative. The Fed economists refrained from adding up the disparate costs from their analyses -- which could risk double-counting losses. But simply adding the cost from the drop in well-being of the unemployed to the impact on G.D.P. would take the price tag to up to $120,000 a person. And that still leaves out many other measures of loss. Every time you hear about the need to balance the costs of new financial regulations against their benefits, it might do well to think about that.","Last year, the Government Accountability Office estimated that the price tag could range from a few trillion dollars to over $10 trillion.",4fa3ea9e-b19f-505e-8448-e058af424bb5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/02/29/business/eduardo-porter/eduardo-porter-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2014&h=900&w=600&s=e0f5bc829638945c9b9699e41305b013e6fb17053b1c05c78d9b02c6891b47ef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Eduardo Porter,4fa3ea9e-b19f-505e-8448-e058af424bb5,Demo_data/D1_img2/14fa3ea9e-b19f-505e-8448-e058af424bb5.jpg,8,"Recession's True Cost Is Still Being Tallied Job seekers in line at a job fair in Chicago.

That institution now hopes to become ""the epicenter of scholarship"" about the French artist, with the establishment of a center for the exhibition and study of his work that is slated to open in 2021, said Christopher Bedford, the museum's director.

The museum has over 1,200 pieces by Matisse, many the result of a 1949 bequest by the Baltimore sisters and collectors Claribel and Etta Cone, who had amassed some 500 of his works, including the famous ""Blue Nude"" (1907) and ""Large Reclining Nude"" (1935). The museum has since acquired more than 700 others.

The new 3,500-square-foot facility, the Ruth R. Marder Center for Matisse Studies, is supported by a $5 million gift from the Ruth Carol Fund . (Marder, a philanthropist, created the fund.) The center, which will take over part of the museum's first floor, will offer new exhibitions and symposiums, but the primary goal will be to ""establish a brain trust within the institution,"" Mr . Bedford said.

Yves-Alain Bois, a Matisse expert, said the center could considerably expand the historical record of Matisse's life and legacy, which, surprisingly, contains significant holes.

Health,New Mammogram Recommendations: A Guide,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/21/health/american-cancer-society-mammogram-guidelines.html,"Q. What are the new recommendations about mammograms, and how do they differ from the old ones? A. The American Cancer Society issued new guidelines on Tuesday, recommending that women with an average risk of breast cancer have mammography starting at age 45 and continuing once a year until 54, and then every other year for as long as they are healthy and likely to live another 10 years. Previously, the society recommended mammograms every year starting at 40. But the cancer society said that women 40 to 44 should still ""have the opportunity"" to have mammograms if they want them, and that women 55 and older should be able to have them once a year if they choose. The guidelines apply only to women with an average risk of breast cancer, not those whose risk is high because of their personal or family history.

Q. Why did the cancer society change its position? A. The changes were the result of an exhaustive review of the medical literature, something that the group conducts periodically to keep its screening guidelines up to date, and to balance benefit against harm. It found increasing evidence that although mammography can prevent deaths from breast cancer, it is less helpful in women under 45, and carries risks like false positives and, potentially, the diagnosis and treatment of small, unaggressive cancers that might never have bothered the patient if left alone. For younger women, the harms appeared to outweigh the benefits.

Less frequent screening in women over 55 was considered sufficient because if they develop cancer, it is more likely to be slower-growing and less aggressive than tumors in younger women. Q. What do the new guidelines say about clinical breast exams? A. They no longer recommend clinical breast exams, in which doctors or nurses feel for lumps, for women of any age who have no symptoms or abnormalities. Previously, the cancer society recommended them once a year for all women 19 and over. But the society said it found little evidence that they help, and some that they could cause false positives that would trigger more testing. Q. Do other health organizations agree with these new guidelines? A. No. Some recommend more screening, and some less. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, an alliance of prominent cancer centers, recommends mammograms every year starting at age 40.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends mammograms every year or two from 40 to 49, and every year after 50. The United States Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of experts appointed by the Department of Health and Human Services, recommends a later start and less frequent testing: mammograms every other year for women 50 to 74. Q. Given the conflicting advice, how are women supposed to figure out what to do? A. All the groups agree that mammography can reduce a woman's risk of dying from breast cancer, by about 20 percent.

What are the new recommendations about mammograms, and how do they differ from the old ones? A. The American Cancer Society issued new guidelines on Tuesday, recommending that women with an average risk of breast cancer have mammography starting at age 45 and continuing once a year until 54, and then every other year for as long as they are healthy and likely to live another 10 years. Previously, the society recommended mammograms every year starting at 40. But the cancer society said that women 40 to 44 should still ""have the opportunity"" to have mammograms if they want them, and that women 55 and older should be able to have them once a year if they choose. The guidelines apply only to women with an average risk of breast cancer, not those whose risk is high because of their personal or family history.

Q. Why did the cancer society change its position? A. The changes were the result of an exhaustive review of the medical literature, something that the group conducts periodically to keep its screening guidelines up to date, and to balance benefit against harm. It found increasing evidence that although mammography can prevent deaths from breast cancer, it is less helpful in women under 45, and carries risks like false positives and, potentially, the diagnosis and treatment of small, unaggressive cancers that might never have bothered the patient if left alone. For younger women, the harms appeared to outweigh the benefits.

Less frequent screening in women over 55 was considered sufficient because if they develop cancer, it is more likely to be slower-growing and less aggressive than tumors in younger women. Q. What do the new guidelines say about clinical breast exams? A. They no longer recommend clinical breast exams, in which doctors or nurses feel for lumps, for women of any age who have no symptoms or abnormalities. Previously, the cancer society recommended them once a year for all women 19 and over. But the society said it found little evidence that they help, and some that they could cause false positives that would trigger more testing. Q. Do other health organizations agree with these new guidelines? A. No. Some recommend more screening, and some less. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, an alliance of prominent cancer centers, recommends mammograms every year starting at age 40.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends mammograms every year or two from 40 to 49, and every year after 50. The United States Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of experts appointed by the Department of Health and Human Services, recommends a later start and less frequent testing: mammograms every other year for women 50 to 74. Q. Given the conflicting advice, how are women supposed to figure out what to do? A. All the groups agree that mammography can reduce a woman's risk of dying from breast cancer, by about 20 percent. But when it comes to when to start and how often to screen, many experts say there is no one answer that suits all women. Those who want to find tumors when they are as small and as early as possible should screen earlier and more often -- provided that they can live with the high likelihood that at some point they will be called back to the clinic for more testing based on a false positive.

Travel,A Lighting Designer on Lighting Hotels,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/21/travel/hotel-lighting-design.html,"How did you transition to hotels and more permanent spaces?

Nightclubs are sort of semi-permanent. You meet all these people who like your work and they are attending the clubs as patrons or as promoters. They work there and then they go off and they open up their restaurants or they do movies and music videos and you are brought along by them. Then after a little while you want to make yourself legitimate and actually make some money, so I formalized it and opened up my first company.

How do you approach your work? Is it just a matter of choosing the right color lighting?

I'm not providing light. It's not what we do. You sort of get that for free. What we're really providing is the spark. It's the mood. I always tell people that there's three ways to do it right and a hundred ways to do it wrong. If you're looking at it from just the lighting point of view, like how do we get light into this space then you're doing it wrong. If you're thinking about the story the space is telling, and listening to the owners and the architects about the vision, you're doing it right.

What are examples of masculine and feminine design in hotels?

A masculine space is going to be darker, with darker finishes, deeper materials, darker oak. A feminine space is going to tend to be a little bit lighter. If you're going with deep bronze for the masculine, you may go with a brushed brass or a brushed bronze for the feminine. A masculine hotel might have darker hallways, open bathroom trash cans, less lighting around a bathroom mirror. Masculine spaces tend to have a lot of hardware and a lot of hard 90 degree angles, whereas feminine spaces tend to have softer angles and fuller bodied turns.

Why do hotels go with masculine over feminine design or vice versa?

It has to do with who they're trying to attract as a customer. I have noticed in the last 10 years hotels area are a little less binary. They're sort of in the middle. Some hotels veer a little bit to the feminine side and some hotels straddle the middle. There are fewer masculine hotels because more bookings in the last 10 years have come from women, so the hotels have changed their tack dramatically because they realize that.

How do you avoid skewing to masculine design?

I'm currently choosing colors to illuminate an outdoor events area at the Peninsula Hotel. I started choosing colors and I realized about halfway through that all the colors that I was choosing were a little bit more from my point of view. I had to think about what would women want?

Late summer and early fall can bring some of the balmiest days to the city, and a host of outdoor festivals and one-off concerts offer the chance to capitalize on it. Here we provide a quick rundown of the performances you'll want to know about. Now in its 15th year, this festival has expanded far beyond its roots in the D.I.Y. community that was seeking space for black punk bands. Recent iterations have drawn more heavily from the realms of soul, rap and R&B, booking big names to draw tens of thousands of attendees to the two-day event in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. This year's headliners include the cosmic jazz revivalist Kamasi Washington, the neo-soul singer Jill Scott and the British pop hypnotist FKA twigs; other noteworthy acts include the surrealist rapper Tierra Whack and the singer-songwriter Lianne La Havas. General admission tickets for Saturday have sold out, but tickets for Sunday are available, as are V.I.P. tickets and weekend passes. Aug. 24-25; afropunk.com. OLIVIA HORN

A trusty New York ritual now in its 27th year, this free festival attracts overflow crowds to public parks throughout Harlem and the East Village. The highlights come at Marcus Garvey Park -- where Mwenso and the Shakes will present their nouveau jazz revue on Friday evening, and the vocalist Dee Dee Bridgewater will top the bill on Saturday afternoon -- and at Tompkins Square Park on Sunday afternoon, when the drummer Carl Allen will pay tribute to Art Blakey, and the tenor saxophonist George Coleman, a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, will lead a trio.

Out of a Nine Inch Nails sample, a Dutch producer's bedroom studio, and a teenage rapper's playful mind came the smash hit of 2019: Lil Nas X's ""Old Town Road."" All of two minutes long, the song has inspired as many think-pieces (on the meaninglessness of genre, on racism in country music, on homophobia in rap) as it has dance parties. Ultimately, it's evidence of a sea change that was bound to happen: the blurring of the divide separating electronic dance music, trap and mainstream country. Further proof of that change: the teaming up of the country singer Kane Brown with the EDM D.J. Marshmello on the new single ""One Thing Right."" Lil Nas X and Marshmello will headline Z100's Summer Bash, and Brown will appear as a special guest. Aug. 29; pier17ny.com.

This bassist, singer and songwriter released her first album in 2012, full of poetic power ballads that told of her desires and insecurities with excruciating precision, and owed equal debts to Fiona Apple, Kim Deal and Liz Phair. Seven years later, she has thoroughly changed her sound (opting for pop grandeur and heavy production on last year's ""Be the Cowboy"") but somehow not her persona. Joining her on the bill across two nights at SummerStage will be Lucy Dacus, another young talent with a literary, confessional songbook. Sept. 7-8; 212-360-2777, cityparksfoundation.org.

Pop's major avatar of digital-age experimentalism and sci-fi fantasy, Monae has gone from Afrofuturist dreamer to Hollywood star, while holding onto her visionary streak. She began working on ""Dirty Computer,"" her most recent album, when Prince, her mentor, was still alive, consulting with him frequently in the early stages of recording. His influence runs throughout the record, which ranges from cyborg funk to politically incisive, take-no-prisoners rap. Sept. 25; pier17ny.com.

Held each year in multiple cities around the world, the Global Citizen Festival applies the old Live Aid stratagem on an even larger scale. The proceeds go toward fighting extreme poverty across the world, and the festival aims to cultivate investment in social-justice work by allowing fans to use actions -- like calling elected representatives or signing petitions -- as currency for obtaining tickets (they can also be purchased). At this year's New York edition, Queen (which performed at the original Live Aid in 1985, and is now fronted by the young pop star Adam Lambert) will headline. The lineup also includes Pharrell Williams, Alicia Keys, Carole King and French Montana. Sept. 28; globalcitizen.org.

Who knew the future would look so apocalyptically homespun -- so ""Mad Max"" meets ""Little House on the Prairie""? Yet this is no useless online fad; homemade masks for all could make a huge difference. At least two peer-reviewed studies show that while DIY masks are not nearly as effective as commercial masks made for health care workers, they are far better than nothing. Homemade masks both limit the spread of infectious droplets in the air and discourage people from touching their faces.

""It's not as good as a surgical mask, but in a pinch, you could use it,"" said Anna Davies, a research facilitator at the University of Cambridge who co-wrote one of the studies on homemade masks. What sort of pinch? As the numbers grow, just about everything in daily life. Say you need to run to the supermarket in an area where there are lots of infections, or you share an apartment with some yahoos who just came back from spring break. ""If I were in an area with very high density, like New York, I can see the benefit,"" Davies said.

The internet abounds with mask designs, but the research suggests that as long as the mask covers your nose and mouth and is comfortable to wear, the specific pattern you choose may not matter very much. Various household materials differ in their effectiveness -- in Davies's study, vacuum-cleaner bags offered better filtration than fabrics made of cotton blends, but plain cotton T-shirt fabric still provided a useful barrier. The template linked here comes from the community-supported, open-source sewing site freesewing.org, meaning, of course, that it requires that you know how to sew. But there are ways to make a mask without sewing -- just cut up a clean T-shirt and tie it around your head, as in this video:

There are caveats: People should make sure their DIY masks are clean (a dirty mask might be worse than no mask), and they shouldn't use the masks as an excuse to violate social-distancing orders. But, keeping those limitations in mind, making a mask for yourself and those you love may be a perfect way to spend an afternoon in lockdown. Farhad wants to chat with readers on the phone.

Health,An Unusual Partnership to Tackle Stubborn Diseases,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/health/nih-joins-drug-makers-and-nonprofits-on-stubborn-diseases.html,"The National Institutes of Health, 10 large drug companies and seven nonprofit organizations announced an unconventional partnership on Tuesday intended to speed up development of drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease, Type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. During the course of a five-year, $230 million effort, the participants will share data in regular conference calls and meetings, working together to determine which findings are likely to lead to effective treatments. They will make their findings and data publicly available. The project is unique, said Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. ""We are getting together in a way that has not happened before,"" Dr. Collins said in an interview. ""We are bringing scientists from different perspectives into the same room. They will leave their egos at the door, leave their affiliations at the door."" Such a collaboration would not have been possible five years ago, said Dr. Mikael Dolsten, president of worldwide research and development at Pfizer, which is participating in the effort. ""It was a different time,"" Dr. Dolsten said. ""Companies had the view that going alone would be sufficient.""

But now many drug companies are chastened. They have invested staggering amounts of money in developing drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease, for example, but again and again the medications have failed in testing. Effective treatments for the three other diseases to be studied have also been elusive. Scientists are struggling with a deluge of data from gene sequencing and other technologies, a flood so enormous that it is difficult even to assess what has been discovered. ""It is almost like you are traveling in a landscape of biology, but there are no clear signposts of where to go,"" Dr. Dolsten said. ""We are wasting resources and time."" The goal of the partnership is to find new drug targets: molecules that can be attacked in order to stop or slow a disease. The Alzheimer's initiative also aims to find reliable molecular signals of whether dementia is progressing, so that new drugs can be tested early enough to avert irreversible brain damage. Currently, clinical trials enrolling patients with early-stage Alzheimer's in the hope of slowing or stopping its course have a problem. Because it can take a decade or so for clear symptoms like confusion, memory loss and loss of judgment to appear, it is hard to determine if a drug is making a difference.

Not everyone was fully won over by the new research paradigm. Dr. Michael D. Lockshin, co-director of the Mary Kirkland Center for Lupus Research at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, said the consortium's approach was ""a very nice response to one aspect of the disease."" But he fears that looking for a single drug target may be too narrow a strategy against lupus, a complicated autoimmune disease. The key to lupus, Dr. Lockshin said, may hinge in part on answering three questions: Why is the ratio of female patients to male patients nine to one? Why is the ratio of black patients to white patients three to one? And why does the disease strike women primarily between the ages of 15 and 35?  Jennifer S. Altman for The New York Times Such characteristics may imply that there is ""an exposure cause,"" Dr. Lockshin said. Rheumatoid arthritis, too, has an unusual distribution, he added: Three women get it for every man. ""I don't deny that you might be able to control some aspects of the disease"" by targeting molecular markers, Dr. Lockshin said. ""But to eradicate it completely, you will need to go into other fields."" Dr. Collins said the partnership would assess its progress in two years, asking at that time if it was reaching specified research milestones.

""If we are not making progress, if this is a model that is not working, we have an opportunity to pull the plug,"" he said. Dr. Collins said he became enthusiastic about the possibility of a collaboration with drug companies and nonprofit groups like the American Diabetes Association and the Alzheimer's Association in May 2011, when he attended an annual meeting of the heads of research and development at major drug companies. ""It was very clear that everybody in the room had the same sense of a real opportunity,"" he said. ""But there was such a thicket of information to try to sift through. No company, no organization, not even the N.I.H. itself, could do this in a timely fashion."" Once the idea of a partnership gained support, the group struggled to decide which diseases to focus on. ""My first instinct was, 'Let's do everything,' "" Dr. Collins said. ""Companies were, 'Wait a minute, not so fast.' "" He and others spoke to researchers at drug companies over the next couple of months, asking them ""to really say straight out what they are interested in,"" Dr. Collins said. ""That was eye-opening,"" he said. ""What came out of it were four diseases."" Cancer was discussed but dropped from the list because the companies thought that they already had many promising targets and that the need was greater elsewhere.","The National Institutes of Health, 10 drug companies and seven nonprofits will collaborate to speed the development of treatments for Alzheimer's, Type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.",773682a9-fd54-5478-bb4e-8673c73811f9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/05/science/05drugs_top/05drugs_top-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2014&h=773&w=600&s=ce68c4b6bc1fe467317b554ce97a85c4a3c7e9d3a2010735febaa7083707fe72&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Francis Collins, the head of the National Institute of Health, in Manhattan in 2009.",773682a9-fd54-5478-bb4e-8673c73811f9,Demo_data/D1_img2/1773682a9-fd54-5478-bb4e-8673c73811f9.jpg,1,"An Unusual Partnership to Tackle Stubborn Diseases The National Institutes of Health, 10 large drug companies and seven nonprofit organizations announced an unconventional partnership on Tuesday intended to speed up development of drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease, Type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.

Real Estate,"Alameda, Calif.: On San Francisco Bay, With Great Views and Rising Prices",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/realestate/alameda-calif-on-san-francisco-bay-with-great-views-and-rising-prices.html,"ALAMEDA, Calif. -- A few years ago, Thushan and Megan Amarasiriwardena considered buying a home in Alamo Square, their neighborhood in San Francisco, but found that even one-bedroom condos were way too expensive. Then they looked at Alameda, a place that Bay Area residents often forget. One of the best things about Alameda is the most obvious: It's an island in the San Francisco Bay (another part is attached to Oakland) with spectacular water and city views. It also exudes character and charm -- barbershops display old-fashioned barber poles on nearly every downtown block, and politely aggressive Girl Scouts sell Thin Mints. The speed limit is mostly 25 miles an hour. The city evokes a Norman Rockwell vision of America, but with more diversity.

By August, they had become Alamedans. They could afford to buy because in 2015, Mr. Amarasiriwardena, 38, sold his start-up, Launchpad Toys, which created apps for children, to Google, where he also works developing the company's robot personality. ""We could finally buy a place,"" he said. Their search was analytical. ""There's speed, quality and cost,"" Mr. Amarasiriwardena said. They were not in a hurry, so they focused on quality and cost. Their spreadsheet listed local asking prices and sale prices. ""We just waited,"" said Ms. Amarasiriwardena, 36. Three times they bid over the asking price; they lost all three. Then something different came on the market: a five-bedroom Victorian between two small apartment buildings, with a towering turret built in 1894, on a main street. At $1.4 million, it was too big and expensive, but when the owner reduced the price to $1.3 million, they attended an open house. ""What struck us was how loved the house was,"" Mr. Amarasiriwardena said, although it needed a new foundation, which could cost $200,000.

The first weekend they went to a pizza parlor and found ""a family crowd, something we didn't realize we didn't have in the city,"" Ms. Amarasiriwardena said. ""I felt we were home."" The couple's enthusiasm has now led to a chain migration: Mr. Amarasiriwardena coaxed two high school friends from his hometown of Amherst, Mass., to settle in Alameda. After Jason Hill, a Washington D.C., health care lobbyist, took a job with the California-based managed health care consortium Kaiser Permanente, he and his wife, Ann Rhodes, a community organizer, looked for a friendly community with a short commute, good schools for their young daughters, and diversity. Guided by a relocation specialist, Mr. Hill spent a day looking for a town to call home. He considered Oakland, Berkeley and Point Richmond before he saw Alameda. It seemed family-friendly and felt like a quaint small town. ""It met a lot of our criteria,"" he said. It wasn't perfect. The family was coming from a neighborhood in Washington that was about 80 percent African-American. Mr. Hill, 47, is African-American, and Ms. Rhodes, 40, is white. And while Alameda prides itself on its diversity, Mr. Hill observed that, compared with their previous experience, there weren't many black residents. The town is 50 percent white, 31 percent Asian, 11 percent Latino and 6 percent African-American, according to U.S. census figures.

In 2018, they rented a house in Alameda and began their hunt. They looked at about 10 houses, settling on a beautiful, refurbished four-bedroom Craftsman from 1920 with a yard on a quiet street, close to Oakland. They paid $1.4 million. Neighbors brought cookies and welcoming cards. When their oldest daughter attended an Alameda public school, she was the only black child in her class. ""That was problematic for us,"" Mr. Hill said. She now attends a Montessori charter school in Oakland, where there are many more children who look like her. Mr. Hill and Ms. Rhodes sold their individual condos in Washington, for $410,000 and $290,000. ""That was the only way we could do it,"" Mr. Hill said. The couple kept the condo they had bought together in Washington and now rent it out. Alameda, home to almost 80,000 residents, is a jigsaw puzzle of a city comprising two main sections -- Alameda Island and Bay Farm Island, which isn't an island but a peninsula attached to Oakland. 1421 SAN ANTONIO AVENUE | A six-bedroom, three-and-two-half-bath house, built in 1898, on 0.25 acres, listed for $2,690,000. 415-787-3450.

On Alameda Island you'll find renovated Craftsman, Tudor, colonial-style and Mediterranean houses, small apartment buildings and regal Victorians. Some houses come without a garage, but street parking in residential areas is abundant. A drive into town from the mainland quickly reduces stress. Children ride bikes with no helicopter parents in sight. Half the town watches the blowout Fourth of July parade; the other half is in it. On warm days, parents take small children to the beach. Windsurfers scrape the sky and there are spectacular views of San Francisco and the Bay. Neighborhoods have block parties, and book clubs are not exclusive.

Before the Naval base closed in 1997, Alameda was a middle-class community with housing for military families.

At Alameda Point, old military housing is used to house formerly homeless families, individuals and veterans, as well as victims of domestic violence. In the next decade, 1,425 new housing units are planned, with 75 percent designated as market-rate housing and the remainder as affordable housing.

Beautifully maintained parks are scattered throughout town, luring young parents with strollers. Much of Alameda is flat, making biking easy for all ages. And residents are, mostly, nice. ""People thank the bus driver when they get off the bus,"" Ms. Ashcraft said. The Alameda Unified School District operates nine elementary schools, including the Maya Lin School, an arts institute named for the artist best known for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.

There are four middle schools and four high schools, including the neoclassical, blocklong Alameda High. Of the students who took the SAT exam during the 2017-18 school year, 85 percent met or exceeded benchmarks for English, compared with 71 percent statewide; 89 percent met or exceeded the benchmarks for math, compared with 51 percent statewide. Gail Payne, Alameda's senior transportation coordinator, said that most residents drive to work. An average of 18,000 ride the bus every day; fares are $3.50 one way or $86.40 for a monthly pass. On a typical workday, 5,200 people take the passenger ferry to the San Francisco Ferry Building, which costs between $3.60 and $7.20 one way. Alameda has two ferry terminals -- one on Main Street, where there are 20 daily trips, and another on Bay Farm Island, which makes eight daily trips. A third terminal is set to open this summer at the Seaplane Lagoon, and will become the main terminal for trips to San Francisco. Others drive to a nearby BART station and pay $4.20 for a 16-minute ride to San Francisco. Tech buses from Silicon Valley pick up and drop off employees in Alameda. During commuting hours, the drive to Silicon Valley can take one to two hours.","An island city celebrates families and diversity, and is finding ways to build affordable housing and confront homelessness.",ee20d9f2-8e9b-5dfe-abd1-47236d146394,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/10/realestate/10LIVING-CA-ALAMEDA-slide-EVKJ/10LIVING-CA-ALAMEDA-slide-EVKJ-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=7cb579599310e1b77d3ed0c3f22ba3e53de003081351170647d373a6685b8bfc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Alameda is dotted with old Victorians.

Theater,Review: Clashing Lives in Tennessee Williams's 'Creve Coeur',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/theater/creve-coeur-review-tennessee-williams.html,"The colors are the least of the things that clash in the small, feverishly decorated apartment that is the setting for Austin Pendleton's overwhelmed revival of Tennessee Williams's ""A Lovely Sunday for Creve Coeur."" Never mind that the stew of bright hues on view here causes one character, a prim visitor of more classic tastes, to recoil as if before a wall of fire.

Sensitive audiences at the Theater at St. Clement's are more likely to be alarmed by the discordance of styles among the four actresses in this late offering from the author of ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" None of the performances from the ensemble here -- which includes the estimable Kristine Nielsen and Annette O'Toole -- seems to match up with any of the others in terms of style, temperament, scale or audibility.

Now you might argue that such disconnectedness is thematically appropriate to a tale of lonely women in futile search of soul mates in Depression-era St. Louis.

Art & Design,Parenting While Black: Titus Kaphar's Starkly Powerful Works,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/16/arts/design/titus-kaphar-gagosian-show.html,"Titus Kaphar's ""The distance between what we have and what we want,"" 2019, is in a show of new works, ""From a Tropical Space,"" at Gagosian.

Titus Kaphar's paintings have always been blunt in confronting both the paucity of Black figures in traditional Western art and the tragic inequities of Black life in the United States. Mr. Kaphar accomplishes this by being a skilled realist painter adept at violating his medium in startling ways to make his points, whether by tearing or cutting his canvases, or covering parts of his images with tar or whitewash. His paintings are conceptual objects freighted with historical or present-day references that require little explanation. They verge on didactic except for the visual richness and emotional directness with which they examine their entwined subjects. With his show of 11 new paintings, Mr. Kaphar becomes the latest successful Black artist to have been taken up by a blue-chip gallery -- Gagosian -- acting on instincts at once admirable and calculating. And like other artists in similar situations -- Mark Bradford, Kehinde Wiley and Theaster Gates -- Mr. Kaphar has made a determined effort to give back. In 2018, he founded, with the entrepreneur Jason Price and the sculptor Jonathan Brand, a New-Haven nonprofit incubator called NXTHVN to train emerging artists and curators of color. Mr. Kaphar's aesthetic efforts walk along an unusually fine line between art and activism. Among his best-known works (not in this show) is ""Behind the Myth of Benevolence"" (2014), in which a careful, flipped replica of Gilbert's Stuart's portrait of Thomas Jefferson has been partly removed from its stretcher and hangs to one side, like a drawn-back curtain. Behind this, solidly attached to the stretcher, is a second canvas and another layer of the great man's personal history: an intimate portrayal of a beautiful young Black woman. Her image refers to Sally Hemings, an enslaved woman of mixed race who belonged to Jefferson, and whose six children were in all likelihood fathered by him.

The paintings in ""From a Tropical Space"" at Gagosian's West 21st Street gallery are as starkly forceful as ever. But they venture much closer to quotidian life, as if to update us on the crushing anxiety that has always been part of parenting while Black in America. The artist starts by making paintings of appropriate photographs of mothers with their children, usually in scenes of domestic calm. Then he simply cuts out the images of the children, leaving the mothers holding empty silhouettes through which the walls they hang on are disconcertingly visible. The contrast of the painted canvas and the sudden gaps has a definite jolt that intensifies as you recognize what has been lost. With their amped up palette of dark pastels and everyday settings, they succeed as paintings to a greater degree than before. And they don't let us off the hook by dwelling on the past. The series' (and exhibition's) title conjures sub-Saharan Africa, from which the ancestors of many American Blacks were torn. One work -- ""Analogous Colors"" -- appeared on the cover of Time magazine's June 15 issue, which reported on the killing of George Floyd. (After all, there is no time limit on losing a child.) The expression on the mother's face here is an unusually complex mixture of tenderness and worry. Several of them look out at us with some degree of wariness, as in one titled ""The distance between what we have and what we want."" The alluring deep pinks, lavenders and blues have a tropical mien, as do occasional, palm trees and the lush foliate patterns that regularly appear as wall paper, drapes and backsplashes or, in ""Aftermath,"" on the roof of a house upended by some kind of natural disaster, possibly a tornado. The painting titled ""From a Tropical Space"" evokes the vibrant hues of a well-known variant of the Pan-African flag in its green grass, red curb and the yellow plastic bags of two mothers, chatting in the street, with strollers that once held their toddlers.

But there is a foreboding, slightly overcast quality to these scenes and carefully placed details add to it and sometimes create a modern iconography. Among these details: a blue rubber glove redolent of coronavirus precautions worn by the mother in ""Analogous Colors."" A garden hose looks innocuous in the chaotic garage of ""Aftermath,"" but it also snakes into other paintings, like the family room in ""Twins,"" the next painting on the gallery's wall. In this scene, it hints at the Garden of Eden, but more strongly evokes the fire hoses directed at protesters during civil rights era, while the vintage television set (with an African sculpture on it) indicates how such violence became known nationwide at the time. That things may not turn out well is signaled by a dead potted plant sitting on a small shelf. In ""Not My Burden,"" two mothers hold their babies, while displayed on the wall behind them is an old sepia photograph of a large white family and their Black servant, who stands at the edge of the frame.

Style,The Man Behind Those Throbbing Warehouse Parties in Brooklyn,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/style/the-man-behind-those-throbbing-warehouse-parties-in-brooklyn.html,"The Man Behind Those Throbbing Warehouse Parties in Brooklyn

Rob Toma surveyed the techno rave scene that his company, Teksupport, held at a warehouse in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Christopher Lee for The New York Times

An army of young people swarmed through the darkened rectangles of industrial Brooklyn, orienteering by thudding beats and prismatic light to a former shipbuilding factory. They wore chokers and tracksuits, accessorized with sunglasses and devil sticks. This was not an illegal rave, the kind where attendees risked nose-diving through rotten floorboards or fleeing a police raid. Instead the party, which took place in February inside a giant warehouse at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, had $130 backstage tickets, meaty throngs of security and Eric Prydz, a famed techno D.J. from Sweden who performs as Pryda. By 2 a.m. that Sunday morning, several thousand revelers bobbed beneath a lattice of white lasers. Some lined up for $11 tall boys of Heineken. Models in leather pants and men in scoop-neck tees occupied a V.I.P. section with plush chairs and bottle service. On the dance floor, a man who resembled Jose Canseco gyrated in a Trukfit tank top near a guy in a shirt with ""Venmo"" printed across the chest (it looked more like swag than ironic culture jamming).

The low-profile man behind this rave is Rob Toma, a 36-year-old party veteran who was raised in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn. ""New Yorkers are very, very spoiled,"" Mr. Toma said, seated in the driver's seat of a black Rolls-Royce Wraith, as he waited for the club to fill. ""Everything has to be bigger and better. It has to have this mega-festival feel. It's like Burning Man meets raves meets illegal meets Pacha."" After entering the warehouse through a back entrance, Mr. Toma ascended a staircase to a catwalk above the crowd and surveyed his domain. It was a vast, if sterile, kingdom of metal, concrete and bountiful porta potties. It had neither the lawless grunge of an illegal rave nor the considered hospitality of a nightclub.

Mr. Toma has been going to parties for most of his life. As a teenager in the late 1990s, he held hip-hop parties while attending Xaverian High School in Brooklyn. During his senior year, he visited the Sound Factory, an iconic megaclub on the West Side of Manhattan, and began his journey into dance music. His parents, who immigrated from Egypt, saw him as a potential doctor or lawyer, and he attended two years of college at St. John's University's Staten Island campus. ""But I found myself promoting, networking, brokering frat parties,"" he said. That path led to jobs at clubs like Exit, Spirit, Crobar and Pacha, as well as six consecutive seasons in Ibiza. ""Rob is extremely well networked and plugged in on an international scale,"" said Michael Delle Donne of Resident Advisor, an electronic music platform that frequently sells tickets to Teksupport events. ""He really lives behind the scenes, behind the curtains and out of the spotlight. He'll be in the greenroom working on a computer while the event is raging."" Unlike the dance clubs he grew up with in the 1990s, which came under siege by former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Teksupport has a cozier relationship with city officials. Its breakthrough event -- importing Time Warp, a German electronic music festival, to Brooklyn in 2014 -- took place on the city-owned South Brooklyn Marine Terminal in Sunset Park. Mr. Toma credits relationships with community boards and Mayor Bill de Blasio's Office of Nightlife. ""It's like, whoa, they finally woke up and smelled the coffee,"" Mr. Toma said. ""There's a lot of up-and-coming politicians coming in.

An army of young people swarmed through the darkened rectangles of industrial Brooklyn, orienteering by thudding beats and prismatic light to a former shipbuilding factory. They wore chokers and tracksuits, accessorized with sunglasses and devil sticks. This was not an illegal rave, the kind where attendees risked nose-diving through rotten floorboards or fleeing a police raid. Instead the party, which took place in February inside a giant warehouse at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, had $130 backstage tickets, meaty throngs of security and Eric Prydz, a famed techno D.J. from Sweden who performs as Pryda. By 2 a.m. that Sunday morning, several thousand revelers bobbed beneath a lattice of white lasers. Some lined up for $11 tall boys of Heineken. Models in leather pants and men in scoop-neck tees occupied a V.I.P. section with plush chairs and bottle service. On the dance floor, a man who resembled Jose Canseco gyrated in a Trukfit tank top near a guy in a shirt with ""Venmo"" printed across the chest (it looked more like swag than ironic culture jamming).

The low-profile man behind this rave is Rob Toma, a 36-year-old party veteran who was raised in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn. ""New Yorkers are very, very spoiled,"" Mr. Toma said, seated in the driver's seat of a black Rolls-Royce Wraith, as he waited for the club to fill. ""Everything has to be bigger and better. It has to have this mega-festival feel. It's like Burning Man meets raves meets illegal meets Pacha."" After entering the warehouse through a back entrance, Mr. Toma ascended a staircase to a catwalk above the crowd and surveyed his domain. It was a vast, if sterile, kingdom of metal, concrete and bountiful porta potties. It had neither the lawless grunge of an illegal rave nor the considered hospitality of a nightclub.

Mr. Toma has been going to parties for most of his life. As a teenager in the late 1990s, he held hip-hop parties while attending Xaverian High School in Brooklyn. During his senior year, he visited the Sound Factory, an iconic megaclub on the West Side of Manhattan, and began his journey into dance music. His parents, who immigrated from Egypt, saw him as a potential doctor or lawyer, and he attended two years of college at St. John's University's Staten Island campus. ""But I found myself promoting, networking, brokering frat parties,"" he said. That path led to jobs at clubs like Exit, Spirit, Crobar and Pacha, as well as six consecutive seasons in Ibiza. ""Rob is extremely well networked and plugged in on an international scale,"" said Michael Delle Donne of Resident Advisor, an electronic music platform that frequently sells tickets to Teksupport events. ""He really lives behind the scenes, behind the curtains and out of the spotlight. He'll be in the greenroom working on a computer while the event is raging."" Unlike the dance clubs he grew up with in the 1990s, which came under siege by former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Teksupport has a cozier relationship with city officials. Its breakthrough event -- importing Time Warp, a German electronic music festival, to Brooklyn in 2014 -- took place on the city-owned South Brooklyn Marine Terminal in Sunset Park. Mr. Toma credits relationships with community boards and Mayor Bill de Blasio's Office of Nightlife. ""It's like, whoa, they finally woke up and smelled the coffee,"" Mr. Toma said.

Real Estate,The Gang's All Here,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/01/realestate/friends-who-choose-to-live-in-the-same-building.html,"Living down the hall from a bosom buddy is the stuff of sitcoms. Consider Lucy and Ethel in ""I Love Lucy,"" Seinfeld and Kramer in ""Seinfeld,"" or most of the characters in ""Friends."" Everybody knows TV togetherness is good for a few laughs and convenient for scriptwriters. But even in today's heated real estate market, some New Yorkers choose to move into the same building as their pals, creating enclaves where it is perfectly appropriate to show up for a get-together in pajamas and slippers. The concept is firmly rooted in history: Immigrants have long rebuilt communities by populating buildings and neighborhoods with extended families. Nevertheless, artificially creating a neighborhood in a single building is not always easy, frequently requiring a healthy dose of serendipity. A suitable unit must be available in the building; an applicant must win the blessing of the landlord or the co-op board; and friends must adhere to a set of social graces so as to live amicably in shouting distance of one another.

For the New Yorkers who make it work, the payoff can be a lot of fun. New York, after all, can be a lonely city, and having your crew an elevator ride away certainly takes the edge off. For parents with small children, the arrangement provides for impromptu play dates and moral support. For retirees, living near friends can mitigate the isolation that can accompany aging. And for recent graduates, moving into a building with a friendly face can extend the college dorm years (assuming, of course, that is a good thing). ""We used to live with extended families. In the tenements there would be multiple generations living together. Now most people are in small apartments by themselves,"" said Irene S. Levine, a clinical professor in the department of psychiatry at New York University Langone Medical Center who has a blog on friendship. ""To have your group nearby gives you some self-confidence -- it makes you feel more connected. It can enhance your life to have that sense of support."" On a Saturday night last March, Catie Abrams realized that she might be able to live in the same building as her boyfriend, two of her college friends and their boyfriends. The three couples had gathered at the Hog Pit, a Flatiron restaurant and bar, to watch a college basketball game. Ms. Abrams and her boyfriend, William McKee, had just returned from a day spent traipsing through the rain looking at rentals. After visiting a few buildings, they had happened upon 388 Bridge, a new luxury tower in Downtown Brooklyn named for its street address, with numerous rentals available. Ms. Abrams could hardly contain her excitement as she passed out floor plans to the group.

""I said, 'You guys have to live in this building,'"" recalled Ms. Abrams, who is 27 and a hedge fund analyst. ""I think everybody was excited."" All three couples were planning to move out of their Manhattan apartments by summer, and although the idea of Brooklyn was appealing -- they could potentially get more space for the money -- it was also unnerving. None of them had lived in Brooklyn before. Each worried that if the others did not follow, he or she could end up living in an unfamiliar borough without friends nearby. ""One of the issues that people my age have about moving to Brooklyn is that you think that the second you live there, you are moving to a foreign country and will never see anyone again,"" said Woody Wright, 27, who grew up on East 58th Street and, at the time of the Hog Pit gathering, was planning to move in with his girlfriend, Britaania Poppie, who is 26 and works in finance. Ms. Abrams's enthusiasm proved infectious. By August, all three couples had moved into one-bedroom apartments at 388 Bridge, paying around $3,200 a month in rent for apartments on the 23rd, 24th and 25th floors.

It is not uncommon for tenants to refer friends to buildings. Of the 234 units at 388 Bridge, 222 had been leased as of a few weeks ago, 11 through friend referrals. Some property management companies and developments, including 388 Bridge, encourage the practice, offering cash bonuses and other perks to tenants who make successful referrals. Related Companies, which manages about 6,000 rental units in the city, receives calls weekly from prospective tenants who were referred by friends, and pays its tenants $1,000 for a successful referral. About 10 percent of those who move into the 11,000 rental units owned and operated in the New York City metro area by Equity Residential come from friend referrals. A friend's endorsement goes a long way. ""They are going to believe their friends before they believe the broker,"" said Pat Publik, an associate broker for Halstead Property. ""If their friend tells them it's a great building, they are going to believe it."" According to brokers and property managers, the practice is more common in newer buildings, which may have several units available at once. But some buildings develop a reputation for their fraternal atmosphere, like the Upper East Side complex Normandie Court, which has long carried the telling nickname Dormandie Court. Some neighborhoods are more referral territory than others. ""Like the Murray Hill area. Everybody knows everybody there,"" said Laurie Zucker, the vice chairwoman of Manhattan Skyline Management Corporation, which gives residents a $1,000 rent credit for a referral. While some boards do not accept recommendation letters from current shareholders, others weigh a shareholder's opinion heavily. ""If the tenant shareholder is a good person known to me or other people on the board, that is a four-star recommendation,"" said Steven R. Wagner, the president of the co-op board of Southgate in Midtown East, and a real estate lawyer. In a tight real estate market, having a friend in the building means ears on the ground. When they came into the city from New Jersey, George and Terri K. Hicks frequently visited their longtime friends, Harvey and Lynne Schmelter-Davis, at their place on West 66th Street near Lincoln Center. ""It became our meeting point for social outings,"" said Ms. Hicks, 66, a retired sociology professor.

When the Schmelter-Davises heard that the unit next door was about to go on the market in 2012, they quickly spread the news. Mr. and Ms. Hicks bought the one-bedroom apartment after viewing it only once -- and without ever embarking on a full-fledged apartment hunt. The arrangement also was a boon for the sellers, who avoided a broker's fee. Ms. Hicks has had no second thoughts about her speedy decision and has decorated the space with midcentury modern furniture, painting the living room in various shades of orange. ""If I open up my bedroom window, I can wave at Lynne in the living room,"" Ms. Hicks said. Like the Hickses, the Schmelter-Davises also have a home in New Jersey. ""Our lives intersect all the time, but we don't have to plan,"" said Mr. Schmelter-Davis, who is 74 and a retired community college administrator. Having a friend next door has other advantages. If Ms. Hicks leaves an important item behind in the city, her neighbors can take it with them to New Jersey. A friend living next door in a large city also provides a psychological benefit. ""It's very comforting to know that there is somebody there,"" Ms. Hicks said. ""If something happened, you could call them."" The Hickses are not alone in their desire to have friends close at hand. Retiring in separate apartments in the same building is one such option, providing seniors with both companionship and autonomy. ""People are getting a lot more proactive about not spending their old age alone,"" said Beth Baker, the author of ""With a Little Help From Our Friends: Creating Community as We Grow Older"" (Vanderbilt University Press, 2014). ""But people want privacy, too. And this gives them both.""

In October, Xiyan Qian, 26, a media planner from Shenzhen, China, moved to Jersey City from Roosevelt Island so she could live near her friend Yezhen Zheng, 28, a graduate student who is also from China. Now the two women live in neighboring buildings in the Newport neighborhood, sharing American and Chinese holidays together, as well as most of their free time. Ms. Qian's father is especially pleased that his daughter lives near friends, a practice that is common in China. ""When you get married, you want to live close with your parents,"" said Ms. Qian, who grew up just one building away from an uncle. ""People always want you in the same building, in the same community."" The Chinese have a saying, she added: One should live near enough to family that if you were to hand-deliver a bowl of soup, it would still be warm when you arrived. ""You want to live that close to each other,"" she said. Soup deliveries aside, maintaining privacy and autonomy when you live on the same elevator bank as your social circle can prove challenging. If three friends call the same address home, can just two of them go out for a movie and dinner? If you don't want to announce to the world that you have a hot date with so-and-so, how do you get around being seen together by your in-building buddy? To avoid awkward moments, ground rules are in order. One common mandate: no unannounced visits. ""If people aren't in sync and they don't establish boundaries, you can wind up in a situation like on 'Seinfeld,' with Kramer dropping in unexpectedly,"" said Dr. Levine, the friendship blogger, referring to the character who makes frequent grand and unwelcome entrances. After all, one of the hallmarks of New York City apartment living is the anonymous neighbor. New Yorkers can live alongside each other for decades without sharing more than a few words -- and many prefer it that way. ""I've been in my building for almost 30 years,"" said Kathy Braddock, a managing director of the New York City office of William Raveis. ""My neighbors are very nice, but we don't say, 'Let's break bread.' "" Living close to friends can strain relationships in other ways. Getting to know a person too well can be a friendship's undoing. ""Do you want your best friend living downstairs from you? Maybe not,"" Ms. Braddock said. If a friendship sours, the future could hold countless uncomfortable encounters in the mailroom.

But as much as New Yorkers treasure anonymity, many bond tightly with their neighbors over the years, turning apartment buildings into de facto neighborhoods. So taking your friends with you to a building may simply speed up an inevitable process. ""It's kind of like we're going back to an older style of living,"" said Jason Turetsky, 29, who works for the Anti-Defamation League and rents a two-bedroom apartment with his wife, Robyn, in the Kalahari, a condo on West 116th Street in Harlem. In June, Mrs. Turetsky's cousin, Richard Gold, and his wife, Micaela, bought a two-bedroom in the Kalahari. ""Having them up here is even better than we could have imagined,"" said Mr. Gold, 31. Now that they live in the same building, their extended families often gravitate to Harlem, with the couples hosting Hanukkah and birthday parties for siblings, parents, aunts and uncles. Ruth and Yigal Gafni, longtime friends of Mrs. Turetsky's parents, recently bought a two-bedroom in the Adeline, a new condo directly across the street. And Mr. Turetsky's brother and his fiancee also live on West 116th Street. ""I like it, it makes me feel like I'm not in a city. I'm in a neighborhood,"" said Mrs. Turetsky, 28, sitting on her cousin's white leather couch in his spacious living room one recent evening. Mrs. Turetsky, a dietitian, was sharing hot cocoa with Mrs. Gold, 30, who is expecting her first child in March. ""It feels comforting to have people around,"" Mrs. Gold said. This month, Mr. and Mrs. Turetsky plan to move into a three-bedroom apartment they bought in the Adeline. After living so close to the Golds, having to cross 116th Street to visit will seem like a trek. ""When they move across the street, I'm actually going to be sad,"" said Mr. Gold, who works for the management consultants McKinsey & Company. ""I literally come up here in my pajamas,"" Mrs. Turetsky said. ""I would never go outside like that.""","Creating a neighborhood within a single New York City building is not always easy, frequently requiring a healthy dose of serendipity.",1ccda169-98a0-5c4d-870e-b1168af36719,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/01/realestate/01COV/01COV-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=09c8828c4abb66df1e5692d514f4db7416d9cc42839a8c92e0d3aaa405fd2ed7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Britaania Poppie, Woody Wright, Sean Oliver, Chrissy Hunt, Catie Abrams and William McKee are friends who moved into apartments in the same building, 388 Bridge in Downtown Brooklyn.",1ccda169-98a0-5c4d-870e-b1168af36719,Demo_data/D1_img2/11ccda169-98a0-5c4d-870e-b1168af36719.jpg,7,"The Gang's All Here Living down the hall from a bosom buddy is the stuff of sitcoms.

Ms. Abrams could hardly contain her excitement as she passed out floor plans to the group.

""I said, 'You guys have to live in this building,'"" recalled Ms. Abrams, who is 27 and a hedge fund analyst. ""I think everybody was excited."" All three couples were planning to move out of their Manhattan apartments by summer, and although the idea of Brooklyn was appealing -- they could potentially get more space for the money -- it was also unnerving. None of them had lived in Brooklyn before. Each worried that if the others did not follow, he or she could end up living in an unfamiliar borough without friends nearby. ""One of the issues that people my age have about moving to Brooklyn is that you think that the second you live there, you are moving to a foreign country and will never see anyone again,"" said Woody Wright, 27, who grew up on East 58th Street and, at the time of the Hog Pit gathering, was planning to move in with his girlfriend, Britaania Poppie, who is 26 and works in finance. Ms. Abrams's enthusiasm proved infectious. By August, all three couples had moved into one-bedroom apartments at 388 Bridge, paying around $3,200 a month in rent for apartments on the 23rd, 24th and 25th floors.

It is not uncommon for tenants to refer friends to buildings. Of the 234 units at 388 Bridge, 222 had been leased as of a few weeks ago, 11 through friend referrals. Some property management companies and developments, including 388 Bridge, encourage the practice, offering cash bonuses and other perks to tenants who make successful referrals. Related Companies, which manages about 6,000 rental units in the city, receives calls weekly from prospective tenants who were referred by friends, and pays its tenants $1,000 for a successful referral. About 10 percent of those who move into the 11,000 rental units owned and operated in the New York City metro area by Equity Residential come from friend referrals. A friend's endorsement goes a long way. ""They are going to believe their friends before they believe the broker,"" said Pat Publik, an associate broker for Halstead Property. ""If their friend tells them it's a great building, they are going to believe it."" According to brokers and property managers, the practice is more common in newer buildings, which may have several units available at once. But some buildings develop a reputation for their fraternal atmosphere, like the Upper East Side complex Normandie Court, which has long carried the telling nickname Dormandie Court. Some neighborhoods are more referral territory than others. ""Like the Murray Hill area. Everybody knows everybody there,"" said Laurie Zucker, the vice chairwoman of Manhattan Skyline Management Corporation, which gives residents a $1,000 rent credit for a referral. While some boards do not accept recommendation letters from current shareholders, others weigh a shareholder's opinion heavily. ""If the tenant shareholder is a good person known to me or other people on the board, that is a four-star recommendation,"" said Steven R. Wagner, the president of the co-op board of Southgate in Midtown East, and a real estate lawyer. In a tight real estate market, having a friend in the building means ears on the ground. When they came into the city from New Jersey, George and Terri K. Hicks frequently visited their longtime friends, Harvey and Lynne Schmelter-Davis, at their place on West 66th Street near Lincoln Center. ""It became our meeting point for social outings,"" said Ms. Hicks, 66, a retired sociology professor.

When the Schmelter-Davises heard that the unit next door was about to go on the market in 2012, they quickly spread the news. Mr. and Ms. Hicks bought the one-bedroom apartment after viewing it only once -- and without ever embarking on a full-fledged apartment hunt. The arrangement also was a boon for the sellers, who avoided a broker's fee. Ms. Hicks has had no second thoughts about her speedy decision and has decorated the space with midcentury modern furniture, painting the living room in various shades of orange. ""If I open up my bedroom window, I can wave at Lynne in the living room,"" Ms. Hicks said. Like the Hickses, the Schmelter-Davises also have a home in New Jersey. ""Our lives intersect all the time, but we don't have to plan,"" said Mr. Schmelter-Davis, who is 74 and a retired community college administrator. Having a friend next door has other advantages. If Ms. Hicks leaves an important item behind in the city, her neighbors can take it with them to New Jersey. A friend living next door in a large city also provides a psychological benefit. ""It's very comforting to know that there is somebody there,"" Ms. Hicks said. ""If something happened, you could call them."" The Hickses are not alone in their desire to have friends close at hand. Retiring in separate apartments in the same building is one such option, providing seniors with both companionship and autonomy. ""People are getting a lot more proactive about not spending their old age alone,"" said Beth Baker, the author of ""With a Little Help From Our Friends: Creating Community as We Grow Older"" (Vanderbilt University Press, 2014). ""But people want privacy, too. And this gives them both.""

In October, Xiyan Qian, 26, a media planner from Shenzhen, China, moved to Jersey City from Roosevelt Island so she could live near her friend Yezhen Zheng, 28, a graduate student who is also from China. Now the two women live in neighboring buildings in the Newport neighborhood, sharing American and Chinese holidays together, as well as most of their free time. Ms. Qian's father is especially pleased that his daughter lives near friends, a practice that is common in China. ""When you get married, you want to live close with your parents,"" said Ms. Qian, who grew up just one building away from an uncle. ""People always want you in the same building, in the same community."" The Chinese have a saying, she added: One should live near enough to family that if you were to hand-deliver a bowl of soup, it would still be warm when you arrived. ""You want to live that close to each other,"" she said. Soup deliveries aside, maintaining privacy and autonomy when you live on the same elevator bank as your social circle can prove challenging. If three friends call the same address home, can just two of them go out for a movie and dinner? If you don't want to announce to the world that you have a hot date with so-and-so, how do you get around being seen together by your in-building buddy? To avoid awkward moments, ground rules are in order. One common mandate: no unannounced visits. ""If people aren't in sync and they don't establish boundaries, you can wind up in a situation like on 'Seinfeld,' with Kramer dropping in unexpectedly,"" said Dr. Levine, the friendship blogger, referring to the character who makes frequent grand and unwelcome entrances. After all, one of the hallmarks of New York City apartment living is the anonymous neighbor. New Yorkers can live alongside each other for decades without sharing more than a few words -- and many prefer it that way. ""I've been in my building for almost 30 years,"" said Kathy Braddock, a managing director of the New York City office of William Raveis. ""My neighbors are very nice, but we don't say, 'Let's break bread.' "" Living close to friends can strain relationships in other ways. Getting to know a person too well can be a friendship's undoing. ""Do you want your best friend living downstairs from you? Maybe not,"" Ms. Braddock said. If a friendship sours, the future could hold countless uncomfortable encounters in the mailroom.

But as much as New Yorkers treasure anonymity, many bond tightly with their neighbors over the years, turning apartment buildings into de facto neighborhoods. So taking your friends with you to a building may simply speed up an inevitable process. ""It's kind of like we're going back to an older style of living,"" said Jason Turetsky, 29, who works for the Anti-Defamation League and rents a two-bedroom apartment with his wife, Robyn, in the Kalahari, a condo on West 116th Street in Harlem. In June, Mrs. Turetsky's cousin, Richard Gold, and his wife, Micaela, bought a two-bedroom in the Kalahari. ""Having them up here is even better than we could have imagined,"" said Mr. Gold, 31. Now that they live in the same building, their extended families often gravitate to Harlem, with the couples hosting Hanukkah and birthday parties for siblings, parents, aunts and uncles. Ruth and Yigal Gafni, longtime friends of Mrs. Turetsky's parents, recently bought a two-bedroom in the Adeline, a new condo directly across the street. And Mr. Turetsky's brother and his fiancee also live on West 116th Street. ""I like it, it makes me feel like I'm not in a city. I'm in a neighborhood,"" said Mrs. Turetsky, 28, sitting on her cousin's white leather couch in his spacious living room one recent evening. Mrs. Turetsky, a dietitian, was sharing hot cocoa with Mrs. Gold, 30, who is expecting her first child in March. ""It feels comforting to have people around,"" Mrs. Gold said. This month, Mr. and Mrs. Turetsky plan to move into a three-bedroom apartment they bought in the Adeline. After living so close to the Golds, having to cross 116th Street to visit will seem like a trek. ""When they move across the street, I'm actually going to be sad,"" said Mr. Gold, who works for the management consultants McKinsey & Company. ""I literally come up here in my pajamas,"" Mrs. Turetsky said. ""I would never go outside like that."" Creating a neighborhood within a single New York City building is not always easy, frequently requiring a healthy dose of serendipity.",,"The Gang's All Here Living down the hall from a bosom buddy is the stuff of sitcoms. Consider Lucy and Ethel in ""I Love Lucy,"" Seinfeld and Kramer in ""Seinfeld,"" or most of the characters in ""Friends."" Everybody knows TV togetherness is good for a few laughs and convenient for scriptwriters. But even in today's heated real estate market, some New Yorkers choose to move into the same building as their pals, creating enclaves where it is perfectly appropriate to show up for a get-together in pajamas and slippers. The concept is firmly rooted in history: Immigrants have long rebuilt communities by populating buildings and neighborhoods with extended families. Nevertheless, artificially creating a neighborhood in a single building is not always easy, frequently requiring a healthy dose of serendipity. A suitable unit must be available in the building; an applicant must win the blessing of the landlord or the co-op board; and friends must adhere to a set of social graces so as to live amicably in shouting distance of one another.

For the New Yorkers who make it work, the payoff can be a lot of fun. New York, after all, can be a lonely city, and having your crew an elevator ride away certainly takes the edge off. For parents with small children, the arrangement provides for impromptu play dates and moral support. For retirees, living near friends can mitigate the isolation that can accompany aging. And for recent graduates, moving into a building with a friendly face can extend the college dorm years (assuming, of course, that is a good thing). ""We used to live with extended families. In the tenements there would be multiple generations living together. Now most people are in small apartments by themselves,"" said Irene S. Levine, a clinical professor in the department of psychiatry at New York University Langone Medical Center who has a blog on friendship. ""To have your group nearby gives you some self-confidence -- it makes you feel more connected. It can enhance your life to have that sense of support."" On a Saturday night last March, Catie Abrams realized that she might be able to live in the same building as her boyfriend, two of her college friends and their boyfriends. The three couples had gathered at the Hog Pit, a Flatiron restaurant and bar, to watch a college basketball game. Ms. Abrams and her boyfriend, William McKee, had just returned from a day spent traipsing through the rain looking at rentals. After visiting a few buildings, they had happened upon 388 Bridge, a new luxury tower in Downtown Brooklyn named for its street address, with numerous rentals available.

Books,The Day the White Working Class Turned Republican,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/books/review/the-hardhat-riot-david-paul-kuhn.html,"THE HARDHAT RIOT

Nixon, New York City, and the Dawn of the White Working-Class Revolution

By David Paul Kuhn The nation, we keep hearing on television and in social media blather, is politically divided as never before. Nonsense. The ostensibly united states have been disunited many, many times, and ""The Hardhat Riot,"" by David Paul Kuhn, vividly evokes an especially ugly moment half a century ago, when the misbegotten Vietnam War and a malformed notion of patriotism combined volatilely. They produced a blue-collar rampage whose effects still ripple, not the least of them being Donald Trump's improbable ascension to the presidency. Let's remember what the United States was like in 1970: a country torn apart after years of political assassination, unpopular war, economic dislocation, race rioting and class disharmony. The last thing it needed in 1970 was more open fighting in the streets. But that's what it got on May 8, days after President Richard Nixon had expanded America's Southeast Asia misadventure into Cambodia and Ohio National Guardsmen shot dead four students during antiwar protests at Kent State University. Kuhn, who has written before about white working-class Americans, builds his book on long-ago police records and witness statements to recreate in painful detail a May day of rage, menace and blood. Antiwar demonstrators had massed at Federal Hall and other Lower Manhattan locations, only to be set upon brutally, and cravenly, by hundreds of steamfitters, ironworkers, plumbers and other laborers from nearby construction sites like the nascent World Trade Center. Many of those men had served in past wars and viscerally despised the protesters as a bunch of pampered, longhaired, draft-dodging, flag-desecrating snotnoses.

It was a clash of irreconcilable tribes and battle cries: ""We don't want your war"" versus ""America, love it or leave it."" And it was bewildering to millions of other Americans, including my younger self, newly back home after a two-year Army stretch, most of it in West Germany. My sympathies were with the demonstrators. But I also understood the working stiffs and why they felt held in contempt by the youngsters and popular culture. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books?

New social policies like affirmative action and school busing affected white blue-collar families far more than they did the more privileged classes that spawned many antiwar activists. For Hollywood, the workingman seemed barely a step above a Neanderthal, as in the 1970 movies ""Joe,"" about a brutish factory worker, and ""Five Easy Pieces,"" in which a diner waitress is set up to be the target of audience scorn. (Come 1971, we also had ""All in the Family"" and television's avatar of working-class bigotry, Archie Bunker.) It was, too, an era when New York was changing fast and not for the better. Corporations decamped for the suburbs and warm-weather states. Kuhn notes how between 1967 and 1974 the number of Fortune 500 headquarters in the city fell to 98 from 139. Whites moved out in droves. Crime rose, and if you proposed getting tough on felons you risked being labeled a racist. Roughly one in three city residents was on public assistance. Municipal finances were in tatters. In short, 1970 New York was a caldron of misery, one rare bright spot being its basketball team, the Knicks, neatly integrated and en route to its first championship. Kuhn quotes the estimable Pete Hamill as observing back then that the workingman ""feels trapped and, even worse, in a society that purports to be democratic, ignored."" One could go further. Many blue-collar workers felt scorned -- by the wealthy, by the college-educated, by the lucky ones with draft deferments, by every group that qualified as elite. They sneered back, especially at the patrician New York mayor. The way many of them referred to Lindsay, you'd have thought his first name was not John but, rather, an all-too-familiar obscenity. Understanding hard-hat resentment, however, does not translate into excusing the violence that hundreds of them inflicted that May 8, the 25th anniversary of the Allied victory over Germany in World War II. Self-styled paragons of law and order, they became a mob, pounding and kicking any antiwar youngster they could grab, doing the same to bystanders who tried to stop the mayhem and justifying it in the name of America. Kuhn ably and amply documents the cowardly beating of women, the gratuitous cold-cocking of men and the storming of a shakily protected City Hall, where the mayor's people, to the hard hats' rage, had lowered the flag in honor of the Kent State dead.

""A tribal tension had infused downtown,"" Kuhn observes. Among the tribes were the police, who were anything but New York's finest that day. Mostly, they stood aside while the hard hats ran amok; examples of their nonfeasance abound. Some of them even egged on the thuggery. When a group of hard hats moved menacingly toward a Wall Street plaza, a patrolman shouted: ""Give 'em hell, boys. Give 'em one for me!"" Yet the police were never held accountable for failing to stop the marauding, and ""few hard hats owned up to the extent of their violence."" Kuhn favors straightforward journalistic prose, with few grand flourishes. In setting scenes, he tends toward a staccato, some of it overdone: One speaker ""exuded Establishment. The jacket and tie. A WASP face with a Roman nose. The side-swept hair, straight and trim with delicate bangs, a tidy mustache, pinkish skin."" Hardly every antiwar protester merits his go-to characterization of them as potty-mouthed hippies. But over all, this is a compelling narrative about a horrific day. In their fury, the hard hats left more than 100 wounded, the typical victim being a 22-year-old white male collegian, though one in four was a woman; seven police officers were also hurt. Kuhn concludes that while the workers plainly came loaded for bear, their tantrum was essentially spontaneous and not, as some believed, part of a grand conspiracy. That said, they were just what some conservative strategists were looking for. Patrick Buchanan, then a Nixon aide, said of blue-collar Americans in a memo to the boss, ""These, quite candidly, are our people now."" He wasn't wrong. Republicans have since catered as ever to the rich but they have also curried favor with working-class whites, while Democrats seem more focused on others: racial minorities, gays, immigrants. Thanks in good measure to white blue-collar disaffection, Trump in 2016 narrowly won Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, a hat trick he may yet pull off again in November. In a way, Vietnam continues to cast its shadow. A short walk from those 1970 streets of chaos, there is a memorial to the 1,741 New Yorkers who died in the war. Its dominant feature is a wall of thick glass etched with reflections on combat, including part of a haunting letter sent home from Vietnam in 1968. ""One thing worries me -- will people believe me?"" The Navy lieutenant Richard W. Strandberg wrote. ""Will they want to hear about it, or will they want to forget the whole thing ever happened?"" Indeed, most Americans forgot about Vietnam long ago. The same has been true about the shameful hard-hat riot of 1970. Until now.","David Paul Kuhn's ""The Hardhat Riot"" recounts a little-remembered event and traces its significance to the politics of the present day.",43072cc6-2f21-5cec-975b-f1b63a214669,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/19/books/review/19Haberman-sub/00Haberman-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=9cacec60e532c140184c4f344f0f0884a713ea0ce1413004308cdc11dd0e8a28&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"New York construction workers, May 8, 1970.",43072cc6-2f21-5cec-975b-f1b63a214669,Demo_data/D1_img2/143072cc6-2f21-5cec-975b-f1b63a214669.jpg,13,"The Day the White Working Class Turned Republican THE HARDHAT RIOT

Nixon, New York City, and the Dawn of the White Working-Class Revolution

By David Paul Kuhn The nation, we keep hearing on television and in social media blather, is politically divided as never before. Nonsense. The ostensibly united states have been disunited many, many times, and ""The Hardhat Riot,"" by David Paul Kuhn, vividly evokes an especially ugly moment half a century ago, when the misbegotten Vietnam War and a malformed notion of patriotism combined volatilely. They produced a blue-collar rampage whose effects still ripple, not the least of them being Donald Trump's improbable ascension to the presidency. Let's remember what the United States was like in 1970: a country torn apart after years of political assassination, unpopular war, economic dislocation, race rioting and class disharmony. The last thing it needed in 1970 was more open fighting in the streets. But that's what it got on May 8, days after President Richard Nixon had expanded America's Southeast Asia misadventure into Cambodia and Ohio National Guardsmen shot dead four students during antiwar protests at Kent State University. Kuhn, who has written before about white working-class Americans, builds his book on long-ago police records and witness statements to recreate in painful detail a May day of rage, menace and blood. Antiwar demonstrators had massed at Federal Hall and other Lower Manhattan locations, only to be set upon brutally, and cravenly, by hundreds of steamfitters, ironworkers, plumbers and other laborers from nearby construction sites like the nascent World Trade Center. Many of those men had served in past wars and viscerally despised the protesters as a bunch of pampered, longhaired, draft-dodging, flag-desecrating snotnoses.

It was a clash of irreconcilable tribes and battle cries: ""We don't want your war"" versus ""America, love it or leave it."" And it was bewildering to millions of other Americans, including my younger self, newly back home after a two-year Army stretch, most of it in West Germany. My sympathies were with the demonstrators. But I also understood the working stiffs and why they felt held in contempt by the youngsters and popular culture. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

Lindsay Dina wasn't fooled by a photo on Facebook that supposedly showed masses of dolphins frolicking in the canals of Venice. Ms. Dina, 75, ventured onto the social media platform roughly a decade ago, and has developed some savvy. She mostly shares information from established news organizations. She has deleted posts making bizarre claims about Hillary Clinton. She knows how to use Snopes.com, the fact-checking site. Still, she said, ""I've seen things and thought, 'Well, that's not true.'"" But I wasn't sure how to verify that it wasn't."" To Ms. Dina, a retiree in Easton, Conn., the internet can still feel like a hazardous place. Twice, online scammers have relieved her of small sums of money. She sometimes clicks on an apparent news story, she said, ""but it turns out they're selling some Medicare plan.""

A true-blue Democrat, she has passed along political stories from CNN and NBC but also posts from Impeach Trump, whose sponsoring organization has earned poor truthfulness ratings from PolitiFact. So Ms. Dina was delighted to learn that MediaWise for Seniors, a project of the Poynter Institute, has offered free online courses to help older Americans detect and combat online misinformation. She enrolled and begins her training in a couple of weeks. The MediaWise digital literacy program, which began in 2018 with funding from Google, initially focused on teenagers and college students. Recently, said Katy Byron, the program manager, ""we chose to make a big demographic jump."" ""There was a desperate need to educate this older age group, not only because of the election but because of the coronavirus,"" she said. The online behavior of older Americans during the last presidential campaign alarmed scientists who study communications, politics and technology.

Consider what happened in 2016 on Facebook, the platform that adults over 65 are most likely to use. Researchers from Princeton and New York University determined that sharing articles from ""fake news"" sources -- outlets that propagate false or misleading content masquerading as legitimate news -- was rare. But those who did engage with such outlets were far more likely to be older than 65. That cohort shared twice as many articles from phony sites as 45- to 65-year-olds and nearly seven times as many articles as the youngest group. A study of Twitter during the final month of the 2016 campaign similarly found that fake news purveyors amounted to a small share of all the political sources in an individual's feed -- about 1 percent. But older users were much more likely to engage with fake sources, and those over 50 were overrepresented among the ""supersharers"" responsible for disseminating 80 percent of fake content. Such findings stirred particular concern because older adults are far more likely to register and vote than younger cohorts. In the 2016 election, more than 70 percent of people over 65 cast ballots, compared with about 46 percent of those 18 to 29. ""They have an outsized effect on our democracy,"" Nadia Brashier, a psychologist and neuroscientist at Harvard University said of older adults. And that group is at highest risk for illness from the coronavirus, a subject also generating lots of online distortion and conspiracy theories. Dr. Brashier rejects the notion that older people's participation in misinformation stems from age-related cognitive losses. ""Outside the social media environment, we often see that older adults are more discerning than younger ones,"" she said, pointing to studies showing that older people could more accurately distinguish false headlines and articles from true ones.

Moreover, Dr. Brashier said, ""older adults have a lot more knowledge, facts about the world, especially political facts."" That helps them resist false claims that contradict what they know, she said. But on social media platforms, it's a different story. Although many older adults use those platforms quite adeptly, Dr. Brashier said, ""there seems to be something specific about scrolling through Facebook or Twitter"" that makes them more vulnerable to misinformation. Why might that be? Jeff Hancock, a psychologist at Stanford University, noted that many older users had flocked to such sites only within the past five or six years. ""Online, they have a lot less experience and are less likely to know what's dangerous,"" he said. ""These are extraordinarily complex mechanisms that use machine learning -- sophisticated technology -- with billions of new inputs every day. There's a learning process."" Besides, ""they were targets,"" Dr. Hancock said of older users. As an experiment, he regularly asks the 80 undergraduates and grad students in his ""Truth, Trust and Tech"" course to spend 15 minutes looking for misinformation in their social media feeds, primarily Instagram, a platform with a young demographic. They find very little. But political organizations, foreign propagandists and financial fraudsters have all come after seniors, who are more politically engaged than younger groups and control more wealth as well. Studies have also shown that they are generally more trusting. One could argue that the task of stemming online deception should fall to the extremely profitable tech companies. ""The platforms need to do more,"" said Ms. Byron of MediaWise. ""A whack-a-mole approach is not enough."" In the meantime, digital literacy organizations are quickly ramping up efforts to inoculate older Americans against misinformation. Early research has shown that such interventions can improve people's ability to distinguish between mainstream news headlines and false news.

The MediaWise for Seniors program will offer two free online courses, funded in large part by, well, Facebook. The first four-week course has already filled up, but students can still enroll in a self-directed course on separating online fact from fiction. Hosted by Christiane Amanpour and Joan Lunden, it is scheduled to begin Oct. 1. ""By the end, they'll be using the techniques used by fact-checkers across the world,"" including reverse image searches to determine the sources of photos and videos, said Alex Mahadevan, senior multimedia reporter at Poynter. In addition, Poynter has worked with AARP to produce Fact Tracker interactive videos on spotting and filtering misinformation. The News Literacy Project is also expanding beyond its initial target audience of middle and high school students. Although the project is aiming its new efforts at the general population, ""our hope is that older adults will be major consumers of these resources and become part of the information solution, instead of the misinformation problem,"" said Alan Miller, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who founded the project in 2008. Take its free site called Checkology. ""It gives you a grounding in how to discern credible information,"" Mr. Miller said. ""It helps people detect the difference between news, opinion and propaganda."" Students will also learn about quality journalism interactively, by playing the role of a reporter gathering information on deadline and an editor deciding which stories merit the front page. A weekly newsletter, Get Smart About News, will take aim at current rumors, hoaxes and conspiracy theories, starting Sept. 22. In a game app called Informable, players advance through increasingly challenging levels to develop fact-checking and other digital literacy skills. Simultaneously, public service ads will appear on radio and TV stations and on Facebook.

But resources have emerged to help them learn to discern true from false.",,"Getting Wise to Fake News Lindsay Dina takes an online course that helps older people spot online misinformation. ""I've seen things and thought, 'Well, that's not true,'"" she said. ""But I wasn't sure how to verify that it wasn't.""





Lindsay Dina wasn't fooled by a photo on Facebook that supposedly showed masses of dolphins frolicking in the canals of Venice. Ms. Dina, 75, ventured onto the social media platform roughly a decade ago, and has developed some savvy. She mostly shares information from established news organizations. She has deleted posts making bizarre claims about Hillary Clinton. She knows how to use Snopes.com, the fact-checking site. Still, she said, ""I've seen things and thought, 'Well, that's not true.'"" But I wasn't sure how to verify that it wasn't."" To Ms. Dina, a retiree in Easton, Conn., the internet can still feel like a hazardous place. Twice, online scammers have relieved her of small sums of money. She sometimes clicks on an apparent news story, she said, ""but it turns out they're selling some Medicare plan.""

A true-blue Democrat, she has passed along political stories from CNN and NBC but also posts from Impeach Trump, whose sponsoring organization has earned poor truthfulness ratings from PolitiFact. So Ms. Dina was delighted to learn that MediaWise for Seniors, a project of the Poynter Institute, has offered free online courses to help older Americans detect and combat online misinformation. She enrolled and begins her training in a couple of weeks. The MediaWise digital literacy program, which began in 2018 with funding from Google, initially focused on teenagers and college students. Recently, said Katy Byron, the program manager, ""we chose to make a big demographic jump."" ""There was a desperate need to educate this older age group, not only because of the election but because of the coronavirus,"" she said. The online behavior of older Americans during the last presidential campaign alarmed scientists who study communications, politics and technology.

Consider what happened in 2016 on Facebook, the platform that adults over 65 are most likely to use. Researchers from Princeton and New York University determined that sharing articles from ""fake news"" sources -- outlets that propagate false or misleading content masquerading as legitimate news -- was rare. But those who did engage with such outlets were far more likely to be older than 65. That cohort shared twice as many articles from phony sites as 45- to 65-year-olds and nearly seven times as many articles as the youngest group. A study of Twitter during the final month of the 2016 campaign similarly found that fake news purveyors amounted to a small share of all the political sources in an individual's feed -- about 1 percent. But older users were much more likely to engage with fake sources, and those over 50 were overrepresented among the ""supersharers"" responsible for disseminating 80 percent of fake content. Such findings stirred particular concern because older adults are far more likely to register and vote than younger cohorts. In the 2016 election, more than 70 percent of people over 65 cast ballots, compared with about 46 percent of those 18 to 29. ""They have an outsized effect on our democracy,"" Nadia Brashier, a psychologist and neuroscientist at Harvard University said of older adults. And that group is at highest risk for illness from the coronavirus, a subject also generating lots of online distortion and conspiracy theories. Dr. Brashier rejects the notion that older people's participation in misinformation stems from age-related cognitive losses. ""Outside the social media environment, we often see that older adults are more discerning than younger ones,"" she said, pointing to studies showing that older people could more accurately distinguish false headlines and articles from true ones.

Moreover, Dr. Brashier said, ""older adults have a lot more knowledge, facts about the world, especially political facts."" That helps them resist false claims that contradict what they know, she said. But on social media platforms, it's a different story. Although many older adults use those platforms quite adeptly, Dr. Brashier said, ""there seems to be something specific about scrolling through Facebook or Twitter"" that makes them more vulnerable to misinformation. Why might that be? Jeff Hancock, a psychologist at Stanford University, noted that many older users had flocked to such sites only within the past five or six years. ""Online, they have a lot less experience and are less likely to know what's dangerous,"" he said. ""These are extraordinarily complex mechanisms that use machine learning -- sophisticated technology -- with billions of new inputs every day. There's a learning process."" Besides, ""they were targets,"" Dr. Hancock said of older users. As an experiment, he regularly asks the 80 undergraduates and grad students in his ""Truth, Trust and Tech"" course to spend 15 minutes looking for misinformation in their social media feeds, primarily Instagram, a platform with a young demographic. They find very little. But political organizations, foreign propagandists and financial fraudsters have all come after seniors, who are more politically engaged than younger groups and control more wealth as well. Studies have also shown that they are generally more trusting. One could argue that the task of stemming online deception should fall to the extremely profitable tech companies. ""The platforms need to do more,"" said Ms. Byron of MediaWise. ""A whack-a-mole approach is not enough."" In the meantime, digital literacy organizations are quickly ramping up efforts to inoculate older Americans against misinformation. Early research has shown that such interventions can improve people's ability to distinguish between mainstream news headlines and false news.

The MediaWise for Seniors program will offer two free online courses, funded in large part by, well, Facebook. The first four-week course has already filled up, but students can still enroll in a self-directed course on separating online fact from fiction. Hosted by Christiane Amanpour and Joan Lunden, it is scheduled to begin Oct. 1. ""By the end, they'll be using the techniques used by fact-checkers across the world,"" including reverse image searches to determine the sources of photos and videos, said Alex Mahadevan, senior multimedia reporter at Poynter. In addition, Poynter has worked with AARP to produce Fact Tracker interactive videos on spotting and filtering misinformation. The News Literacy Project is also expanding beyond its initial target audience of middle and high school students. Although the project is aiming its new efforts at the general population, ""our hope is that older adults will be major consumers of these resources and become part of the information solution, instead of the misinformation problem,"" said Alan Miller, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who founded the project in 2008. Take its free site called Checkology. ""It gives you a grounding in how to discern credible information,"" Mr. Miller said. ""It helps people detect the difference between news, opinion and propaganda."" Students will also learn about quality journalism interactively, by playing the role of a reporter gathering information on deadline and an editor deciding which stories merit the front page. A weekly newsletter, Get Smart About News, will take aim at current rumors, hoaxes and conspiracy theories, starting Sept. 22. In a game app called Informable, players advance through increasingly challenging levels to develop fact-checking and other digital literacy skills. Simultaneously, public service ads will appear on radio and TV stations and on Facebook.

Although all of these efforts remain small in scale, their supporters say they can quickly be expanded to reach larger audiences. They hope that once educated, their older graduates will be able not only to counter online manipulation but to persuade other seniors to join the fight. ""We can send them out as ambassadors in their communities,"" Mr. Mahadevan said. ""When they go to church and hear someone talk about the latest meme, they can say, 'You might want to think about that for a moment.'""

Food,"Make a Compound Butter, and Use It on Your Next Meal",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/dining/compound-butter-recipe-coronavirus.html,"Put it in a bowl and season it to your heart's content, starting with  1/4  teaspoon each freshly ground black pepper and kosher salt (or if you use salted butter, you can skip the salt). Add in 2 tablespoons chopped fresh herbs (any herbs, a combination keeps things interesting, bite after bite). Squeeze in a few drops of lemon or lime juice, or add a tiny drizzle of mild vinegar like white wine or cider.

I also like to use a bit of allium, either 1 tablespoon of something onion-y (shallot, scallion, leek, any kind of onion) or a grated garlic clove. You can even use both onion and garlic, though it will turn out on the more pungent side.

You can stop here, or you can continue to play, mixing in a little of any of the following: minced anchovies, smoked salmon, sardines or smoked trout; a drizzle of Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce or fish sauce; grated citrus zest; grated or crumbled cheese like Gorgonzola, Parmesan or feta; ground spices like coriander, cumin, turmeric, fennel seeds or chile powder; a dash of hot sauce, chile paste, mustard or pomegranate molasses; minced olives, capers, pickled peppers or preserved lemons. If you need inspiration, just stare into the depths of your condiment collection for a while. Something will occur to you.

Squeeze in a few drops of lemon or lime juice, or add a tiny drizzle of mild vinegar like white wine or cider.

You can stop here, or you can continue to play, mixing in a little of any of the following: minced anchovies, smoked salmon, sardines or smoked trout; a drizzle of Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce or fish sauce; grated citrus zest; grated or crumbled cheese like Gorgonzola, Parmesan or feta; ground spices like coriander, cumin, turmeric, fennel seeds or chile powder; a dash of hot sauce, chile paste, mustard or pomegranate molasses; minced olives, capers, pickled peppers or preserved lemons. If you need inspiration, just stare into the depths of your condiment collection for a while. Something will occur to you.

Music,"Malik B., Longtime Member of the Roots, Is Dead at 47",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/arts/music/malik-b-dead.html,"Malik B., the elusive M.C. best known for his work with the Roots, died on Wednesday. He was 47.

His death was confirmed by his cousin Don Champion. Members of the Roots also posted public statements on their Instagram and Twitter accounts, though the statements did not say where he died or specify the cause.

Malik joined the hip-hop group then known as the Square Roots after he met the founders, Questlove (Ahmir Thompson) and Black Thought (Tariq Trotter), in 1991 at Millersville University in rural Millersville, Pa. By 1993, the Roots had dropped ""Square"" from their name and self-released their debut album, ""Organix."" Touring relentlessly, they soon developed a cult following in Europe.

New members filtered in and out each year. Malik appeared on three more albums -- ""Do You Want More?!!!??!"" (1995), ""Illadelph Halflife"" (1996) and ""Things Fall Apart"" (1999) -- and then left the band.

Before his departure, the Roots were churning out critically acclaimed albums and inching further into the hip-hop mainstream. Collaborating with artists like D'Angelo, Common and Erykah Badu, the Roots made their name merging the seemingly disparate worlds of live jazz and gritty East Coast rap.","He brought his understatedly gritty lyrics and cadence to the band during its formative years.

Style,Everyone's Playing Among Us,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/style/among-us.html,"When an indie game company created Among Us in 2018, it was greeted with little fanfare. The multiplayer game remained under the radar as many games do -- until the summer of the pandemic. Eager to keep viewers entertained during quarantine, Chance Morris, known online as Sodapoppin, began streaming the game, created by InnerSloth, to his 2.8 million followers on Twitch in July. By mid-September, Among Us caught on like wildfire. Suddenly major YouTube stars, TikTok influencers and streamers were playing it. PewDiePie, James Charles and Dr. Lupo have all played the game for millions.

Crewmates must run around the ship and try to complete a set of tasks while trying to root out and avoid getting killed by the one or several impostors. Players can be voted off the ship, so each game becomes one of survival: Successfully vote off the impostors, or complete all your tasks to win. It's simple, cartoony and easy enough for a five-year-old to play on an iPhone. The young fans of online influencers weren't just watching Among Us streams, they began playing the game too. Millions of teenagers and kids across the country have become hooked on Among Us, which has begun to serve as a default social platform for young people stuck in quarantine. ""A few weeks ago I went from not hearing anything about it to hearing everything about it everywhere,"" said Judah Rice, 16, a high school student in Texas. ""People are texting about it, I know people who are on dedicated Discord servers and Among Us group chats. I have friends who get together all the time and play it."" Among Us Discord servers began cropping up in early September. In one, more than 98,000 teenagers connect, socialize, discuss and play the game. Benson, a 13-year-old administrator of the server, said that there are often 30 to 40 different Among Us games at any time of day happening over voice chat channels in the server. ""Everyone is aged 13 to 20,"" he said. ""My friends, if their teacher doesn't show up to their online class, they play, it's a way to pass the time when you don't have anything else to do. Since we can't really congregate in a public area like the park, Among Us allows us to be online social distancing.""

Among Us is very different than other highly social video games like Fortnite, for instance. It's more similar to a board game like Monopoly, or a party game like Werewolf, where players need to read personalities and determine if they're being lied to in order to win. The large group size makes it easy to invite new friends into the group. ""You can meet a lot of people from Among Us, I've made a few friends off of it,"" said Juan Alonso Flores, 17, a high school student in Florida. ""Once you start playing with the same people you start getting to know each other. You get their phone numbers, Discord tags.""

It's not just teenagers who are bonding over the game. Adults who can no longer hit a bar or swing by a party after work are also finding community through Among Us. Ricky Hayberg, 36, writer and host of Internet Today, a culture and tech YouTube channel, said he's developed stronger friendships with people he met through playing Among Us over the past two months than those he's known offline for years. ""There's more natural conversation that arises from it. It's more of a party game. You're kind of just hanging out with friends and the game is secondary,"" Mr. Hayberg said. ""To excel at the game, you have to know if people are lying, telling the truth and their general personality."" The game's continued success is further propelled by a never-ending stream of Among Us-related content on the internet. Twitter accounts like No Context Among Us and Among Us Struggle Tweets publish memes about the game to hundreds of thousands of followers. Videos on TikTok including the Among Us hashtag have amassed more than 13 billion views.

Throughout the game's ascendance, streamers on Twitch continue to power it all. ""If anyone had any doubt that Twitch streamers were influencers before now, we've proven that to be true,"" said Erin Wayne, director of community and creator marketing at Twitch. Twitch fans have watched more than 200 million hours worth of Among Us gameplay on the platform so far this year. Nathan Grayson, a writer at gaming site Kotaku, said that the game was uniquely designed in a way that makes it far more entertaining to watch than your average first person shooter game. Viewers get to see influencers let their guards down and express how they really are. ""The game is about deception and the personalities of people playing,"" Mr. Grayson said. ""It brings back the spirit of being around your friends. It's designed for streamers to play off one another and they can also have streams where all of them are streaming on separate channels with their audiences speculating on chat about which person is an impostor."" Phil Jamesson, 28, a comedian who streams on Twitch, said that the game is similar to a series like ""Hot Ones,"" where fans get to see their favorite celebrities drop the facade as they struggle to tolerate increasingly spicy chicken wings.","YouTubers, influencers and streamers popularized Among Us, a multiplayer game.

Theater,Review: 'Bernie and Mikey's Trip to the Moon' Is Old-School Drama,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/theater/bernie-and-mikeys-trip-to-the-moon-review.html,"At first glance it's hard to tell when ""Bernie and Mikey's Trip to the Moon"" takes place. The set's tired kitchen and living room could have been lifted from any of the past six decades. The characters' clothing is unburdened by fashion trends. Elvis Presley is playing. We could be watching ""The Honeymooners"" or ""Roseanne.""

Scott Aiello's play, which just opened at 59E59 Theaters in Manhattan, passingly establishes that we are in the 1990s -- the clunky corded phone helps -- but avoids references to the news, technology or pop culture. The focus stays tight on the working-class Vincolo family as they negotiate life with an intellectually disabled daughter in a Chicago suburb: Bernie, now in her 20s and still playing in a sandbox.

Bernie (Stephanie Gould), alternately docile and demanding, rude and sweet, stubborn and accommodating, sets the pace of the Vincolos' existence. Her perpetually harried mother, Gladys (Margo Singaliese), is the very picture of long-suffering grit, busying herself making what we suspect is a bottomless supply of pasta and gravy -- this is an Italian-American brood, after all -- while her father, Mike Sr. (Jordan Lage), finds an escape tending his bar, the Scorpio Lounge.

Economy,Trump Pitches Coronavirus-Related Stimulus Package on Capitol Hill,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/business/economy/coronavirus-fema-trump.html,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump took his pitch for a coronavirus-related economic stimulus package to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, joining Senate Republicans over lunch to discuss cutting payroll taxes, offering targeted relief to tourism and hospitality industries, and other possible steps to lift economic growth. After the meeting, a Senate aide said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California would take the lead on negotiating a bipartisan package. Mr. Trump emerged from his lunch with no new details to share on the package, which remained in flux throughout the day on Tuesday, amid internal struggles at the White House and a cool reception among congressional Republicans to the temporary payroll tax cuts that the president has floated. Mr. Trump said the payroll tax cut and other ideas were discussed, adding that ""there's great unity within the Republican Party."" He acknowledged there was not yet a consensus on how to proceed but expressed confidence that the economy would endure.

""Be calm,"" he said from Capitol Hill, after speaking with lawmakers. ""The consumer has never been in a better position than they are now."" Mr. Trump and his advisers are also considering using the Federal Emergency Management Agency as a vehicle to deliver funds to stimulate the economy, a move that could allow the administration to begin bolstering growth without waiting for Congress. The president could approve major disaster declarations in a growing number of states that have seen coronavirus outbreaks, according to officials in the administration and in Congress. Such approvals would allow FEMA to begin distributing aid to affected individuals, such as emergency food stamps, and to states and local governments for efforts including ""emergency protective measures."" The idea is one of many options being proposed to help alleviate economic strain from a virus that is quarantining workers and consumers, scuttling vacations, closing factories and causing other disruptions. Lobbyists in Washington suggested that several possible plans were under consideration on Tuesday, including tax credits for companies that retain employees who are unable to work because of quarantines and the possibility of allowing firms to delay paying a portion of their estimated quarterly corporate tax bills until the spread of the virus -- and its economic effects -- subside.

Other possibilities included temporarily suspending some excise taxes, such as the 7.5 percent tax airlines pay to the Federal Aviation Administration; increasing community development block grants; and fixing an error in the 2017 Republican tax overhaul that makes it more expensive for restaurant owners to do renovations.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Mr. Trump previewed several ideas at a news conference on Monday evening, but discussions remain in flux and many of the proposals would require congressional approval at a time of deep partisan ire and with the 2020 election looming. The idea of a payroll tax cut in particular has divided Mr. Trump's advisers, with Mr. Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, expressing concerns about the cost, whether it would address the problems caused by the virus and what Democrats would demand if they reopen the tax code. However, Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump's trade adviser, has been a proponent of the idea, and Mr. Trump has been pushing for it to be included in a package of options. Mr. Navarro has often been at odds with Mr. Trump's other economic advisers over trade policy. His appearance with the coronavirus task force at Mr. Trump's White House briefing on Monday raised eyebrows among some officials who wondered if he had inserted himself into the fiscal stimulus discussion. Mr. Navarro said in an interview that he was there at the president's request. ""The president specifically asked during the Oval meeting that I, by name, and other members of his economic and trade team stand with him on the podium, and I left when the president left,"" Mr. Navarro said. Leaders in the Democratic-controlled House have also reacted with skepticism to the payroll tax plan. They have pushed for the administration instead to ramp up spending on the public health response to the virus.

One area of agreement among Republicans and Democrats is the need for any package to include government-provided sick pay to workers who are unable to perform their jobs as a result of quarantines or caring for children whose schools are canceled over virus fears. It is unclear how such a program would work and how it would ramp up fast enough to prevent affected workers from missing payments on rent, credit cards or other bills. Markets rallied on Tuesday morning on news of the stimulus request, after suffering steep losses Monday. But several congressional aides cautioned it will most likely take weeks, at minimum, to complete and approve any stimulus bill. The White House is also considering other plans that would not require congressional action, such as allowing tax payments to be deferred. Mr. Trump said on Monday that the White House would hold another news conference at some point on Tuesday laying out stimulus measures in more detail. While his advisers worked on the package, Mr. Trump on Tuesday called the Federal Reserve ""pathetic"" for keeping interest rates too high, renewing a regular gripe as coronavirus spreads both globally and domestically, roiling markets and threatening the economic outlook. ""Our pathetic, slow moving Federal Reserve, headed by Jay Powell, who raised rates too fast and lowered too late, should get our Fed Rate down to the levels of our competitor nations,"" he tweeted.

Food,Hot Grapes and Liver: Outtakes From an Australian Restaurant Critic,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/dining/australia-restaurants-food-critic.html,"Many spots don't make the cut -- but some are still worth visiting.

This is a job that leaves a lot of outtakes in its wake. For every restaurant that ends up being featured in Australia Fare, five or 10 or 20 meals were eaten in pursuit of that one column. The restaurants I cover should ideally reveal something greater about Australia: a story that has not been told, an unexamined angle. These are restaurant reviews, but they are also cultural essays, culinary investigations -- snapshots of this country and the people in it. I eat many great meals that don't quite encapsulate a particular Australian experience or phenomenon enough to warrant a full column. (I've had some pretty mediocre food as well, but that's for another day.) Yet weeks or months later, I find myself thinking about a dish, a meal, a place. It seems a waste to keep these to myself, the fantastic dishes and wonderful little finds. Here are four of those experiences that have stuck with me.

Victoria Parade, in Melbourne, is known for its pho houses, but another noodle lured me to this part of town. Oneyada Thai Cafe is an adorably colorful little shopfront, serving Thai breakfast and lunch. It opened in 2016 as an offshoot of the nearby and well-known Jinda Thai, owned by the Tanapat family. The breakfast dishes here are great, but it is their khao soi gai that haunts me. The northern Thai egg noodle curry soup is one of those dishes that can easily become an obsession, and it is hard to find in Australia at all, let alone a version this good.

Oneyada's is just about perfect: creamy coconut curry with a warming spice kick, chewy egg noodles, hunks of on-the-bone chicken pieces, fistfuls of chopped scallions and cilantro and red onion and fried shallots. The fresh crunch of all those different kinds of oniony bits and herbs cuts through the rich broth so beautifully it makes me a little emotional.

This restaurant reminded me of lots of places, none of them having much in common with its home in Gold Coast, Queensland. Lupo's location, in the crook of a strip mall behind a building on a highway, conjures Los Angeles. Its design has the feeling of a European cafe dropped into the middle of the tropics: lace curtains, burnished walls, copper bar, fans rotating warm ocean air. The soundtrack was awesome: Otis Redding leading into ""Sandinista!"" by the Clash. The menu looked like a lot of menus at a lot of new Australian restaurants these days -- everyone seems to have a kingfish ceviche and a steak (or lamb, or emu) tartare.

But Lupo excels at turning those tropes on their head, particularly the steak tartare. Here it is served as a steak sandwich, but the bread is in the form of thin, intensely crispy crostini, which is then doused in very good Spanish paprika. I'm not talking about a sprinkle here, I mean a literal pile of paprika. It sounds concerning, but it is an overkill that works -- and that I'm still thinking about months later.

A lovely restaurant in North Fremantle -- just south of Perth -- Propeller serves smart, modern Middle Eastern food . I had an exceedingly pleasant meal there, next to a brick wall dripping with ivy, but most of the food blended in my memory with many other modern Middle Eastern meals I've had in Australia and Los Angeles and elsewhere. All of it, that is, except one dish: a jumble of chicken livers cooked simply and perfectly in a piquant vinegar molasses combination and tossed with fat green and red grapes.

The grapes had obviously seen a hint of the hot pan, but not so much that they lost their structural, juicy integrity. The richness of the pink livers with the bawdy fruit is one of those combinations that seems so elemental I am surprised this is my first grape-liver encounter. Perhaps ""hot grapes and liver"" doesn't sound particularly appealing.

Perhaps ""hot grapes and liver"" doesn't sound particularly appealing. But believe me, hot grapes and liver is awesome. Many spots don't make the cut — but some are still worth visiting.",,"Hot Grapes and Liver: Outtakes From an Australian Restaurant Critic Many spots don't make the cut -- but some are still worth visiting.

This is a job that leaves a lot of outtakes in its wake. For every restaurant that ends up being featured in Australia Fare, five or 10 or 20 meals were eaten in pursuit of that one column. The restaurants I cover should ideally reveal something greater about Australia: a story that has not been told, an unexamined angle. These are restaurant reviews, but they are also cultural essays, culinary investigations -- snapshots of this country and the people in it. I eat many great meals that don't quite encapsulate a particular Australian experience or phenomenon enough to warrant a full column. (I've had some pretty mediocre food as well, but that's for another day.) Yet weeks or months later, I find myself thinking about a dish, a meal, a place. It seems a waste to keep these to myself, the fantastic dishes and wonderful little finds. Here are four of those experiences that have stuck with me.

Victoria Parade, in Melbourne, is known for its pho houses, but another noodle lured me to this part of town. Oneyada Thai Cafe is an adorably colorful little shopfront, serving Thai breakfast and lunch. It opened in 2016 as an offshoot of the nearby and well-known Jinda Thai, owned by the Tanapat family. The breakfast dishes here are great, but it is their khao soi gai that haunts me. The northern Thai egg noodle curry soup is one of those dishes that can easily become an obsession, and it is hard to find in Australia at all, let alone a version this good.

Oneyada's is just about perfect: creamy coconut curry with a warming spice kick, chewy egg noodles, hunks of on-the-bone chicken pieces, fistfuls of chopped scallions and cilantro and red onion and fried shallots. The fresh crunch of all those different kinds of oniony bits and herbs cuts through the rich broth so beautifully it makes me a little emotional.

This restaurant reminded me of lots of places, none of them having much in common with its home in Gold Coast, Queensland. Lupo's location, in the crook of a strip mall behind a building on a highway, conjures Los Angeles. Its design has the feeling of a European cafe dropped into the middle of the tropics: lace curtains, burnished walls, copper bar, fans rotating warm ocean air. The soundtrack was awesome: Otis Redding leading into ""Sandinista!"" by the Clash. The menu looked like a lot of menus at a lot of new Australian restaurants these days -- everyone seems to have a kingfish ceviche and a steak (or lamb, or emu) tartare.

But Lupo excels at turning those tropes on their head, particularly the steak tartare. Here it is served as a steak sandwich, but the bread is in the form of thin, intensely crispy crostini, which is then doused in very good Spanish paprika. I'm not talking about a sprinkle here, I mean a literal pile of paprika. It sounds concerning, but it is an overkill that works -- and that I'm still thinking about months later.

A lovely restaurant in North Fremantle -- just south of Perth -- Propeller serves smart, modern Middle Eastern food . I had an exceedingly pleasant meal there, next to a brick wall dripping with ivy, but most of the food blended in my memory with many other modern Middle Eastern meals I've had in Australia and Los Angeles and elsewhere. All of it, that is, except one dish: a jumble of chicken livers cooked simply and perfectly in a piquant vinegar molasses combination and tossed with fat green and red grapes.

The grapes had obviously seen a hint of the hot pan, but not so much that they lost their structural, juicy integrity.

Media,Fox News Picks Bill Hemmer to Take Shepard Smith's Old Slot,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/09/business/media/fox-news-bill-hemmer-shepard-smith.html,"Fox News on Monday named Bill Hemmer, one of the network's longest-serving news anchors, to replace Shepard Smith as host of the channel's 3 p.m. weekday newscast.

Sports,Bill Belichick Never Tipped His Post-Brady Plan. Now It's Clear.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/sports/football/cam-newton-patriots-deal.html,"When Derek Jeter retired after the 2014 season, the Yankees did not have an obvious internal candidate to replace him, and that was not a problem. They believed, and so did their fans, that the team's next shortstop, no matter what, would be a good one, and he was: Didi Gregorius, acquired in a trade, blossomed into a dynamic all-around player during five seasons in pinstripes after an inauspicious start. Some professional sports franchises, because of their prestige and success, tend to engender a certain faith when making decisions, especially big ones. The Yankees are one of them. The New England Patriots are another. For the last three months, the Patriots' conspicuous quiet through the draft and free agency insinuated that Jarrett Stidham, a fourth-round pick in 2019, would replace the Hall of Fame-bound Tom Brady at quarterback. That seemed ludicrous and totally believable all at once.

With eight Super Bowl victories -- with six as New England's coach -- Bill Belichick has the organizational standing to say, and do, just about anything short of proclaiming his dog, a magnificent Alaskan Klee Kai named Nike, as special-teams coordinator. That includes not just moving on from perhaps the best quarterback in league history in Brady, who signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers earlier this off-season, but anointing as his successor a player who has attempted only four N.F.L. passes.

How the team adapted in that time, and thus the roster, was governed as much by what Brady did well as what he did not. If healthy, Newton allows the offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels to scheme a way to capitalize on the threat of his mobility or keep defenses honest with his arm, using the run-pass option. As other teams expended precious draft capital or lavished expensive contracts on quarterbacks, the Patriots waited. They stayed away from Marcus Mariota and Andy Dalton and Jameis Winston, all of whom signed short-term deals as backups, and opted not to draft a quarterback -- though, as Belichick indicated afterward, that was not necessarily by design. The Patriots have long cultivated a reputation as a team that skirts the boundaries of fair play, from their involvement in the so-called Spygate and Deflategate scandals to their most recent contretemps, in which they were fined $1.1 million and docked a 2021 third-round draft pick for videotaping the Cincinnati Bengals' sideline during a game last December in Cleveland. This move for Newton -- leaked, as it happened, minutes before the videotaping punishment was levied -- grants New England yet another edge. For Newton, the appeal of the Patriots is simple: the opportunity to resurrect his career with a banner franchise, for a legendary coach, with a forgiving depth chart. If he wanted to remain a starter, New England presented his best option. But while Newton upgrades the position, it is unclear how much he can help transform the rest of the roster. Beyond Brady, the Patriots also lost, among others, the star tight end Rob Gronkowski, who came out of retirement to play with his buddy in Tampa Bay; the defensive stalwarts Kyle Van Noy and Jamie Collins; kicker Stephen Gostkowski; and the offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia. The Patriots are not rebuilding but rather reinventing themselves, with a coach who loves to tinker. With Brady gone, the only person capable of cloaking the Patriots' deficiencies is Belichick, who is entrusted with squeezing a 12th consecutive division title from a team that will resemble none that he has overseen during his time in New England. After every coaching milestone, Belichick, who has won the third-most games in league history (273), deflects questions about his legacy and redirects praise onto his players. He has won with an array of stars, in different ways, but never without Brady, his tether for two decades. Given his choice, Belichick did not pick Bubba Crosby. He picked a former star, an electrifying and charismatic presence. He chose Cam Newton.","The Cam Newton signing shows why league observers have nearly unshakable faith in decisions made by the New England Patriots' coach.

(We have a fine pork version as well, called game-day nachos. You can start those tonight or tomorrow, cooking the pork in advance of a Sunday assembly.)

We'll maybe fry some spicy lacquered chicken wings. And bubble up some lamb and white bean chili. (Here's a fine vegetarian chili from Nigella Lawson, with a cornbread crust.) Maybe we'll make Melissa Clark's queso fundido, or the chef Quealy Watson's South Texas queso with a Southeast Asian twang. Clam dip? Chorizo-stuffed dates? Stuffed jalapenos? Yes. Loaded nachos, spicy chicken wings and queso fundido for the Super Bowl, with project cooking and brunch ideas for the weekend.",17,['17'],17
Education,Program Shapes the New Faces of Conservation,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/31/education/program-immerses-urban-students-in-nature.html,"SAPELO ISLAND, Ga. -- Joshua McCloud had never put his feet in the ocean. But here he was on a hot Southern afternoon, a shy 16-year-old from Atlanta with a love of science finally experiencing the wonders of the sea. Joshua was one of six urban teenagers visiting this remote barrier island for a few days and nights last week, boys who had barely any experience in the wilderness but on whose shoulders the future of environmental science might rest. The boys are among 100 students from 22 states chosen by the Nature Conservancy for an intensive summertime month of working outdoors. This is not the kind of program where a poor young adult from a city goes to a farm for a week to get a glimpse of something beyond a high-rise. Nor is it simply a way to address the condition known as nature-deficit disorder that is said to afflict children of the digital age. This is an effort to create scientists and engineers who do not look like most of those already in the field.

That both environmental science and the largest conservation organizations in the country are predominantly white is no secret. The number of minority students receiving undergraduate degrees in natural resources, agricultural management or related fields hovers around 10 percent of the total, according to the National Center for Education Statistics and Department of Agriculture reports. Prominent nonwhite professionals in the fields are rare, too; when President Obama selected Lisa Jackson as the first black leader of the Environmental Protection Agency, it was a significant moment. Groups like the National Black Environmental Justice Network, which have argued that environmental issues disproportionately affect minorities, have long pushed for more diversity in the profession. ""There's this misperception that African-Americans and minorities aren't connected to environmentalism because we're not seen in the big conservation groups or the profession over all,"" said Tyson-Lord Gray, who is working toward his doctorate in environmental ethics at Vanderbilt University and was one of two adult mentors who watched over the group in Georgia. Mr. Gray's grandfather was a farmer in Georgia, and like many people in the conservation field, he cites an early exposure to nature for his interest as an adult.

The idea behind the program, Leadership in Environmental Action for the Future -- a name chosen in large part so the acronym spells LEAF -- is to move promising minority students with a predisposition to nature into professions where conservation, the environment and natural resources are a theme. Most of the money to pay for it comes from the Toyota U.S.A. Foundation. The students are mostly from middle-class Hispanic, black or Asian families. All live in large cities and have high GPAs at high schools whose curriculums center on the environment. They are paid minimum wage to spend time in small groups on various projects around the country. In New Jersey, they banded osprey. The Georgia group pulled out invasive plant species, fixed trails, searched for endangered tortoises and counted oysters on an eroding shoreline. ""Basically, we're like mini-scientists,"" said Brandon Latorre, 16, who attends the High School for Environmental Studies in Manhattan and whose family is from the Dominican Republic. Terry Davis, 17, who attends Arabia Mountain High School near Atlanta, came by his interest in nature because his parents made him stay outside all day.

Opinion,Warren and Klobuchar Teach the Boys a Lesson,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/opinion/iowa-democratic-debate.html,"Would a female Democratic nominee have a harder time beating Donald Trump than a male one? I can't tell you, because I don't have a crystal ball and because it's a stupid question, its answer dependent on which female candidate you're talking about, on how she runs her campaign, on the twists and turns of the national conversation between now and November. But I can tell you this: Either of the two women among the six candidates on the stage in Des Moines on Tuesday night would give Trump a serious run for his money. Both have earned the right to take him on. Both would be formidable presidents. And both made clear, with commanding performances, how absurd it is that this country hasn't yet shattered the highest glass ceiling of all. I'm focusing on Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar because during the most electric stretch of this seventh debate of the Democratic primary, the focus was indeed on them -- or, rather, on the idea that their party couldn't risk nominating one of them at a juncture when getting rid of a Republican incumbent has seldom, if ever, been so important.

You know the back story. According to media reports over recent days, Warren and Bernie Sanders met 13 months ago to discuss their nascent presidential campaigns and he told her he didn't believe a woman could win the 2020 election. Sanders denies saying that. He denied it again on Tuesday night, and Warren declined to get into a back-and-forth about that conversation. What she did instead was more effective -- and certainly more stirring: She drew a contrast between the two women and the four men who had made the cut for this debate, which was the final one before the Iowa caucuses and had the fewest candidates so far. That contrast was perfect, and got better still when Klobuchar chimed in, because what the two women said brilliantly cast them not as trailblazers who had something extra to prove, not as outsiders who had finagled a way in, not as underdogs urging voters to take some extraordinary leap of faith, not as high-minded gambles. They turned the stubborn, sexist notion that their presence and presidential ambitions were exotic on its head, citing yardsticks by which they were demonstrably superior to their male rivals.

""I think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at people's winning record,"" Warren, a second-term senator from Massachusetts, said. ""Look at the men on this stage. Collectively, they have lost 10 elections."" She didn't name the men or the elections, but Joe Biden is the veteran of two previous, miserably unsuccessful campaigns for the presidency. Pete Buttigieg lost bids to become the treasurer of Indiana and the chairman of the Democratic National Committee.

In contrast, Warren noted, ""The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they've been in are the women -- Amy and me. And the only person who has beaten an incumbent Republican any time in the past 30 years is me."" Klobuchar, a third-term senator from Minnesota, said you don't need to be male to win just as you don't need other qualities pronounced necessary or optimal by some unnamed, amorphous committee of pronouncers. ""You don't have to be the skinniest person in the room,"" she said. ""You don't have to be the loudest person. You have to be competent."" ""And when you look at what I have done,"" she added, ""I have won every race, every place, every time. I have won in the reddest of districts. I have won in the suburban areas, in the rural areas."" That, she added, was why she had ""the most endorsements of current Iowa legislators and former Iowa legislators in this race."" I don't mean to romanticize Warren and Klobuchar. Warren's boast about vanquishing a Republican incumbent? That incumbent was Scott Brown, whose victory in a special election in deep blue Massachusetts was considered something of a freak occurrence to begin with. And when Klobuchar began to tick off the names of women recently elected to high posts, she suddenly froze, unable to remember who the governor of Kansas was, though she'd just said, ""I'm very proud to know her."" (Her name is Laura Kelly.) I'm also not saying that Warren or Klobuchar would be the party's best bet. I don't know who would be. I'm just saying that on a night when the viability of women aiming for the White House went from subtext to text, these two women found words -- not just in addressing that issue but also in talking about prescription-drug prices, climate change, nuclear weapons and more -- that exposed the bigotry and shamefulness of doubts about female candidates.

Otherwise the seventh debate was sleepily like many of the first six: Biden seemed to be campaigning for a third Barack Obama term, and his sentences were less straight lines than knots. They didn't build toward a conclusion so much as sag until they finally gave out. Warren said ""corruption"" every chance she got. Sanders called for revolution and correctly emphasized that many trade and foreign-policy positions that other Democrats came around to he embraced from the start.

Buttigieg pivoted from the question at hand to a practiced soliloquy that almost always had something to do with turning the page and a new generation. Tom Steyer insisted that no one cared about the environment as much as he did. And Klobuchar talked about so many different pieces of legislation with her name on them that you had this image of her racing around the Capitol with an outstretched pen, stopping all aides who passed by and scrawling her signature on any paper they were carrying. One new wrinkle was Warren's clear and proud positioning of herself to Sanders's right on trade and on health care. She was making the case for herself as a progressive who would favor incremental fixes if those were the only available improvements and who could be a unifier; she suggested that Sanders lacked that potential. Buttigieg, meanwhile, was more determined than ever to mention and reach out to voters of color, from whom he enjoys little support. But what most distinguished the debate was the way in which gender came to the fore. There was a memorable moment when Sanders sought to correct Warren on her 30-year claim, noting that he'd defeated a Republican in 1990, and she did some quick, out-loud arithmetic to determine that 1990 was, well, 30 years ago! Mansplaining met mathematics. Warren also said this: ""Since Donald Trump was elected, women candidates have outperformed men candidates in competitive races. And in 2018, we took back the House; we took back statehouses, because of women candidates and women voters."" ""Back in the 1960s,"" she added, ""people asked, 'Could a Catholic win?' Back in 2008, people asked if an African-American could win. In both times the Democratic Party stepped up and said yes, got behind their candidate and we changed America. That's who we are."" It was a self-serving edit of history, sure, and it put the most positive gloss possible on the nation's character. But that didn't make it any less important. Or any less inspiring.

And in 2018, we took back the House; we took back statehouses, because of women candidates and women voters."" ""Back in the 1960s,"" she added, ""people asked, 'Could a Catholic win?' Back in 2008, people asked if an African-American could win. In both times the Democratic Party stepped up and said yes, got behind their candidate and we changed America. That's who we are."" It was a self-serving edit of history, sure, and it put the most positive gloss possible on the nation's character. But that didn't make it any less important. Or any less inspiring.

Theater,Review: A Father Consumed by Grief in 'My Eyes Went Dark',https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/26/theater/my-eyes-went-dark-review.html,"On July 2, 2002, a passenger jet collided in midair with a cargo plane over Germany, killing 71 people. It was a mistake caused by technical issues and a slow response from the sole air traffic controller.

Balancing loss and revenge -- it's a story worthy of the most memorable of characters, from Medea to Inigo Montoya.

Automobiles,Ford Wants to Take Next Mustang to New Places,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/06/automobiles/ford-wants-to-take-next-mustang-to-new-places.html,"Online media leaks aside, the 2015 Ford Mustang is, officially, no longer a secret after its unveiling Thursday morning in New York City and five other sites around the world. Alan R. Mulally, Ford's chief executive, spoke at the New York opening, noting that it was here, at the 1964 World's Fair, that the Mustang was first introduced to an enthusiastic public. ""It's so fun to be back here 50 years later to introduce the completely new, sleek-styled Ford Mustang,"" he said at the news conference, next to a 2015 Mustang convertible. A turbocharged fastback model sat outside.

""Not only is this a world-class sports car that's been in production for 50 years, it's going to be available to everyone around the world,"" Mr. Mulally said in an interview before the unveiling. Lower and wider than the current, retro-styled generation, which made its debut for the 2005 model year, Ford's new car still has the long snout, blunt nose and short rear deck that has come to define the pony car genre over five decades. Ford's engineers were able to squeeze more interior space into the car -- adding hip and shoulder room to the new model, as well as a trunk large enough to accommodate two golf bags.

Aside from sheet-metal changes, the new model has been the recipient of striking suspension and power plant revisions. For the first time, the Mustang will have a modern independent rear suspension instead of the old-fashioned live axle that has been a mainstay of past models. Ford said the improved rear suspension led to refinement of the front suspension, too. It now features a double-ball-joint MacPherson strut design that the automaker says improves stability over previous models and allows for the installation of larger front brakes. Along with engine choices that include a 300-horsepower 3.7-liter V6 and a 420-horsepower 5-liter V8, Ford has added a 305-horsepower 2.3-liter EcoBoost 4-cylinder, a turbocharged engine that it says will be more appealing in overseas markets where gasoline costs more than in the United States.

MyFord Touch, the heart of Ford's in-car infotainment system, had come under fire in recent years over its reliability and ease of use, notably by J.D. Power and Consumer Reports. But Mr. Mulally said Ford had simplified the system, adding knobs where customers said they preferred a tactile interface. There's no word on whether the new Mustang will get all-wheel drive and other upgrades, but Mr. Mulally suggested that such features remained possible. ""Everyone who knows the Mustang knows that there will be a lot of fabulous derivatives,"" he said. He said that the car's distinctiveness, powertrain options and utility would make it an attractive option for consumers around the world. One of its major features, he added, will be affordability. ""On Jan. 24, 1925, Henry Ford laid out his plan, in an ad, to open the highways to all mankind,"" Mr. Mulally said. ""We are accelerating Henry Ford's vision, and the next proof point of that is the new Mustang.

Travel,"A $1,000 Day in Tokyo for $100",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/08/travel/tokyo-budget-travel.html,"I walked out of Tokyo Station, the big commuter hub in the city's Chiyoda district, and turned to look up at its gorgeous brick facade. I was lost. I couldn't find the Tokyo Station Hotel -- a well-reviewed luxury property that was renovated in 2012. My mistake, it turned out, was leaving the train station at all. The hotel and the train station coexist in one long, outstretched building, which was completed in 1914 and offers a refreshing prewar architectural counterpoint to the glittering glass-and-steel skyscrapers Tokyo is now known for. I looped back in and found the hotel's lobby, as well as its chief concierge, Marie Antoinette Mori, who greeted me at her desk. Originally from the Philippines, Ms. Mori became fascinated with Japan during its big 1980s economic boom. She studied international tourism in Japan, married a Japanese man and began working in the hospitality industry, where her career took off. ""I became one of the favorites of Mr. Stringer"" -- the former Sony chairman Howard Stringer. ""I was the only one who wasn't afraid of him,"" she said with a laugh. Ms. Mori had prepared an itinerary for a fictitious guest, spending $1,000 (about 110,000 yen) over the course of a day in this often-pricey city. My goal was to remake the itinerary on a budget of $100 -- necessarily cutting a few corners, but hoping to retain the spirit of the original. HIGH Ms. Mori escorted me to the top floor of her hotel, into a huge room where sunlight flooded in through large skylights. Guests grazed on a large, comprehensive morning buffet. Ms. Mori recommended the Tokyo Station Hotel breakfast (3,800 yen), where they could enjoy standard Western fare (eggs made to order, coffee, pastries) or regional Japanese staples, where the Tokyo Station really excels: Ishikari-nabe (hot pot from the northern Hokkaido region), traditional rice porridge, soybean milk skin, and boiled rape blossoms. Ms. Mori said many luxury hotels in the area had comparable buffets. The Shangri-La, she said, specializes in pastries. ""Over there they have a, uh ... what do you call it?"" she asked. ""A Cronut.""

HIGH Ms. Mori quoted a price of roughly 15,000 yen to have a private sedan with a driver for three hours to ferry our faux big-spender around the city. The Tokyo Station Hotel goes so far as to meet guests at train platforms and escort them to the hotel -- a service that comes only with staying at the hotel, of course, which can run over $1,000 per night. LOW Logistics are tricky for those unfamiliar with the city. Get to know and love the train, because you'll be spending quite a bit of time with it. Tokyo's system is expansive and can be, in a word, daunting. There are over 100 different railway lines in Tokyo, and most of them are privately held by competing companies. The two big ones you'll need to know are JR East, the largest railway system in Japan, and the Tokyo Metro, the city's busiest subway system. If you're planning to use only the subway or JR lines, there are passes for that. A combination ticket, though (which can be purchased in JR stations), is the better way to go. For 1,590 yen, you'll be able to use several lines for one day, including all of Tokyo's JR lines and the Tokyo Metro. Another option is to buy a Suica or Pasmo card (available at ticket vending machines in major train stations), reusable cards on which you load money; you touch them to the turnstile each time you ride.

There is a 500-yen deposit to pick up one of those cards, but it's worth it -- you won't have to deal with individual tickets, you'll get a small discount on rides and you can even use it to make purchases in some stores and at the city's ubiquitous vending machines. Related pro tip Get a SIM card for your phone -- data only. You won't want to be without a maps app when you're walking around. Cards in the $15 to $20 range are widely available. (Make sure you get the right size: the latest-generation iPhones, for example, use nano SIM cards, not micro SIM.) On Greenery Day, admission is free at many Tokyo parks and gardens, including the Koishikawa Botanical Gardens in the Bunkyo neighborhood. Noah Fecks for The New York Times HIGH The Asakusa neighborhood is known for its Sensoji Buddhist temple, Tokyo's oldest. Ms. Mori recommended a rickshaw tour of the neighborhood, passing along Sumida Park, one of the many places in Tokyo to see sakura, or cherry blossoms, in the early spring. A two-hour tour costs 16,250 yen. LOW I set out to do some exploring on my own, and see some sakura in the process. A follower of the Frugal Traveler Twitter account recommended the Nezu Museum in the Minato district. While the Nezu's collection of Buddhist art and Chinese bronzes was interesting, I was most impressed with the lush garden out back. The garden -- about four acres -- is shockingly big in a place where space is so precious. It truly feels like an escape from the city. Admission was 1,000 yen. From there, I hopped a couple of trains over to the Korakuen station and walked up to the University of Tokyo's Koishikawa Botanical Gardens. After paying admission (400 yen) I headed from the southeast entrance to a huge open expanse in the center of the garden. I found families picnicking, children playing and people lining up for coffee and tea from the ramshackle snack bar called Coffee Time (a coffee is 300 yen). All were enjoying the budding cherry blossoms and cool spring weather.

LOW Jiro received three Michelin stars; Tsuta received one. It was the first Japanese ramen shop ever to receive such an honor. The small, unassuming space, close to the Sugamo station on the JR Yamanote line, is difficult to get into for different reasons: They take no reservations and operate on a ticket system. I went early one morning, around 7:30 a.m., and waited outside the restaurant with a handful of other people. Eventually the door slid open and a man came out with a handful of small, laminated tickets. He handed me one: ""Come back,"" he said. ""Between 12 and 1 p.m."" He took a 1,000-yen bill as a deposit, then went back inside and closed the door. When I returned at noon, I was treated to the best bowl of shoyu (soy sauce-based) ramen I'd ever eaten. The broth was deep, intense and slightly sweet. The accompaniments -- soft-boiled egg, bamboo shoots and pork slices -- were done perfectly. The basic ramen bowl at Tsuta is 950 yen -- I paid a total of 1,250 for three extra slices of pork. HIGH Who doesn't like a little costume play built into their vacations? Ms. Mori recommended something called a ""kimono experience and photo shoot,"" wherein the patron pays for elaborate kimono dress (in one of several styles: oiran, maiko or geisha), as well as hair and makeup. A photo shoot follows. Men, don't think you're getting out of this: There's a samurai option for you. The oiran set with two kimonos costs 27,000 yen. LOW I found a different way to incorporate both ceremonial clothing (of sorts) and culture into my visit: taking in a Japanese baseball game. I bought my ticket at one of the many 7-Elevens in Japan. (7-Eleven is owned by a Japanese company.) It was a complicated process, one that involved a helpful clerk trying to spell my name in the Japanese alphabet -- buying at the stadium probably would have been easier. It also involved deciding what ""cheering section"" I wanted to sit in. I decided on an outfield ticket on the side of the home team, the Tokyo Yakult Swallows. The game was positively raucous -- at one point, everyone in my section produced tiny umbrellas and began thrusting them up and down and chanting (a pro-Swallows chant, I assumed) while a small brass band backed them up. The stadium grub selection was great, too -- a big bowl of ramen could be had for 750 yen, yakitori for 100 yen, and a whiskey and melon soda for 600 yen. My ticket cost a reasonable 1,800 yen. Dinner is prepared at Midori Sushi restaurant in a far-flung neighborhood. Noah Fecks for The New York Times HIGH Seiji Yamamoto is the chef at Nihonryori RyuGin, a modern kaiseki restaurant that was awarded three Michelin stars. Mr. Yamamoto is known for incorporating modern culinary techniques with the refined, traditional kaiseki dinner. The descriptions of RyuGin's courses are wonderfully abstract: Dishes have names like ""Coolness Warmth Playfulness Nostalgia and Temptation"" and ""A Message From the Coast of Japan."" Dinner costs 27,000 yen. LOW I was also in search of a taste of the coast of Japan, in the form of a sushi dinner. I met up with my friend Mayumi, a Tokyo native, and presented her with my annoyingly specific parameters: something good but not that good; cheap but definitely not poor quality. She good-humoredly took me to a small place near the Kyodo train station in her neighborhood, about a 20-minute ride from Shinjuku: Midori Sushi, an unpretentious restaurant next to a KFC. The chef Ken Hosono's 10-course omakase menu featured an exceptionally silky-smooth squid, along with barracuda, fatty tuna, uni and a wonderfully buttery scallop, among other pieces. The cost was 3,000 yen per person. Not only was it one of best sushi dinners I've had in recent memory, but it was among the cheapest -- a difficult-to-hit sweet spot that every frugal traveler seeks out.",Sushi? Check.

From there, I hopped a couple of trains over to the Korakuen station and walked up to the University of Tokyo's Koishikawa Botanical Gardens. After paying admission (400 yen) I headed from the southeast entrance to a huge open expanse in the center of the garden. I found families picnicking, children playing and people lining up for coffee and tea from the ramshackle snack bar called Coffee Time (a coffee is 300 yen). All were enjoying the budding cherry blossoms and cool spring weather.

LOW Jiro received three Michelin stars; Tsuta received one. It was the first Japanese ramen shop ever to receive such an honor. The small, unassuming space, close to the Sugamo station on the JR Yamanote line, is difficult to get into for different reasons: They take no reservations and operate on a ticket system. I went early one morning, around 7:30 a.m., and waited outside the restaurant with a handful of other people. Eventually the door slid open and a man came out with a handful of small, laminated tickets. He handed me one: ""Come back,"" he said. ""Between 12 and 1 p.m."" He took a 1,000-yen bill as a deposit, then went back inside and closed the door. When I returned at noon, I was treated to the best bowl of shoyu (soy sauce-based) ramen I'd ever eaten. The broth was deep, intense and slightly sweet. The accompaniments -- soft-boiled egg, bamboo shoots and pork slices -- were done perfectly. The basic ramen bowl at Tsuta is 950 yen -- I paid a total of 1,250 for three extra slices of pork. HIGH Who doesn't like a little costume play built into their vacations? Ms. Mori recommended something called a ""kimono experience and photo shoot,"" wherein the patron pays for elaborate kimono dress (in one of several styles: oiran, maiko or geisha), as well as hair and makeup. A photo shoot follows. Men, don't think you're getting out of this: There's a samurai option for you. The oiran set with two kimonos costs 27,000 yen. LOW I found a different way to incorporate both ceremonial clothing (of sorts) and culture into my visit: taking in a Japanese baseball game. I bought my ticket at one of the many 7-Elevens in Japan. (7-Eleven is owned by a Japanese company.) It was a complicated process, one that involved a helpful clerk trying to spell my name in the Japanese alphabet -- buying at the stadium probably would have been easier. It also involved deciding what ""cheering section"" I wanted to sit in. I decided on an outfield ticket on the side of the home team, the Tokyo Yakult Swallows. The game was positively raucous -- at one point, everyone in my section produced tiny umbrellas and began thrusting them up and down and chanting (a pro-Swallows chant, I assumed) while a small brass band backed them up. The stadium grub selection was great, too -- a big bowl of ramen could be had for 750 yen, yakitori for 100 yen, and a whiskey and melon soda for 600 yen. My ticket cost a reasonable 1,800 yen. Dinner is prepared at Midori Sushi restaurant in a far-flung neighborhood. Noah Fecks for The New York Times HIGH Seiji Yamamoto is the chef at Nihonryori RyuGin, a modern kaiseki restaurant that was awarded three Michelin stars. Mr. Yamamoto is known for incorporating modern culinary techniques with the refined, traditional kaiseki dinner. The descriptions of RyuGin's courses are wonderfully abstract: Dishes have names like ""Coolness Warmth Playfulness Nostalgia and Temptation"" and ""A Message From the Coast of Japan."" Dinner costs 27,000 yen. LOW I was also in search of a taste of the coast of Japan, in the form of a sushi dinner. I met up with my friend Mayumi, a Tokyo native, and presented her with my annoyingly specific parameters: something good but not that good; cheap but definitely not poor quality. She good-humoredly took me to a small place near the Kyodo train station in her neighborhood, about a 20-minute ride from Shinjuku: Midori Sushi, an unpretentious restaurant next to a KFC. The chef Ken Hosono's 10-course omakase menu featured an exceptionally silky-smooth squid, along with barracuda, fatty tuna, uni and a wonderfully buttery scallop, among other pieces. The cost was 3,000 yen per person. Not only was it one of best sushi dinners I've had in recent memory, but it was among the cheapest -- a difficult-to-hit sweet spot that every frugal traveler seeks out. Sushi? Check. Cherry blossoms? Check. But also a sprawling subway system and a baseball game.",,"A $1,000 Day in Tokyo for $100 I walked out of Tokyo Station, the big commuter hub in the city's Chiyoda district, and turned to look up at its gorgeous brick facade. I was lost. I couldn't find the Tokyo Station Hotel -- a well-reviewed luxury property that was renovated in 2012. My mistake, it turned out, was leaving the train station at all. The hotel and the train station coexist in one long, outstretched building, which was completed in 1914 and offers a refreshing prewar architectural counterpoint to the glittering glass-and-steel skyscrapers Tokyo is now known for. I looped back in and found the hotel's lobby, as well as its chief concierge, Marie Antoinette Mori, who greeted me at her desk. Originally from the Philippines, Ms. Mori became fascinated with Japan during its big 1980s economic boom. She studied international tourism in Japan, married a Japanese man and began working in the hospitality industry, where her career took off. ""I became one of the favorites of Mr. Stringer"" -- the former Sony chairman Howard Stringer. ""I was the only one who wasn't afraid of him,"" she said with a laugh. Ms. Mori had prepared an itinerary for a fictitious guest, spending $1,000 (about 110,000 yen) over the course of a day in this often-pricey city. My goal was to remake the itinerary on a budget of $100 -- necessarily cutting a few corners, but hoping to retain the spirit of the original. HIGH Ms. Mori escorted me to the top floor of her hotel, into a huge room where sunlight flooded in through large skylights. Guests grazed on a large, comprehensive morning buffet. Ms. Mori recommended the Tokyo Station Hotel breakfast (3,800 yen), where they could enjoy standard Western fare (eggs made to order, coffee, pastries) or regional Japanese staples, where the Tokyo Station really excels: Ishikari-nabe (hot pot from the northern Hokkaido region), traditional rice porridge, soybean milk skin, and boiled rape blossoms. Ms. Mori said many luxury hotels in the area had comparable buffets. The Shangri-La, she said, specializes in pastries. ""Over there they have a, uh ... what do you call it?"" she asked. ""A Cronut.""

HIGH Ms. Mori quoted a price of roughly 15,000 yen to have a private sedan with a driver for three hours to ferry our faux big-spender around the city. The Tokyo Station Hotel goes so far as to meet guests at train platforms and escort them to the hotel -- a service that comes only with staying at the hotel, of course, which can run over $1,000 per night. LOW Logistics are tricky for those unfamiliar with the city. Get to know and love the train, because you'll be spending quite a bit of time with it. Tokyo's system is expansive and can be, in a word, daunting. There are over 100 different railway lines in Tokyo, and most of them are privately held by competing companies. The two big ones you'll need to know are JR East, the largest railway system in Japan, and the Tokyo Metro, the city's busiest subway system. If you're planning to use only the subway or JR lines, there are passes for that. A combination ticket, though (which can be purchased in JR stations), is the better way to go. For 1,590 yen, you'll be able to use several lines for one day, including all of Tokyo's JR lines and the Tokyo Metro. Another option is to buy a Suica or Pasmo card (available at ticket vending machines in major train stations), reusable cards on which you load money; you touch them to the turnstile each time you ride.

There is a 500-yen deposit to pick up one of those cards, but it's worth it -- you won't have to deal with individual tickets, you'll get a small discount on rides and you can even use it to make purchases in some stores and at the city's ubiquitous vending machines. Related pro tip Get a SIM card for your phone -- data only. You won't want to be without a maps app when you're walking around. Cards in the $15 to $20 range are widely available. (Make sure you get the right size: the latest-generation iPhones, for example, use nano SIM cards, not micro SIM.) On Greenery Day, admission is free at many Tokyo parks and gardens, including the Koishikawa Botanical Gardens in the Bunkyo neighborhood. Noah Fecks for The New York Times HIGH The Asakusa neighborhood is known for its Sensoji Buddhist temple, Tokyo's oldest. Ms. Mori recommended a rickshaw tour of the neighborhood, passing along Sumida Park, one of the many places in Tokyo to see sakura, or cherry blossoms, in the early spring. A two-hour tour costs 16,250 yen. LOW I set out to do some exploring on my own, and see some sakura in the process. A follower of the Frugal Traveler Twitter account recommended the Nezu Museum in the Minato district. While the Nezu's collection of Buddhist art and Chinese bronzes was interesting, I was most impressed with the lush garden out back. The garden -- about four acres -- is shockingly big in a place where space is so precious. It truly feels like an escape from the city. Admission was 1,000 yen.

Real Estate,An Investor Adjusts His Ambitions,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/realestate/commercial/scott-lawlor-adjusts-his-real-estate-investment-ambitions.html,"For many observers of the arcane world of commercial real estate investment, Scott Lawlor became a tarnished emblem for the aggressive investors who poured other people's money into major office buildings at the height of the market, driving values into the stratosphere until the bubble burst. Mr. Lawlor -- who famously acquired the John Hancock Tower in Boston in 2006 and whose lenders then sold it at a substantial loss three years later -- had his funds lose more than two-thirds of their value during the recession. Now with the real estate boom far behind him, he has quietly returned to commercial real estate investing, but instead of going after trophy buildings in big cities, he is buying up garden apartment complexes in much smaller towns. More than $3.5 billion in property deals that involved Mr. Lawlor's private equity fund, Broadway Real Estate Partners, had financing trouble during the downturn, but all those deals have since been restructured or otherwise resolved, with billions lost in the process. While Mr. Lawlor is not proud of that record, he isn't hiding from it either. But he appears to have given his investment approach an extreme makeover. Instead of prominent buildings in places like New York and Boston, he is buying residential complexes in secondary and tertiary markets like Greenville, S.C. and Maryville, Tenn.

Instead of raising a huge fund from institutions with the discretion to invest as he chooses, he now raises capital deal by individual deal from an array of deep-pocketed private investors. He has also given up on borrowing heavily and using short-term floating-rate debt to pay for at least 80 percent of a building's cost -- a strategy that got Broadway and an army of other real estate investors into trouble a few years ago. Mr. Lawlor says he now obtains long-term, fixed-rate financing for just 60 percent of an asset's total cost, including renovations. Looking back at his former approach, he said, ""I'm never going to be in that situation again. What we are doing now is very different."" His new strategy, he said, is long-term and conservative. ""It's not sexy, and there's no loss of sleep and very little risk."" His basic strategy: finding relatively small deals -- around $20 million -- in markets that larger investors are passing up, and instead of seeking spectacular returns for his backers, he aims to get them steady, reliable income over a seven- to 10-year period. Mr. Lawlor has certainly chosen his markets well. According to the Real Capital Analytics Commercial Property Price Index, apartment prices in the Southeast have been rising more slowly than in the country as a whole, and are still nearly 25 percent below average prices at the market peak; that's well off the national average for apartments of just 8 percent below peak levels.

Ronald Johnsey, the president of apartment research firm Axiometrics, said that the strategy that Mr. Lawlor's new investment vehicle, Waypoint Residential Management, has adopted was a good one. ""They are going into submarkets that appear to have been overlooked in terms of new supply,"" he said. Owners have deferred improvements to their second-tier properties in places like Greenville, S.C., as they struggled -- and often failed -- to hold on to ownership. So rents have not budged, while they have risen for top-quality buildings, said Tony Bonitati, director of the multifamily division of NAI Earle Furman in Greenville, a commercial real estate services firm. In the last quarter of 2012, according to Axiometrics, average class B rents in Greenville averaged 65 percent behind class A rents, up from a historical spread of 48 percent. A similar spread is evident in other Waypoint markets like Orlando.

These investments may look simple on the surface, but Mr. Lawlor still has an appetite for what he calls ""hairy"" situations -- deals that require some effort beyond a simple buy-and-hold strategy if the full value of the investment is to be realized. ""From time to time,"" he said, Waypoint will invest in ""special situations that are bigger and more complicated."" In the deal that represents Waypoint's largest buyout effort to date, the company acquired a 49 percent stake in a pool of four distressed apartment properties, with more than 1,100 units, across the Southeast. Although the noncontrolling stake means Waypoint still has a lot of work to do to gain ownership of what Mr. Lawlor calls ""an extraordinary investment opportunity,"" he said the deal ""gets us in the door."" Also last year, Waypoint, which is based in Greenwich, Conn., bought 198 units in a failed condo project in Orlando for $25.1 million -- half the price paid by the previous investor who undertook a condo conversion, but was foreclosed on before completion.

That buyer sold 10 percent of the units as condos before losing the property, so Waypoint now owns 90 percent of the remaining units. These are fully rented and producing income, according to a market source familiar with the deal who was not authorized to speak about it, but real success will come for Waypoint if it can gain control of the condo association and eventually unite the property under one owner. In complicated transactions like these, where his investors will receive income while Waypoint pursues greater control, Mr. Lawlor believes the returns outweigh the uncertainty of when, or whether, he can unlock the properties' full value. Since 2011, Waypoint has acquired at least 2,412 apartments in 10 properties and has developed or is building 518 units in two projects. Mr. Lawlor placed the value of these assets at around $300 million, although Waypoint has invested far less than that by engaging in various partnerships, buying distressed properties and avoiding competitive auctions. To strengthen its operations, Waypoint last year acquired a multifamily property management company in Florida. The company already had some 7,000 units under management before adding Waypoint's acquisitions. Another point of departure for Mr. Lawlor is where he is finding his capital. Instead of institutions like pension funds and insurance companies, his investors are wealthy people looking for long-term income at rates higher than Treasury yields. ""There's an opportunity to fill a void in the real estate capital markets,"" he said, pointing not to investors who want to invest $1 million or $2 million, but those who might want to put $20 million or $30 million into real estate. ""That market is underserved,"" he said. Albert Zdenek, president and chief executive of Traust Sollus Wealth Management in Manhattan, said his clients appreciated both the yield and the transparency offered by vehicles like Waypoint, although he disputes that his clients are ""underserved"" in real estate choices. Still, his clients, he said, appreciate ""having an asset class with steady returns,"" especially if they can ""buy in at the bottom."" In addition, he said the opportunity to examine individual property deals beforehand is attractive. Last but not least, attractive financing from the government-sponsored agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also helps Mr. Lawlor's efforts.","Instead of going after trophy buildings in big cities, Scott Lawlor is buying up garden apartment complexes in much smaller towns, earning steady income.",314f4ec6-1408-537f-8139-50ebd02edbd4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/03/27/business/LAWLOR/LAWLOR-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=896&w=600&s=f0035d96ecd0fbe55fc7ab7b37a8716bfaab56243f4a45eec65cbcc3e7e1dcbf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Scott Lawlor at his office in Greenwich, Conn.

These are fully rented and producing income, according to a market source familiar with the deal who was not authorized to speak about it, but real success will come for Waypoint if it can gain control of the condo association and eventually unite the property under one owner. In complicated transactions like these, where his investors will receive income while Waypoint pursues greater control, Mr. Lawlor believes the returns outweigh the uncertainty of when, or whether, he can unlock the properties' full value. Since 2011, Waypoint has acquired at least 2,412 apartments in 10 properties and has developed or is building 518 units in two projects. Mr. Lawlor placed the value of these assets at around $300 million, although Waypoint has invested far less than that by engaging in various partnerships, buying distressed properties and avoiding competitive auctions. To strengthen its operations, Waypoint last year acquired a multifamily property management company in Florida. The company already had some 7,000 units under management before adding Waypoint's acquisitions. Another point of departure for Mr. Lawlor is where he is finding his capital. Instead of institutions like pension funds and insurance companies, his investors are wealthy people looking for long-term income at rates higher than Treasury yields. ""There's an opportunity to fill a void in the real estate capital markets,"" he said, pointing not to investors who want to invest $1 million or $2 million, but those who might want to put $20 million or $30 million into real estate. ""That market is underserved,"" he said. Albert Zdenek, president and chief executive of Traust Sollus Wealth Management in Manhattan, said his clients appreciated both the yield and the transparency offered by vehicles like Waypoint, although he disputes that his clients are ""underserved"" in real estate choices. Still, his clients, he said, appreciate ""having an asset class with steady returns,"" especially if they can ""buy in at the bottom."" In addition, he said the opportunity to examine individual property deals beforehand is attractive. Last but not least, attractive financing from the government-sponsored agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac also helps Mr. Lawlor's efforts. Instead of going after trophy buildings in big cities, Scott Lawlor is buying up garden apartment complexes in much smaller towns, earning steady income.",7,['7'],7
Economy,Rates Are Going Up. What Could Go Wrong?,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/business/economy/effects-of-past-interest-rate-increases-offer-guide-to-future-risks.html,"Rates Are Going Up. What Could Go Wrong?

When expansions end and the economy tips into recession, one or the other is usually to blame. In the past, the culprit has frequently been fire -- an overheating economy and rising inflation -- that prompted the central bank to push up interest rates until they ultimately choked off growth. Ice is more unusual, at least in the United States, but often more painful, as excess capacity, weak demand and falling prices foster a deflationary slump that can prove difficult to escape. As the Federal Reserve embarks on a new chapter in monetary policy, having raised rates on Dec. 16 for the first time in nearly a decade, policy makers are acutely aware of the risks posed by either possibility. ""Raising rates the first time may have been the easy part; now comes the challenging part,"" said Mike Ryan, chief investment strategist for UBS Wealth Management Americas.

But being too slow to tighten the reins of monetary policy can prove perilous, too. A series of steady quarter-point rate increases by the Fed between 2004 and 2006 seemed prudent at the time, but in hindsight the central bank has been blamed for moving too slowly, failing to head off the economic catastrophe that followed the implosion of the housing bubble in 2007. The biggest problem is that higher interest rates do not bite in predictable ways. Not only do they take time to percolate through the real economy, but there is also a difficult-to-foresee threshold at which the impact can suddenly shift from mild to severe. ""I'm sure there is a tipping point,"" Mr. Ryan said. ""It's just hard to know in advance precisely where that is.""

At least for now, though, few analysts expect the Fed's initial moves to bring the nation's six-and-a-half-year-old expansion to an abrupt end. ""The rate hike this month and those next year may not really be felt until 2017,"" said Michael Hanson, senior United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""Evidence from past cycles suggests it could take a year, rather than the next quarter or two.""

The Fed's task this time is even more complicated because other central banks are leaning in the opposite direction. With growth in Europe still sputtering, the European Central Bank has belatedly turned to the tools embraced by the Fed several years ago, buying up securities and pumping money into the financial system. But even with some interest rates there in negative territory, Mario Draghi, president of the E.C.B., is under pressure to loosen monetary policy further. In Asia, the People's Bank of China is also in easing mode, as officials try to cushion what looks like an increasingly hard landing for the economy there, the world's second-largest. Similarly, Japan's central bank is keeping interest rates at rock-bottom levels to encourage growth. The combination of lower rates abroad and rising ones at home is making the United States dollar surge against other currencies. While that might be good for American tourists heading overseas, it hurts American manufacturers seeking export markets and makes imported goods more competitive, undermining the country's trade balance.

""The risk is skewed toward moving too fast,"" said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. ""That's especially true as the strong dollar and lower-priced imports keep inflationary pressures at bay in the United States."" Although Mr. Gapen, like most seers on Wall Street, is generally upbeat about the economy's prospects next year, some of his colleagues elsewhere are less sanguine. David Levy, a longtime private economist, is warning clients that the Fed may be forced to reverse course as weakness in China and emerging markets redounds to the United States. The Fed's rate increase on Wednesday, Mr. Levy cautioned, ""may well mark a high point in economic expectations for 2016."" In its statement Wednesday about the decision to raise rates, the Fed itself noted there had been a ""shortfall"" in terms of actual inflation's not measuring up to the central bank's 2 percent goal, which it considers helpful in supporting a more robust economy.

For his part, Mr. Anderson expects the economy to continue to grow at a moderate annual pace of about 2.4 percent in 2016. If that forecast for growth is correct, he predicts the Fed will raise rates three times next year, lifting the benchmark rate to a range of 1 to 1.25 percent by the end of 2016. ""Consumers are cautious but they still have the capacity to spend,"" Mr. Anderson added. ""Jobs and incomes are growing, debt levels are low and gas at about $2 a gallon should help. When people realize the sky isn't falling because the Fed is raising rates, they will go back to their usual spending habits and save the day."" A growth rate of about 2 percent would be in line with the steady, but disappointing, advance that has characterized the current recovery since it began in mid-2009. By contrast, the economy grew by 3.8 percent in 2004 when the last tightening cycle began, and by 4 percent in 1994 when an earlier round of rate hikes got underway. The comparatively weak recovery, which has left most Americans struggling to maintain their standard of living, is the principal reason the Fed has promised to move more slowly during this tightening cycle than in past ones. In the mid-2000s, the Fed raised rates by 0.25 percentage point at every meeting between June 2004 and June 2006, 17 straight increases that lifted rates by more than four full percentage points over two years. The tightening campaign in the 1990s was even steeper, as rates moved up three points in one year. Although that wreaked havoc on the stock and bond markets in 1994, the move may have helped slow growth to a sustainable pace and set the stage for the 1990s expansion to extend for a full decade.","Having raised rates this month for the first time in nearly a decade, the Federal Reserve does not have to look far for real-world examples of what to do if plans go awry.",aeff48ed-e379-523c-81e0-08bf00219462,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/20/business/21past-web/21past-web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=214b9e71ff076d1341941b1987a89129ac01a921480e0b17e921f0d7412c89bc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Traders at the Chicago Board Options Exchange on Dec. 16, the day the Fed announced a rate increase of 0.25 percent.",aeff48ed-e379-523c-81e0-08bf00219462,Demo_data/D1_img2/1aeff48ed-e379-523c-81e0-08bf00219462.jpg,8,"Rates Are Going Up.

Health,Addiction Treatment Grew Under Health Law. Now What?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/health/addiction-treatment-opiods-aca-obamacare.html,"MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Chad Diaz began using heroin when he was 12. Now 36 and newly covered by Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, he is on Suboxone, a substitute opioid that eases withdrawal symptoms and cravings, and he is slowly pulling himself together. ""This is the best my life has gone in many, many years,"" Mr. Diaz, a big man wearing camouflage, said as he sat in a community health center here. If Congress and President Trump succeed in dismantling the Affordable Care Act, he will have no insurance to pay for his medication or counseling, and he fears he will slide back to heroin. ""If this gets taken from me, it's right back to Square 1,"" he said. ""And that's not a good place. I'm scary when I'm using. I don't care who I hurt.""

As the debate over the fate of the health law intensifies, proponents have focused on the lifesaving care it has brought to people with cancer, diabetes and other physical illnesses. But the law has also had a profound, though perhaps less heralded, effect on mental health and addiction treatment, vastly expanding access to those services by designating them as ""essential benefits"" that must be covered through the A.C.A. marketplaces and expanded Medicaid. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group, calculates that 2.8 million people with substance use disorders, including 220,000 with opioid disorders, have coverage under the A.C.A. As the opioid epidemic continues to devastate communities nationwide, public health officials say the law has begun to make a critical difference in their ability to treat and rehabilitate people.

""Of all the illnesses, this is one where we've seen very dramatic changes and where we stand to lose the most ground if we lose the A.C.A.,"" said Linda Rosenberg, president and chief executive of the National Council for Behavioral Health, adding that treatment programs have begun to be integrated into primary care clinics and health care systems nationwide. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to rid the country of Obamacare but also to address the opioid epidemic and expand access to drug treatment. Many of the states hardest hit by opioids -- including Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky -- voted for Mr. Trump, but some Republican governors have expressed concern about what might happen to people being treated for addiction if their party repeals or scales back the health law.

John Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio, where the Medicaid expansion has covered 700,000 people, has been particularly outspoken about its success in his state. ""Thank God we expanded Medicaid because that Medicaid money is helping to rehab people,"" Mr. Kasich said during a bill signing in January. There is still a long way to go. Waiting lists for treatment persist, and many people still lack access, particularly in the 19 states that have opted not to expand Medicaid. Nationwide, 78 people die every day from opioid overdoses, according to the surgeon general, and the number is still rising. And paradoxically, even as the number of opioid prescriptions in the United States has finally started falling, expanded health coverage has probably made it easier for some people to obtain the drugs. ""There's no doubt in my mind that improving access to health care during an era in which opioids are being overprescribed would lead to more addiction,"" said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, the director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing and an addiction specialist. While 23 million Americans suffer from a substance use disorder, the surgeon general said in a report last year that only one in 10 was receiving treatment as of 2014, the first year people got coverage through the health law. ""Now what we're doing is playing catch-up,"" said Michael Botticelli, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy during the last two years of the Obama administration. In the past, a third of private insurance plans sold on the individual market did not cover addiction treatment, according to federal health officials, and those that did imposed strict limits. Medicaid covered little besides inpatient detox. Now, more health care providers are offering and getting reimbursed for outpatient counseling and medications like Suboxone and Vivitrol, which have been shown to reduce the potential for relapse.

This is a big improvement from the days when treatment typically was offered through scattered, poorly funded stand-alone clinics that did not necessarily provide evidence-based treatment and had long waiting lists, said Richard Frank, a professor of health economics at Harvard Medical School. ""The whole system is being pushed more toward looking like modern health care,"" said Dr. Frank, who worked at the Department of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration. The 21st Century Cures Act, which Congress passed in December with strong bipartisan support, could build on the progress by providing $1 billion nationwide over the next two years to expand drug treatment around the country, with an emphasis on medication-assisted treatment. The federal government will soon begin distributing the money to states, which will allot it to treatment programs, particularly in high-need areas. But if people lose their insurance, Dr. Frank said, they may well lose access to these new options. In Kentucky about 11,000 people were receiving addiction treatment through Medicaid by mid-2016, up sharply from 1,500 people in early 2014, according to the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky, a health policy research group. In West Virginia, Ms. Rosenberg of the National Council for Behavioral Health said, her group's member organizations -- nonprofit providers of mental health and addiction treatment -- are now treating 30,000 people a year, up from 9,000 before the health law. Here in New Hampshire -- which Mr. Trump won resoundingly in the Republican primary and lost by a hair in November -- more than 10,000 people have received addiction treatment after gaining coverage through the Medicaid expansion, said Michele Merritt, senior vice president and policy director at New Futures, a nonprofit advocacy group. Small treatment centers throughout the state that had never been able to bill insurance before have started doing so, she said, allowing them to hire more counselors and accept more patients. ""We're just beginning to implement these exchanges in a way that people know about them,"" said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, referring to the exchanges created under the health law. Getting rid of them, she said, ""makes no sense.""

In Pennsylvania, where 124,000 people have received addiction treatment under the Medicaid expansion, health officials were disturbed by early data showing that two-thirds of those who went to detox got no other treatment services. So Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, is designating 45 ""Centers of Excellence"" -- primary care clinics where people can also get addiction and mental health treatment, with frequent follow-up and a team of providers closely tracking their progress. The new model is in use here at the Manchester Community Health Center, where Mr. Diaz receives treatment. The center had offered minimal services for substance abuse before the health law. Now, three years later, it has undergone substantial changes. More than 40 percent of its patients had been uninsured; today, only 20 percent are. The center used to have one building, a staff of 55 and 7,500 patients; today, it has clinics in four locations, a staff of 230 and more than 16,000 patients, about 800 of whom have substance abuse issues. It has two providers who are licensed to prescribe medication-assisted treatment, which it is expanding to 60 patients, including pregnant women, the center's priority. ""The number may sound low as far as how many we're treating,"" said Julie Hazell-Felch, director of behavioral health at the center. ""But it's a multitude of services they're receiving and they're in here weekly,"" she said, seeing nurses, a behavioral health clinician and a medical provider, and giving urine samples and receiving their medications. If the Affordable Care Act is repealed, the center stands to lose more than $6 million in funding, mostly Medicaid revenue, about a third of its $18 million annual budget. ""We would not be able to keep all four sites open,"" said Kris McCracken, president and chief executive of the health center. She added: ""There are only two avenues to go: You either prevent and treat, or you street. That's what will happen. People will end up back on the street.""","Seeing progress in the fight against the nation's opioid epidemic, many providers are frustrated that the Affordable Care Act may be dismantled.",18b43d62-10d8-5209-bb50-bdab4e7e33e9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/11/us/11OPIOID-ACA1/11OPIOID-ACA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=2dc8fd2d6896a69313e2856879b92d2bc228b8c29d5e19f7999eac1ab329c9c6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"An opioid user in Rainelle, W.Va.

While 23 million Americans suffer from a substance use disorder, the surgeon general said in a report last year that only one in 10 was receiving treatment as of 2014, the first year people got coverage through the health law. ""Now what we're doing is playing catch-up,"" said Michael Botticelli, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy during the last two years of the Obama administration. In the past, a third of private insurance plans sold on the individual market did not cover addiction treatment, according to federal health officials, and those that did imposed strict limits. Medicaid covered little besides inpatient detox. Now, more health care providers are offering and getting reimbursed for outpatient counseling and medications like Suboxone and Vivitrol, which have been shown to reduce the potential for relapse.

This is a big improvement from the days when treatment typically was offered through scattered, poorly funded stand-alone clinics that did not necessarily provide evidence-based treatment and had long waiting lists, said Richard Frank, a professor of health economics at Harvard Medical School. ""The whole system is being pushed more toward looking like modern health care,"" said Dr. Frank, who worked at the Department of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration. The 21st Century Cures Act, which Congress passed in December with strong bipartisan support, could build on the progress by providing $1 billion nationwide over the next two years to expand drug treatment around the country, with an emphasis on medication-assisted treatment. The federal government will soon begin distributing the money to states, which will allot it to treatment programs, particularly in high-need areas. But if people lose their insurance, Dr. Frank said, they may well lose access to these new options. In Kentucky about 11,000 people were receiving addiction treatment through Medicaid by mid-2016, up sharply from 1,500 people in early 2014, according to the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky, a health policy research group. In West Virginia, Ms. Rosenberg of the National Council for Behavioral Health said, her group's member organizations -- nonprofit providers of mental health and addiction treatment -- are now treating 30,000 people a year, up from 9,000 before the health law. Here in New Hampshire -- which Mr. Trump won resoundingly in the Republican primary and lost by a hair in November -- more than 10,000 people have received addiction treatment after gaining coverage through the Medicaid expansion, said Michele Merritt, senior vice president and policy director at New Futures, a nonprofit advocacy group. Small treatment centers throughout the state that had never been able to bill insurance before have started doing so, she said, allowing them to hire more counselors and accept more patients. ""We're just beginning to implement these exchanges in a way that people know about them,"" said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, referring to the exchanges created under the health law. Getting rid of them, she said, ""makes no sense.""

In Pennsylvania, where 124,000 people have received addiction treatment under the Medicaid expansion, health officials were disturbed by early data showing that two-thirds of those who went to detox got no other treatment services. So Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, is designating 45 ""Centers of Excellence"" -- primary care clinics where people can also get addiction and mental health treatment, with frequent follow-up and a team of providers closely tracking their progress. The new model is in use here at the Manchester Community Health Center, where Mr. Diaz receives treatment. The center had offered minimal services for substance abuse before the health law. Now, three years later, it has undergone substantial changes. More than 40 percent of its patients had been uninsured; today, only 20 percent are. The center used to have one building, a staff of 55 and 7,500 patients; today, it has clinics in four locations, a staff of 230 and more than 16,000 patients, about 800 of whom have substance abuse issues. It has two providers who are licensed to prescribe medication-assisted treatment, which it is expanding to 60 patients, including pregnant women, the center's priority. ""The number may sound low as far as how many we're treating,"" said Julie Hazell-Felch, director of behavioral health at the center. ""But it's a multitude of services they're receiving and they're in here weekly,"" she said, seeing nurses, a behavioral health clinician and a medical provider, and giving urine samples and receiving their medications. If the Affordable Care Act is repealed, the center stands to lose more than $6 million in funding, mostly Medicaid revenue, about a third of its $18 million annual budget. ""We would not be able to keep all four sites open,"" said Kris McCracken, president and chief executive of the health center. She added: ""There are only two avenues to go: You either prevent and treat, or you street. That's what will happen. People will end up back on the street."" Seeing progress in the fight against the nation's opioid epidemic, many providers are frustrated that the Affordable Care Act may be dismantled.",,"Addiction Treatment Grew Under Health Law. Now What? MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Chad Diaz began using heroin when he was 12. Now 36 and newly covered by Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, he is on Suboxone, a substitute opioid that eases withdrawal symptoms and cravings, and he is slowly pulling himself together. ""This is the best my life has gone in many, many years,"" Mr. Diaz, a big man wearing camouflage, said as he sat in a community health center here. If Congress and President Trump succeed in dismantling the Affordable Care Act, he will have no insurance to pay for his medication or counseling, and he fears he will slide back to heroin. ""If this gets taken from me, it's right back to Square 1,"" he said. ""And that's not a good place. I'm scary when I'm using. I don't care who I hurt.""

As the debate over the fate of the health law intensifies, proponents have focused on the lifesaving care it has brought to people with cancer, diabetes and other physical illnesses. But the law has also had a profound, though perhaps less heralded, effect on mental health and addiction treatment, vastly expanding access to those services by designating them as ""essential benefits"" that must be covered through the A.C.A. marketplaces and expanded Medicaid. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group, calculates that 2.8 million people with substance use disorders, including 220,000 with opioid disorders, have coverage under the A.C.A. As the opioid epidemic continues to devastate communities nationwide, public health officials say the law has begun to make a critical difference in their ability to treat and rehabilitate people.

""Of all the illnesses, this is one where we've seen very dramatic changes and where we stand to lose the most ground if we lose the A.C.A.,"" said Linda Rosenberg, president and chief executive of the National Council for Behavioral Health, adding that treatment programs have begun to be integrated into primary care clinics and health care systems nationwide. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to rid the country of Obamacare but also to address the opioid epidemic and expand access to drug treatment. Many of the states hardest hit by opioids -- including Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky -- voted for Mr. Trump, but some Republican governors have expressed concern about what might happen to people being treated for addiction if their party repeals or scales back the health law.

John Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio, where the Medicaid expansion has covered 700,000 people, has been particularly outspoken about its success in his state. ""Thank God we expanded Medicaid because that Medicaid money is helping to rehab people,"" Mr. Kasich said during a bill signing in January. There is still a long way to go. Waiting lists for treatment persist, and many people still lack access, particularly in the 19 states that have opted not to expand Medicaid. Nationwide, 78 people die every day from opioid overdoses, according to the surgeon general, and the number is still rising. And paradoxically, even as the number of opioid prescriptions in the United States has finally started falling, expanded health coverage has probably made it easier for some people to obtain the drugs. ""There's no doubt in my mind that improving access to health care during an era in which opioids are being overprescribed would lead to more addiction,"" said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, the director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing and an addiction specialist.

And he uses words as the sea uses waves, to flow and beat, advance and retreat, rise and take a bow in disappearing.

In ""Notes of a Native Son,"" James Baldwin surveys in pungent commentary certain phases of the contemporary scene as they relate to the citizenry of the United States, particularly Negroes.

After initially refusing to testify in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee in regards to potential Russian interference in the 2016 election, Donald Trump Jr. has agreed to answer a specific set of questions in a certain amount of time.

""The president's eldest son, Don Jr. -- DJTJ -- has reached a deal to appear before the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee next month to try to convince them he doesn't know anything. For him, how hard could that be?"" -- JIMMY KIMMEL ""It will be a closed-door session, which is a shame but these are some of the questions he is expected to be asked: What happened in the Trump Tower meeting? What was your father's involvement in Trump Tower Moscow? Did you lie to Congress? What the hell is up with that beard? How do you strap a bicycle helmet without a chin?"" -- JIMMY KIMMEL ""After weeks of ignoring their subpoena, last night, Junior struck a deal for a limited interview with the Intelligence Committee. To be fair, every meeting with Don Jr. involves limited intelligence."" -- STEPHEN COLBERT ""Donald Trump Jr. agreed to testify before a Senate committee, but only for a maximum of four hours. Apparently, that's as long as Don Jr. can leave Eric outside in the car."" -- JIMMY FALLON ""I heard that Don Jr.'s testimony will be done in private, so it will not be on TV. The president was like, 'You lost me at Don Jr. and then you lost me again at not on TV.'"" -- JIMMY FALLON

""I think it's fair to say that this is the most restrictive law of its kind in America, which is why it barely squeaked by in the Alabama senate 25-6, with all 25 votes cast in favor coming from Republican men, though it may be the last time those Republican men will be coming for a while."" -- STEPHEN COLBERT ""To put it in perspective for you male senators, it would be like if cops showed up every time you miracle whipped into your wife's good towels and accused you of genocide except different because you never wanted to bring your shame tadpoles to term."" -- SAMANTHA BEE ""Tonight we also have music from Of Monsters and Men. Not only is Of Monsters and Men a great name for a band, but it's also how most women describe the Alabama Senate."" -- JIMMY FALLON ""It looks like that world's hardest game of Guess Who, doesn't it? 'Does he have a tie? Is he old? Yep!' They're deciding women's rights and then they'll pick the nominees for this year's B.E.T. awards, so it should be very exciting."" -- JIMMY FALLON ""That is either an overreach by the Alabama G.O.P. or some pretty intense viral marketing for the new season of 'The Handmaid's Tale,'"" Colbert said Wednesday night.",3,['3'],3
Health,"Baby Was Infected With Coronavirus in Womb, Study Reports",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/health/coronavirus-pregnancy-covid-19.html,"Researchers on Tuesday reported strong evidence that the coronavirus can be transmitted from a pregnant woman to a fetus. A baby born in a Paris hospital in March to a mother with Covid-19 tested positive for the virus and developed symptoms of inflammation in his brain, said Dr. Daniele De Luca, who led the research team and is chief of the division of pediatrics and neonatal critical care at Paris-Saclay University Hospitals. The baby, now more than 3 months old, recovered without treatment and is ""very much improved, almost clinically normal,"" Dr. De Luca said, adding that the mother, who needed oxygen during the delivery, is healthy. Dr. De Luca said the virus appeared to have been transmitted through the placenta of the 23-year-old mother. Since the pandemic began, there have been isolated cases of newborns who have tested positive for the coronavirus, but there has not been enough evidence to rule out the possibility that the infants became infected by the mother after they were born, experts said. A recently published case in Texas, of a newborn who tested positive for Covid-19 and had mild respiratory symptoms, provided more convincing evidence that transmission of the virus during pregnancy can occur.

In the Paris case, Dr. De Luca said, the team was able to test the placenta, amniotic fluid, cord blood, and the mother's and baby's blood. The testing indicated that ""the virus reaches the placenta and replicates there,"" Dr. De Luca said. It can then be transmitted to a fetus, which ""can get infected and have symptoms similar to adult Covid-19 patients."" A study of the case was published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications. Dr. Yoel Sadovsky, executive director of Magee-Womens Research Institute at the University of Pittsburgh, who was not involved in the study, said he thought the claim of placental transmission was ""fairly convincing."" He said the relatively high levels of the coronavirus found in the placenta and the rising levels of virus in the baby and the evidence of placental inflammation, along with the baby's symptoms, ""are all consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection."" Still, Dr. Sadovsky said, it is important to note that cases of possible coronavirus transmission in utero appear to be extremely rare. With other viruses, including Zika and rubella, placental infection and transmission is much more common, he said. With the coronavirus, he said, ""we are trying to understand the opposite -- what underlies the relative protection of the fetus and the placenta?"" Another study published on Tuesday in eLife, an online research journal, may help answer that question. It found that while cells in the placenta had many of the receptor proteins that allow viruses to propagate, there was evidence of only ""negligible"" amounts of a key cell surface receptor and an enzyme that are known to be involved in allowing the coronavirus to enter cells and replicate. The study was led by Dr. Robert Romero, chief of the perinatology research branch at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

The report from doctors in Paris said that the woman was 35 weeks pregnant when she came to the hospital with a fever and a cough that she developed a couple of days earlier in what was an otherwise healthy pregnancy. She tested positive for the coronavirus. After three days, fetal heart monitoring indicated signs of distress, and the baby was delivered by emergency cesarean section. The baby was placed in the neonatal intensive care unit and was connected to a ventilator for about six hours, the authors reported. He seemed to be doing well, but on his third day he became irritable, had trouble feeding and was experiencing muscle spasms and rigidity. A brain scan showed some injury to the white matter, which Dr. De Luca said resembled symptoms of meningitis or inflammation in the brain. He tested negative for other viruses or bacterial infections that could have caused such symptoms, while tests of his blood and fluid from his lungs were positive for coronavirus infection, the authors said. The baby gradually recovered and left the hospital after 18 days. The authors said that the highest levels of the coronavirus were found in the placenta, higher than those in the amniotic fluid and in the blood of the mother and baby, which Dr. De Luca said suggested that the virus might be able to replicate in placental cells. Dr. De Luca, who is also the president-elect of the European Society for Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care, said his team was analyzing other suspected cases of placental transmission of the coronavirus. ""This will be helpful for clinicians and policymakers in order to manage pregnant women, check neonates and reduce the risk of viral transmission from mothers to neonates,"" he said, adding, ""The good news is that the baby recovered spontaneously and gradually despite all this, and this confirms that the disease is milder in early infancy.""",Researchers said the case strongly suggests that Covid-19 can be transmitted in utero.

Travel,Denver's Vintage Train Station Gets (Another) Update,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/travel/denver-train-union-station.html,"In Denver's Union Station, the Great Hall, a grand public foyer, is unlike most bench-filled waiting rooms. On a recent visit, clusters of friends shared cocktails after work, mobile office workers tapped at computers from a library table, backpackers lounged on sofas, diners grabbed upscale burgers and one homeless man enjoyed the comfort of a wingback chair. The 1914-vintage downtown landmark underwent a $54 million renovation completed in 2014 that filled the sprawling, blocklong station with a roster of restaurants and bars by some of Denver's top chefs, branches of local shops and a stylish 112-room boutique hotel, all while preserving its use as an Amtrak station. As of April 22, the station took on a new role as the city's transportation heart when the electric commuter rail line from Denver International Airport, 22.8 miles east, began making the 37-minute trip into the city. The station is the focal point of a $500 million project to reorder Denver's transit system, creating a hub for Amtrak, additional light-rail lines throughout the city (three are expected to open this year) and local and national bus services. Currently an estimated 30,000 commuters and visitors use Union Station daily. With the introduction of the new airport train, named the University of Colorado A Line, management expects traffic will climb to 104,000 people daily by year's end.

""Rail built this town back in the day, and it's fun to see it's sustaining it again,"" said Nate Currey, spokesman for Denver's Regional Transportation District, which is overseeing the transportation plan. Since the airport opened in 1995, officials have been working to link it via rail, and Union Station, down to about two trains a day at its slowest and virtually abandoned, was a natural end point. ""We were dreaming in the '90s of the possibility of turning Union Station into a hotel, but we realized it needed to be more than a hotel, rather a community hub for people who lived, worked in and visited Denver to come together,"" said Walter Isenberg, chief executive of Sage Hospitality, which manages the station's new hotel, the Crawford, and is a member of the Union Station Alliance, which refurbished the building. ""Early on we said the Great Hall needs to become Denver's living room.""

On either side of the central hall, two long wings house shops and restaurants. The shops include a branch of Denver's beloved Tattered Cover Book Store (tatteredcover.com) and the gift shop 5 Green Boxes (5greenboxes.com).

Upstairs, spread over three levels, lies the Crawford Hotel (thecrawfordhotel.com) with 112 rooms ranging from narrow Pullman rooms, named after the historic train cars, overlooking the tracks, to more elaborate loftlike suites with exposed beams and freestanding bathtubs. The Crawford, which offers tours of the station on most Fridays, also runs the station's most elegant bar, the Cooper Lounge, located on the mezzanine level and overlooking the station's Great Hall beneath striking arched windows.

Economy,U.S. Hit a Record for Exports in April,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/business/economy/10econ.html,"The American trade deficit shrank unexpectedly in April after the United States sold $175.6 billion in goods and services overseas, the most exports on record, the government reported on Thursday.

The Commerce Department report said that exports of goods were $126.4 billion and services $49.1 billion, while total imports were $219.2 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of $43.7 billion, the lowest since December. The deficit in March was revised down to $46.8 billion from $48.2 billion, the department said.

The gap had been forecast by some economists to widen to $48.8 billion.

Media,Planned Sale of the Weinstein Company Collapses Again,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/business/media/weinstein-company-sale.html,"LOS ANGELES -- The planned sale of the Weinstein Company collapsed yet again on Tuesday, when the investor group that had agreed to purchase the embattled studio said that it had called off the deal after receiving ""disappointing information."" The investor group, led by Maria Contreras-Sweet, who ran the Small Business Administration under President Barack Obama, and the Weinstein Company's board announced last week that an agreement to buy most of the assets of the near-bankrupt studio had finally been reached. The deal called for the group to pay off the Weinstein Company's debt, which it believed totaled around $225 million. In return, the group would receive the majority of the studio's assets, which include ""Project Runway"" and a 277-film library. But once the buyers began looking deeper into the Weinstein Company's finances, they discovered that it had more debt than they had been led to believe, according to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential information. Additional liabilities totaling between $55 million and $65 million were discovered, including $27 million in unpaid residuals and profit participation; and $20 million in accounts payable. The Weinstein Company's board said in a statement that it was ""disappointed"" by the investors' decision to pull out of the agreement.

""The investors' excuse that they learned new information about the company's financial condition is just that -- an excuse,"" the board said. ""The company has been transparent about its dire financial condition."" The board vowed that it would not stop trying to find a way to avoid bankruptcy. ""We will continue to work tirelessly -- as we have for months -- to determine if there are any viable options,"" it said. Ms. Contreras-Sweet declined to discuss the decision beyond a statement issued by the investor group, which included the billionaire Ron Burkle, who has a long history with the Weinstein Company, and Lantern Capital, a Texas private-equity firm. ""I believe that our vision to create a women-led film studio is still the correct course of action,"" Ms. Contreras-Sweet said in the statement. ""To that end, we will consider acquiring assets that may become available in the event of bankruptcy proceedings, as well as other opportunities that may become available in the entertainment industry."" Ms. Contreras-Sweet went on to thank numerous parties, including Mr. Burkle and Tarak Ben Ammar, a Franco-Tunisian financier and film producer who is one of three remaining members of the Weinstein Company's board. Conspicuously absent were the other two: Lance Maerov, an executive at the advertising giant WPP Group, and the co-owner Bob Weinstein, who has been struggling to keep the studio afloat since October, when The New York Times and The New Yorker disclosed decades of sexual harassment allegations against his brother, Harvey Weinstein.

The on-again, off-again effort by Ms. Contreras-Sweet's group to buy most of the Weinstein Company's assets encountered its first major snag last month. Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, filed a lawsuit against the company and the Weinstein brothers on Feb. 11 alleging that they had violated state and city laws barring gender discrimination, sexual harassment and coercion.
* How Theranos changed tech coverage: 'You can't just buy what they're selling.'
* One meme stock lawsuit against Robinhood is dismissed, but others loom. At the time, Mr. Schneiderman said that the deal being discussed between Ms. Contreras-Sweet and the Weinstein Company was unacceptable because it did not adequately compensate victims, protect employees and ensure that those who enabled or perpetuated Mr. Weinstein's conduct would not be rewarded. The Weinstein Company and the investor group moved to address those concerns, but the studio's board announced on Feb. 25 that it would file for bankruptcy because Ms. Contreras-Sweet had not delivered on a promise to fund the studio's operations until a transaction was completed. Mr. Schneiderman got the deal back on track late last week, when he hosted a meeting between the two sides at his offices. He did so after the buyers and sellers had committed to terms that satisfied his concerns. The deal reached in that meeting, for instance, included a victims' fund worth up to $90 million. Harvey and Bob Weinstein, who jointly own about 42 percent of the Weinstein Company, would receive no cash from the sale. Amy Spitalnick, the press secretary for the attorney general, said in a statement on Tuesday that Mr. Schneiderman's lawsuit against the Weinstein Company and the Weinstein brothers remained active and an investigation into wrongdoings at the studio was ongoing. The attorney general's office also did not rule out the possibility that an already protracted sale process could have further twists.

Real Estate,"In Las Vegas, a Lucky Streak for Developers",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/realestate/commercial/in-las-vegas-a-lucky-streak-for-developers.html,"It wasn't too long ago that the Las Vegas Strip resembled a red-hot craps table right after the dice came up seven, sweeping all the chips to the house. When the financial crisis shut off capital, billions of dollars wagered on casino resort and high-rise condominium developments vanished from the Strip. But investors are once again placing chips on a 4.2-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard South, despite remaining scars like the steel skeleton of the halted St. Regis Residences, shrouded in cloth between the Venetian and Palazzo resorts, and the nearly complete but long-vacant Fontainebleau condo project a few blocks to the north. Developers are plowing capital into new casinos, a 20,000-seat arena, convention space, property renovations and shopping and entertainment districts. MGM Resorts International, an operator of 10 major resorts in Las Vegas, is aiming to unlock value by spinning off 10 of its properties into a real estate investment trust, including the Mirage, Luxor and Mandalay Bay resorts and four other assets on the Strip. Land on or near the Strip controlled by lenders and hedge funds is attracting attention, said Michael Parks, first vice president with CBRE's Global Gaming Group in Las Vegas. A 60-acre parcel that sold for $10 million an acre for an ambitious but ill-fated mixed-use project known as Las Ramblas could fetch more than $3 million an acre today, up from its value of $1 million an acre a few years ago, he said.

""There's a renewed interest in Las Vegas as a safe place to make an investment,"" Mr. Parks said. ""But I think capital sources are still being cautious in terms of what projects they'll lend money to."" Similarly, high-rise condo sales have rebounded to the point that some ""mothballed"" projects are about to come to market, said Bob Hamrick, chief executive of Coldwell Banker Premier Realty in Las Vegas. That is partly because of the ability of bulk buyers to turn a profit by selling units at a steep discount to their original price, he added.

Record tourism, a push for more international visitors and heady lodging fundamentals are emboldening investors and developers. A record 41.1 million visitors trekked to Las Vegas in 2014 -- an increase of almost five million from the trough in 2009 -- and tourists have set a pace to surpass that this year, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. On the Strip, resort occupancy has hovered around 90 percent every month this year, and revenue per available room, a measure of hotel profitability, jumped 13.2 percent in September from a year earlier to $124.73, according to the organization. Earlier this year, the Malaysian gaming giant Genting Group began building its $4 billion Chinese-themed Resorts World Las Vegas on 87 acres abutting Circus Circus on the northern end of the Strip. It is the first major casino resort development undertaken since the crash, and when it opens in 2018, it will feature three hotel towers totaling about 3,200 rooms, along with conference, gaming, entertainment and luxury retail space.

The site was home to the celebrated Stardust Resort and Casino, but the longtime owner, Boyd Gaming, razed it in 2007 to make way for a $4 billion casino resort and shopping behemoth. The financial upheaval halted Boyd's construction early on, and Genting acquired the lot in 2013 for $350 million. ""One of the most attractive things about this property is that we're on the edge of what's probably the most dynamic end of the Strip right now in terms of potential growth,"" said Gerald Gardner, general counsel and senior vice president for government affairs with Resorts World Las Vegas. ""I think you're going to see some real clear and dramatic development."" The project sits across the street from the former Riviera Hotel and Casino, a roughly 2,000-room resort that closed in May after 60 years. The Las Vegas convention authority acquired the property for $182.5 million and plans to replace it with 1.4 million square feet of exhibit, meeting and support space. On 35 acres directly south of Resorts World Las Vegas, a division of Australian gaming and entertainment operator Crown Resorts plans to build Alon, a luxury casino resort of 1,110 rooms across the street from Wynn Las Vegas. The property, formerly home to the New Frontier Casino, was purchased for $1.2 billion in 2007 by the El-Ad Group, which demolished the New Frontier to make way for the $5 billion Las Vegas Plaza resort. It became another victim of the crash. Crown Resorts and Andrew Pascal, a former executive of Wynn, formed a new company that acquired the parcel last year for $280 million. ""Our belief is that people have a fascination with and a curiosity about Las Vegas,"" Mr. Pascal said. ""The city is enjoying a stable recovery, and that's why operating companies familiar with the market are starting to invest.""

Gambling contributed less than 37 percent of total resort revenue on the Strip last year, down from 58.6 percent 30 years ago, according to research by David G. Schwartz, director of the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Las Vegas. The data also indicate that lodging, dining, shopping and other nongambling entertainment like shows and events grew to 63.3 percent of total resort revenue, from 41.4 percent over the same period. In 2014, the Caesars Entertainment Corporation opened the Linq Promenade, an open-air retail, dining and entertainment district between the Flamingo and Linq Hotel and Casino (formerly The Quad and Imperial Palace). The project includes the 550-foot High Roller Las Vegas Ferris wheel. Farther south, MGM Resorts has partnered with AEG to build the $375 million Las Vegas Arena just west of the New York-New York and Monte Carlo resorts. The arena will open in early 2016, and in addition to hosting concerts and other events, developers anticipate that it will be home to a National Hockey League expansion team as early as the 2017-18 season. What is more, MGM Resorts is developing the Park, a $100 million outdoor shopping and entertainment plaza on more than six acres stretching from the Strip to the arena. It will also be adjacent to a new 5,000-seat theater in the Monte Carlo, a property that the company intends to reposition. To some degree, the Park is a nod to new urbanism and millennials, who like the Las Vegas nightclubs, restaurants and shops, said Bill Hornbuckle, president of MGM Resorts. But the popularity of alfresco dining and outdoor cafes, which are found on most major streets in the country, he added, has required a shift from the traditional philosophy governing gambling resort design. ""We're trying to open up the community to the outdoors; people enjoy not being constrained in the typical way that gaming used to be,"" Mr. Hornbuckle said. ""People will find a casino. We don't have to march you through it or capture you in it.""","Investors are once again placing chips on the Strip, a stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard South.",f4ae773a-324f-5983-b038-288684fc8f75,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/17/business/18vegas1/18vegas1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=86c82bdc2280fb85eba43009384d58481fba75a2c80af30932a54fa53a2497f6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A rendering of the $4 billion Resorts World Las Vegas, the first major casino resort development undertaken since the real estate crash.",f4ae773a-324f-5983-b038-288684fc8f75,Demo_data/D1_img2/1f4ae773a-324f-5983-b038-288684fc8f75.jpg,7,"In Las Vegas, a Lucky Streak for Developers It wasn't too long ago that the Las Vegas Strip resembled a red-hot craps table right after the dice came up seven, sweeping all the chips to the house.

Investors are once again placing chips on the Strip, a stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard South.",,"In Las Vegas, a Lucky Streak for Developers It wasn't too long ago that the Las Vegas Strip resembled a red-hot craps table right after the dice came up seven, sweeping all the chips to the house. When the financial crisis shut off capital, billions of dollars wagered on casino resort and high-rise condominium developments vanished from the Strip. But investors are once again placing chips on a 4.2-mile stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard South, despite remaining scars like the steel skeleton of the halted St. Regis Residences, shrouded in cloth between the Venetian and Palazzo resorts, and the nearly complete but long-vacant Fontainebleau condo project a few blocks to the north. Developers are plowing capital into new casinos, a 20,000-seat arena, convention space, property renovations and shopping and entertainment districts. MGM Resorts International, an operator of 10 major resorts in Las Vegas, is aiming to unlock value by spinning off 10 of its properties into a real estate investment trust, including the Mirage, Luxor and Mandalay Bay resorts and four other assets on the Strip. Land on or near the Strip controlled by lenders and hedge funds is attracting attention, said Michael Parks, first vice president with CBRE's Global Gaming Group in Las Vegas. A 60-acre parcel that sold for $10 million an acre for an ambitious but ill-fated mixed-use project known as Las Ramblas could fetch more than $3 million an acre today, up from its value of $1 million an acre a few years ago, he said.

""There's a renewed interest in Las Vegas as a safe place to make an investment,"" Mr. Parks said. ""But I think capital sources are still being cautious in terms of what projects they'll lend money to."" Similarly, high-rise condo sales have rebounded to the point that some ""mothballed"" projects are about to come to market, said Bob Hamrick, chief executive of Coldwell Banker Premier Realty in Las Vegas. That is partly because of the ability of bulk buyers to turn a profit by selling units at a steep discount to their original price, he added.

Record tourism, a push for more international visitors and heady lodging fundamentals are emboldening investors and developers. A record 41.1 million visitors trekked to Las Vegas in 2014 -- an increase of almost five million from the trough in 2009 -- and tourists have set a pace to surpass that this year, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. On the Strip, resort occupancy has hovered around 90 percent every month this year, and revenue per available room, a measure of hotel profitability, jumped 13.2 percent in September from a year earlier to $124.73, according to the organization. Earlier this year, the Malaysian gaming giant Genting Group began building its $4 billion Chinese-themed Resorts World Las Vegas on 87 acres abutting Circus Circus on the northern end of the Strip. It is the first major casino resort development undertaken since the crash, and when it opens in 2018, it will feature three hotel towers totaling about 3,200 rooms, along with conference, gaming, entertainment and luxury retail space.

The site was home to the celebrated Stardust Resort and Casino, but the longtime owner, Boyd Gaming, razed it in 2007 to make way for a $4 billion casino resort and shopping behemoth. The financial upheaval halted Boyd's construction early on, and Genting acquired the lot in 2013 for $350 million. ""One of the most attractive things about this property is that we're on the edge of what's probably the most dynamic end of the Strip right now in terms of potential growth,"" said Gerald Gardner, general counsel and senior vice president for government affairs with Resorts World Las Vegas. ""I think you're going to see some real clear and dramatic development."" The project sits across the street from the former Riviera Hotel and Casino, a roughly 2,000-room resort that closed in May after 60 years. The Las Vegas convention authority acquired the property for $182.5 million and plans to replace it with 1.4 million square feet of exhibit, meeting and support space. On 35 acres directly south of Resorts World Las Vegas, a division of Australian gaming and entertainment operator Crown Resorts plans to build Alon, a luxury casino resort of 1,110 rooms across the street from Wynn Las Vegas. The property, formerly home to the New Frontier Casino, was purchased for $1.2 billion in 2007 by the El-Ad Group, which demolished the New Frontier to make way for the $5 billion Las Vegas Plaza resort. It became another victim of the crash. Crown Resorts and Andrew Pascal, a former executive of Wynn, formed a new company that acquired the parcel last year for $280 million. ""Our belief is that people have a fascination with and a curiosity about Las Vegas,"" Mr. Pascal said. ""The city is enjoying a stable recovery, and that's why operating companies familiar with the market are starting to invest.""

Gambling contributed less than 37 percent of total resort revenue on the Strip last year, down from 58.6 percent 30 years ago, according to research by David G. Schwartz, director of the Center for Gaming Research at the University of Las Vegas. The data also indicate that lodging, dining, shopping and other nongambling entertainment like shows and events grew to 63.3 percent of total resort revenue, from 41.4 percent over the same period. In 2014, the Caesars Entertainment Corporation opened the Linq Promenade, an open-air retail, dining and entertainment district between the Flamingo and Linq Hotel and Casino (formerly The Quad and Imperial Palace). The project includes the 550-foot High Roller Las Vegas Ferris wheel. Farther south, MGM Resorts has partnered with AEG to build the $375 million Las Vegas Arena just west of the New York-New York and Monte Carlo resorts. The arena will open in early 2016, and in addition to hosting concerts and other events, developers anticipate that it will be home to a National Hockey League expansion team as early as the 2017-18 season. What is more, MGM Resorts is developing the Park, a $100 million outdoor shopping and entertainment plaza on more than six acres stretching from the Strip to the arena. It will also be adjacent to a new 5,000-seat theater in the Monte Carlo, a property that the company intends to reposition. To some degree, the Park is a nod to new urbanism and millennials, who like the Las Vegas nightclubs, restaurants and shops, said Bill Hornbuckle, president of MGM Resorts. But the popularity of alfresco dining and outdoor cafes, which are found on most major streets in the country, he added, has required a shift from the traditional philosophy governing gambling resort design. ""We're trying to open up the community to the outdoors; people enjoy not being constrained in the typical way that gaming used to be,"" Mr. Hornbuckle said. ""People will find a casino. We don't have to march you through it or capture you in it."" Investors are once again placing chips on the Strip, a stretch of Las Vegas Boulevard South.",7,['7'],7
Technology,Groups in Myanmar Fire Back at Zuckerberg,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/technology/zuckerberg-facebook-myanmar.html,"SHANGHAI -- Civil society groups in Myanmar on Thursday criticized Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, arguing that he mischaracterized his company's effectiveness at detecting and quashing messages encouraging violence in the country. Taking aim at comments Mr. Zuckerberg made in a recent interview, the groups said that Facebook had no consistent methods for dealing with hate speech in Myanmar. The same problems keep recurring, they said, with the company routinely failing to follow up on their comments and suggestions. In a conversation with Ezra Klein of Vox this week, Mr. Zuckerberg referred to a pair of chain letters that were widely shared in Myanmar on Facebook Messenger last year. One message warned Buddhist groups about an imminent attack by Muslims, expected on Sept. 11. The other, spread among Muslims, cautioned of violence from Buddhist nationalists on the same date. ""So that's the kind of thing where I think it is clear that people were trying to use our tools in order to incite real harm,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said. ""Now, in that case, our systems detect that that's going on. We stop those messages from going through.""

In an open letter, the organizations, which have worked with Facebook to flag dangerous and misleading content, including the chain letters, said the messages had spread for days, caused widespread fear and set off at least three violent incidents. They also said there was no system at all, only a group of organizations and volunteers doing their best to keep up with a torrent of vitriol.

""In your interview, you refer to your detection 'systems.' We believe your system, in this case, was us -- and we were far from systematic,"" the letter says. ""From where we stand, this case exemplifies the very opposite of effective moderation: It reveals an overreliance on third parties, a lack of a proper mechanism for emergency escalation, a reticence to engage local stakeholders around systemic solutions and a lack of transparency."" Facebook responded to the criticism in a satement on Friday. ""We are sorry that Mark did not make clearer that it was the civil society groups in Myanmar who first reported these messages,"" it said. ""We took their reports very seriously and immediately investigated ways to help prevent the spread of this content. We should have been faster, and are working hard to improve our technology and tools to detect and prevent abusive, hateful or false content.""

Myanmar highlights existential questions about Facebook's mission and responsibilities. The site has closely connected people in the country -- in many cases, Facebook is the only online service they use. It has also become a major channel for the spread of hate speech and propaganda that has encouraged and obfuscated ethnic cleansing of the country's Muslim Rohingya, according to human rights groups. Almost 700,000 Rohingya have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since last summer, when the military started a crackdown in the country's western Rakhine State. Last month, United Nations investigators said Facebook played a role in spreading hate speech that incited violence against the Rohingya. For Mr. Zuckerberg, the timing of the letter is bad. Both he and his top deputy, Sheryl Sandberg, are making multiple media appearances this week to address questions about how the company handles users' personal data. The company has faced harsh criticism for reports on how information about millions of users may have been improperly leaked to a political consulting firm connected to President Trump's 2016 campaign. The criticism has sent the company's stock tumbling. Next week, Mr. Zuckerberg is expected to appear at multiple congressional hearings. Among the half-dozen signatories of the letter posted on Thursday in Myanmar are Phandeeyar, a leading technology hub in the country that helped Facebook draft its Burmese-language community standards; Myanmar ICT for Development Organization, which monitors online hate speech; and the Center for Social Integrity.

""Presumably, your data team should be able to trace the original sources of flagged messages and posts and identify repeat offenders, using these insights to inform your moderation and sanctioning,"" the letter says. Myanmar is on the verge of civil war. Following a military coup on Feb. 1, unrest has been growing. Peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations have given way to insurgent uprisings against the Tatmadaw, the country's military, which ousted the country's civilian leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is a polarizing figure. The daughter of a hero of Myanmar's independence, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi remains very popular at home. Internationally, her reputation has been tarnished by her recent cooperation with the same military generals who ousted her. The coup ended a short span of quasi-democracy. In 2011, the Tatmadaw implemented parliamentary elections and other reforms. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi came to power as state councillor in 2016, becoming the country's de facto head of government. The coup was preceded by a contested election. In the Nov. 8 election, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's party won 83 percent of the body's available seats. The military, whose proxy party suffered a crushing defeat, refused to accept the results of the vote. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi could face time in prison. She was detained by the junta and secretly put on trial. If convicted of all 11 charges against her, which include ""inciting public unrest,"" she could be sentenced to a maximum of 102 years in prison. Jes Petersen, chief executive of Phandeeyar, said problematic messages in Myanmar were not a one-time problem. ""There's multiple cases of similar things that have happened where we've done everything we can to bring it to Facebook's attention but we don't see much happening on their end,"" he said. ""That's a big part of the problem."" Victoire Rio, a social media analyst in the country who previously worked at Phandeeyar, said another major issue was Facebook's lack of Burmese speakers for local monitors to communicate directly with. ""It's evident to us that there are not enough resources and not enough human resources dedicated to Myanmar,"" Ms. Rio said. She added that the company's Burmese-speaking reviewers were based in Dublin, and from the company's recruiting pages it seems it is struggling to find qualified candidates. The groups also faulted Facebook's lack of transparency. They said that after they had reported the messages that Mr. Zuckerberg cited in his interview, they heard nothing from the company about what happened or how Facebook would better respond.

Style,The Disrupters: Making New York's Cultural Boards More Diverse,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/31/style/diversity-cultural-boards-trustees-new-york.html,"Credit...Benjamin Norman for The New York Times





One morning last September, the billionaires Ronald Perelman and Jerry Speyer strolled into Carnegie Hall, but not to hear Yo-Yo Ma play Bach or Deborah Voigt sing Strauss. Instead, they sat among more than 40 of their colleagues with ties to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Wildlife Conservation Society, among other organizations, listening as Tom Finkelpearl, the cultural affairs commissioner of New York City, talked about the sector's lack of diversity. The numbers tell a stark story. The American Museum of Natural History has never had an African-American president or board chairman. Neither has MoMA, the Whitney or the Met. In a city where more than two-thirds of residents identify as nonwhite, according to the 2010 census, 78 percent of the board members serving its cultural institutions are white. On the board of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, the chairman, nine vice chairs and the treasurer are all white. According to Mr. Finkelpearl, he didn't want to steamroll anyone when he visited Carnegie Hall to discuss the issue.

During his talk, Mr. Finkelpearl, who was president of the Queens Museum before becoming cultural affairs chief in 2014, spoke of a city-commissioned study, then in the works from the nonprofit research firm Ithaka S&R, on the ethnic makeup of the various organizations' staffs, audiences and boards. ""If you've been to board meetings, the problem is easy to see,"" Mr. Finkelpearl said. If the mood in the hall was occasionally uncomfortable, as two people in attendance described it, it may have had something to do with the fact that Mr. Finkelpearl was there on behalf of Mayor Bill de Blasio, who, in his first two years in office, did not set foot in MoMA, the Studio Museum in Harlem, the Guggenheim or the Metropolitan Opera. Unlike his gala-hopping multibillionaire predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, Mr. de Blasio often seems out of his element among billionaires and society swans, and his absence from New York's palaces of high culture has not gone unnoticed.

Despite the apparent tension, a number of historically insular boards appear to be making some inroads where board diversity is concerned. Exhibit A? Carnegie Hall, which in June named Robert Smith, the 53-year-old African-American chief of Vista Equity Partners, as its new chairman. What a difference eight months can make. Board membership in New York has always been a rich person's game. In exchange for the social status and networking opportunities provided by the Met, MoMA, Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall, the bulk of trustees are expected to donate (or at least raise) hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. And until 1980, almost all of those who were on such boards were white. Never mind that the African-American contralto Marian Anderson made her Carnegie Hall debut roughly 50 years earlier. Never mind that Arthur Mitchell joined New York City Ballet in the 1950s. ""There is an artistic history at these institutions that was sometimes way ahead of their philanthropic histories,"" said Gordon Davis, who in 1978 became the city's first African-American parks commissioner, under Mayor Edward I. Koch.

In 1980, Mr. Davis, now a partner at Venable, co-founded the Central Park Conservancy, a nonprofit organization that manages the park in a partnership with the city. In its first year, there were seven nonwhite trustees on its board of 29, a ratio nearly unheard-of for such organizations. Still, the floodgates did not open: As recently as 2004, MoMA, Carnegie Hall and the American Museum of Natural History had one black trustee each. This was when things began to speed up, as a new generation of African-American business executives began deploying their considerable financial resources toward organizations that had looked about as integrated as a night at the opera, circa 1883. Most of these glass-ceiling breakers were born around the final days of segregation. Many went to Harvard for business or law degrees and raised money for Barack Obama. ""African-Americans do not have a long tradition of wealth like the Rockefellers, Vanderbilts or Whitneys,"" said Faye Wattleton, one of more than a dozen black board members of Jazz at Lincoln Center. ""We still are not at parity by any means. But there is an emerging class of significant wealth in the African-American community that is now in great demand.""

Today Ms. Golden is the director and chief curator of the Studio Museum, where Mr. McGuire is chairman of the board. Diversifying the leadership positions at the big cultural institutions south of Harlem has proved more elusive. ""For many years, I said: 'This just doesn't go. We serve a population,'"" said Agnes Gund, president emerita of MoMA, who is white and has helped lead efforts to make its board look more like New York. It wasn't a popular opinion. In the last decade, MoMA has gone from having one black trustee to having five, though some -- particularly those who come not from banking but from the arts or academia -- talk of their experiences on the board almost as if they are Prep for Prep students at a ritzy private school, apart from the Park Avenue kids. In June, MoMA hosted its annual Party in the Garden fund-raiser, where two of the three artists honored -- Mark Bradford and Huma Bhabha -- are black and Pakistani, respectively. But Khalil Gibran Muhammad, an African-American trustee recruited to the board in 2015 by its chairman, Mr. Speyer, said he couldn't pay for a $2,500 ticket on an academic's salary.

""It looked lovely,"" he said. ""I saw pictures."" On one hand, Dr. Muhammad, a professor of history at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard who formerly ran the New York Public Library Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, said he is pleased that MoMA is having what he called a ""very real and very frank conversation about the whiteness of its collections, both internationally and in terms of having African-Americans represented."" On the other, he worries about the focus on board diversity there and elsewhere obscuring the issue of what happens when a small group of wealthy patrons controls a large cultural nonprofit. ""I have not borne witness almost anywhere to people saying, 'This is not how things should be,'"" Dr. Muhammad said. Since joining the MoMA board in 2012, A C Hudgins, a black collector of African-American art, has flown on private planes in the company of fellow trustees, something he had never done before. He has invited trustees to his house for dinner, only to find himself amused and slightly disturbed when they told him how nice it was to clear their own plates afterward, as they had in their youths. ""I'm Negro rich, not MoMA rich,"" Mr. Hudgins said, laughing. ""If you look at the billionaires that keep coming onto this board, it's mind-boggling. Just mind-boggling."" But Mr. Hudgins has clearly added value to the museum. The museum on West 53rd Street now includes a trove of pieces by African-Americans that he donated, including works by Senga Nengudi, Henry Taylor and David Hammons.

In 2014, Debra Lee, the African-American C.E.O. of BET Networks (Harvard Law, 1980), was offered the president of the board position at Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. When she vacillated, Mr. Walker took her to dinner at SD26 in the Flatiron district. ""He didn't twist my arm too much,"" Ms. Lee said. ""But he said, 'You need to do this.'"" Mr. Walker even communicates with Ms. Lee, Ms. Burns, Mr. McGuire and Ms. Chase on an email chain of prominent black philanthropists (""the blutocrats!"" Mr. Walker joked) that includes Kenneth Chenault, the chief executive of American Express, and Dr. Tony Coles, a Met trustee and biotech entrepreneur who in 2013 sold his company, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, for $10 billion. Years ago, while on the board of Newtown Friends School, in Newtown, Pa., which his children attended, Dr. Coles heard a proverb: ""'Wealth or wisdom is usually the requirement,'"" he said, ""'and if you happen to have both, even better.'"" By the spring of 2015, a number of the city's other cultural institutions were showing signs that they were making a conscious decision to diversify their boards. The Metropolitan Museum of Art appointed three new trustees to the board, two of whom were nonwhite. On Lafayette Street, at the Public Theater, it was four out of five. ""This was no accident,"" said Mr. Davis, a longtime Public Theater board member who credited Arielle Tepper Madover, the nonprofit's chairwoman since 2013, for making its board was more in sync with its championing of nonwhite playwrights and performers. When Patrick Bradford, the first black partner at the law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, announced his plans to leave the Public Theater board, he suggested another prominent African-American replace him: Timothy Wilkins, who works in mergers and acquisitions at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, who had served on the Public Theater's Partners Program.

The board rushed to Mr. Gillinson's defense. Mr. Perelman resigned. When Mr. Perelman showed up at Carnegie Hall on Sept. 19 for the diversity symposium led by Mr. Finkelpearl, he and Mr. Gillinson sat as far apart as possible. As people sympathetic to Mr. Perelman tell it, the board was a boys club that avoided tension and disagreement, while it rubber-stamped projects with clear conflicts of interest, and ignored efforts to diversify the audience and programming. As people sympathetic to Mr. Gillinson cast the story, Mr. Perelman quit after making a Barnum-like play to alter Carnegie Hall's programming, reducing its focus on classical music and trying to sign R&B stars like Alicia Keys. Ms. Taylor did not deny that Mr. Perelman hoped to update the offerings, but she framed it as part of a larger pro-diversity plan. ""He didn't suggest Alicia Keys to dumb Carnegie Hall down,"" she said. ""He did it to bring in new people who might patronize it in the future."" Mercedes Bass took over as acting chairwoman with the aim that she would eventually assume the role in a long-term capacity, according to three board sources. Lawyers were brought in to investigate Mr. Perelman's claims and determined that Mr. Gillinson had acted in good faith. But that did not stop a number of its trustees that winter from voicing concern that Ms. Bass -- a white Upper East Side socialite -- may not be the person to carry Carnegie Hall into the future.

A better alternative, they argued, was Mr. Smith. For one, he had recently pledged $15 million to Carnegie Hall, through his Fund II Foundation, as well as $50 million to Cornell University's College of Engineering. He is also an African-American man with a love for classical music and sons named Hendrix (after Jimi) and Legend (after John), which positioned him to be a potential bridge between traditionalists and the more populist camp. The icing on the cake was that he had been recruited to the board in 2013 by Mr. Gillinson. After the formal announcement, Mr. Walker praised Mr. Smith's selection as ""a transformational moment in the life of the city."" In a rare interview, even Mr. Perelman offered measured praise. ""From my point of view, this is a step in the right direction,"" he said. ""I think he can have a fabulous effect, if he is allowed to."" But Dr. Muhammad, the former director of the Schomburg center, cautioned against seeing Mr. Smith's entry into New York cultural life as a sign that things will change in a meaningful way. ""White people are going to be wealthier on average, wealthier people are going to be in leadership positions more often, and in those positions they're likely to be part of a network of people in the same social milieu,"" Dr. Muhammad said. ""There'll continue to be people like Robert Smith, who happen to be African-American and do wonderful things, but there's a giant wealth gap between blacks and whites, and it's only widened in the wake of the great recession. Is this a sign of a trend that black people will be the heads of boards all over the country?

One morning last September, the billionaires Ronald Perelman and Jerry Speyer strolled into Carnegie Hall, but not to hear Yo-Yo Ma play Bach or Deborah Voigt sing Strauss. Instead, they sat among more than 40 of their colleagues with ties to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Wildlife Conservation Society, among other organizations, listening as Tom Finkelpearl, the cultural affairs commissioner of New York City, talked about the sector's lack of diversity. The numbers tell a stark story. The American Museum of Natural History has never had an African-American president or board chairman. Neither has MoMA, the Whitney or the Met. In a city where more than two-thirds of residents identify as nonwhite, according to the 2010 census, 78 percent of the board members serving its cultural institutions are white. On the board of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, the chairman, nine vice chairs and the treasurer are all white. According to Mr. Finkelpearl, he didn't want to steamroll anyone when he visited Carnegie Hall to discuss the issue.

During his talk, Mr. Finkelpearl, who was president of the Queens Museum before becoming cultural affairs chief in 2014, spoke of a city-commissioned study, then in the works from the nonprofit research firm Ithaka S&R, on the ethnic makeup of the various organizations' staffs, audiences and boards. ""If you've been to board meetings, the problem is easy to see,"" Mr. Finkelpearl said. If the mood in the hall was occasionally uncomfortable, as two people in attendance described it, it may have had something to do with the fact that Mr. Finkelpearl was there on behalf of Mayor Bill de Blasio, who, in his first two years in office, did not set foot in MoMA, the Studio Museum in Harlem, the Guggenheim or the Metropolitan Opera. Unlike his gala-hopping multibillionaire predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, Mr. de Blasio often seems out of his element among billionaires and society swans, and his absence from New York's palaces of high culture has not gone unnoticed.

Despite the apparent tension, a number of historically insular boards appear to be making some inroads where board diversity is concerned. Exhibit A? Carnegie Hall, which in June named Robert Smith, the 53-year-old African-American chief of Vista Equity Partners, as its new chairman. What a difference eight months can make. Board membership in New York has always been a rich person's game. In exchange for the social status and networking opportunities provided by the Met, MoMA, Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall, the bulk of trustees are expected to donate (or at least raise) hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. And until 1980, almost all of those who were on such boards were white. Never mind that the African-American contralto Marian Anderson made her Carnegie Hall debut roughly 50 years earlier. Never mind that Arthur Mitchell joined New York City Ballet in the 1950s. ""There is an artistic history at these institutions that was sometimes way ahead of their philanthropic histories,"" said Gordon Davis, who in 1978 became the city's first African-American parks commissioner, under Mayor Edward I. Koch.

In 1980, Mr. Davis, now a partner at Venable, co-founded the Central Park Conservancy, a nonprofit organization that manages the park in a partnership with the city. In its first year, there were seven nonwhite trustees on its board of 29, a ratio nearly unheard-of for such organizations. Still, the floodgates did not open: As recently as 2004, MoMA, Carnegie Hall and the American Museum of Natural History had one black trustee each. This was when things began to speed up, as a new generation of African-American business executives began deploying their considerable financial resources toward organizations that had looked about as integrated as a night at the opera, circa 1883. Most of these glass-ceiling breakers were born around the final days of segregation. Many went to Harvard for business or law degrees and raised money for Barack Obama. ""African-Americans do not have a long tradition of wealth like the Rockefellers, Vanderbilts or Whitneys,"" said Faye Wattleton, one of more than a dozen black board members of Jazz at Lincoln Center. ""We still are not at parity by any means. But there is an emerging class of significant wealth in the African-American community that is now in great demand.""

Today Ms. Golden is the director and chief curator of the Studio Museum, where Mr. McGuire is chairman of the board. Diversifying the leadership positions at the big cultural institutions south of Harlem has proved more elusive. ""For many years, I said: 'This just doesn't go. We serve a population,'"" said Agnes Gund, president emerita of MoMA, who is white and has helped lead efforts to make its board look more like New York. It wasn't a popular opinion. In the last decade, MoMA has gone from having one black trustee to having five, though some -- particularly those who come not from banking but from the arts or academia -- talk of their experiences on the board almost as if they are Prep for Prep students at a ritzy private school, apart from the Park Avenue kids. In June, MoMA hosted its annual Party in the Garden fund-raiser, where two of the three artists honored -- Mark Bradford and Huma Bhabha -- are black and Pakistani, respectively. But Khalil Gibran Muhammad, an African-American trustee recruited to the board in 2015 by its chairman, Mr. Speyer, said he couldn't pay for a $2,500 ticket on an academic's salary.

""It looked lovely,"" he said. ""I saw pictures."" On one hand, Dr. Muhammad, a professor of history at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard who formerly ran the New York Public Library Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, said he is pleased that MoMA is having what he called a ""very real and very frank conversation about the whiteness of its collections, both internationally and in terms of having African-Americans represented."" On the other, he worries about the focus on board diversity there and elsewhere obscuring the issue of what happens when a small group of wealthy patrons controls a large cultural nonprofit. ""I have not borne witness almost anywhere to people saying, 'This is not how things should be,'"" Dr. Muhammad said. Since joining the MoMA board in 2012, A C Hudgins, a black collector of African-American art, has flown on private planes in the company of fellow trustees, something he had never done before. He has invited trustees to his house for dinner, only to find himself amused and slightly disturbed when they told him how nice it was to clear their own plates afterward, as they had in their youths.

Real Estate,"Bridgewater, Conn.: No Supermarkets, but Natural Beauty to Spare",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/realestate/bridgewater-conn-no-supermarkets-but-natural-beauty-to-spare.html,"Theresa and Richard Miller hadn't even started house-hunting when they found the home in Bridgewater, Conn., that they moved into last year. Both were retired -- Ms. Miller, 55, from the hospitality industry; Mr. Miller, 58, from the New York City Police Department, where he served in the Emergency Service Unit. (Mr. Miller is the officer who raised the first American flag at ground zero the day after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.) The couple, who volunteer to support veterans and emergency medical workers, were ready for a change, but they worried that the townhome they had bought in nearby Brookfield and lived in for six years wouldn't sell. Then a 2,829-square-foot, four-bedroom Cape Cod popped up on Ms. Miller's computer. Perusing real estate websites was a pastime of hers, and that day she was searching in Bridgewater. ""I never thought Bridgewater would be in our budget,"" she said, ""but this house met all our criteria.""

That was in March 2017. The Millers sold their house several weeks later and closed on the Bridgewater property in May. They paid $439,000 for the house, which was built in 1992 on four wooded acres. ""Living here is a healing retreat,"" Ms. Miller said. ""Whenever I cross into Bridgewater on the bridge over Lake Lillinonah, I exhale, and in that moment, I feel like I'm home.""

In a recent study, the Yankee Institute for Public Policy ranked Bridgewater as the most fiscally healthy of Connecticut's 169 municipalities. The town's approximately 1,660 residents include affluent landowners, families who have farmed there for generations and people who work for both. Curtis Read, the town's first selectman, estimated that at least a quarter of the residents are second homeowners. ""We have some very wealthy people, and we have some people who get assistance from the town,"" he said. Aiming to combat declining enrollment in the schools, parents of school-age children have been working with the town to attract young families. Data gathered by the Connecticut Economic Resource Center showed that, in 2017, two-thirds of the people living in Bridgewater were over 45. ""This is a great place to retire,"" Mr. Read said. ""But we want more kids.""

Bridgewater is primarily residential, much of it zoned for two-, three- and four-acre lots, with colonials and Cape Cods, ranches and 19th-century antiques. Near the town center, clusters of homes on one-acre lots create a more neighborhood-like feel. Two state roads -- Routes 133 and 67 -- intersect at Bridgewater's only traffic light. Mr. Read said that 38 percent of the town is open space or farmland, some of it maintained by the Nature Conservancy, some by the Bridgewater Land Trust. Denise Pinter, Bridgewater's assessor, said the town has nearly 800 single-family houses and one condominium complex with 17 units. There are no multifamily homes, cooperatives or rental buildings.

""We have options from $200,000 to over $4 million,"" said Audrey Wilkicki, an agent with William Pitt Sotheby's International Realty. As for inventory, it is low, especially for houses priced under $350,000. ""We don't have a lot that first-time home buyers can afford,"" said Roberta Allen, an agent with William Raveis Real Estate. ""When those houses come on the market, they go quickly."" High-end sales are also active, but Ms. Allen described the midrange market -- between $750,000 and $1 million -- as ""languishing."" According to Connecticut's SmartMLS, as of Sept. 7 there were 25 single-family houses on the market, from a two-bedroom, 943-square-foot Cape Cod, built in 1856 on a quarter of an acre, listed at $275,000, to a four-bedroom, 6,043-square-foot colonial, built in 1998 on 44.18 acres, listed at $2.995 million. The median sales price for a single-family house during the 12-month period ending Sept. 7 was $507,500, up from $439,000 during the previous 12 months.

The 35-acre Pratt Pavilion and Recreational Facility is home to ball fields, tennis and pickleball courts, a dog park, playground and pond; it is across from the well-used senior center. Annual town-sponsored events include a fishing derby, tractor parade and holiday tree-lighting celebration. Last month, residents volunteered at the 67th annual Bridgewater Country Fair, where livestock competitions, tractor pulls, rides and lots of food drew throngs. The fair is the main fund-raiser for the Bridgewater Volunteer Fire Company, the last self-sustaining fire department in Connecticut. Bridgewater does not have a supermarket, medical office or movie theater; those can be found in neighboring New Milford. The commercial hub is the Bridgewater Village Store and Bistro Bridgewater, housed in an 1899 Victorian building. The store sells baked goods, sandwiches, organic produce and Bridgewater Chocolate. The bistro opened in 2016 after the town repealed its dry status, the last Connecticut town to do so. Bridgewater is served by Regional School District 12, which also serves the towns of Washington and Roxbury. The district is small, with just 613 students. Each town has its own elementary school; children from Bridgewater attend the Burnham School for kindergarten through fifth grade. The district converges for grades 6 through 12 at Shepaug Valley School, in Washington. Construction has begun at Shepaug Valley on the new AgSTEM Academy, which will offer classes in agricultural, veterinary and environmental sciences to grades 9 through 12, starting next August. On the district's 2017 fourth-grade Smarter Balanced assessments, 82.9 percent met English standards and 85.4 percent met math standards, compared to 54.1 percent and 50 percent statewide. Mean SAT scores for Shepaug Valley's 2017 graduating class were 559 in evidence-based reading and writing and 547 in math; statewide equivalents were 530 and 512.

Just over 10 miles to Interstate 84, Bridgewater is roughly a half-hour's drive from Danbury and an hour from Hartford and Stamford. Commuters to Manhattan, 80 miles southwest, can drive 25 miles into New York to catch Metro-North Railroad's Harlem line at Southeast or Brewster. Rush-hour trains to and from Grand Central take 75 to 93 minutes; monthly fare is $422. William D. Burnham lived in Bridgewater only until he was 12, but he was so enamored of the place that he bequeathed a hefty sum to the town. Mr. Burnham went to sea at 14 and later became captain of a clipper ship; he earned his fortune as an officer of the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company. He died in 1919, just shy of 72. Within a decade, in accordance with his will, the Greek Revival-style Burnham Library and the Burnham School were built side by side, and the Burnham Fund was established to help the town's low-income residents.

Food,What to Cook This Weekend,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/dining/what-to-cook-this-weekend.html,"Good morning. What's your first pizza memory? Chances are, it's about a pizza you still enjoy, reflexively, whether it was a grandma slice from that joint near the boardwalk, a greasy triangle from a place in Van Nuys or the half tube of a French bread pizza going ding in the toaster oven on your parents' kitchen counter, right after school.

For Anthony Falco, the former oven czar at Roberta's in Brooklyn and now a pizza consultant with clients all over the world, two memories linger, and they were formed simultaneously. There is his Sicilian great-grandmother's pizza, with hardly any cheese. He had that a lot, growing up. And then there is Pizza Hut, which he loved unreservedly.

I wrote about Falco and his quest to develop a home cook's recipe for personal pan pizza in The Times this week. Of course there's a recipe (above) to go along with the words and, if you'd like to improvise a different kind of topping, a recipe for plain pan pizza dough as well. (Try tomato sauce, black olives, provolone and thinly sliced red onion!) Start this evening so the dough has enough time to proof, and then have a pizza party on Sunday night before Game 2 of the NBA Finals, which'll be a doozy.

But don't just cook pizza this weekend. The other day our Kim Severson traveled to Birmingham, Ala., to check in with Dolester Miles, the pastry chef at the Highlands Bar & Grill. Ms. Miles, who has had the job since 1982 and would prefer that you just call her Dol, was recently given the James Beard Award for pastry chef of the year.

Technology,Hacks Raise Fear Over N.S.A.'s Hold on Cyberweapons,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/28/technology/ransomware-nsa-hacking-tools.html,"Twice in the past month, National Security Agency cyberweapons stolen from its arsenal have been turned against two very different partners of the United States -- Britain and Ukraine. The N.S.A. has kept quiet, not acknowledging its role in developing the weapons. White House officials have deflected many questions, and responded to others by arguing that the focus should be on the attackers themselves, not the manufacturer of their weapons. But the silence is wearing thin for victims of the assaults, as a series of escalating attacks using N.S.A. cyberweapons have hit hospitals, a nuclear site and American businesses. Now there is growing concern that United States intelligence agencies have rushed to create digital weapons that they cannot keep safe from adversaries or disable once they fall into the wrong hands. On Wednesday, the calls for the agency to address its role in the latest attacks grew louder, as victims and technology companies cried foul. Representative Ted Lieu, a California Democrat and a former Air Force officer who serves on the House Judiciary and Foreign Affairs Committees, urged the N.S.A. to help stop the attacks and to stop hoarding knowledge of the computer vulnerabilities upon which these weapons rely.

In an email on Wednesday evening, Michael Anton, a spokesman for the National Security Council at the White House, noted that the government ""employs a disciplined, high-level interagency decision-making process for disclosure of known vulnerabilities"" in software, ""unlike any other country in the world."" Mr. Anton said the administration ""is committed to responsibly balancing national security interests and public safety and security,"" but declined to comment ""on the origin of any of the code making up this malware."" Beyond that, the government has blamed others. Two weeks ago, the United States -- through the Department of Homeland Security -- said it had evidence North Korea was responsible for a wave of attacks in May using ransomware called WannaCry that shut down hospitals, rail traffic and production lines. The attacks on Tuesday against targets in Ukraine, which spread worldwide, appeared more likely to be the work of Russian hackers, though no culprit has been formally identified.

Though the identities of the Shadow Brokers remain a mystery, former intelligence officials say there is no question from where the weapons came: a unit deep within the agency that was until recently called ""Tailored Access Operations."" While the government has remained quiet, private industry has not. Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, said outright that the National Security Agency was the source of the ""vulnerabilities"" now wreaking havoc and called on the agency to ""consider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits."" For the American spy agency, which has invested billions of dollars developing an arsenal of weapons that have been used against the Iranian nuclear program, North Korea's missile launches and Islamic State militants, what is unfolding across the world amounts to a digital nightmare. It was as if the Air Force lost some of its most sophisticated missiles and discovered an adversary was launching them against American allies -- yet refused to respond, or even to acknowledge that the missiles were built for American use. Officials fret that the potential damage from the Shadow Brokers leaks could go much further, and the agency's own weaponry could be used to destroy critical infrastructure in allied nations or in the United States. ""Whether it's North Korea, Russia, China, Iran or ISIS, almost all of the flash points out there now involve a cyber element,"" Leon E. Panetta, the former defense secretary and Central Intelligence Agency chief said in a recent interview, before the weapons were turned against American interests. ""I'm not sure we understand the full capability of what can happen, that these sophisticated viruses can suddenly mutate into other areas you didn't intend, more and more,"" Mr. Panetta said. ""That's the threat we're going to face in the near future."" Using the remnants of American weapons is not entirely new. Elements of Stuxnet, the computer worm that disabled the centrifuges used in Iran's nuclear weapons program seven years ago, have been incorporated in some attacks.

And on Tuesday, on the eve of Ukraine's Constitution Day -- which commemorates the country's first constitution after breaking away from the Soviet Union -- attackers used N.S.A.-developed techniques to freeze computers in Ukrainian hospitals, supermarkets, and even the systems for radiation monitoring at the old Chernobyl nuclear plant. The so-called ransomware that gained the most attention in the Ukraine attack is believed to have been a smoke screen for a deeper assault aimed at destroying victims' computers entirely. And while WannaCry had a kill switch that was used to contain it, the attackers hitting Ukraine made sure there was no such mechanism. They also ensured that their code could infect computers that had received software patches intended to protect them. ""You're seeing a refinement of these capabilities, and it only heads in one direction,"" said Robert Silvers, the former assistant secretary of cyber policy at the Department of Homeland Security, now a partner at the law firm Paul Hastings.

The N.S.A. has kept quiet, not acknowledging its role in developing the weapons. White House officials have deflected many questions, and responded to others by arguing that the focus should be on the attackers themselves, not the manufacturer of their weapons. But the silence is wearing thin for victims of the assaults, as a series of escalating attacks using N.S.A. cyberweapons have hit hospitals, a nuclear site and American businesses. Now there is growing concern that United States intelligence agencies have rushed to create digital weapons that they cannot keep safe from adversaries or disable once they fall into the wrong hands. On Wednesday, the calls for the agency to address its role in the latest attacks grew louder, as victims and technology companies cried foul. Representative Ted Lieu, a California Democrat and a former Air Force officer who serves on the House Judiciary and Foreign Affairs Committees, urged the N.S.A. to help stop the attacks and to stop hoarding knowledge of the computer vulnerabilities upon which these weapons rely.

In an email on Wednesday evening, Michael Anton, a spokesman for the National Security Council at the White House, noted that the government ""employs a disciplined, high-level interagency decision-making process for disclosure of known vulnerabilities"" in software, ""unlike any other country in the world."" Mr. Anton said the administration ""is committed to responsibly balancing national security interests and public safety and security,"" but declined to comment ""on the origin of any of the code making up this malware."" Beyond that, the government has blamed others. Two weeks ago, the United States -- through the Department of Homeland Security -- said it had evidence North Korea was responsible for a wave of attacks in May using ransomware called WannaCry that shut down hospitals, rail traffic and production lines. The attacks on Tuesday against targets in Ukraine, which spread worldwide, appeared more likely to be the work of Russian hackers, though no culprit has been formally identified.

Though the identities of the Shadow Brokers remain a mystery, former intelligence officials say there is no question from where the weapons came: a unit deep within the agency that was until recently called ""Tailored Access Operations."" While the government has remained quiet, private industry has not. Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, said outright that the National Security Agency was the source of the ""vulnerabilities"" now wreaking havoc and called on the agency to ""consider the damage to civilians that comes from hoarding these vulnerabilities and the use of these exploits."" For the American spy agency, which has invested billions of dollars developing an arsenal of weapons that have been used against the Iranian nuclear program, North Korea's missile launches and Islamic State militants, what is unfolding across the world amounts to a digital nightmare. It was as if the Air Force lost some of its most sophisticated missiles and discovered an adversary was launching them against American allies -- yet refused to respond, or even to acknowledge that the missiles were built for American use. Officials fret that the potential damage from the Shadow Brokers leaks could go much further, and the agency's own weaponry could be used to destroy critical infrastructure in allied nations or in the United States. ""Whether it's North Korea, Russia, China, Iran or ISIS, almost all of the flash points out there now involve a cyber element,"" Leon E. Panetta, the former defense secretary and Central Intelligence Agency chief said in a recent interview, before the weapons were turned against American interests. ""I'm not sure we understand the full capability of what can happen, that these sophisticated viruses can suddenly mutate into other areas you didn't intend, more and more,"" Mr. Panetta said. ""That's the threat we're going to face in the near future."" Using the remnants of American weapons is not entirely new. Elements of Stuxnet, the computer worm that disabled the centrifuges used in Iran's nuclear weapons program seven years ago, have been incorporated in some attacks.

And on Tuesday, on the eve of Ukraine's Constitution Day -- which commemorates the country's first constitution after breaking away from the Soviet Union -- attackers used N.S.A.-developed techniques to freeze computers in Ukrainian hospitals, supermarkets, and even the systems for radiation monitoring at the old Chernobyl nuclear plant. The so-called ransomware that gained the most attention in the Ukraine attack is believed to have been a smoke screen for a deeper assault aimed at destroying victims' computers entirely. And while WannaCry had a kill switch that was used to contain it, the attackers hitting Ukraine made sure there was no such mechanism. They also ensured that their code could infect computers that had received software patches intended to protect them. ""You're seeing a refinement of these capabilities, and it only heads in one direction,"" said Robert Silvers, the former assistant secretary of cyber policy at the Department of Homeland Security, now a partner at the law firm Paul Hastings.

He documented the swings of more than 400 pro golfers.





Leonard Kamsler, a photojournalist whose award-winning pictures of professional golf for nearly 50 years pushed the envelope of sports strobe photography as he amassed a trove of more than 200,000 images on the PGA Tour, died on Nov. 18 in Bethel, N.Y. He was 85. His husband and only immediate survivor, Stephen Lyles, said the cause was organ failure. Mr. Kamsler had homes in Bethel and Manhattan. Jim Richerson, president of the PGA of America, called Mr. Kamsler ""the undisputed dean of golf photography."" Last month, Mr. Kamsler became the first recipient of the organization's Lifetime Achievement Award in Photojournalism. Practically half of that lifetime was spent on the golf course, though lugging a camera instead of clubs. Beginning in 1963, he covered 40 consecutive Masters tournaments, 17 P.G.A. championships and 22 U.S. Opens, freezing moments of action in indelible images.

""His ability to take the perfect picture at the perfect time was unsurpassed by anyone in the business,"" the champion golfer Tom Watson said in a videotaped tribute when Mr. Kamsler received the lifetime achievement award. Mr. Kamsler's technical innovations in high-speed strobe photography broke down the complete arc of a golf swing from beginning to end in stop-motion exposures -- from address to backswing to contact to follow-through -- each position of the hands, arms, feet, legs, torso, head and club contained in a single sequential image suggestive of a pinwheel. George Peper, his editor at Golf Magazine for 25 of Mr. Kamsler's 60 years associated with the publication, said it was Mr. Kamsler who ""created the swing-sequence in golf without question."" Mr. Kamsler, he said, ""learned at Edgerton's knee,"" referring to Harold Edgerton, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who pioneered stroboscopic technology. Mr. Kamsler began consulting with Mr. Edgerton in 1957.

Mr. Kamsler's primary instrument was a hulking Hulcher high-speed 35-millimeter camera, originally designed to shoot at some 70 frames per second. He was able to push the limit to 100, and then 200, frames per second -- meaning that in less than three seconds of lightning-fast exposures he could dissect an entire golf swing. Mr. Kamsler's first sequential stop-motion study, of Arnold Palmer's technique and clubhead dynamics, ""created a sensation,"" Mr. Peper said, adding that as a teaching tool ""it was posted on every golf instructor's wall in America."" Mr. Kamsler documented more than 400 golf-swing sequences of other champion golfers, including Sam Snead, Jack Nicklaus, Kathy Whitworth and Tiger Woods. During a tournament he could be innovative in capturing the action. One risky technique was to flatten himself on the ground with his camera and have the best golfers in the world hit past his head. During one practice-tee setup, he positioned Mr. Nicklaus so close to him that the golfer's explosive shot just missed destroying Mr. Kamsler's lens. According to the P.G.A., Mr. Kamsler was the first photographer to set up remote-control cameras behind the notoriously challenging holes 12 and 15 at Augusta National Golf Club, where the Masters is played. Some golfers abhorred being photographed up close during competition, so Mr. Kamsler would resort to subterfuge. He once hid himself in a garbage bag to snap the camera-shy Australian Bruce Crampton.

Starting in the 1970s, Mr. Kamsler widened his field to profile performers in Nashville, including Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, Waylon Jennings, Tammy Wynette and Loretta Lynn. Many of his pictures became the covers of record albums. His collection of music images was recently purchased by the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, where many are on view. More than 20 of his photos were shown in ""Country Music,"" the 2019 documentary series by Ken Burns for PBS. Mr. Kamsler's strobe-lighting work also reached beyond golf. He devised one complex strobe system to capture the first attempt at a quintuple somersault by the Flying Cranes aerial troupe of the Moscow Circus. The picture ran in The New York Times Magazine on Dec. 30, 1990, with a cover article about the troupe. A circus aficionado, he also photographed performances of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, the animal trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams and the magicians Siegfried & Roy's stage act using tigers.

Technology,New Google Campus Accelerates Tech's March Into New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/technology/google-new-york-campus.html,"As West Coast companies storm into New York, they are reshaping the city's neighborhoods and changing its identity from a hub of finance, fashion and media to one increasingly centered on technology. Google said on Monday that it planned to create a $1 billion campus just south of the West Village. The internet company's push into one of Manhattan's most famous neighborhoods positions it to become one of New York's biggest occupants of office space, allowing it to double its work force in the city to more than 14,000 over the next decade. Google follows Amazon, which said last month that it planned to open a new office in Queens that will house as many as 25,000 employees. Apple, Facebook, LinkedIn and Uber have also embarked on recent New York expansions -- much of it driven by a hunt for talent. Each is creating hundreds or thousands of high-paying jobs and leasing or building millions of square feet in commercial real estate. ""Law, medicine and finance have been superseded by information technologies,"" said Mitchell Moss, an urban-planning professor at New York University who studies the city's economy.

Google's new campus selection of Hudson Square, once an industrial district just south of the West Village, strengthens its grip on Manhattan's West Side, likely accelerating the neighborhood's changes. That would mirror how Google transformed Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, where it has had an office since 2006. The company bought Chelsea Market for $2.4 billion earlier this year and an adjacent building in 2010, and it leases other space in the area, about a 20-minute walk from its new offices. The centerpiece of the new 1.7-million-square-foot campus will be the St. John's Terminal building near the Holland Tunnel on Washington Street, with Google also set to occupy space at two buildings nearby on Hudson Street. Altogether, the company will expand its footprint in Manhattan by a third to about 6.75 million square feet. ""New York City continues to be a great source of diverse, world-class talent,"" Ruth Porat, Google's chief financial officer, said in a statement on Monday. ""That's what brought Google to the city in 2000, and that's what keeps us here."" [Read our article chronicling Google's slow expansion in New York.] New York's transformation into a tech center began after the 2008 financial crisis, when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg focused on the industry as an engine of future growth. His administration sought to upgrade the tech skills of the local labor force, a campaign that led Cornell University and its partner, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, to open an applied science and engineering campus on Roosevelt Island. Tech initiatives -- new courses, buildings and research institutes -- are also underway at Columbia University, New York University and the City University of New York. Google arrived in New York when it opened an advertising sales office in 2000. It added an engineering team in the city in 2003 and has steadily expanded since.

Other big tech companies quickly followed. Amazon and Facebook each now have more than 2,000 employees in New York, while Apple and Salesforce each employ more than 1,000. LinkedIn has a large office in the Empire State Building, and IBM chose New York as the base for its Watson artificial intelligence and cloud computing divisions. Since 2009, jobs in tech and advertising in New York have increased 31 percent to 360,600, while financial-services jobs in the city increased about 12 percent to 475,500, according to an analysis of federal data by Ken McCarthy, principal economist at the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield. By contrast, the education and health sectors employ about one million people in New York, while the hospitality industry employs 465,800, according to his analysis. Mr. McCarthy said federal data categorized jobs based on the employer, meaning any bank employee is counted as finance. But New York's traditional industries -- banking, retailing and consulting -- have also added thousands of tech jobs. JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup each employ thousands of tech workers, including many in new fields like data science, blockchain and machine learning.

And New York's tech sector is accelerating. Over the past year, the share of New York postings on the job site Indeed increased nearly 13 percent for tech jobs and just 2 percent for finance and accounting jobs. About 5 percent of all New York jobs posted on Indeed are now tech related, the site said, compared with 3 percent for finance and accounting. That growth has made San Francisco, which is a gateway to Silicon Valley, a sort of sister city to New York. As a result, the air route between them is one of the nation's most competitive and heavily trafficked.

Google's expansion in Manhattan contrasts with that of Amazon's in Long Island City, where a plan to enter the formerly industrial Queens neighborhood has been greeted with intense local debate. Amazon executives, who have promised little in the way of neighborhood benefits in exchange for as much as $3 billion in state and city incentives, faced protests and withering questioning at a New York City Council hearing last week. Google has expanded quietly and has not asked for public subsidies.

""We've done it by the dint our own work."" Still, Google has faced criticism in New York. The owners of some Chelsea restaurants said they are losing potential customers because of the company's free-food-at-work policies. (San Francisco officials recently considered banning new employee cafeterias in the city for that reason.) And some in Manhattan are wary that Google and other businesses will begin to spread into historic neighborhoods. ""My concern is that with Google's concentration in that area, it's going to pull in even more intense pressure for office development, particularly tech office development, in adjacent neighborhoods like the Village and East Village, where we are seeing it happen already,"" said Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation. Mr. Berman said he did not oppose Google's expansion in Hudson Square, which in the past decade has transformed into a commercial district, with many of its lofts and factories converted to offices for more than 1,000 companies, many in technology, advertising and media. Today, more than 50,000 people work in the neighborhood, and thousands more have made their home there following a 2013 city rezoning that allowed residential development.

Google said on Monday that it planned to create a $1 billion campus just south of the West Village. The internet company's push into one of Manhattan's most famous neighborhoods positions it to become one of New York's biggest occupants of office space, allowing it to double its work force in the city to more than 14,000 over the next decade. Google follows Amazon, which said last month that it planned to open a new office in Queens that will house as many as 25,000 employees. Apple, Facebook, LinkedIn and Uber have also embarked on recent New York expansions -- much of it driven by a hunt for talent.

""Law, medicine and finance have been superseded by information technologies,"" said Mitchell Moss, an urban-planning professor at New York University who studies the city's economy.

Google's new campus selection of Hudson Square, once an industrial district just south of the West Village, strengthens its grip on Manhattan's West Side, likely accelerating the neighborhood's changes. That would mirror how Google transformed Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, where it has had an office since 2006. The company bought Chelsea Market for $2.4 billion earlier this year and an adjacent building in 2010, and it leases other space in the area, about a 20-minute walk from its new offices. The centerpiece of the new 1.7-million-square-foot campus will be the St. John's Terminal building near the Holland Tunnel on Washington Street, with Google also set to occupy space at two buildings nearby on Hudson Street. Altogether, the company will expand its footprint in Manhattan by a third to about 6.75 million square feet. ""New York City continues to be a great source of diverse, world-class talent,"" Ruth Porat, Google's chief financial officer, said in a statement on Monday. ""That's what brought Google to the city in 2000, and that's what keeps us here."" [Read our article chronicling Google's slow expansion in New York.] New York's transformation into a tech center began after the 2008 financial crisis, when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg focused on the industry as an engine of future growth. His administration sought to upgrade the tech skills of the local labor force, a campaign that led Cornell University and its partner, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, to open an applied science and engineering campus on Roosevelt Island. Tech initiatives -- new courses, buildings and research institutes -- are also underway at Columbia University, New York University and the City University of New York. Google arrived in New York when it opened an advertising sales office in 2000. It added an engineering team in the city in 2003 and has steadily expanded since.

Other big tech companies quickly followed. Amazon and Facebook each now have more than 2,000 employees in New York, while Apple and Salesforce each employ more than 1,000. LinkedIn has a large office in the Empire State Building, and IBM chose New York as the base for its Watson artificial intelligence and cloud computing divisions. Since 2009, jobs in tech and advertising in New York have increased 31 percent to 360,600, while financial-services jobs in the city increased about 12 percent to 475,500, according to an analysis of federal data by Ken McCarthy, principal economist at the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield. By contrast, the education and health sectors employ about one million people in New York, while the hospitality industry employs 465,800, according to his analysis. Mr. McCarthy said federal data categorized jobs based on the employer, meaning any bank employee is counted as finance. But New York's traditional industries -- banking, retailing and consulting -- have also added thousands of tech jobs. JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup each employ thousands of tech workers, including many in new fields like data science, blockchain and machine learning.

And New York's tech sector is accelerating. Over the past year, the share of New York postings on the job site Indeed increased nearly 13 percent for tech jobs and just 2 percent for finance and accounting jobs. About 5 percent of all New York jobs posted on Indeed are now tech related, the site said, compared with 3 percent for finance and accounting. That growth has made San Francisco, which is a gateway to Silicon Valley, a sort of sister city to New York. As a result, the air route between them is one of the nation's most competitive and heavily trafficked. ""There is more economic connectivity between New York and San Francisco than between New York and any of the declining upstate cities,"" Mr. Moss said.

Education,"In Alabama, a Model for Obama's Push to Expand Preschool",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/education/details-emerge-on-obamas-call-to-extend-preschool.html,"President Obama's call in his State of the Union address to ""make high-quality preschool available to every single child in America"" rallied advocates across the country who have long argued that inequity in education begins at a very young age. In details that emerged early Thursday, the administration proposed that the federal government work with states to provide preschool for every 4-year-old from low- and moderate-income families. The president's plan also calls for expanding Early Head Start, the federal program designed to prepare children from low-income families for school, to broaden quality childcare for infants and toddlers. While supporters herald the plans as a way to help level the playing field for children who do not have the advantages of daily bedtime stories, music lessons and counting games at home, critics argue that federal money could be squandered on ineffective programs. In the 2010-11 school year, the latest year for which data is available, 28 percent of all four-year-olds in the United States were enrolled in state-financed preschool programs, according to the National Institute for Early Education Research.

According to W. Steven Barnett, director of the institute, which is based at Rutgers University, only five states, including Oklahoma and Georgia, have a stated objective of offering preschool slots to all 4-year-olds. While about 1.1 million students across the country are enrolled in federally financed Head Start programs and others attend private preschools, that still leaves millions of children on the sidelines. The president's plan would provide federal matching dollars to states to provide public preschool slots for four-years olds whose families earn up to 200 percent of the poverty level. President Obama would also allocate extra funds for states to expand public pre-kindergarten slots for middle-class families, who could pay on a sliding scale of tuition. President Obama's early education proposals come as a handful of states have been more aggressively pushing taxpayer-financed preschool. In Alabama, for example, Gov. Robert Bentley, a Republican, has called for a $12.5 million increase -- or more than 60 percent -- in the state's preschool budget, with the eventual goal of increasing financing over 10 years to the point where every 4-year-old in the state could have a preschool slot. The governor's proposal is supported by a coalition of early-education advocates and business leaders, who see preschool as an important component of future job readiness.

""We're trying to invest in a work force that can compete in 20 years with other states and other nations,"" said Allison de la Torre, executive director of the coalition, the Alabama School Readiness Alliance. Alabama is one of only five states whose preschool program received top marks based on an assessment of its quality standards by the National Institute for Early Education Research, but only 6 percent of 4-year-olds there are enrolled in a state-financed preschool. To receive state money in Alabama, a preschool must employ teachers with bachelor's degrees in early childhood education or child development, keep class sizes under 20 children, and follow a state-approved curriculum. The Obama administration is proposing similar standards for its federal matching program. At one of the state-financed sites on Wednesday, the Nina Nicks Joseph Child Development Center in Mobile, Tina Adair, the lead teacher in a class of 18 students, most of whom come from low-income families, helped Amiyah Wilson, 5, copy the words ""Happy Valentine's Day"" onto a card for her mother. Elsewhere in the classroom, Donovan Smith, 5, and Henry Hinojosa, 5, used a scale to compare the weights of two loads of blocks. Ms. Adair said that the children had plenty of time to paint, sing or play with dress-up clothes and toy trucks. But she said they were also preparing for kindergarten and beyond through letter and number games, science experiments and writing. As a former middle-school teacher, Ms. Adair said she could tell when students have had academic preparation from an early age. ""As fast-paced as our public school system is right now,"" she said, ""any little advantage that they can get is a bonus.""

Advocates for early education frequently cite research on the long-term benefits of preschool, by James J. Heckman at the University of Chicago and others, showing a link to reduced crime rates, lower dropout rates and eventual higher incomes among those who attend preschool. Critics say the federal government has already tested a national preschool program with Head Start. A national study sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services of 5,000 3- and 4-year-olds in 84 local programs found few lasting benefits by third grade. ""It's one thing to say that there are a handful of small pre-K programs that may have had lasting and significant benefits,"" said Andrew J. Coulson, director of the Cato Center for Educational Freedom, a unit of the Cato Institute, a conservative-leaning research organization. ""It's another to imagine that the federal government can scale them up nationally."" But other education analysts say that Head Start, which receives about $7 billion in federal money annually, is hampered by inconsistent standards and low pay for teachers, who are typically paid less than public school educators. ""When I hear people say, 'We've tried to replicate high-quality preschool programs, and it hasn't worked,' I always stop and say, 'We haven't yet tried to replicate high-quality preschool programs, because we haven't yet tried to pay preschool teachers the same that we're paying our K-12 teachers,'"" said Lisa Guernsey, director of early education at the New America Foundation, a nonprofit and nonpartisan policy institute. ""It's pretty hard to imagine that we're going to be recruiting great teachers if we're paying them a poverty-level or just-above-poverty-level wage."" The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Head Start, has started changing the program, including requiring local providers to compete for financing every five years and imposing structured evaluations on classrooms. In a report released last week, the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning research organization, estimated that providing preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds would cost about $98.4 billion in federal spending over 10 years.",President Obama's plan would involve the federal government working with states to help families get access to preschool.,1d2962e7-fe0d-5481-9e0a-d5409ff0f89c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/02/14/us/EARLYED/EARLYED-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=8157bfd93a15bf6e08381d5e931929ba526d7f19ea9036387f56ac2e3b64f950&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Damien Fowler, 4, playing a memory game with his teacher at the Nina Nicks Joseph Child Development Center in Mobile, Ala.",1d2962e7-fe0d-5481-9e0a-d5409ff0f89c,Demo_data/D1_img2/11d2962e7-fe0d-5481-9e0a-d5409ff0f89c.jpg,22,"In Alabama, a Model for Obama's Push to Expand Preschool President Obama's call in his State of the Union address to ""make high-quality preschool available to every single child in America"" rallied advocates across the country who have long argued that inequity in education begins at a very young age.

Heckman at the University of Chicago and others, showing a link to reduced crime rates, lower dropout rates and eventual higher incomes among those who attend preschool. Critics say the federal government has already tested a national preschool program with Head Start. A national study sponsored by the Department of Health and Human Services of 5,000 3- and 4-year-olds in 84 local programs found few lasting benefits by third grade. ""It's one thing to say that there are a handful of small pre-K programs that may have had lasting and significant benefits,"" said Andrew J. Coulson, director of the Cato Center for Educational Freedom, a unit of the Cato Institute, a conservative-leaning research organization. ""It's another to imagine that the federal government can scale them up nationally."" But other education analysts say that Head Start, which receives about $7 billion in federal money annually, is hampered by inconsistent standards and low pay for teachers, who are typically paid less than public school educators. ""When I hear people say, 'We've tried to replicate high-quality preschool programs, and it hasn't worked,' I always stop and say, 'We haven't yet tried to replicate high-quality preschool programs, because we haven't yet tried to pay preschool teachers the same that we're paying our K-12 teachers,'"" said Lisa Guernsey, director of early education at the New America Foundation, a nonprofit and nonpartisan policy institute. ""It's pretty hard to imagine that we're going to be recruiting great teachers if we're paying them a poverty-level or just-above-poverty-level wage."" The Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Head Start, has started changing the program, including requiring local providers to compete for financing every five years and imposing structured evaluations on classrooms. In a report released last week, the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning research organization, estimated that providing preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds would cost about $98.4 billion in federal spending over 10 years. President Obama's plan would involve the federal government working with states to help families get access to preschool.",22,['22'],22
Economy,Making Medicaid a Tool for Moral Education May Let Some Die,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/business/economy/work-medicaid.html,"Apparently the plan to Make America Great Again will let some Americans die. Kentucky rushed last week to become the first of the nation's 50 states to impose a work requirement on recipients of Medicaid. Under the state's HEALTH plan, most able-bodied 19-to-64-year-olds -- excluding the pregnant, the medically frail and some others -- will have to work, get job training or perform community service for at least 20 hours a week to qualify for coverage, starting in July. They will have to pay for it, too -- a premium starting at $1 per month for families living on up to one-quarter of the federal poverty line, or about $400 a month for a family of three (such families exist, apparently) and rising to $15 for those who manage to stay above the poverty threshold. The initiative is, of course, not about saving the state money by pushing poor people off the insurance rolls. It is providing moral education. In the words of Gov. Matt Bevin, the HEALTH plan will free Kentuckians from the ""dead-end entitlement trap"" and give them ""a path forward and upward"" so they can fend for themselves. But the fact remains that the plan is expected to reduce Medicaid spending by $2.4 billion over five years. Roughly half of the 350,000 able-bodied Medicaid beneficiaries in Kentucky currently do not meet the work requirements, by the government's estimates, and could lose their benefits. Five years from now, the Bevin administration calculates, the change will have culled some 100,000 people from the rolls.

Kentucky won't be the last. Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin have already submitted their own similar proposals. Barring legal challenges, the Trump administration is eager to let them do it. Millions of Americans stand at risk of losing their health care. Many -- the most fragile, the least great -- could die as a result. Mr. Bevin might care to glance south over the border. In 2005, Tennessee removed 170,000 people -- almost one in 10 Medicaid beneficiaries in the state, mainly working-age adults without children -- from its Medicaid program to save money. They didn't do well. The cuts didn't just eat into poor Tennesseans' finances. One study found that childless adults in Tennessee -- especially the least educated -- started delaying or forgoing visits to the doctor. They reported suffering more days in bad health and incapacitated. And they recorded more visits to hospital emergency rooms, which are required by law to care for all comers, regardless of their ability to pay. Delayed care can kill. Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death among women. One of eight American women will get it. Detecting it early is critical. Specifically, the five-year relative survival rate for localized breast cancer is 98.5 percent when detected early, but only 25 percent when detected at a distant stage. Waiting for 60 days or longer to get treatment raises the risk of dying of breast cancer over five years by 85 percent.

""We are ready to show America how this can and will be done,"" Mr. Bevin said at a news conference in Frankfort. And yet Kentucky's approach to Medicaid draws from a well-worn playbook, one from which both Republicans and Democrats have drawn to trim the social safety net over the years.

Work requirements became the norm. And people got less help. The number of families in poverty in Kentucky has budged little since then, declining to 116,000 from 132,000. But the number of families getting cash assistance has fallen by two-thirds. Today, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program covers only one of five poor families in the state.

Music,Virus Pushes the Bang on a Can Marathon Online,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/arts/music/bang-on-a-can-marathon-coronavirus.html,"It was already going to be a year of transformation for the beloved Bang on a Can Marathon. A New York new-music institution since 1987, the annual event was set to expand into a new three-day festival, Long Play, spread over several Brooklyn performance spaces. Then came the coronavirus pandemic. With Long Play canceled, the Bang on a Can collective's founders and leaders -- the composers David Lang, Michael Gordon and Julia Wolfe -- opted to try another first, if in a more familiar format: a six-hour livestreamed marathon, starting at 3 p.m. Eastern on Sunday, at marathon2020.bangonacan.org. Jazz figures like Vijay Iyer and Mary Halvorson will share a digital space with experimental-music veterans like Meredith Monk and George Lewis. Younger composers have had new pieces commissioned. The production values will be unpolished, but the marathon -- which has varied in venue and length over the years -- has never been too fancy. The emphasis on Sunday aims to be, as it always has been, on free-spirited variety, representation across musical generations and the intermingling of genres and artistic scenes.

How long did it take to reset the plans for this year? DAVID LANG It took us a while to reorient ourselves. We had this gigantic idea of how to expand the marathon into Long Play. I'm sure we'll do that again, should the world ever get back to normal. But we have these people who depend on us, who have no money. We have young people who are looking for opportunities. There are so many people who are in need of a venue. JULIA WOLFE It really came after a lot of discussion and soul-searching about what is important. Everyone's getting compensated. We talked about a lot of different approaches -- and came back to what we do. We started with a marathon in 1987. Over the years we've had so many amazing soloists; the Bang on a Can All-Stars [the collective's resident ensemble] is made up of people who appeared as soloists. So we're very oriented toward spectacular individual players. MICHAEL GORDON Part of the reason it takes so long to get a physical festival together is that everyone has to come to New York. And everyone has a different fee, and different requirements. You know, the classic thing: ""organic cherry tomatoes in my dressing room."" Less than a month ago, we were like: ""OK, we're going to do this."" And then all of a sudden you also realize no one's traveling. There's no conflicts. It's lightning speed, putting this together. There are a lot of distinct musical personalities on the schedule.

WOLFE Meredith kicking it off is very significant. First of all, we just made a beautiful recording with her, so we're really proud of that. And she has a long history with the organization. It was a curatorial decision, from early on, that this is multigenerational; it's multigenre. It's about the power of the music and the performers that engaged us.

What are you particularly looking forward to hearing on Sunday? WOLFE I'm particularly excited about the commissions. Dai Wei is writing a new piece for Todd Reynolds -- for his electronics, and for his incredible violin chops. LANG I have a category of highlights: the people who are pushing the boundaries of the worlds that they are in. I'm interested in people like Moor Mother. I'm interested in Ian Chang. Meara O'Reilly.

I thought, ""Oh, what's this going to be, a flop?"" And then he did the most incredible trombone solo. I was totally floored. And now here we are, a little more than 30 years later. To get to hear him, it's special. You come full circle.

There are also lots of artists on the schedule who are closer to the beginning of their careers, like Shelley Washington.

We have some great video shots of her, from a Bang on a Can summer festival, looking ecstatic. We stayed in touch. It's fun again to pair her with the Bang on a Can All-Star clarinetist Ken Thomson, because they worked so well together at the summer institute. LANG Eight of the younger composers -- I wouldn't call them ""young"" any more -- were people who came through our summer institute. When we started the marathon, we were trying to figure out people for whom Bang on a Can is central. Shelley Washington is a great example. She's an amazing person who would have been fine without us. But she found us. So we want to make sure we can help her, in this moment. The beloved New York musical event was set to expand this year, but will instead be livestreamed on Sunday.",12,['12'],12
Your Money,Pandemic Has Increased Money Anxiety. Therapists Hope to Cure That.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/your-money/coronavirus-money-fears-financial-therapy.html,"Dale Mackey closed her event space in Knoxville, Tenn., a week before the state issued its orders to end large gatherings. She did not think about the economic ramifications of shuttering her business, the Central Collective; she said it was the right thing to do to reduce the spread of the virus. Work dried up for her husband, Shawn Poynter, a photographer, so to help make ends meet, Ms. Mackey began spending more time on a side business, making sweet and savory pies and selling them online. She and her husband are in their mid-30s and have some savings and no debt beyond mortgages on their home and the event space, so they were content hunkering down. But as the weeks wore on, thoughts of financial anxiety began to emerge. ""It's much more of a struggle for me about when we can reopen,"" Ms. Mackey said, adding that the uncertainty began to weigh on her. ""It's different if I knew we were going to be opening in three months."" In this financial crisis, many Americans are facing increased stress about money. But Ms. Mackey turned to a solution that few people try: She sought a financial therapist, a professional trained to counsel people about their money woes. Most have advanced degrees in psychology or clinical social work.

Ms. Mackey found Amanda Clayman, a financial therapist in Los Angeles who has a podcast on financial therapy within WNYC's Death, Sex and Money franchise. ""When you bring up the topic of financial therapy, people are like, 'That's me, I want help,' or their level of defensiveness is so intense,"" said Ms. Clayman, who puts people on the proverbial couch for her podcast, ""Financial Therapy With Amanda Clayman,"" which was introduced this week. The pandemic is an ideal time to lay bare people's psychological struggles around money, she said, because the financial fallout from closing the U.S. economy for months is far from certain. Add to that the guesswork around how lockdown orders may have changed consumer spending habits. ""This pandemic is like a black light,"" Ms. Clayman said. ""It's suddenly revealing all the things that were present before but unseen.""

A few years into the recovery, Kansas State University, which runs a leading undergraduate program for financial planning, started a financial therapy clinic to study people's emotions around money. With electrodes attached to their bodies, participants had their responses measured during a series of financial discussions. (When I participated in 2012, the results showed that I was far more anxious talking even generally about my financial situations than I thought.) Despite the interest, the field of financial therapy remains nascent. Besides Kansas State, Creighton University in Omaha has a financial therapy program. But none of the major financial services firms have anything approaching full-scale financial therapy for the majority of their customers. The nature of such therapy is beyond the training of most financial advisers. It's also an area fraught with risk for an industry that is paid on the advice it gives for the assets it manages. But now is the time to engage, because Americans are going to emerge from the coronavirus recession emotionally scarred in a way similar to the military veterans who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, said Brad Klontz, a financial psychologist in Boulder, Colo., and a pioneer in the field of financial therapy. ""We're experiencing a mass trauma across the United States, if not the world,"" Dr. Klontz said. ""Our illusion that we're safe has been shattered. It's like a psychological earthquake."" He is optimistic, though, that people can use this experience to think more deeply about their financial values. ""It's been a forced wake-up call for everyone in the world,"" he said. ""We have just been offered a crisis to give us an opportunity to think about money."" At home in Knoxville, Ms. Mackey said she was coming to terms with the loss of security she had gained in the past two years. ""I was in my groove, and I was pretty content,"" she said. ""I was working a reasonable amount, earning a reasonable amount, able to take some time off of work here and there.""

Now. she said. she is worried about finances as Tennessee gradually reopens. By next month, when event spaces are allowed to be open at 50 percent capacity, her venue could be up and running, a prospect that would be good financially for her, though she's wrestling with it because of safety issues. ""It's going to be dicey if you can be open, but we don't think it's safe to do so,"" Ms. Mackey said. ""That's when it gets complicated. You have all these contracts to fulfill."" She found her financial therapy session helpful because it allowed her and her husband to talk openly about their financial anxieties. ""I didn't realize I have an emotional relationship to money until we started talking and I realized I'm scared or uncomfortable about it,"" she said. As in most therapy, there was no clear-cut resolution, but the exercise itself was beneficial. ""It's the uncertainty piece that is much harder for me,"" Ms. Mackey said. ""It's harder to plan when you can't say, 'OK, I know this business will be closed for three months or one year.'"" Another guest on the podcast, who requested anonymity for privacy concerns, said the economic crisis had shaken his faith in his ability to provide for his family. It also called into question seemingly rational decisions he had made when he quit his job and started a marketing consultancy in a different city. The business was doing well until the economy shut down. ""The control of money for me is really foundational for who I am,"" the guest said in an interview afterward. ""Now, I'm not in control, and I cannot be in control. I had to swallow it a few times before I could say that out loud."" He said he realized through the therapy session that he could be emotionally distant when talking about money. That realization has lifted some of the burden around earning money.

This crisis is an opportunity for people to allow themselves to be angry that forces beyond their control have disrupted plans they thought they had made wisely, Ms. Clayman said. ""Sometimes, we just need to be angry and settle down and say, 'This is why I made these choices,'"" she said. ""It's our opportunity to come back to some of the emotional or psychological baggage we were carrying and re-choose some of the choices we make."" The concern that financial therapists have now is that people will get stuck in what is known as catastrophic thinking. ""Listen for those thoughts that come up in our head that say things like it's pointless to invest your heart and soul in something because it can just be taken away,"" Ms. Clayman said. ""Or the thought that says, 'This is all on my shoulders, and I can't depend on anybody.'"" She said people should allow themselves to get angry but then begin to address the underlying feelings they have with money that anger often masks. Planning for the worst-case scenario allows most people to understand that they will survive, Dr. Klontz said. Those who have been financially traumatized, particularly children and young adults whose education has been disrupted, could get stuck in a fear-based mentality, akin to what many in the Great Depression generation carried with them. Now is when the stories we tell ourselves become critical. ""Money is a concrete thing that we use for practical purposes, but we cannot separate the concrete part from the meaning point,"" Ms. Clayman said. ""That's not a choice we can make. We can avoid it, but that doesn't make it go away."" After all, she said, ""we're human beings, and our brains are set up to understand the world in stories.""

Your Money,The Choices That Led Small Business Owners to Wealth,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/your-money/the-choices-that-led-small-business-owners-to-wealth.html,"""I've never made a bad decision,"" said William Greenblatt, chairman of SterlingBackcheck, which does employment screening. ""I've just had bad results."" That confidence enabled Mr. Greenblatt, 58, to take the company, which he founded to administer lie-detector tests in 1975, when he was still a college student looking for extra money, to a global business with 3,900 employees. ""We're going to do $500 million in revenue this year,"" he said. ""That's a lot of work when you're doing things at $8, $10, $12 a pop. It's an enormous operation."" Small-business owners are generally focused on the day to day, if not the minute by minute, to keep their enterprises moving forward.

But they still have to make decisions to professionalize the business, put systems in place and have a plan that allows them to do longer-term planning. Those decisions can make the difference between being a small-business owner and a business executive with significant wealth. Of course, which of those decisions matter most is generally clear only in hindsight. ""There is no bright-line test when a company gets to a certain size or age to do these things,"" said Kevin M. Harris, head of the family business group at Northern Trust. ""It is based on where the company wants to go."" Determining which decisions were the ones that made the difference is sometimes not an easy task, and the stories that are retold are often the ones that turned out well. Yet it is worth considering what can go wrong. Entrepreneurs who failed to find success were often resistant to change, said David Reimer, chief executive of Merryck & Company, which uses former chief executives as coaches. ""The reason tends to boil down to self-awareness,"" he said. ""A lot of C.E.O.s and entrepreneurs develop a Teflon coating in order to cope. That's not a bad thing. The bad thing is when there is no longer a distinction between your Teflon coating and who you are, and you can't take on any other input.""

So from the vantage point of hindsight, what were crucial decisions for a selection of business people whose wealth was tied to the businesses they started or inherited? The decisions were generally of an operational nature, rather than part of a great innovation, these business owners said: a way of propelling their company forward and their net worth up. Boot-strapping, the term given to starting a business with an idea, passion and little else, is as much a necessity as a badge of honor for many entrepreneurs. And part of that do-everything ethos is a desire to run the business cheaply, with an awareness that lack of cash has killed many small businesses. Fourteen years ago, when Tom Bernthal got the idea for a market research firm that is today Kelton Global, he and his partner, Gareth Schweitzer, expected to crisscross the country from their base in Los Angeles. ""All of a sudden we realized what we had as a business was our people, and it was all we had to sell,"" Mr. Bernthal said. ""So we went out there and started being willing to pay for this really top-notch talent."" The firm now has 70 employees, he said. In addition to increasing the founders' overhead, that decision in 2010 to make those hires freed Mr. Bernthal, 42, and Mr. Schweitzer to focus on the higher-level projects that would expand the business. ""If you don't hire those types of people, the client always wants you,"" he said, joking that this insight came after his 14th overnight flight for a meeting in three months. For Mr. Greenblatt, the growth of his background-checking company had been steady but slow. He credited the company's faster growth to hiring a president in 1999 to help him expand. To afford it, he was prepared to halve his own pay.

""I never had to take that cut because he was so good,"" he said. ""That's when I realized every single person you hire has to be amazing."" But such leaps can be daunting because they lock the entrepreneur into a higher payroll, which in many new economy businesses is the largest cost. Charles R. Barrett, president and managing direct of FZ Media Design, a digital marketing company outside Philadelphia, said he faced such a prospect in 2009. He had been doing projects for various small companies and relying mostly on freelance designers when extra work came in. But after doing a small job for CareerBuilder.com, he was given the opportunity to do a lot more work for the jobs site. ""It was that first 'put up or shut up' moment,"" he said. ""I just saw tremendous opportunity there. The door was open. How could I kick this door down? I needed bodies."" He took the chance and began building a full-time team, which is now eight people. It paid off. More and more jobs came in from CareerBuilder.com, including the recent introduction of the worldwide jobs portal for Hilton Hotels. He has also been able to step back and focus on the larger strategy. ""I'm really proud of the life it's afforded me,"" Mr. Barrett, 48, said. ""We have a nice house that I've rebuilt and a beach house in New Jersey that my wife loves. I bought a new Mustang and a 1967 Mustang coupe that I've completely rebuilt. You carry the stress load of everything, but it also gives you the freedom to reap the reward."" Mike Cagney, 45, a co-founder of Social Finance Inc., also known as SoF, an online lender focused on student loan refinancing, personal loans and mortgages, said he wanted to make the company's customer service the best it could be.

When he looked into setting up a call center in Sonoma County, Calif., an hour north of San Francisco, the going wage for such work was $12 an hour. ""I looked at that and said there is no way I can pay $12 an hour,"" he said. ""No one can live on $12 an hour."" He considered the decision an investment. ""You can't have the front line of your business talking to your members worrying about making rent that month,"" he said. ""I said we needed to pay people a living wage. I committed to paying $20 an hour, and some members of my board said, 'Why are you doing this?' "" The result has been low turnover rates for workers and high satisfaction scores from customers. The company, which started four years ago with $80 million in financing, recently raised $1 billion and is now valued at $4 billion. It has been profitable for two years. Larry Perkins, 38, applied three times for a job at Alvarez & Marsal, a top corporate restructuring firm, before he was hired in its Los Angeles office in 2006. ""That was a huge achievement in my life to get the job there,"" he said. But 15 days into his dream job, he said, ""I was on a jog and I said, 'What am I doing here?' "" It wasn't the restructuring business, which he loved, that bothered him, but the job itself. So in 2007, at 29, he decided to start his own firm. Three years later, his company was bought by another restructuring firm. A year into that arrangement, he was miserable all over again. ""I got into a position that is not my favorite one,"" he said. ""I was working for someone, trying to do all the right things, but at the end of it I didn't feel like I was building the thing I wanted to build.""

So with five core members, he bought the firm back, a long, messy process that cost him most of the money he made on the initial sale. Since becoming independent again in 2013, the firm has grown to 20 people and business has increased sixfold, he said. ""The challenges I had as a small firm were the same problems I had at a big firm,"" he said. ""A big chunk of the problem I was having was with the guy in the mirror."" Mr. Cagney said he had a similar revelation about his leadership skills. In his first venture, a wealth management technology firm he started in 2000, he thought he was a great chief executive. ""No one left the company, which I took as an endorsement of my management style,"" he said. ""I didn't realize there weren't any other jobs out there. Then my board sat me down and said, 'You're the worst C.E.O. ever.' "" To his credit, he listened and came to agree with the board. So when he started SoFi, he brought in a former colleague 10 years his senior to handle management and other technical roles. ""It was a great thing to do because I wouldn't have to worry about that stuff,"" he said. ""I could worry about other parts of the business."" No account of wealth accumulation can ignore tales of risk-taking. But these entrepreneurs who built wealth did what could be called responsible risk-taking. For Paul Darley, 53, it was a mathematical problem: The business could not support the people in the next generation of his family if they joined the company at the same rate as his generation. So after nearly 100 years of focusing on the firefighting business, he decided that W.S. Darley & Company should expand into military contracting.

""The driver was making the company big enough to support the next generation,"" he said. ""I didn't know anything about the defense business when we went into it, so we had to surround ourselves with good people."" It worked, though not without fits and starts. But he said he listened to advisers and was willing to modify his strategy. Blaine Vess, who 16 years ago founded StudyMode, a college note-sharing site, in his dorm room, ran it as a hobby business until 2005, he said. Then, five years after starting the company, he switched it from an advertising model to a subscription model. He was worried that it would lose customers, but almost at once its revenue spiked, going from $60,000 a year in 2004 to more than $1 million a year in 2007, with just Mr. Vess and his co-founder involved. A third partner they took on in 2008 pushed them to expand internationally. Last year, they hired a chief operating officer. ""We could have kept running this thing the way we were running it even a year ago and get it to higher levels by asking more questions,"" Mr. Vess, 34, said. ""But getting someone in who's been through it before and getting comfortable that this person is doing an awesome job and better than I could do, this has been great."" For those risks, the company has pushed its annual revenue to more than $20 million today.",Executives who have expanded their enterprises share the critical decisions they made that resulted in increased revenue and greater personal wealth.,bab9393d-b873-5925-a6b0-0133888ccea3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/14/your-money/14CONTROL/14CONTROL-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=1814208950688031291e0cac71aa6250f81fc03f42e73ce6373f3977a3ce06df&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Tom Bernthal, a co-founder of Kelton Global, a market research firm, said he came to realize that he had to be willing to pay enough to attract top talent.",bab9393d-b873-5925-a6b0-0133888ccea3,Demo_data/D1_img2/1bab9393d-b873-5925-a6b0-0133888ccea3.jpg,21,"The Choices That Led Small Business Owners to Wealth ""I've never made a bad decision,"" said William Greenblatt, chairman of SterlingBackcheck, which does employment screening. ""I've just had bad results."" That confidence enabled Mr. Greenblatt, 58, to take the company, which he founded to administer lie-detector tests in 1975, when he was still a college student looking for extra money, to a global business with 3,900 employees. ""We're going to do $500 million in revenue this year,"" he said. ""That's a lot of work when you're doing things at $8, $10, $12 a pop. It's an enormous operation."" Small-business owners are generally focused on the day to day, if not the minute by minute, to keep their enterprises moving forward.

But they still have to make decisions to professionalize the business, put systems in place and have a plan that allows them to do longer-term planning. Those decisions can make the difference between being a small-business owner and a business executive with significant wealth. Of course, which of those decisions matter most is generally clear only in hindsight. ""There is no bright-line test when a company gets to a certain size or age to do these things,"" said Kevin M. Harris, head of the family business group at Northern Trust. ""It is based on where the company wants to go."" Determining which decisions were the ones that made the difference is sometimes not an easy task, and the stories that are retold are often the ones that turned out well. Yet it is worth considering what can go wrong. Entrepreneurs who failed to find success were often resistant to change, said David Reimer, chief executive of Merryck & Company, which uses former chief executives as coaches. ""The reason tends to boil down to self-awareness,"" he said. ""A lot of C.E.O.s and entrepreneurs develop a Teflon coating in order to cope. That's not a bad thing. The bad thing is when there is no longer a distinction between your Teflon coating and who you are, and you can't take on any other input.""

So from the vantage point of hindsight, what were crucial decisions for a selection of business people whose wealth was tied to the businesses they started or inherited? The decisions were generally of an operational nature, rather than part of a great innovation, these business owners said: a way of propelling their company forward and their net worth up. Boot-strapping, the term given to starting a business with an idea, passion and little else, is as much a necessity as a badge of honor for many entrepreneurs. And part of that do-everything ethos is a desire to run the business cheaply, with an awareness that lack of cash has killed many small businesses. Fourteen years ago, when Tom Bernthal got the idea for a market research firm that is today Kelton Global, he and his partner, Gareth Schweitzer, expected to crisscross the country from their base in Los Angeles. ""All of a sudden we realized what we had as a business was our people, and it was all we had to sell,"" Mr. Bernthal said. ""So we went out there and started being willing to pay for this really top-notch talent."" The firm now has 70 employees, he said. In addition to increasing the founders' overhead, that decision in 2010 to make those hires freed Mr. Bernthal, 42, and Mr. Schweitzer to focus on the higher-level projects that would expand the business. ""If you don't hire those types of people, the client always wants you,"" he said, joking that this insight came after his 14th overnight flight for a meeting in three months. For Mr. Greenblatt, the growth of his background-checking company had been steady but slow. He credited the company's faster growth to hiring a president in 1999 to help him expand. To afford it, he was prepared to halve his own pay.

""I never had to take that cut because he was so good,"" he said. ""That's when I realized every single person you hire has to be amazing."" But such leaps can be daunting because they lock the entrepreneur into a higher payroll, which in many new economy businesses is the largest cost. Charles R. Barrett, president and managing direct of FZ Media Design, a digital marketing company outside Philadelphia, said he faced such a prospect in 2009. He had been doing projects for various small companies and relying mostly on freelance designers when extra work came in. But after doing a small job for CareerBuilder.com, he was given the opportunity to do a lot more work for the jobs site. ""It was that first 'put up or shut up' moment,"" he said. ""I just saw tremendous opportunity there. The door was open. How could I kick this door down? I needed bodies."" He took the chance and began building a full-time team, which is now eight people. It paid off. More and more jobs came in from CareerBuilder.com, including the recent introduction of the worldwide jobs portal for Hilton Hotels. He has also been able to step back and focus on the larger strategy. ""I'm really proud of the life it's afforded me,"" Mr. Barrett, 48, said. ""We have a nice house that I've rebuilt and a beach house in New Jersey that my wife loves. I bought a new Mustang and a 1967 Mustang coupe that I've completely rebuilt. You carry the stress load of everything, but it also gives you the freedom to reap the reward."" Mike Cagney, 45, a co-founder of Social Finance Inc., also known as SoF, an online lender focused on student loan refinancing, personal loans and mortgages, said he wanted to make the company's customer service the best it could be.

When he looked into setting up a call center in Sonoma County, Calif., an hour north of San Francisco, the going wage for such work was $12 an hour. ""I looked at that and said there is no way I can pay $12 an hour,"" he said. ""No one can live on $12 an hour."" He considered the decision an investment. ""You can't have the front line of your business talking to your members worrying about making rent that month,"" he said. ""I said we needed to pay people a living wage. I committed to paying $20 an hour, and some members of my board said, 'Why are you doing this?' "" The result has been low turnover rates for workers and high satisfaction scores from customers. The company, which started four years ago with $80 million in financing, recently raised $1 billion and is now valued at $4 billion. It has been profitable for two years. Larry Perkins, 38, applied three times for a job at Alvarez & Marsal, a top corporate restructuring firm, before he was hired in its Los Angeles office in 2006. ""That was a huge achievement in my life to get the job there,"" he said. But 15 days into his dream job, he said, ""I was on a jog and I said, 'What am I doing here?' "" It wasn't the restructuring business, which he loved, that bothered him, but the job itself. So in 2007, at 29, he decided to start his own firm. Three years later, his company was bought by another restructuring firm. A year into that arrangement, he was miserable all over again. ""I got into a position that is not my favorite one,"" he said. ""I was working for someone, trying to do all the right things, but at the end of it I didn't feel like I was building the thing I wanted to build.""

So with five core members, he bought the firm back, a long, messy process that cost him most of the money he made on the initial sale. Since becoming independent again in 2013, the firm has grown to 20 people and business has increased sixfold, he said. ""The challenges I had as a small firm were the same problems I had at a big firm,"" he said. ""A big chunk of the problem I was having was with the guy in the mirror."" Mr. Cagney said he had a similar revelation about his leadership skills. In his first venture, a wealth management technology firm he started in 2000, he thought he was a great chief executive. ""No one left the company, which I took as an endorsement of my management style,"" he said. ""I didn't realize there weren't any other jobs out there. Then my board sat me down and said, 'You're the worst C.E.O. ever.' "" To his credit, he listened and came to agree with the board. So when he started SoFi, he brought in a former colleague 10 years his senior to handle management and other technical roles. ""It was a great thing to do because I wouldn't have to worry about that stuff,"" he said. ""I could worry about other parts of the business.""

Real Estate,A New Tower Designed to Blend Into Yorkville,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/realestate/a-new-tower-designed-to-blend-into-yorkville.html,"When Mitchell C. Hochberg, the president of the real estate company Lightstone, needed an architect to design a new tower just a few blocks away from his home in the Yorkville neighborhood of Manhattan, he didn't have to look far. The decorated architect Deborah Berke, dean of the Yale School of Architecture, lives in the building next door. Of course, while living close to one's architect is convenient, it wasn't the primary reason he selected her firm, Deborah Berke Partners, to design Lightstone's new 29-unit condominium at 40 East End Avenue. Rather, he was impressed with Ms. Berke's tastefully simple work and ability to bridge old and new. ""She has an unbelievable aesthetic in terms of blending traditional with modern sophistication,"" said Mr. Hochberg. ""I don't think many designers are able to do that.""

He also assumed that Ms. Berke would share his desire to realize a building that played nice with the area's prewar and midcentury neighbors. ""The idea was to build something that is a modern interpretation of the local and historic architecture that we have,"" he said. Not, he added, ""a flying saucer.""

Ms. Berke was on board (with Gerner Kronick + Valcarcel, Architects serving as the architect of record). Her vision was to design a building that catered to ""contemporary lifestyles and contemporary families -- life in New York in the 21st century,"" she said, ""but that also feels a part of the neighborhood."" Knowing that her neighbors would be scrutinizing the design, Ms. Berke and her colleagues were particularly eager to impress. ""There was a lot of anxiety at the beginning of the project,"" said Stephen Brockman, a senior principal at Deborah Berke Partners. ""Like, 'We better make this good!' ""

The result is a 19-story masonry building with a mix of light gray and charcoal bricks, and ribbed cast stone details separating large casement windows, many of which open wide to glass Juliet balconies. At street level, there is a porte-cochere with white marble walls. Near the top, where the building steps back from the street, the cladding changes to cast stone, and a number of units have private terraces with gardens designed by Gunn Landscape Architecture. Inside, Deborah Berke Partners designed an intimately scaled lobby that connects to a double-height parlor with a subtly Art Deco appearance, including a chevron-patterned floor of black and white marble, and a curled bronze-and-marble staircase. The staircase leads to amenity spaces on the second floor, which include a library, game room, catering kitchen and fitness center. The finishes in individual apartments are upscale yet deliberately simple, with white oak herringbone-patterned floors, white lacquer Pedini kitchen cabinets with woven metal inserts and beveled metal trim, and white Arabescato Cervaiole marble in the kitchens and master bathrooms. ""There's a framework that allows people to apply their own aesthetic,"" said Mr. Brockman. Some rooms also have streamlined plaster crown molding, he noted, with an appearance that is ""more Deco than classical."" Yorkville may not have the same urban buzz as popular downtown neighborhoods like NoHo and SoHo, but James Lansill, a senior managing director at Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which is handling sales and marketing for the building, said that is actually one of the area's biggest attractions.

""It's an oasis of sorts in the urban context,"" he said. ""It's remarkably quiet and filled with tree-lined streets and parks. You can hear birds chirping, and your kids can ride a bike on the sidewalk without fear of too many buses and cars.""

""The idea was to build something that is a modern interpretation of the local and historic architecture that we have,"" he said. Not, he added, ""a flying saucer.""

Ms. Berke was on board (with Gerner Kronick + Valcarcel, Architects serving as the architect of record). Her vision was to design a building that catered to ""contemporary lifestyles and contemporary families -- life in New York in the 21st century,"" she said, ""but that also feels a part of the neighborhood."" Knowing that her neighbors would be scrutinizing the design, Ms. Berke and her colleagues were particularly eager to impress. ""There was a lot of anxiety at the beginning of the project,"" said Stephen Brockman, a senior principal at Deborah Berke Partners. ""Like, 'We better make this good!' ""

The result is a 19-story masonry building with a mix of light gray and charcoal bricks, and ribbed cast stone details separating large casement windows, many of which open wide to glass Juliet balconies. At street level, there is a porte-cochere with white marble walls. Near the top, where the building steps back from the street, the cladding changes to cast stone, and a number of units have private terraces with gardens designed by Gunn Landscape Architecture. Inside, Deborah Berke Partners designed an intimately scaled lobby that connects to a double-height parlor with a subtly Art Deco appearance, including a chevron-patterned floor of black and white marble, and a curled bronze-and-marble staircase. The staircase leads to amenity spaces on the second floor, which include a library, game room, catering kitchen and fitness center. The finishes in individual apartments are upscale yet deliberately simple, with white oak herringbone-patterned floors, white lacquer Pedini kitchen cabinets with woven metal inserts and beveled metal trim, and white Arabescato Cervaiole marble in the kitchens and master bathrooms. ""There's a framework that allows people to apply their own aesthetic,"" said Mr. Brockman. Some rooms also have streamlined plaster crown molding, he noted, with an appearance that is ""more Deco than classical."" Yorkville may not have the same urban buzz as popular downtown neighborhoods like NoHo and SoHo, but James Lansill, a senior managing director at Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which is handling sales and marketing for the building, said that is actually one of the area's biggest attractions.

""It's an oasis of sorts in the urban context,"" he said. ""It's remarkably quiet and filled with tree-lined streets and parks. You can hear birds chirping, and your kids can ride a bike on the sidewalk without fear of too many buses and cars."" He expects the building will receive a lot of interest from people who already live in the neighborhood and, he said, ""want to upgrade to a building with more amenities and services, modern building systems and higher end finishes."" Deborah Berke, dean of the Yale School of Architecture, has designed a 19-story condo that fits with Yorkville's local architecture.",7,['7'],7
Opinion,Carlota's World: What Children Can Teach Us During the Coronavirus Crisis,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-carlota-children-ramos.html,"MIAMI -- The door of Carlota's room is ajar, so I peek inside to see what she's doing. She's sitting upright at her desk with her laptop in front of her. On the screen are a dozen of her schoolmates, all of them, like Carlota, participating in a virtual class. I can tell that their teacher is leading the lesson from her home -- I'm pretty sure they're discussing fractions and decimals -- but Carlota and her friends are following closely along as if she were talking to them in person.

Everything seems normal. And yet nothing is.

I live in the same house as Carlota, a wonderful, loving and brilliant 9-year-old girl, and the daughter of Chiquinquira Delgado, my partner. Carlota brought happiness into my life from the moment I met her, just a few months after her birth, and I couldn't imagine this house without her in it. ""Good morning everyone!"" she shouts from her bedroom when she wakes up. Her tireless energy -- she loves to create dance moves -- and curiosity has made the tedium of quarantine a bit easier to endure.

Carlota -- like the roughly half of the world's population living in coronavirus-induced lockdown -- has been stuck at home for several weeks now, and there are times when her sadness and frustration rise to the surface. Like when she wonders, with tears in her eyes, if we'll still be able to throw her a birthday party in May. Or when she wants to get together with her friends and doesn't quite understand why they can't come over. One of our biggest achievements as parents during the crisis was taking Carlota on a short bike ride with one of her friends. The kids enjoyed it, but saying goodbye without touching was really hard for them.

The truth, however, is that Carlota's generation -- there are an estimated 74 million children under 17 in the United States -- is much better prepared than ours to face months of isolation. These young people have been unintentionally training for this moment all their lives. From a very young age, they've been communicating with one another using devices that never existed in my time. So when we told them they couldn't leave the house, all they did was enter ""virtual mode.""","No talking face to face, no hugging or kissing can become an unhealthy habit for this generation.

Technology,How Twitter and Facebook plan to handle Trump's accounts when he leaves office.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/technology/how-twitter-and-facebook-plan-to-handle-trumps-accounts-when-he-leaves-office.html,"Many world leaders generally have wider latitude on Twitter and Facebook because their comments and posts are regarded as political speech that is in the realm of public interest. But what will happen to President Trump's accounts on the social media platforms when he leaves office?

At Tuesday's hearing, Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, said the company would no longer make policy exceptions for Mr. Trump after he leaves office in January.

Your Money,Franchise Success Means Doing Things the Franchiser's Way,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/19/your-money/franchise-success-means-doing-things-the-franchisers-way.html,"FRANCHISES would be at the top of any list of investments people consider a sure bet. After all, the thinking goes, an entrepreneur is buying into an existing company and opening an outlet where none exists. Surely, the money will just pour in. Of course, it isn't that simple. But it can work if you follow the script. And have a bit of luck. ""The nice thing about franchises is you have an entrepreneur who has a product or a service and they have proven they can be successful selling it,"" said Lawrence J. Cohen, president and chief executive of Cookie Associates, which owns 27 franchise stores including Great American Cookies, Pretzelmaker and TCBY outlets. ""They don't guarantee success. But if you do it their way, your chances of success are far greater than if you do it on your own."" Mr. Cohen, known as Doc, who sold 35 Great American Cookies stores in 1998 before building up a new collection, said it took a certain type of entrepreneur to succeed -- one who was comfortable with running a business in a prescribed way. ""If you're selling a Big Mac and you decide to use a plain bun because you don't like the sesame seed bun, well, it's no longer a Big Mac,"" he said.

This would seem to fit in with the other types of nontraditional investments I have been writing about. But unlike investing in film, racehorses and restaurants, franchises, I found, tend to be an investment that is less exciting than the others. For someone who really has a passion for managing a process, though, investing in franchises can be so lucrative that that extra spark may not matter. David Barr, an accountant by training, said that in 1998, after managing the sale of Great American Cookies as chief executive, he had enough money to think about what he wanted to do next. He decided to invest some of it in two Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises and begin a second career as a director on corporate boards. ""I wanted a brand that was a powerful brand, not a start-up, because long term I was looking for something in which I didn't have to be at the counter every day or over the fryer,"" Mr. Barr said. ""It's a true investment because I've never taken a dime out and those two have now acquired 23 franchises."" To keep his investments in Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants and, later, Taco Bell restaurants separate from his day job, he instituted a firm rule: Every restaurant had to be at least 45 minutes but no more than three hours from his home in Marietta, Ga.

""I'm not 100 percent passive,"" he said, noting that he had an operating partner. ""Anyone who thinks that buying a franchise is like buying G.E. stock is crazy. But it's not 40 hours a week."" The biggest drain for passive investors in franchises may be managing the people who are making their investment profitable day to day. ""A lot of people do not pay attention to the people part of the business,"" said Aslam Khan, who started as a dishwasher at a Church's Chicken in 1987 and now owns 165 of the restaurants and employs 6,000 people. ""Chicken doesn't move by itself."" He said he attributed his success to making sure that the people who worked for him were well taken care of. Stephen J. Caldiera, chief executive of the International Franchise Association, a trade group, said having someone to pay attention to the day-to-day operation was crucial. ""The people who just want to invest are smart to hire proven operators,"" he said. ""You're only as good as the people running the business."" One of the misleading numbers for people interested in investing in a franchise is the relatively low franchise fee. Mr. Caldiera said fees started as low as $5,000. Burger King's franchise fee is $50,000 -- but it requires people to have a net worth of $1.5 million and liquid assets of $500,000. These financial requirements are the biggest barrier for investors. McDonald's has a similar $500,000 liquid asset requirement, but the company estimates that equipment and preopening costs range from $959,450 to $2,110,700. The franchise fee is a mere $45,000.

""Over the past several years, the biggest growth in our system has been from second-generation owners,"" Danya Proud, a spokeswoman, said. ""There has been a smaller percentage from outside the system."" That said, a franchisee's child would not be granted a franchise on that basis alone. ""They're taking over a $2.6 million business,"" she said. ""We're not going to take some 23-year-old who has maxed out her credit cards."" Even for newer franchises, the setup costs are steep. Seattle's Best Coffee, which is owned by Starbucks, said the cost to set up a new franchise ranged from $181,835 to $445,035, excluding real estate costs. It doesn't take a math whiz to figure out that you are going to have to sell a lot of coffee to recoup that initial investment. Mr. Khan said he had become an investor in franchises his managers wanted to start, as much to make a return on his money as to help minority business owners like himself get started. ""They got me here, and I can get them here,"" he said. He said he would invest up to 49 percent of the cost of the franchise. For investors who want to turn one franchise into many, the type of franchise they start with matters. Mr. Barr said he chose Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants because he knew it would be easier to get financing for a top-tier franchise, given the track record and customer base. Mr. Barr also advised people who wanted a hands-off role to buy existing franchises instead of building one from scratch. ""If you buy a KFC today that's operating, the next day you're making money,"" he said. ""You're not training staff and opening with no revenue.""

But again, franchises fail, like anything else. Mr. Cohen has had to close Great American Cookie stores, even though he is the longest-serving franchisee in the system. He has also lost his entire investment in a franchise that sold Philly cheesesteaks. And perhaps worse for the passive investor, an investment in a franchise can require more attention than an investor planned on giving it. That happened to Carlyle MacHarg, who made his money in real estate. Mr. MacHarg, 68, said he had purposely steered clear of investing in any type of restaurant, after seeing too many friends regret doing it. But when he was approached by the son of a family friend who was part of a group trying to turn around Pat & Oscar's, a small family restaurant chain based in San Diego, he changed his mind. Mr. MacHarg said the price he paid in June 2010 produced an annual return of 40 percent. He then hired the friend's son to manage the restaurants, and was happy for a year or so. But last September, the company that owned the brand went bankrupt, and Mr. MacHarg found himself leading a group of five other franchisees to get control of the Pat & Oscar's name. They were outbid. Worse, the new owner tried to raise the franchise fees. Mr. MacHarg said the group balked and began looking to rebrand their restaurants under the name O's American Kitchen. ""I've been spending most days, 10 to 12 hours a day, on this,"" he said. ""Everything else I have to deal with is on the back burner. This thing has been all-consuming. "" Despite all of this, he said the restaurants accounted for only 10 percent of his investments. But having gone from passive investor to active manager, he has caught the bug that drives the most passionate franchisees. ""This could really take off,"" he said. ""And if the brand takes off, it really goes."" Then he caught himself.

But it can work if you follow the script. And have a bit of luck. ""The nice thing about franchises is you have an entrepreneur who has a product or a service and they have proven they can be successful selling it,"" said Lawrence J. Cohen, president and chief executive of Cookie Associates, which owns 27 franchise stores including Great American Cookies, Pretzelmaker and TCBY outlets. ""They don't guarantee success. But if you do it their way, your chances of success are far greater than if you do it on your own."" Mr. Cohen, known as Doc, who sold 35 Great American Cookies stores in 1998 before building up a new collection, said it took a certain type of entrepreneur to succeed -- one who was comfortable with running a business in a prescribed way. ""If you're selling a Big Mac and you decide to use a plain bun because you don't like the sesame seed bun, well, it's no longer a Big Mac,"" he said.

This would seem to fit in with the other types of nontraditional investments I have been writing about. But unlike investing in film, racehorses and restaurants, franchises, I found, tend to be an investment that is less exciting than the others. For someone who really has a passion for managing a process, though, investing in franchises can be so lucrative that that extra spark may not matter. David Barr, an accountant by training, said that in 1998, after managing the sale of Great American Cookies as chief executive, he had enough money to think about what he wanted to do next. He decided to invest some of it in two Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises and begin a second career as a director on corporate boards. ""I wanted a brand that was a powerful brand, not a start-up, because long term I was looking for something in which I didn't have to be at the counter every day or over the fryer,"" Mr. Barr said. ""It's a true investment because I've never taken a dime out and those two have now acquired 23 franchises."" To keep his investments in Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants and, later, Taco Bell restaurants separate from his day job, he instituted a firm rule: Every restaurant had to be at least 45 minutes but no more than three hours from his home in Marietta, Ga.

""I'm not 100 percent passive,"" he said, noting that he had an operating partner. ""Anyone who thinks that buying a franchise is like buying G.E. stock is crazy. But it's not 40 hours a week."" The biggest drain for passive investors in franchises may be managing the people who are making their investment profitable day to day. ""A lot of people do not pay attention to the people part of the business,"" said Aslam Khan, who started as a dishwasher at a Church's Chicken in 1987 and now owns 165 of the restaurants and employs 6,000 people. ""Chicken doesn't move by itself."" He said he attributed his success to making sure that the people who worked for him were well taken care of. Stephen J. Caldiera, chief executive of the International Franchise Association, a trade group, said having someone to pay attention to the day-to-day operation was crucial. ""The people who just want to invest are smart to hire proven operators,"" he said. ""You're only as good as the people running the business."" One of the misleading numbers for people interested in investing in a franchise is the relatively low franchise fee. Mr. Caldiera said fees started as low as $5,000. Burger King's franchise fee is $50,000 -- but it requires people to have a net worth of $1.5 million and liquid assets of $500,000. These financial requirements are the biggest barrier for investors. McDonald's has a similar $500,000 liquid asset requirement, but the company estimates that equipment and preopening costs range from $959,450 to $2,110,700. The franchise fee is a mere $45,000.

""Over the past several years, the biggest growth in our system has been from second-generation owners,"" Danya Proud, a spokeswoman, said. ""There has been a smaller percentage from outside the system."" That said, a franchisee's child would not be granted a franchise on that basis alone. ""They're taking over a $2.6 million business,"" she said. ""We're not going to take some 23-year-old who has maxed out her credit cards."" Even for newer franchises, the setup costs are steep. Seattle's Best Coffee, which is owned by Starbucks, said the cost to set up a new franchise ranged from $181,835 to $445,035, excluding real estate costs. It doesn't take a math whiz to figure out that you are going to have to sell a lot of coffee to recoup that initial investment. Mr. Khan said he had become an investor in franchises his managers wanted to start, as much to make a return on his money as to help minority business owners like himself get started. ""They got me here, and I can get them here,"" he said. He said he would invest up to 49 percent of the cost of the franchise. For investors who want to turn one franchise into many, the type of franchise they start with matters. Mr. Barr said he chose Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants because he knew it would be easier to get financing for a top-tier franchise, given the track record and customer base. Mr. Barr also advised people who wanted a hands-off role to buy existing franchises instead of building one from scratch. ""If you buy a KFC today that's operating, the next day you're making money,"" he said. ""You're not training staff and opening with no revenue.""

But again, franchises fail, like anything else. Mr. Cohen has had to close Great American Cookie stores, even though he is the longest-serving franchisee in the system. He has also lost his entire investment in a franchise that sold Philly cheesesteaks. And perhaps worse for the passive investor, an investment in a franchise can require more attention than an investor planned on giving it. That happened to Carlyle MacHarg, who made his money in real estate. Mr. MacHarg, 68, said he had purposely steered clear of investing in any type of restaurant, after seeing too many friends regret doing it. But when he was approached by the son of a family friend who was part of a group trying to turn around Pat & Oscar's, a small family restaurant chain based in San Diego, he changed his mind. Mr. MacHarg said the price he paid in June 2010 produced an annual return of 40 percent. He then hired the friend's son to manage the restaurants, and was happy for a year or so. But last September, the company that owned the brand went bankrupt, and Mr. MacHarg found himself leading a group of five other franchisees to get control of the Pat & Oscar's name. They were outbid. Worse, the new owner tried to raise the franchise fees. Mr. MacHarg said the group balked and began looking to rebrand their restaurants under the name O's American Kitchen. ""I've been spending most days, 10 to 12 hours a day, on this,"" he said. ""Everything else I have to deal with is on the back burner. This thing has been all-consuming. "" Despite all of this, he said the restaurants accounted for only 10 percent of his investments. But having gone from passive investor to active manager, he has caught the bug that drives the most passionate franchisees. ""This could really take off,"" he said. ""And if the brand takes off, it really goes."" Then he caught himself. ""Or it could be fine for our nine restaurants."" Investing in an franchise can seem like a sure bet, but success requires an ability to run a business the franchiser's way, as well as some luck.",24,['24'],24

Theater,"A Play About God and Trump, From a Writer Raised on the Right",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/theater/heroes-of-the-fourth-turning-will-arbery.html,"Asking audiences to sit with characters whose beliefs they don't share is a ""radical act,"" says the playwright Will Arbery.





A Play About God and Trump, From a Writer Raised on the Right

For a young playwright in New York, it's one thing to draw buzz from critics and theater fans. It's quite another to have your dense and boundary-pushing Off Broadway play become a talking point among religious conservatives -- and not because they hate it. Shortly before the opening last week of ""Heroes of the Fourth Turning"" -- his new play about a group of conservative Roman Catholic millennials arguing all night in a Wyoming backyard about God, love and Donald Trump -- Will Arbery sent the script to Rod Dreher, the prominent Orthodox Christian blogger. And Dreher responded with an exuberant 5,000-word blog post, praising the play's ""depth of moral vision"" and declaring, ""I don't know how anyone -- progressive, conservative, anyone -- walks out of 'Heroes of the Fourth Turning' without the conviction that somehow, they have to change their life.""

""I would never want this play to breed any complacency on either side,"" he said over lunch at a cafe in Park Slope, Brooklyn. ""This was a play that was meant to trouble."" ""Heroes of the Fourth Turning,"" directed by Danya Taymor and extended through Nov. 10 at Playwrights Horizons, is hardly the first play to be hailed as illuminating our polarized political moment. (Jesse Green, in The New York Times, called it ""astonishing"" and ""riveting."") But where most works of theater seen as ""explaining Trump"" have explored the economic anxieties of the Rust Belt white working-class, ""Heroes"" focuses on the distinctive, heady and what Arbery calls the ""secretive"" world of conservative Catholic intellectuals. It's a world Arbery, who recently turned 30, knows well. His father, a literary scholar, is currently the president of Wyoming Catholic College, a tiny conservative institution whose mixture of Outward Bound-style wilderness training and Great Books curriculum inspired the play's fictional Transfiguration College. His mother, a political philosopher, also teaches there.

Arbery, the only boy in a family of seven sisters, describes his parents as supportive of all their children following their passions. Which doesn't mean he wasn't so nervous before showing them the script for the first time that he had to go into therapy. ""It ended up being great, but I was really scared,"" he said. ""I am a sort of quiet and affable presence in my family, and this felt like such a declaration of how much I'd been listening and absorbing."" He grew up in Texas, where his parents ran a cultural organization connected with the University of Dallas, a Catholic institution. It was a home full of art and argument, he recalls, where dinner-table conversation was likely to include discussion of Machiavelli, Shakespeare and St. Augustine. He wrote and acted in plays at an all-boys school run by Hungarian monks, and also devoured every movie he could find at the public library. ""I always felt a tension between the very rich, complex, nuanced, passionate hive of ideas and faith that was my household, and all the beauty of everything else and everyone else,"" Arbery said. ""I was always pulled between those two, and endlessly curious about everyone else."" He began the process of ""uncoiling,"" as he puts it, at the secular Kenyon College , where he majored in English and drama, and attended Mass regularly until about halfway through his junior year. Today, Arbery -- who wears hipster-nerd glasses and described his plays as partly about ""unpacking whiteness"" -- might blend in with any number of self-questioning, progressive-minded young artists in Brooklyn. Asked about his current relationship to Catholicism, Arbery, already given to thoughtful pauses, paused even longer.

""I struggle with it,"" he said. ""I don't know how to even put it into words."" He paused again. ""I feel called to investigate that rather than deny it."" And then again. ""It was hard for me to admit this, but to deny myself my own particularity was not what the world was asking of me."" Arbery, who received an M.F.A. at Northwestern University, drew on his family obliquely in ""Plano,"" a surreal comedy about three Catholic sisters haunted by the men in their lives (and, seemingly, an actual ghost) that was produced by Clubbed Thumb last spring at the Connelly Theater in the East Village.

""Heroes,"" with its more frontal turn toward the world of his parents, grew out of a short piece presented at Ensemble Studio Theater the Sunday before the 2016 election. Set in the imagined aftermath, it featured early versions of some of the same characters bemoaning what Arbery presumed would be a Hillary Clinton victory. Instead, of course, Donald Trump won, sending Arbery, along with most of the predominantly progressive New York theater world, into disoriented shock, and convincing him that he needed to write a full play. ""I personally felt a lot of anger, and perceived a lot of anger, at the people who could've made that happen,"" he recalled. ""I just felt like I had a responsibility to write about five of those people."" Running two intermission-less hours, ""Heroes"" unfurls in big sweeps of intense, rapid-fire political and theological debate intertwined with revelations of its characters' complicated histories with each other. Hannah Arendt, Martin Heidegger and ""The Benedict Option"" (Dreher's manifesto arguing that Christians, having lost the culture war, should build their own counterculture) are invoked. So are ""Portlandia,"" ""BoJack Horseman"" and Townes Van Zandt.

The play takes its title from ""The Fourth Turning,"" a 1997 pop-history treatise on the supposed cycles of American history by William Strauss and Neil Howe that has been embraced by Steve Bannon, and by the character Teresa, an ambitious, Bannon-loving writer living in Brooklyn, who enthusiastically warns, ""There's a war coming, dude."" As it happens, Teresa's hunger for culture war, and the skeptical reaction from some other characters, echoes a recent ideological clash among real-life conservatives. And some of the combatants have stopped by to see Arbery's take on it. At one preview, R.R. Reno, the editor of First Things, sat with Sohrab Ahmari , the op-ed editor at The New York Post and author of a recent manifesto in the journal calling on conservatives to stop being ""nice"" and fight back against drag-queen story hours at public libraries and other weapons of progressive ""mono-thought."" It touched off months of fierce debate on the right. Both men, like much of the audience, could be seen doubling over in laughter at some of the play's comic high points, including a scene where a recitation of the rosary is interrupted by a spectacularly messy bit of bodily stage business. Reno, who is friendly with Arbery's parents, said that even just presenting anti-abortion and anti-L.G.B.T. views onstage without signposting those airing them as villains, or satirizing them, was ""huge."" ""They disagree among themselves in profound ways,"" Reno said of the characters, not all of whom admire President Trump. ""But there's no liberal reassuring the audience by correcting them.""

The lack of any overt liberal counterpoint, Arbery said, had been a stumbling block for some theaters that considered staging the play. And it has been a point of criticism for some theatergoers on Show Score, an audience rating site, which Arbery sheepishly confessed to checking ""because I'm a masochist."" The goal, he said, wasn't to convince anyone or to stir empathy -- a concept both he, and the play's characters, question -- but to ask audiences to sit with the characters' ideas, which he calls ""a radical act."" Still, he confessed to having his own doubts as he was writing the play, at one point even ""thinking it was evil."" ""There was the worry that it was just giving a platform to hateful speech, "" he said.

A Play About God and Trump, From a Writer Raised on the Right

For a young playwright in New York, it's one thing to draw buzz from critics and theater fans. It's quite another to have your dense and boundary-pushing Off Broadway play become a talking point among religious conservatives -- and not because they hate it. Shortly before the opening last week of ""Heroes of the Fourth Turning"" -- his new play about a group of conservative Roman Catholic millennials arguing all night in a Wyoming backyard about God, love and Donald Trump -- Will Arbery sent the script to Rod Dreher, the prominent Orthodox Christian blogger. And Dreher responded with an exuberant 5,000-word blog post, praising the play's ""depth of moral vision"" and declaring, ""I don't know how anyone -- progressive, conservative, anyone -- walks out of 'Heroes of the Fourth Turning' without the conviction that somehow, they have to change their life.""

""I would never want this play to breed any complacency on either side,"" he said over lunch at a cafe in Park Slope, Brooklyn. ""This was a play that was meant to trouble."" ""Heroes of the Fourth Turning,"" directed by Danya Taymor and extended through Nov. 10 at Playwrights Horizons, is hardly the first play to be hailed as illuminating our polarized political moment. (Jesse Green, in The New York Times, called it ""astonishing"" and ""riveting."") But where most works of theater seen as ""explaining Trump"" have explored the economic anxieties of the Rust Belt white working-class, ""Heroes"" focuses on the distinctive, heady and what Arbery calls the ""secretive"" world of conservative Catholic intellectuals. It's a world Arbery, who recently turned 30, knows well. His father, a literary scholar, is currently the president of Wyoming Catholic College, a tiny conservative institution whose mixture of Outward Bound-style wilderness training and Great Books curriculum inspired the play's fictional Transfiguration College. His mother, a political philosopher, also teaches there.

Arbery, the only boy in a family of seven sisters, describes his parents as supportive of all their children following their passions. Which doesn't mean he wasn't so nervous before showing them the script for the first time that he had to go into therapy. ""It ended up being great, but I was really scared,"" he said. ""I am a sort of quiet and affable presence in my family, and this felt like such a declaration of how much I'd been listening and absorbing."" He grew up in Texas, where his parents ran a cultural organization connected with the University of Dallas, a Catholic institution. It was a home full of art and argument, he recalls, where dinner-table conversation was likely to include discussion of Machiavelli, Shakespeare and St. Augustine. He wrote and acted in plays at an all-boys school run by Hungarian monks, and also devoured every movie he could find at the public library. ""I always felt a tension between the very rich, complex, nuanced, passionate hive of ideas and faith that was my household, and all the beauty of everything else and everyone else,"" Arbery said. ""I was always pulled between those two, and endlessly curious about everyone else."" He began the process of ""uncoiling,"" as he puts it, at the secular Kenyon College , where he majored in English and drama, and attended Mass regularly until about halfway through his junior year. Today, Arbery -- who wears hipster-nerd glasses and described his plays as partly about ""unpacking whiteness"" -- might blend in with any number of self-questioning, progressive-minded young artists in Brooklyn. Asked about his current relationship to Catholicism, Arbery, already given to thoughtful pauses, paused even longer.

""I struggle with it,"" he said. ""I don't know how to even put it into words."" He paused again. ""I feel called to investigate that rather than deny it."" And then again. ""It was hard for me to admit this, but to deny myself my own particularity was not what the world was asking of me."" Arbery, who received an M.F.A. at Northwestern University, drew on his family obliquely in ""Plano,"" a surreal comedy about three Catholic sisters haunted by the men in their lives (and, seemingly, an actual ghost) that was produced by Clubbed Thumb last spring at the Connelly Theater in the East Village.

""Heroes,"" with its more frontal turn toward the world of his parents, grew out of a short piece presented at Ensemble Studio Theater the Sunday before the 2016 election. Set in the imagined aftermath, it featured early versions of some of the same characters bemoaning what Arbery presumed would be a Hillary Clinton victory. Instead, of course, Donald Trump won, sending Arbery, along with most of the predominantly progressive New York theater world, into disoriented shock, and convincing him that he needed to write a full play. ""I personally felt a lot of anger, and perceived a lot of anger, at the people who could've made that happen,"" he recalled. ""I just felt like I had a responsibility to write about five of those people."" Running two intermission-less hours, ""Heroes"" unfurls in big sweeps of intense, rapid-fire political and theological debate intertwined with revelations of its characters' complicated histories with each other. Hannah Arendt, Martin Heidegger and ""The Benedict Option"" (Dreher's manifesto arguing that Christians, having lost the culture war, should build their own counterculture) are invoked. So are ""Portlandia,"" ""BoJack Horseman"" and Townes Van Zandt.

The play takes its title from ""The Fourth Turning,"" a 1997 pop-history treatise on the supposed cycles of American history by William Strauss and Neil Howe that has been embraced by Steve Bannon, and by the character Teresa, an ambitious, Bannon-loving writer living in Brooklyn, who enthusiastically warns, ""There's a war coming, dude."" As it happens, Teresa's hunger for culture war, and the skeptical reaction from some other characters, echoes a recent ideological clash among real-life conservatives. And some of the combatants have stopped by to see Arbery's take on it. At one preview, R.R. Reno, the editor of First Things, sat with Sohrab Ahmari , the op-ed editor at The New York Post and author of a recent manifesto in the journal calling on conservatives to stop being ""nice"" and fight back against drag-queen story hours at public libraries and other weapons of progressive ""mono-thought."" It touched off months of fierce debate on the right. Both men, like much of the audience, could be seen doubling over in laughter at some of the play's comic high points, including a scene where a recitation of the rosary is interrupted by a spectacularly messy bit of bodily stage business. Reno, who is friendly with Arbery's parents, said that even just presenting anti-abortion and anti-L.G.B.T. views onstage without signposting those airing them as villains, or satirizing them, was ""huge."" ""They disagree among themselves in profound ways,"" Reno said of the characters, not all of whom admire President Trump. ""But there's no liberal reassuring the audience by correcting them.""

The lack of any overt liberal counterpoint, Arbery said, had been a stumbling block for some theaters that considered staging the play. And it has been a point of criticism for some theatergoers on Show Score, an audience rating site, which Arbery sheepishly confessed to checking ""because I'm a masochist."" The goal, he said, wasn't to convince anyone or to stir empathy -- a concept both he, and the play's characters, question -- but to ask audiences to sit with the characters' ideas, which he calls ""a radical act."" Still, he confessed to having his own doubts as he was writing the play, at one point even ""thinking it was evil."" ""There was the worry that it was just giving a platform to hateful speech, "" he said. ""And there was the worry that I was exploiting people I love, using their story and their pain for my benefit.""

Theater,"Review: For These African Immigrants, Life Is a Haunted House",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/theater/review-runboyrun-in-old-age.html,"In ' runboyrun ' and 'In Old Age,' the latest installments of Mfoniso Udofia's nine-play cycle, America is no place to hide from the past.

When we first met Abasiama in Mfoniso Udofia's play ""Sojourners,"" it was 1978 and she had come to the United States temporarily, to study biology at Texas Southern University. But when she showed up again in ""Her Portmanteau,"" 36 years had elapsed and she still hadn't returned to Nigeria. ""Sojourners"" and ""Her Portmanteau,"" both extraordinary, were presented in repertory at New York Theater Workshop in 2017, announcing not only a formidable dramatic talent in Ms. Udofia but also a formidable main character in Abasiama. Pregnant with the child of her wayward first husband, she had to decide in ""Sojourners"" whether to leave or stay -- and, either way, how to make a home out of nothing. Though ""Her Portmanteau"" left Abasiama seemingly settled in middle age, with a second husband -- Disciple Ufot -- and four adult children, there was still much to learn about her and her family. ""Sojourners"" was merely play No. 1, and ""Her Portmanteau"" play No. 4, in a projected nine-part work called the Ufot cycle. Now, with the opening on Monday of ""runboyrun"" and ""In Old Age,"" New York Theater Workshop brings us installments No. 3 and No. 8. (Two more have been written and three others are still ""under construction."") Together, the new plays deepen our understanding of the invisible burdens that can weigh down the lives of even the most successful immigrants.

That the burdens are not as fresh or surprising as in the earlier works may be the inevitable result of time's passing within the world Ms. Udofia created. ""Sojourners"" already established the incipient mental disarray threatening to undermine Disciple (Chike Johnson) and thus his uneasy new alliance with Abasiama (Patrice Johnson Chevannes). By the time ""runboyrun,"" directed by Loretta Greco, finds them locked in the same struggle decades later, there is little drama left in it. Indeed, Disciple's life in 2012 is not a new disaster. Though a brilliant scholar of African history, he finds himself at 56 an adjunct teacher at a community college, where he has recently been the subject of complaints by students about his hygiene. At home, in a careworn old pile of a house in Worcester, Mass., he alternates between muteness and mania, trying to cleanse the rooms of unwelcome spirits but also wildly accusing Abasiama of sleeping with men at her church. In response to years of this treatment, Abasiama has become almost larval in her despair. As the play begins she hibernates on the living room sofa, so bundled under blankets (the house is under-heated) that she seems to have become a part of it. Even so, she eventually bestirs herself to tell Disciple that she wants a divorce. If it is the first time she has done so, it will not be the last. But ""runboyrun"" complicates this domestic drama with what amounts to a ghost story; there are other characters living in the house, or at least in Disciple's delusions of it. These are his mother and siblings and younger self, in 1968, noncombatants caught in the midst of Nigeria's civil war over the breakaway region of Biafra. Nearly starving, frequently shelled, unthinkably brave, they help us identify, reasonably but perhaps too neatly, Disciple's lifelong problems as a form of post-traumatic stress. ""Sometimes peace cannot exist,"" his mother tells him in one of these flashbacks. Though she is referring to the unhinged animosities of war, we understand the phrase to apply to individuals as well.

Ms. Greco does a smart job of abutting and gradually intertwining the stories; at times, under Oona Curley's lighting, they almost appear to be shot on two different film stocks. But the staging is unable to overcome a static quality in the 2012 scenes, which keep repeating the same dynamic -- accusation and resignation -- until finally Abasiama pulls herself together in an effort to end the abuse. Though it's a moving moment when she begins to get through to her husband with tough love, the play nevertheless leaves you doubting her success. The story, Ms. Udofia suggests, is destined to repeat itself; there is only so far one can run from the past.

That thesis is put to an extreme test in the second half of the double bill, ""In Old Age."" Set ""in a future far removed,"" it picks up Abasiama's story some years after Disciple's death, when you think she might at last be free from his chaos. But no, just as he was forever haunted by the war he once lived through, she is forever haunted by him; using the voice of the house itself he shouts at her day and night in a symphony of clangs and creaks that would drive anyone crazy. (The sound designer David Van Tieghem should get an award, or a summons.) However dark the subject, ""In Old Age"" is structured as a comedy, and a familiar one at that: a comedy of attrition. Over the course of a week's worth of visits, Azell Abernathy, a handyman hired by Abasiama's adult children to replace the old house's creaky floors, gradually wears down her terrifying resistance and opens her up to renewal. You can tell how little independent function Azell (Ron Canada) has in the proceedings by keeping an eye on his ""work""; as directed by Awoye Timpo, he keeps measuring the same few inches without getting anything done. A character like that, central neither to the Ufot story nor, it appears, to his own, could only get work in a play.

When we first met Abasiama in Mfoniso Udofia's play ""Sojourners,"" it was 1978 and she had come to the United States temporarily, to study biology at Texas Southern University. But when she showed up again in ""Her Portmanteau,"" 36 years had elapsed and she still hadn't returned to Nigeria. ""Sojourners"" and ""Her Portmanteau,"" both extraordinary, were presented in repertory at New York Theater Workshop in 2017, announcing not only a formidable dramatic talent in Ms. Udofia but also a formidable main character in Abasiama. Pregnant with the child of her wayward first husband, she had to decide in ""Sojourners"" whether to leave or stay -- and, either way, how to make a home out of nothing. Though ""Her Portmanteau"" left Abasiama seemingly settled in middle age, with a second husband -- Disciple Ufot -- and four adult children, there was still much to learn about her and her family. ""Sojourners"" was merely play No. 1, and ""Her Portmanteau"" play No. 4, in a projected nine-part work called the Ufot cycle. Now, with the opening on Monday of ""runboyrun"" and ""In Old Age,"" New York Theater Workshop brings us installments No. 3 and No. 8. (Two more have been written and three others are still ""under construction."") Together, the new plays deepen our understanding of the invisible burdens that can weigh down the lives of even the most successful immigrants.

That the burdens are not as fresh or surprising as in the earlier works may be the inevitable result of time's passing within the world Ms. Udofia created. ""Sojourners"" already established the incipient mental disarray threatening to undermine Disciple (Chike Johnson) and thus his uneasy new alliance with Abasiama (Patrice Johnson Chevannes). By the time ""runboyrun,"" directed by Loretta Greco, finds them locked in the same struggle decades later, there is little drama left in it. Indeed, Disciple's life in 2012 is not a new disaster. Though a brilliant scholar of African history, he finds himself at 56 an adjunct teacher at a community college, where he has recently been the subject of complaints by students about his hygiene. At home, in a careworn old pile of a house in Worcester, Mass., he alternates between muteness and mania, trying to cleanse the rooms of unwelcome spirits but also wildly accusing Abasiama of sleeping with men at her church. In response to years of this treatment, Abasiama has become almost larval in her despair. As the play begins she hibernates on the living room sofa, so bundled under blankets (the house is under-heated) that she seems to have become a part of it. Even so, she eventually bestirs herself to tell Disciple that she wants a divorce. If it is the first time she has done so, it will not be the last. But ""runboyrun"" complicates this domestic drama with what amounts to a ghost story; there are other characters living in the house, or at least in Disciple's delusions of it. These are his mother and siblings and younger self, in 1968, noncombatants caught in the midst of Nigeria's civil war over the breakaway region of Biafra. Nearly starving, frequently shelled, unthinkably brave, they help us identify, reasonably but perhaps too neatly, Disciple's lifelong problems as a form of post-traumatic stress. ""Sometimes peace cannot exist,"" his mother tells him in one of these flashbacks. Though she is referring to the unhinged animosities of war, we understand the phrase to apply to individuals as well.

Ms. Greco does a smart job of abutting and gradually intertwining the stories; at times, under Oona Curley's lighting, they almost appear to be shot on two different film stocks. But the staging is unable to overcome a static quality in the 2012 scenes, which keep repeating the same dynamic -- accusation and resignation -- until finally Abasiama pulls herself together in an effort to end the abuse. Though it's a moving moment when she begins to get through to her husband with tough love, the play nevertheless leaves you doubting her success. The story, Ms. Udofia suggests, is destined to repeat itself; there is only so far one can run from the past.

That thesis is put to an extreme test in the second half of the double bill, ""In Old Age."" Set ""in a future far removed,"" it picks up Abasiama's story some years after Disciple's death, when you think she might at last be free from his chaos. But no, just as he was forever haunted by the war he once lived through, she is forever haunted by him; using the voice of the house itself he shouts at her day and night in a symphony of clangs and creaks that would drive anyone crazy. (The sound designer David Van Tieghem should get an award, or a summons.) However dark the subject, ""In Old Age"" is structured as a comedy, and a familiar one at that: a comedy of attrition. Over the course of a week's worth of visits, Azell Abernathy, a handyman hired by Abasiama's adult children to replace the old house's creaky floors, gradually wears down her terrifying resistance and opens her up to renewal. You can tell how little independent function Azell (Ron Canada) has in the proceedings by keeping an eye on his ""work""; as directed by Awoye Timpo, he keeps measuring the same few inches without getting anything done. A character like that, central neither to the Ufot story nor, it appears, to his own, could only get work in a play. He is a prop, there merely to jimmy Abasiama into conflict with forces he has nothing to do with: the deceased Disciple and the noisy house itself.

Television,"Trump, Political TV's Protagonist, Now Has to Share the Spotlight",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/arts/television/trump-state-of-the-union.html,"In 2011, Donald J. Trump, host of ""The Celebrity Apprentice,"" was the star of a Comedy Central roast, a familiar ritual for showbiz personae. The guest of honor sits stage center and gets insulted, then everyone laughs it off as all in good fun. The State of the Union address, under President Trump, has become something like a celebrity roast in reverse. In this ritual, the center of attention stands at the podium, he says things about working together and getting along, and after it's done, everyone goes on their way, assuming he didn't really mean it. So while the advance spin about the president's speech Tuesday was that it would emphasize ""unity"" and ""bipartisanship,"" the pre-address coverage on cable news was less credulous than before. Mr. Trump had, perhaps, finally been the wolf who cried boy too many times. (He had, in a lunch with news anchors that same day, already called Senator Chuck Schumer a ""nasty son of a bitch."") Beyond that, there was a sense, with Democrats having swept into control of the House and opponents lining up to run in 2020, that the president was no longer the sole focus of the show. Having served, since announcing his campaign in 2015, as the norm-breaking antihero protagonist of America's political TV serial, he now had to share billing with a vast ensemble of co-stars.

There was, of course, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the ubiquitous new representative from Queens, doing interviews before the speech on CNN and after it on NBC. There was a house full of adversaries and potential opponents in the room, as the cameras darted from face to face to catch the reactions of Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and more. Arguably, the expressions of incredulity and sardonic shade were statements as politically significant as anything President Trump read from his text. It was like a miniature primary of smirks and grimaces, pitched to any of the Democratic base watching, or catching up on social media. One declared Democratic candidate, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, sent out one of her reaction GIFs on Twitter to raise campaign donations mid-speech. Elsewhere on Twitter, Trump detractors circulated a picture of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, perfunctorily applauding in the president's direction, as if handing him one small clap on a tiny hors d'oeuvre tray.

President Trump, never a strong reader off the prompter, read through sections at a slow cadence, then slam-cut through jarring segues. As at his rallies, and on reality TV, he was more comfortable in the moments he could improvise and play off the crowd. As he introduced a Holocaust survivor celebrating his birthday, the room broke into ""Happy Birthday,"" and Mr. Trump made an orchestra-conducting gesture. But there was more dissonance than harmony. An upbeat section on the economy closed with a dark warning that investigations of him would bring it all crashing down, wrapped up with a Johnnie Cochran-esque rhyme: ""If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation."" The speech made hairpin turns from uplift to fearmongering and back. Stacey Abrams, the former candidate for governor in Georgia, gave the Democratic response. This is typically a thankless job, but her speech may have benefited simply from being comparatively short, focused and sustained in tone. Fittingly, the most boisterous cross-partisan cheers were ironic. When Mr. Trump referenced the women's employment rate, a crowd of Democratic women celebrated -- many of them having taken the jobs of the president's supporters. It was one of many striking visuals of the night, and not just because the congresswomen were dressed in suffragist white. The new class of representatives also contrasted sharply with the throngs of Republicans -- mostly white, mostly men -- who lined the aisle to glad hand the president as he walked into the hall.

Mr. Trump extended the moment. ""Don't sit, you're going to like this,"" he ad-libbed, adding that there were now more women serving in Congress than ever, which was the closest he came in the speech to congratulating his opponents on their win. They cheered even louder, if more defiantly than he might have planned. For the former TV host, it was perhaps the old showman's trick of seeking to hang onto the spotlight by ceding it. For them, it was a chance to emphasize that this new face of the Congress likely would not be there, if not in reaction to Donald Trump.

Your Money,A Push to Invest in the Arts Grows Stronger,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/19/your-money/impact-investing-art-funding.html,"One of Lorrie Meyercord's investments will be La MaMa, a theatrical organization and performance space with more than 50 years of work in the East Village.

Like an out-of-town tryout for a Broadway musical, Lorrie Meyercord tested her desire to make an investment in the creative economy by choosing a small city before moving to New York. She invested $1 million in artist housing in Dearborn, Mich., in 2016 through a nonprofit group called Artspace, which builds and manages affordable residences for artists and art organizations. The venture was a success because it gave the arts community broader social support while also providing Ms. Meyercord with a safe investment. The concept is known as impact investing, in which investors consider social good in addition to financial returns. It was also a path to expand the way people think about investing in the arts, an area often overlooked by investors. Two years later, Ms. Meyercord is making a similar investment, but this time, she is focused on the thriving New York art scene.

Working with Upstart Co-Lab, which channels impact investing into the arts, Ms. Meyercord has invested $100,000 in a bond offering that will raise at least $5 million for projects in New York. The recipients, which will be announced on Monday, include La MaMa, a theatrical organization and performance space with more than 50 years of work in the East Village. The organization is receiving a $3.2 million line of credit that will help pay to renovate its main theater. ""So many people are looking at the bottom line and not understanding how this loan affects our local economy,"" said Mia Yoo, artistic director of La MaMa, noting the group employs 45 people but give opportunities to about 1,500 artists a year. ""La MaMa is dealing with experimental work and trying things for the first time,"" she said. ""The impact of it, we don't see for years."" She pointed to Julie Taymor, who produced early works at La MaMa in the 1980s, long before winning a Tony for directing the musical ""The Lion King"" in 1997.

Impact investing has matured in the past decade. There is now an abundance of projects in clean water, education and low-income housing, but growth in arts investing has been slow. ""The arts by their nature are intangible, and so their results are intangible,"" said Evan Beard, national art services executive at U.S. Trust, a private bank for high net-worth individuals. ""There are metrics to say how many people got clean water or how many were cured of malaria. The metrics on this are challenging."" Since Upstart Co-Lab was founded in 2015, it has helped increase interest in impact investing in the arts because ""we learned how to talk about this and frame it,"" said Laura Callanan, a founding partner.

""Talking about what's in and what's out of the creative economy makes a lot of sense,"" Ms. Callanan added. She has also been able to point to the success of the Artspace investments. The Michigan project, which I wrote about in 2016, consists of 55 units of housing for artists and 20,000 square feet of commercial space focused on the arts. The investment was structured like a revolving line of credit, which has been drawn from again several times. Artspace was able to use the money to fund a similar project in Memphis.

The success has attracted more interest. Ms. Meyercord's $1 million investment in the first project accounted for 40 percent of the $2.5 million that went to Artspace. Both then and now, Upstart teamed up with organizations that are known for their socially responsible investing: first with the Calvert Foundation, a mutual fund that organized the investment in Artspace, and this time with the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a lender known as LISC that underwrote the bond. The New York investment is focused on the blue-collar workers in the arts community, particularly as manufacturing jobs in the city shrink. ""It's not just the financial expectations and whether they're a good bet as a borrower but also their impact on the neighborhood,"" Ms. Callanan said. ""The whole point is that these are jobs people can do across a lifetime."" For recipients, the money often comes at a crucial time. ""When Artspace goes out to do a project, predevelopment funding is impossible to raise money for,"" said Kathleen Kvern, president of national advancement at Artspace. ""This allows us to start work and go raise money later,"" she said. ""It's enabled us to start these projects when we didn't have a predevelopment contract."" She said the group envisioned recycling a five-year line of credit several more times, which differs from grants, which are given for a specific project. The downside, though: ""These are loans,"" Ms. Kvern said, and they have to be paid back. And because Artspace is building permanent, affordable housing, the loans are going to be paid back not with a windfall but with consistent rents and fund-raising.

Some advisers argue, though, that impact investing in the creative economy could remain a hard sell compared with more common recipients of such funding like education and health care. Mr. Beard, who focuses on art lending at U.S. Trust, said there had been an uptick in using art to fund other philanthropic endeavors. He cited Agnes Gund's sale of a $150 million Roy Lichtenstein painting to start a criminal justice fund, called Art for Justice. Others, he said, are borrowing against their art to make traditional grants to organizations. And traditional art funding -- through philanthropy and private buyers -- has worked well, Mr. Beard said.

""Does our art system need impact investing?"" he said. ""We already have this very dynamic art model that goes out in the world. That may be why we've seen a failure to launch with impact investing in the arts."" But groups like Upstart Co-Lab and LISC are looking to invest in a broadly defined creative economy, which can include traditional arts organizations like La MaMa but also small manufacturing companies that make high-end cabinetry and retail displays. ""We're providing an opportunity to invest in arts culture and creativity,"" said Sam Marks, executive director of the New York office of LISC. ""We're trying to create a new channel of investment capital. This is about benefits for low- and moderate-income people.""

That channel is not necessarily a risky one, but it's also not a lucrative one, either. The eight-year note on the New York project, which pays annual interest of 2.75 percent, is backed by LISC, which has an investment-grade rating. Katherine Fulton, an independent philanthropic consultant in Northern California, said she was looking for impact investments in the arts but felt limited. Most of the savings that she and her wife, Katharine Kunst, an artist, have are managed by a large brokerage firm that does not have impact offerings. Until they made a $100,000 investment in the New York project, they felt there were not a lot of options for affluent investors. ""We needed to find something that was easy to do,"" Ms. Fulton said. ""It's a safe return. It's not a high return. But it's also important because cities and urban spaces need the creative economy."" Of course, just labeling a deal as an impact investment in the arts does not make it a great investment. Ms. Meyercord said she toured a site in upstate New York that was aiming to revitalize a former manufacturing town with a film production facility. ""It was really cool, but there wasn't a clear-cut way to get involved,"" she said. ""I don't live in New York, and I wasn't going to come in and spearhead the whole thing."" The investments in New York and Dearborn were essentially in real estate, which in turn will be used in some form by artists. It's easy to grasp how an investor will be repaid.

Ms. Meyercord estimated that six of her 25 impact investments were in the arts. She said she was happy with the investments she had made so far, but wished there were more people looking for deals with her. ""It hasn't been more difficult than I thought,"" she said. ""I would like to find more people like myself who are sourcing these projects and I can collaborate with. I haven't necessarily found other investors who make this a top priority."" There is a silver lining: ""Other investors think it's interesting, and they're happy to get on board. There just needs to be someone to do the legwork.""","Impact investing — which considers social good in addition to financial returns — has matured in the past decade, and some investors are turning more attention to the arts.",9be90271-1a6e-5191-ba6f-46d249c70620,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/20/business/20WEALTH-01/20WEALTH-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=f4604d6523f8554d76777b51e1b68e45fec661b772d5060fec2829ff9c8a6818&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"<p>One of Lorrie Meyercord's investments will be La MaMa, a theatrical organization and performance space with more than 50 years of work in the East Village.</p>",9be90271-1a6e-5191-ba6f-46d249c70620,Demo_data/D1_img2/19be90271-1a6e-5191-ba6f-46d249c70620.jpg,21,"A Push to Invest in the Arts Grows Stronger One of Lorrie Meyercord's investments will be La MaMa, a theatrical organization and performance space with more than 50 years of work in the East Village.

Granted, the back story to their coupledom is unusual, maybe even by the standards of the French, whose current and past leaders have been embroiled in very public romantic dramas. Ms. Macron first met Mr. Macron when he was 15 and she was his teacher, married with three children, at a high school in Amiens, France. The two became close after Mr. Macron asked her to help him rewrite sections of a play. Before Mr. Macron moved to Paris to continue his schooling, he declared, at age 17, that he would one day marry his teacher. He did, in 2007.

The specifics of their love have generated headlines, commentary and opinion pieces around the world. A Forbes article asked: ""Who Is the Older Woman That Could Become France's First Lady?"" A feminist think piece in The Guardian responded to a heavy-on-the-sarcasm column in The Daily Mail that portrayed Mr. Macron as a ""mummy's boy"" who needs Ms. Macron to wipe his mouth or give him ""a smack"" for misbehaving. Ms. Macron has been called a ""menopausal Barbie"" and Mr. Macron a teacher's pet.

All the talk even led to wild speculation that Mr. Macron is gay and in a relationship with the chief executive of Radio France, Mathieu Gallet. Mr. Macron dismissed the rumor in February with a joke. Cindy Gallop, a provocative web entrepreneur who has been vocal about her decision to date younger men, points to sexism. ""It makes people very uncomfortable to see the gender equation reversed,"" she said. ""Out there in the world are many, many younger men who would love to date older women, but would never do anything about it because there's this appalling societal double standard."" As unconventional as the Macrons' marriage may seem, the pairing of an older woman with a significantly younger man is not a new one (recall Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher or Madonna and Brahim Zaibat), nor is it that uncommon.

""It's flat out not true. Men want a companion, and we are seeing the rise of women as intellectual partners, as sexual partners, as soul partners.""

Ms. Fisher added that the prevalence of May-December romances involving younger men is part of a general shift in Western culture toward double-income families. With women gaining more economic power, she added, younger men will seek out partners who either make as much money as they do or more, and have similar or higher levels of education.

Technology,A Challenge to Big Tech and Antitrust Thinking in a Surprising Place,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/15/technology/university-of-chicago-technology-antitrust.html,"""The world has changed, and inevitably the Chicago position has to change, too,"" Professor Luigi Zingales told graduates at the University of Chicago, which helped shift antitrust policy in the 1970s.

Convocation speeches are usually filled with inspiring life lessons or sage advice, but this year's graduating class at the University of Chicago heard something else: a battle cry against tech monopolies from one of the school's leading economists. What made the rousing speech surprising was not what he said, but where he said it. The University of Chicago is the intellectual birthplace of the consensus in antitrust thinking over the last four decades -- that monopoly law should place consumer interests, usually in the form of lower prices, above the concerns of smaller business rivals. This hands-off ideology has helped Big Tech amass market power and gobble up potential competitors for years without facing significant antitrust scrutiny. It is so closely associated with the school that the thinking is widely known as ""the Chicago School of antitrust."" But amid growing concerns about the unchecked power of today's tech giants, economists and legal scholars are questioning whether the Chicago School still makes sense. Even the university's own faculty is starting to publicly challenge the ideology.

At a convocation ceremony in June, Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the university's Booth School of Business, warned about the corrosive influence of monopolies and declared that the Chicago School had a blind spot when it came to Big Tech. ""Our antitrust laws cannot do anything against these types of monopolies,"" said Mr. Zingales, who is the head of the university's George J. Stigler Center for the Study of the Economy and the State, in his address. ""The world has changed, and inevitably the Chicago position has to change, too."" A 56-year-old native of Padua, Italy, who has taught at the school since 1992, Mr. Zingales adheres to many of the traditional hallmarks of University of Chicago economics -- free markets, small government and low taxes. But he is not an ideologue. After the financial crisis, he opposed breaking up the big banks but said later that he had been wrong. His recent work laments that the American capitalist system has become corrupted by cronyism and companies that are too big, too powerful and too enmeshed with the overall economy. When the Federal Trade Commission decided to close a broad investigation into Google without taking any action in 2013, Mr. Zingales said in a recent interview, it was clear that regulators were not sufficiently aggressive going after the new monopolies.

Although never shy about speaking out -- he predicted in 2011 that Donald J. Trump could win the presidency -- Mr. Zingales became more vocal about the need for the Chicago School position to evolve. He said that today's tech giants were ""unprecedented in nature"" and that the rules of traditional economics did not apply to these companies. For the last three years, Mr. Zingales and the Stigler Center have hosted an antitrust summit. The 2018 and 2019 conferences focused on how to deal with digital platforms like Google and Facebook. He gathered most of the leading antitrust scholars, a handful of top regulators, judges and attorneys general to come up with proposals on how monopoly policy should deal with the tech giants. Discussions at those two conferences have been echoed in recent decisions by the Justice Department and 50 state attorneys general to investigate antitrust claims against Big Tech. At last year's summit, Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department official in charge of antitrust, told attendees that his view of the cost of free platforms ""has changed"" with a greater understanding of the nature and scope of data collection and sharing. An attorney general at this year's conference, Doug Peterson of Nebraska, was one of the main speakers when states announced an antitrust investigation into Google last week.

Mr. Zingales started a podcast with Kate Waldock, an assistant professor of finance at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business, in 2018 called ""Capitalisn't"" about what works well in the current economy and what does not. Their first episode called for more antitrust enforcement of Facebook and Google, centered on the idea of how dangerous it would be if Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, decided to run for president -- which didn't seem so far-fetched at the time. The Chicago School started to gain prominence in the 1970s in response to concerns about overly aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws. It argued that it was not enough for companies to possess significant market power; regulators and judges had to prove through economic analysis that consumers were harmed through higher prices. The ideology has influenced a generation of judges and regulators, who have taken a restrained approach to antitrust enforcement in the United States based, in part, on the belief that market forces would correct imbalances better. The Chicago School has greased the wheels for the megamergers that have reshaped many industries while providing the intellectual justification for why today's tech giants are not dangerous monopolies. It's hard to argue that Google's or Facebook's market power is hurting prices when their products do not cost money and Amazon -- while not free -- is celebrated for its convenience and prices. Kevin Murphy, who teaches at the Booth School of Business with Mr. Zingales, said he still didn't see a serious alternative to the Chicago School for formulating antitrust policy. He also said there was little evidence that more regulation led to better outcomes for consumers. ""Most of what I see from companies like Amazon, Google and Apple is that they are successful because they do well in the competitive battle,"" Mr. Murphy said. ""The difference between him and I is that he sees a failure of competition, whereas I see the success of the companies.""

Mr. Murphy said, however, that there was not a monolithic view among the university's faculty, especially since many of the professors hadn't been trained at the University of Chicago. ""They would probably agree more with what Luigi is saying compared to what I'm saying,"" he said. But Mr. Zingales said the tech industry's network-driven business models -- based on the notion that a service or a product becomes more useful and valuable as more people rely on it -- was a relatively new area of study for economics. Powerful monopolies like Google are a potential threat to democracy, Mr. Zingales added, because they hold so much sway over what we read. Google declined to comment. Mr. Zingales also noted that the ideology failed to capture the risk of a monopoly's exerting influence to persuade regulators and politicians. In his address, Mr. Zingales implored the graduates to push back against today's tech behemoths, just as the colonists had resisted the monopoly of Britain's East India Company during the Boston Tea Party. He urged the audience to vote for politicians willing to stand up to Silicon Valley. ""This country was born fighting monopolies,"" said Mr. Zingales, who still speaks with a noticeable Italian accent. ""To fight monopolies, your power as workers, consumers and investors is not sufficient. Your participation in the political process is critical. This is not a Republican or Democratic battle. It's an American battle."" Then he addressed the elephant in the room. ""My conclusions may surprise some people who identify Chicago faculty, especially the economic and financial faculty, with a certain ideology. Chicago faculty, however, abide to a method, not an ideology,"" he said. ""It's a method of intellectual inquiry without the blinders imposed by conventional wisdom.""","The University of Chicago has long been associated with the idea that antitrust decisions should be based on prices for consumers, not market dominance.

For the last three years, Mr. Zingales and the Stigler Center have hosted an antitrust summit. The 2018 and 2019 conferences focused on how to deal with digital platforms like Google and Facebook. He gathered most of the leading antitrust scholars, a handful of top regulators, judges and attorneys general to come up with proposals on how monopoly policy should deal with the tech giants. Discussions at those two conferences have been echoed in recent decisions by the Justice Department and 50 state attorneys general to investigate antitrust claims against Big Tech. At last year's summit, Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department official in charge of antitrust, told attendees that his view of the cost of free platforms ""has changed"" with a greater understanding of the nature and scope of data collection and sharing. An attorney general at this year's conference, Doug Peterson of Nebraska, was one of the main speakers when states announced an antitrust investigation into Google last week.

Mr. Zingales started a podcast with Kate Waldock, an assistant professor of finance at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business, in 2018 called ""Capitalisn't"" about what works well in the current economy and what does not. Their first episode called for more antitrust enforcement of Facebook and Google, centered on the idea of how dangerous it would be if Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, decided to run for president -- which didn't seem so far-fetched at the time. The Chicago School started to gain prominence in the 1970s in response to concerns about overly aggressive enforcement of antitrust laws. It argued that it was not enough for companies to possess significant market power; regulators and judges had to prove through economic analysis that consumers were harmed through higher prices. The ideology has influenced a generation of judges and regulators, who have taken a restrained approach to antitrust enforcement in the United States based, in part, on the belief that market forces would correct imbalances better. The Chicago School has greased the wheels for the megamergers that have reshaped many industries while providing the intellectual justification for why today's tech giants are not dangerous monopolies. It's hard to argue that Google's or Facebook's market power is hurting prices when their products do not cost money and Amazon -- while not free -- is celebrated for its convenience and prices. Kevin Murphy, who teaches at the Booth School of Business with Mr. Zingales, said he still didn't see a serious alternative to the Chicago School for formulating antitrust policy. He also said there was little evidence that more regulation led to better outcomes for consumers. ""Most of what I see from companies like Amazon, Google and Apple is that they are successful because they do well in the competitive battle,"" Mr. Murphy said. ""The difference between him and I is that he sees a failure of competition, whereas I see the success of the companies.""

Mr. Murphy said, however, that there was not a monolithic view among the university's faculty, especially since many of the professors hadn't been trained at the University of Chicago. ""They would probably agree more with what Luigi is saying compared to what I'm saying,"" he said. But Mr. Zingales said the tech industry's network-driven business models -- based on the notion that a service or a product becomes more useful and valuable as more people rely on it -- was a relatively new area of study for economics. Powerful monopolies like Google are a potential threat to democracy, Mr. Zingales added, because they hold so much sway over what we read. Google declined to comment. Mr. Zingales also noted that the ideology failed to capture the risk of a monopoly's exerting influence to persuade regulators and politicians. In his address, Mr. Zingales implored the graduates to push back against today's tech behemoths, just as the colonists had resisted the monopoly of Britain's East India Company during the Boston Tea Party. He urged the audience to vote for politicians willing to stand up to Silicon Valley. ""This country was born fighting monopolies,"" said Mr. Zingales, who still speaks with a noticeable Italian accent. ""To fight monopolies, your power as workers, consumers and investors is not sufficient. Your participation in the political process is critical. This is not a Republican or Democratic battle. It's an American battle."" Then he addressed the elephant in the room. ""My conclusions may surprise some people who identify Chicago faculty, especially the economic and financial faculty, with a certain ideology. Chicago faculty, however, abide to a method, not an ideology,"" he said. ""It's a method of intellectual inquiry without the blinders imposed by conventional wisdom."" The University of Chicago has long been associated with the idea that antitrust decisions should be based on prices for consumers, not market dominance. That's starting to change.",24,['24'],24
Health,'At War With No Ammo': Doctors Say Shortage of Protective Gear Is Dire,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/health/coronavirus-masks-shortage.html,"The lack of proper masks, gowns and eye gear is imperiling the ability of medical workers to fight the coronavirus -- and putting their own lives at risk.

'At War With No Ammo': Doctors Say Shortage of Protective Gear Is Dire

The Open Cities Community Health Center in St. Paul, Minn., is considering shutting down because it doesn't have enough face masks. Doctors at Barnes Jewish Hospital in St. Louis are performing invasive procedures on coronavirus patients with loose fitting surgical masks rather than the tight respirator masks recommended by health agencies. At a Los Angeles emergency room, doctors were given a box of expired masks, and when they tried to put them on, the elastic bands snapped. With coronavirus cases soaring, doctors, nurses and other front-line medical workers across the United States are confronting a dire shortage of masks, surgical gowns and eye gear to protect them from the virus.

""There's absolutely no way to protect myself,"" said Dr. Faezah A. Bux, an anesthesiologist in central Kentucky who in recent days had to intubate several elderly patients in respiratory distress without the respirator masks and protective eye gear recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Not only can I not protect myself, I can't protect my patients."" At a White House briefing on Thursday, President Trump said millions of masks were in production and that the federal government had made efforts to address the shortages, though he did not provide details. But he said it was largely up to governors to deal with the problem. ""The federal government's not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items and then shipping,"" Mr. Trump said. ""You know, we're not a shipping clerk.""

In the United States, the number of reported cases grew to more than 11,000 on Thursday, as Senate Republicans released a plan that would provide checks of up to $1,200 for many taxpayers and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California issued an order that state residents ""stay at home."" The president also said there were no immediate plans to address medical equipment shortages by activating the Defense Production Act, a Korean War-era law that authorizes presidents to take extraordinary action to force American industry to ramp up production of equipment needed for national security. ""We hope we are not going to need it,"" he said. The president's optimistic statements contrasted starkly with the situation on the ground, particularly in Washington and New York, the states with the largest number of coronavirus cases. Earlier this week, administrators informed doctors at Memorial Sloan Kettering in Manhattan that they were down to one-week supply of respirator masks, but working to get more, according to a physician familiar with the situation. Rebecca Bartles, who heads infection prevention efforts for the Providence St. Joseph hospital chain based in Washington, said it was only a matter of days before some of the system's 51 hospitals and 800 clinics run out of personal protective equipment -- a situation that imperils the nation's ability to respond to a pandemic still in its early stages. ""We're on mile one of a marathon,"" she said, adding, ""what does mile 25 look like?"" Health care workers' fears are not abstract. Two emergency room doctors in New Jersey and Washington have been hospitalized in critical condition, dozens of other health care workers across the country have already fallen ill and hundreds have been forced into quarantine.

Federal health officials say respirator masks can be used for eight hours of continuous or intermittent use and should be discarded after treating an infected patient. Many doctors around the country said they are being given just one, to use indefinitely, and they spray it down with Lysol or wipe it off, not knowing whether that will help preserve it. Many doctors and nurses say their fears and frustrations have been compounded by guidance from the C.D.C. that they consider unclear and misleading. Recently it changed its guidance to say that regular surgical masks are ""an acceptable alternative"" when examining or treating a coronavirus patient. The change came given the shortages of the special N95 respirator masks. They get their name because they can filter out 95 percent of all airborne particles when used correctly. The agency says that such masks remain essential for doctors during intubations, which involve inserting a breathing tube down a patient's throat. It is a procedure that can more easily spread disease. While some infectious disease doctors defend the guidelines -- noting that surgical masks and protective eyewear are sufficient for everyday patient exchanges -- others argue the new recommendations are borne of political expediency instead of science. The American Nurses Association said the guidelines were creating confusion among its members over how to stay safe.

In an email, the agency acknowledged the shortages, but did not respond to questions about doctors' concerns over its guidance. Howard K. Mell, a spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians, said the crisis requires decisive federal action. He urged the White House to ramp up production of medical gear through the Defense Production Act powers, and he called on federal authorities to increase distributions from the Strategic National Stockpile, a repository of critical medical supplies for public health emergencies. The stockpile has roughly 12 million N95 masks and 30 million surgical masks. The Department of Heath and Human Services, which oversees the stockpile, did not return emails requesting information about the supplies. The department has estimated that the country would need 3.5 billion masks in the event of a pandemic lasting a year. A cache of several thousand face masks and other gear from the stockpile recently arrived in Oregon and Washington. Officials in both states said it was far less than what they had requested. ""If this is a wartime situation, then now is the time to act,"" said Dr. Mell, who is an emergency room doctor in Illinois.

""Every pandemic is local so you have to pull on those local strings so we can help each other,"" said Julie Sullivan-Springhetti, a health department spokesperson. But with limited prospects for speedy government intervention, fear and anxiety continue to mount. In recent days, hundreds of medical workers have taken to social media with public pleas for help using the hashtag #GetMePPE. (P.P.E. stands for personal protective equipment.) A doctor at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis described how she and her colleagues intubated a trauma patient they later discovered was likely infected with Covid-19. All of them wore simple face masks as they worked just inches from the patient's face. ""I'm terrified,"" she said, her voice cracking with emotion as she ended her shift.

Economy,U.S. Retail Sales Gain Slightly,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/13/business/us-retail-sales-gain-slightly.html,"Anyone who waited to buy school supplies in a snaking checkout line at Staples last month may not be surprised that on Friday the Commerce Department reported a healthy 0.6 percent increase in retail sales for August. That growth adds a pebble to the optimists' side of the balance scale but does little to change the widespread sense that the nation's economic recovery remains on a relatively modest, if sometimes halting, upward track. ""The issue is not a question of whether we're growing or shrinking, but whether we're growing or accelerating,"" said Steven Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research. ""This data says we're growing, but without accelerating.""

Michael Gapen, Barclays' chief United States economist, agreed that the latest data on sales showed ""consumer spending will be modest,"" adding ""it doesn't look like it's downshifting, but it doesn't look like it's upshifting either."" Perhaps more significant, however, was the government's revision to the report last month on retail sales for July, raising to 0.3 percent the original estimate of zero. The initial July report spurred worries that ""the consumer-led growth we were taking for granted might be drying up,"" said Douglas Handler, chief economist at IHS, a Boston-based global information company. ""The revision really dispels that a bit."" Retail sales -- which rose to a seasonably adjusted $444.4 billion for August -- are a prime economic engine, accounting for about 45 percent of total consumption. This month's figures are drawing particular attention in anticipation of next week's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Federal Reserve's policy-making group. The stepped-up pace of auto and truck purchases helped lift retail sales the most but there were increases in nearly every category, from electronics and building supplies to groceries and clothing. Not counting the increase in auto sales, spending rose by 0.3 percent.

Back-to-school sales tax holidays in 16 states may have helped nudge consumers into stores. The falloff in gasoline sales was expected given the dip in gas prices, economists said, which meant that consumers had more cash to spend on other things or put into savings.

The Commerce Department also reported on Friday that businesses increased their stockpiles in July, a sign that they expected buyers would keep their wallets open.

Nearly all economists expect growth to slow to a more modest pace during the third quarter, which will end this month.

Television,'El Camino': What to Remember 6 Years After 'Breaking Bad',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/10/arts/television/el-camino-breaking-bad.html,"Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) looks to be the central figure of the new Netflix feature ""El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,"" directed by the ""Breaking Bad"" creator Vince Gilligan.





Six years ago, AMC's award-season juggernaut ""Breaking Bad"" came to a bloody and satisfying end, and with it the story of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), the high school science teacher who became an Albuquerque drug kingpin. AMC quickly spun off a prequel series, ""Better Call Saul,"" giving fans more time with characters like Saul Goodman, Mike Ehrmantraut and Gus Fring. But given that shift in focus -- and all the carnage of the final ""Breaking Bad"" season -- it was reasonable to think that the finale was the last word otherwise.

Then in late 2018, the series's creator, Vince Gilligan, secretly gathered his collaborators in New Mexico and directed his own screenplay for ""El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,"" which comes to Netflix Friday. Judging by the trailer, the movie introduces a bunch of new characters and brings back a few familiar ones, the most important being Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), whom we last saw looking broken but alive, speeding off through the desert in ... an El Camino. But what about the rest? Remember Skinny Pete? And what about poor Flynn? It's been a while, so here's a refresher on where we left the characters who may still have some bearing on the sequel -- alive, dead or somewhere in between.

In Season 5, Walter's right-hand man, Jesse, went through the wringer. First he came to realize just how much Walter had betrayed him. Then he was made a literal slave to meth-dealing white supremacists. We don't know a lot about what happened to Jesse after the desert shootout that killed the D.E.A. agent (and Walt's brother-in-law) Hank Schrader (Dean Norris). But by the time Walter came to save him, his existence looked tortured: imprisoned in the meth lab, cooking for monsters, rarely seeing the light of day. Walter saved him, relying on his usual mix of brazenness and ingenuity (and the help of a remote-controlled machine gun). Jesse sped off into the night, hysterical and screaming. The movie looks to pick up immediately thereafter, so remember the trauma inflicted by Jesse's captivity. It will surely play a role.

The first teaser trailer for ""El Camino"" offered a glimpse of Jesse Pinkman's regular collaborator Skinny Pete (Charles Baker). He appears again in the official trailer, alongside his usual partner, Badger (Matthew Lee Jones). They were two of the last people to do business with Walt. In the series finale, they were paid by Walter to pose as assassins outside of the home of Walter's former business partners the Schwartzes (Jessica Hecht and Adam Godley), a ruse to ensure that the couple would do as they were told. Pete and Badger also revealed to Walter that blue meth was still on the scene. Jesse has turned to them in times of need before. Judging by the trailer, he looks to need their help again.

Saul's lovable bodyguard, Huell (Lavell Crawford), has been the subject of much internet concern as he was last seen being told never to leave a safe house by Agents Schrader and Gomez -- who were then killed by Nazis. Is he still there? If Saul comes back into the picture in ""El Camino,"" he could also bring back one of the few people he thinks he can still trust.

There's a shot of a photo of Jesse's former girlfriend, Andrea, and her son, Brock (Ian Posada and Emily Rios), in the ""El Camino"" trailer, reminding viewers how important they were to Jesse -- and to the plot: The end of ""Breaking Bad"" would have been very different if not for Jesse's realization that Walter had poisoned Brock. In the second-to-last episode, Jesse watched as Todd (Jesse Plemons) murdered Andrea on her porch; maybe Jesse will try to be a father to an orphaned Brock in ""El Camino.""

Skyler and Walter Jr., a.k.a. Flynn (Anna Gunn and R.J. Mitte), again moved with baby Holly out of the family home in which so much of ""Breaking Bad"" took place. But Walter still found them in the finale. In a phone call the episode before, Walt Jr. had angrily asked his father to hurry up and die, so it's just as well he wasn't home. Almost unfazed by Walter's appearance, Skyler listened to what Walt Sr. had to say, arguably got some closure, learned where Hank's body was buried and then allowed him to say a final goodbye to his daughter. After leaving, Walter watched from afar as his son come home from school, unaware his father was seeing him for the final time.

Walter was just about to turn himself in when he saw Gretchen and Elliott on Charlie Rose, talking about how little the now-infamous drug kingpin had to do with their success. He tracked them down, dropping millions of dollars on them with instructions to form a trust fund for his family.

Six years ago, AMC's award-season juggernaut ""Breaking Bad"" came to a bloody and satisfying end, and with it the story of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), the high school science teacher who became an Albuquerque drug kingpin. AMC quickly spun off a prequel series, ""Better Call Saul,"" giving fans more time with characters like Saul Goodman, Mike Ehrmantraut and Gus Fring. But given that shift in focus -- and all the carnage of the final ""Breaking Bad"" season -- it was reasonable to think that the finale was the last word otherwise.

Then in late 2018, the series's creator, Vince Gilligan, secretly gathered his collaborators in New Mexico and directed his own screenplay for ""El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie,"" which comes to Netflix Friday. Judging by the trailer, the movie introduces a bunch of new characters and brings back a few familiar ones, the most important being Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), whom we last saw looking broken but alive, speeding off through the desert in ... an El Camino. But what about the rest? Remember Skinny Pete? And what about poor Flynn? It's been a while, so here's a refresher on where we left the characters who may still have some bearing on the sequel -- alive, dead or somewhere in between.

Economy,The Risks of Cheap Water,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/15/business/economy/the-price-of-water-is-too-low.html,"This summer, California's water authority declared that wasting water -- hosing a sidewalk, for example -- was a crime. Next door, in Nevada, Las Vegas has paid out $200 million over the last decade for homes and businesses to pull out their lawns. It will get worse. As climate change and population growth further stress the water supply from the drought-plagued West to the seemingly bottomless Great Lakes, states and municipalities are likely to impose increasingly draconian restrictions on water use. Such efforts may be more effective than simply exhorting people to conserve. In August, for example, cities and towns in California consumed much less water -- 27 billion gallons less --than in August last year. But the proliferation of limits on water use will not solve the problem because regulations do nothing to address the main driver of the nation's wanton consumption of water: its price.

""Most water problems are readily addressed with innovation,"" said David G. Victor of the University of California, San Diego. ""Getting the water price right to signal scarcity is crucially important."" The signals today are way off. Water is far too cheap across most American cities and towns. But what's worse is the way the United States quenches the thirst of farmers, who account for 80 percent of the nation's water consumption and for whom water costs virtually nothing. Adding to the challenges are the obstacles placed in the way of water trading. ""Markets are essential to ensuring that water, when it's scarce, can go to the most valuable uses,"" said Barton H. Thompson, an expert on environmental resources at Stanford Law School. Without them, ""the allocation of water is certainly arbitrary.""

""There is enough water; we can live within our means,"" said Jim Lochhead, chief executive of Denver Water. ""But the systems we have in place simply do not have enough flexibility to move water to the places where it is most needed."" The price of water going into Americans' homes often does not even cover the cost of delivering it, let alone the depreciation of utilities' infrastructure or their R&D. It certainly doesn't account for other costs imposed by water use -- on, say, fisheries or the environment -- caused by taking water out of rivers or lakes. Consumers have little incentive to conserve. Despite California's distress, about half of the homes in the capital, Sacramento, still don't have water meters, paying a flat fee no matter how much water they consume. Some utilities do worse: charging decreasing rates the more water is consumed. Utilities, of course, have little incentive to discourage consumption: The more they did that the more their revenues would decline. Rates have little relation to water's replacement cost. In Fresno, which gets less than 11 inches of rain a year, a family of four using 400 gallons a day faces a monthly water bill of $28.26. In Boston, where rainfall exceeds 40 inches, the same family would pay $77.73.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions. While this may seem a mess, it is nothing compared to the incentives facing American farms. Their water rights are primarily subject to state law. In the West, they have been allocated by a method that closely resembles ""first come first served."" The first farm that drew water had a right to whatever it needed pretty much forever. Junior users -- who arrived later -- had to stand in line.

This kind of arrangement helps explain why about half the 60 million acres of irrigated land in the United States use flood irrigation, just flooding the fields with water, which is about as wasteful a method as there is. It also helps explain why underground water reserves declined by 53 million acre-feet between 2003 and 2014, about twice the volume of Lake Mead. This is hardly the only obstacle to conservation. A farm that doesn't use its full allotment of water risks forfeiting it for not putting it to ""beneficial use."" And any water saved automatically flows to other farmers with junior rights. Farmers in many states are theoretically allowed to lease unused water. But the many holders of junior rights can block them. And they are legion: California has granted rights to five times its average annual flow of surface water. These restrictions have perverse consequences. San Diego, for instance, is building the nation's biggest desalination plant to produce fresh water at a cost of about $2,000 per acre-foot. But alfalfa growers in Southern California last year used hundreds of billions of gallons growing alfalfa that might fetch at best $340 a ton, or $920 per acre-foot of water. Markets, and sensible pricing structures, are good at resolving these problems. Some water districts, like Irvine Ranch in California, have successfully introduced rising fee schedules: starting low for a basic allotment covering families' essential needs and rising quickly with volume to make people think twice about refilling the swimming pool. Spurred by the sense of crisis, incipient water markets show great promise. Santa Fe, N.M., has required builders to have water rights with their building applications since 2005 -- giving farmers an opportunity to sell their rights to developers rather than using them for low-value crops.

In 2003, the San Diego Water Authority cut a deal with the Imperial Irrigation District -- a large area of parched farmland near California's Arizona border -- to provide the city with 200,000 acre-feet of water at a price starting at $258 per acre-foot. Seven states in the Colorado River system are starting a pilot program to explore a market between farmers and urban water authorities to help maintain water volumes in Lake Powell and Lake Mead. This isn't quite charging farmers for the water they use. But that may be a bridge too far, considering the tight margins of many farms and the political clout of many farmers. Still, markets such as those timidly emerging in the West could not only free water for the users who value it more, but they could also provide farmers with the revenue needed to invest in water management technology. None of this will come easily. People like cheap water and protest when rates rise. Farmers have resisted transfers of water to cities at least since California's water wars a century ago. The looming prospect of acute water scarcity demands a solution, however. It's not only the West's problem. Two years ago, the drought in the Midwest was as severe as the current drought in California. Lakes Michigan, Superior and Huron were at historic lows.",Higher prices are essential to induce conservation and investment in water-saving technology and to steer water to where it is valued most.,e6b48438-846d-53b5-af5b-f8d76ebb3a94,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/15/business/PORTER/PORTER-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=399&w=600&s=b32bc73f55362a62e141d6bb301bf8ce1b1a34a86f16c15c43e7e3239e7318d9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Lake Oroville in California in August.,e6b48438-846d-53b5-af5b-f8d76ebb3a94,Demo_data/D1_img2/1e6b48438-846d-53b5-af5b-f8d76ebb3a94.jpg,8,"The Risks of Cheap Water This summer, California's water authority declared that wasting water -- hosing a sidewalk, for example -- was a crime.

But alfalfa growers in Southern California last year used hundreds of billions of gallons growing alfalfa that might fetch at best $340 a ton, or $920 per acre-foot of water. Markets, and sensible pricing structures, are good at resolving these problems. Some water districts, like Irvine Ranch in California, have successfully introduced rising fee schedules: starting low for a basic allotment covering families' essential needs and rising quickly with volume to make people think twice about refilling the swimming pool. Spurred by the sense of crisis, incipient water markets show great promise. Santa Fe, N.M., has required builders to have water rights with their building applications since 2005 -- giving farmers an opportunity to sell their rights to developers rather than using them for low-value crops.

In 2003, the San Diego Water Authority cut a deal with the Imperial Irrigation District -- a large area of parched farmland near California's Arizona border -- to provide the city with 200,000 acre-feet of water at a price starting at $258 per acre-foot. Seven states in the Colorado River system are starting a pilot program to explore a market between farmers and urban water authorities to help maintain water volumes in Lake Powell and Lake Mead. This isn't quite charging farmers for the water they use. But that may be a bridge too far, considering the tight margins of many farms and the political clout of many farmers. Still, markets such as those timidly emerging in the West could not only free water for the users who value it more, but they could also provide farmers with the revenue needed to invest in water management technology. None of this will come easily. People like cheap water and protest when rates rise. Farmers have resisted transfers of water to cities at least since California's water wars a century ago. The looming prospect of acute water scarcity demands a solution, however. It's not only the West's problem. Two years ago, the drought in the Midwest was as severe as the current drought in California. Lakes Michigan, Superior and Huron were at historic lows. Higher prices are essential to induce conservation and investment in water-saving technology and to steer water to where it is valued most.",,"The Risks of Cheap Water This summer, California's water authority declared that wasting water -- hosing a sidewalk, for example -- was a crime. Next door, in Nevada, Las Vegas has paid out $200 million over the last decade for homes and businesses to pull out their lawns. It will get worse. As climate change and population growth further stress the water supply from the drought-plagued West to the seemingly bottomless Great Lakes, states and municipalities are likely to impose increasingly draconian restrictions on water use. Such efforts may be more effective than simply exhorting people to conserve. In August, for example, cities and towns in California consumed much less water -- 27 billion gallons less --than in August last year. But the proliferation of limits on water use will not solve the problem because regulations do nothing to address the main driver of the nation's wanton consumption of water: its price.

""Most water problems are readily addressed with innovation,"" said David G. Victor of the University of California, San Diego. ""Getting the water price right to signal scarcity is crucially important."" The signals today are way off. Water is far too cheap across most American cities and towns. But what's worse is the way the United States quenches the thirst of farmers, who account for 80 percent of the nation's water consumption and for whom water costs virtually nothing. Adding to the challenges are the obstacles placed in the way of water trading. ""Markets are essential to ensuring that water, when it's scarce, can go to the most valuable uses,"" said Barton H. Thompson, an expert on environmental resources at Stanford Law School. Without them, ""the allocation of water is certainly arbitrary.""

""There is enough water; we can live within our means,"" said Jim Lochhead, chief executive of Denver Water. ""But the systems we have in place simply do not have enough flexibility to move water to the places where it is most needed."" The price of water going into Americans' homes often does not even cover the cost of delivering it, let alone the depreciation of utilities' infrastructure or their R&D. It certainly doesn't account for other costs imposed by water use -- on, say, fisheries or the environment -- caused by taking water out of rivers or lakes. Consumers have little incentive to conserve. Despite California's distress, about half of the homes in the capital, Sacramento, still don't have water meters, paying a flat fee no matter how much water they consume. Some utilities do worse: charging decreasing rates the more water is consumed. Utilities, of course, have little incentive to discourage consumption: The more they did that the more their revenues would decline. Rates have little relation to water's replacement cost. In Fresno, which gets less than 11 inches of rain a year, a family of four using 400 gallons a day faces a monthly water bill of $28.26. In Boston, where rainfall exceeds 40 inches, the same family would pay $77.73.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions. While this may seem a mess, it is nothing compared to the incentives facing American farms. Their water rights are primarily subject to state law. In the West, they have been allocated by a method that closely resembles ""first come first served."" The first farm that drew water had a right to whatever it needed pretty much forever. Junior users -- who arrived later -- had to stand in line.

This kind of arrangement helps explain why about half the 60 million acres of irrigated land in the United States use flood irrigation, just flooding the fields with water, which is about as wasteful a method as there is. It also helps explain why underground water reserves declined by 53 million acre-feet between 2003 and 2014, about twice the volume of Lake Mead. This is hardly the only obstacle to conservation. A farm that doesn't use its full allotment of water risks forfeiting it for not putting it to ""beneficial use."" And any water saved automatically flows to other farmers with junior rights. Farmers in many states are theoretically allowed to lease unused water. But the many holders of junior rights can block them. And they are legion: California has granted rights to five times its average annual flow of surface water. These restrictions have perverse consequences. San Diego, for instance, is building the nation's biggest desalination plant to produce fresh water at a cost of about $2,000 per acre-foot.

Media,Clint Eastwood's 'Richard Jewell' Is at the Center of a Media Storm,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/business/media/richard-jewell-kathy-scruggs.html,"The director Clint Eastwood speaking to reporters at the Atlanta premiere of his new movie, ""Richard Jewell.""





ATLANTA -- Clint Eastwood received a standing ovation on Tuesday when he was introduced by the Georgia House speaker, David Ralston, for the red-carpet premiere of ""Richard Jewell"" at the Rialto Center for the Arts in downtown Atlanta. The audience broke into applause again at the climax of the fact-based film Mr. Eastwood directed about the security guard who was suspected by the F.B.I. of planting a bomb at the 1996 Summer Olympic Games. The reaction was a contrast to how the film was received Wednesday at a screening arranged by Cox Enterprises, the owner of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, at a theater near the newspaper's headquarters. During a scene in which a Journal-Constitution reporter is shown offering sex to an F.B.I. agent in exchange for information -- a scene the paper has called ""false and defamatory"" -- an audience member hissed. The film shows Kathy Scruggs, a law enforcement reporter, sidling up to the F.B.I. agent at a bar days after a pipe bomb packed with nails had exploded at Centennial Olympic Park in the city's downtown area, causing two deaths and injuring 111 people. ""Give me something I can print,"" says Ms. Scruggs, who is played by Olivia Wilde.

In most respects, ""Richard Jewell,"" based on a 1997 Vanity Fair article, ""American Nightmare,"" and a recently published nonfiction book, ""The Suspect,"" is faithful to the events it describes. But the scene in which Ms. Scruggs, who died in 2001 at age 42, trades sex for a scoop did not appear in either the article, by Marie Brenner, or the book, written by Kent Alexander, the United States attorney in Atlanta at the time of the bombing, and Kevin Salwen, a journalist who was based in Atlanta for The Wall Street Journal. As the movie shows, Mr. Jewell was indeed a suspect, and The Journal-Constitution reported that fact in a front-page article. After a CNN anchor read the story aloud on the air, other networks and newspapers joined the media herd. The suspect, who was never charged, spent his days holed up in his apartment as reporters staked him out, an ordeal that ended only when he was exonerated three months after the bombing.

In 2005, Eric Robert Rudolph, a serial bomber, confessed to the crime. Mr. Jewell died in 2007, a symbol for those who have faced trial by media during the 24-hour news cycles that came about when cable television was on the rise, a syndrome that prefigured the rushes to judgment of the social media era. Tom Johnson, who was the president of CNN at the time of the bombing, said the news media's handling of the story was regrettable. ""We were almost saying that he was guilty,"" he said in an interview. ""Nobody wrote that, but the unbelievable amount of coverage that was being given to Richard Jewell and the way in which all of us were trying to investigate it and report on it -- it was incredibly complex, but it was unsettling.""

Mr. Eastwood's film, written by the veteran screenwriter Billy Ray, follows the standard practice for movies based on real-life events by taking liberties with certain facts to speed the story along. But it uses Ms. Scruggs's real name while giving a new one to the F.B.I. agent, raising the question of whether the filmmakers risked damaging the reporter's reputation in their efforts to convey how Mr. Jewell lost his. This week, The Journal-Constitution sent a letter to Warner Bros. and the filmmakers, hinting at legal action for what it characterized as a defamatory depiction of Ms. Scruggs and an incomplete portrayal of how the paper arrived at the article naming Mr. Jewell as a suspect.

""For a film that purports to be about the besmirching of someone's reputation to proceed to smear Ms. Scruggs and the paper she reported for in this manner is highly offensive,"" said the letter, which was also signed by Cox Enterprises, the owner of the newspaper and one of the country's largest cable companies.

The article also said the film version of Ms. Scruggs ""veers from reality, according to people who knew and worked with her, in suggesting she landed scoops by offering to sleep with sources."" The film's bar scene has turned a cinematic examination of privacy, due process and the excesses of the news media into a target for critics who have called it the latest example of Hollywood's sexist take on women in journalism. The trope of female reporters sleeping with sources or story subjects has appeared in the HBO limited series ""Sharp Objects,"" the Netflix show ""House of Cards"" and the movie ""Thank You for Smoking,"" among other productions. Kelly McBride, a onetime police reporter who is the senior vice president of the Poynter Institute, a nonprofit organization that supports journalism, said the portrayal of Ms. Scruggs did not reflect reality. ""It is so exceedingly rare,"" she said. ""And yet this male-dominated world of Hollywood needs to cast female reporters as subject to the whims of nature."" ""I think Clint Eastwood is showing his age, frankly,"" she added of the 89-year-old director. Critics have noted that a film focused on a low point for law enforcement and the press was directed by a prominent conservative at a time when President Trump has vilified the F.B.I. as an arm of the so-called deep state and has repeatedly called the news media ""the enemy of the people.""

In the Vanity Fair article, Ms. Brenner wrote that an unnamed staff member at The Journal-Constitution referred to Ms. Scruggs as a ""police groupie."" But the article did not report that she had used sex to learn that Mr. Jewell was a suspect or had a sexual relationship with any F.B.I. agent on the case. Ms. Scruggs shared a byline for the July 1996 article naming Mr. Jewell as a suspect with Ron Martz. In an interview, Mr. Martz, who spent 26 years at the paper before leaving in 2007, said that he had not been contacted by anybody working on the film and that its portrayal of his colleague was false. ""She could be flirtatious, but she wouldn't have done that sort of thing, because she was very conscious of her role as a reporter and she wanted to be known as a top-notch reporter,"" he said. He added, ""That sort of portrayal of her, it's an insult not only to her, but to just about any other woman who's been a reporter.""

The reaction was a contrast to how the film was received Wednesday at a screening arranged by Cox Enterprises, the owner of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, at a theater near the newspaper's headquarters. During a scene in which a Journal-Constitution reporter is shown offering sex to an F.B.I. agent in exchange for information -- a scene the paper has called ""false and defamatory"" -- an audience member hissed. The film shows Kathy Scruggs, a law enforcement reporter, sidling up to the F.B.I. agent at a bar days after a pipe bomb packed with nails had exploded at Centennial Olympic Park in the city's downtown area, causing two deaths and injuring 111 people. ""Give me something I can print,"" says Ms. Scruggs, who is played by Olivia Wilde.

In most respects, ""Richard Jewell,"" based on a 1997 Vanity Fair article, ""American Nightmare,"" and a recently published nonfiction book, ""The Suspect,"" is faithful to the events it describes. But the scene in which Ms. Scruggs, who died in 2001 at age 42, trades sex for a scoop did not appear in either the article, by Marie Brenner, or the book, written by Kent Alexander, the United States attorney in Atlanta at the time of the bombing, and Kevin Salwen, a journalist who was based in Atlanta for The Wall Street Journal. As the movie shows, Mr. Jewell was indeed a suspect, and The Journal-Constitution reported that fact in a front-page article. After a CNN anchor read the story aloud on the air, other networks and newspapers joined the media herd. The suspect, who was never charged, spent his days holed up in his apartment as reporters staked him out, an ordeal that ended only when he was exonerated three months after the bombing.

In 2005, Eric Robert Rudolph, a serial bomber, confessed to the crime. Mr. Jewell died in 2007, a symbol for those who have faced trial by media during the 24-hour news cycles that came about when cable television was on the rise, a syndrome that prefigured the rushes to judgment of the social media era. Tom Johnson, who was the president of CNN at the time of the bombing, said the news media's handling of the story was regrettable. ""We were almost saying that he was guilty,"" he said in an interview. ""Nobody wrote that, but the unbelievable amount of coverage that was being given to Richard Jewell and the way in which all of us were trying to investigate it and report on it -- it was incredibly complex, but it was unsettling.""

Mr. Eastwood's film, written by the veteran screenwriter Billy Ray, follows the standard practice for movies based on real-life events by taking liberties with certain facts to speed the story along. But it uses Ms. Scruggs's real name while giving a new one to the F.B.I. agent, raising the question of whether the filmmakers risked damaging the reporter's reputation in their efforts to convey how Mr. Jewell lost his. This week, The Journal-Constitution sent a letter to Warner Bros. and the filmmakers, hinting at legal action for what it characterized as a defamatory depiction of Ms. Scruggs and an incomplete portrayal of how the paper arrived at the article naming Mr. Jewell as a suspect.

""For a film that purports to be about the besmirching of someone's reputation to proceed to smear Ms. Scruggs and the paper she reported for in this manner is highly offensive,"" said the letter, which was also signed by Cox Enterprises, the owner of the newspaper and one of the country's largest cable companies. Cox hired the litigator Martin D. Singer, known for his work on behalf of celebrities like Charlie Sheen and Bill Cosby, to represent the paper.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Warner Bros. fired back with a statement that said, ""It is unfortunate and the ultimate irony that The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, having been a part of the rush to judgment of Richard Jewell, is now trying to malign our filmmakers and cast."" Weeks before the film's release, The Journal-Constitution published an article headlined ""The Ballad of Kathy Scruggs."" It described a ""hard-charging"" police reporter who used ""salty language,"" wore ""short skirts"" and did not leave crime scenes ""until her notebook was full."" The article also said the film version of Ms. Scruggs ""veers from reality, according to people who knew and worked with her, in suggesting she landed scoops by offering to sleep with sources."" The film's bar scene has turned a cinematic examination of privacy, due process and the excesses of the news media into a target for critics who have called it the latest example of Hollywood's sexist take on women in journalism. The trope of female reporters sleeping with sources or story subjects has appeared in the HBO limited series ""Sharp Objects,"" the Netflix show ""House of Cards"" and the movie ""Thank You for Smoking,"" among other productions. Kelly McBride, a onetime police reporter who is the senior vice president of the Poynter Institute, a nonprofit organization that supports journalism, said the portrayal of Ms. Scruggs did not reflect reality. ""It is so exceedingly rare,"" she said. ""And yet this male-dominated world of Hollywood needs to cast female reporters as subject to the whims of nature."" ""I think Clint Eastwood is showing his age, frankly,"" she added of the 89-year-old director. Critics have noted that a film focused on a low point for law enforcement and the press was directed by a prominent conservative at a time when President Trump has vilified the F.B.I. as an arm of the so-called deep state and has repeatedly called the news media ""the enemy of the people.""

In the Vanity Fair article, Ms. Brenner wrote that an unnamed staff member at The Journal-Constitution referred to Ms. Scruggs as a ""police groupie."" But the article did not report that she had used sex to learn that Mr. Jewell was a suspect or had a sexual relationship with any F.B.I. agent on the case. Ms. Scruggs shared a byline for the July 1996 article naming Mr. Jewell as a suspect with Ron Martz. In an interview, Mr. Martz, who spent 26 years at the paper before leaving in 2007, said that he had not been contacted by anybody working on the film and that its portrayal of his colleague was false. ""She could be flirtatious, but she wouldn't have done that sort of thing, because she was very conscious of her role as a reporter and she wanted to be known as a top-notch reporter,"" he said. He added, ""That sort of portrayal of her, it's an insult not only to her, but to just about any other woman who's been a reporter.""

The discussion also went into the question of whether the newspaper had been right, in the weeks after the bombing, to report that Mr. Jewell was the leading suspect and to describe him as someone who ""fits the profile of the lone bomber."" (A libel lawsuit filed against the newspaper was dismissed in 2007.) ""I think it's worth addressing the broader criticism, regardless of what the movie got right or wrong,"" Meris Lutz, a reporter at the paper, said. Of the bar scene, she added: ""It felt so unnecessary. If they had cut that, I don't think it would have affected the movie at all."" The film shows the journalist Kathy Scruggs trading sex for a scoop. ""It's an insult not only to her, but to just about any other woman who's been a reporter,"" says her writing partner.",16,['16'],16

And though the story of ""Kid Victory"" begins after Luke has been rescued from what turns out to have been a year of drugged captivity in thrall to a deranged former history teacher, he never really leaves the dungeon he once called home, not in his mind. Clint Ramos's single set keeps that mattress, and those handcuffs, in full view of the audience throughout this small, uneasily assembled production, which is directed by Liesl Tommy.

Mr. Kander, it seems safe to say, is not afraid of the dark. The settings for his earlier works -- mostly created in tandem with his longtime partner, the lyricist Fred Ebb, who died in 2004 -- have included a Nazi-infested Berlin nightclub (""Cabaret""), a cellblock for Jazz Age murderesses (""Chicago"") and a dying European town held economic hostage by a rich, vengeful and macabre woman scorned (""The Visit""). Even given such a rich history of singing in the shadows, the subject of ""Kid Victory"" feels especially unpromising for any musical that doesn't aspire to grim, grand (guignol) opera or creepy camp. And this latest teaming of Mr. Kander and Mr. Pierce (who previously collaborated on ""The Landing"") definitely has other aspirations, toward a laudable but elusive psychology delicacy.

You can imagine the artfully brooding songs that such a boy might give voice to, especially from a past master of musical neuroses like Mr. Kander. Yet Mr. Flynn is the only one of the show's nine ensemble members who never sings a note. Presumably, this silence is to suggest that Luke has been stripped of his identity and hence his own song. And it would seem that the melodies that percolate throughout the show -- often as underscoring or sung fragments as opposed to full numbers -- are meant to summon the world as Luke hears it, a social choir of sorts in which he cannot participate. This perspective comes across best in hymns performed by members of the church to which Luke's parents belong, in which tunes of sweet uplift are tugged by an ominous undertow. But Mr. Kander mines a number of musical veins, including the jaunty jazz and vaudeville pastiches for which he is best known, with results that are scattered, a bit bewilderingly, among the characters. Similarly confusing is the use of the supporting cast to shift, in a single song, between whomever they're playing and the accusing voices of recrimination in Luke's head.

Music,"His Music Full of Echoes, a Maverick Composer Turns 90",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/arts/music/george-crumb-90th-birthday.html,"MEDIA, Penn. -- The sounds that filter into George Crumb's composition studio here are a typically suburban mix of placid and suddenly brash. The occasional car skulks by on the leafy street outside. Visitors are greeted by vociferous barking from one of the shelter dogs rescued by Mr. Crumb and his wife of 70 years, Elizabeth. She keeps the radio on the classical music station most of the day, while their youngest son, Peter, who lives with them, blasts country in his bedroom upstairs. The music Mr. Crumb has dreamed up in this home studio, a converted garage, over the decades is often peaceful and jolting, like his sonic environment. But his compositions unfold in another world that is dreamlike and sometimes nightmarish.

He continues to compose here even as he approaches his 90th birthday, coming in October. On Sunday and Tuesday, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center gets in early on the celebration, presenting a two-concert tribute to Mr. Crumb at Alice Tully Hall. Included is the premiere of a new piece for percussion ensemble, as well as some of the classic works that have made him one of the most recognizable and beloved voices in contemporary music.

Among them are ""Vox Balaenae,"" which draws whale-like sounds from a flute, and the Vietnam War-haunted ""Black Angels"" for amplified string quartet, which one critic called ""a work of frightening intensity, where Jimi Hendrix and Pierrot Lunaire shake hands with the devil."" In ""Music for a Summer Evening,"" for two pianos and percussion, the musicians become celebrants in a mesmerizing ritual that requires the pianists to reach deep into the instrument's strings. The pianist Gilbert Kalish, who has long championed this music and will perform in both concerts, spoke in an interview about Mr. Crumb's expansion of the piano's color palette through novel techniques. ""It's like a new instrument he's invented,"" he said. ""And it's really wild.""

Mr. Crumb's compositions inhabit a strange kind of suburbia themselves, a liminal space, rooted in the canon of Western music but venturing out into the world of natural sounds and acoustic phenomena. Echoes abound, whether from the careful manipulation of overtones and resonances or through the discreet halo created by metallic percussion. Mr. Crumb, who grew up in Charleston, W.Va., with the sound of a rushing river ricocheting off the surrounding hills, said early sound memories might have found a way into his music.

""There were echoes constantly,"" he said on a recent afternoon in his studio, as he sat in an office chair that allowed him to scoot back and forth between a desk piled high with scores and a piano in need of tuning. ""I do think that composers inherit a kind of acoustic."" Fragments from other composers float through his works and settle in strange places. ""Vox Balaenae"" references the optimistic ascending brass fanfare of Strauss's ""Also Sprach Zarathustra,"" but in so spectral a manner that it seems like a trick of the listener's imagination. For much of Mr. Crumb's career, such quotations were anathema to the reigning modernist ethos. But the battles that raged in the middle of the 20th century between warring aesthetic movements seem to have passed him by. Asked whether he was ever criticized for writing tonal pieces or quoting Chopin, Mr. Crumb replied innocently. ""No, I don't recall anything like that,"" he said as his face creased into a smile. ""Maybe they spoke about it, and I didn't hear them."" While much of the respected music in those days was intellectual and a bit airless, ""George was a maverick,"" Mr. Kalish said. ""His music was so appealing and emotional."" That's not to say Mr. Crumb makes it easy for performers. His scores are known to delight and terrify musicians in equal measure. The hand-drawn staves on his manuscripts sometimes curve into circles or break up into islands in a sea of white paper.

At the same time, she added, ""it also leaves some of the magic and creativity up to the performer."" Folded into the elegant design are countless instructions, both exacting and poetic. Some of them read more like stage directions than expressive markings: Under the title ""An Idyll for the Misbegotten,"" a work for flute and drums, Mr. Crumb wrote ""to be heard from afar, over a lake, on a moonlit evening in August."" ""It puts the performer into that space,"" Ms. O'Connor said. ""Now I have a temperature; there's insects and bugs; and there's a thunderstorm brewing."" The music becomes an organic process: ""It's based in nature."" For Mr. Crumb, the process of designing his manuscripts and drawing each stave by hand is painstaking, but he wouldn't have it any other way. ""I just don't like computer notation,"" he said. ""It all looks alike."" His works are loved by performers and audiences to a degree that few other living composers can match. Mr. Crumb counts over 20 recordings of his piano cycle ""Makrokosmos"" alone.

George Crumb's otherworldly, poetic, sometimes nightmarish sounds will be celebrated in two concerts by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center.",,"His Music Full of Echoes, a Maverick Composer Turns 90 MEDIA, Penn. -- The sounds that filter into George Crumb's composition studio here are a typically suburban mix of placid and suddenly brash. The occasional car skulks by on the leafy street outside. Visitors are greeted by vociferous barking from one of the shelter dogs rescued by Mr. Crumb and his wife of 70 years, Elizabeth. She keeps the radio on the classical music station most of the day, while their youngest son, Peter, who lives with them, blasts country in his bedroom upstairs. The music Mr. Crumb has dreamed up in this home studio, a converted garage, over the decades is often peaceful and jolting, like his sonic environment. But his compositions unfold in another world that is dreamlike and sometimes nightmarish.

He continues to compose here even as he approaches his 90th birthday, coming in October. On Sunday and Tuesday, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center gets in early on the celebration, presenting a two-concert tribute to Mr. Crumb at Alice Tully Hall. Included is the premiere of a new piece for percussion ensemble, as well as some of the classic works that have made him one of the most recognizable and beloved voices in contemporary music.

Among them are ""Vox Balaenae,"" which draws whale-like sounds from a flute, and the Vietnam War-haunted ""Black Angels"" for amplified string quartet, which one critic called ""a work of frightening intensity, where Jimi Hendrix and Pierrot Lunaire shake hands with the devil."" In ""Music for a Summer Evening,"" for two pianos and percussion, the musicians become celebrants in a mesmerizing ritual that requires the pianists to reach deep into the instrument's strings. The pianist Gilbert Kalish, who has long championed this music and will perform in both concerts, spoke in an interview about Mr. Crumb's expansion of the piano's color palette through novel techniques. ""It's like a new instrument he's invented,"" he said. ""And it's really wild.""

Mr. Crumb's compositions inhabit a strange kind of suburbia themselves, a liminal space, rooted in the canon of Western music but venturing out into the world of natural sounds and acoustic phenomena. Echoes abound, whether from the careful manipulation of overtones and resonances or through the discreet halo created by metallic percussion. Mr. Crumb, who grew up in Charleston, W.Va., with the sound of a rushing river ricocheting off the surrounding hills, said early sound memories might have found a way into his music.

""There were echoes constantly,"" he said on a recent afternoon in his studio, as he sat in an office chair that allowed him to scoot back and forth between a desk piled high with scores and a piano in need of tuning. ""I do think that composers inherit a kind of acoustic."" Fragments from other composers float through his works and settle in strange places. ""Vox Balaenae"" references the optimistic ascending brass fanfare of Strauss's ""Also Sprach Zarathustra,"" but in so spectral a manner that it seems like a trick of the listener's imagination. For much of Mr. Crumb's career, such quotations were anathema to the reigning modernist ethos. But the battles that raged in the middle of the 20th century between warring aesthetic movements seem to have passed him by. Asked whether he was ever criticized for writing tonal pieces or quoting Chopin, Mr. Crumb replied innocently. ""No, I don't recall anything like that,"" he said as his face creased into a smile. ""Maybe they spoke about it, and I didn't hear them."" While much of the respected music in those days was intellectual and a bit airless, ""George was a maverick,"" Mr. Kalish said. ""His music was so appealing and emotional."" That's not to say Mr. Crumb makes it easy for performers. His scores are known to delight and terrify musicians in equal measure. The hand-drawn staves on his manuscripts sometimes curve into circles or break up into islands in a sea of white paper.

At the same time, she added, ""it also leaves some of the magic and creativity up to the performer."" Folded into the elegant design are countless instructions, both exacting and poetic. Some of them read more like stage directions than expressive markings: Under the title ""An Idyll for the Misbegotten,"" a work for flute and drums, Mr. Crumb wrote ""to be heard from afar, over a lake, on a moonlit evening in August."" ""It puts the performer into that space,"" Ms. O'Connor said. ""Now I have a temperature; there's insects and bugs; and there's a thunderstorm brewing."" The music becomes an organic process: ""It's based in nature."" For Mr. Crumb, the process of designing his manuscripts and drawing each stave by hand is painstaking, but he wouldn't have it any other way. ""I just don't like computer notation,"" he said. ""It all looks alike."" His works are loved by performers and audiences to a degree that few other living composers can match.

Style,If Only Everyone Had a Postpartum Doula,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/style/postpartum-doula.html,"New parenthood -- during which ordinary people find themselves abruptly responsible for a brand-new and sometimes famished, inconsolable being -- is famously harrowing. It's good to have supportive family and friends during this time. But increasingly, parents are turning to postpartum doulas, as well. Unlike birth doulas, who assist mothers during pregnancy and childbirth, postpartum doulas step in when the baby is already born, and throughout the first six weeks after birth. They teach the supposedly natural but actually quite difficult to master skills of soothing, bathing and breast-feeding infants, without any personal baggage. [The topics parents are talking about. Sign up now to get NYT Parenting in your inbox every week.] There is no one agency that certifies all postpartum doulas, but between 2012 and 2017, DONA International, the oldest doula certification program in the country originally known as the Doulas of North America, accredited 37 percent more postpartum practitioners. The number of certified postpartum doulas at the Childbirth and Postpartum Professional Association (CAPPA), another well-established program, has doubled since 2008.

Meema Spadola was certified by DONA in 2006 and practices in the New York City area. With cropped black hair and pink-framed glasses, Ms. Spadola, 48, is a modern Mary Poppins: a combination friend, teacher and spirit guide with a price tag of $50 to $70 an hour. One sunlit afternoon, she mounted the red brick steps of a new client's house in Brooklyn, armed with a stretch of black fabric for ""babywearing"" (like a sling for your infant) and a recipe for high-protein nursing snacks affectionately known as ""boobie bites."" The client, Shannon Gillen Lipinski, a 37-year-old choreographer, had become a mother just 8 days earlier.

Upon entrance, it became clear that Ms. Gillen Lipinski's home had been recently transformed. A tarp taped over the front window blocked the day's bright light. Empty plastic pumping bottles were waiting to be filled; a giant gray birthing ball rolled aimlessly; and the closet was stuffed with tiny onesies covered in bunnies, strawberries and polka dots. The eight-day-old at the heart of it all, Sasha, was mercifully sleeping, wrapped against Ms. Spadola's chest, but everyone knew the peace was tenuous. And too soon it was time for Ms. Spadola to teach Ms. Gillen Lipinski swaddling, which meant she had to risk waking the baby and eliciting cries.

""This is so scary,"" Ms. Gillen Lipinski said, her voice breaking. ""We're being very daring,"" Ms. Spadola said, laying out a pink blanket inside the crib. Ms. Gillen Lipinski had committed to choreographing a show in Los Angeles that started in several weeks. With the rehearsal deadline looming -- and Sasha prone to crying through the night -- Ms. Gillen Lipinski was exhausted. She was trying to learn how to breast-feed and pump milk and calm her infant when she herself was in a panic, but nothing seemed to be going smoothly. ""We always thought we'd have two,"" said Ms. Gillen Lipinski. But, she said, perhaps swayed by the three hours of sleep she got the night before, ""we just completed our family."" ""It will not always be like this,"" Ms. Spadola reassured her, expertly folding the pink blanket over itself to create a tight cocoon around Sasha, while simultaneously patting the baby's chest and firmly whispering ""Shh."" Sasha opened her eyes, yawned and squirmed.

Medical providers and policymakers have already recognized that birth doulas improve such health outcomes. Two states, Minnesota and Oregon, now include birth doula services in their Medicaid coverage, and in the spring of this year, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced a pilot program to expand Medicaid coverage for doulas in New York. The idea of hiring such doulas has gotten a lot more mainstream. Still, even as postpartum doulas multiply, the care they provide remains largely unsubsidized and expensive. (The majority of Ms. Spadola's clients are white, upper middle class and can pay out of pocket, though she does offer a sliding scale.) And though the care aims to be non-judgmental, it often comes along with white, middle-class assumptions about parenting, said Christine Morton, the author of the book ""Birth Ambassadors,"" which chronicles the rise of doulas in the United States. Some birth activists and nonprofits are working to change that, and to make postpartum doula care more democratic and widespread. Ancient Song Doula Services in Brooklyn, a low-cost doula collective for women who couldn't otherwise afford one, is one such place. The majority of the organization's clients are women of color, and more than half of the doulas are low-income themselves, volunteering to help other women through labor and after birth. The collective is fighting abysmal maternal mortality rates among black and brown women, in addition to well-founded fears among women of color, said Chanel Porchia-Albert, its founder. ""A lot of times women of color won't express what they're going through, or seek out help, because they don't want to be criminalized for the choices they make,"" Ms. Porchia-Albert said, adding that a black woman might fear losing custody of her children if she admits to being overwhelmed or exhausted. One client, Aisha Crawford, 33, wanted to be prepared for anything that might come up when she gave birth, so, six months pregnant, she arrived at Ancient Song to get matched with a postpartum doula free-of-charge. She took a seat in the intake room, a comfortable space outfitted with yoga pillows and a baby crib, and explained her situation to the intake coordinator. She and the father of the baby had a fine relationship, and she wanted him to be involved when the baby arrived. But she wasn't sure she could depend on him. ""I don't want to say I'm scared to have the baby by myself, but just in case, I need someone there with me,"" Ms. Crawford said.

Like other workers who provide intimate care, postpartum doulas become experts at navigating the delicate and the unsaid: a pregnant woman's hopes, family expectations, nerves and the relationship between a baby's parents. They are advocates for their clients not just to doctors and nurses, but also to family members, who have their own ideas about how things should be done. Ms. Crawford said her parents were initially wary of her pregnancy, because she was still legally married to a different man, who would not sign divorce papers. Berenice Kernizan, Ancient Song's intake coordinator, nodded empathetically. ""I'm sure as soon as the baby comes, they're going to forget all about that,"" she said. ""The way they nag you is the way they show you that they love you."" Shifting on the couch, Ms. Crawford said she was a little nervous about much of what lay ahead: the months of pregnancy, the hours of labor, and, perhaps most daunting of all, the day the baby would come home with her, delicate and perfect and in need of so much.

Technology,"Apple Rejects Facebook's Gaming App, for at Least the Fifth Time",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/technology/apple-ios-facebook-gaming-app.html,"Executives and engineers from Facebook's games division submitted their new app, Facebook Gaming, to Apple last month for approval to offer it in the iPhone maker's App Store. Apple considered Facebook's application for a few weeks. This month, it delivered its verdict: denied. The Facebook team was not surprised. It wasn't the first time Apple had said no to the Facebook Gaming app. Or the second. Or even the third. Since February, Apple has rejected at least five versions of Facebook Gaming, according to three people with knowledge of the companies, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the details are confidential. Each time, the people said, Apple cited its rules that prohibit apps with the ""main purpose"" of distributing casual games.

Facebook Gaming may also have been hurt by appearing to compete with Apple's own sales of games, two of the people said. Games are by far the most lucrative category of mobile apps worldwide. Apple's App Store, the only officially approved place for iPhone and iPad users to find new games and other programs, generated about $15 billion in revenue last year. Apple's rejections of the app from Facebook, a fellow Silicon Valley powerhouse, illustrate the control it exerts over the mobile software and entertainment ecosystem -- clout that regulators are increasingly examining. On Tuesday, the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, said it had opened a formal antitrust investigation into Apple to determine if the terms that the company imposes on app developers violate competition rules. ""We need to ensure that Apple's rules do not distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers,"" said Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission executive vice president in charge of competition policy. This week, Basecamp publicly complained that its new email app, Hey, had been denied from the App Store because it charged customers outside Apple's payment system, keeping the giant company from collecting its 30 percent cut. ""We keep trying to find logic, consistency in Apple's App Store decisions,"" David Hansson, Basecamp's co-founder and chief technology officer, wrote on Twitter. ""The answer is much more basic: power. Apple can do what they want, when they want, so they do.""

Apple, which will hold its annual developer conference next week, said the App Store has many apps that offer casual games and that follow its rules, including the main Facebook app. Facebook said it would release Facebook Gaming when Apple approved it. Apple has long taken a ""walled garden"" approach to its mobile devices while its main mobile competitor, Google and its Android operating system, has adopted a more laissez-faire philosophy. Both companies take 30 percent of most purchases on their app stores, leaving 70 percent to app developers. ""Apple and Google Play have always pursued different strategies for their app stores, which align with the closed ecosystem -- Apple -- versus open ecosystem -- Google -- company attributes,"" said Candice Mudrick, head of market analysis at Newzoo, a game industry research firm. Apple has said it monitors its App Store ecosystem closely to ensure the highest standards of quality and security. According to its App Store principles: ""When you download an app, it should work as promised. We carefully review each app and require developers to follow strict guidelines on privacy, design and business models."" But over time, that has increasingly grated on some app developers. The European Union investigation into Apple was spurred by a complaint last year from Spotify, whose music-streaming service competes with Apple Music. Spotify and others have criticized Apple for charging a fee of up to 30 percent on digital services sold through its App Store, arguing that it amounts to a tax that violates competition laws.

Facebook announced its Gaming app in April as people were sheltering in place from the coronavirus pandemic and playing more video games. For the social network, the new app was a way to more deeply engage its users. The free app has three main components: watching live streams of other people playing games; socially networking with other gamers; and playing simple games like Words With Friends and Thug Life. On both Apple and Android devices, those simple games can be delivered within Facebook Gaming's app using software called HTML5.

Google quickly approved Facebook Gaming for its Google Play app store and began offering the app worldwide on April 20. In the Android version of Facebook Gaming, a catalog of simple games is presented by category and with colorful icons. Some of those games allow players to spend real money for in-game purchases. Facebook initially submitted its Gaming app to Apple for approval in late February, said the people with knowledge of the situation. Apple rejected that version, they said, citing Section 4.7 of its app rules, which state that HTML5 games are allowed ""as long as code distribution isn't the main purpose of the app"" and ""the code is not offered in a store or store-like interface,"" among other restrictions. But the initial version of the Gaming app that Facebook showed to Apple was similar to the Android version, listing games by category in a manner that could be interpreted as ""store-like."" Trying to get the Gaming app through Apple's review process, Facebook then changed the design of the presentation of games in several ways, the people said. The colorful icons were removed in favor of a bland listing. The different games categories were removed to list all games at once. The ability to sort games was also taken away.","Apple has repeatedly denied Facebook's new Gaming app from appearing in its App Store, citing its own rules.",3f7d31a5-c434-5d1c-8c24-4e210ee1d46a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/18/business/18facebookgaming1/merlin_139482288_e3c9cba0-906b-4d18-85ba-b823f97549b6-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c30c96083a888b5040456b4ee14ef97139eee113f749ebfd41389e3dcf5f7a44&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Facebook introduced its Facebook Gaming mobile app in April.,3f7d31a5-c434-5d1c-8c24-4e210ee1d46a,Demo_data/D1_img2/13f7d31a5-c434-5d1c-8c24-4e210ee1d46a.jpg,20,"Apple Rejects Facebook's Gaming App, for at Least the Fifth Time Executives and engineers from Facebook's games division submitted their new app, Facebook Gaming, to Apple last month for approval to offer it in the iPhone maker's App Store.

It wasn't the first time Apple had said no to the Facebook Gaming app. Or the second. Or even the third.

Facebook Gaming may also have been hurt by appearing to compete with Apple's own sales of games, two of the people said. Games are by far the most lucrative category of mobile apps worldwide. Apple's App Store, the only officially approved place for iPhone and iPad users to find new games and other programs, generated about $15 billion in revenue last year. Apple's rejections of the app from Facebook, a fellow Silicon Valley powerhouse, illustrate the control it exerts over the mobile software and entertainment ecosystem -- clout that regulators are increasingly examining.

""We need to ensure that Apple's rules do not distort competition in markets where Apple is competing with other app developers,"" said Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission executive vice president in charge of competition policy. This week, Basecamp publicly complained that its new email app, Hey, had been denied from the App Store because it charged customers outside Apple's payment system, keeping the giant company from collecting its 30 percent cut.

Science,Chickens Agree: Left Means Less; Right Means More,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/30/science/left-means-less-even-for-chickens.html,"Asked to picture the numbers from one to 10, most people will imagine a straight line with one at the left end and 10 at the right. This ""mental number line,"" as researchers have termed it, is so pervasive that some scientists have argued that the spatial representation of numbers is hard-wired into the brain, part of a primitive number system that underlies humans' capacity for higher mathematics. Now a team of Italian researchers has found that newborn chicks, like humans, appear to map numbers spatially, associating smaller amounts with the left side and larger amounts with the right side.

The chicks, trained to seek out mealworms behind white plastic panels printed with varying numbers of identical red squares, repeatedly demonstrated a preference for the left when the number of squares was small and for the right when the number was larger. The research, led by Rosa Rugani, a psychologist who at the time was at the University of Padova, will appear in Friday's issue of the journal Science.

In their report, the researchers said the findings supported the idea that the left-right orientation for numbers is innate rather than determined by culture or education -- a possibility that was raised by some studies that found that in Arabic-speaking countries where letters and numbers are read right to left, the mental number scale was reversed. But the new research, Dr. Rugani and her colleagues wrote, indicates that orienting numbers in space may represent ""a universal cognitive strategy available soon after birth."" Tyler Marghetis, a doctoral candidate in psychology at the University of California, San Diego, who has published research on the spatial association of numbers, called the researcher's studies ""very cool."" ""We have brains that evolved for fighting and finding food, not for doing calculus,"" Mr. Marghetis said. ""So one of the hopes of this kind of research is that it will tell us something about the basic building blocks we have access to in building up these more human concepts."" But Mr. Marghetis said that the studies demonstrated only that the chicks associated rough quantities that were smaller or larger with left or right, not that they represented precise numbers in a mental line. And he cautioned against leaping from the study's findings to the idea that chicks are capable of the same complex numerical abilities as humans.

Judging amounts, either of how much food is available or how many predators are nearby, is an important tool for survival. And many nonhuman species -- including chickens, pigeons, monkeys and even some species of fish -- have some ability to count, though this may be a capacity to distinguish rough numerical magnitude rather than precise numbers.

Human studies indicate that when presented with a task involving numbers -- categorizing them as even or odd, for example -- people automatically create a mental scale, using one number as an anchor and locating smaller numbers to the left and larger ones to the right. The findings of the new research suggest that some version of this may be true for chickens. The scientists trained 64 chicks to find a mealworm behind a plastic panel with five red squares on it (16 chicks were disqualified after showing ""poor mealworm-following behavior,"" the researchers wrote). The chicks were then presented with panels, one to the left, one to the right, each marked with an equal number of squares, different from the training number. When that new number was less than five, the chicks more often chose to look for food behind the left-hand panel, presumably because they automatically associated the left-hand side with a smaller number. When the number of squares on the new panels was larger than five, the chicks more often headed toward the panel on the right. The chicks preference for the left-hand panel with smaller numbers held true even when the anchor number was changed to 20. Like humans, they seemed to adjust their choices to the relative magnitude of the numbers they encountered. ""We cannot think of any other, and simpler, explanation for the behavior of the chicks than assuming the training number is 1) remembered and 2) compared with the number seen at test,"" Dr. Rugani said in an email.","Scientists found that newborn chicks, like people, seem to map numbers spatially, associating smaller amounts with the left and larger ones with the right.",bd645e94-ec28-5adf-baf2-6e1300eb085d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/30/science/30chickens/30chickens-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=45e7cee12001f8f130314dfa5974bb72e27d937cec91b90426f2999a35a63225&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A study suggests that newborn chicks map numbers spatially, associating low numerical values with space to their left.",bd645e94-ec28-5adf-baf2-6e1300eb085d,Demo_data/D1_img2/1bd645e94-ec28-5adf-baf2-6e1300eb085d.jpg,2,"Chickens Agree: Left Means Less; Right Means More Asked to picture the numbers from one to 10, most people will imagine a straight line with one at the left end and 10 at the right.

Fashion & Style,The Top 10 Moments of Paris Fashion Week,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/fashion/top-10-moments-paris-fashion-week.html,"Gifts are often left on front row seats at fashion shows for guests. Rarely, however, are they placed on every seat. And they are never black hooded plastic rain ponchos, with the name of a designer across the back. Such was the case at Rick Owens on Thursday evening. For his eerie, water-soaked show at the Palais du Tokyo, overlooking the banks of the Seine, models dressed in strange silhouettes that resembled alien cocoons and took a trip through fountain mists. The seated audience, bedecked in their ponchos, looked like they were taking a different kind of ride: a high fashion log flume, perhaps, as they were showered from on high. Five days later, inside the Grand Palais, the elements emerged again, this time at Chanel. Karl Lagerfeld had commissioned a giant replica of the Verdon Gorge in the south of France, which took two months to construct and had six waterfalls, all rushing into a gully below the catwalk. The aquatic theme then continued with the collection, a playful 89-look procession of vinyl rain gear. But even imported Mother Nature can have her unpredictable way; half a dozen hats were blown off models' heads by the sheer force of the cascades. Nevertheless, waterproofing has rarely looked so chic. -- ELIZABETH PATON, European correspondent, Styles

Saint Laurent Had the Venue to End All Venues A brand's power and success can often be revealed in its choice of space, and Saint Laurent was a case in point. The French brand, now designed by Anthony Vaccarello, opened up Paris Fashion Week in the most beautiful place imaginable: at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. Showgoers sat on a set at the base of the Trocadero, and as models emerged, the Eiffel Tower glittered as if on cue. With such an impressive backdrop, the fashion needed to be powerful, and it was. For the show's finale, couture-like feather and leather gowns came down the runway, one more beautiful than the next. -- MALINA JOSEPH GILCHRIST, style director, women's, T magazine

In a season in which casting directors appeared at last to be inching toward diversity and inclusivity on the runway -- with leaps and bounds still to go -- I was most struck by the omnipresence of the beautiful redhead Teddy Quinlivan. She's been a familiar face for several seasons, but during this one, midway during New York Fashion Week, she came out as transgender. And in a rare cheering moment, the reaction was first celebratory (it was a brave revelation) and then resolutely normal. Then she resumed her career without incident and swept the shows in Paris -- Dior, Dries, Margiela, Chloe, Paco Rabanne, Haider Ackermann, Sacai, Miu Miu, Louis Vuitton -- not as a token or an example, just another woman with a great look and sixth sense about how to mow down a catwalk. Sometimes, progress comes with a shout. Other times, no less worthy, with a shrug. -- MATTHEW SCHNEIER, deputy fashion critic and reporter, Styles

There Were Some Particularly Special Sites One of the characteristics of shows in Paris is the way they exploit (and reveal) fashion's relationship to the city. Designers here don't opt for soulless white boxes but instead race to outdo each other in access to the coolest, rarest, most insider venues. This season, there were shows in the Invalides (Napoleon's Tomb), the Louvre, the Musee Picasso, the Musee Rodin and the gilt environs of City Hall (to name a few). It was like Fodor's, but with better clothes. Even in such vaunted company, however, two spaces stood out, in part because they aren't included in any tourist handbook. The first was the Palais de Justice, the complex that houses the French equivalent of the supreme court, where Clare Waight Keller's debut for Givenchy was held; the second the Russian embassy, where Comme des Garcons unveiled its collection. Neither institution had ever hosted a fashion show before, so it was everyone's first time. -- VANESSA FRIEDMAN, fashion director, Styles

It takes a lot to make the jaded fashion crowd go all wide-eyed and wobbly. But for his first women's show in Paris, Thom Browne managed to do just that. First he dreamed up a -- well, dream scenario, involving two young girls bedding down for the night. Then he threw in two space-suited Michelin (wo)men dancing down the aisles. Then he produced a collection of extraordinary technical achievement that featured attenuated silhouettes in traditional American fabrics (seersucker, tartan) woven almost entirely from tulle. And then he finished up with a Chinese dragon/unicorn that wobbled out behind its fairy godmother like a childhood fantasy come to life. Which, Mr. Browne said, pretty much described what fashion meant to him. At which point everyone was ready to wish upon a star. -- V.F.

In theory, they turned out to support Miroslava Duma at the official opening party for Fashion Tech Lab, her incubator, investment fund and philanthropic organization targeting new technologies. In practice, on the penultimate night of Paris Fashion Week, they also came to drink Champagne. ""This industry is waking up to the fact it can't ignore innovation in the field anymore,"" said Ms. Duma, surrounded by friends like Stella McCartney, Demna Gvasalia, Antoine Arnault and Maria Grazia Chiuri. ""More and more brands have now realized that they need to embrace innovation, particularly when it comes to sustainability. The future is coming, whether we like it or not."" To prove her point, a series of installations were on show for guests to see what could come next. Threads made from spider silk, upcycled yarn, stem-cell-engineered leather and diamonds sourced from above the ground elicited both curiosity and Instagram posts, as did a robotic barman, pouring mojitos ordered via tablets, much to the excitement of the crowd. -- E.P.

Among all the big shows of the week, it's is the small ones that sometimes have the most impact. Such was the case with the return of Andre Walker to Paris Fashion Week. The veteran New York designer staged a presentation on the stairs of Les Arts Decoratifs, where he showed a collection of clothing he originally designed between 1982 and 1986. The patterns were reconstituted from the original patterns, and three decades later seemed surprisingly au courant. There were blanket jackets (a collaboration with Pendleton) with beautiful cut sleeves, wrap skirts and dresses with folds. The mix of men's and women's looks signaled not only where Mr. Walker is coming from, but also where he's going. -- M.J.G.

The vertigo you get snapping between the actual world and the fashion world during the monthlong sabbatical from reality known fashion month can be intense. A terror attack in London, destruction in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Texas, hurricanes and flooding, a mass shooting in Las Vegas -- meanwhile, frocks. But the news creeps in, even to fashion. At Balenciaga, Demna Gvasalia worked up newspaper prints. They've been around in fashion before -- remember John Galliano's famous newsprint dress for Dior? -- but Mr. Gvasalia scrambled the script, filling his column inches with gibberish dummy copy and photos only of happy people. ""I wanted happy news,"" he said backstage. It's a pipe dream: fake news. But still, you could dare to dream, if only for a minute. -- M.S.

Undercover Brought Out Many, Many Twins The Undercover designer Jun Takahashi is one of the great showman working in fashion. Staged at the 19th-century Le Grand Hotel in Paris, his show began with pairs of models who walked side by side, hand in hand under a spotlight. Each couple wore looks that spoke to each another in some way: two identically cut V-neck shifts, one in T-shirt material printed with Cindy Sherman's face, and the other made from scarlet red silk covered in embroidered sequin cats. Others wore voluminous short-sleeve track suits; matching brooches in monogram-style letters; and what were made to look like pearl earrings, but dramatically oversize and partially crushed, resembling dented Ping-Pong balls. Mr. Takahashi created 32 looks like these before closing the show with five sets of real identical twins, dressed in matching blue and white Peter Pan dresses inspired by the Grady twins in the 1980 horror film ""The Shining."" The complexity of finding, and casting, so many pairs of twin sisters was a serious feat, echoing one of Mr. Takahashi's collections from over a decade before, for spring 2004, in which he also sent identical twins down the catwalk. -- Alexa Brazilian, fashion features director, T magazine

At the end of more than three weeks of fashion shows in different cities, the last day of Paris Fashion Week often brings with it a bunch of tired, overstimulated fashion editors waiting for sundown. However, at Moncler Gamme Rouge, weary faces brightened with smiles as Ed Sheeran's ""Shape of You"" began to play, spotlights made giant disco balls glimmer, and a troupe of American ""hiplet"" ballerinas emerged in a conga line dancing to the beat en pointe. The dance company was formed by the 66-year-old Chicago choreographer Homer Hans Bryant, whose fusion of traditional ballet and hip-hop has sent the internet aflutter. The girls performed in vignettes peppered throughout the regular run of show, for which the designer Giambattista Valli clad models in cozy heather gray ""Flashdance""-style leg warmers, diaphanous white lace dresses and red, white and blue iterations of the French brand's signature puffer. For the finale, the dancers high-stepped their way off the stage to the sounds of the Florida duo Black Violin, who, fittingly, mix hip-hop with classical violin and viola. -- A.B.","Larger-than-life sites, lots of waterworks and more highlights from the final leg of fashion month.",699c90c1-6a82-589d-ae08-19fdef569511,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/05/fashion/05paris-moments-alpha/05paris-moments-main-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=5e0f6bb572a00fc2f4b4e86ba389fdcfaf384e8c42b64cbecb6d1e39d296f1d3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Moments from Paris Fashion Week.,699c90c1-6a82-589d-ae08-19fdef569511,Demo_data/D1_img2/1699c90c1-6a82-589d-ae08-19fdef569511.jpg,19,"The Top 10 Moments of Paris Fashion Week Gifts are often left on front row seats at fashion shows for guests. Rarely, however, are they placed on every seat. And they are never black hooded plastic rain ponchos, with the name of a designer across the back. Such was the case at Rick Owens on Thursday evening. For his eerie, water-soaked show at the Palais du Tokyo, overlooking the banks of the Seine, models dressed in strange silhouettes that resembled alien cocoons and took a trip through fountain mists. The seated audience, bedecked in their ponchos, looked like they were taking a different kind of ride: a high fashion log flume, perhaps, as they were showered from on high. Five days later, inside the Grand Palais, the elements emerged again, this time at Chanel. Karl Lagerfeld had commissioned a giant replica of the Verdon Gorge in the south of France, which took two months to construct and had six waterfalls, all rushing into a gully below the catwalk. The aquatic theme then continued with the collection, a playful 89-look procession of vinyl rain gear. But even imported Mother Nature can have her unpredictable way; half a dozen hats were blown off models' heads by the sheer force of the cascades. Nevertheless, waterproofing has rarely looked so chic. -- ELIZABETH PATON, European correspondent, Styles

Saint Laurent Had the Venue to End All Venues A brand's power and success can often be revealed in its choice of space, and Saint Laurent was a case in point. The French brand, now designed by Anthony Vaccarello, opened up Paris Fashion Week in the most beautiful place imaginable: at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. Showgoers sat on a set at the base of the Trocadero, and as models emerged, the Eiffel Tower glittered as if on cue. With such an impressive backdrop, the fashion needed to be powerful, and it was. For the show's finale, couture-like feather and leather gowns came down the runway, one more beautiful than the next. -- MALINA JOSEPH GILCHRIST, style director, women's, T magazine

In a season in which casting directors appeared at last to be inching toward diversity and inclusivity on the runway -- with leaps and bounds still to go -- I was most struck by the omnipresence of the beautiful redhead Teddy Quinlivan. She's been a familiar face for several seasons, but during this one, midway during New York Fashion Week, she came out as transgender. And in a rare cheering moment, the reaction was first celebratory (it was a brave revelation) and then resolutely normal. Then she resumed her career without incident and swept the shows in Paris -- Dior, Dries, Margiela, Chloe, Paco Rabanne, Haider Ackermann, Sacai, Miu Miu, Louis Vuitton -- not as a token or an example, just another woman with a great look and sixth sense about how to mow down a catwalk. Sometimes, progress comes with a shout. Other times, no less worthy, with a shrug. -- MATTHEW SCHNEIER, deputy fashion critic and reporter, Styles

Media,"How a Cryptic Message, 'Interested in Data?,' Led to the Panama Papers",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/business/media/how-a-cryptic-message-interested-in-data-led-to-the-panama-papers.html,"Bastian Obermayer, left, and Frederik Obermaier, two of the journalists at Suddeutsche Zeitung, who began investigating the Panama Papers more than a year ago.

PARIS -- The leak of millions of private financial documents linking scores of the world's rich and powerful to a secretive Panamanian law firm peddling in shell companies and offshore bank accounts began more than a year ago with a cryptic message to a German newspaper from an anonymous whistle-blower. ""Hello, this is John Doe,"" the source wrote to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, a Munich-based newspaper that had worked on several investigations into tax evasion and money-laundering scandals. ""Interested in data?"" ""We're very interested,"" replied Bastian Obermayer, a veteran of several investigations into financial scandals. In the months that followed, the confidential source fed Suddeutsche's reporters a steady stream of emails, scanned letters, photographs and client data ripped from the servers of Mossack Fonseca, a Panama City law firm that has been dogged for decades by investigations into its suspected connections to money laundering. It was a trove that ultimately added up to 11.5 million individual files equivalent to 2.6 terabytes of data.

The German reporters worked for more than two months verifying that the documents were genuine and trying to unravel the complex web of secret transactions. ""It became an addiction,"" Mr. Obermayer's colleague, Frederik Obermaier, wrote in an emailed response to questions. ""We often messaged each other at crazy times, like 2 a.m. or 4 a.m. about the newest findings."" But the sheer volume of data contained in the initial batch soon overwhelmed the German newspaper's five-person investigations team. The paper turned for help to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington, D.C., which has coordinated several previous global projects on financial data leaks. Within weeks, the ICIJ had assembled an army of about 400 journalists from more than 100 news organizations in 80 countries, including The Guardian and BBC in Britain, the French daily Le Monde, the Sonntagszeitung in Switzerland, and L'Espresso, an Italian weekly newsmagazine. Many of the same journalists had collaborated with the center before on investigations into tax havens including the ""Swiss Leaks"" project in 2015 and the ""Lux Leaks"" series in 2014. The ICIJ did not approach to The New York Times to participate. ""This is an important subject, which we have written about ourselves, and continue to follow,"" said Matt Purdy, a deputy executive editor at The Times. The leaked documents provide even more information, he added, and the work is to be applauded. The media partners dissected the mountain of data that the Suddeutsche's journalists received in several batches, each of which were forwarded to a secure ICIJ server. The project was code-named Prometheus, after the Titan from Greek mythology who stole the secret of fire from the gods.

Luke Harding of The Guardian, a former Moscow correspondent and a veteran of several international collaborations, including WikiLeaks in 2010 and the Edward Snowden leaks in 2013, said the constant stream of new material meant that reporters were regularly relying on each other to help them keep track of new details. Unlike past projects, where the leaked data were provided as a ""discreet, one-off leaks"" of hundreds or at most thousands of documents, ""this was in real time,"" said Mr. Harding, whose team focused on transactions involving individuals with ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. ""We were constantly getting new data."" With such a large number of people trolling through the same database, the partners needed to agree early on with a common strategy for collaboration and for parsing out the research, as well as a joint promise to hold off on publishing until everyone was ready. The partners held a series of secret meetings, some of which involved more than 100 people. The first took place at a rented room of the National Press Club in Washington in June, followed by others in Munich, London and Lillehammer, Norway.

""The danger was always that if something happened in the world and the reporters in that country would get terribly excited and want to publish right away,"" Gerard Ryle, the director of ICIJ, said.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions.
* $15 minimum wage for federal contractors will take effect Jan. 30. About a dozen staffers at ICIJ, plus freelancers, devoted themselves entirely to the project, building the tools used by its partners while also preparing a dozen or so of its own stories on the leak. Mr. Ryle and his deputy, Marina Walker Guevara, were in near-constant communication with what had become a sprawling team. ""This was not a story where the documents were the whole story,"" Mr. Ryle said. ""You had to work for it, you had to go outside of the documents. You could see a window, but you had go out and look.""

The ICIJ made a number of powerful research tools available to the consortium that the group had developed for previous leak investigations. Those included a secure, Facebook-type forum where reporters could post the fruits of their research, as well as database search program called ""Blacklight"" that allowed the teams to hunt for specific names, countries or sources. While the original documents were written in 25 different languages, most of the communication on the forum took place in English, with reporters actively sharing interesting tidbits with the relevant specialized teams. Each news organization took their own precautions, restricting access to the secure computers that were used to connect to the ICIJ's servers and ensuring that these were not accessible through their newsrooms' regular networks. Once specific names were found in the database, reporters dug deeper for any clues that might connect those individuals with a shell company, a bank account, or an ever-widening cast of characters. Working in concert with a team of reporters out of The Guardian's safe room, Mr. Harding uncovered a web of more than 100 complex international transactions that revolved around an offshore firm linked to a musician named Sergei Roldugin, who is one of Mr. Putin's closest friends. ""We knew there was a link to Putin's buddy,"" Mr. Harding said. ""We knew money was being sent offshore from Russian state banks and being recycled back into Russia"" through the offshore company. Late last year, he said, the teams ultimately managed to establish a connection between that firm and another that owned an upscale ski resort near St. Petersburg that is a favorite of Mr. Putin. Further reporting eventually revealed that the same resort was the venue for the secret 2013 wedding of Mr. Putin's daughter Yekaterina news of which only surfaced last year.

PARIS -- The leak of millions of private financial documents linking scores of the world's rich and powerful to a secretive Panamanian law firm peddling in shell companies and offshore bank accounts began more than a year ago with a cryptic message to a German newspaper from an anonymous whistle-blower. ""Hello, this is John Doe,"" the source wrote to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, a Munich-based newspaper that had worked on several investigations into tax evasion and money-laundering scandals. ""Interested in data?"" ""We're very interested,"" replied Bastian Obermayer, a veteran of several investigations into financial scandals. In the months that followed, the confidential source fed Suddeutsche's reporters a steady stream of emails, scanned letters, photographs and client data ripped from the servers of Mossack Fonseca, a Panama City law firm that has been dogged for decades by investigations into its suspected connections to money laundering. It was a trove that ultimately added up to 11.5 million individual files equivalent to 2.6 terabytes of data.

The German reporters worked for more than two months verifying that the documents were genuine and trying to unravel the complex web of secret transactions. ""It became an addiction,"" Mr. Obermayer's colleague, Frederik Obermaier, wrote in an emailed response to questions. ""We often messaged each other at crazy times, like 2 a.m. or 4 a.m. about the newest findings."" But the sheer volume of data contained in the initial batch soon overwhelmed the German newspaper's five-person investigations team. The paper turned for help to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists in Washington, D.C., which has coordinated several previous global projects on financial data leaks. Within weeks, the ICIJ had assembled an army of about 400 journalists from more than 100 news organizations in 80 countries, including The Guardian and BBC in Britain, the French daily Le Monde, the Sonntagszeitung in Switzerland, and L'Espresso, an Italian weekly newsmagazine. Many of the same journalists had collaborated with the center before on investigations into tax havens including the ""Swiss Leaks"" project in 2015 and the ""Lux Leaks"" series in 2014. The ICIJ did not approach to The New York Times to participate. ""This is an important subject, which we have written about ourselves, and continue to follow,"" said Matt Purdy, a deputy executive editor at The Times. The leaked documents provide even more information, he added, and the work is to be applauded. The media partners dissected the mountain of data that the Suddeutsche's journalists received in several batches, each of which were forwarded to a secure ICIJ server. The project was code-named Prometheus, after the Titan from Greek mythology who stole the secret of fire from the gods.

Luke Harding of The Guardian, a former Moscow correspondent and a veteran of several international collaborations, including WikiLeaks in 2010 and the Edward Snowden leaks in 2013, said the constant stream of new material meant that reporters were regularly relying on each other to help them keep track of new details. Unlike past projects, where the leaked data were provided as a ""discreet, one-off leaks"" of hundreds or at most thousands of documents, ""this was in real time,"" said Mr. Harding, whose team focused on transactions involving individuals with ties to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. ""We were constantly getting new data."" With such a large number of people trolling through the same database, the partners needed to agree early on with a common strategy for collaboration and for parsing out the research, as well as a joint promise to hold off on publishing until everyone was ready. The partners held a series of secret meetings, some of which involved more than 100 people. The first took place at a rented room of the National Press Club in Washington in June, followed by others in Munich, London and Lillehammer, Norway.

""The danger was always that if something happened in the world and the reporters in that country would get terribly excited and want to publish right away,"" Gerard Ryle, the director of ICIJ, said.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions.
* $15 minimum wage for federal contractors will take effect Jan. 30. About a dozen staffers at ICIJ, plus freelancers, devoted themselves entirely to the project, building the tools used by its partners while also preparing a dozen or so of its own stories on the leak. Mr. Ryle and his deputy, Marina Walker Guevara, were in near-constant communication with what had become a sprawling team. ""This was not a story where the documents were the whole story,"" Mr. Ryle said. ""You had to work for it, you had to go outside of the documents. You could see a window, but you had go out and look.""

The ICIJ made a number of powerful research tools available to the consortium that the group had developed for previous leak investigations. Those included a secure, Facebook-type forum where reporters could post the fruits of their research, as well as database search program called ""Blacklight"" that allowed the teams to hunt for specific names, countries or sources. While the original documents were written in 25 different languages, most of the communication on the forum took place in English, with reporters actively sharing interesting tidbits with the relevant specialized teams. Each news organization took their own precautions, restricting access to the secure computers that were used to connect to the ICIJ's servers and ensuring that these were not accessible through their newsrooms' regular networks. Once specific names were found in the database, reporters dug deeper for any clues that might connect those individuals with a shell company, a bank account, or an ever-widening cast of characters. Working in concert with a team of reporters out of The Guardian's safe room, Mr. Harding uncovered a web of more than 100 complex international transactions that revolved around an offshore firm linked to a musician named Sergei Roldugin, who is one of Mr. Putin's closest friends. ""We knew there was a link to Putin's buddy,"" Mr. Harding said. ""We knew money was being sent offshore from Russian state banks and being recycled back into Russia"" through the offshore company. Late last year, he said, the teams ultimately managed to establish a connection between that firm and another that owned an upscale ski resort near St. Petersburg that is a favorite of Mr. Putin. Further reporting eventually revealed that the same resort was the venue for the secret 2013 wedding of Mr. Putin's daughter Yekaterina news of which only surfaced last year.

Art & Design,Jenny Holzer's Desert X Installation Postponed Over Concern for Bighorn Sheep,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/arts/design/jenny-holzer-desert-x-sheep.html,"People traveling to the Coachella Valley in California this weekend for the opening of Desert X, a free, public art exhibition that brings large-scale installations to the desert, won't be seeing a new work from the artist Jenny Holzer, at least not as it was originally conceived. Ms. Holzer's work, ""BEFORE I BECAME AFRAID, 2019,"" a text-based projection piece about gun violence, has been postponed indefinitely.

""There's been a pneumonia outbreak in the bighorn sheep population in this region, so they're in a more sensitive, vulnerable state,"" Jack Thompson, the regional director of the Wildlands Conservancy, which oversees the land where the installation was set to take place, explained by phone. ""The site that we had planned initially just became not viable after we had observed increased activity of the bighorn sheep next to the site.""

Mr. Thompson said that the conservancy started to realize that there was an outbreak in November and since then, it's seen at least 25 bighorn sheep die from the infection. ""But I wouldn't doubt that it's quite a lot more than that,"" he said, adding that the Fish and Wildlife department will have a more concrete estimate after it completes a survey in March.

It's not clear what kind of affect Ms. Holzer's installation would have had on the sheep, but Mr. Thompson said that because the animals had been wandering closer to the site, and acting ""more unpredictable,"" the project, which was initially approved, became ""an unacceptable risk to animals and visitors as well.""","The artist's light projection piece, which focused on gun violence, was slated to appear during the desert exhibition's opening weekend.",791539c6-f290-51ce-9725-0ff8acdef991,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/08/arts/08desertx-still/08desertx-still-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=e7e0a9c9188fa03534817cb0c45a37d2c4157b28e3c8331434e7c328ee32d2bf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The artist Jenny Holzer, in front of her public art project ""For the City,"" in 2005 in New York.",791539c6-f290-51ce-9725-0ff8acdef991,Demo_data/D1_img2/1791539c6-f290-51ce-9725-0ff8acdef991.jpg,14,"Jenny Holzer's Desert X Installation Postponed Over Concern for Bighorn Sheep People traveling to the Coachella Valley in California this weekend for the opening of Desert X, a free, public art exhibition that brings large-scale installations to the desert, won't be seeing a new work from the artist Jenny Holzer, at least not as it was originally conceived.

Art & Design,5 Art Accounts to Follow on Instagram Now,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/arts/design/instagram-art-accounts-to-follow.html,"Months into the pandemic, barreling toward the presidential election, it's difficult to know what we should be viewing or even trusting. The following Instagram accounts offer what I consider credible information in a world full of upheaval and unrest. What to read? What to question? What to believe? Here are some thoughts.

Art and design are often synonymous -- many art museums have design departments -- but when it comes to the ethics, challenges and achievements of design, the British critic and author Alice Rawsthorn is virtually unparalleled. Every week, Ms. Rawsthorn devotes her feed to a personage or problem. Recent ones include the Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx and the American midcentury duo Charles and Ray Eames. Her ongoing ""Design in a Pandemic"" series is particularly timely. One post showcased light, portable beds made from recycled materials designed during the lockdown in India by Vikram Dhawan and his brother, who run a cardboard factory in Rajasthan, India. Another highlighted police helmets in the Indian city of Chennai, designed by the artist Gowtham, which look like a microscopic image of the coronavirus. Countering catastrophe with human ingenuity and occasional humor, Ms. Rawsthorn helps you make sense of the environment around you.

Museums around the world have come under fire as protests challenging discrimination and oppression have erupted. Museu de Arte de Sao Paulo Assis Chateaubriand has been ahead of the curve in trying to address the history of slavery and colonialism in Brazil and the way this manifests itself in survey art collections. The museum has one of the most innovative ways of displaying art that was designed by the architect Lino Bo Bardi. Paintings rest on ""easels"" suspended in glass on concrete bases, and this Instagram account shows installations in the galleries in which European old masters sit alongside Indigenous artists. A recent post highlighted a richly patterned 18th-century altarpiece of the Virgin of Copacabana, created in what is today Bolivia and combining Christian and Andean beliefs. Another showed the brightly colored geometric abstraction of the modern painter Rubem Valentim, which fuses European abstraction with Afro-Brazilian motifs. (If you can't read the Portuguese captions, just hit the ""translate"" button at the bottom of each post.)

What to read? And how to read? Hopscotch Reading Room, located in a complex of art galleries and studios in Berlin, was started by Siddhartha Lokanandi, who worked for the publisher Verso in New York. The bookshop takes its name from the Argentine author Julio Cortazar's experimental novel ""Hopscotch"" (1966), which had a ""table of instructions"" telling readers that they could skip around and read the novel in a nonlinear fashion. Hopscotch Reading Room similarly tries to disrupt ""linear"" thinking, describing itself as ""a bookshop focusing on Non-Western & Diasporic perspectives."" Some recent offerings include ""Evidentiary Bodies -- Nudewalk"" (2018), the handmade score created by Barbara Hammer and Norman Scott Johnson for the closing event at Ms. Hammer's exhibition at the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art in New York. Another Hopscotch post featured in the book ""What is Islamic Art? Between Religion and Perception"" (2019), by Wendy M.K. Shaw, which explores the relationship of the arts to the Quran, Hadith, Sufism, ancient philosophy and poetry -- but also, ambitiously, uses Islamic art as a model for decolonizing global art history.

Comedians have long been telling us that the best way to change a person's mind (or politics) is through laughter. Liz Montague's simple, wry cartoons do this with a gentle humor that shows our human foibles and frustrations, but from the perspective of a Black woman living through a period of unrest and upheaval. One cartoon shows a man and a woman standing in a field with the woman, holding a pair of binoculars, saying, ""Looks like progress, but it's too soon to tell."" Another depicts two women preparing for a protest (one of them is creating a ""Black Lives Matter"" poster) and a ringing smartphone. ""Just ignore it,"" one of them says, ""my white friends keep checking in on me because they think racism is new."" Funny and wince-worthy.

Visibility, recognition and inclusion are some of the goals of both politicians and protesters at the moment. These can also be achieved through art, as Project 562 shows. Initiated by the photographer Matika Wilbur, a member of the Swinomish and Tulalip tribes of the State of Washington, the project aims to photograph Native Americans from 562 federally recognized tribal nations. The results are majestic, often moving and beautiful portraits, like one of Wilson Mungnak Hoogendorn and Oilver Tusagvik, Inupiaq brothers in their early 20s from Nome, Alaska, who were the first to summit Mount Denali in the 2019 climbing season. Another exceptional post features Sage Chanell, an Absentee Shawnee, Ponca, Lakota Sioux, and Otoe performer who won Miss International Two Spirit competitions a few years ago.

Her ongoing ""Design in a Pandemic"" series is particularly timely. One post showcased light, portable beds made from recycled materials designed during the lockdown in India by Vikram Dhawan and his brother, who run a cardboard factory in Rajasthan, India. Another highlighted police helmets in the Indian city of Chennai, designed by the artist Gowtham, which look like a microscopic image of the coronavirus. Countering catastrophe with human ingenuity and occasional humor, Ms. Rawsthorn helps you make sense of the environment around you.

Museums around the world have come under fire as protests challenging discrimination and oppression have erupted. Museu de Arte de Sao Paulo Assis Chateaubriand has been ahead of the curve in trying to address the history of slavery and colonialism in Brazil and the way this manifests itself in survey art collections. The museum has one of the most innovative ways of displaying art that was designed by the architect Lino Bo Bardi. Paintings rest on ""easels"" suspended in glass on concrete bases, and this Instagram account shows installations in the galleries in which European old masters sit alongside Indigenous artists. A recent post highlighted a richly patterned 18th-century altarpiece of the Virgin of Copacabana, created in what is today Bolivia and combining Christian and Andean beliefs. Another showed the brightly colored geometric abstraction of the modern painter Rubem Valentim, which fuses European abstraction with Afro-Brazilian motifs.

What to read? And how to read? Hopscotch Reading Room, located in a complex of art galleries and studios in Berlin, was started by Siddhartha Lokanandi, who worked for the publisher Verso in New York. The bookshop takes its name from the Argentine author Julio Cortazar's experimental novel ""Hopscotch"" (1966), which had a ""table of instructions"" telling readers that they could skip around and read the novel in a nonlinear fashion. Hopscotch Reading Room similarly tries to disrupt ""linear"" thinking, describing itself as ""a bookshop focusing on Non-Western & Diasporic perspectives."" Some recent offerings include ""Evidentiary Bodies -- Nudewalk"" (2018), the handmade score created by Barbara Hammer and Norman Scott Johnson for the closing event at Ms. Hammer's exhibition at the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art in New York. Another Hopscotch post featured in the book ""What is Islamic Art? Between Religion and Perception"" (2019), by Wendy M.K. Shaw, which explores the relationship of the arts to the Quran, Hadith, Sufism, ancient philosophy and poetry -- but also, ambitiously, uses Islamic art as a model for decolonizing global art history.

Comedians have long been telling us that the best way to change a person's mind (or politics) is through laughter. Liz Montague's simple, wry cartoons do this with a gentle humor that shows our human foibles and frustrations, but from the perspective of a Black woman living through a period of unrest and upheaval. One cartoon shows a man and a woman standing in a field with the woman, holding a pair of binoculars, saying, ""Looks like progress, but it's too soon to tell."" Another depicts two women preparing for a protest (one of them is creating a ""Black Lives Matter"" poster) and a ringing smartphone. ""Just ignore it,"" one of them says, ""my white friends keep checking in on me because they think racism is new."" Funny and wince-worthy.

Visibility, recognition and inclusion are some of the goals of both politicians and protesters at the moment. These can also be achieved through art, as Project 562 shows. Initiated by the photographer Matika Wilbur, a member of the Swinomish and Tulalip tribes of the State of Washington, the project aims to photograph Native Americans from 562 federally recognized tribal nations. The results are majestic, often moving and beautiful portraits, like one of Wilson Mungnak Hoogendorn and Oilver Tusagvik, Inupiaq brothers in their early 20s from Nome, Alaska, who were the first to summit Mount Denali in the 2019 climbing season. Another exceptional post features Sage Chanell, an Absentee Shawnee, Ponca, Lakota Sioux, and Otoe performer who won Miss International Two Spirit competitions a few years ago. Sage Chanell, a transgender woman, recounts on Instagram a grandfather saying it was OK if she didn't remember the tribal songs meant for boys. ""Well, maybe they're not meant for you to remember,"" Grandpa said. Design during the pandemic; a bookshop in Berlin; a museum in São Paulo; a cartoonist addressing racism; and photographs documenting Native Americans.",14,['14'],14
Music,12 Essential Lesser-Known Power-Pop Songs,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/arts/music/power-pop-songs.html,"It was the summer of 1979, and parts of the world were in a state of near-surrender: In Britain, millions were reeling from the infamous ""Winter of Discontent,"" in which freezing temperatures and hot-tempered labor strikes left many people jobless, and some London streets buried in trash. Anxious Americans were fuming over the country's second oil shortage in less than a decade, eventually prompting President Jimmy Carter to declare a nationwide ""crisis of confidence."" But in record stores, there was a fast-acting antidote to this ongoing malaise: The eternally youthful, perpetually tuneful genre known as power pop, which by 1979 was dominating vinyl bins and ""American Bandstand."" That year alone would see seminal new releases from Cheap Trick, the Beat, the Knack and Shoes -- bands that merged commanding power chords with sticky, Beatles-obliged melodies. They were among the biggest names in a movement that lasted from the late 1970s through the early 1980s, in which hundreds of bands released irresistible, radio-ready singles brimming with contagious choruses, shame-free (and sometimes shameless) over-harmonizing and no shortage of love-struck longing. Of course, most of the best power-pop numbers never made it to the airwaves: The genre wasn't as credible as punk, or as cool as new wave. And some of its finest practitioners were regional bands who -- whether thanks to snobbery or geography -- couldn't win over tastemakers in London or Los Angeles. Yet over the last few decades, great care has been taken in honoring these shoulda-been stars, whose work has been preserved in overstuffed compilations and Spotify playlists. Together, they offer a sort of secret Top 40 of lost hits and near-misses.

Among vinyl devotees, the Records will be forever known for the dizzying late-70s single ""Starry Eyes"" -- a modest United States radio hit upon release, and a staple of compilations to this day (and rightfully so). But deep-cuts like ""Girl"" demonstrate the British group's soft powers. Led by the vocalist John Wicks, who died in 2018, the Records always seemed more indebted to studio-trained, throwback pop acts than the more caustic punk of the time. The result was songs like ""Girl,"" which unites charging guitar riffs with the sort of airy, all-hands-on-deck harmonies even the Hollies would have envied.

Like many of their '80s contemporaries, Treble Boys didn't remain in power (or in power pop) for long: After forming in New York City in late 1981, the band was quickly embraced by the CBGB founder Hilly Kristal, even landing a slot on the club's short-lived TV show. Barely two years later, the group was gone -- but not before leaving behind this indelible Boys-meet-girl tale of a doomed dance floor crush. Kicking off with a percolating electro-beat, ""Julie-Anne"" soon gives way to dreamy waves of guitar lines and a sugary, synth-assisted chorus. It's all over before you quite know what hit you, but like so many short-lived flirtations, ""Julie-Anne"" lingers long afterward.

Not long after Lance Loud's famed appearance on ""An American Family"" -- the landmark 1973 reality-TV series in which Loud came out to his family, and to the world -- he moved to New York City and became the frontman for this influential glam-punk-pop outfit. The Mumps' ""Muscleboys"" is a stomping blast of lovestruck wistfulness, bolstered by Loud's Tarzan-like kickoff cry and a jubilant chorus. It's also a rare example of a happily, openly queer anthem in the all-too-hetero domain of power pop -- not to mention a primo workout song in its own right.

With its walloping keyboards, blistering guitars and eerie sci-fi vibe, ""Yellow Pills"" is about as ominous-sounding as power pop gets -- a chronicle of zonked-out bliss with an appropriately amped-up opening verse: ""Everybody's feeling groovy/Everybody's got tight pants on/'Cause everybody feels like they were/Just made by the creator."" Based out of Los Angeles, 20/20 was tipped for mainstream superstardom (""This is gonna be their year,"" Dick Clark declared during the group's 1980 ""American Bandstand"" performance). The band dissolved a few years later, but the legacy of ""Yellow Pills"" would groove on for decades, its name eventually inspiring a beloved power-pop fanzine and compilation series.

The British group the Jags had everything you could have wanted from a late-70s power-pop act: colorful suits, a cool name and a logo that even the Strokes would envy. Thankfully, they also had some equally ace tunes, most notably this taut, semi-menacing rocker about a jilted guy expressing his many frustrations to the voice on the other line. ""Back of My Hand"" arrived just a few years after the Nerves' seminal (and Blondie-covered) ""Hanging on the Telephone,"" and a few years before Tommy Tutone's hit ""867-5309/Jenny"" -- proof that no genre captured the era's many missed connections quite like power pop.

There are unmistakable traces of post-punk in this spiffy, spiky charmer, which features shambling guitars, an unfussy bass line and sparse production. But the frontwoman Helen McCookerybook injects a half-dozen or so hooks in each verse, and the song's delightful chorus -- ""I'd really, really, really like to be friends with you"" -- is essentially a power-pop mantra. Purists can feel free to argue about whether this has enough ""power"" to fit on this list; the rest of us can simply hum ""24 Hours"" all day. The Rubinoos, 'I Never Thought It Would Happen' (1977)

This Connecticut quartet certainly didn't lack moxie: their members carried business cards that read ""THE TWEEDS: ROCK N ROLL ... the way you want it!"" But that kind of confidence is justified by tracks like ""I Need That Record."" You can hear the roots of future alt-rock acts like Sloan in the first 10 seconds of this dynamo number, which is full of hot-rodding riffs and high-energy yelps.

Television,Mindy Kaling's Netflix Show Tells a New Kind of Story: One Like Hers,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/arts/television/mindy-kaling-never-have-I-ever-netflix.html,"Mindy Kaling isn't trying to tell everyone's story -- she's had to break a lot of boundaries just to tell her own. Her new Netflix series, ""Never Have I Ever,"" which debuted Monday, looks to break another, offering a story virtually absent from American screens until now: a coming-of-age comedy about the complicated life of a modern-day first-generation Indian-American teenage girl. ""For all of us in the writers' room, particularly those of us who were the children of immigrants, which comprised most of my staff, it was about sharing those stories of feeling 'other,'"" said Kaling, who is also a first-generation Indian-American. ""One of the best parts about being in that room was realizing that they felt so many of the same things I did, and it was such a relief. It made me feel like, 'OK, I'm, like, normal.'"" For Kaling, 40, who has spent most of her career writing characters she can also play, the series is something of a new frontier. A longtime comedy writer, she got her break in her mid-20s as a writer for the American version of ""The Office,"" in which she also starred as the sassy, fearless Kelly Kapoor. After about eight seasons, she parlayed that success into the ""The Mindy Project,"" which she created, wrote and again starred in; the show's lead character was loosely inspired by her mother. (Kaling has also written two humorous autobiographical books.)

More recently, she cocreated a 10-part adaptation of the 1994 feature ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" for Hulu, updated with a more diverse cast. Not all of her screen projects have been romantic comedies, but most have at least contained strong rom-com elements. So when Netflix approached her about doing something totally different, she jumped at the chance. ""They had read my books and really loved the parts where I talk about being an adolescent and a teenager,"" said Kaling, who created and wrote the series with Lang Fisher, a ""Mindy Project"" alum. ""Because there isn't a show like this,"" she said, ""they thought it would be a great fit for them."" In casting the series, Kaling said, she grew tired early on of seeing the same ""28-year-old, gorgeous Bollywood stars"" audition for parts -- particularly for the lead role of Devi, an overachieving high school sophomore, partly based on Kaling, with a short fuse that gets her into difficult situations. She decided to try a different approach. ""It would be such a lie to have one of them play me,"" Kaling said of the actresses who first auditioned. ""It just felt like the audience would think: 'This is crazy. This is nothing like what Mindy looked like when she was a teenager.'""

In a recent phone interview, Kaling talked about that casting process, about venturing beyond the romantic-comedy genre, and about what it was like to try to adapt some of her own experiences into a show about teens today. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. How much of the show is autobiographical? And how did you update it for Indian-American teenage girls today? Netflix was open to us doing it as something set in the '80s or the '90s, but I'd seen that done so well with shows like ""Fresh Off the Boat"" and ""Everybody Hates Chris."" I really wanted to speak to kids now. I also thought it would be a really great way to hire a lot of young Indian-American writers who can remember their teenage years more recently than me and fill our staff with them. I was also really greedy with the young actresses on the show. Maitreyi was a resource in herself. When she would do table reads, we would change the vernacular so it made sense for someone her age. What stood out about Maitreyi among the thousands of applicants to your open casting call? With Maitreyi, there was something about her. She later said that she was very intimidated to fly to L.A. to come audition, but when she spoke to us, she had natural confidence. I really loved that she was Tamil, which I am also. Also, I think about colorism a lot, and I liked that she wasn't like this red-haired, green-eyed, pale-skinned Indian girl. I liked that she looked a little bit more like someone that would be in my family. She also was just naturally funny.

It seems like you were usually in a rom-com space with your earlier work. Did you feel pigeonholed? I'll always love romantic comedies, and I don't see a world where I don't revisit that genre again. More even than writing about teenagers, writing about the Indian-American experience growing up was really fascinating to me. But it was also painful, too. If you're someone who has a sense of humor in your 20s and 30s, it most likely means that you had a very painful adolescence, right? You've been at the forefront of South Asian representation for a long time, but there's been some criticism that some of your early roles were stereotypical. What was that like for you? Do you feel you've grown from it? Denzel Washington once said something that always stuck with me. Someone asked him why he doesn't play villains more often, and he said something like: There's just so few of us, and I mean so much to my community that I feel like I can't do that in this lifetime. That really resonated with me, because I thought that was really smart of him in a way that I have not been smart. I come from comedy, where the funniest characters are the flawed ones, like Michael Scott [Steve Carell's character on ""The Office""], and my training was for writing those characters. The problem is, they're all white. So when you try to play that character and you're Indian, and you're the only Indian character people have, it's within their right to say: ""How dare you do that to us? We have no representation."" The character has bad priorities, is saying off-color things, is selfish and all these things that I'm not personally, but I find really fun to play. That's something that I have struggled with, because I just want to have the most enjoyable artistic experience. But that doesn't necessarily always fall in place with my role as a role model.

Do you still face that kind of criticism? I remember when the teaser trailer came out and Devi's praying, and she says, ""Hey, gods, it's me Devi Vishwakumar"" and there was a comment on Twitter saying, ""Oh, great that is totally not how Hindu girls talk."" And I remember being incensed because when my mom used to make us pray before we took the SATs, or before we got on a plane, and I didn't know all the different names of the gods because no one had taught me, I was just like: ""Hey, gods. Please let me do well on my SAT. I've been working really hard and it means a lot to my parents."" What I realized is that because we don't have a lot of different shows depicting Hindu teenagers praying [laughs], it offends people when it's not exactly the way that it was for them. I'm still trying to figure out a way to accept that criticism. Those people who watch the show, particularly young Indian-American women, are the people that I want to like it the most. And they're the ones that are going to be the toughest on me. So it's one of the biggest things I care about now as an artist.

So how do you deal with that pressure of telling a story you want to tell while not feeling that needs to be every South Asian person's story? I'm just telling a story that resonates with me, of a very specific character. And I think it's just me acknowledging that over and over. Also, I'd like to have a nice, long life so that I can tell enough stories with enough different kinds characters -- Indian, Pakistani, Muslim, etc. -- to show that there's lots of different kinds of ways to be Desi.

Her new Netflix series, ""Never Have I Ever,"" which debuted Monday, looks to break another, offering a story virtually absent from American screens until now: a coming-of-age comedy about the complicated life of a modern-day first-generation Indian-American teenage girl. ""For all of us in the writers' room, particularly those of us who were the children of immigrants, which comprised most of my staff, it was about sharing those stories of feeling 'other,'"" said Kaling, who is also a first-generation Indian-American. ""One of the best parts about being in that room was realizing that they felt so many of the same things I did, and it was such a relief. It made me feel like, 'OK, I'm, like, normal.'"" For Kaling, 40, who has spent most of her career writing characters she can also play, the series is something of a new frontier. A longtime comedy writer, she got her break in her mid-20s as a writer for the American version of ""The Office,"" in which she also starred as the sassy, fearless Kelly Kapoor. After about eight seasons, she parlayed that success into the ""The Mindy Project,"" which she created, wrote and again starred in; the show's lead character was loosely inspired by her mother. (Kaling has also written two humorous autobiographical books.)

More recently, she cocreated a 10-part adaptation of the 1994 feature ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" for Hulu, updated with a more diverse cast. Not all of her screen projects have been romantic comedies, but most have at least contained strong rom-com elements. So when Netflix approached her about doing something totally different, she jumped at the chance. ""They had read my books and really loved the parts where I talk about being an adolescent and a teenager,"" said Kaling, who created and wrote the series with Lang Fisher, a ""Mindy Project"" alum. ""Because there isn't a show like this,"" she said, ""they thought it would be a great fit for them."" In casting the series, Kaling said, she grew tired early on of seeing the same ""28-year-old, gorgeous Bollywood stars"" audition for parts -- particularly for the lead role of Devi, an overachieving high school sophomore, partly based on Kaling, with a short fuse that gets her into difficult situations. She decided to try a different approach. ""It would be such a lie to have one of them play me,"" Kaling said of the actresses who first auditioned. ""It just felt like the audience would think: 'This is crazy. This is nothing like what Mindy looked like when she was a teenager.'""

In a recent phone interview, Kaling talked about that casting process, about venturing beyond the romantic-comedy genre, and about what it was like to try to adapt some of her own experiences into a show about teens today. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. How much of the show is autobiographical? And how did you update it for Indian-American teenage girls today? Netflix was open to us doing it as something set in the '80s or the '90s, but I'd seen that done so well with shows like ""Fresh Off the Boat"" and ""Everybody Hates Chris."" I really wanted to speak to kids now. I also thought it would be a really great way to hire a lot of young Indian-American writers who can remember their teenage years more recently than me and fill our staff with them. I was also really greedy with the young actresses on the show. Maitreyi was a resource in herself. When she would do table reads, we would change the vernacular so it made sense for someone her age. What stood out about Maitreyi among the thousands of applicants to your open casting call? With Maitreyi, there was something about her. She later said that she was very intimidated to fly to L.A. to come audition, but when she spoke to us, she had natural confidence. I really loved that she was Tamil, which I am also. Also, I think about colorism a lot, and I liked that she wasn't like this red-haired, green-eyed, pale-skinned Indian girl. I liked that she looked a little bit more like someone that would be in my family. She also was just naturally funny.

It seems like you were usually in a rom-com space with your earlier work. Did you feel pigeonholed? I'll always love romantic comedies, and I don't see a world where I don't revisit that genre again. More even than writing about teenagers, writing about the Indian-American experience growing up was really fascinating to me. But it was also painful, too. If you're someone who has a sense of humor in your 20s and 30s, it most likely means that you had a very painful adolescence, right? You've been at the forefront of South Asian representation for a long time, but there's been some criticism that some of your early roles were stereotypical. What was that like for you? Do you feel you've grown from it? Denzel Washington once said something that always stuck with me. Someone asked him why he doesn't play villains more often, and he said something like: There's just so few of us, and I mean so much to my community that I feel like I can't do that in this lifetime. That really resonated with me, because I thought that was really smart of him in a way that I have not been smart. I come from comedy, where the funniest characters are the flawed ones, like Michael Scott [Steve Carell's character on ""The Office""], and my training was for writing those characters. The problem is, they're all white. So when you try to play that character and you're Indian, and you're the only Indian character people have, it's within their right to say: ""How dare you do that to us? We have no representation."" The character has bad priorities, is saying off-color things, is selfish and all these things that I'm not personally, but I find really fun to play. That's something that I have struggled with, because I just want to have the most enjoyable artistic experience. But that doesn't necessarily always fall in place with my role as a role model.

Do you still face that kind of criticism? I remember when the teaser trailer came out and Devi's praying, and she says, ""Hey, gods, it's me Devi Vishwakumar"" and there was a comment on Twitter saying, ""Oh, great that is totally not how Hindu girls talk."" And I remember being incensed because when my mom used to make us pray before we took the SATs, or before we got on a plane, and I didn't know all the different names of the gods because no one had taught me, I was just like: ""Hey, gods. Please let me do well on my SAT. I've been working really hard and it means a lot to my parents."" What I realized is that because we don't have a lot of different shows depicting Hindu teenagers praying [laughs], it offends people when it's not exactly the way that it was for them. I'm still trying to figure out a way to accept that criticism. Those people who watch the show, particularly young Indian-American women, are the people that I want to like it the most. And they're the ones that are going to be the toughest on me. So it's one of the biggest things I care about now as an artist.

So how do you deal with that pressure of telling a story you want to tell while not feeling that needs to be every South Asian person's story? I'm just telling a story that resonates with me, of a very specific character. And I think it's just me acknowledging that over and over. Also, I'd like to have a nice, long life so that I can tell enough stories with enough different kinds characters -- Indian, Pakistani, Muslim, etc. -- to show that there's lots of different kinds of ways to be Desi. I think that's the only way to do it. I also look at someone like Ava DuVernay. ""Cherish the Day"" is so different than ""A Wrinkle in Time,"" but both of them tell stories about young African-American women. I'd love to have that relationship with South Asians in America.

Travel,Heading to Seattle? What's New in Washington's Seaside City,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/20/travel/heading-to-seattle-whats-new-in-washingtons-seaside-city.html,"Advice to visit Seattle's Pike Place Market may border on cliche -- but for a good reason. Whether you're visiting Washington's seaside city for vacation or just stopping by en route to and from the coming Sasquatch music festival, Pike Place is an easy catch-all destination for shopping, eating and just plain walking around, said Kirk Johnson, The New York Times's Seattle bureau chief for the past three years. ""Almost any day of the week, especially on the weekend, it's a crazy fun scene of people shopping,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""There's also pretty good food."" He recommends wandering into whatever place -- especially a hole in the wall -- catches your eye. There is one specific restaurant Mr. Johnson likes: the Pink Door, which has no signage and can be found only by its rosy entrance. ""It's creative, interesting Italian,"" he said. ""In the summer they get a lot of great fresh vegetables and probably have the best tomato bruschetta I've had.""

He also recommends the nearby Pioneer Square, the oldest neighborhood in Seattle. Its historic architecture has charm, and the area isn't bad for a lunch break, he said. The clear favorite here is Salumi -- which, as the name suggests, is known for its cured meats. Mr. Johnson did warn, however, that it's necessary to plan for the fact that the restaurant has a long line as soon as it opens.

Pioneer Square is also a portal to Seattle's maritime world that remains alive and well. Ferry rides are a short walk away. Mr. Johnson said the ferry ride to Bainbridge Island provides ""a great view of the city,"" and it's not a long ride back to the mainland. Feel free to make a day of the waterfront, Mr. Johnson said. West Seattle is home to the city's closest semblance of a beach, and it has a boardwalk. Farther away, you could ride the Seattle Great Wheel or explore the miles of trails on foot or riding a bicycle. At some point, you may see sculptures emerging on the horizon -- that would be the Olympic Sculpture Park, which is operated by the Seattle Art Museum, Mr. Johnson said, and that's worth a visit itself. The museum, too, is ""almost always interesting,"" he said, ""and it's a beautiful building.""

People who want to experience Seattle's nearby charms can easily do so with a bicycle, Mr. Johnson said, if they want to get away from depending on a car. He takes a ride to Chateau Ste. Michelle, a famous winery outside the city. Starting in June, he said, Chateau Ste. Michelle hosts a summer concert series on its lawn. ""If it's a nice night, and the weather is good, it's a really great spot,"" he said. Or, if you prefer beer, Redhook Brewery & Forecasters Pub is across the street from the winery. Mr. Johnson admits he still has items to check off on his own Seattle bucket list. For example, he'd like to try Bill Speidel's Underground Tour, which follows underground passages through Seattle's historic downtown.

Dance,How Do You Reconstruct Lost Choreography?,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/arts/dance/how-do-you-reconstruct-lost-choreography-paul-taylor-tracer.html,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Kim Jones is a dance detective. That means she rescues lost works by stitching together fragments of ephemera -- a choreographer's notes, decades-old still images -- with original performers' fading memories to restage dances that take cues from source material, but are of necessity something new. ""Discovering something great choreographers created is unlocking a piece of romanticized history,"" said Ms. Jones, an associate professor of dance here at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. ""With work considered lost, curiosity compels me to dig into the past and reveal some of that mystery."" Ms. Jones, a former dancer with the Martha Graham Dance Company, has spent the past 18 months leading a team to reconstruct Paul Taylor's 1962 ""Tracer,"" with a set piece and costumes by Robert Rauschenberg. She is restaging the piece with Mr. Taylor's smaller dance company, Taylor 2, which will perform the work as part of a three-week residency at the university in September. Ms. Jones came to Mr. Taylor's attention after she reimagined the choreography for a lost 1935 Martha Graham solo work, ""Imperial Gesture,"" in 2013, at the invitation of Janet Eilber, the Graham company's artistic director. This is the first time that Mr. Taylor has authorized a reconstruction of his work outside his company.

""If we don't have film, it's a lost work,"" Ms. Eilber said. ""There are 181 works Martha Graham created, and we think we can authentically restage between 50 and 60 of them."" That's where Ms. Jones came in. ""Kim's reimagining of 'Imperial Gesture' brought it back to life,"" Ms. Eilber said. ""Not in its authentic original state, yet it recaptured so much of the inspiration."" ""'Lost' is something that may not be visible at the moment,"" Ms. Jones said. ""That doesn't mean it's gone forever. I approach a project like 'Tracer' as an exciting archival dig and an opportunity to explore the early postmodern genre. I'm not immediately worried about the outcome when I take on a project. My goal is to have a successful collaborative process."" Political, economic and cultural conditions fueling moments of creation are critical elements informing reconstruction of lost work, Ms. Jones said. ""When Graham created 'Imperial Gesture,' the work was in response to many factors including the rise of fascism in Europe, workers' rights, and the emergence of American expressive dance,"" she said. ""With 'Tracer,' it's the beginning of the Vietnam War. Rauschenberg is finding value in using found objects. Why? I want to bring these historical elements to my students and an audience.""

Ann Dils, a dance historian, professor and chair of the dance department at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, said that all reconstructions are reimaginings. ""We are always in a new historical moment,"" she said. ""Things that are 50 to 100 years old are new and surprising for contemporary audiences. Techniques that once underpinned those works have moved on. Body types have moved on, costuming and new ways of presenting contribute to the dance not being what it once was."" Choreographers may flesh out ideas early in their creative process only to abandon or occasionally absorb them into other, more enduring works. That was the case with Mr. Taylor's ""The Red Room,"" which debuted in 1964 and was later transformed into the surrealist ""Post Meridian."" ""Of Mr. Taylor's 144 completed works,"" Tom Patrick, the company's archival supervisor, said, ""a dozen or more are such transformations. There are another 12 to 15 in Paul's catalog that are impossible to revive, where no trace remains.""

""Tracer"" had its premiere on April 11, 1962, at the Theatre des Nations in Paris. The piece, created between two of Mr. Taylor's most notable works, ""Junction"" and ""Aureole,"" was performed until 1964. (It was last seen at the American Dance Festival in New London, Conn.) ""When I select which dances we keep doing, I generally choose dances that I want to see,"" Mr. Taylor said in an email. ""'Aureole' was one of those dances and to a smaller extent, so was 'Junction.' We did 'Tracer' for a while, and then it was time to move on.""

Though no video recording exists, ""Tracer"" offered Ms. Jones a considerably deeper trove of material to work with than ""Imperial Gesture.""

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Kim Jones is a dance detective. That means she rescues lost works by stitching together fragments of ephemera -- a choreographer's notes, decades-old still images -- with original performers' fading memories to restage dances that take cues from source material, but are of necessity something new. ""Discovering something great choreographers created is unlocking a piece of romanticized history,"" said Ms. Jones, an associate professor of dance here at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. ""With work considered lost, curiosity compels me to dig into the past and reveal some of that mystery."" Ms. Jones, a former dancer with the Martha Graham Dance Company, has spent the past 18 months leading a team to reconstruct Paul Taylor's 1962 ""Tracer,"" with a set piece and costumes by Robert Rauschenberg. She is restaging the piece with Mr. Taylor's smaller dance company, Taylor 2, which will perform the work as part of a three-week residency at the university in September. Ms. Jones came to Mr. Taylor's attention after she reimagined the choreography for a lost 1935 Martha Graham solo work, ""Imperial Gesture,"" in 2013, at the invitation of Janet Eilber, the Graham company's artistic director. This is the first time that Mr. Taylor has authorized a reconstruction of his work outside his company.

""If we don't have film, it's a lost work,"" Ms. Eilber said. ""There are 181 works Martha Graham created, and we think we can authentically restage between 50 and 60 of them."" That's where Ms. Jones came in. ""Kim's reimagining of 'Imperial Gesture' brought it back to life,"" Ms. Eilber said. ""Not in its authentic original state, yet it recaptured so much of the inspiration."" ""'Lost' is something that may not be visible at the moment,"" Ms. Jones said. ""That doesn't mean it's gone forever. I approach a project like 'Tracer' as an exciting archival dig and an opportunity to explore the early postmodern genre. I'm not immediately worried about the outcome when I take on a project. My goal is to have a successful collaborative process."" Political, economic and cultural conditions fueling moments of creation are critical elements informing reconstruction of lost work, Ms. Jones said. ""When Graham created 'Imperial Gesture,' the work was in response to many factors including the rise of fascism in Europe, workers' rights, and the emergence of American expressive dance,"" she said. ""With 'Tracer,' it's the beginning of the Vietnam War. Rauschenberg is finding value in using found objects. Why? I want to bring these historical elements to my students and an audience.""

Ann Dils, a dance historian, professor and chair of the dance department at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, said that all reconstructions are reimaginings. ""We are always in a new historical moment,"" she said. ""Things that are 50 to 100 years old are new and surprising for contemporary audiences. Techniques that once underpinned those works have moved on. Body types have moved on, costuming and new ways of presenting contribute to the dance not being what it once was."" Choreographers may flesh out ideas early in their creative process only to abandon or occasionally absorb them into other, more enduring works. That was the case with Mr. Taylor's ""The Red Room,"" which debuted in 1964 and was later transformed into the surrealist ""Post Meridian."" ""Of Mr. Taylor's 144 completed works,"" Tom Patrick, the company's archival supervisor, said, ""a dozen or more are such transformations. There are another 12 to 15 in Paul's catalog that are impossible to revive, where no trace remains.""

""Tracer"" had its premiere on April 11, 1962, at the Theatre des Nations in Paris. The piece, created between two of Mr. Taylor's most notable works, ""Junction"" and ""Aureole,"" was performed until 1964. (It was last seen at the American Dance Festival in New London, Conn.) ""When I select which dances we keep doing, I generally choose dances that I want to see,"" Mr. Taylor said in an email. ""'Aureole' was one of those dances and to a smaller extent, so was 'Junction.' We did 'Tracer' for a while, and then it was time to move on.""

If Only It Could Stay Longer.,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/arts/dance/review-white-light-festival-indian-dance-kerala-kalamandalam-kathakali-nrityagram.html,"""You've been there?"" friends said in envy after Wednesday's Nrityagram Dance Ensemble performance in the Gerald W. Lynch Theater. Yes, I've seen Nrityagram in India, at its home village near Bangalore and in Chennai -- and yet the New York audience is in no way shortchanged. These are among the world's greatest dancers; on Wednesday they gave as complete and fulfilling a vision of their art as any I have seen anywhere. The same isn't quite true with the Kerala Kalamandalam Kathakali Troupe production ""The Killing of Dussasana,"" performed on Sunday and Monday in the same theater, also as part of the White Light Festival's ""Sounds of India"" season. Though very fine and entirely welcome, this 80-minute performance felt like a vivid, unforgettable but incomplete sampler -- certainly to me, who saw two longer Kathakali performances in Kerala in 2014. New York is lucky, however, to have seen the two dissimilar genres in quick succession: Kathakali is all-male (with some performers playing women), and dance is an incidental part of its physical theatrics; Nrityagram is all-female (with some dancers representing male deities), and dance is central to it.

The spectacular makeup of the Kalamandalam players, their brightly formal costumes, the fabulous grotesquerie of their demonic characters (and the often cacophonous din of the percussion music accompanying them): These were marvelously intense, though that music seemed to take many aback, as did the story's goriness. In it, the giant Bhima not only kills the dangerous prince Dussasana but also rips out his entrails and bathes in his blood. This horror has a strong dash of comic caricature -- the mythological Keralan version of a Tarantino movie or a Martin McDonagh play. Scenes for the god Krishna and the heroine Draupadi showed different aspects of Kathakali gesture: heroic, divine and tragic emotions, for which the music changed drastically.

Because of visa problems and a personnel shortage, this company had its opening night postponed (a performance was added) and its production partly revised. While I'd like to have seen the staging as originally planned, I'd also love to see the company at greater length at its home; I cannot efface memories of sitting in the warm Kerala night air and enjoying the reaction of the locals to Kathakali as a genre they knew. For Westerners, one of the oddest features of Kathakali is how the ritualized artifice of the drama, with its scene changes hidden by a small curtain held up by two men, is informally surrounded by musicians who walk on and offstage during the action. With Nrityagram, as with most Indian classical dance, the musicians sit in a row, all cross-legged, at one side of the stage. Although the village of Nrityagram is in southern India, the ensemble performs Odissi, a genre deriving from Odisha (also called Orissa), the state halfway down India's eastern coast. Odissi's evolution has been singularly strange. Over 2,000 years old but close to extinction in the late 1940s and largely unknown in the early decades of Indian independence, it has become so successfully reconstructed (and to a large extent reimagined) that it is now loved and practiced around the world. In recent years, I have sometimes found it the single most beautiful dance form I've experienced. On Wednesday, I and many others were blown away.

The program's five dances -- including the world premiere of the duet ""Lalita Lavanga"" and the North American premiere of the solo ""Aali"" -- kept extending Odissi as we watched. Here was dance as music, meter, harmony, sculpture, architecture, drama, all on a sublime level. The bodies often became an spellbinding array of different S curves, vertical and horizontal, repeatedly changing with the shift of the pelvis, waist or shoulders. There are rapidly percussive or explosive jumps, footwork whose meters take arithmetic into pure form, facial expressions in which demonic glares melt into seraphic benignity. People seeing it for the first time were astounded -- but so was I. Does any other form so celebrate the configuration of a woman's body? These performers in their formal attire -- individually colored -- all possess what used to be called hourglass figures; the way the slender stem of the waist moves against the larger curves of the pelvis and chest becomes gloriously sensuous. More: It makes a tremendous kinesthetically impact through the theater. At the company's heart are its two leading performers: Surupa Sen (also the choreographer and artistic director) and Bijayini Satpathy. Items are introduced by Ms. Sen's voice explaining the content or style of the dance; in those that are principally concerned with illustrating sung poetry, Ms. Sathpathy briefly illustrates Ms. Sen's words with gestures and facial expressions. These demonstrations alone show phenomenal artistry, and yet they're mere preambles. ""Lalita Lavanga"" is a duet in which Ms. Sen and Ms. Satpathy express the love of Krishna and Radha (from the Gita Govinda poem); ""Aali,"" set to a poem by the 16th-century mystic Meera (or Mirabai) and dedicated to Krishna, is a solo for Ms. Sen. Female pulchritude, as shown by dance, is where Nrityagram begins; but these dances show how humanity possesses soul, how one person can depict nature and how the universe is present in the individual.

The lawsuit was filed in Federal District Court in Buffalo by Craig Maurizi, 57, a prominent coach and a former skating student of Mr. Callaghan's. Mr. Maurizi first told The New York Times in 1999 that Mr. Callaghan, 74, had begun an inappropriate sexual relationship with him when Mr. Maurizi was a minor and that the exploitive relationship continued, off and on, for years as the two men became coaching colleagues.

Mr. Callaghan, best known for coaching Tara Lipinski to an Olympic gold medal in 1998 and coaching Todd Eldredge to a world title and six national championships, has long denied any inappropriate conduct.

Last August, Mr. Callaghan was barred from figure skating permanently by the U.S. Center for SafeSport, a nonprofit organization created to track and investigate the abuse of athletes. The ban followed another allegation of sexual misconduct made against Mr. Callaghan by Adam Schmidt, a former skating student.

Health,Protein May Hold the Key to Who Gets Alzheimer's,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/20/health/fetal-gene-may-protect-brain-from-alzheimers-study-finds.html,"It is one of the big scientific mysteries of Alzheimer's disease: Why do some people whose brains accumulate the plaques and tangles so strongly associated with Alzheimer's not develop the disease? Now, a series of studies by Harvard scientists suggests a possible answer, one that could lead to new treatments if confirmed by other research. The memory and thinking problems of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, which affect an estimated seven million Americans, may be related to a failure in the brain's stress response system, the new research suggests. If this system is working well, it can protect the brain from abnormal Alzheimer's proteins; if it gets derailed, critical areas of the brain start degenerating. ""This is an extremely important study,"" said Li-Huei Tsai, director of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was not involved in the research but wrote a commentary accompanying the study. ""This is the first study that is really starting to provide a plausible pathway to explain why some people are more vulnerable to Alzheimer's than other people.""

The research, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, focuses on a protein previously thought to act mostly in the brains of developing fetuses. The scientists found that the protein also appears to protect neurons in healthy older people from aging-related stresses. But in people with Alzheimer's and other dementias, the protein is sharply depleted in key brain regions. Experts said if other scientists could replicate and expand upon the findings, the role of the protein, called REST, could spur development of new drugs for dementia, which has so far been virtually impossible to treat. But they cautioned that much more needed to be determined, including whether the decline of REST was a cause, or an effect, of brain deterioration, and whether it was specific enough to neurological diseases that it could lead to effective therapies. ""You're going to see a lot of papers now following up on it,"" said Dr. Eric M. Reiman, executive director of the Banner Alzheimer's Institute in Phoenix, who was not involved in the study. ""While it's a preliminary finding, it raises an avenue that hasn't been considered before. And if this provides a handle on which to understand normal brain aging, that will be great, too."" REST, a regulator that switches off certain genes, is primarily known to keep fetal neurons in an immature state until they develop to perform brain functions, said Dr. Bruce A. Yankner, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School and the lead author of the new study. By the time babies are born, REST becomes inactive, he said, except in some areas outside the brain like the colon, where it seems to suppress cancer. While investigating how different genes in the brain change as people age, Dr. Yankner's team was startled to find that REST was the most active gene regulator in older brains.

""Why should a fetal gene be coming on in an aging brain?"" he wondered. He hypothesized that it was because in aging, as in birth, brains encounter great stress, threatening neurons that cannot regenerate if harmed. His team discovered that REST appears to switch off genes that promote cell death, protecting neurons from normal aging processes like energy decrease, inflammation and oxidative stress. Analyzing brains from brain banks and dementia studies, the researchers found that brains of young adults ages 20 to 35 contained little REST, while healthy adults between the ages of 73 and 106 had plenty. REST levels grew the older people got, so long as they did not develop dementia, suggesting that REST is related to longevity. But in people with Alzheimer's, mild cognitive impairment, frontotemporal dementia and Lewy body dementia, the brain areas affected by these diseases contained much less REST than healthy brains. An image of tau tangles in the brain, often a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. A group of researchers has found that a protein, normally active in fetuses, may also protect the neurons in older people. This was true only in people who actually had memory and thinking problems. People who remained cognitively healthy, but whose brains had the same accumulation of amyloid plaques and tau tangles as people with Alzheimer's, had three times more REST than those suffering Alzheimer's symptoms. About a third of people who have such plaques will not develop Alzheimer's symptoms, studies show. REST levels dropped as symptoms worsened, so people with mild cognitive impairment had more REST than Alzheimer's patients. And only key brain regions were affected. In Alzheimer's, REST steeply declined in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, areas critical to learning, memory and planning. Other areas of the brain not involved in Alzheimer's showed no REST drop-off.

It is not yet possible to analyze REST levels in the brains of living people, and several Alzheimer's experts said that fact limited what the new research could prove. John Hardy, an Alzheimer's researcher at University College London, cautioned in an email that information from post-mortem brains could not prove that a decline in REST caused dementia because death might produce unrelated damage to brain cells. To investigate further, the team conducted what both Dr. Tsai and Dr. Reiman called a ""tour de force"" of research, examining REST in mice, roundworms and cells in the lab. ""We wanted to make sure the story was right,"" Dr. Yankner said. ""It was difficult to believe at first, to be honest with you."" Especially persuasive was that mice genetically engineered to lack REST lost neurons as they aged in brain areas afflicted in Alzheimer's. Dr. Yankner said REST appeared to work by traveling to a neuron's nucleus when the brain was stressed. In dementia, though, REST somehow gets diverted, traveling with toxic dementia-related proteins to another part of the neuron where it is eventually destroyed. Experts said the research, while intriguing, left many unanswered questions. Bradley Wise of the National Institute on Aging's neuroscience division, which helped finance the studies, said REST's role needed further clarification. ""I don't think you can really say if it's a cause of Alzheimer's or a consequence of Alzheimer's"" yet, he said.

Dr. Samuel E. Gandy, an Alzheimer's researcher at Mount Sinai Medical Center, wondered if REST figured only in neurodegenerative diseases or in other diseases, too, which could make it difficult to use REST to develop specific treatments or diagnostic tests for dementia. ""My ambivalence is, is this really a way that advances our understanding of the disease or does this just tell us this is even more complicated than we thought?"" he said. Dr. Yankner's team is looking at REST in other neurological diseases, like Parkinson's. He also has thoughts about a potential treatment, lithium, which he said appears to stimulate REST function, and is considered relatively safe. But he and other experts said it was too early. ""I would hesitate to start rushing into lithium treatment"" unless rigorous studies showed that it could forestall dementia, said Dr. John C. Morris, an Alzheimer's researcher at Washington University in St. Louis. Still, Dr. Morris said, the REST research the team conducted so far is ""very well done, and certainly helps support this idea that we've all tried to understand about why Alzheimer's is age-associated and why, while amyloid is necessary for the development of Alzheimer's disease, it certainly is not sufficient.""

Gandy, an Alzheimer's researcher at Mount Sinai Medical Center, wondered if REST figured only in neurodegenerative diseases or in other diseases, too, which could make it difficult to use REST to develop specific treatments or diagnostic tests for dementia. ""My ambivalence is, is this really a way that advances our understanding of the disease or does this just tell us this is even more complicated than we thought?"" he said. Dr. Yankner's team is looking at REST in other neurological diseases, like Parkinson's. He also has thoughts about a potential treatment, lithium, which he said appears to stimulate REST function, and is considered relatively safe. But he and other experts said it was too early. ""I would hesitate to start rushing into lithium treatment"" unless rigorous studies showed that it could forestall dementia, said Dr. John C. Morris, an Alzheimer's researcher at Washington University in St. Louis. Still, Dr. Morris said, the REST research the team conducted so far is ""very well done, and certainly helps support this idea that we've all tried to understand about why Alzheimer's is age-associated and why, while amyloid is necessary for the development of Alzheimer's disease, it certainly is not sufficient."" He added, ""There have to be some other processes and triggers that result in Alzheimer's."" The protein, which switches off at birth, reawakens in some older brains, protecting people from the memory and thinking problems of dementia, researchers say.",1,[1],1
Health,Congress Weighs Repeal of Tax Credit for Rare Disease Drugs,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/health/republican-tax-plan-orphan-drugs-rare-diseases.html,"A decades-old tax credit designed to spur cures for rare diseases has been so successful that it's now become a target in the House Republican tax plan. The proposal under consideration would end the tax breaks for development of what are called orphan drugs. Ending the credit used by big and small drug companies could save the government an estimated $54 billion over the next decade, an effort to help offset some of the anticipated losses in revenue if other Republican tax cut provisions become law. With the Senate poised to offer its own broad tax plan soon, many details are still in flux. But if the orphan drug tax credit is eliminated, the move would represent a rare defeat for the powerful pharmaceutical industry. The tax credit is part of the popular 1983 Orphan Drug Act, and is one of a host of incentives that supporters say have led to the approval of more than 500 new and much-needed drugs for those rare diseases that each affect fewer than 200,000 people. But the program has also come under scrutiny because critics say that some major drugmakers have exploited it by obtaining the orphan designation for billion-dollar blockbuster drugs like Humira for treating rheumatoid arthritis and Crestor, the cholesterol drug, that were already on the market.

Even if the proposal passes the House, it will likely face opposition in the Senate, particularly from Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, who is overseeing tax reform in the Senate and was a leading sponsor of the Orphan Drug Act. No matter what happens, some experts welcomed a discussion about a political issue that was once considered untouchable because opponents risked being labeled coldhearted toward people with serious medical conditions. ""I think it opens up the debate on the orphan drug tax credit, which we think is a flawed incentive,"" said James Love, director of the consumers group Knowledge Ecology International. ""And I think that's a positive thing."" Under current law, companies that develop drugs for rare diseases can receive a tax credit for half of the cost of their clinical trials and they are also granted seven years of exclusivity, when the drug is protected from competition. Companies are not required to disclose the amounts of the tax credits they receive. Mr. Love said he favored replacing the tax credit with direct government subsidies of clinical trials for rare-disease treatments.

In public, the pharmaceutical industry's largest lobbying groups have not said much about the credit. The Biotechnology Innovation Organization, whose members include smaller companies, praised the overall tax plan in a statement last week, but disagreed with the elimination of the tax credit. The other major trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, whose members are generally large public companies, said in a statement that it was pleased that Congress has taken up a tax overhaul and, without mentioning the tax credit, encouraged policymakers ""to maintain incentives"" for research into rare-disease treatments. Big drugmakers in particular stand to benefit more from the proposed lower corporate tax rate than from the loss of a tax credit that some companies do not use. And like other major corporations, the industry's opposition may be coalescing far more against a proposed excise tax that could penalize companies for manufacturing their products overseas. These days, many drugs are made outside the United States.

Companies that make drugs to treat rare diseases and their lobbyists are already marshaling forces to retain the tax credit. Tactics include enlisting patient-advocacy groups -- many financed by drug companies -- and members, whose life-threatening and debilitating diseases often have more of a compelling effect than pharmaceutical executives on lawmakers and the public. ""We didn't have any prior warning,"" said Paul Melmeyer, federal policy director for the National Organization for Rare Disorders, or NORD. ""We look at that just utter lack of therapies for our patient populations. There could be even 33 percent fewer than what we have, going forward, and that is really what our concern is."" Over the last decade, the number of new drugs to treat rare diseases has proliferated, in part because of advancements in scientific research and in part because drug companies have found new ways to profit from diseases that were once seen as unworthy of corporate investment. In 2016, nine of the 22 new drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration were for rare diseases; in 2015, 21 of the 45 drugs approved fell into that category. Despite the investment, advocates note that of the 7,000 rare diseases that have been identified, only about 5 percent have an approved therapy. About 30 million Americans have a rare disease, or about a tenth of the population.

While many rare-disease approvals bring advances for patients, companies have also been seen to be taking advantage of the program by seeking the designation for drugs that would be profitable anyway. The drugmaker AbbVie has won multiple approvals for rare-disease uses for Humira, the world's best-selling drug, ranging from a form of juvenile arthritis to an eye disease, uveitis. Many new cancer approvals also receive orphan-drug designation because they are targeted at a narrow slice of the population. With the coveted exclusivity granted by their orphan-drug status, companies can charge virtually anything they want for these products, and some manufacturers have set astronomical prices for drugs that have gone on to bring in billions in sales. Soliris, made by Alexion, racked up more than $2.8 billion in sales in 2016 even though it is only approved to treat three rare diseases. In May, three Republican senators, including Senator Hatch, asked the Government Accountability Office to look into possible abuses of the Orphan Drug Act, prompted by an investigation by Kaiser Health News. Mr. Melmeyer said he did not think the request showed a change of heart by Senator Hatch, who is chairman of the Finance Committee that may release its tax plan as early as Thursday. ""We're very much counting on him to step up and be the champion on this,"" Mr. Melmeyer said. In 2015, a report commissioned by the biotechnology trade group and NORD estimated that if the tax credit were removed, the number of drugs approved over the next decade would decline by 33 percent. Eric Davis, the executive vice president and general counsel of BioMarin Pharmaceutical, which develops what it describes as ""ultrarare"" drugs, said the tax credit ""is really critical to helping us get over the hump with our investment decisions, and I think that's true for a lot of companies in our space."" Philip English, a former Republican Congressman who now lobbies for drug firms, said he believed that his clients were picking up support from Republicans and said he was confident that the tax credit would survive any Senate plan. ""I think there is a consensus within the industry and within the advocacy community that the orphan drug credit has been immensely successful in generating innovative investment that has produced a string of successes,"" Mr. English said.","Long untouchable, the incentive for development of orphan drugs is now a Republican target as lawmakers consider a broad tax overhaul.",4930489a-fd78-53c3-9d99-681c4da543ff,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/09/science/09ORPHAN/09ORPHAN-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=a5d6682c6e33bc4f039f7bdb6c39bdd3e082e3dd2a26b2dac3077ce7c66afc73&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, on Capitol Hill in July, was a main sponsor of the decades-old Orphan Drug Act, which set up a tax credit to encourage drug companies to develop cures for rare diseases.",4930489a-fd78-53c3-9d99-681c4da543ff,Demo_data/D1_img2/14930489a-fd78-53c3-9d99-681c4da543ff.jpg,1,"Congress Weighs Repeal of Tax Credit for Rare Disease Drugs A decades-old tax credit designed to spur cures for rare diseases has been so successful that it's now become a target in the House Republican tax plan.

Opinion,The Postal Service Is the Most American Thing We've Got,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/opinion/postal-service-trump-coronavirus.html,"It would be difficult to think of a time when we have depended more on the United States Postal Service. With tens of millions of Americans quarantined in their homes, the steady delivery of checks, letters, food and medical supplies is a lifeline. That goes especially for the elderly, the sick and the poor, the people most affected by the virus. They have limited access to laptops and phones, so Zoom is not an option for them. For these citizens, the sight of a blue uniform six days a week reminds that their government is there for them. Strangely, that same government is trying to undermine one of its most effective instruments. President Trump has dismissed the Postal Service as ""a joke,"" and last week he named Louis DeJoy, a major Republican Party donor with no experience in the agency, as his next postmaster general, replacing a lifelong postal employee. The president has also demanded that the Postal Service quadruple its shipping prices, motivated in part, it seems, by the desire to hurt one of its big users, Amazon. Mr. Trump's drive to raise prices dovetails with the desire by many Republicans to either force the service to privatize or at least undercut it in favor of private shippers like FedEx.

If prices are quadrupled, it will briefly inconvenience Amazon, which will simply pass on the expenses to its customers. But for the Americans most reliant on home delivery, this will come as a heavy new tax. At the same time, the service is in financial trouble; without major new funding, the service will run out of money in September, well before the November election -- whose success may depend on a huge mail-in effort. The Postal Service was never supposed to be a moneymaking enterprise, or a political football. The founders understood that the reliable delivery of information was basic to democracy. In 1775, even before this country came into existence, the Continental Congress asked Benjamin Franklin to organize a postal system for the 13 colonies at war with a distant empire. George Washington deepened that commitment when he became president. In 1792, he and James Madison pushed an act through Congress establishing a national system of post offices and post roads. The legislation specifically set a low rate for newspapers, so that Americans could learn about the issues of the day. As Washington wrote in his annual message of 1791, a strong postal system was essential to democracy, and would help to spread ""a knowledge of the laws and proceedings of the government."" In the years that followed, Europeans marveled at the efficiency of the American system. Alexis de Tocqueville noted an ""astonishing circulation of letters and newspapers"" everywhere he went. In good times and bad, the mail went out, to all of the country's far-flung citizens. Even after the Civil War broke out, Abraham Lincoln insisted that the U.S. mail be delivered throughout the seceded states. So it was, for nearly two months, until the Confederacy established its own system, and broke off this last connection. Immodestly, Jefferson Davis created a stamp with his own image on it.

Many of the earliest letter carriers were wounded Civil War veterans, grateful for a chance to work. In the winter of 1862, a Cleveland postal clerk named Joseph W. Briggs felt sorry for the women he saw waiting in long lines in the cold for letters from the front, and proposed that letter carriers deliver the mail to people's homes. Before that, Americans picked up their mail in person at the local post office. Briggs's idea was approved, and ""free city delivery"" spread across the North. To help, cities and towns named all of their streets and created numbered addresses for each domicile, including the most modest apartments. As Lincoln understood, the Union included all of these homes, each of which was contributing in its way. They deserved their mail. Thousands were needed to carry out free city delivery, and the postal work force boomed. Many of the earliest letter carriers were wounded veterans, grateful for a chance to work. By hiring those who had given so much for their country, the Lincoln administration signaled that veterans could expect their country to look out for them -- an important precedent for future veterans programs, as well as the New Deal. Letter carriers took a pledge to act with courtesy toward all Americans. Their blue uniforms, introduced in 1868, were a pro-American statement. So was the idea that any place in the Union could be reached by these hearty mail carriers, carrying sacks of up to 75 pounds. The Postal Service helped to heal the country by uniting North and South into one system again, and the introduction of rural free delivery in 1896 connected farm families to the wider world. The mail even facilitated immigration, allowing young migrants to let relatives know their whereabouts. In 1889, more than 87 million letters were sent between the United States and Europe. Letter carriers delivered the mail through the 1918 flu pandemic, and every other crisis of the 20th century.

This rich tradition remains a source of pride for postal employees. The Postal Service has also strengthened democracy in a quieter way, through its commitment to diversity -- 39 percent of its employees are people of color, and 40 percent are women. Americans may be living apart, by necessity; but it does not necessarily follow that we must be so divided. Thanks to our letter carriers, we are not. They show up every day, binding Americans together, as Lincoln hoped they would. Every delivery is a small act of union.

The slogan on the old Farley Post Office building in New York proclaims these words: ""Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds."" They were added by one of the building's architects, William Mitchell Kendall, who found the lines in Herodotus. Awkwardly, they describe the efficiency of the Persian couriers, whose descendants now populate Iran -- an argument that may not win friends in the Trump administration. But if that inscription does not suit, there is another one close to the White House and the Capitol, easily read from the street, that reminds us of how much we get from our mail. The old Washington Post Office is now the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum, close to Union Station. The inscription over its west entrance asserts that a letter carrier is not only the ""consoler of the lonely,"" but the ""enlarger of the common life."" Common life endures, even in a crisis, as Washington, Lincoln and other presidents instinctively understood. Despite the president's claims, the Postal Service is no joke.

The Postal Service helped to heal the country by uniting North and South into one system again, and the introduction of rural free delivery in 1896 connected farm families to the wider world. The mail even facilitated immigration, allowing young migrants to let relatives know their whereabouts. In 1889, more than 87 million letters were sent between the United States and Europe. Letter carriers delivered the mail through the 1918 flu pandemic, and every other crisis of the 20th century.

This rich tradition remains a source of pride for postal employees. The Postal Service has also strengthened democracy in a quieter way, through its commitment to diversity -- 39 percent of its employees are people of color, and 40 percent are women. Americans may be living apart, by necessity; but it does not necessarily follow that we must be so divided. Thanks to our letter carriers, we are not. They show up every day, binding Americans together, as Lincoln hoped they would. Every delivery is a small act of union.

Washington and Lincoln would disagree.",,"The Postal Service Is the Most American Thing We've Got It would be difficult to think of a time when we have depended more on the United States Postal Service. With tens of millions of Americans quarantined in their homes, the steady delivery of checks, letters, food and medical supplies is a lifeline. That goes especially for the elderly, the sick and the poor, the people most affected by the virus. They have limited access to laptops and phones, so Zoom is not an option for them. For these citizens, the sight of a blue uniform six days a week reminds that their government is there for them. Strangely, that same government is trying to undermine one of its most effective instruments. President Trump has dismissed the Postal Service as ""a joke,"" and last week he named Louis DeJoy, a major Republican Party donor with no experience in the agency, as his next postmaster general, replacing a lifelong postal employee. The president has also demanded that the Postal Service quadruple its shipping prices, motivated in part, it seems, by the desire to hurt one of its big users, Amazon. Mr. Trump's drive to raise prices dovetails with the desire by many Republicans to either force the service to privatize or at least undercut it in favor of private shippers like FedEx.

If prices are quadrupled, it will briefly inconvenience Amazon, which will simply pass on the expenses to its customers. But for the Americans most reliant on home delivery, this will come as a heavy new tax. At the same time, the service is in financial trouble; without major new funding, the service will run out of money in September, well before the November election -- whose success may depend on a huge mail-in effort. The Postal Service was never supposed to be a moneymaking enterprise, or a political football. The founders understood that the reliable delivery of information was basic to democracy. In 1775, even before this country came into existence, the Continental Congress asked Benjamin Franklin to organize a postal system for the 13 colonies at war with a distant empire. George Washington deepened that commitment when he became president. In 1792, he and James Madison pushed an act through Congress establishing a national system of post offices and post roads. The legislation specifically set a low rate for newspapers, so that Americans could learn about the issues of the day. As Washington wrote in his annual message of 1791, a strong postal system was essential to democracy, and would help to spread ""a knowledge of the laws and proceedings of the government."" In the years that followed, Europeans marveled at the efficiency of the American system. Alexis de Tocqueville noted an ""astonishing circulation of letters and newspapers"" everywhere he went. In good times and bad, the mail went out, to all of the country's far-flung citizens. Even after the Civil War broke out, Abraham Lincoln insisted that the U.S. mail be delivered throughout the seceded states. So it was, for nearly two months, until the Confederacy established its own system, and broke off this last connection. Immodestly, Jefferson Davis created a stamp with his own image on it.

Many of the earliest letter carriers were wounded Civil War veterans, grateful for a chance to work. In the winter of 1862, a Cleveland postal clerk named Joseph W. Briggs felt sorry for the women he saw waiting in long lines in the cold for letters from the front, and proposed that letter carriers deliver the mail to people's homes. Before that, Americans picked up their mail in person at the local post office. Briggs's idea was approved, and ""free city delivery"" spread across the North. To help, cities and towns named all of their streets and created numbered addresses for each domicile, including the most modest apartments. As Lincoln understood, the Union included all of these homes, each of which was contributing in its way. They deserved their mail. Thousands were needed to carry out free city delivery, and the postal work force boomed. Many of the earliest letter carriers were wounded veterans, grateful for a chance to work. By hiring those who had given so much for their country, the Lincoln administration signaled that veterans could expect their country to look out for them -- an important precedent for future veterans programs, as well as the New Deal.

Real Estate,Priced Out of a Childhood Home,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/realestate/priced-out-of-my-childhood-home.html,"When Carolyn Burke landed a teaching job nearly three years ago at a charter school in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, she saw it as an opportunity to move back to her childhood neighborhood. This was where Ms. Burke's parents, immigrants from Barbados, introduced her to art at the Brooklyn Museum, blocks from the family's basement apartment on Eastern Parkway near Franklin Avenue. Her father now had cancer, so moving back home took on a new urgency. The neighborhood, once burdened by drugs, crime and racial strife, has changed in the decade since Ms. Burke left home. Nail salons, bodegas and 99-cent stores along Franklin Avenue have been joined by shops selling brick-oven pizza and craft beers. New rentals and condominiums have risen in place of dilapidated buildings, attracting young professionals and white couples pushing strollers. But it was not until she started apartment-hunting that Ms. Burke, who describes herself as Afro-Caribbean, realized that all the changes left little room for her. Ms. Burke had been living in Harlem, paying $1,400 a month for a two-bedroom walk-up. In Crown Heights, a broker showed her a two-bedroom, for $3,500 a month, so small that it did not have a full-size oven. She applied unsuccessfully for other apartments.

In interviews with about a dozen young native New Yorkers, all from areas where real estate prices have soared and new residents have poured in, mixed emotions surfaced about the consequences of gentrification. Some of those interviewed were members of minority groups, some were white; all were between the ages of 23 and 34. For some, new restaurants, shops and services were welcome, especially if amenities had once been sparse, but to others, they seemed like a hostile takeover. Some said the old sense of community had disappeared in construction dust. None had been able to afford an apartment of their own in their childhood neighborhoods. A few said that moving had offered them a chance to discover a new swath of the city. But others simply felt unmoored.

""There is definitely a sense of bewilderment,"" said Jamie Fedorko, a salesman for Warburg Realty who specializes in Brooklyn. When rents prove out of reach, ""the conversation among New York transplants is, 'Well, I can go home.' But for New Yorkers, where is that?"" And, when residents displaced by gentrification move into neighborhoods they can afford, they are often considered gentrifiers, too. Young people face a daunting path in the city. Although 18- to 29-year-olds are the most educated group of young workers in the city's history, they earned about 20 percent less in real wages in 2014 than they would have in 2000, according to a report by the office of Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller. The environment is particularly tough for young blacks, who faced an 11.4 percent unemployment rate in 2014, more than double the 5.2 percent experienced by young whites, according to the report. At the same time, rents in predominantly black neighborhoods are rising at a faster clip than in wealthier areas, putting added pressure on young people whose parents may not be able to help their offspring pay the rent or guarantee a lease. While wealthier peers might be able to lean on their parents financially, young members of minority groups like Ms. Burke are more likely to need to help out their parents.

She eventually found a two-bedroom apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant for less than $3,000 a month. Her place is 30 minutes away by bus and subway from her parents' home in Crown Heights. With rising rents come shops and services aimed at new arrivals with deep pockets. ""Developers and real estate agents tend to favor the newcomers, and the newcomers tend to be white and affluent,"" said Derek Hyra, the director of the Metropolitan Policy Center at American University. ""The amenities that are being placed in these communities are signaling to young whites: You're welcome here."" Lifelong residents, meanwhile, receive very different signals. Havanna Fisher was in elementary school in 1999 when Starbucks arrived on West 125th Street in Harlem. As other national chains moved in, Ms. Fisher attended community meetings with her mother, a carpenter. ""At the beginning, people thought it was for us,"" said Ms. Fisher, now a 25-year-old artist who still lives in the rent-regulated apartment on West 138th Street where she was raised. But some neighbors, including her mother, worried that the changes were ominous. ""Although I wanted to believe that it was something that was good,"" Ms. Fisher said, ""I didn't have too much faith.""

Many of Ms. Fisher's friends have moved away -- to New Jersey and the Bronx -- in search of cheaper rent. ""They're just angry, upset and hurt,"" she said. ""It hurts not to be able to live in a community that you grew up in."" No neighborhood, of course, is impervious to change. Young people who grew up in wealthier parts of the city have had to contend with prices that eclipse their junior salaries. They, too, find themselves living in cramped quarters in distant neighborhoods or sleeping in their childhood bedrooms well into their 20s. But the transformations wrought by gentrification can reshape a community within a very few years, potentially erasing a neighborhood's history and identity. Both those who leave and those who stay behind grapple with unrecognizable landscapes. ""They lose their church, they lose their youth organization, they lose their neighbors,"" said Dr. Mindy Thompson Fullilove, a research psychiatrist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Replacing these things can take decades, she said. ""It's a very devastating, stressful, unhappy experience, and it makes people very angry.""

But the old neighborhood does not seem much like home, either. Many of the new stores and businesses that have moved in, Mr. Ghareb said, don't appear to have the locals in mind. Last year, Ice & Vice, an ice cream shop, opened near Mr. Ghareb's home. The shop, dedicated to handcrafted ice cream made from ingredients like beer, blue corn and ""lobster"" croutons, sells $12 pints. ""If you live somewhere and you can't visit the local ice cream shop regularly without it hurting your bank account,"" Mr. Ghareb said, ""then you don't belong there anymore."" Being priced out of the nest is not always a loss. Sometimes it means the start of a new chapter. Two years ago, Chyann Sapp, who describes herself as African-American, decided it was time to move out of her mother's apartment on West 120th Street in Harlem. Ms. Sapp, a playwright and a saleswoman for Citi Habitats real estate, didn't necessarily mean to leave Harlem, but she found the rents to be ""just insane,"" she said. So she widened her search to include the Bronx, a borough she barely knew.

Barbara Johnson, 58, Ms. Sapp's mother, said: ""I was excited for her, but I was scared and nervous. But it's different now. A lot more streetlights, a lot more police officers. I feel at ease when she leaves me and goes home."" Since Ms. Sapp arrived, Blink Fitness opened on Macombs Road in Mount Eden, about a half-mile from her apartment. More people are moving to the area, many priced out of Harlem and starting another wave of migration -- and displacement. The gentrification experience can be different for parents who have remained in the old neighborhood, because they live in a rent-regulated apartment or own a home that has perhaps greatly appreciated in value. ""The neighborhood being up-and-coming is a status symbol for them,"" said Ms. Burke, the teacher from Crown Heights. ""It's like, 'Look at us, we've always lived here, but now it's a place where people are clawing down doors to get in.' "" Her mother appreciates the new amenities in Crown Heights, particularly the arrival of a bank branch on her corner and shops selling organic produce. ""Before, you couldn't even get a bagel in this neighborhood,"" said Myrna Burke, 64. Nor does she miss the days when she worried if her children would be safe walking home from the subway station on Franklin Avenue. ""Now on a weekend, it is so busy,"" she said. ""On Saturday, you come out of your door and it's like, 'Whoa!' It's nice. It's more lively."" Two years ago, Andre Springer, an artist, was renting an apartment for around $900 a month on the top floor of his mother's townhouse in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Then she decided to sell the building that she bought in 1996 for around $150,000. Mr. Springer, 33, handled the sale for his mother, Jacqueline Spencer, 56, an immigrant from Barbados who works for the Department of Education. He listed the building on Decatur Street for $1.2 million, hoping to deliver her a comfortable retirement. The house ultimately sold early last year for $825,000, falling short of expectations, but Ms. Spencer was able to buy a house in Rosedale, Queens, with the proceeds. Mr. Springer now pays $700 a month for a bedroom in a two-bedroom apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, receiving a discount for walking a dog. Mr. Springer has mixed feelings about relinquishing his childhood home. ""She saw the opportunity to sell her home and be in a quieter neighborhood. But for me, it kind of hurt,"" he said. Until she moved away, ""I always felt like I had a place to go back to, a place that I could call my own.""","When a New York neighborhood becomes gentrified, young people who grew up there may be displaced.",17fe5dcd-289d-542d-beb2-2578f44576dc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/15/realestate/15COV4/15COV4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=a55eb9e2d2afd39e5d04472f2c3936b65919896015c595634d428d4ee69815da&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Carolyn Burke, a teacher, in front of her old home in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.

Young people who grew up in wealthier parts of the city have had to contend with prices that eclipse their junior salaries. They, too, find themselves living in cramped quarters in distant neighborhoods or sleeping in their childhood bedrooms well into their 20s. But the transformations wrought by gentrification can reshape a community within a very few years, potentially erasing a neighborhood's history and identity. Both those who leave and those who stay behind grapple with unrecognizable landscapes. ""They lose their church, they lose their youth organization, they lose their neighbors,"" said Dr. Mindy Thompson Fullilove, a research psychiatrist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Replacing these things can take decades, she said. ""It's a very devastating, stressful, unhappy experience, and it makes people very angry.""

But the old neighborhood does not seem much like home, either. Many of the new stores and businesses that have moved in, Mr. Ghareb said, don't appear to have the locals in mind. Last year, Ice & Vice, an ice cream shop, opened near Mr. Ghareb's home. The shop, dedicated to handcrafted ice cream made from ingredients like beer, blue corn and ""lobster"" croutons, sells $12 pints. ""If you live somewhere and you can't visit the local ice cream shop regularly without it hurting your bank account,"" Mr. Ghareb said, ""then you don't belong there anymore."" Being priced out of the nest is not always a loss. Sometimes it means the start of a new chapter. Two years ago, Chyann Sapp, who describes herself as African-American, decided it was time to move out of her mother's apartment on West 120th Street in Harlem. Ms. Sapp, a playwright and a saleswoman for Citi Habitats real estate, didn't necessarily mean to leave Harlem, but she found the rents to be ""just insane,"" she said. So she widened her search to include the Bronx, a borough she barely knew.

Barbara Johnson, 58, Ms. Sapp's mother, said: ""I was excited for her, but I was scared and nervous. But it's different now. A lot more streetlights, a lot more police officers. I feel at ease when she leaves me and goes home."" Since Ms. Sapp arrived, Blink Fitness opened on Macombs Road in Mount Eden, about a half-mile from her apartment. More people are moving to the area, many priced out of Harlem and starting another wave of migration -- and displacement. The gentrification experience can be different for parents who have remained in the old neighborhood, because they live in a rent-regulated apartment or own a home that has perhaps greatly appreciated in value. ""The neighborhood being up-and-coming is a status symbol for them,"" said Ms. Burke, the teacher from Crown Heights. ""It's like, 'Look at us, we've always lived here, but now it's a place where people are clawing down doors to get in.' "" Her mother appreciates the new amenities in Crown Heights, particularly the arrival of a bank branch on her corner and shops selling organic produce. ""Before, you couldn't even get a bagel in this neighborhood,"" said Myrna Burke, 64. Nor does she miss the days when she worried if her children would be safe walking home from the subway station on Franklin Avenue. ""Now on a weekend, it is so busy,"" she said. ""On Saturday, you come out of your door and it's like, 'Whoa!' It's nice. It's more lively."" Two years ago, Andre Springer, an artist, was renting an apartment for around $900 a month on the top floor of his mother's townhouse in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Then she decided to sell the building that she bought in 1996 for around $150,000. Mr. Springer, 33, handled the sale for his mother, Jacqueline Spencer, 56, an immigrant from Barbados who works for the Department of Education. He listed the building on Decatur Street for $1.2 million, hoping to deliver her a comfortable retirement. The house ultimately sold early last year for $825,000, falling short of expectations, but Ms. Spencer was able to buy a house in Rosedale, Queens, with the proceeds. Mr. Springer now pays $700 a month for a bedroom in a two-bedroom apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, receiving a discount for walking a dog. Mr. Springer has mixed feelings about relinquishing his childhood home. ""She saw the opportunity to sell her home and be in a quieter neighborhood. But for me, it kind of hurt,"" he said. Until she moved away, ""I always felt like I had a place to go back to, a place that I could call my own."" When a New York neighborhood becomes gentrified, young people who grew up there may be displaced.",7,['7'],7
Technology,"Airbnb, a 'Sharing Economy' Pioneer, Files to Go Public",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/technology/airbnb-ipo.html,"The Airbnb headquarters in San Francisco. Its debut will most likely be helped by a strong stock market.





SAN FRANCISCO -- Airbnb said on Wednesday that it had confidentially filed to go public, taking a key step toward one of the largest public market debuts in a generation of ""sharing economy"" start-ups. A public offering by the company, which lets people rent out their spare rooms or homes to travelers, would cap a volatile year in which its business was devastated by the spread of the coronavirus. Airbnb had been privately valued at $31 billion before this year, and the company must now convince investors that it can thrive and turn a profit in a new era of limited travel. Airbnb declined to comment beyond its brief announcement. Airbnb's offering would signal the end of an era for the first wave of highly valued start-up ""unicorns,"" many of which were founded in the recession of 2008 and then rode a wave of growth fueled by smartphones, gig work and copious amounts of venture capital. In recent years, many of Airbnb's well-known ""sharing economy"" peers have gone public (Uber and Lyft), sold themselves (Postmates), or unraveled spectacularly (WeWork). Its debut will most likely be helped by an ebullient stock market, which has remained robust despite the economic destruction caused by the pandemic. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 hit a new high as investors focused on signs that the worst might be over, and on Wednesday, Apple became the first U.S. company to hit a $2 trillion market value.

Airbnb's initial public offering plan shows the resilience of the tech industry in the pandemic and an investor appetite for tech stocks, said Ted Smith, president of Union Square Advisors, a tech-focused financial advisory firm. ""There's going to be some choppiness in the short term until we get through the pandemic,"" he said. ""But I think it mirrors the overall faith that the market seems to have in the long term."" Start-ups have taken advantage of the excitement for technology. Tech companies including Lemonade, an insurance provider, and ZoomInfo, a business database company, watched their prices soar after listing over the summer. Other start-ups such as Palantir, a data company founded by Peter Thiel, and Asana, a collaboration technology provider run by the Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, are also planning to go public this year. Many are pushing to reach the market before the November election, which typically creates volatility in the stock market. Palantir and Asana declined to comment. Airbnb was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk and Joe Gebbia as a way to help people make extra money renting out their spare rooms. The platform has spread to almost every country, amassing seven million listings and attracting $3 billion in funding from venture capital firms including Andreessen Horowitz, Founders Fund and Sequoia Capital.

Airbnb takes a cut of the stays and activities that its rental operators book. It has come closer to turning a profit than Uber or WeWork -- until the coronavirus evaporated more than $1 billion of bookings almost overnight. In the spring, Airbnb projected its revenue for 2020 would drop to half of the $4.8 billion it brought in last year. The company quickly cut costs, raised emergency funding, laid off almost 2,000 employees and shelved its plans to go public.

""It really did feel like a moment of truth, a bit of a test,"" Mr. Chesky, Airbnb's chief executive, said in an interview this year. In May, Airbnb's revenue began bouncing back as people took summer road trips and sought to stay in private homes away from crowds. The company's gross bookings -- which is its total revenue before it pays commissions to hosts -- rose to last year's levels in June and July, according an internal presentation attended by The New York Times. Perennially an I.P.O. candidate, Airbnb has been officially preparing to go public since last year when it announced plans to do so in 2020. Pressure for the offering has mounted as some of its early employees have sought a payday from the company shares that they own, which begin expiring this fall. Last month, Mr. Chesky announced to employees that Airbnb had resumed its plans to go public, declaring that Airbnb ""was down but we were not out."" The company is likely to pitch investors on its fast rebound and ability to adapt to the new reality, but some forms of travel -- like international vacations, business travel or anything related to large events -- are unlikely to return anytime soon.

Health,"Stay 6 Feet Apart, We're Told. But How Far Can Air Carry Coronavirus?",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-six-feet.html,"The rule of thumb, or rather feet, has been to stand six feet apart in public. That's supposed to be a safe distance if a person nearby is coughing or sneezing and is infected with the novel coronavirus, spreading droplets that may carry virus particles. And scientists agree that six feet is a sensible and useful minimum distance, but, some say, farther away would be better. Six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But some scientists, having looked at studies of air flow and being concerned about smaller particles called aerosols, suggest that people consider a number of factors, including their own vulnerability and whether they are outdoors or in an enclosed room, when deciding whether six feet is enough distance.

No scientists are suggesting a wholesale change in behavior, or proposing that some other length for separation from another human, like seven, or nine feet, is actually the right one. ""Everything is about probability,"" said Dr. Harvey Fineberg, who is the head of the Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. ""Three feet is better than nothing. Six feet is better than three feet. At that point, the larger drops have pretty much fallen down. Maybe if you're out of spitting range, that could be even safer, but six feet is a pretty good number."" One complicating factor is that aerosols, smaller droplets that can be emitted when people are breathing and talking, play some role in spreading the new coronavirus. Studies have shown that aerosols can be created during certain hospital or laboratory procedures like when using nebulizers to help patients inhale medication, which makes such procedures risky for doctors who do them. If the aerosols that people exhale in other settings are significant in spreading the disease, the six-foot distance would not be completely protective because those are carried more easily by air currents.

Aerosols are generally considered to be particles under 5 microns in diameter, about the size of a red blood cell, and can be spread in the environment by talking and breathing. But some researchers argue that this is a false dichotomy. Infectious droplets can't easily be divided into those that are big enough to fall to the ground quickly and those that stay aloft because so much depends on environmental conditions and how deeply they penetrate into the respiratory tract. ""It's really a continuum,"" said Dr. Donald Milton, who studies bioaerosols at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. Even without the launching power of a sneeze, air currents could carry a flow of aerosol sized virus particles exhaled by an infected person 20 feet or more away. ""In any confined geometry like an office room, meeting room, department store, food store,"" said Eugene Chudnovsky, a physicist at Lehman College and the City University of New York's Graduate Center. In a study not yet peer reviewed, he analyzed air flow and showed how, ""the vortices in the air are taking the virus to different places."" A preliminary study at the University of Nebraska Medical Center found evidence of coronavirus genetic material on various surfaces in isolation rooms where infected patients were being treated, including on air vents more than six feet from the patients. The research, which has not yet been peer reviewed, indicates that the virus can occasionally travel long distances. ""The virus is so small, it can hitch a ride even on tiny, tiny particles,"" Dr. Fineberg said. ""But how important is each size and how well they can transmit disease is not fully understood."" It is also unclear how many virus particles it takes to start an infection, how long the viral particles remain viable or if studies like the one in Nebraska simply detected the genetic calling card the virus left behind.

Spacing is an effective solution because it also reduces the number of people in a confined space. That reduces the likelihood of an infected person being in the group. And if there is one, fewer other people might be infected. Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the six-foot distance would clearly ""reduce the number of droplets you come in contact with. I have no doubt about that."" But, he said: ""The question is what does it take for you to get infected? And that I think is the trillion-dollar question we have."" He said, ""Maybe all it takes is an aerosol. You don't need any droplets at all."" If that's the case, he said, then someone who is at high risk would not want to be in the same room with someone who is infected or might be infected. Current guidelines already suggest that anyone at high risk should stay home and not be out in public in the first place. And they seem to be working. Places where people reduced travel and started social distancing weeks ago, especially in California, New York and Washington, are starting to show a reduction in the number of new coronavirus cases. People still need to shop and take care of necessities, Dr. Osterholm said, but reducing the risk of exposure to all possible modes of transmission -- infected surfaces, droplets and smaller aerosols -- is important. ""Your job is to limit it as much as you can.""","Most of the big droplets travel a mere six feet.

""In any confined geometry like an office room, meeting room, department store, food store,"" said Eugene Chudnovsky, a physicist at Lehman College and the City University of New York's Graduate Center. In a study not yet peer reviewed, he analyzed air flow and showed how, ""the vortices in the air are taking the virus to different places."" A preliminary study at the University of Nebraska Medical Center found evidence of coronavirus genetic material on various surfaces in isolation rooms where infected patients were being treated, including on air vents more than six feet from the patients. The research, which has not yet been peer reviewed, indicates that the virus can occasionally travel long distances. ""The virus is so small, it can hitch a ride even on tiny, tiny particles,"" Dr. Fineberg said. ""But how important is each size and how well they can transmit disease is not fully understood."" It is also unclear how many virus particles it takes to start an infection, how long the viral particles remain viable or if studies like the one in Nebraska simply detected the genetic calling card the virus left behind.

Spacing is an effective solution because it also reduces the number of people in a confined space. That reduces the likelihood of an infected person being in the group. And if there is one, fewer other people might be infected. Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said the six-foot distance would clearly ""reduce the number of droplets you come in contact with. I have no doubt about that."" But, he said: ""The question is what does it take for you to get infected? And that I think is the trillion-dollar question we have."" He said, ""Maybe all it takes is an aerosol. You don't need any droplets at all."" If that's the case, he said, then someone who is at high risk would not want to be in the same room with someone who is infected or might be infected. Current guidelines already suggest that anyone at high risk should stay home and not be out in public in the first place. And they seem to be working. Places where people reduced travel and started social distancing weeks ago, especially in California, New York and Washington, are starting to show a reduction in the number of new coronavirus cases. People still need to shop and take care of necessities, Dr. Osterholm said, but reducing the risk of exposure to all possible modes of transmission -- infected surfaces, droplets and smaller aerosols -- is important. ""Your job is to limit it as much as you can."" Most of the big droplets travel a mere six feet. The role of tiny aerosols is the ""trillion-dollar question.""",1,[1],1
Music,The Country-Rap Song Taking Over Nashville? It Isn't 'Old Town Road',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/arts/music/blanco-brown-the-git-up-old-town-road.html,"The second most-viewed version of Blanco Brown's ""The Git Up"" on YouTube -- after the original, audio-only clip -- is a video in which he teaches the country singer Lainey Wilson the song's accompanying dance. ""The Git Up"" is an instructional number: almost every lyric is a direction for where to place your foot, your arm, your cup. And it has been extremely popular on TikTok, the social-video sharing app. In the casual video, the two dance side by side in a parking lot, Wilson taking her cues from Brown, sashaying and spinning and doing the butterfly just a split second behind him. It's all very amiable and inclusive -- it would be hard to feel like you couldn't be in that parking lot, too.

And yet not even four months have passed since Billboard heaved Lil Nas X's ""Old Town Road"" off the same chart, saying it ""does not embrace enough elements of today's country music to chart in its current version."" (The remix with Billy Ray Cyrus, an actual onetime country star, fared no better, apart from spending 14 weeks and counting at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.) The apparent about-face shows that the country music industry isn't strict in its dogma , only in its hypocrisy. It is historically cloistered, presenting significant roadblocks to outsiders -- the charts reflect those pressures. (Just ask the women of country music.) But there are several reasons ""The Git Up"" thrived where ""Old Town Road"" failed. Brown is signed to a country music record label (BBR Music Group). He deploys a country twang earned growing up spending summers in the rural South. He plays lap steel guitar. The most crucial reason might be structural. ""Old Town Road"" didn't arrive through Nashville's front door. It rose up from the SoundCloud murk with an arched eyebrow, fortified by the language of memes. On TikTok, where young people transformed into cowboys to its theatrically comic country boom-bap, it was a shared idiom. It leapfrogged right over the country music industry to the pop world, leaving Nashville in the cold, and resentful.

In the clip featuring the renegade syndicated morning radio host Bobby Bones and the singer Caylee Hammack, Brown appears mysteriously in the background about halfway through, like a curious judge, before joining in. There's at least one -- and likely soon to be many more -- of Brown demonstrating the dance for hapless radio D.J.s around the country (though credit goes to Otis Oshow of 94.9 The Bull in Atlanta, who appeared grateful to have an opportunity to show off his rhythm). Where ""Old Town Road"" demanded engagement on its own flamboyant terms, ""The Git Up"" is an extended hand of camaraderie. These videos are testaments to cross-cultural understanding, and they are premised upon a fundamental lack of it. What Brown offers here is cachet, a little confidence, an opportunity to safely transgress while not fundamentally disrupting the genre's power dynamic. Brown, 34, has a career that predates ""The Git Up,"" working behind the scenes with both country and pop stars, including Fergie and Kane Brown. ""The Git Up,"" he's said in interviews, is part of a sound he calls ""trailertrap"" -- ""country music with 808s , hi-hat snares, kick drums and beatboxing.""

Or in other words, the same country-rap framework that Lil Nas X was working with (albeit flecked with irony in his case), and which has been deployed in Nashville by country rappers like Colt Ford and crossover stars like Sam Hunt. For the most part, that sound has been held at bay by country tastemakers. ""The Git Up"" is still more of a viral concern than a radio presence in Nashville. Though it has received a smattering of spins on country radio, it hasn't even appeared on Billboard's country airplay chart. So even if the song 's a little dim , ""The Git Up"" appearing on a country chart, and topping it, is significant. Whether the track is being included on the basis of its genre bona fides is dubious at best -- it is the very definition of a novelty song. ""The Git Up"" is the Hokey Pokey, the Hustle, the Macarena (which is not, in fact, about a dance, though it was popularized via a dance). It could have been a ""Hee Haw"" sketch. The lap steel -- played by Brown -- is just a touch fuzzy, as if plucked off some old 78 r.p.m. record. It is warm, welcoming shtick. But while ""The Git Up"" is lighthearted fun, it doesn't make much of a case for Brown as an artist. As a singer, he has an interesting, rich voice, as heard in a video of him singing a Chris Stapleton song backstage at the Grand Ole Opry a few days ago.","Billboard removed Lil Nas X's ""country trap"" record from a country chart.
